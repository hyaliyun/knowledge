In April 1942 he and another RAAF airman exchanged identities with two soldiers, and were able to join a working party outside the camp. In June, Chisholm and several others escaped, but they were recaptured near Brno, in Czechoslovakia, and returned to Lamsdorf Prisoner of War camp. Successful escape In August 1942, having again swapped his identity, Chisholm and three others managed to escape from a work camp near Gliwice. After a week they made contact with sympathetic Poles, and were taken to a resistance leader in Krak√≥w. Chisholm lived with a Polish family in Warsaw for much of this time. Various plans for escape back to England were developed and abandoned as the war progressed. The official account of his escape notes a degree of audacity in his activities; on one occasion, when a fellow escapee's papers were challenged in Poland, he pushed a policeman into the Vistula river to effect their escape. Finally, in March 1944, Chisholm and a Dutch refugee left Poland by train for Berlin, using money and forged papers obtained from the Polish resistance. After a day spent in Berlin; \\"Visiting cinemas, viewing bomb damage and dining in restaurants,\\" Chisholm and his partner departed by train for Brussels. After many delays, Chisholm reached Paris on 10 May 1944. Here he lived with a policeman and joined the French Forces of the Interior, until, with liberation, he was able to return to England on 30 August 1944.WWII Escape and Evasion Information Exchange website Official War historian John Hetherington commented; Chisholm was the first Empire trainee to win the Distinguished Flying Medal.

The name comes from the Bengali word for French which is Forashi and ganj, meaning market-town.  History  Farashganj literally means French town, it takes its name from French merchants based in Dhaka city. In 1740 the French East India Company started operations in Dhaka and built their \\"Kuthi\\" near Ahsan Manzil Palace with permission from Nowazish Mohammad Khan. The French got into minor conflicts with the British over a factory but was resolved through the mediation of Naib Nazim Jasarat Khan. The French merchants established wholesale trading posts for spices like raw turmeric, ginger, garlic and chilli. They built fine residences such as the Ruplal House. In the late nineteenth century, an influx of lumber-yards and wooden furniture manufacturers made the neighborhood, \\"the new furniture centre of Dacca\\".  Geography  Farashganj is located on the northern bank of the Buriganga River in Old Dhaka. Its principal thoroughfares are B. K. Das Road and Ahsanullah Road.  Points of interest  There are a number of historic buildings in Farashganj, mostly dilapidated. The stately two-story riverside mansion Ruplal House is now occupied by squatters. The once magnificent 19th-century mansion Bara Bari, with its ornate curved balconies over the street, has been partly demolished. Loharpul bridge also located in Farashganj. It was a great engineering feat at that time.

The Circumcision was also the occasion of the naming of Jesus, and by this period the emphasis of Catholic devotion was on the Holy Name of Jesus. The work was commissioned by the local Confraternity of the Holy Name of Jesus for the altar of the Circumcision Chapel in the church of San Francesco, Volterra, where Signorelli was working for the Medicis. Like many Renaissance versions of the subject it conflates it with the Presentation of Jesus by including at the rear Simeon. The Renaissance art historian and artist Giorgio Vasari saw the painting and described it as damaged by humidity, the Child having been repainted by Il Sodoma. The painting was acquired by the National Gallery in 1882. Description The background is formed by a sumptuous niche with polychrome marbles, with two medallions portraying a Prophet and a Sibyl. It is perhaps a citation of the Brera Altarpiece by Signorelli's master, Piero della Francesca.

The Fronimo Dialogo di Vincentio Galilei (Vincenzo Galilei) is an instructional book on playing, composing and intabulating vocal music for the lute. The first edition was printed by Girolamo Scotto in Venice with the full title FRONIMO DIALOGO / DI VINCENTIO GALILEI FIORENTINO, / NEL QUALE SI CONTENGONO LE VERE, / et necessarie regole del Intavolare la Musica nel Liuto. While the title page bears the date 1568, the final page confusingly bears the date 1569. Apparently, although the manuscript was completed by Galilei in the Autumn of 1568, the official letter of privilege allowing the publication of the book was received only in December, and the printing actually took place in 1569. In addition, still in 1569, Girolamo Scotto broke the book into two parts, selling a collection of 30 musical selections from near the end of the book and the Dialogo separately. A second edition of the complete Dialogo, with significant revisions, was printed in 1584 by the ‚Äúheir of Girolamo Scotto,‚Äù under the title FRONIMO / DIALOGO / DI VINCENTIO GALILEI / NOBILE FIORENTINO, / SOPRA L'ARTE DEL BENE INTAVOLARE, / ET RETTAMENTE SONARE LA MUSICA / Negli strumenti artificiali si di corde come di fiato, & in particulare nel Liuto. Unlike other lute instruction manuals of the 16th century, each of the editions of Fronimo contains quite a large amount of music. Galilei provided examples in order to illustrate how he believed compositions should be structured and how intabulations should be made from existing compositions. The examples range from a few notes or measures in length up to complete compositions in either mensural notation or lute tablature. In the 1584 edition, for example, there are 48 pieces in tablature form sprinkled throughout the text (including a set of 24 ricercars in all the possible tonalities) and a collection of 60 more pieces placed all together at the end. The 1568 edition includes a total of 96 complete pieces, many of which are different from those chosen for the 1584 edition.

Its territory bordered upon that of Sicyon on the east and upon that of Aegeira on the west. Pellene was situated 60 stadia from the sea, upon a strongly fortified hill, the summit of which rose into an inaccessible peak, dividing the city into two parts. Its port was at Aristonautae. Mythology and proto- history Its name was derived by the inhabitants themselves from the giant Pallas, and by the Argives from the Argive Pellen, a son of Phorbas.-14Apollon. 1.176. Pellene was a city of great antiquity. It is mentioned in the Homeric Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad; and according to a tradition, preserved by Thucydides, the inhabitants of Scione in the peninsula of Pallene in Macedonia professed to be descended from the Achaean Pallenians, who were driven on the Macedonian coast, on their return from Troy. History At the commencement of the Peloponnesian War, Pellene was the only one of the Achaean towns which espoused the Spartan cause, though the other states afterwards followed their example. It was a member of the first Achaean League until that League was dissolved by Alexander the Great. In the time of Alexander the Great, Pellene fell under the dominion of one of its citizens of the name of Chaeron, a distinguished athlete, who raised himself to the tyranny by Alexander's assistance. Around 270/265 BCE it was again a democracy joining the revived Achaean League. In the wars which followed the re- establishment of the Achaean League, Pellene was several times taken and re- taken by the contending parties. In 241 BCE Pellene was briefly conquered by the Aetolian League, but the raiding party was expelled by Aratus of Sicyon in the Battle of Pellene.Plutarch, Aratus, 31‚Äì32; In 225 BCE it was captured by Cleomenes III of Sparta, but after the successful intervention of Macedon it was returned to Achaea the following year.Plutarch, Aratus, 39. Pellene remained a member of the Achaean League until the Roman conquest in 146 BCE. Description The buildings of Pellene are described by Pausanias. et seq. Of these, the most important were a temple of Athena, with a statue of the goddess, said to have been one of the earlier works of Pheidias; a temple of Dionysus Lampter, in whose honour a festival, Lampteria, was celebrated; a temple of Apollo Theoxenius, to whom a festival, Theoxenia, was celebrated; a gymnasium, and more. Sixty stadia from the city was the Mysaeum (ŒúœçœÉŒ±ŒπŒøŒΩ), a temple of the Mysian Demeter; and near it a temple of Asclepius, called Cyrus (Œö·ø¶œÅŒøœÇ): at both of these places there were copious springs. Between Aegium and Pellene, ancient writers mention a village also called Pellene, celebrated for the manufacture of a particular kind of cloaks, which were given as prizes in the agonistic contests in the city.Pindar O. 9.146, with Schol.; Aristophanes The Birds 1421, with Schol.; Hesych. and Phot. s. v.

History On 16 March, 1936, Adolf Hitler ordered the institution of a service award in four classes, each class reflecting the completion of a select number of years of military service. The award was bestowed by each branch of the Wehrmacht (army, navy, and air force) and was issued for four years service (fourth class ‚Äì silver medal), 12 years (third class ‚Äì gold medal), 18 years (second class ‚Äì silver cross), 25 years (first class ‚Äì gold cross), and 40 years (special class). The 40 year special class was introduced on 10 March 1939. Recipients of the higher level awards wore the decoration simultaneously with one lower year award. The manner they were worn was: *3rd Class with 4th Class (gold medal with silver medal) *2nd Class with 4th Class (silver cross with silver medal) *1st Class with 3rd Class (gold cross with gold medal). The Long Service Award was retroactive throughout a service member's career, encompassing Reichswehr service as well as service dating during and before World War I. As such, there were a handful of 40 year awards presented, even though the Nazi era only lasted 12 years (1933-1945). The awards were worn on the left chest, immediately before the medals commemorating the annexation of Austria, Sudetenland and Memel. Design The awards were designed by Professor Dr Richard Klein. Apart from their finish, (gilt or silver), the third and fourth class medals have a common obverse. Both are 30mm in diameter and bear the German eagle clutching a swastika, surrounded by the words Treue Dienste in der Wehrmacht (Loyal service in the armed forces). The reverse shows the number of years of service, either '4' or '12', surrounded by a wreath. Likewise, the design of the first and second class crosses are similar. Both bear the German eagle on the obverse center, with the years of service, '18' or '25', on the reverse. The first class is gilt and 38mm wide ‚Äì the second silver and 35mm. The 40 year award is identical to the first class, with the addition of a gilt oakleaf cluster to the ribbon. Wehrmacht Long Service Awards were among Nazi era awards reauthorised for wear in 1957, re-designed to remove the now banned swastika symbol. Ribbons The medal used the cornflower blue ribbon of the pre-1918 . The recipient's arm of service was indicated by an emblem on the ribbon: a spread eagle and swastika for the army and Kriegsmarine, and a flying eagle and swastika for the Luftwaffe, the emblem corresponding in color with the metal of the award. {align=center class=wikitable width=100% !colspan=6 align=\\"center\\" Ribbon bar \\"Long Service Award of the Wehrmacht\\" - align=center !

Browning designed M1911. It was introduced in 1985 as a response from Colt to numerous aftermarket companies making smaller versions of the M1911 pistol. History In 1975, Rock Island Arsenal developed a compact M1911 pistol it called the \\"General Officer's Model Pistol\\" for issue to general officers of the US Army and Air Force, but the pistol was unavailable for sale to the general public. The following year, Pat Yates of Detonics had introduced his compact \\"Combat Master\\", a chopped down 1911, with 3.5\\" barrel and a shortened grip frame. Seeing the popularity of these compact pistols, other pistolsmiths began offering similar conversions on customers' 1911s. In 1985, Colt developed their own in-house version and named it the \\"Colt Officer's ACP\\", the following year they introduced a lighter version with an aluminium frame known as the Lightweight Officer's ACP which weighed 10 ounces less (24 ounces). The main differences from a full-sized M1911 are 6-round magazines not 7-round, 7 1/8\\" overall length not 8 1/2\\", 5 1/8\\" height not 5 1/2\\", 34-oz not 39-oz, and most characteristically 3 1/2\\" barrel not 5\\". A evaluation example tested by the Technical Staff of the National Rifle Association fired 300 rounds with few difficulties.American Rifleman, November 1984, pp. 53 and 54. They reported two failures to feed with wadcutters and one with hardball. Overall, the review is complimentary for its design cues and small size. When Colt introduced the 1991 line (a parkerized version of the 1911 with the series 80 firing pin safety), it included a pistol of the same dimensions as the Officer's ACP. That said, production examples failed to live up to the market's expectations. An inescapable characteristic of its compact size, the Colt Officer's ACP drew criticism for being finicky with ammunition and the sharp recoil from the short barrel. Firearms author, Frank James, writes that the decreased velocity from the shorter barrel causes performance of the round to be less than optimal, and a risk if used in a defensive situation. Reliability and accuracy has been improved through modifications such as replacing the stock barrel bushing with an aftermarket part and judiciously honing the hammer and sear. Beyond trigger work, more sophisticated modifications include replacing the stock hammer and sear with lightweight components, installing a high quality spring set and beveling the inside of the ejection port.

Its name derived from the shophouse, a common building type in urban Southeast Asia. The first ShopHouse opened in September 2011 in Washington, D.C. , there were a total of fourteen ShopHouse locations, in California, Chicago, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. ShopHouse was owned and operated by Chipotle Mexican Grill, and used a similar serving format. Like Chipotle, ShopHouse restaurants were company-owned, rather than franchised. Its competitors included Panda Express, P. F. Chang's, Pick Up Stix, and to a small extent Noodles & Company. On October 25, 2016, founder, Steve Ells, said during an earnings call that the company \\"decided not to invest further in growing the ShopHouse brand.\\" All ShopHouse locations were closed on March 17, 2017. After the restaurants closed, the leases for each restaurant were purchased by Gosh Enterprises and converted into new locations for Bibibop Asian Grill. Concept development The ShopHouse concept was primarily developed by Chipotle's director of concept development Tim Wildin, who was born in Bangkok and spent all of his childhood summers there. Wildin had been working in the marketing department at Chipotle and realized that if he could follow Chipotle‚Äôs business model and combine it with his knowledge of traditional Southeast Asian cuisine, he could bring the taste of his homeland to the American masses. Culinary manager Nate Appleman was responsible for developing some recipes and the procedures to produce the final product. Wildin was responsible with the look of the facilities, the locations of the restaurants, and marketing. History The first ShopHouse opened on Connecticut Avenue, in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Opened on September 15, 2011, the location was intended to test consumer response before further expansion. After almost two years, the second ShopHouse, the first on the West Coast, opened in Hollywood on June 17, 2013. Lunch bowl and fountain soda from ShopHouse In the last half of 2013, four new locations were quickly opened, two on each coast. A second D.C. location in Georgetown was opened in August. In October, a second Los Angeles-area location was opened in Santa Monica and also a location in Maryland opened in Bethesda on the other side of the country. At the end of 2013, a location in Westwood, Los Angeles was opened in December. Three D.C.-area locations were opened in 2014; in D.C. Chinatown in May; at The Mall in Columbia in the D.C. suburb of Columbia, Maryland, as part of that mall's expansion; and at Union Station in D.C. in November. After quite a bit of activity in 2014, a D.C.-area location in North Bethesda was opened in Maryland in March 2015 to make a total of 10 ShopHouse locations in the nation by the end of March 2015. The following year, a fourth location in Maryland was opened in Silver Spring in March 2016. In 2014, The Motley Fool noted that Chipotle was expanding the ShopHouse concept rather slowly when compared with the expansion of Noodles & Company during the same time period. A writer for MarketWatch commented in 2015 that some of the procedures that Chipotle had developed for providing affordable quality burritos quickly \\"may not work with other cuisines\\". , there had been on the average three new ShopHouses opened each year while there had been 150 new Chipotles opened annually during the same time period, or nearly three opens per week. ShopHouse defended their decision of having a relatively slow roll out by responding to their critics that they are still trying to shape the brand by getting everything done right before they duplicate the procedures and replicate it in a new location. In this way, they would like to provide great products in an efficient and cost effective manner that would entice customers to return frequently. It was announced in May 2015 that the first location in the Midwest was planned to be opened in the Chicago Loop during Fall 2015. A further announcement was later made in October stating that a location in Schaumburg, Illinois, is planned to be open in November with another location is planned to be open in downtown Chicago in December. Both Illinois locations opened on schedule with great reviews along with a few minor complaints. After a two years hiatus on the West Coast, a fourth Los Angeles area location was opened in July 2015 in El Segundo followed by a fifth L.A. location, the 15th in the nation, in July 2016 in West Hollywood. The West Hollywood location was the first case in which the restaurant shared a common wall, parking lot and outdoor patio with a Chipotle restaurant. On October 25, 2016, founder, Steve Ells, said during an earnings call that the company \\"decided not to invest further in growing the ShopHouse brand.\\" All ShopHouse locations were scheduled to close on March 17, 2017. Menu ShopHouse food was mostly inspired by Malaysian, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisine. Customers start with a base of chilled rice noodles, jasmine rice, brown rice, or salad and choose meat (or tofu), a vegetable, a sauce, a garnish, and a topping. The restaurant provided several suggested combinations. Some ShopHouse locations served Southeast Asian beer, such as Beerlao, Chang, and Singha. Initially, the restaurant served b√°nh m√¨ in addition to bowls, but the sandwiches were quickly dropped a few months later after receiving mostly negative reviews on the quality of bread that was being used and ShopHouse's inability to find a dependable supplier of decent bread. Unlike Chipotle, ShopHouse varied the ingredients available to their customers by adding seasonable vegetables to their menu that depended on local availability, such as kale, summer squash, butternut squash, parsnips, and collard greens. In 2014, ShopHouse began to offer their first dessert, a coconut rice and mango parfait. In 2016, the company began testing fried spring rolls at their West Hollywood location. Reception Tom Sietsema of The Washington Post called ShopHouse \\"one of the best fast food ideas in years.\\" The reviewer for Midtown Lunch said the food was not as sweet as overly sweet foods found in the heavily Americanized Asian chain restaurants, but closer to the authentic cuisines. The reviewer also said that the food is spicier than what one would expect from a chain, great for people who enjoy spicier foods (and a wall full of additional hot sauces for person who don't think the food is spicy enough) but not so great for people who want relatively bland foods. The downside to the concept is that the flavors could easily get \\"muddled\\" by selecting the wrong combinations of components. A food writer for Forbes Magazine who was born in Malaysia and specializes in writing about Asian cuisine, gave the chain a mixed review. Although she thought the individual components had great flavor, she believed that it is a big mistake for ShopHouse to allow the individual components to be mixed together in a single bowl and suggests that the food would taste better if components were kept separate, like in a bento. She wrote that \\"all those carefully crafted flavors were at the end muted and lost\\" and believed that the cause of the taste confusion is caused by \\"a lack of respect for national cuisines or even particular genres within national cuisines.\\" See also * List of defunct restaurants of the United States ReferencesExternal links * Category:2011 establishments in Washington, D.C.

The fable and its history The emblem of the gourd in the Lyon edition of Andrea Alciato's Emblemata (1550) The fable first appeared in the west in the Latin prose work Speculum Sapientiae (Mirror of wisdom),III.13 which groups its accounts into four themed sections. At one time attributed to the 4th century Cyril of Jerusalem, the work is now thought to be by the 13th century Boniohannes de Messana.According to notes in a Christies catalogue The story is told of a gourd that roots itself next to a palm tree and quickly equals her in height. The gourd then asks its sister her age and on learning that she is a hundred years old thinks itself better because of its rapid rise. Then the palm explains that slow and mature growth will endure while swift advancement is followed by as swift a decay. At the time it first appeared in Europe, the account was directed against the new rich in a feudal society which had yet to find a place for them. The Speculum Sapientiae was eventually translated into German under the title Das buch der Nat√ºrlichen wei√üheit by Ulrich von Pottenstein (c.1360-1417) and first printed in 1490. In 1564 a poetic version of the fable was included under its Latin title of Cucurbita et Palma in Hieronymus Osius' Fabulae Aesopi carmine elegiaco redditae and so entered the Aesopic tradition. In the 18th century it was adapted by August Gottlieb Meissner (1753-1807) and published with the work of other German fabulists in 1783.Der Kurbis und der Palmbaum, Fabel LIV, p.62 An anonymous translation later appeared in the New York Mirror10.38, 23 Mar 1833, p.299 in 1833 and a poetic version by Mrs Elizabeth Jessup Eames in the Southern Literary Messenger in 1841.Vol. 7.2, 1841 This new version of the fable ran as follows in its American prose translation: :A gourd wrapped itself round a lofty palm and in a few weeks climbed to its very top. :‚ÄòAnd how old mayest thou be?‚Äô asked the newcomer; ‚ÄòAbout a hundred years,‚Äô was the answer. :‚ÄòA hundred years and no taller? Only look, I have grown as tall as you in fewer days than you can count years.‚Äô :‚ÄòI know that well,‚Äô replied the palm; 'every summer of my life a gourd has climbed up round me, as proud as thou art, and as short-lived as thou wilt be.‚Äô The emblematic gourd During the vogue for Emblem books in the 16th-17th centuries, the gourd was taken as the symbol of evanescence and became associated with a new version of the fable in which a pine took the place of the palm-tree. Its first appearance was in the Latin poem by Andrea Alciato that accompanied what was to become Emblem 125 (on brief happiness) in his Emblemata.View online A translation of this runs: 'A gourd is said to have sprung up close to an airy pine tree, and to have grown apace with thick foliage: when it had embraced the pine's branches and even outstripped the top, it thought it was better than other trees. To it spoke the pine: Too brief this glory, for soon to come is that which will completely destroy you - winter!' One of the first of the English emblem writers, Geoffrey Whitney, borrowed Alciato's device for his own treatment of the theme of 'happiness that endures only for a moment' in his Choice of Emblemes, published in Leiden by Christopher Plantin in 1586 (p. 34).The facsimile reprint of 1886 is on Google Books It was accompanied by a 24-line poem, retelling the fable and reflecting upon it. Two of its four stanzas are given to the pine's reply when the gourd presumes to deride his host: ::To whome the Pine, with longe Experience wise, ::And ofte had seene suche peacockes loose theire plumes, ::Thus aunswere made, thow owght'st not to despise, ::My stocke at all, oh foole, thow much presumes. :::In coulde and heate, here longe hath bene my happe, :::Yet am I sounde and full of livelie sappe. ::But, when the froste and coulde shall thee assaie, ::Thowghe nowe alofte, thow bragge, and freshlie bloome, ::Yet, then thie roote shall rotte and fade awaie, ::And shortlie, none shall knowe where was thy roome: :::Thy fruicte and leaves, that nowe so highe aspire, :::The passers by shall treade within the mire. At the end of the following century this version of the fable reappeared in the section of fables by others in Roger L'Estrange's Fables of Aesop and Other Eminent Mythologists (1692).Fable 380 A different device accompanied Johann Ebermeier's treatment of the fable in his Neu poetisch Hoffnungs-G√§rtlein (new poetic pleasance of hope, T√ºbingen, 1653). It stands at the head of a short Latin poem with a longer German translation titled \\"Like a shadow and a gourd‚Äôs leaf is happiness\\".III.39, pp.451-2 Facsimile available online There was also a Latin prose version of the fable included in the Mithologica sacro- profana, seu florilegium fabularum (1666) by the Carmelite monk Father Irenaeus. There it illustrates the moral that prosperity is short and the story is told of either a pine or an olive tree (seu olae) next to which a gourd grows, only to die lamenting in winter.Fable 72, p.183 The adapted fable of \\"The Elm and the Vine, an illustration from Robert Dodsley's Select Fables of Esop, 1764 That the story was still known in England is suggested by Robert Dodsley's chance reference, that 'the gourd may reproach the pine' (the word Whitney used was 'deride'), in his essay on the fable genre,p.lxvi although he did not choose to include this one in his Select Fables of Esop and other fabulists. Instead he used an adaptation of The Elm and the Vine in the book's third section of 'original fables'. There a pert vine refuses an elm's proposal of marriage and boasts of being able to rely on its own resources. The elm replies to the 'poor infatuated shrub' that misapplication of its resources will soon bring about its downfall.Fable XXXI, pp.194-5 In the rewriting, the original moral of the Elm and the Vine, that weakness needs support, is made to revert to the economics of the Speculum Sapientiae. Very much the same moral is drawn from \\"The Oak and the Sycamore\\" in the same section of Dodsley's book: 'A Sycamore grew beside an Oak, and being not a little elevated by the first warm days of spring, began to shoot forth and to despise the naked Oak for insensibility and want of spirit. The Oak, conscious of his superior nature, made this philosophical reply. \\"Be not, my friend, so much delighted with the first precarious address of every fickle zephyr: consider, the frosts may yet return; and if thou covetest an equal share with me in all the glories of the rising year, do not afford to them an opportunity to nip thy beauties in the bud. As for myself, I only wait to see this genial warmth a little confirmed: and, whenever that is the case, I shall perhaps display a majesty that will not easily be shaken. But the tree that appears too forward to exult in the first favourable glance of spring, will ever be the readiest to droop beneath the frowns of winter.'Fable XLII, pp.210-11 Dodsley's conclusion is that 'He who is puffed up with the least gale of prosperity will as suddenly sink beneath the blasts of misfortune'. While the societal moral is the same, the oak's argument that 'one swallow does not make a summer' looks back to the emblematic story of the gourd and the pine tree. To confuse matters more, the same fable (the name of the tree apart) reappears as \\"The Oak and the Rose Tree\\" in John Trotter Brockett's Select Fables (Newcastle 1820), recycling one of Thomas Bewick's woodcuts.Available on Google Books Similar imagery is found in an anonymous Chan poem from China which involves a pine tree and unspecified flowers: :::Good deeds stand tall like a green pine, evil deeds bloom like flowers; :::The pine is not as brilliant as the flowers, it seems. :::When the frost comes, the pine will still stand tall, :::While the flowers, withered, can be seen no more.Quoted in Cloud and Water, Ven Master Hsing Yun, Hsi Lai University Press, Los Angeles CA, 2000, p.2 The pine is traditionally known as one of the 'Three Friends of Winter' in China. In the poem it is not the fact of the flower's rapid growth that makes the main contrast but the ability of the tree to withstand adverse conditions. However, in its comparison of outward show with inner virtue, the imagery is equally as emblematic as the European variant. A question of origin The first European recorder of the fable, Boniohannes de Messana, was from the Sicilian Crusader port now called Messina, so there is the possibility that the story reached there from the Eastern Mediterranean and is of West Asian origin. Two centuries earlier than Boniohannes, it appears in the poems of the 11th century Nasir Khusraw.There is a French version in Henri Mass√©'s Anthologie persane (XIe-XIXe si√®cles) Thereafter the image is often to be found in the work of other Persian poets. For example, Rumi's 13th century Persian classic, the Masnavi, employs it to picture the imitative person hasty for spiritual growth: :::You run up like a gourd higher than all plants, :::But where is your power of resistance or combat? :::You have leant on trees or on walls, :::And so mounted up like a gourd, O little dog rose; :::Even though your prop may be a lofty cypress, :::At last you are seen to be dry and hollow.Book 6 Story 4 of the Masnavi Later support for the oriental origin of the fable seems to be given by an American claim that a poem beginning \\"How old art thou? said the garrulous gourd\\" relates 'a Persian fable'. This was first made by Ella Rodman Church when she included it in an instructional work for children.Among the Trees at Elmridge, New York, 1886 Chapter 22, \\"The Palms\\" The same poem was later reprinted in Frances Jenkins Olcott's anthology of Story-Telling Poems (New York, 1913) with the same claim. Although there is ultimately some justice in this, as we have seen, the poem itself very obviously derives from Meissner's German fable and its original (and unacknowledged) Scottish author, Charles Mackay, nowhere credits it with an Eastern origin in the collection in which it first appeared.Interludes and Undertones, or, Music at Twilight (London 1884), poem 128, page 170 References Category:Fables Category:Emblem books Category:Fictional trees Category:Fictional plants ","title":"The Gourd and the Palm-tree"},{"id":"31590946","text":"Crime on the Hill is a 1933 British mystery film directed by Bernard Vorhaus and starring Sally Blane, Nigel Playfair and Lewis Casson.BFI.org The plot was based on a successful play by Jack de Leon and Jack Celestin.Richards p.189 It was made by British International Pictures at Welwyn Studios in autumn 1933.Richards p.188 Plot A man tries to clear the name of his uncle who is wrongly convicted of a murdering the squire in a picturesque English village.

John Grundy Jr. (1719‚Äì1783) was an English civil engineer, who worked on a number of drainage schemes, canal projects and dock works. He lived in Spalding, Lincolnshire, from 1739. Part of his legacy was his Report Books, seventeen volumes containing copies of his reports and other supporting documents from most of his projects, which in some cases are the only surviving records of major civil engineering projects. They were re-discovered in 1988. Life history John Grundy was the son of John Grundy, Sr. and Elizabeth Dalton. His father taught mathematics and was a land surveyor, who later became a civil engineer. John was born in the Leicestershire village of Congerstone, where he was baptised on 1 July 1719. The family moved to Spalding in south Lincolnshire in 1739, after his father became engineer for the drainage works at Deeping Fen. He joined the Gentlemen's Society in December 1739, and started work on his first known engineering project in the same year. This was for a sluice at Pinchbeck, where the Blue Gowt Drain joined the River Glen. His father probably supervised the project, and the two engineers worked on plans for improvements to the River Witham in 1743, which although they were not implemented at the time, formed the basis for subsequent work. He married Lydia Knipe in January 1743, and they had two daughters, Mary and Lydia, who survived into adulthood, and four other children who died as infants. His wife died in 1764, and he was married again in 1766, to Ann Maud, the widow of the vicar of St. Neots. He remained based in Spalding for the rest of his life, and died there on 15 June 1783. In his will (dated 15 January), he ensured that his widow was well provided for, and left ¬£1,000 to each of four grandchildren. He also bequeathed his books and manuscripts to Rev. J. G. Thompson, who was his eldest grandson and later became the vicar of the parish of Belton, near Grantham. Engineering works Grundy was involved with major projects at Grimsthorpe between 1746 and 1752 which included an earth dam to create an artificial lake, and returned there intermittently over the next 20 years. Between 1748 and 1764, he was employed as engineer for Deeping Fen, which included maintenance of the River Welland. During this time, he also took on consulting work and gained a good reputation for this. In 1762 he became the collector of the Land Tax in Spalding district, which although it only occupied him for a few weeks each year, earned him more money than his salary from Deeping Fen. He resigned the Deeping Fen position in 1764, but was retained as a consultant. His next projects included the Holderness drainage scheme, planning and supervision of the Louth Navigation which opened in 1770, the Adlingfleet drainage scheme, the Driffield Navigation, which also opened in 1770, the Laneham drainage scheme, and the Weighton drainage and navigation scheme, completed in 1775. He continued to act as consultant for Deeping Fen during this time, and also oversaw the construction of the first of the docks at Hull, the largest in England when it was completed in 1778. After 1775, he was much less active in the civil engineering field, although he continued to produce reports when asked. His biggest achievement in this period was the production of his Report Books, running to 12 volumes and 4,000 pages, with details of all his projects, except the works for Deeping Fen. Details The Act to authorise the Holderness Drainage scheme was passed at around the time that Grundy's wife of 21 years had died. He wrote a personal letter to his friend, the engineer John Smeaton, expressing his sadness. Less than two months later, both men visited the site on 4 July 1764, and produced a report ten days later. Later, Grundy sent the working drawings for the terminal sluice into the Humber to Smeaton, who made some suggestions and drew up a bill of materials. Grundy then acted as engineer for the project, which included of barrier bank to protect the land to the east of the River Hull from flooding by the river. John Hoggard oversaw the construction of the bank, while Joseph Page acted as resident engineer for the construction of the sluice and drains, and Charles Tate acted as land surveyor. Grundy made several visits to check progress, until the main drains and sluice were completed in October 1767, although work continued on the bank and minor drains until 1772, under Hoggard's supervision. The Laneham Drainage scheme covered an area of some between Laneham and West Burton in Nottinghamshire on the western bank of the River Trent. Grundy was approached in December 1768 by a group of landowners, and produced his first plans in February 1769. They included a catchwater drain running along the western edge of the region to route several streams to a sluice on the Trent, a floodbank to prevent inundation by the river, and a Mother Drain with side drains to route rainwater to another sluice. He then produced detailed plans, which formed the basis for an Act of Parliament, and stayed in London during March and April 1769 to ensure the bill was passed. He acted as engineer for the Drainage Commissioners who had been appointed by the Act, and the scheme was finished in May 1772, on time and at a cost of ¬£15,000. One change to the original scheme was his decision to add a drainage mill at Sturton, to lift water from the Mother Drain into the Trent. He made seven or more site visits during the course of the contract. Legacy When he died, Grundy left his report books and copies of all his subsequent reports to his grandson. They were bought by Sir Joseph Banks, who was president of the Royal Society, in 1793, and the loose reports were bound into a further five volumes. The Banks family retained the books until 1918, when they were sold at auction. Nothing more was heard of them until 1955, when volume 2 was obtained by the Institution of Civil Engineers from a book dealer in London. Subsequently, the remaining 16 volumes were discovered in the library at the University of Leeds, where they had been since 1930. Lord Brotherton had given them to the university as part of a large bequest, and they were found in 1988. In addition to Grundy's reports, the volumes contain carefully drawn diagrams and plans, together with copies of estimates, minutes of meetings, and other details of his schemes. Volume 2 covers his work at Grimsthorpe, volume 4 covers work on the River Dee and volumes 10 and 11 give the details of the Laneham drainage scheme. These volumes are particularly important because there are few other records of these projects.

It is governed by the Royal Belgian Cycling League since 1882, which became a founding member of the International Cycling Association in 1892 and later of the Union Cycliste Internationale in 1900. Since 2002, the Royal Belgian Cycling League is composed of the Wielerbond Vlaanderen (WBV), which governs the cycle racing in Flanders and of the F√©d√©ration Cycliste Wallonie-Bruxelles (FCWB), which governs the cycle racing in Wallonia and Brussels. Belgium has been one of the major countries in different categories of cycle racing over the years, including road cycling and cyclo-cross. The best Belgian cyclist of all times, Eddy Merckx, nicknamed the Cannibal, has won all of the 3 grand tours (5 Tour de France and Giro d'Italia wins as well as 1 Vuelta a Espa√±a win) and all of the 5 monuments of cycling. He also won the UCI Road World Championships 3 times and set the hour record, among other achievements. Road bicycle racing=Palmares At the Olympic Games, Belgium has won four gold medals for road cycling, with two victories for the men's team time trial (at the 1948 and 1952 Summer Olympics) and two in the individual race, for Andr√© Noyelle in 1952 and Greg Van Avermaet in 2016. The time trial team had previously won the silver medal at the 1924 Summer Olympics and the bronze at the 1936 Summer Olympics. Belgium has also collected the silver medal for the individual race competition in 1924 (Henri Hoevenaers) and in 1952 (Robert Grondelaers) and the bronze in 1948 (Lode Wouters), 1960 (Willy van den Berghen), 1964 (Walter Godefroot) and 2004 (Axel Merckx). Belgian cyclists have had more UCI Road World Championship gold medals (25) at the men's road race than any other country. Rik Van Steenbergen and Eddy Merckx have both won the title 3 times, and Georges Ronsse, Briek Schotte, Rik Van Looy and Freddy Maertens have all won twice. Women have won 6 gold medals at the women's road race event, with 4 for Yvonne Reynders. Other famous riders who won the title include Stan Ockers, Johan Museeuw and Tom Boonen. The first season-long competition in road cycling, the Challenge Desgrange-Colombo was introduced in 1948, and first won by Belgian rider Briek Schotte. Later in 1955, Stan Ockers became the second Belgian to win the competition. From 1956 to 1958, Fred de Bruyne won the trophy 3 times, and so equalled the record of Ferdinand K√ºbler. The next year, the challenge was replaced by the Super Prestige Pernod International. Starting in 1968, this competition was won by Belgians 10 times in a row, first by Herman Van Springel, then 7 consecutive times by Eddy Merckx and in 1976 and 1977 by Freddy Maertens. In 1989, the UCI Road World Cup started and was won twice by Johan Museeuw (1995 and 1996) and once by Andre√Ø Tchmil (1999). Since the competition was replaced by the UCI ProTour in 2005 and then by the UCI World Tour in 2009, Tom Boonen has reached the highest ranking with a second place in 2005 and Philippe Gilbert has been ranked third in 2010. Belgian cyclists have also performed very well in the 3 big tours. Ten cyclists have won the Tour de France, making of Belgium the second country with the most Tour de France wins (18) behind France. Besides Eddy Merckx (5 wins), Philippe Thys won the most prestigious tour 3 times (1913, 1914 and 1920) while Firmin Lambot (1919 and 1922) and Sylv√®re Maes (1936 and 1939) both won twice. The latest Belgian winner at the Tour de France however was Lucien Van Impe in 1976. Belgian cyclists have been more successful at winning the maillot vert for best sprinter, with 19 wins. Eddy Merckx and Freddy Maertens (3 wins) and Stan Ockers (2 wins) are the multiple winners in this classification. Tom Boonen won the shirt recently in 2007. The maillot √† pois for best climber was won 6 times by Lucien Van Impe, the last time in 1983, equalling the record of Federico Bahamontes, and twice by F√©licien Vervaecke and Eddy Merckx. In 2004 however, the record of 6 maillot √† pois wins was beaten by Richard Virenque. At the Giro d'Italia, Belgium has had 7 wins, being the second country most successful country after Italy (66 wins). Michel Pollentier and Johan De Muynck (the latest Belgian to have won the Giro in 1978) are with Eddy Merckx (5 wins) the 3 Belgian winners of this tour. Other achievements in this tour include 6 maglia verde of best climber (including 2 for Lucien Van Impe) and 5 maglia ciclamino for best sprinter (3 for Roger De Vlaeminck and 2 for Eddy Merckx). Belgium also has had 7 wins at the Vuelta a Espa√±a, with 2 wins by Gustaaf Deloor, the first winner of this tour in 1935 and 1936. The latest Belgian winner was Freddy Maertens in 1977. In the other classifications, Belgian cyclists have won 13 times the points classification, including Greg Van Avermaet in 2008 but never the mountains classification. Many Belgian cyclists have won one of the 5 monument cycle races. At the Tour of Flanders, Belgium counts 67 wins in 95 editions with 3 wins for Achiel Buysse, Eric Leman and Johan Museeuw. Roger De Vlaeminck holds the record of wins at Paris‚ÄìRoubaix (4), and Belgium is the most successful country in this race with 54 wins in 109 editions. Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge was won 59 times on 97 by Belgian cyclists. Eddy Merckx holds the record of the most individual wins (5). At the Giro di Lombardia, Belgium counts 12 titles in 104 editions, with only Italy performing better. Milan ‚Äì San Remo was won 7 times by Eddy Merckx, who holds the record of the most wins, and Belgium has won 20 times on 102, being the second most successful country after Italy in this race. In opposition to the big tours, which were not won anymore by Belgians since 1978, cyclists from Belgium are still being successful in the monument races. At Paris‚ÄìRoubaix, Johan Museeuw and Tom Boonen have won 3 times each since 1996, and Peter Van Petegem and Johan Van Summeren have also won the race once each. At the Tour of Flanders, Belgium has 11 wins since 1993, with 3 by Johan Museeuw, 2 by Peter Van Petegem, Tom Boonen and Stijn Devolder and 1 by Andre√Ø Tchmil and Nick Nuyens. In the other 3 monuments, Belgians has been less successful recently, with Andre√Ø Tchmil being the only Belgian winner of Milan ‚Äì San Remo in 1999 since Fons De Wolf in 1981. Philippe Gilbert has been the only winner of the Giro di Lombardia since Fons De Wolf in 1980, with wins in 2009 and 2010 and only 4 Belgians have won Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge since Joseph Bruy√®re in 1978: Eric Van Lancker in 1990, Dirk De Wolf in 1992, Frank Vandenbroucke in 1999 and Philippe Gilbert in 2011. Famous races Among the best-known road races, two out of the five monuments of cycling are held in Belgium: the Tour of Flanders and Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge. The Tour of Flanders is the final race of the Flemish Cycling Week, held in late March and early April, along with the Three Days of Bruges‚ÄìDe Panne, E3 Harelbeke, Gent‚ÄìWevelgem, Dwars door Vlaanderen. Meanwhile, the Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge and La Fl√®che Wallonne are part of the Ardennes classics, held in mid-April. The Omloop Het Nieuwsblad is the eighth Belgian classic race in the UCI World Tour. Other classic one day races in Belgium are Paris‚ÄìBrussels, Kuurne‚ÄìBrussels‚ÄìKuurne, Grand Prix de Wallonie. The best-known stage-races in Belgium are the Tour of Benelux, part of the UCI World Tour, and the Tour of Belgium, part of the UCI Europe Tour. The Belgian National Road Race Championships, Belgian National Time Trial Championships and Belgian National Cyclo-cross Championships determine which rider carries the Belgian flag for 12 months. Professional teams Belgium has currently two professional cycling teams performing in the UCI World Tour: Deceuninck- Quick-Step and Lotto-Soudal. Other categories In mountain bike, Filip Meirhaeghe has won the 2002 UCI Mountain Bike World Cup and the 2003 UCI Mountain Bike & Trials World Championships and was silver-medalist at the 2000 Summer Olympics. In mountain bike trials, Kenny Belaey has won the 26-inch wheel trial World Cup in 2002, 2005 and 2006. In cyclo-cross, Belgian competitors have gained 25 gold medals at the UCI Cyclo-cross Men World Championships since 1950 and 54 medals overall, making it the best country in cyclo-cross, ahead of France with 10 gold medals out of 34 medals. Eric De Vlaeminck has the most world title in cyclo-cross with 7 World Cup wins between 1966 and 1973. Other multiple Belgian world champions are Roland Liboton (4 titles), Mario De Clercq and Erwin Vervecken (3) and Bart Wellens (2). In track cycling, Matthew Gilmore and Etienne De Wilde won the gold medal of Men's Madison event at the 1998 UCI Track Cycling World Championships and the silver medal of Men's Madison at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Roger Ilegems won the gold medal of the Men's point race at the 1984 Summer Olympics while Patrick Sercu held several world records and won the gold medal of the Men's 1 km time trial at the 1964 Summer Olympics.

He is currently a member of All Progressive Congress (APC)https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/why-i-returned-to- apc-gemade.html/amp Early career Born on 4 September 1948 in Benue State, Gemade is a chief from the Tiv ethnic group. He holds a Tiv traditional title of Nom-I-Yange-I-Tiv. Gemade was the chief executive officer of the Benue Cement Company (BCC) from 1985 to 1992, and was said to have been highly effective in this position. Gemade was a member of the 1994‚Äì1995 Constitutional Conference during the military regime of General Sani Abacha. He has held the positions of Secretary (Minister) of Works and National Chairman of the Congress of National Consensus party, which was one of the parties sponsored by military director, General Sani Abacha. PDP chief In the first national convention of the PDP after the April 1999 general elections, Gemade was elected National chairman after a tough competition with one of the party founders, Chief Sunday Awoniyi. He succeeded Solomon Lar, the first chairman of the party, and was elected in part due to zoning rules which favoured giving the post to a northerner. Gemade initially had the solid backing of President Olusegun Obasanjo. However, before the 2001 National Convention held on 9‚Äì10 November, he was facing strong opposition from powerful interests in the party. When he tried to be elected chairman for a second term with Dr. Okwesilieze Nwodo as secretary, the two lost out to chief Audu Ogbeh who became chairman and Vincent Ogbulafor who became secretary. In the 2003 PDP presidential primaries, Gemade lost to former president Olusegun Obasanjo, who went on to be re-elected. In April 2003, he was expelled from the PDP on account of alleged anti-party activities. The main reason was that in the 2003 elections for Governor of Benue State he had supported the candidate of the United Nigeria Peoples Party (UNPP) rather than the PDP candidate, Chief George Akume. Later he was readmitted to the party and became a member of the Board of Trustees. In a January 2011 interview, he described the turbulence in the leadership of the PDP in the early years as healthy, showing competition between individuals rather than a power-sharing arrangement between the different groups. In a November 2010 interview, Gemade supported the decision to allow incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan to run for election, despite the fact that some felt zoning rules meant the candidature should go to a northerner. He disputed that Jonathan's candidature could lead to the breakup of the country, and noted as a member of a minority ethnic group in the north that the minority groups had always been strong supporters of national unity. Senator Gemade was a strong supporter of Joseph Akaagerger when he was elected Senator for Benue North East in 2007. In the April 2011 elections, he decided to challenge Akaagerger for the Senate seat. Several incidents occurred in Benue in run-up to the election, culminating in the shooting of General Lawrence Onoja. Gemade was among leaders questioned about the violence by the State Security Services in March 2011. Others questioned included George Akume, Iyorchia Ayu and Daniel Saror. In the 9 April 2011 elections for Senator of Benue North East, Gemade ran on the PDP platform and won 229,682 votes, beating Akaagerger who had moved to the Action Congress of Nigeria and obtained 143,978 votes.

The tunnel was dug from the outside. It was reported that at least 71 of the escapees were recaptured within days. Escape The tunnel used for the escape reportedly took several months to build, was over a hundred meters long, and used sophisticated techniques involving electricity, ventilation, and potentially the assistance of engineers. The tunnel ended in a house outside the prison that had been searched by security forces just two and a half months prior, yet with no suspicious activity reported. However, reports have speculated about whether it would have been possible to conduct the substantial earth- removal required for the construction of the tunnel without security forces having been aware. Outcome In the end, around 475 of the prisoners at the central jail managed to escape. At least 71 of the escaped prisoners were reportedly recaptured.https://tribune.com.pk/story/157744/recaptured-afghan- insurgents-tell-of-tunnel-escape/ Reports and commentary following the outbreak have focused on the extent that prison officials may have been complicit in the escape, and on whether the escaped prisoners can be expected to join in larger-scale attacks. Political assassinations in the Kandahar area are reportedly down in the last year, but suspicions about government officials, and their inability to protect civilians, has remained high. In response to the escape, the Afghan Uniformed Police established a checkpoint directly across the highway from the prison, directly above the tunnel exit. The security around the prison was also greatly enhanced by coalition and Afghan forces. Investigation The head of the team investigating the escape, Mohammed Tahir, further cemented the likelihood that there was complicity from a number of people. He described the tunnel as so carefully planned and sophisticated that it appeared that engineers must have been involved, not merely men with shovels. \\"The tunnel was dug in a very professional way,\\" said Tahir. \\"They have used an electrical system and a ventilation system and small shovels and pickaxes for digging and wheelbarrows for removing the soil.\\" Afghan Officials Try to Limit Damage From Prison Break, by Alissa J.

Hawk was formally fired by NJIT's President Altenkirch in 2010 for being: 1) \\"non-collegial\\" to faculty who missed their classes, 2) opposing the President's initiative to get students to pay for bringing NCAA to NJIT, 3) for Hawk developing close ties to Tsinghua University in Beijing, which the President had never heard of, 4)hiring a friend that was one of the world's leading researchers in entrepreneurship thus attracting $2 million for a Chair in NJ Entrepreneurship (Hawk refused to use that funding for athletics expansion on campus, so he was replaced with an acting dean who would (this was in Donald Trump style of management) 5) spending $415 on mini bar expenses in a Beijing Hotel, that turned out to be $30 and was for bottles of coke and Evian Water, not alcohol. (The NJIT legal team continues to argue that Evian is French Liquor, not water, and that \\"The Chinese currency is US Dollars, not Yuan, and everyone knows this.\\") Note: NJIT designed another 20 charges, like these, against Hawk. NJIT quietly \\"hired\\" a judge (New Jersey style legal processes?)at $500/hour for 18 months to aid in \\"objectively\\" finding Hawk guilty. The judge finally picked 1 of the 25 charges, one he had dismissed in humor previously, and continued to dismiss the 24 in humor. The judge was very nice and quite smart, but seemingly could not avoid the Faustian Dilemma posed by NJIT, who paid him from student tuition money to clear away any confusion about Hawk's guilt. This goes back to the widely known, historic thesis that 10% of humans are intelligent, and 80% of that 10% accept the immoral to access the immortal; e.g., as in leadership demonstrated later in Donald Trump's thinking. Hawk has continued to advise a number of foreign corporate leaders on US investments. One firm grew from $30 billion/year to $200 billion/year while Hawk advised them. Since 2008 his client base has stopped investing in the state of New Jersey. They helped pay for and closely watched the NJIT vs. Hawk case. Since then, there became a cloud website on the case as translated into Chinese and German. New Jersey's Attorney General later negotiated with Hawk to change the situation. His request was to change the NJIT Board of Trustees and then Leadership. That is now underway, slowly. Hawk knew Donald Trump from Atlantic City and NYC and had used him as a model businessman in classes. From this, he saw how how a growing number of white male students favored Donald's style, while female students rejected it. As such in 2015 Hawk initiated the Eternal Feminine Foundation in China. It grew to $700 million in assets, to support females with limited resources to attend premier colleges. Wealthy business owners, with daughters, continue to donate money to the objective of keeping men like Trump from leadership positions while also preparing the feminine to manage the consequences of a Trump.

Personal life  Zidaru took up fencing in 1967 at his school sports club, CSS Triumf, and later joined CSA Steaua Bucure»ôti. He first studied economics at the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies. He holds a Ph.D in sports science from the Faculty of Physical Education and Sports of the University of Bucharest.  Career  As a sportsman, he became national champion of Romania in 1975, and was vice-champion in 1978, 1980, and 1982. He also won eleven gold medal in the team championship for Steaua and the Cupa Rom√¢niei in 1982. He competed in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. He ranked only 26th in the individual √©p√©e event, but reached the semi-finals in the team event for Romania with Ioan Popa, Anton Pongratz, CosticƒÉ BƒÉrƒÉgan, and Petru Kuki. The team was eventually defeated by Russia and missed the podium. He was awarded in 1977 the title of master in sports (') and in 1982 the title of master emeritus in sports ('). After his retirement as a fencer he became a coach at CSA Steaua and trained amongst others Cornel Milan and the 1986 world silver medal Mikl√≥s Bodoczi. He is now an international coach for the International Fencing Federation, member of the executive committee of the European Fencing Confederation and technical director of the Romanian Fencing Federation. He takes an active part in the development of fencing worldwide, giving training courses in Jordania in 2004 and 2008, and supervising the Dakar international School for fencing masters from 2005 to 2008. He also held in 2012 the first fencing coaching course specifically dedicated to women. After Dan Podeanu's resignation following the London 2012 Summer Olympics, he became the coach of a largely reshuffled Romanian women's √©p√©e team: Loredana Dinu, Anca MƒÉroiu and Simona Gherman retired from sport; only captain Ana Maria Br√¢nzƒÉ remained from the twice-world champion team. Zidaru drafted Simona Pop and Maria Udrea as regular team members, with Raluca Sb√Ærcia and Amalia TƒÉtƒÉran as reserves. He led them to a silver medal in the 2013 European Fencing Championships in Zagreb and a bronze medal in the 2013 World Fencing Championships in Budapest. In August 2013 he won the Romanian veteran championship in the over 60 category. The 2013‚Äì14 season saw Simona Gherman's return to competition. She was drafted back into the team immediately and won a bronze medal at the European Championships in Strasbourg, Romania earning a sixth European title in the team event. The World Championships proved however very disappointing as no Romanian fencer got past the round of 16 and Romania lost in the quarter-finals, finishing 5th in the team event. Following this failure, Zidaru was replaced by Dan Podeanu. As of 2016, Zidaru is national coach to the Hong Kong women's √©p√©e team.

On 12 September 1998, he was arrested along with Myo Min Zaw for distributing fliers and organizing student demonstrations in Yangon.

Aye Aung and Myo Min Zaw were reportedly denied legal representation at their trial, which was held in Insein prison; Amnesty International also argued that the fairness of their trial was compromised by the press conference given by Burmese officials, in which they presumed the guilt of the two detainees. Both men were found guilty, and the court ordered that the sentences for each charge must be served cumulatively, rather than concurrently. As a result, Aye Aung was sentenced to a 59-year prison term, which he is currently serving in Kale prison in Burma's northwestern Sagaing Region; Myo Min Zaw was sentenced to 52 years. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners has alleged that conditions of Aye Aung's imprisonment are poor. In January 2005, his family reported that he was suffering from malaria, which was being worsened by prison officials denying him blankets in the winter. His mother stated that he was also suffering from gastric disease and severe back pain due to prison conditions.

The edifice is in the Gothic architectural style. It was classified as a monument historique of France on 7 August 1913. Its grand size made it the largest Gothic church in B√©arn in the 15th century. It is most famous for its heart of oak frame which represents the Medieval architecture style. History Heart of oak frame inside the church, representing Medieval architecture. It is now a tourist attraction Construction In the 16th century, Monein was a growing village with over 5,000 residents, or 850 fires; ( in official B√©arnese documents at the time), whereas in Pau there were only about 700 residents, as shown by the (census for taxation purposes) in B√©arn. The old Romanesque church Sant-P√©e (, equivalent to Saint-Pierre) became too small for the residents, so it was decided to build a larger church next to the Lay Abbey (which no longer exists). Monein was also a very rich village as it paid more taxes than Orthez and Oloron together, and it was one of the largest communes in B√©arn because it was composed of the villages of Cuqueron and Cardesse. Finally, the residents had religious life styles because there were 9 confraternities and 16 priests in Monein at the time. The size of the new church should be proportional to the wealth of the village; the √âglise Saint- Girons of Monein is over 61 m (200 ft) long, 16 m (52.5 ft) wide and 31 m (102 ft) high. It is larger than the two cathedrals of B√©arn, the Lescar Cathedral (Cath√©drale Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption de Lescar) in Lescar and the Oloron Cathedral (Cath√©drale Sainte-Marie d'Oloron) in Oloron-Sainte-Marie. Construction of the church began in 1464 and was completed in 1530. During the 70 years of construction, residents paid for the work through numerous taxes and built the church with their own hands. Others Queen Jeanne d'Albret of Navarre transformed the church into a Protestant church, however the church returned to Catholicism under the (Edict of Integration of B√©arn), promulgated by King Louis XIII of France (who was also Louis I of Navarre at that time). The church was then refurnished and it still retains a large Baroque-style altarpiece and 17th century organs from Toulouse today. The √âglise Saint- Girons was restored in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Its heart of oak frame is now a tourist attraction.

This selection of points contains a total of 2 corners, which are marked in green and blue, respectively. In mathematics, the corners theorem is a result in arithmetic combinatorics proved by Mikl√≥s Ajtai and Endre Szemer√©di. It states that for every \\\\varepsilon>0, for large enough N, any set of at least \\\\varepsilon N^2 points in the N\\\\times N grid {1,\\\\ldots,N}\\\\times{1,\\\\ldots,N} contains a corner, i.e., a triple of points of the form {(x,y), (x+h,y), (x,y+h)}. Later, gave a simpler proof, based on the triangle removal lemma. The corners theorem implies Roth's theorem.  Statement and proof of the corners theorem = Definition  A corner is a subset of \\\\mathbb{Z}^2 of the form {(x,y), (x+h,y), (x,y+h)}, where x,y,h\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} and h>0.  Formal statement of corners theorem  If A is a subset of the N\\\\times N grid {1,\\\\ldots,N}\\\\times{1,\\\\ldots,N} that contains no corner, then the size of A is o(N^2). In other words, for any \\\\varepsilon, there is a N_0 such that for any N\\\\geq N_0, any corner-free subset A of {1,\\\\ldots,N}\\\\times{1,\\\\ldots,N} is smaller than \\\\varepsilon N^2.  Proof  We would first like to replace the condition h>0 with h eq 0. To achieve this, we consider the setA+A\\\\subset {1,\\\\ldots,2N}\\\\times {1,\\\\ldots,2N}. By the pigeonhole principle, there exists a point c\\\\in A+A such that it can be represented as c=a+b for at least \\\\frac{A^2}{(2N)^2} pairs a,b\\\\in A. We choose this point c and construct a new set A':=A \\\\cap (c-A). Observe that A'\\\\ge \\\\frac{A^2}{(2N)^2}, as the size of A' is the number of ways of writing c=a+b. Further observe that it suffices to show that A' = o(N^2). Note that A' is a subset of A, so it has no corner, i.e., no subset of the form {(x,y), (x+h,y), (x,y+h)} for h>0. But A' is also a subset of c-A, so it also has no anticorner, i.e., no subset of the form {(x,y), (x+h,y), (x,y+h)} with h<0. Hence, A' has no subset of the form {(x,y), (x+h,y), (x,y+h)} for h e 0, which is the condition we sought. To show A'= o(N^2), we construct an auxiliary tripartite graph G. The first part has vertex set U={u_1,\\\\ldots,u_N}, where the vertices correspond to the N vertical lines x=i. The second part has vertex set V={v_1,\\\\ldots,v_N}, where the vertices correspond to the N horizontal lines y=j. The third part has vertex set W={w_1,\\\\ldots,w_{2N}},, where the vertices correspond to the 2N slanted lines y=-x+k with slope -1. We draw an edge between two vertices if the corresponding lines intersect at a point in A'. Let us now think about the triangles in the auxiliary graph G. Note that for each point x\\\\in A', the vertices of G corresponding to the horizontal, vertical, and slanted lines passing through x form a triangle in G. A case check reveals that if G contained any other triangle, then there would be a corner or anticorner, so G does not contain any other triangle. With this characterization of all the triangles in G, observe that each edge of G (corresponding to an intersection of lines at some point x\\\\in A') is contained in exactly one triangle (namely the triangle with vertices corresponding to the three lines passing through x\\\\in A'). It is a well-known corollary of the triangle removal lemma that a graph on n vertices in which each edge is in a unique triangle has o(n^2) edges. Hence, G has o(N^2) edges. But note that we can count the edges of G exactly by just counting all the intersections at points in A' ‚Äì there are 3A' such intersections. Hence, 3A'=E(G)=o(N^2), from which A'=o(N^2). This completes the proof.  A proof of Roth's theorem from the corners theorem  Roth's theorem is the special case of Szemer√©di's theorem for arithmetic progressions of length 3. > Roth's theorem. If A\\\\subseteq{1,2,\\\\ldots, N} contains no 3-term > arithmetic progression, then A=o(N)  The proof  We have A\\\\subseteq{1,2,\\\\ldots, N} that does not contain any 3-term arithmetic progression. Define the following set > B={(x,y)\\\\in {1,2,\\\\ldots, 2N}\\\\times {1,2,\\\\ldots, 2N}x-y\\\\in A}. For each a\\\\in A, there are at least N pairs (x,y)\\\\in {1,2,\\\\ldots, 2N}\\\\times {1,2,\\\\ldots, 2N} such that x-y=a. For different a_1, a_2\\\\in A, these corresponding pairs are clearly different. Hence, B\\\\geq NA. Say for a contradiction that B contains a corner {(x,y), (x+h,y), (x,y+h)}. Then A contains the elements x-(y+h), x-y, (x+h)-y, which form a 3-term arithmetic progression ‚àí a contradiction. Hence, B is corner-free, so by the corners theorem, B=o(N^2). Putting everything together, we have A\\\\leq B/N=o(N^2)/N=o(N), which is what we set out to prove. References * * External links *Proof of the corners theorem on polymath.

It located near the mouth of Kori Creek, in the west of Kutch district of Gujarat, India. In past, the temple was almost entirely cut off from the mainland by tidal creeks but now is connected by road. Koteshwar Shiva is said to be the Bhairava of Hinglaj Mata residing at Hinglaj. The virtuous devotees are therefore recommended to visit Koteshwar after they have visited Hinglaj Mata. Etymology Koteshwar literally means \\"ten million gods\\". History The earliest mention of the place can be found in writings of Chinese traveler Hiuen-Tsiang. Hiuen-Tsiang mentioned it as \\"Kie-tsi-shi-fa-lo situated on the western border of the country close to the river Indus and to the great ocean\\" of Kutch. According to Hieu-en-Tsiang, Koteshwar port was five miles in boundary near the mouth of the river Indus. There were 80 monasteries with about 5000 monks in them chiefly from the school of Sammityas. In the middle of the completion were thirteen temples of which Mahesh Mandir was full of good monument and where ash-smeared heretics lived. Except some temples, Koteshwar shows few signs of its former greatness. Legend The story of Koteshwar begins with Ravana, who won it as a boon from Lord Shiva for an outstanding display of piety, this Shiva linga of great spiritual power. But which Ravana, in his arrogant haste, accidentally dropped and it fell to earth at Koteshwar. To punish Ravana for his carelessness, the linga turned into a thousand identical ones, some versions of the story say ten thousand, some a million. Unable to distinguish the original, Ravana grabbed one and departed, leaving the original one here, around which Koteshwar Temple was built. The temple is also known as Kotilingeshwar Temple. Places of interest Koteshwar Mahadev Temple Koteshwar Mahadev Temple The temples, on a sandstone mound about a mile to the north-west of the village, rising boldy from the sea that washes their western face, are enclosed by a fortified wall, the gate approached by three flights of steps. A writing on the left side of the gate shows that the present fort and temples were built in 1820 (Samvat 1877) by two Seths, Sundarji and Jetha Shivji, Brahma-Kshatris by caste. The courtyard is surrounded by a battlemented wall armed formerly with three small guns. In the middle, on a platform 4 feet high 63 long and 49 broad, is a handsomely built stone temple of Mahadev. The porch has three domes with, under the central dome, a large and beautiful brass bull presented by Rao Deshalji I of Cutch State; in the right dome a large statue of Hanuman and in tho left dome one of Ganpati. Inside tho porch is the hall, mandap, 19 feet 9 inches long and 24 feet 8 inches wide, with a large central and two side domes. On a marble tablet, let into the centre of the hall floor, the names of Kshatri Jetha and Sundarji Shivji are humbly cut that the feet of the worshippers may tread on them. At the inner end of the hall and between it and the shrine are, on either side, figures of Ganpati and Hanuman. In the screen wall of the shrine are two inscriptions referring to the rebuilding of the temple in 1820. The frame of the door is of carved stone. The door itself, 2 feet wide and 12 high, is plated with carved silver. The shrine, paved with black marble, is 11 feet square. In the back wall is an image of Parvati, and in tho west wall are two images of Ganpati and Revaji. In the centre of a basin, jaladhari, rather far back in the shrine, is a four feet high ling of the kind called self-born, svayambhu. In the point of the ling are some iron nails driven into it, according to the local story, by Alauddin Khalji in 13th century. Gujarat‚ÄìDaman‚ÄìDiu: A Travel Guide By Ward. On the site of this modern temple there stood an older building, one of whose stones is said to have borne an inscription to the effect that it was built by the Kers of Golay. This stone has disappeared, but among the Kers, who are now a Muslim clan, the story that their forefathers built the temple still remains. At the time of rebuilding the temple in 1820, the foundation of the east wall was kept and it was enlarged on the west. The change so altered the position of the ling that it was no longer under the central lotus. This was said to be ominous to the ruler, and in 1863 (Samvat 1920) Rao Pragmalji I of Cutch State, when he visited the temple, ordered a silver canopy to be placed over the ling. By the Rao's death the work was stayed before the plans were finished. In ancient times the temple priest was a devotee of the ear-slitting or Kanphati sect. But for sixteen successions the office has been in the hands of Shaiv Atits. In the past, the yearly revenue from lands granted by the Rao and others, one of whom is said to have been a Muslim, is about ¬£791 (30,000 Kutch koris). The temples have been rehabilitated and renovated over many centuries by various rulers of Kutch, renovation done by local Kutchi artisans.Shree Kutch Gurjar Kshatriya Samaj : A brief History & Glory of our fore-fathers : Page :26 From this point, the glow of light from Karachi, Pakistan can be seen in a clear night.

He is said to have moved to the present spot in the fifteenth century, when the Brahmachari of Narayan Sarovar established his power. Close to the chief Koteshvar Mahadev temple, is a smaller temple, built by the same men and about the same time in honour of Kalyaneshvar. From the fort a paved causeway, twelve feet broad and used as a pier by country craft, runs out for 520 feet. At the end is a square reservoir filled by every high tide, where Hindus perform the shraddh ceremony and bathe. On the middle of the pier is a square platform, kotha, on which is built the temple of Nilkanth, now known as Saraneshvar, facing the west with a porch and a small Islamic dome. It is said to have been originally built in the thirteenth century by God Rani who had come to marry Ra Kanoj, but some difference arising, she went to Sindh and married Lakha Ghurara. It was rebuilt by Mahakunvar, wife of Desalji I (1718 - 1741), and repaired by Kshatri Jetha and Sundarji Shivji. It was again, in 1857, repaired by Gosai Dolatgarji Revagar Kunvargar at a cost of about ¬£200 (7800 koris). Ra Kanoj tomb Across the Kori from Koteshwar, about nine miles to the north-west, is the tomb of Ra Kanoj built in 1773 (Samvat 1830), twenty feet long by sixteen broad and twenty -eight high, with one large central and four corner domes, Ra Kanoj is said to be the son of the daughter of Ra Bhalot, chief of Ujjain, who, about the end of the ninth century, in a fight with a Muslim army, was killed at Sekot a small fort half a mile north-east of Narayan Sarovar. The priests of the shrine used to be sailors of the Bhadala caste, now they are Jats. Connectivity It is 178 km from Bhuj, district headquarters of Kutch and only 4 km from Narayan Sarovar, another ancient Hindu pilgrimage site.

Highly admired by its contemporaries, the work inspired other paintings such as Fra Bartolomeo's Piet√† and Andrea del Sarto's Luco Piet√†, both in the same collection. Detail of Joseph of Arimatea. During the Napoleonic invasion of Italy, it was transferred to Paris (1799), where it remained until 1814. Initially housed at the Gallerie dell'Accademia, it was moved to Palazzo Pitti in 1834. Description The work is emblematic of Perugino's style, due to the presence of numerous figures and attitudes, creating a calm scene of contemplation, in order to ease a religious contemplation without renouncing to a sense of harmony and beauty. Over a hilly background with a lake and a fortified city, is the scene of the Lamentation, which occupies the foreground of lower half of the painting. The body of Jesus is at the center, lying over a white shroud and held by one of the Pious Women, by Nicodemus and by Joseph of Arimathea. The latter dons a richly decorated hat with flowers. The Virgin is holding one of Jesus's arms, looking at him pathetically.

It was opened as a school for orphaned boys. On September 16, 1897, a procession from Moscow and St. Petersburg delivered five holy icons. On November 16, 1897, the wooden church burnt down. Construction on the new two-story stone church began in June 1902, but it was only opened in 1917. Tragic events came to the monastery in 1918, as on August 12 of that year, the Bolsheviks tortured and threw the monastery's Archimandrite Varlaam into the Kama River. From August 1918 to January 1919, the Bolsheviks executed and tortured 34 monks from the monastery. In March 1923, the monastery was completely closed down. During Soviet times, the monastery was used as a nursing home for invalids. Reconstruction of the monastery began in the late 1980s.

The capital is Paga. The district was created in 2008.  1.1 Background  The Kassena-Nankana West District is one of the thirteen districts in the Upper East Region of Ghana. It was carved out of the Kassena Nankana Municipal in 2007 and inaugurated on Friday, 29 February 2008. The Local Government Instrument which established the district is Legislative Instrument (L.I) 1855. The paramount aim of creating this Assembly was to bring the business of governance to the doorsteps of the ordinary Ghanaian. It is located approximately between latitude 10.97¬∞ North and longitude 01.10¬∞ West. The district has a total land area of approximately 1,004 sq. km. The Kassena-Nankana West District shares boundaries with Burkina Faso to the north, Bongo District to the north-east, Bolgatanga Municipal to east, Kassena Nankana Municipal to the south, Bulsa District south-west and Sissala East District to the west.  1.2 Physical Features = 1.2.1 Relief and drainage  The district is underlain mainly by Birrimian and Granitic rock formation. The relief of the district is generally low lying and undulating with isolated hills rising up to 300 meters above sea level in the western part of the district. Notably among these hills are Fie (9280 metres above sea level), Busono 350 metres, and Zambao 360 metres. The district is mainly drained by the Sissili River and its tributaries. There are however some few dug-outs and ponds which are used for livestock rearing, crop production and domestic purposes.  1.2.2 Climate  The Kassena-Nankana West District falls within the interior continental climatic zone of the country characterized by pronounced dry and wet seasons. The two seasons are influenced by two air masses. First is the warm, dusty and dry harmattan air mass which blows in the north easterly direction across the whole district from the Sahara desert. During its period of influence (late November ‚Äì early March) rainfall is entirely absent, vapour pressure is very low (less than 10mb) and relative humidity rarely exceeds 20.0% during the day but may rise to 60.0% during the nights and early mornings. Temperatures are usually modest at this time of the year by tropical standards (26¬∞C ‚Äì 28¬∞C). May to October is the wet season. During this period, the whole of West African sub-region including Kassena-Nankana West District is under the influence of a deep tropical maritime air mass. This air mass together with rising convention currents provides the district with rains. The total rainfall averages 950 mm per annum. The above phenomenon adversely affects the water table and reduces underground water. Water harvesting is probably a viable option in the district. 2 Figure 1.1: Map of Kassena Nankana West District Source: Ghana Statistical Service, 2010 Population and Housing Census  1.2.3 Vegetation  The vegetation is mainly of Sahel Savannah type consisting of open savannah with fire swept grassland separating deciduous trees among which may be seen a few broad-leafed and fireleached tree species. Some of the most densely vegetated parts of this district can be found along river basins and forest reserves. Examples are the Sissili and Asibelika basins. Most of these trees in the forested areas shed their leaves during the dry season. The human activities over the years have also affected the original vegetation considerably. Common trees which are also of economic importance include Dawadawa, Sheanut, Baobab, Nim and Mango. The low vegetation cover of the area hampers sufficient rainfall thereby reducing underground water supply.  1.2.4 Soil  Two main soil types can be found in the district. These soil types are the Savannah Ochrosols and the ground water laterite. The northern and eastern parts of the district are covered by the Savannah Ochrosols, while the rest of the district is characterized by ground water laterite. The Savannah Ochrosols are porous, well drained, loamy, mild acidity and interspersed with patches of black or dark grey clay soils. This soil type is suitable for cultivation of cereals and legumes. The ground water laterites are developed over shale and granite. Due to the underlying rock type, they become water logged during the rainy season and dry up during the dry season, thus causing cemented layers of iron-stone which make cultivation difficult. This would probably have contributed significantly to food insecurity in the district.  1.3 Political Administration  The Assembly has a total membership of 68 people made up of 46 elected members, 20 appointed members, the ex-officio members being the 1 Member of Parliament and the District Chief Executive. The present Assembly has ten (10) female members, four of whom are elected and 6 appointed. There are 11 Area Councils in the district which include the Chiana Town Council, Mirigu, Sirigu, Kandiga, Kayoro, Katiu, Nakong, Batiu, Paga, Nabango and Kejelo Area Councils. Administrative set up Administratively, the district is divided into 3 zones namely the North, East and West Zones. The District Assembly has the following departments in place and functioning under the District Co-ordinating Director. The District Directorate of Health Service, The Ghana Education Service (GES), Department of Community Development, Birth and Deaths Registry, District Environmental Health Unit, Department of Agriculture. The following national agencies which do not form part of the Departments of the Assembly are also in place: The National Service Secretariat, The NCCE, The Immigration Service, The CEPS, The Police Service. The other key decentralized departments which are yet to be established in the District include the following: Department of Town and Country Planning, Information Service Department, Department of Parks and Gardens. Other important national agencies that are crucial but not yet established in the district are: The Fire Service, The Statistical Service Department, Survey Department, The Forestry Commission, Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ), The Land Valuation Board 4 Committees of the assembly The following committees have been constituted and are operational as part of the political and administrative machinery of the district. The Executive Committee (which is supported by the following sub-committees): Finance and Administration, Works, Justice and Security, Development Planning, Health and Environment, Education, Agriculture, Women and Children. The other committees in the district are: District HIV/AIDS Committee, District Security Council, District Tender Committee, District Tender Review Board, Audit Report Implementation Committee, and District Budget Committee.  1.4 Social and cultural structure = 1.4.1 Traditional set-up  There are seven paramountcies in the Kassena Nankana West District, namely, Paga, Chiana, Katiu, Nakong, Kayoro, Mirigu, and Sirigu. Every paramountcy has at leastone ‚ÄòTindana‚Äô who acts as the chief priest and relates with the ancestral traditions which he holds in trust for the people. Sirigu has six Tindana. Matters concerning chieftaincy, culture, and tradition are handled by the various traditional council‚Äôs and the individual chiefs.  1.4.2 Ethnicity  The predominant tribes in the district are the Kassena and the Nankana and Mamprusis. Minor ethnic groups include Kantosi, Moshie, Builsa, Zambrama and few migrant workers from Burkina-Faso. These tribes have co-existed over the years, enhancing the development of the district. Despite the varied ethnic composition of the district, the society is generally patrilineal and traditionally male- dominated. Women are generally less involved in decision making and are traditionally responsible for the bulk of household activities such as cooking, fetching of water and caring for the children as well as other farming activities such as planting, weeding, harvesting and are also more involved in other commercial activities such as buying and selling.  1.4.3 Religious composition  The major religious denominations are Christians, Muslims, and Traditionalist. The traditionalists are mostly found in the rural parts of the district. Their spiritual roles contribute to enhancing peace and development in the district.  1.4.4 Festivals  Festivals are significant practices in the district. The Fao Festival is the predominant in Paga Traditional Area. This festival is celebrated to thank the gods for a bumper harvest. Another post-harvest festival is Gakwea which is also celebrated to give reverence and thanks to the gods for a bumper harvest which has implication for food security in the district. The Keposiga and Mokeeka festivals are also celebrated by the people of Sirigu and Kandiga. The festivals celebrated in the district strengthen the traditional family unions and systems of the people.  1.4.5 Marriage  The traditional marriage system entails a distinctive practice or payment of bride price, a system where the family of the bridegroom meets some marriage expenses including cola nuts, tobacco and guinea fowls. The bridegroom apart from the above items pays seven sheep and a cow. In the event of the bridegroom‚Äôs inability to pay the initial sheep and cow, the children would be mandated to settle their father‚Äôs indebtedness before they can dowry their wives. The above arrangement ensures strengthened ties between families and ensures security of marriages.  1.4.6 Inheritance  The patrilineal system of inheritance is practised. The eldest son inherits the deceased father in trust of the family. There is no form of ownership of family assets by daughters within the traditional system. Inheritance in the district invariably denies women access to productive resources including land.  1.4.7 Funerals  Funerals have become expensive in the way they are performed these days in the district due to show of real wealth and competition. The practice of funeral rites and other associated customary practices is another emerging issue affecting the welfare of the living standards of several families and individuals. The performance of funerals has of late been quite a source of worry and economic hardships to several families. Funerals are mostly organized after the harvest.  1.4.8 Land title and ownership  Individuals do not own lands but rather the family heads take care of the land on behalf of members. The chiefs oversee the distribution and sale of land. The Tidanas/Tigatus are the original owners of the land; however they transfer land to other family heads.  1.5 Economy = 1.5.1 Agriculture  Agriculture is the dominant economic activity in the district. The sector employs over 68.7% of the people. Male farmers‚Äô population stands at 33,307 (48.4%) and female farmers 35,509 (51.6%). The major crops grown are millet, sorghum, rice, groundnuts, leafy vegetables, cowpea, bambara beans, okro, cotton, tomatoes and onion. Livestock reared in the district include cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, guinea fowls, fowls and other domestic animals like donkeys. Fish farming involving Tilapia and Mudfish is quite significant. Farm sizes are quite small and yields are very low as compared to other parts of the country due in part to poor soils and unreliable rainfall. There are few dams and dugouts which are being used for dry season farming. This has implications for food insecurity.  1.5.2 Commerce  Trading and commercial activities in the district revolve mainly around foodstuff, semiprocessed food, crafts and livestock These commodities are sold in the local markets and outside the district. Markets have 3-day except Chiana aht has a 6-day market cycles. Markets play a very important role in the local economy. Commodities traded in range from foodstuffs and livestock to manufactured goods. The main markets are Chiana, Paga, Sirigu, Kandiga, Mirigu, Katiu, Nakong and Kayoro.  1.5.3 Manufacturing  The Kassena-Nankana West District has no large scale manufacturing industries. It is characterized by small scale food processing, craft and manufacturing industries. Examples include smock weaving, pottery and blacksmithing.  1.5.4 Agro industry/processing  Processing of foodstuff, cash crops and goods are common features of the local economy. The major small scale industrial activities include sheabutter extraction, pito brewing, milling or grinding of millet for domestic use, dawadawa processing, weaving and dressmaking, pottery, rice milling and soap making.

The sector is dominated by females who need to be organized into groups and their capacities built to enhance their businesses. There are also varied business types in the district which need to be developed in order to boost the local economy.  1.5.5 Banking and financial services  The district has one banking institution, the Naara Rural Bank Limited located in Paga with branches at Navrongo, Chiana and Sirigu. There are also non-banking institutions in the district which collaborate with the financial institutions to offer credit to groups and individuals. Such institutions include Non-governmental Organizations, Community Based Rural Development Project and National Board for Small Scale Industries. In addition, nonformal credit arrangements such as \\"Susu\\" are available for traders and small-scale producers.  1.5.6 Hospitality industry  The following are a list of hospitality facilities which complement the tourist industry in the district. They include Kubs lodge, the CEPS Canteen, Black heritage, More Hope Enterprise and several other pito bars. However, most of these facilities need to be developed in order to attract more users which would in turn boost the private sector in the district.  1.5.7 Unemployment and underemployment  The level of unemployment is very high in the district especially among the youth. Agriculture pursuits dominate the employment scene. Over 70.0 percent of the active 7 population is into agriculture and the unemployment situation is worse during the prolonged dry season when no farming activity can take place. Dry season gardening is practised only in communities where there are small- scale dams. This invariably compels most of the youth to migrate to the southern part of the country in search of jobs. Other areas that offer employment opportunities to the people include the public services, retail trade, food processing, pottery and other agro-based processing. The above characteristics do affect the growth and expansion of the district‚Äôs economy.  1.5.8 Tourism  There are quite a large number of tourist attractions in the district including the Paga Sacred Crocodile Ponds, the Zenga Pond, Pikworo Slave camp, a Pottery Art Centre at Sirigu which are operational. The other tourist sites such as the Caves at Chiana, the sacred pythons at Kayoro, and the remains of the Catholic Church at Kayoro need to be developed. There is therefore the need for the district assembly to attract investors into the tourism area of the district.

In the 16th century it was moved to the church St. Francis in the same city but, after the Napoleonic invasion of Italy, it was moved to Milan, being housed at Brera since 1811. Description The painting feature a mainly vertical architectural setting, under which a high octagonal podium with the Virgin's throne. The base is decorated by tiles (with the Massacre of the Innocents, Adoration of the Magi and the Presentation in the Temple) which simulated antique bas-reliefs and were inspired by the altar of the basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua by Donatello. The base supports columns with mouldings and decorations of garlands, dishes and marble rings, while in the background is a stormy sea. The latter is a reference to the legendary foundation of Santa Maria in Porto, when the Crusader Pietro degli Onesti, after escaping a shipwreck, made a vow to entitle a church to the Virgin Mary in exchange for his miraculous salvation. The throne is enclosed in a niche with reliefs, and stands on a carpet. At the sides are red curtains.

(1975). Identifying with television characters. Journal of Communication, 25, 51‚Äì55. wishful identification is the extension of identification, which refers to people‚Äôs desire to become or to act in the same way as a certain media character. The majority of research about wishful identification has focused on its impacts on media users‚Äô intimate relationships with, attachment to, identification with, imitation of, or interaction with media figures. From this perspective, research into effects of wishful identification are helpful to understand how mediated messages can be effectively conveyed, and how mediated behaviors and figures can be shaped to positively influence social attitudes and behaviors. Participants in relevant research primarily consist of children and adolescents, as they do not have significant life and social experience (Bandura, 1977; Hoffner, 1996Hoffner, C. (1996). Children‚Äôs wishful identification and parasocial interaction with favorite television characters. Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 40, 389‚Äì402.). They have greater needs than adults for role models so that they as children may develop and adjust their own social behaviors. As mentioned by Comstock (1993),Comstock, G. (1993). The medium and the society: The role of television in American life. In G. L. Berry, & J. K. Asamen (Eds.), children and television: Images in a changing sociocultural world (pp. 117-131). Newbury Park, CA: Sage. ‚Äútelevision is a catalogue of modes of behavior; whether they affect what viewers do depends on their being taken as rewarding, acceptable, and applicable‚Äù (p. 128). Wishful Identification & Identification There has been some inconsistency in the definition of identification. Some researchers define identification as hoping to be a certain media figure, to be in a certain mediated situation of that media figure, or to act a similar way to that media figure. However, this definition is not applied as widely as the one introduced by Cohen (2001):Cohen, J. (2001). Defining identification: A theoretical look at identification of audiences with media characters. Mass Communication & Society, 4, 245-264. ‚Äúa mechanism through which audience members experience reception and interpretation of the text from the inside, as if the events were happening to them.‚Äù While identification is characterized as sharing media figures‚Äô points of view, vicarious participation, and imaginability, wishful identification focuses on media users‚Äô desire and tendency. Wishful Identification & Perceived Similarity Perceived similarity is found to be a significant predictor of wishful identification (Hoffner & Cantor, 1991).Hoffner, C., & Cantor, J. (1991). Perceiving and responding to mass media characters. In J. Bryant & D. Zillmann (Eds.), Responding to the screen: Reception and reaction processes (pp. 63‚Äì101). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. Perceived similarity can predict not only media users‚Äô desire to be a certain media character, but also the level of that desire. Wishful Identification & Imitation In early research and some recent research, imitation is an interchangeable word for wishful identification. Hoffner (1996) defines imitation as a ‚Äúdesire to be like or behave in ways similar to a character‚Äù (p. 19). The limitation of this conceptualization, however, is apparent. The essence of wishful identification is media users‚Äô desire, but imitation is not about people‚Äôs expectations; rather, it is about modeling, either for identity or for behavior. While wishful identification implies anything but an actual emulating action, the best nature of imitation is action.

On 22 November 2000 the Wartturm was the scene of one of the most spectacular rockfalls for decades in Saxon Switzerland. About a third of the rock broke off and some 450 m¬≥ of sandstone with an estimated weight of 800 tonnes crashed over 60 to 75 m into the valley.http://www.1999er.gipfelbuch.de/page181.htm It was the largest quantity of falling rock since a slide in 1961 on the Bienenkorb, which did not fall from such a great height.http://rcswww.urz.tu- dresden.de/~sgerber/gerber/felssturz.htm#daten The cause was suspected to be progressive weathering of a fissure running through the rock.

Early years Kim was born in Seoul, South Korea. She tried a number of hobbies while young, including Taekwondo and piano. She developed an interest in ballet and began taking ballet classes when she was ten years old. Dancing career In 1991, when Kim was thirteen years old, she began training professionally at the Yewon School, a specialist arts junior school in Seoul. During vacation she attended season sessions for ballet in New York City. Later the same year, she had a chance to train with professors of the Vaganova Academy and Kim decided to study at the Vaganova. In 1992, Kim went to Russia and she passed the entrance exam for the school. Kim entered the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet. In 1996, Kim performed in Vaganova's graduation performance. While she planned to join the company in Russia after her graduation, Kim withdrew her plans and returned to Seoul when her mother died suddenly from a heart attack during Kim's graduation performance. Five months later, Kim joined the Korea National Ballet (KNB) as the youngest principal dancer. She made her stage debut, dancing the role of Esmeralda in Notre Dame de Paris. Kim has won awards in top ballet competitions: in 1998 she won the Bronze Medal in the 6th USA International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Mississippi, United States. In the same year, she won the First Prize in the 8th Paris International Dance Competition (Le Concours international de danse de Paris) in France, with her partner, Yong-geol Kim. In 1999, after winning the competition, the couple received the Order of Culture Merit: Hwagwan from The Republic of Korea; Kim was the youngest recipient. In 2001 she won the Silver Medal and best art prize in Kazan International Ballet Competition in Tatarstan, Russia and Prima Ballerina Award from Ballet Association in South Korea. In 1999, Kim resigned from the Korea National Ballet and applied to and auditioned for several ballet companies in Europe. She joined Dutch National Ballet in 2002 as a Grand sujet after an offer from the Artistic Director Wayne Eagling of the Dutch National Ballet (Het National Ballet). Kim was promoted to soloist in 2005. In 2007, Kim was promoted to principal and awarded the Alexandra Radius Prize, an incentive prize for young and upcoming talent, from the ballet company. After an invitation from Balletto di Teatro dell'Opera di Roma (Rome Opera ballet), Italy, Kim made her debut as Odette/Odile in Swan Lake. In 2009, Kim rejoined Korea National Ballet but remained in Dutch National Ballet as guest principal dancer. In 2010, Kim danced the premi√®re of Don Quixote as Kitri, with choreography by Alexei Ratmansky, with Dutch National Ballet. Her performance lead to another invitation from Balletto di Teatro dell'Opera di Roma to dance as Kitri in Don Quixote. Subsequently, Kim made her debut with the Bolshoi Ballet with KNB, dancing the roles of Juliet in Romeo and Juliet and Raymonda in Raymonda for the 20th anniversary of Korea-Russia bilateral relations. In April 2011, Kim performed in the Latin dance project \\"Latin Innovation\\". In May, she performed in Sicily, Italy, making her debut as Cinderella in Cinderella with the Teatro Massimo Ballet company. In October 2011, Korea National Ballet was invited as the opener for San Carlo Dance Festival. KNB performed the premi√®re of Prince Hodong and Kim danced the main role, Princess Nakrang, at Teatro di San Carlo (San Carlo Theater) in Naples, Italy. In 2014, Kim performed in \\"Two in Two\\", a collaboration with her rival from the KNB, Kim Joo-won, which incorporates tango, flamenco, ballet and contemporary dance. The two principal ballerinas had shared the role of princess Nakrang in the KNB show \\"Prince Hodong\\" in 2011 at the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples, Italy. Following years of performances with the KNB, she announced her departure from it in summer 2019. Her last performance with the KNB was Giselle at the Seoul Arts Center following which she became a professor of dance at the Kyung Hee University. Style Kim has been described a versatile ballerina, with brilliant academic technique and as deeply expressionistic with beautiful sharp lines. Her elegance has made a great impression in notable classics like Swan Lake, Giselle and La Bayad√®re, and Kim is in perfect harmony with music: she fits with neoclassical and contemporary ballets, like Tchaikovsky's Pas de Deux. It has been noted that her performance as Kitri in Don Quixote is one of her best roles because of her powerful technique and charismatic acting.

The sensor transduces an input electrical signal into a mechanical wave which, unlike an electrical signal, can be easily influenced by physical phenomena. The device then transduces this wave back into an electrical signal. Changes in amplitude, phase, frequency, or time-delay between the input and output electrical signals can be used to measure the presence of the desired phenomenon. Device Layout Surface Acoustic Wave Sensor Interdigitated Transducer Diagram The basic surface acoustic wave device consists of a piezoelectric substrate with an input interdigitated transducer (IDT) on one side of the surface of the substrate, and an output IDT on the other side of the substrate. The space between the IDTs across which the surface acoustic wave propagates is known as the delay line; the signal produced by the input IDT - a physical wave - moves much slower than its associated electromagnetic form, causing a measurable delay. Device Operation Surface acoustic wave technology takes advantage of the piezoelectric effect in its operation. Most modern surface acoustic wave sensors use an input interdigitated transducer (IDT) to convert an electrical signal into an acoustic wave. The sinusoidal electrical input signal creates alternating polarity between the fingers of the interdigitated transducer. Between two adjacent sets of fingers, polarity of the fingers will be switched (e.g. + - +). As a result, the direction of the electric field between two fingers will alternate between adjacent sets of fingers. This creates alternating regions of tensile and compressive strain between fingers of the electrode by the piezoelectric effect, producing a mechanical wave at the surface known as a surface acoustic wave. As fingers on the same side of the device will be at the same level of compression or tension, the space between them---known as the pitch---is the wavelength of the mechanical wave. We can express the synchronous frequency f0 of the device with phase velocity vp and pitch p as: :f_0 = \\\\frac{v_p}{p} The synchronous frequency is the natural frequency at which mechanical waves should propagate. Ideally, the input electric signal should be at the synchronous frequency to minimize insertion loss. As the mechanical wave will propagate in both directions from the input IDT, half of the energy of the waveform will propagate across the delay line in the direction of the output IDT. In some devices, a mechanical absorber or reflector is added between the IDTs and the edges of the substrate to prevent interference patterns or reduce insertion losses, respectively. The acoustic wave travels across the surface of the device substrate to the other interdigitated transducer, converting the wave back into an electric signal by the piezoelectric effect. Any changes that were made to the mechanical wave will be reflected in the output electric signal. As the characteristics of the surface acoustic wave can be modified by changes in the surface properties of the device substrate, sensors can be designed to quantify any phenomenon which alters these properties. Typically, this is accomplished by the addition of mass to the surface or changing the length of the substrate and the spacing between the fingers. Inherent Functionality The structure of the basic surface acoustic wave sensor allows for the phenomena of pressure, strain, torque, temperature, and mass to be sensed. The mechanisms for this are discussed below: =Pressure, Strain, Torque, Temperature= The phenomena of pressure, strain, torque, temperature, and mass can be sensed by the basic device, consisting of two IDTs separated by some distance on the surface of a piezoelectric substrate. These phenomena can all cause a change in length along the surface of the device. A change in length will affect both the spacing between the interdigitated electrodes---altering the pitch---and the spacing between IDTs---altering the delay. This can be sensed as a phase- shift, frequency-shift, or time-delay in the output electrical signal. When a diaphragm is placed between the environment at a variable pressure and a reference cavity at a fixed pressure, the diaphragm will bend in response to a pressure differential. As the diaphragm bends, the distance along the surface in compression will increase. A surface acoustic wave pressure sensor simply replaces the diaphragm with a piezoelectric substrate patterned with interdigitated electrodes. Strain and torque work in a similar manner, as application to the sensor will cause a deformation of the piezoelectric substrate. A surface acoustic wave temperature sensor can be fashioned from a piezoelectric substrate with a relatively high coefficient of thermal expansion in the direction of the length of the device. =Mass= The accumulation of mass on the surface of an acoustic wave sensor will affect the surface acoustic wave as it travels across the delay line. The velocity v of a wave traveling through a solid is proportional to the square root of product of the Young‚Äôs modulus E and the density \\\\scriptstyle \\\\rho of the material. : v \\\\propto \\\\sqrt{E/\\\\rho} Therefore, the wave velocity will decrease with added mass. This change can be measured by a change in time-delay or phase-shift between input and output signals. Signal attenuation could be measured as well, as the coupling with the additional surface mass will reduce the wave energy. In the case of mass-sensing, as the change in the signal will always be due to an increase in mass from a reference signal of zero additional mass, signal attenuation can be effectively used.  Extended Functionality  The inherent functionality of a surface acoustic wave sensor can be extended by the deposition of a thin film of material across the delay line which is sensitive to the physical phenomena of interest. If a physical phenomenon causes a change in length or mass in the deposited thin film, the surface acoustic wave will be affected by the mechanisms mentioned above. Some extended functionality examples are listed below: =Chemical Vapors= Chemical vapor sensors use the application of a thin film polymer across the delay line which selectively absorbs the gas or gases of interest. An array of such sensors with different polymeric coatings can be used to sense a large range of gases on a single sensor with resolution down to parts per trillion, allowing for the creation of a sensitive \\"lab on a chip.\\" =Biological Matter= A biologically-active layer can be placed between the interdigitated electrodes which contains immobilized antibodies. If the corresponding antigen is present in a sample, the antigen will bind to the antibodies, causing a mass-loading on the device. These sensors can be used to detect bacteria and viruses in samples, as well as to quantify the presence of certain mRNA and proteins. =Humidity= Surface acoustic wave humidity sensors require a thermoelectric cooler in addition to a surface acoustic wave device. The thermoelectric cooler is placed below the surface acoustic wave device. Both are housed in a cavity with an inlet and outlet for gases. By cooling the device, water vapor will tend to condense on the surface of the device, causing a mass-loading. =Ultraviolet Radiation= Surface acoustic wave devices are made sensitive to optical wavelengths through the phenomenon known as acoustic charge transport (ACT), which involves the interaction between a surface acoustic wave and photogenerated charge carriers from a photoconducting layer. Ultraviolet radiation sensors use a thin layer of zinc oxide across the delay line. When exposed to ultraviolet radiation, zinc oxide generates charge carriers which interact with the electric fields produced in the piezoelectric substrate by the traveling surface acoustic wave.Kumar, Sanjeev, Gil-Ho Kim, K. Sreenivas, and R. P. Tandon. ZnO Based Surface Acoustic Wave Ultraviolet Photo Sensor Journal of Electroceramics 22.1-3 (2009): 198-202. This interaction produces measurable decreases in both the velocity and amplitude of the acoustic wave signal. =Magnetic Fields= Ferromagnetic materials (such as iron, nickel, and cobalt) change their physical dimensions in the presence of an applied magnetic field, a property called magnetostriction. The Young's modulus of the material is dependent on ambient magnetic field strength. If a film of magnetostrictive material is deposited in the delay line of a surface acoustic wave sensor, the change in length of the deposited film in response to a change in the magnetic field will stress the underlying substrate. The resulting strain (i.e., the deformation of the surface of the substrate) produces measurable changes in the phase velocity, phase-shift, and time-delay of the acoustic wave signal, providing information about the magnetic field. =Viscosity= Surface acoustic wave devices can be used to measure changes in viscosity of a liquid placed upon it. As the liquid becomes more viscous the resonant frequency of the device will change in correspondence. A network analyser is needed to view the resonant frequency.

Plot  Tycho \\"Ty\\" Johns (Connor Trinneer) and Lei Chen (James Kyson Lee) transport a crate for the government, under the orders of Colonel Bishop (Michael Culkin), which contains a mysterious girl (Toni Trucks) in cryogenic stasis. They wake her up and discover that she has no identifying chip in her arm, unlike the rest of society. She also does not speak. During the outer space flight, the ship is attacked by terrorists. After escaping, they crash land onto a planet in uncharted space. The survivors take shelter in an old military facility on the planet. Once inside the facility, the girl picks up a gun and has a psychic vision. In it she sees the death of the last person who held the gun, which causes her to start firing the gun in a wild manner. She comes out of the vision, as someone grabs hers. The group agrees that to cover more ground, they will split up. While Ty and Lei find a control room, the other groups explore the base and find giant bug-like creatures. Lei activates the old computers and discovers that there was a solar storm, which caused the bugs to take cover under the protection of the \\"solar flare shields\\" that surround the compound. They can not leave the shields without burning to death. Here is where the girl first displays her unusual powers (to the group): when a member of their party tries to leave the shield to escape the bugs, the girl runs out of the shields and pulls him back in, receiving no injury, although he suffers deadly burns. Also using the computer system, they are able to view old videos that reveal the original scientists who lived here were killed by the bugs. Meanwhile, the terrorist group that attacked their ship has caught up with them and entered the compound. They have also encountered the bugs and decide to form a temporary truce until they can escape this planet. They are after the girl. While looking for weapons to use against the bugs, a member of their group is attacked by a bug. The girl tries to save him and is injured, only to completely heal in a matter of seconds. The act of healing also seems to have helped her memory, as she now remembers her name‚ÄîAsta. Ty wonders out loud about her, and the leader of the terrorists says, \\"It'll make sense soon,\\" and nothing more. Using the computer system, the team discovers a tunnel to another compound that still has a ship they can use to escape, but when they try to use the tunnels, they are overwhelmed by the bugs. Lei, mortally wounded, sacrifices himself by overloading his pistol, causing a small explosion. The team discovers another of the girl's powers when she is able to create an energy shield to protect them from the blast. Using the computer, they decide to take their chances and run to the other compound in between solar flares. Along the way, the terrorists reveal why this girl is so important to them. According to the government, a human colony of over a million people on the planet Centauri III was completely wiped out by a massive solar flare. These terrorists claim that it was no solar flare. They say that the colony was a group of rebels who did not want to be under the control of the government, so they were wiped out, leaving Asta as the sole survivor. Asta remembers none of this. By the time the team arrives at the other compound, only four people remain: Ty, Asta, one of the terrorists and a woman from the original transport ship named Janessa (Aja Evans). Using the computers in the new compound, they discover what these installations were originally constructed to create a thermonuclear weapon to mimic the radiation signature of a solar flare to use against the citizens of Centauri III (\\"Project Icarus\\"). Watching the video, the team also discovers that the bugs they have been battling are the descendants of stowaway Earth bugs that evolved under the solar activity of this planet. Upon this discovery, Asta's memory completely returns. She remembers the attack on her planet as a child and the military Colonel Bishop who found her and left her there to die in the radiation. With Asta's memory restored, her full powers are unleashed and she creates an energy beam to fight off the bugs. Only three make it off the planet: Asta, Janessa, and Ty, who has promised to take Asta to the terrorist group in the outskirts. Meanwhile, Colonel Bishop, who has been following Ty's progress ever since he found out the ship disappeared, has caught up to them. Janessa is revealed to be Bishop's secret operative, stunning Ty and attempting to kidnap Asta to bring her on board Bishop's ship. Asta overpowers her, but decides to go to Bishop anyway, seeking answers. Bishop reveals that the inhabitants of Centauri III were being \\"changed\\" by the solar flares of their sun. They were developing psychic and telekinetic powers; \\"the next step in human evolution.\\" This is why they were killed, not because of their political beliefs. Asta leaves him alive, telling him of her plans to expose the truth with the videos they downloaded from the compound's computers. Asta wakes Ty and they escape, crippling Bishop's ship in the process. They are forced to crash land on the same planet the others have just escaped from, surrounded by the bugs. The movie ends as Asta and Ty plan to tell the world about Centauri III before heading to the outskirts, as they promised.

During much of his stay there he was confined to the grounds of the asylum, and he made paintings of the garden, the enclosed wheat field that he could see outside his room and a few portraits of individuals at the asylum. During his stay at Saint-Paul asylum, Van Gogh experienced periods of illness when he could not paint. When he was able to resume, painting provided solace and meaning for him. Nature seemed especially meaningful to him, trees, the landscape, even caterpillars as representative of the opportunity for transformation and budding flowers symbolizing the cycle of life. One of the more recognizable works of this period is The Irises. Works of the interior of the hospital convey the isolation and sadness that he felt. From the window of his cell he saw an enclosed wheat field, the subject of many paintings made from his room. He was able to make but a few portraits while at Saint-Paul. Within the grounds he also made paintings that were interpretations of some of his favorite paintings by artists that he admired. When he could leave the grounds of the asylum, he made other works, such as Olive Trees (Van Gogh series) and landscapes of the local area. Van Gogh's Starry Night over the Rhone and The Irises were exhibited at the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants on 3 September 1889, and in January 1890 six of his works were exhibited at the seventh exhibition of Les XX in Brussels. Sadly, just as Van Gogh's work was gaining interest in the artistic community, he was not well enough to fully enjoy it. Saint-R√©my-de-Provence Van Gogh's room in Saint Paul de Mausole Saint-Paul-de-Mausole, twelve miles northeast of Arles, lies just outside Saint-R√©my-de-Provence in southern France. Mentioned on several occasions by Nostradamus, who was born nearby and knew it a Franciscan convent,Lemesurier, P.: Nostradamus, Bibliomancer, New Page Books, New Jersey, 2010, p. 10, it was originally an Augustinian priory dating from the 12th century, and has a particularly beautiful cloister.Guide de Tourisme, Provence, Michelin, Clermont-Ferrand, 1990, p. 172, A well-preserved set of Roman ruins known as les Antiques, the most beautiful of which is le Mausolee, adjoins the property, and forms part of the ancient Graeco-Roman city of Glanum. Mont Gaussier, which overlooks the site, and the Alpilles range can be seen in some of Van Gogh's paintings. Events leading up to stay at the Saint-Paul hospital Following the incident with Paul Gauguin in Arles in December 1888 in which van Gogh cut off part of his left ear he was hospitalized in Arles twice over a few months. Although some, such as Johanna van Gogh, Paul Signac and posthumous speculation by doctors Doiteau & Leroy have said that van Gogh just removed part of his ear lobe and maybe a little more, art historian Rita Wildegans maintains that without exception, all of the witnesses from Arles said that he removed the entire left ear. In January 1889, he returned to the Yellow House where he was living, but spent the following month between hospital and home suffering from hallucinations and delusions that he was being poisoned. In March 1889, the police closed his house after a petition by 30 townspeople, who called him \\"fou roux\\" (the redheaded madman). Paul Signac visited him in hospital and Van Gogh was allowed home in his company. In April 1889, he moved into rooms owned by Dr. F√©lix Rey, after floods damaged paintings in his own home.Pickvance (1986). Chronology, 239‚Äì242Tralbaut (1981), 265‚Äì273 Around this time, he wrote, \\"Sometimes moods of indescribable anguish, sometimes moments when the veil of time and fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart for an instant.\\" Finally in May 1889 he left Arles and traveled to the asylum in Saint-R√©my-de- Provence.Hughes, Robert. Nothing If Not Critical. London: The Harvill Press, 1990 p.145. In Saint-Paul Hospital The Monastery of Saint-Paul de Mausole View of the Asylum and Chapel at Saint Remy 1889 Formerly collection of Elizabeth Taylor (F803)On 8 May 1889 van Gogh voluntarily entered the asylum of St. Paul near Saint-R√©my in the Provence region of southern France. Saint-Paul, which began as an Augustine monastery in the 12th century, was converted into an asylum in the 19th century. It is located in an area of cornfields, vineyards and olive trees at the time run by a former naval doctor, Dr. Th√©ophile Peyron. Theo arranged for two small rooms‚Äîadjoining cells with barred windows. The second was to be used as a studio. Hospital at Saint Remy, 1889, Hammer Museum collection Van Gogh was initially confined to the immediate asylum grounds and painted (without the bars) the world he saw from his room, such as ivy covered trees, lilacs, and irises of the garden. Through the open bars Van Gogh could also see an enclosed wheat field, subject of many paintings at Saint-R√©my. As he ventured outside of the asylum walls, he painted the wheat fields, olive groves, and cypress trees of the surrounding countryside, which he saw as \\"characteristic of Provence.\\" Over the course of the year, he painted about 150 canvases. The imposed regimen of asylum life gave Van Gogh a hard-won stability: \\"I feel happier here with my work than I could be outside. By staying here a good long time, I shall have learned regular habits and in the long run the result will be more order in my life.\\" While his time at Saint-R√©my forced his management of his vices, such as coffee, alcohol, poor eating habits and periodic attempts to consume turpentine and paint, his stay was not ideal. He needed to obtain permission to leave the asylum grounds. The food was poor; he generally ate only bread and soup. His only apparent form of treatment were two-hour baths twice a week. During his year there, Van Gogh would have periodic attacks, possibly due to a form of epilepsy. By early 1890 van Gogh's attacks of illness worsened and he believed that his stay at the asylum was not helping to make him better. This led to his plans to move to Auvers-sur-Oise just north of Paris in May 1890. The corridor The view down the hallway of many arches is one of profound solitude. The use of contrasts creates greater tension. A lone person in the corridor appears lost, similar to the way Van Gogh was feeling. In March 1889 Van Gogh wrote to his brother that a signed petition from his neighbors [in Arles] designated him as unfit to live freely, \\"shut up for long days under lock and key and without warders in the isolation cell, without my culpability being proven or even provable.\\" In a letter to Theo in May 1889 he explains the sounds that travel through the quiet-seeming halls, \\"There is someone here who has been shouting and talking like me all the time for a fortnight. He thinks he hears voices and words in the echoes of the corridors, probably because the auditory nerve is diseased and over-sensitive, and in my case it was both sight and hearing at the same time, which is usual at the onset of epilepsy, according to what Dr. F√©lix Rey said one day.\\" Entrance Hall of Saint-Paul Hospital File:Vincent van Gogh - Corridor in the Asylum.JPGCorridor in Saint-Paul Hospital, Oil color and essence over black chalk on pink laid (\\"Ingres\\") paper 1889 The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (F1529)Corridor in the Asylum, Metropolitan Museum of Art File:Vincent Van Gogh 0012.jpgEntrance Hall of Saint-Paul Hospital, Black chalk, brush and thinned oil on pink paper, 1889 Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F1530) Corner of Saint-Paul Hospital Van Gogh completed two versions of the corner of Saint-Remy hospital gardens. Van Gogh was descriptive in a letter to √âmile Bernard of the setting for these paintings: > \\"A view of the garden of the asylum where I am, on the right a gray terrace, > a section the house, some rosebushes that have lost their flowers; on the > left, the earth of the garden ‚Äì red ochre ‚Äì earth burnt by the sun, covered > in fallen pine twigs.

A wall ‚Äì red ocher again ‚Äì blocks the view, and there‚Äôs nothing > above it but a violet and yellow ochre hill. Now, the first tree is an > enormous trunk, but struck by lightning and sawn off.

For the first month of Van Gogh's stay he could not leave the grounds of the hospital, so he looked to the garden where he painted flowers and trees. To his brother, Theo he wrote, \\"When you receive the canvases that I have done in the garden, you will see that I am not too melancholy here.\\" In the first week in October Van Gogh made several paintings, such as The Mulberry Tree, The Reaper, and Entrance to a Quarry. He also made a painting of trees in the courtyard that he seemed proud of; he wrote, \\"I have two views of the gardens and the asylum in which this place looks very attractive. I‚Äôve tried to reconstruct it as it might have been, simplifying and accentuating the proud, unchanging nature of the pine trees and the clumps of cedar against the blue.\\" File:Van Gogh - B√§ume im Garten des Hospitals Saint-Paul.jpegTrees in the Garden in Front of the Entrance to Saint-Paul Hospital 1889 Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center, Los Angeles, California (F643) File:Van Gogh - B√§ume im Garten des Hospitals Saint-Paul1.jpegTrees in the Garden of the Hospital Saint-Paul 1889 Private Collection (F642) Image:Van Gogh - Banco de Pedra no Asilo de Saint Remy.jpgStone Bench in the Garden of Saint-Paul Hospital 1889 S√£o Paulo Museum of Art, Brazil (F732) Van Gogh also made Flowering Rosebushes in the Asylum Garden also called Flowering Shrub that resides at Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands (F1527).

Van Gogh may have given Pine Trees with Figure in the Garden of Saint-Paul Hospital to Doctor Joseph Peyron; his name is the first in the provenance for the work. Pine Trees and Dandelions includes \\"a pine trunk, pink and purple, and then the grass with some white flowers and dandelions, a little rose bush and some other tree trunks in the background right at the top of the canvas,\\" Van Gogh wrote in a letter to his brother in May 1890.

He wrote, \\"since I have been here, I have had enough work with the overgrown garden with its large pine trees, under which there grows tall and poorly- tended grass, mixed with all kinds of periwinkle.\\" The paintings are of growth below ivy covered trees. Of the first of painting (F745), Van Gogh Museum comments, \\"The effect of light and shade created an almost abstract pattern, with small arcs of paint covering the entire surface of the canvas.\\" The second (F746), also of undergrowth beneath trees, is made with small brushstrokes to create a blurred image that also shows the effect of light shining through the shaded trees. Ivy, originally Le Lierre is a painting Van Gogh made May 1889. Van Gogh incorporated the first version in his selection of works to be displayed at Les XX, Brussels, in 1890.

About the time that Van Gogh painted this work, he wrote to his mother, \\"But for one's health, as you say, it is very necessary to work in the garden and see the flowers growing.\\" To his sister Wil he wrote, \\"The last days in Saint-R√©my I worked like a madman. Great bouquets of flowers, violet-colored irises, great bouquets of roses.\\" =Irises= Van Gogh made Irises from the irises in the asylum's garden. The painting seems influenced by Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints due to its close-up views, large areas of bright color and irises appearing to overflow the borders of the frame. He considered this painting a study, which is probably why there are no known drawings for it, although Theo, Van Gogh's brother, thought better of it and quickly submitted it to the annual exhibition of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants in September 1889. He wrote to Vincent of the exhibition: \\"[It] strikes the eye from afar. The Irises are a beautiful study full of air and life.\\" A single iris is the subject of the second painting, smartly posed in the center. Like rays of the sun, brush strokes radiate out from the plant. Iris, with one full bloom, may have been painted before Irises that was filled with blooms. File:VanGoghIrises2.jpgIrises 1889 J.

The Hermitage Museum, holder of this painting, describes it, \\"Van Gogh depicted a lilac bush in the hospital gardens, the broken, separate brushstrokes and vibrant forms recalling the lessons of Impressionism, yet with a spatial dynamism unknown to the Impressionists. This bush is full of powerful, vivid energy and dramatic expression. The modest natural motif is transformed by the master's temperament and the brilliance of his emotions. Embodied here in this fragment of an overgrown garden we find all of nature's life-giving forces. In rejecting Impressionism, Van Gogh created his own artistic language, expressing the artist's romantic, passionate and deeply dramatic perception of the world.\\" File:Van Gogh - Fliederstrauch.jpegLilacs May 1889 Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia (F579) Floral still life Van Gogh had not painted still life during his stay at Saint-R√©my until the very last month of his year-long stay when he painted four striking bouquets of irises and roses. To his sister Wil he wrote, \\"The last days in Saint-R√©my I worked like a madman. Great bouquets of flowers, violet-colored irises, great bouquets of roses.\\" Van Gogh's mother owned both upright versions of the irises and roses paintings held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art until her death in 1907. =Vase with Irises= In one of the iris paintings he places the large bunch of violet irises against a harmonious pink background. Unfortunately, over time, the pink background has faded to almost white. In the other, he use a contrasting yellow background.

As the end of his stay in Saint-R√©my and the days ahead in Auvers-sur-Oise neared, Van Gogh conveyed his optimism and enthusiasm by painting flowers. About the time that van Gogh painted this work, he wrote to his mother, \\"But for one's health, as you say, it is very necessary to work in the garden and see the flowers growing.\\" The National Gallery of Art describes the painting, \\"The undulating ribbons of paint, applied in diagonal strokes, animate the canvas and play-off the furled forms of flowers and leaves. Originally, the roses were pink‚Äîthe color has faded‚Äîand would have created a contrast of complementary colors with the green.\\" The exuberant bouquets of roses is said to be one of Van Gogh's largest, most beautiful still life paintings. Van Gogh made another painting of roses in Saint-R√©my, which is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

(F681) File:Van Gogh - Vase mit Rosen1.jpegStill Life: Pink Roses in a Vase May 1890 The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (F682) Butterflies Van Gogh made at least two paintings of butterflies and one of a moth while at Saint- R√©my. =Poppies and Butterflies= Debra Mancoff, author of Van Gogh's Flowers, described Poppies and Butterflies: \\"vivid red poppies and the pale yellow butterflies float on the surface of twisting dark stems and nodding buds, all against a yellow-gold background. Although composed of natural motifs, van Gogh's layering of pattern in Butterflies and Poppies suggests a decorative quality like that of a textile or a screen.\\" Mancoff compared this study to the Japanese prints he admired. =Long Grass with Butterflies= London's National Gallery painting Long Grass with Butterflies, also called Meadow in the Garden of Saint-Paul Hospital, is a view of an abandoned garden with tall unkempt grass and weeds on the asylum grounds. The work was made towards the end of his stay in Saint-R√©my. =Green Peacock Moth= In May 1889 Van Gogh began work on Green Peacock Moth which he self-titled Death's Head Moth. The moth, called death's head, is a rarely seen nocturnal moth. He described the large moth's colors \\"of amazing distinction, black, grey, cloudy white tinged with carmine or vaguely shading off into olive green.\\" Behind the moth is a background of Lords-and-Ladies. The size of the moth and plants in the background pull the spectator into the work. The colors are vivid, consistent with Van Gogh's passion and emotional intensity. Van Gogh Museum's title for this work is Emperor Moth.

Since 1941 it has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Reproduced often, the painting is widely hailed as his magnum opus. The Wheat Field Van Gogh worked on a group of paintings The Wheat Field based on the field of wheat enclosed by a wall that he could see from his cell at Saint-Paul Hospital. Beyond the field were the mountains from Arles. During his stay at the asylum he made about twelve paintings of the view of the enclosed wheat field and distant mountains. In May Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \\"Through the iron-barred window I see a square field of wheat in an enclosure, a perspective like Van Goyen, above which I see the morning sun rising in all its glory.\\" The stone wall, like a picture frame, helped to display the changing colors of the wheat field.

Van Gogh generally saw the Alpilles from his room or the grounds of Saint-Paul hospital. In Van Gogh's Le Mont Gaussier with the Mas de Saint-Paul the Alpilles are painted in yellow, green and purple. Left of Mont Gaussier is the Montagne des Deux Trous. In van Gogh's painting of this hill its dark holes are visible about the \\"undulating olive trees.\\" File:Van Gogh - Blick auf den Mont Gaussier.jpegLe Mont Gaussier with the Mas de Saint-Paul (b/w copy) 1889 Private collection (F725) File:Van Gogh The Olive Trees..jpgMontagne des Deux Trous also Olive Trees in a Mountainous Landscape (with the Alpilles in the Background) 1889 Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY (F712) Portraits Van Gogh, known for his landscapes, seemed to find painting portraits his greatest ambition. To his sister he wrote, \\"I should like to paint portraits which appear after a century to people living then as apparitions. By which I mean that I do not endeavor to achieve this through photographic resemblance, but my means of our impassioned emotions ‚Äì that is to say using our knowledge and our modern taste for color as a means of arriving at the expression and the intensification of the character.\\" While Van Gogh had few opportunities to make portraits, he completed at least three at Saint-R√©my. Fran√ßois and Jeanne Trabuc Fran√ßois Trabuc, who was the chief orderly at Saint-Paul, and his wife, Jeanne both sat for van Gogh. Fran√ßois Trabuc had a look of \\"contemplative calm\\" which van Gogh found interesting in spite of the misery he had witness at Saint-Paul and a Marseille hospital during outbreaks of cholera. He wrote to Theo of Trabuc's character, a military presence and \\"small keen black eyes\\". If it were not for his intelligence and kindness, his eyes could seem like that of a bird of prey. Van Gogh describes Jeanne Trabuc as a \\"washed-out kind of a woman, and unhappy, resigned creature of little consequence and so insignificant that I have a great desire to paint this dusty blade of grade. I‚Äôve chatted with her a few times when I was doing some olive trees behind their little house, and she told me that she didn‚Äôt think I was ill ‚Äì indeed you would say the same right now if you could see me working.\\" Portrait of a patient While in Saint-Paul, Van Gogh wrote of other patients and their support for one another, \\"Though here there are some patients very seriously ill, the fear and horror of madness that I used to have has already lessened a great deal. And though here you continually hear terrible cries and howls like beasts in a menagerie, in spite of that people get to know each other very well and help each other when their attacks come on.\\"Helvey, \\"Irises: Vincent van Gogh in the Garden,\\" p. 108 Van Gogh wrote of a portrait he began in October 1889, \\"At the moment I am working on a portrait of one of the patients here. It is odd that when you have spent some time with them and have got used to them, you no longer think of them as mad.\\" Image:Vincent Willem van Gogh 093.jpgPortrait of Trabuc; Chief Orderly at Saint-Paul Hospital 1889 Kunstmuseum Solothurn, Solothrun, Switzerland (F629) File:Van Gogh - Bildnis Madame Trabuc.jpegPortrait of Madame Trabuc (b/w copy) 1889 The Hermitage, St. Petersburg, Russia (F631) File:Van Gogh - Bildnis eines Patienten im Hospital Saint-Paul.jpegPortrait of a Patient in Saint-Paul Hospital 1889 Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, Netherlands (F703) Interest in van Gogh's work builds While in Saint-Remy interest began to build in van Gogh's work: * Theo, Van Gogh's brother, wrote in July 1889, that Camille and Lucien Pissarro, P√®re Tanguy, Erik Theodor Werenskiold and Octave Maus, secretary of the Les XX group in Brussels, had seen the paintings that he'd made in southern France. On Van Gogh's behalf, Theo accepted an offer from Maus to exhibit Van Gogh's work at the Les XX group's upcoming exhibition. * Van Gogh's Starry Night over the Rhone and The Irises were exhibited at the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants on the third of September. * In January 1890 six of Van Gogh's works were exhibited at the seventh exhibition of Les XX in Brussels along with, among others, Paul C√©zanne, Camille Pissarro, Pierre- Auguste Renoir, Paul Signac and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. Van Gogh's painting The Red Vineyard was sold to artist Anna Boch at the exhibition for 400 francs. * In the same month an article is published \\"Les Isole: Vincent van Gogh\\" in the Mercure de France. * Ten of Van Gogh's works were presented at the March 1890 Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants. Paul Gauguin, Claude Monet, and Pissarro were quite impressed with his works. Over this time, though, Van Gogh's health ebbed and flowed between periods of attacks, recovery, and resumption of painting. In April 1890, near the end of van Gogh's stay at Saint-Paul's hospital, Theo wrote to his sister and mother, \\"I am so pleased that Vincent's work is being more appreciated. If he were fit I believe that there would be nothing for me to desire, but it appears that this is not to be.\\" The sale of Red Vineyard was the only sale of van Gogh's paintings made during his lifetime.

The Android version was released in April 2012, followed by a feature- limited desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by hashtags and geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations and view trending content. Users can like photos and follow other users to add their content to a feed, a function that seems to be discontinued as of September 2020. Instagram was originally distinguished by only allowing content to be framed in a square (1:1) aspect ratio with 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, these restrictions were eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. The service also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a Stories feature‚Äîsimilar to its main opposition Snapchat‚Äîwhich allows users to post photos and videos to a sequential feed, with each post accessible by others for 24 hours each. As of January 2019, the Stories feature is used by 500 million users daily. After its launch in 2010, Instagram rapidly gained popularity, with one million registered users in two months, 10 million in a year, and 1 billion . In April 2012, Facebook acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. , over 40 billion photos had been uploaded. Although praised for its influence, Instagram has been the subject of criticism, most notably for policy and interface changes, allegations of censorship, and illegal or improper content uploaded by users. As of July 2020, the most followed person is footballer Cristiano Ronaldo with over 233 million followers. As of January 14, 2019, the most-liked photo on Instagram is a picture of an egg, posted by the account @world_record_egg, created with the sole purpose of surpassing the previous record of 18 million likes on a Kylie Jenner post. The picture currently has over 54 million likes. Instagram became the 4th most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s. History Instagram Icon from 2011 to 2016 Instagram Icon since 2016 Instagram began development in San Francisco as Burbn, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. Realizing that Burbn was too similar to Foursquare, Systrom and Krieger refocused their app on photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature among Burbn users. They renamed the app Instagram, a portmanteau of \\"instant camera\\" and \\"telegram\\".  2010‚Äì2011: Beginnings and major funding  On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn. Josh Riedel joined the company in October as Community Manager, Shayne Sweeney joined in November as an engineer, and Jessica Zollman joined as a Community Evangelist in August 2011. The first Instagram post was a photo of South Beach Harbor at Pier 38, posted by Mike Krieger at 5:26 PM on July 16, 2010. Systrom shared his first post, a picture of a dog and his girlfriend's foot, a few hours later at 9:24 PM. It has been wrongly attributed as the first Instagram photo due to the earlier letter of the alphabet in its URL. On October 6, 2010, the Instagram iOS app was officially released through the App Store. In February 2011, it was reported that Instagram had raised $7 million in Series A funding from a variety of investors, including Benchmark Capital, Jack Dorsey, Chris Sacca (through Capital fund), and Adam D'Angelo. The deal valued Instagram at around $20 million. In April 2012, Instagram raised $50 million from venture capitalists with a $500 million valuation. Joshua Kushner was the second largest investor in Instagram's Series B fundraising round, leading his investment firm, Thrive Capital, to double its money after the sale to Facebook.  2012‚Äì2014: Additional platforms and acquisition by Facebook  On April 3, 2012, Instagram released a version of its app for Android phones, and it was downloaded more than one million times in less than one day. The Android app has since received two significant updates: first, in March 2014, which cut the file size of the app by half and added performance improvements; then in April 2017, to add an offline mode that allows users to view and interact with content without an Internet connection. At the time of the announcement, it was reported that 80% of Instagram's 600 million users are located outside the U.S., and while the aforementioned functionality was live at its announcement, Instagram also announced its intention to make more features available offline, and that they were \\"exploring an iOS version\\". On April 9, 2012, Facebook, Inc. bought Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock, with a plan to keep the company independently managed. Britain's Office of Fair Trading approved the deal on August 14, 2012, and on August 22, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. closed its investigation, allowing the deal to proceed. On September 6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and Facebook officially closed with a purchase price of $300 million in cash and 23 million shares of stock. The deal closed just before Facebook's scheduled initial public offering according to CNN. The deal price was compared to the $35 million Yahoo! paid for Flickr in 2005. Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook was \\"committed to building and growing Instagram independently.\\" According to Wired, the deal netted Systrom $400 million. In November 2012, Instagram launched website profiles, allowing anyone to see user feeds from a web browser with limited functionality. Since the app's launch it had used the Foursquare API technology to provide named location tagging. In March 2014, Instagram started to test and switch the technology to use Facebook Places.  2015‚Äì2017: Redesign and Windows app  In June 2015, the desktop website user interface was redesigned to become more flat and minimalistic, but with more screen space for each photo and to resemble the layout of Instagram's mobile website. Furthermore, one row of pictures only has three instead of five photos to match the mobile layout. The slideshow bannerPre-2015 Instagram website layout screenshot.Pre-June-2015 Instagram website layout screenshot with \\"slideshow banner\\" on the top of profile pages, which simultaneously slide-showed seven picture tiles of pictures posted by the user, alternating at different times in a random order, has been removed. In addition, the formerly angular profile pictures became circular. On May 11, 2016, Instagram revamped its design, adding a black-and-white flat design theme for the app's user interface, and a less skeuomorphistic, more abstract, \\"modern\\" and colorful icon. Rumors of a redesign first started circulating in April, when The Verge received a screenshot from a tipster, but at the time, an Instagram spokesperson simply told the publication that it was only a concept. On December 6, 2016, Instagram introduced comment liking. However, unlike post likes, the user who posted a comment does not receive notifications about comment likes in their notification inbox. Uploaders can optionally decide to deactivate comments onto a post. In April 2016, Instagram released a Windows 10 Mobile app, after years of demand from Microsoft and the public to release an app for the platform. The platform previously had a beta version of Instagram, first released on November 21, 2013 for Windows Phone 8. The new app added support for videos (viewing and creating posts or stories, and viewing live streams), album posts and direct messages. Similarly, an app for Windows 10 personal computers and tablets was released in October 2016. In May, Instagram updated its mobile website to allow users to upload photos, and to add a \\"lightweight\\" version of the Explore tab. On April 30, 2019, the Windows 10 Mobile app was discontinued, though the mobile website remains available as a progressive web application (PWA) with limited functionality. The app remains available on Windows 10 computers and tablets, also updated to a PWA in 2020.  2018‚Äìpresent: IGTV, Reels, management changes and new features  IGTV launched on June 20, 2018 as a standalone video application. On September 24, 2018, Krieger and Systrom announced in a statement they would be stepping down from Instagram. On October 1, 2018, it was announced that Adam Mosseri would be the new head of Instagram. During Facebook F8, it was announced that Instagram would, beginning in Canada, pilot the removal of publicly-displayed \\"like\\" counts for content posted by other users. Like counts would only be visible to the user who originally posted the content. Mosseri stated that this was intended to have users \\"worry a little bit less about how many likes they're getting on Instagram and spend a bit more time connecting with the people that they care about.\\" It has been argued that low numbers of likes in relativity to others could contribute to a lower self- esteem in users. The pilot began in May 2019, and was extended to 6 other markets in July. The pilot was expanded worldwide in November 2019. Also in July 2019, Instagram announced that it would implement new features designed to reduce harassment and negative comments on the service. In August 2019, Instagram also began to pilot the removal of the \\"Following\\" tab from the app, which had allowed users to view a feed of the likes and comments made by users they follow. The change was made official in October, with head of product Vishal Shah stating that the feature was underused and that some users were \\"surprised\\" when they realized their activity was being surfaced in this manner. Already in October 2019, there were articles describing that Instagram introduced a limit on the number of posts visible to people not logged-in in page scrolling mode (until then public profiles had been available to everyone). This restrictions seems to have been expanded to also include logged in users as pr. September 2020. In March 2020, Instagram launched a new feature called \\"Co-Watching\\". The new feature allows users to share posts with each other over video calls. According to Instagram, they pushed forward the launch of Co-Watching in order to meet the demand for virtually connecting with friends and family as more people are told to stay at home and \\"social distance\\" as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In August 2020, Instagram launched a new feature called \\"Instagram Reels\\". The feature is similar to TikTok.https://media.thinknum.com/articles/instagram-reels-tiktok-data- snapchat-influencers/ At about the same time, Instagram restricted users feed to show only the absolutely latest of postings from accounts they follow. Older post got removed from the feed. Instead the feed got filled up by \\"suggestions\\", partly claimed to be based on what the user liked or followed, but whitout any connections to the users preferences, and partly allegdedly being based on the suggested account being popular on Instagram. Features and tools An original photograph (left) is automatically cropped to a square by Instagram, and has a filter added at the selection of the user (right). Instagram filters available in 2011 Users can upload photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds, and geotag images with the name of a location. Users can set their account as \\"private\\", thereby requiring that they approve any new follower requests. Users can connect their Instagram account to other social networking sites, enabling them to share uploaded photos to those sites. In September 2011, a new version of the app included new and live filters, instant tilt‚Äìshift, high-resolution photographs, optional borders, one-click rotation, and an updated icon. Photos were initially restricted to a square, 1:1 aspect ratio; since August 2015, the app supports portrait and widescreen aspect ratios as well. Users could formerly view a map of a user's geotagged photos. The feature was removed in September 2016, citing low usage. Since December 2016, posts can be \\"saved\\" into a private area of the app. The feature was updated in April 2017 to let users organize saved posts into named collections. Users can also \\"archive\\" their posts in a private storage area, out of visibility for the public and other users. The move was seen as a way to prevent users from deleting photos that don't garner a desired number of \\"likes\\" or are deemed boring, but also as a way to limit the \\"emergent behavior\\" of deleting photos, which deprives the service of content. In August, Instagram announced that it would start organizing comments into threads, letting users more easily interact with replies. Since February 2017, up to ten pictures or videos can be included in a single post, with the content appearing as a swipeable carousel. The feature originally limited photos to the square format, but received an update in August to enable portrait and landscape photos instead. In April 2018, Instagram launched its version of a portrait mode called \\"focus mode,\\" which gently blurs the background of a photo or video while keeping the subject in focus when selected. In November, Instagram began to support Alt text to add descriptions of photos for the visually impaired. They are either generated automatically using object recognition (using existing Facebook technology) or manually specified by the uploader.  Hashtags  In January 2011, Instagram introduced hashtags to help users discover both photos and each other. Instagram encourages users to make tags both specific and relevant, rather than tagging generic words like \\"photo\\", to make photographs stand out and to attract like-minded Instagram users. Users on Instagram have created \\"trends\\" through hashtags. The trends deemed the most popular on the platform often highlight a specific day of the week to post the material on. Examples of popular trends include #SelfieSunday, in which users post a photo of their faces on Sundays; #MotivationMonday, in which users post motivational photos on Mondays; #TransformationTuesday, in which users post photos highlighting differences from the past to the present; #WomanCrushWednesday, in which users post photos of women they have a romantic interest in or view favorably, as well as its #ManCrushMonday counterpart centered on men; and #ThrowbackThursday, in which users post a photo from their past, highlighting a particular moment. In December 2017, Instagram began to allow users to follow hashtags, which display relevant highlights of the topic in their feeds. Explore In June 2012, Instagram introduced \\"Explore\\", a tab inside the app that displays popular photos, photos taken at nearby locations, and search. The tab was updated in June 2015 to feature trending tags and places, curated content, and the ability to search for locations. In April 2016, Instagram added a \\"Videos You Might Like\\" channel to the tab, followed by an \\"Events\\" channel in August, featuring videos from concerts, sports games, and other live events, followed by the addition of Instagram Stories in October. The tab was later expanded again in November 2016 after Instagram Live launched to display an algorithmically-curated page of the \\"best\\" Instagram Live videos currently airing. In May 2017, Instagram once again updated the Explore tab to promote public Stories content from nearby places. Photographic filters Instagram offers a number of photographic filters that users can apply to their images: * Normal: No filter applied. * 1977: The increased exposure with a red tint gives the photograph a rosy, brighter, faded look. * Amaro: Adds light to an image, with the focus on the center. * Brannan: Increases contrast and exposure and adds a metallic tint. * Earlybird: Gives photographs an older look with a sepia tint and warm temperature. * Hefe: High contrast and saturation, with a similar effect to Lo-Fi but not quite as dramatic. * Hudson: Creates an \\"icy\\" illusion with heightened shadows, a cool tint and a dodged center. * Inkwell: Direct shift to black-and-white ‚Äì no extra editing. * Kelvin: Increases saturation and temperature to give it a radiant \\"glow\\". * Lo-fi: Enriches color and adds strong shadows through the use of saturation and \\"warming\\" the temperature. * Mayfair: Applies a warm pink tone, subtle vignetting to brighten the photograph center and a thin black border. * Nashville: Warms the temperature, lowers contrast and increases exposure to give a light \\"pink\\" tint ‚Äì making it feel \\"nostalgic\\". * Rise: Adds a \\"glow\\" to the image, with softer lighting of the subject. * Sierra: Gives a faded, softer look. * Sutro: Burns photo edges, increases highlights and shadows dramatically with a focus on purple and brown colors. * Toaster: Ages the image by \\"burning\\" the center and adds a dramatic vignette. * Valencia: Fades the image by increasing exposure and warming the colors, to give it an antique feel. * Walden: Increases exposure and adds a yellow tint. * Willow: A monochromatic filter with subtle purple tones and a translucent white border. * X-Pro II: Increases color vibrancy with a golden tint, high contrast and slight vignette added to the edges. * Slumber: Desaturates the image as well as adds haze for a retro, dreamy look ‚Äì with an emphasis on blacks and blues. * Cream: Adds a creamy look that both warms and cools the image. * Ludwig: A slight hint of desaturation that also enhances light. * Aden: This filter gives a blue/green natural look. * Perpetua: Adding a pastel look, this filter is ideal for portraits. * Clarendon: Intensifies shadows and brightens highlights. Originally released as a video-only filter. * Gingham: Washes photos out. Gives a yellowish tone when used on dark photos or a brighter, dreamy look when used on light photos. * Moon: Black-and-white version of Gingham, with slightly more intense shadows. * Stinson: Subtle filter that brightens an image, washing out the colors slightly. * Crema: A vintage filter that desaturates images. Smooths and washes out skin tones. * Lark: Desaturates reds while punching up blues and greens ‚Äì brings landscapes to life. * Reyes: Gives photos a dusty, vintage look. * Juno: Tints cool tones green, makes warm tones pop and whites glow ‚Äì for vibrant photos of people. In February 2012, Instagram added a \\"Lux\\" filter, an effect that \\"lightens shadows, darkens highlights and increases contrast\\". In December 2014, Slumber, Crema, Ludwig, Aden, and Perpetua were five new filters to be added to the Instagram filter family. Video Initially a purely photo-sharing service, Instagram incorporated 15-second video sharing in June 2013. The addition was seen by some in the technology media as Facebook's attempt at competing with the then-popular video-sharing application Vine. In August 2015, Instagram added support for widescreen videos. In March 2016, Instagram increased the 15-second video limit to 60 seconds. Albums were introduced in February 2017, which allow up to 10 minutes of video to be shared in one post. =IGTV= IGTV is a vertical video application launched by Instagram\\"INTRODUCING IGTV ‚Äì The next generation of video\\" on Business.Instagram.com. in June 2018. Basic functionality is also available within the Instagram app and website. IGTV allows uploads of up to 10 minutes in length with a file size of up to 650 MB, with verified and popular users allowed to upload videos of up to 60 minutes in length with a file size of up to 5.4 GB. The app automatically begins playing videos as soon as it is launched, which CEO Kevin Systrom contrasted to video hosts where one must first locate a video. = Reels = In November 2019, it was reported that Instagram had begun to pilot a new video feature known as \\"Reels\\" in Brazil, expanding to France and Germany afterwards. It is similar in functionality to the Chinese video-sharing service TikTok, with a focus on allowing users to record short videos set to pre-existing sound clips from other posts. Users could make up to 15 second videos using this feature. Reels also integrates with existing Instagram filters and editing tools. In July 2020, Instagram rolled out Reels to India after TikTok was banned in the country. The following month, Reels officially launched in 50 countries including the United States, Canada and United Kingdom. The Instagram has recently introduce a reel button on home page. Instagram Direct In December 2013, Instagram announced Instagram Direct, a feature that lets users interact through private messaging. Users who follow each other can send private messages with photos and videos, in contrast to the public-only requirement that was previously in place. When users receive a private message from someone they don't follow, the message is marked as pending and the user must accept to see it. Users can send a photo to a maximum of 15 people. The feature received a major update in September 2015, adding conversation threading and making it possible for users to share locations, hashtag pages, and profiles through private messages directly from the news feed. Additionally, users can now reply to private messages with text, emoji or by clicking on a heart icon. A camera inside Direct lets users take a photo and send it to the recipient without leaving the conversation. A new update in November 2016 let users make their private messages \\"disappear\\" after being viewed by the recipient, with the sender receiving a notification if the recipient takes a screenshot. In April 2017, Instagram redesigned Direct to combine all private messages, both permanent and ephemeral, into the same message threads. In May, Instagram made it possible to send website links in messages, and also added support for sending photos in their original portrait or landscape orientation without cropping. In April 2020, Direct became accessible from the Instagram website. In August 2020, Facebook started merging Instagram Direct into Facebook Messenger. After the update (which is rolled out to a segment of the user base) the Instagram Direct icon transforms into Facebook Messenger icon. Instagram Stories In August 2016, Instagram launched Instagram Stories, a feature that allows users to take photos, add effects and layers, and add them to their Instagram story. Images uploaded to a user's story expire after 24 hours. The media noted the feature's similarities to Snapchat. In response to criticism that it copied functionality from Snapchat, CEO Kevin Systrom told Recode that \\"Day One: Instagram was a combination of Hipstamatic, Twitter [and] some stuff from Facebook like the 'Like' button. You can trace the roots of every feature anyone has in their app, somewhere in the history of technology\\". Although Systrom acknowledged the criticism as \\"fair\\", Recode wrote that \\"he likened the two social apps' common features to the auto industry: Multiple car companies can coexist, with enough differences among them that they serve different consumer audiences\\". Systrom further stated that \\"When we adopted [Stories], we decided that one of the really annoying things about the format is that it just kept going and you couldn't pause it to look at something, you couldn't rewind. We did all that, we implemented that.\\" He also told the publication that Snapchat \\"didn't have filters, originally. They adopted filters because Instagram had filters and a lot of others were trying to adopt filters as well.\\" In November, Instagram added live video functionality to Instagram Stories, allowing users to broadcast themselves live, with the video disappearing immediately after ending. In January 2017, Instagram launched skippable ads, where five-second photo and 15-second video ads appear in- between different stories. In April 2017, Instagram Stories incorporated augmented reality stickers, a \\"clone\\" of Snapchat's functionality. In May 2017, Instagram expanded the augmented reality sticker feature to support face filters, letting users add specific visual features onto their faces. Later in May, TechCrunch reported about tests of a Location Stories feature in Instagram Stories, where public Stories content at a certain location are compiled and displayed on a business, landmark or place's Instagram page. A few days later, Instagram announced \\"Story Search\\", in which users can search for geographic locations or hashtags and the app displays relevant public Stories content featuring the search term. In June 2017, Instagram revised its live-video functionality to allow users to add their live broadcast to their story for availability in the next 24 hours, or discard the broadcast immediately. In July, Instagram started allowing users to respond to Stories content by sending photos and videos, complete with Instagram effects such as filters, stickers, and hashtags. Stories were made available for viewing on Instagram's mobile and desktop websites in late August 2017. On December 5, 2017, Instagram introduced \\"Story Highlights\\", also known as \\"Permanent Stories\\", which are similar to Instagram Stories, but don't expire. They appear as circles below the profile picture and biography and are accessible from the desktop website as well. In June 2018, the daily active story users of Instagram had reached 400 million users, and monthly active users had reached 1 billion active users. Advertising Emily White joined Instagram as Director of Business Operations in April 2013 She stated in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in September 2013 that the company should be ready to begin selling advertising by September 2014 as a way to generate business from a popular entity that had not yet created profit for its parent company. White left Instagram in December 2013 to join Snapchat. In August 2014, James Quarles became Instagram's Global Head of Business and Brand Development, tasked with overseeing advertisement, sales efforts and developing new \\"monetization products.\\" according to a spokesperson. In October 2013, Instagram announced that video and image ads would soon appear in feeds for users in the United States, with the first image advertisements displaying on November 1, 2013. Video ads followed nearly a year later on October 30, 2014. In June 2014, Instagram announced the rollout of ads in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, with ads starting to roll out that autumn. In March 2015, Instagram announced it would implement \\"carousel ads,\\" allowing advertisers to display multiple images with options for linking to additional content. The company launched carousel image ads in October 2015, and video carousel ads in March 2016. In May 2016, Instagram launched new tools for business accounts, including business profiles, analytics and the ability to promote posts as ads. To access the tools, businesses had to link a corresponding Facebook page. The new analytics page, known as Instagram Insights, allowed business accounts to view top posts, reach, impressions, engagement and demographic data. Insights rolled out first in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, and expanded to the rest of the world later in 2016. In February 2016, Instagram announced that it had 200,000 advertisers on the platform. This number increased to 500,000 by September 2016, and 1 million in March 2017. In November 2018, Instagram added the ability for business accounts to add product links directing users to a purchase page or to save them to a \\"shopping list.\\" In April 2019, Instagram added the option to \\"Checkout on Instagram,\\" which allows merchants to sell products directly through the Instagram app. In March 2020, via a blog post, Instagram announced that they are making major moderation changes in order to decrease the flow of disinformation, hoaxes and fake news regarding COVID-19 on its platform, \\"We'll remove COVID-19 accounts from account recommendations, and we are working to remove some COVID-19 related content from Explore unless posted by a credible health organization. We will also start to downrank content in feed and Stories that has been rated false by third-party fact- checkers.\\" Stand-alone apps Instagram has developed and released three stand-alone apps with specialized functionality. In July 2014, it released Bolt, a messaging app where users click on a friend's profile photo to quickly send an image, with the content disappearing after being seen. It was followed by the release of Hyperlapse in August, an iOS-exclusive app that uses \\"clever algorithm processing\\" to create tracking shots and fast time-lapse videos. Microsoft launched a Hyperlapse app for Android and Windows in May 2015, but there has been no official Hyperlapse app from Instagram for either of these platforms to date. In October 2015, it released Boomerang, a video app that combines photos into short, one-second videos that play back-and-forth in a loop. Third-party services The popularity of Instagram has led to a variety of third-party services designed to integrate with it, including services for creating content to post on the service and generating content from Instagram photos (including physical print-outs), analytics, and alternative clients for platforms with insufficient or no official support from Instagram (such as in the past, iPads). In November 2015, Instagram announced that effective June 1, 2016, it would end \\"feed\\" API access to its platform in order to \\"maintain control for the community and provide a clear roadmap for developers\\" and \\"set up a more sustainable environment built around authentic experiences on the platform\\", including those oriented towards content creation, publishers, and advertisers. It was reported that these changes were primarily intended to discourage third-party clients replicating the entire Instagram experience (due to increasing monetization of the service), and security reasons (such as preventing abuse by automated click farms, and the hijacking of accounts). In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Instagram began to impose further restrictions on its API in 2018. For unlimited browsing of public Instagram profiles without having to create an account, as well as for anonymous browsing of someone else's Stories, has to use the Instagram profiles viewer. Stories are more authentic than typical photos posted as posts because users know that in 24 hours their Stories will disappear if they don't add them as highlighted (however users can check who saw their Story for 48 hours after it was published). For this reason, they are very valuable for market research. Fact checking On December 16, 2019, Facebook announced it would expand its fact checking programs towards Instagram, by using third-party fact-checkers organizations false information is able to be identified, reviewed and labeled as false information. Content when rated as false or partly false is removed from the explore page and hashtag pages, additionally content rated as false or partly false are labeled as such. With the addition of Facebook fact-checking program came the use of image matching technology to find further instances of misinformation. If a piece of content is labeled false or partly false on Facebook or Instagram then duplicates of such content will also be labeled as false. User characteristics and behavior The Instagram app, running on the Android operating system Users Following the release in October, Instagram had one million registered users in December 2010. In June 2011, it announced that it had 5 million users, which increased to 10 million in September. This growth continued to 30 million users in April 2012, 80 million in July 2012, 100 million in February 2013, 130 million in June 2013, 150 million in September 2013, 300 million in December 2014, 400 million in September 2015, 500 million in June 2016, 600 million in December 2016, 700 million in April 2017, and 800 million in September 2017. In October 2016, Instagram Stories reached 100 million active users, two months after launch. This increased to 150 million in January 2017, 200 million in April, surpassing Snapchat's user growth, and 250 million active users in June 2017. In April 2017, Instagram Direct had 375 million monthly users. In June 2011, Instagram passed 100 million photos uploaded to the service. This grew to 150 million in August 2011, and by June 2013, there were over 16 billion photos on the service. In October 2015, there existed over 40 billion photos. =Demographics= Instagram's users are divided equally with 50% iPhone owners and 50% Android owners. While Instagram has a neutral gender-bias format, 68% of Instagram users are female while 32% are male. Instagram's geographical use is shown to favor urban areas as 17% of US adults who live in urban areas use Instagram while only 11% of adults in suburban and rural areas do so. While Instagram may appear to be one of the most widely used sites for photo sharing, only 7% of daily photo uploads, among the top four photo- sharing platforms, come from Instagram. Instagram has been proven to attract the younger generation with 90% of the 150 million users under the age of 35. From June 2012 to June 2013, Instagram approximately doubled their number of users. With regards to income, 15% of US Internet users who make less than $30,000 per year use Instagram, while 14% of those making $30,000 to $50,000, and 12% of users who make more than $50,000 per year do so. With respect to the education demographic, respondents with some college education proved to be the most active on Instagram with 23%. Following behind, college graduates consist of 18% and users with a high school diploma or less make up 15%. Among these Instagram users, 24% say they use the app several times a day.  User behavior  Ongoing research continues to explore how media content on the platform affects user engagement. Past research has found that media which show peoples' faces receive more 'likes' and comments and that using filters that increase warmth, exposure, and contrast also boosts engagement. Users are more likely to engage with images that depict fewer individuals compared to groups and also are more likely to engage with content that has not been watermarked, as they view this content as less original and reliable compared to user-generated content. Recently Instagram has come up with an option for users to apply for a verified account badge, however this does not guarantee every user who applies will get the verified blue tick. The motives for using Instagram among young people are mainly to look at posts, particularly for the sake of social interactions and recreation. In contrast, the level of agreement expressed in creating Instagram posts was lower, which demonstrates that Instagram's emphasis on visual communication is widely accepted by young people in social communication.  Impact = Awards  Instagram was the runner-up for \\"Best Mobile App\\" at the 2010 TechCrunch Crunchies in January 2011. In May 2011, Fast Company listed CEO Kevin Systrom at number 66 in \\"The 100 Most Creative People in Business in 2011\\". In June 2011, Inc. included co- founders Systrom and Krieger in its 2011 \\"30 Under 30\\" list. Instagram won \\"Best Locally Made App\\" in the SF Weekly Web Awards in September 2011. 7x7Magazine's September 2011 issue featured Systrom and Krieger on the cover of their \\"The Hot 20 2011\\" issue. In December 2011, Apple Inc. named Instagram the \\"App of the Year\\" for 2011. In 2015, Instagram was named No. 1 by Mashable on its list of \\"The 100 best iPhone apps of all time,\\" noting Instagram as \\"one of the most influential social networks in the world.\\"Mashable.com \\"The 100 best iPhone apps of all time\\" Published December 8, 2015. Retrieved December 10, 2015. Instagram was listed among Times \\"50 Best Android Applications for 2013\\" list. Mental health In May 2017, a survey conducted by the United Kingdom's Royal Society for Public Health, featuring 1,479 people aged 14‚Äì24, asking them to rate social media platforms depending on anxiety, depression, loneliness, bullying and body image, concluded that Instagram was the \\"worst for young mental health\\". Some have suggested it may contribute to digital dependence, whist this same survey noticed its positive effects, including self-expression, self-identity, and community building. In response to the survey, Instagram stated that \\"Keeping Instagram a safe and supportive place for young people was a top priority\\". The company filters out the reviews and accounts. If some of the accounts violate Instagram's community guidelines, it will take action, which could include banning them. In 2017, researchers from Harvard University and University of Vermont demonstrated a machine learning tool that successfully outperformed general practitioners' diagnostic success rate for depression. The tool used color analysis, metadata components, and face detection of users' feeds. Throughout 2019, Instagram began to test the hiding of like counts for posts made by its users. = Negative comments = In response to abusive and negative comments on users' photos, Instagram has made efforts to give users more control over their posts and accompanying comments field. In July 2016, it announced that users would be able to turn off comments for their posts, as well as control the language used in comments by inputting words they consider offensive, which will ban applicable comments from showing up. After the July 2016 announcement, the ability to ban specific words began rolling out early August to celebrities, followed by regular users in September. In December, the company began rolling out the abilities for users to turn off the comments and, for private accounts, remove followers. In September 2017, the company announced that public users would be able to limit who can comment on their content, such as only their followers or people they follow. At the same time, it updated its automated comment filter to support additional languages. In June 2017, Instagram announced that it would automatically attempt to filter offensive, harassing, and \\"spammy\\" comments by default. The system is built using a Facebook-developed deep learning algorithm known as DeepText (first implemented on the social network to detect spam comments), which utilizes natural-language processing techniques, and can also filter by user-specified keywords. In July 2019, the service announced that it would introduce a system to proactively detect problematic comments and encourage the user to reconsider their comment, as well as allowing users the ability to \\"restrict\\" others' abilities to communicate with them, citing that younger users felt the existing block system was too much of an escalation.  Culture  On August 9, 2012, English musician Ellie Goulding released a new music video for her song \\"Anything Could Happen.\\" The video only contained fan-submitted Instagram photographs that used various filters to represent words or lyrics from the song, and over 1,200 different photographs were submitted. Censorship and restricted content According to a Facebook spokesperson, on January 11, 2020, Instagram and its parent company Facebook are picking up posts \\"that voice support for slain Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani to comply with US sanctions\\". Illicit drugs Instagram has been the subject of criticism due to users publishing images of drugs they are selling on the platform. In 2013, the BBC discovered that users, mostly located in the United States, were posting images of drugs they were selling, attaching specific hashtags, and then completing transactions via instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp. Corresponding hashtags have been blocked as part of the company's response and a spokesperson engaged with the BBC explained: > Instagram has a clear set of rules about what is and isn't allowed on the > site. We encourage people who come across illegal or inappropriate content > to report it to us using the built-in reporting tools next to every photo, > video or comment, so we can take action. People can't buy things on > Instagram, we are simply a place where people share photos and videos. However, new incidents of illegal drug trade have occurred in the aftermath of the 2013 revelation, with Facebook, Instagram's parent company, asking users who come across such content to report the material, at which time a \\"dedicated team\\" reviews the information. In 2019, Facebook announced that influencers are no longer able to post any vape, tobacco products, and weapons promotions on Facebook and Instagram. Women's bodies In October 2013, Instagram deleted the account of Canadian photographer Petra Collins after she posted a photo of herself in which a very small area of pubic hair was visible above the top of her bikini bottom. Collins claimed that the account deletion was unfounded because it did not break any of Instagram's terms and conditions. Audra Schroeder of The Daily Dot further wrote that \\"Instagram's terms of use state users can't post \\"pornographic or sexually suggestive photos,\\" but who actually gets to decide that? You can indeed find more sexually suggestive photos on the site than Collins', where women show the side of \\"femininity\\" the world is \\"used to\\" seeing and accepting.\\" Nick Drewe of The Daily Beast wrote a report the same month focusing on hashtags that users are unable to search for, including #sex, #bubblebutt, and #ballsack, despite allowing #faketits, #gunsforsale and #sexytimes, calling the discrepancy \\"nonsensical and inconsistent\\". Similar incidents occurred in January 2015, when Instagram deleted Australian fashion agency Sticks and Stones Agency's account because of a photograph including pubic hair sticking out of bikini bottoms, and March 2015, when artist and poet Rupi Kaur's photos of menstrual blood on clothing were removed, prompting a rallying post on her Facebook and Tumblr accounts with the text \\"We will not be censored\\", gaining over 11,000 shares. The incidents have led to a #FreetheNipple campaign, aimed at challenging Instagram's removal of photos displaying women's nipples. Although Instagram has not made many comments on the campaign, an October 2015 explanation from CEO Kevin Systrom highlighted Apple's content guidelines for apps published through its App Store, including Instagram, in which apps must designate the appropriate age ranking for users, with the app's current rating being 12+ years of age. However, this statement has also been called into question due to other apps with more explicit content allowed on the store, the lack of consequences for men exposing their bodies on Instagram, and for inconsistent treatment of what constitutes inappropriate exposure of the female body.  Censorship by countries  Instagram is the most popular social networking site in Iran (in red), also the only country where this is the case. Censorship of Instagram has occurred in several different countries. =China= Instagram has been blocked by China following the 2014 Hong Kong protests because a lot of videos and photos are posted. Hong Kong and Macau were not affected as they are special administrative regions of China. =Turkey= Turkey is also known for its strict Internet censorship and periodically blocks social media including Instagram. =North Korea= A few days after a fire incident that happened in the Koryo Hotel in North Korea on June 11, 2015, authorities began to block Instagram to prevent photos of the incident from being spread out. Criticism= Security  In August 2017, reports surfaced that a bug in Instagram's developer tools had allowed \\"one or more individuals\\" to gain access to the contact information, specifically email addresses and phone numbers, of several high-profile verified accounts, including its most followed user, Selena Gomez. The company said in a statement that it had \\"fixed the bug swiftly\\" and was running an investigation. However, the following month, more details emerged, with a group of hackers selling contact information online, with the affected number of accounts in the \\"millions\\" rather than the previously-assumed limitation on verified accounts. Hours after the hack, a searchable database was posted online, charging $10 per search. The Daily Beast was provided with a sample of the affected accounts, and could confirm that, while many of the email addresses could be found with a Google search in public sources, some did not return relevant Google search results and thus were from private sources. The Verge wrote that cybersecurity firm RepKnight had found contact information for multiple actors, musicians, and athletes, and singer Selena Gomez's account was used by the hackers to post naked photos of her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber. The company admitted that \\"we cannot determine which specific accounts may have been impacted\\", but believed that \\"it was a low percentage of Instagram accounts\\", though TechCrunch stated in its report that six million accounts were affected by the hack, and that \\"Instagram services more than 700 million accounts; six million is not a small number\\". In 2019, Apple pulled an app that let users stalk people on Instagram by scraping accounts and collecting data. Content ownership On December 17, 2012, Instagram announced a change to its Terms of Service policy, adding the following sentence: There was no option for users to opt out of the changed Terms of Service without deleting their accounts before the new policy went into effect on January 16, 2013. The move garnered severe criticism from users, prompting Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom to write a blog post one day later, announcing that they would \\"remove\\" the offending language from the policy. Citing misinterpretations about its intention to \\"communicate that we'd like to experiment with innovative advertising that feels appropriate on Instagram\\", Systrom also stated that it was \\"our mistake that this language is confusing\\" and that \\"it is not our intention to sell your photos\\". Furthermore, he wrote that they would work on \\"updated language in the terms to make sure this is clear\\". The policy change and its backlash caused competing photo services to use the opportunity to \\"try to lure users away\\" by promoting their privacy- friendly services, and some services experienced substantial gains in momentum and user growth following the news. On December 20, Instagram announced that the advertising section of the policy would be reverted to its original October 2010 version. The Verge wrote about that policy as well, however, noting that the original policy gives the company right to \\"place such advertising and promotions on the Instagram Services or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content\\", meaning that \\"Instagram has always had the right to use your photos in ads, almost any way it wants. We could have had the exact same freakout last week, or a year ago, or the day Instagram launched\\". The policy update also introduced an arbitration clause, which remained even after the language pertaining to advertising and user content had been modified. Algorithm and design changes In April 2016, Instagram began rolling out a change to the order of photos visible in a user's timeline, shifting from a strictly chronological order to one determined by an algorithm. Instagram said the algorithm was designed so that users would see more of the photos by users that they liked, but there was significant negative feedback, with many users asking their followers to turn on post notifications in order to make sure they see updates. The company wrote a tweet to users upset at the prospect of the change, but did not back down, nor provide a way to change it back. Since 2017, Instagram has employed the ability to reduce the prominence of accounts (\\"shadowbanning\\") it believes may be generating non-genuine engagement and spam (including excessive use of unneeded hashtags), preventing posts from appearing in search results and in the app's Explore section. In a now-deleted Facebook post, Instagram wrote that \\"When developing content, we recommend focusing on your business objective or goal rather than hashtags\\". Instagram has since been accused of extending the practice to censor posts under vague and inconsistent circumstances, particularly in regards to sexually suggestive material. Instagram caused the userbase to fall into outrage with the December 2018 update. They found an attempt to alter the flow of the feed from the traditional vertical scroll to emulate and piggy-back the popularity of their Instagram Stories with a horizontal scroll, by swiping left. Various backtracking statements were released explaining it as a bug, or as a test release that had been accidentally deployed to too large an audience.  Facebook acquisition as a violation of US antitrust law  Columbia Law School professor Tim Wu has given public talks explaining that Facebook's 2012 purchase of Instagram was a felony.Tim Wu: Facebook's Purchase of Instagram was a Felony, at the 2019 Aspen Ideas Festival (The Aspen Institute YouTube channel, published on June 28, 2019) A New York Post article published on February 26, 2019, reported that \\"the FTC had uncovered [a document] by a high-ranking Facebook executive who said the reason the company was buying Instagram was to eliminate a potential competitor\\".Facebook boasted of buying Instagram to kill the competition, by Josh Kosman, February 26, 2019 As Wu explains, this is a violation of US antitrust law (see monopoly). Wu stated that this document was an email directly from Mark Zuckerberg, whereas the Post article had stated that their source had declined to say whether the high-ranking executive was the CEO. The article reported that the FTC \\"has formed a task force to review \\"anticompetitive conduct\\" in the tech world amid concerns that tech companies are growing too powerful. The task force will look at \\"the full panoply of remedies\\" if it finds \\"competitive harm,\\" FTC competition bureau director Bruce Hoffman told reporters.\\" Algorithmic advertisement with a rape threat In 2016, Olivia Solon, a reporter for The Guardian, posted a screenshot to her Instagram profile of an email she had received containing threats of rape and murder towards her. The photo post had received three likes and countless comments, and in September 2017, the company's algorithms turned the photo into an advertisement visible to Solon's sister. An Instagram spokesperson apologized and told The Guardian that \\"We are sorry this happened ‚Äì it's not the experience we want someone to have. This notification post was surfaced as part of an effort to encourage engagement on Instagram. Posts are generally received by a small percentage of a person's Facebook friends\\". As noted by the technology media, the incident occurred at the same time parent company Facebook was under scrutiny for its algorithms and advertising campaigns being used for offensive and negative purposes.

It is situated in the village Haburugala in the Southern part of Sri Lanka. The purpose of the school is to guide students from Haburugala and nearby villages to understand, practice, and analyze Theravada Buddhist principals (Dharma) which Lord Buddha discovered. The school intends to produce non-violent, peaceful, well-mannered students with their ambitions to become useful people to the world. The school is maintained by the Choola Bodhi Viharaya temple in Haburugala, Bentota which is an agricultural village. The chief monk Venerable Uhan Owita Sumanasiri is the principal of the free Buddhist school since its establishment in 1987.  Charity Work  The teachers in Sri Punyarathana Dhamma School, Haburugala don't take any payment for their service as they consider it to be a service to the society and a charity work. The Buddhists who believe Theravada Buddhism, the Karma is believed. In simple terms, the Theravada Buddhists believe that the good deed with good mind result in good luck while the bad deed with bad thoughts result in bad luck. This idea seems to encourage the students to become teachers who sacrifise their valuable time for the next generation students. The school has proven its education standards in many ways. In 2008, a girl won the Island- wide Competition for the Final Grade competition in \\"Dhaham Denuma\\" (the knowledge on Buddhism). The students have won several awards in the Bentota regional competitions resulting in the first place for six consecutive years from 2004 to 2009.  Staff Members and Education  The staff consists of 18 teachers where 7 of them are holding Bachelor's degree holders in various fields such as Computer Science, Arts, Languages, Buddhism etc. The principal was a teacher and the former principal of Miriswatta Maha Vidyalaya government school, Miriswatta, Bentota before his retirement in 1998. He had obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Kelaniya. The assistant principal Venerable Uhan Owita Nagitha finished his Bachelor of Arts degree in 2008.  Problems  The problems the Dhamma school face are as follows. Due to the educational standards of the Dhamma school and the discipline constructed with well-understanding of the morals, the number of students who enter the Dhamma school increases every year. The temple rarely gets a funding from the government resulting a drop of facilities for the students. Since income of the families in the area is not equally distributed, the school takes no fee from the students. Classes are held in outdoor environment which pleases the students because of the natural Surroundings, but the classes have to be stopped whenever there is rain. Furthermore, the number of students are higher than the number of chairs and desks available. This results in a problem for the students to continue their studies. The available building facilities is not enough for the students. There are knowledged people with educational qualifications to teach Computer Science, Information Technology, even though there is neither a computer nor the required facilities. Due to high competition for available seats in Universities, students from grade 11 tends to leave the Dhamma school to participate in tuition classes required for the school curriculum.https://mpra.ub.uni- muenchen.de/31969/1/MPRA_paper_31969.pdf When it comes to grade 12, students tend to omit the final examination resulting a waste of 11 years of Dhamma education. The competition to enter to the universities can lead the students to a situation where they undergo anxiety and fear. Most of the Dhamma school teachers consider this as a social problem.

The newspaper claims to be the first exclusively digital newspaper in Latin America (\\"El primer peri√≥dico digital latinoamericano\\"). Jorge Sim√°n, of Palestinian origin and Carlos Dada, of Greek-Lebanese origin, are the founders of the newspaper. They are sons of political exiles, and they returned to El Salvador, with the purpose of starting a newspaper that would completely change Salvadoran media. Their return happened six years after the end of the Salvadoran civil war, marked by the Chapultepec Peace Accords of 1992. These agreements would guarantee greater political freedoms, and better possibilities to conduct independent journalism. Since its foundation, El Faro has been an effort to renovate the Salvadoran media, which has traditionally been dominated by conservative outlets as Telecorporaci√≥n Salvadore√±a, El Diario de Hoy and La Prensa Gr√°fica. The online newspaper has grown steadily since its creation in April 1998. Despite pressures to adapt to a commercial format, which are imposed by the Salvadoran media-industry, the editors have insisted on an alternative sort of journalism. This journalism is based on long in-depth pieces, investigative journalism and political analyses. Content is paramount to form, and this principle is explained by the flexibility of the digital format. The newspaper gives room to most of the political ideologies present in El Salvador, although the editorials and commentaries show a left-leaning, non-partisan, anti-authoritarian ideology. The online paper is published weekly, but new articles may be uploaded more frequently. According to editor Carlos Dada, \\"for the first seven years, everybody involved in the production of El Faro worked on a voluntary basis\\". He explains that when the paper first started, it was mostly based on the work of journalism students. Many of these students came from the Universidad Centroamericana \\"Jos√© Sime√≥n Ca√±as\\" and some of them were former students of Externado San Jos√©. These students have gradually become recognized professional journalists and commentators. One example is Carlos Mart√≠nez D'aubuisson, who in 2011 won the Ortega y Gasset Award. This is one of the most important international recognitions for journalists who publish in Spanish. One of the digital newspaper's founders, Carlos Dada, won the Maria Moors Cabot Prize for outstanding reporting on Latin America and the Caribbean, in September 2011. This is the oldest award in international journalism. El Faro was described as \\"a vanguard, online news website which (Carlos Dada) runs from El Salvador, a small country that is still suffering from the trauma of its decade-long civil war. El Faro means lighthouse or beacon‚Äîand that's what it is. With a limited budget, it has consistently published outstanding stories and projects‚Äîinvestigating long- ignored crimes and human rights abuses and now tracking growing drug violence throughout Central America. From its inception in 1998, El Faro has shown how digital media can overcome barriers of cost and tradition and offer honest journalism of high quality in a region where press standards are low and much of the media is highly partisan or even corrupt.\\" The newspaper has also attracted contributions from diverse recognized personalities from the Salvadoran and Latin American, academic and political environments. One of the most noteworthy pieces published by the newspaper is the exclusive interview with Captain √Ålvaro Saravia, one of the alleged assassins of Archbishop √ìscar Romero. This article was published in March 2010, exactly 30 years after this assassination took place. The newspaper normally publishes in Spanish, but occasionally some articles are available in English and French, as is the case with this interview.

SCRs are used to transfer fluids like oil, gas, injection water, etc. between the platforms and the pipelines. Description In the offshore industry the word catenary is used as an adjective or noun with a meaning wider than is its historical meaning in mathematics. Thus, an SCR that uses a rigid, steel pipe that has a considerable bending stiffness is described as a catenary. That is because in the scale of depth of the ocean, the bending stiffness of a rigid pipe has little effect on the shape of the suspended span of an SCR. The shape assumed by the SCR is controlled mainly by weight, buoyancy and hydrodynamic forces due to currents and waves. The shape of the SCR is well approximated by stiffened catenary equationsLangner, Carl G., Suspended Pipe Span Relationships, OMAE Symposium, pp 552-558, New Orleans, Feb 1984.. In preliminary considerations, in spite of using conventional, rigid steel pipe, the shape of the SCR can be also approximated with the use of ideal catenary equationsWajnikonis, Christopher J., Robinson, Roy, Interactive Deepwater Riser Design, Analyses and Installation Methodology, IBP 42400, 2000 Rio Oil & Gas Expo and Conference, 16‚Äì19 October 2000, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil., when some further loss of accuracy is acceptable. Ideal catenary equations are used historically to describe the shape of a chain suspended between points in space. A chain line has by definition a zero bending stiffness and those described with the ideal catenary equations use infinitesimally short links. SCRs were invented by Dr. Carl G. Langner P.E., NAE who described an SCR together with a flexible joint used to accommodate angular deflections of the top region of the SCR relative a support platform, as the platform and the SCR move in currents and wavesLangner, Carl G., Elastomeric Swivel Support Assembly for Catenary Riser, US Patent No. 5,269,629, Dec 14, 1993, filed Jul 29, 1991. https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/99/98/ed/70530d77647e2c/US5269629.pdf. SCRs use thousands of feet of long unsupported pipe spans. Complex dynamics, hydrodynamics, including vortex induced vibrations (VIVs) and physics of pipe interactions with the seabed are involved. Those are tough on materials used to build the SCR pipe. Dr. Langner had carried out years of analytical and design work before an application for his US patent was filed. That work started before 1969 and it was reflected in internal Shell documents, which are confidential, but a patent on an early 'Bare Foot' SCR design was issuedLangner, Carl G., Visser, R.C., US Patent 3,669,691, Method of Connecting Flowlines to a Platform, filed Feb 8, 1971, issued Oct 24, 1972. https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/23/89/6d/084cd5a1d531fa/US3699691.pdf. VIVs are predominantly controlled with a use of devices attached to the SCR pipe. Those can be for example VIV suppression devices, like helicoidal strakes or fairingsAllen, D.W., Lee, L., Henning, D.L., Fairings versus Helical Strakes for Suppression of Vortex-Induced Vibration: Technical comparisons, OTC 19373, Ocean Technology Conference, May 5-8, 2008, Houston, Texas, USA. https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/OTC-19373-MS that considerably reduce VIV amplitudes Vandiver, J.

The rigid pipe of the SCR forms a catenary between its hang-off point on the floating or rigid platform, and the seabedLangner, Carl G., Fatigue Life Improvement of Steel Catenary Risers due to Self-trenching at the Touchdown Point, OTC 15104, Ocean Technology Conference, 5-8 May 2003, Houston, Texas, USA. https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/OTC-15104-MS. A free-hanging SCR assumes a shape roughly similar to the letter 'J'. A catenary of a Steel Lazy Wave Riser (SLWR) consists in fact of at least three catenary segments. The top and the seabed segments of the catenary have negative submerged weight, and their curvatures 'bulge' towards the seabed. The middle segment has buoyant material attached along its entire length, so that the ensemble of the steel pipe and the buoyancy is positively buoyant. Accordingly, the curvature of the buoyant segment 'bulges' upwards (inverted catenary), and its shape can also be well approximated with the same stiffened or ideal catenary equations. The positively and negatively buoyant segments are tangent to each other at the points where they join. The overall catenary shape of the SLWR has inflection points at those locations. SLWRs were first installed on a turret moored FPSO offshore Brazil (BC-10, Shell) in 2009,Wajnikonis, Christopher J., Leverette, Steve, Improvements in Dynamic Loading of Ultra Deepwater Catenary Risers, OTC 20180, Offshore Technology Conference, 4‚Äì7 May 2009, Houston, Texas, USA. https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/OTC-20180-MS even though Lazy Wave configuration flexible risers had been in a wide use for several decades beforehand. The deepest application of Lazy Wave SCRs (SLWRs) is at present on the Stones turret-moored FPSO (Shell), which is moored in 9,500 feet water depth in the Gulf of MexicoWebb, C.M., van Vugt, M.,Offshore Construction ‚Äì Installing the World's Deepest FPSO Development, OTC 27655, Offshore Technology Conference, May 1-4, 2017, Houston, Texas, USA. https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/OTC-27655-MS. The Stones FPSO turret features a disconnectable buoy, so that the vessel with the crew can be disconnected from the buoy supporting the SLWRs, and moved to a suitable shelter before an arrival of a hurricane. The SCR pipe and a short segment of pipe lying on the seabed use 'dynamic' pipe, i.e. steel pipe having slightly greater wall thickness than the pipeline wall thickness, in order to sustain dynamic bending and steel material fatigue associated in the touch-down zone of the SCR. Beyond that the SCR is typically extended with a rigid pipeline, but a use of a flexible pipeline is also feasible. The risers are typically 8-12 inches in diameter and operate at a pressure of 2000-5000 psi. Designs beyond those ranges of pipe sizes and operating pressures are also feasible. Free hanging SCRs were first used by Shell on the Auger tension leg platform(TLP)Phifer, K.H., Kopp, F., Swanson, R.C., Allen, D.W., Langner, C.G., Design and Installation of Auger Steel Catenary Risers, OTC 7620, Offshore Technology Conference, May 1994, Houston, Texas, USA. https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/OTC-7620-MS in 1994 which was moored in 872 m of water. Proving to Shell that the SCR concept was technically sound for use on the Auger TLP was a major achievement of Dr. Carl G. Langner. It was a technological leap. The acceptance of the SCR concept by the entire Offshore Industry followed relatively quickly. SCRs have performed reliably on oil and gas fields all over the world since their first Auger installation.

Excavations The area of in the Jordan Valley was first excavated in 1962 by Jean Perrot. The deposits on site were deep and divided up into six distinct layers of occupation. These have been divided into PPNB aceramic during levels six to three, with later Neolithic and Chalcolithic, Yarmukian and Wadi Rabah cultures in levels two and one. Construction Buildings in the earlier stages had stone, paved or plastered floors made of mud bricks on stone foundations with remains of hearths and other stone structures. The north walls of buildings contained a plastered niche, a feature found in a similar room in Jericho. The PPNB levels also revealed an unusual circular courtyard structure with rooms radiating out from it and a large platform with channels cut in it associated with a pebble lined trough, presumably used for craft purposes. The Yarmoukian phase continued with round buildings which developed into rectangular ones in the Rabah phase. A major break in settlement was detected between levels three and two, where the early levels were covered over with sandy soil. Culture Various flint tools and arrowheads were recovered from the site. Arrowheads had distinctive tangs (some barbed) with wings and pointed shoulders, some were diamond or leaf shaped and a few were notched. Finely denticulated sickle blades were found in large numbers with other tools including end scrapers, blades, burins and borers. One piece of obsidian was found in level six that originated from the same place as a piece from El Khiam. Grinding tools were also found including pestle and mortars of basalt or limestone, polishers, rubbers and grooved stones. Stoneware vessels were found along with a few greenstone beads. The site was also notable for finds of clay figurines of males, females and animals. Dating Radio-carbon dating of the site had large stated errors due to problematic dating materials but gave dates between ca. 7210 and 5420 BC. These provide a vague suggestion of the age of the site. Typological comparisons have been made of various artifacts highlighting a certain regional variation with more elaborate design arrowheads and less pressure flaking. This equates generally with the PPNB stages of Jericho and Beidha suggesting that occupations overlapped with these sites and a date of occupation during the middle and late 7th millennium BC.

He also held the title of a Count of Kladsko (K≈Çodzko), though he never actually ruled the county. From 1545 to 1560 he was Prince-Bishop of Brandenburg.  Life  Joachim was a member of the M√ºnsterberg branch of the Bohemian noble Podiebrad dynasty, descendants of King George of Podƒõbrady (1420‚Äì1471), who had acquired K≈Çodzko Land in 1454 as well as the Silesian duchy of M√ºnsterberg two years later. His son Duke Henry I (1448‚Äì1498), Joachim's grandfather, also received the Duchy of Oels from King Vladislaus Jagiellon in 1495. Joachim's parents were Duke Charles I of M√ºnsterberg-Oels (1476‚Äì1536) and his consort Anna of Sagan (d. 1541), a daughter of the Piast duke Jan II the Mad of ≈ªaga≈Ñ. His father initially ruled jointly with his elder brothers George and Albert, who nevertheless died without male heirs in 1502 and 1511. He had great influence at the Prague court of King Vladislaus and his son Louis, and he played a vital role in the election of the Habsburg archduke Ferdinand I as King of Bohemia in 1526. Though still adhering to the Catholic faith, his father had Joachim and his younger brother educated from 1515 to 1517 by the Lutheran reformer Johann Hess, who at the time held a canonicate in Nysa. Coat of arms of Srebrna G√≥ra, granted in 1536 After the death of their father in 1536, the brothers Joachim, Henry II, John and George II initially ruled M√ºnsterberg jointly. In a joint deed dated 25 June 1535, they awarded the city of Srebrna G√≥ra (Silberberg) in the Sudetes mountains, which belonged to the M√ºnsterberg duchy, the status of free mining town. Unlike their father, Joachim and his brothers officially implemented the Lutheran faith. In 1537, they expelled the Catholic priests from M√ºnsterberg (Ziƒôbice) and appointed a Lutheran vicar. In the same year, the Hohenzollern elector Joachim II of Brandenburg promised Joachim in Bautzen the bishopric of either Lebus or Brandenburg, when one of these would be available. In return, Joachim and his brothers waived their claims on the Silesian northwestern lands of Krosno which had been incorporated into the Neumark territory of Brandenburg. In 1542, Joachim and his brothers pledged the heavily indebted Duchy of M√ºnsterberg to their uncle Duke Frederick II of Legnica. John continued to rule the Duchy of Oels and Henry II ruled until 1548 part of the Duchy of Bernstadt. Against the opposition of the chapter of the cathedral, which revolted against the enforcement of the Reformation, Elector Joachim II, who had converted to the Lutheran faith in 1539, appointed ‚Äì in accordance with his promise made in 1537 ‚Äì Joachim of M√ºnsterberg, who now openly turned to Lutheranism, as bishop of the Brandenburg diocese on 6 November 1545. With this appointment, Joachim also received the title of an Imperial prince, and, in this respect, was equal in rank to the Brandenburg elector. In 1560, however, he abdicated the secular rule of the bishopric, in favour of the elector's son, prince John George. After Elector Joachim's death in 1571, the secular rule of the bishopric was incorporated into the electorate. Joachim died in Wroc≈Çaw (Breslau), aged 59. The Duchy of M√ºnsterberg reverted as a ceased fief to the Bohemian Crown upon the death of Joachim's nephew Duke Charles Christopher in 1569. The Oels branch of the Podiebrad family ruled their duchy until 1647.

As publisher of The Sacramento Bee (now The McClatchy Company) from their father's death in 1883, McClatchy co-owned the paper with his brother Charles K. McClatchy until 1923. After leaving the newspaper business, he became a leading figure in the anti-Japanese movement in California and formed key exclusionary groups to lobby for alien land laws and race-based limits on immigration and naturalization. Early life and career McClatchy was the son of the prominent nineteenth-century publisher James McClatchy, who was hired by John Rollins Ridge, founder of the Sacramento Bee (known as the Daily Bee when he became editor in 1857). \\"V.S.\\" graduated from Santa Clara College in 1877, and after the elder McClatchy's death in 1883 he took on joint ownership of the Bee with his brother. \\"C.K.\\" served as the editor, while Valentine took on the role of publisher. As early as 1915, he began writing about the menace posed by Japanese immigrants, and by 1919 he had largely retired from the paper, turning his efforts instead to publishing a series of anti-Japanese pamphlets. He officially left the Bee in 1923, when C.K. bought him out to obtain sole control of the company. Anti- immigration lobbying China opened migration into California from Asia, this increased the nativism within the United States which culminated into the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. With more Asian people coming at the turn of the century adversaries arose to counter the migration of the Asian people. The first exclusionary league that arose was the Japanese and Korean Exclusion league. With a common and vested interest in keeping the asiatic peoples from immigrating into America. Two years later, the group renamed themselves to the Asiatic Exclusion League (AEL), the AEL‚Äôs purpose was the same as its predecessor the exclusionary group only expanded their nativist goals to affect other Asiatic peoples. The AEL‚Äôs focus was primarily based upon limiting Asiatic migration all together, this was done through amending some of the existing laws like the 1913 California Alien Land Law Act' with revisions that made it harder for Asiatic people to reside in California. McClatchy was able to line himself up with nativist groups and take members from the AEL and Native Sons of the Golden West', and The Japanese Exclusion League to create an exclusionary group that not only focused on Asiatic Immigration but, also on Mexican and Filipino immigration. The California Joint Immigration Committee (CJIC) formed in 1925 with McClatchy serving as the Secretary of the CJIC. McClatchy was able to surround himself with prominent Californian politicians at the time, such as Attorney General Ulysses S. Webb, Governor Hiram Johnson and Senator James D. Phelan. The CJIC through McClatchy was also able to get aide from other organizations, one of the organizations that assisted the CJIC was the California State Federation of Labor. McClatchy as the secretary was then able to write and distribute pamphlets published by the CJIC. The pamphlets focused on guarding immigration from countries that were not anglo-european origin. McClatchy was able to formulate arguments that would only benefit the eugenics belief that had been gaining popularity since the 1917 Immigration Act. With a new purpose of guarding the Immigration gates against all immigrants the CJIC, through McClatchy, began to adopt precedents through court cases to help create a hierarchy of races. Attempting to use the Thind and Ozawa cases to help differentiate white from the ‚Äúother.‚Äù These cases were able to distinguish asiatic people as a race other than white, however, with immigration from Mexico seemingly increasing post-war; McClatchy was adamant about adopting a test-case for Mexicans to gain a classification of their race to ensure they would not be able to be exempt from the 1924 Immigration Act. In 1937, he lobbied to strip Kibei, Japanese Americans born in the United States who were sent to Japan to study or visit family for an extended time, of their citizenship if they had lived in Japan for more than a year. He died of a heart condition on May 15, 1938.

Broughton was historically a village, but has now become a suburb of the new town of Milton Keynes. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands on the northeast periphery of Milton Keynes, between the A4146 and A5130 roads. It is listed at Grade I because of its \\"remarkable series\\" of medieval wall paintings. History The church was built in the 14th and 15th centuries. It was restored in the 19th century, when the chancel was rebuilt. In 1849 a series of medieval wall paintings were discovered that had been covered in plaster for 300 years. These were restored in the 1930s by Professor Tristram. The church was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 1 August 1987. Architecture=Exterior St Lawrence's is constructed in stone, and has lead roofs with plain parapets. Its plan consists of a nave without aisles, a south porch, a chancel, and a west tower. The tower is in three stages with diagonal buttresses and an embattled parapet. On the south side of the church are three three-light windows. To the west of the porch is a 14th-century window with reticulated tracery, and to the east of the porch are two Perpendicular windows. On the north side of the church is a staircase to the rood loft. Interior The wall paintings in the nave date from about 1400. On the south wall is a depiction of Saint George and the dragon: Saint George lost his head in the 15th century when the ceiling was lowered. On the north wall there are a doom painting and a Piet√†; these are designed as a warning against swearing. There are also paintings of Saint Helena and Saint Eligius. The pulpit dates from the late 17th or early 18th century. The memorials include a series of black marble stones under the altar, fragments of brasses from the 14th and 15th centuries, and a 17th-century wall monument. The stained glass in the east and south windows of the chancel by Kempe dates from 1894, and that in a south window in the nave dating from 1864 is by A. Gibbs. There is a ring of four bells, but these are no longer ringable. The oldest two were cast in about 1470 by William Chamberlain; the others were cast in 1622 by James Keene, and in 1655 by Anthony Chandler.

Williams, FAcSS (born 1961) is a British sociologist. He is Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the University of Warwick. Biography Simon Williams completed his doctoral thesis on the sociological dimensions of chronic respiratory illness and disability in 1990 at Royal Holloway and Bedford New College, University of London. He then worked as a Research Fellow at the University of Kent in the Centre for Health Services Studies from 1990-1992 before moving to a full-time lectureship in Sociology at the University of Warwick in 1992, where he has been ever since, becoming a full Professor of Sociology in 2006 and Emeritus Professor in October 2019. Research Williams' has researched a wide range of sociological topics and interdisciplinary issues during his career, including the body, emotion/affect, health and illness, pain, sleep, pharmaceuticals, and most recently the social shaping/social implications of neuroscience, with particular reference to issues of cognitive enhancement. He also has newly emerging research interests in new digital health technologies, and the challenges of complexity in the social sciences today. The sociology and politics of sleep Perhaps the most innovative aspect of Williams' work to date has been his contribution to the newly emerging sociology of sleep: a topic which until quite recently has received relatively little attention within sociology or the social sciences and humanities in general. His book Sleep and Society, for example, may be read as an early attempt to sketch the sociological dimensions and dynamics of sleep, including socio-cultural and historical variability in how, when, where and with whom we sleep; changing ideas, meanings and values associated with sleep through time, culture and context; the contested nature and status of sleep rights and sleep roles in the 24/7 society; the embodied and embedded nature of sleep in everyday/night life; the social patterning and social organisation of sleep; and the medicalisation of sleep. Further collaborative research has also been conducted on the social construction of sleep in the news, and sleep deprivation as a hidden dimension of domestic violence. His latest book, The Politics of Sleep, examines the increasingly 'politicised' nature of sleep today as a matter of controversy, contestation and concern, thereby linking sleep to prevailing socio-political discourses and debates concerning rights, risks and responsibilities in the late modern age and associated questions of citizenship, enterprise and enhancement in neo-liberal times. Sleep indeed, Williams argues, is another vital part of the 'politics of life' and the 'governance of bodies' today. The social sciences and humanities too, Williams suggests, are implicated in these very processes and dynamics, thereby further profiling, promoting or problematising and hence politicising sleep, both inside and outside the academy, the laboratory and the clinic. This for example, includes recent sociological research on: gender, sleep and the life course; the social and health patterning of sleep quality and duration, and; the medicalisation of sleep. Comparative historical and cross-cultural research is also now shedding further valuable new light on a range of sleep- related matters such as the transformation of sleep science; sleep in (pre)industrial times, and; sleep and night-time in Asia and the West. All in all this adds up to a rich and vibrant new interdisciplinary area of research on 'sleep, culture and society' that complements and extends existing work in sleep science, sleep medicine and cognate fields of inquiry. These issues have recently been further discussed and debated online in 'Somatosphere' with the American medical anthropologist Matthew Wolf-Meyer. Honours In September 2014, Williams was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences.  Selected bibliography =Books * * * * * * * * * * * * Preview. * Meloni, M, Williams, S.J. and Martin P.

Best known for its Adams Best Vanilla, it also sells product under the Adams Spice, Adams Extract, Adams Reserve and Culinary Tonight brands. In addition, Adams spices, extract and seasoning blends are found in many private label brands around the country as well as being used to season many commercially produced meat and food products.Adams Extract & Spice LLC  Company profile from Hoover'shttp://www.adamsextract.com Founded in 1888, Adams is one of the oldest continuously operated companies in Texas and one of the oldest spice and extract companies in the United States. History John Anderson Adams, began making and selling extracts in Michigan in 1888. In 1905, he moved the family to Beeville, Texas. His wife was unhappy with the quality of the vanilla extract products available because she felt like they either baked or froze out. Mr. Adams decided to formulate one for her. When his wife tried the product, she was delighted and John replied, \\"Well, that's old man Adam's best.\\" His vanilla extract became known as Adams Best Vanilla. Mr. Adams, along with the help of his sons, Fred and Don, began to produce, package, and sell the vanilla extract door-to-door with a complete money back guarantee. After being the first to be awarded a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from University of Texas at Austin, Fred purchased the company from his father and relocated the production headquarters to Austin, Texas. In 1922, he built a two-story building downtown and continued production of the extracts and colors. Adams Extract is credited for having brought the Red Velvet Cake to kitchens across America during the time of the Great Depression by being one of the first to sell red food color and other flavor extracts with the use of point-of-sale posters and tear-off recipe cards. His son, John G. Adams, Sr., worked in the family business throughout his childhood, and after having received his BA in Chemistry from the University of Texas at Austin, he returned and helped expand the lines produced. In 1947, he designed and built the assorted food color 4-pack line that is still sold today. In 1955, the company built a new plant, designed by the famous architecture firm Lundgren and Maurer on I-35. This plant helped aid in the expansion of the products to include spice lines in 1959. During this time, another important person played a big role in the company's recipe development, Betty Adams. Her name can be found on many of the original recipes boasted by the company including the \\"Adams 75th Anniversary Poundcake\\" or more commonly known as the Five Flavor Cake. In 2000, architecture students at The University of Texas at Austin helped the Adams Extract Company design a new manufacturing campus at Buda, Texas, south of Austin. The Adams Extract building continued production in Austin, Texas, under direction of John G. Adams, Sr., from the Adams family until 2002. In that year, the company was purchased and relocated its facility to Gonzales, Texas. It is still producing a full line of spices, and of course, the Adams Best Vanilla and food colouring line. In 2009, the movie Extract (film) was released and based on the childhood memories creator and director Mike Judge had of the Adams Extract Plant in Austin, Texas. In mid- July 2011, Adams Best Vanilla, six other extracts, and food colors were added as a feature product in the popular Apple iTunes app, \\"Cupcakes!\\". In January 2013, Adams Extract & Spice, was awarded the Texas Treasure Business Award, nominated by Senator Glenn Hegar and Representative John Kuempel. Created in the 79th Texas Legislature in 2005 with passage of Senate Bill 920, the program recognizes the accomplishments of Texas businesses that have provided employment opportunities and support to the state's economy for at least 50 years and pays tribute to the state's well-established businesses and their exceptional historical contributions toward the state's economic growth and prosperity.

History  The vocalist/songwriter/programmer Wally van Middendorp formed the band in 1978, taking the name from a primitive Korg drum machine, the Mini Pops. Minny Pops, which van Middendorp originally intended to be a project for just three performances, had an initial lineup of van Middendorp, bass guitarist Frans Hagenaars, guitarist Peter Mertens, and two dancers, including van Middendorp's older brother, Rob. The band's first commercially released recording was the \\"Kojak\\" singleKellman, Andy, \\"The Minny Pops Biography\\", AllMusic, retrieved 17 July 2011 (b/w \\"Footsteps\\" and \\"Nervous\\") (Plurex 005), issued in 1979 on Plurex, the independent label founded by van Middendorp in 1978. Minny Pops' first full-length album, Drastic Measures, Drastic Movement (Plurex 900) was released in 1979. After opening for Joy Division in Eindhoven and Den Haag in January 1980, the band was brought to the attention of Factory Records by Rob Gretton, Joy Division's manager. Minny Pops' first single for Factory, \\"Dolphin's Spurt\\"/\\"Goddess\\" (FAC 31) was produced by Martin Hannett and recorded at Strawberry Studios in Stockport. It reached number 23 in the UK Independent Chart.Lazell, Barry (1998) Indie Hits 1980-1989, Cherry Red Books, , p. 149 Further releases for the label included the single \\"Secret Story\\"/\\"Island\\" (FAC 57), the flexi single \\"Een Kus\\" (FACBN 13 - later reissued as 7\\" vinyl on LTM Recordings with \\"Son\\" on the B-side), the single \\"Time\\"/\\"Lights\\" (FBN 11) and the full-length album (FACBN 15), which was released by Factory Benelux in 1982. Sparks in a Dark Room The band's first live appearance in England was at the Beach Club, a Manchester venue associated with Factory. They went on to share further bills with Joy Division and, after Ian Curtis' death, New Order, as well as appearing with A Certain Ratio, Scritti Politti, the Au Pairs and Comsat Angels. In 1980, Minny Pops undertook a seven-date North American tour during which they played with Suicide in New York. Curiously, the original line-up of Minny Pops never performed live in Brussels, despite their close association with the Factory Benelux label, based in that city. In 1980, they became the first Dutch band to be invited to record a Peel session for BBC Radio. A line-up of van Middendorp, Dekker, van Zoeren and Walhof recorded \\"Dolphin's Spurt\\", \\"Mono\\", \\"Jets\\" and \\"Ice Cube Wall\\"; the session was broadcast on 12 November 1980.\\"Keeping It Peel\\", BBC Radio 1 Minny Pops' final live performances were in December 1981. Van Middendorp and Dekker subsequently recorded two dance singles for Factory under the name Streetlife. Between 2003 and 2004, the bulk of the Minny Pops studio back catalogue was issued on remastered CD by LTM. In November 2011, van Middendorp told an interviewer with the Dutch national public broadcaster VPRO's 3Voor12 programme that Minny Pops would perform their first gigs in 30 years in early 2012, and that a live CD/DVD package, Standstill to Motion,Raggett, Ned, \\", AllMusic, retrieved 28 February 2012 would appear via LTM in January 2012.

The Silent Way is a language-teaching method created by Caleb Gattegno that makes extensive use of silence as a teaching method. Gattegno introduced the method in 1963, in his book Teaching Foreign Languages in Schools: The Silent Way., available as . Gattegno was critical of mainstream language education at the time, and he based the method on his general theories of education rather than on existing language pedagogy. It is usually regarded as an \\"alternative\\" language-teaching method; Cook groups it under \\"other styles\\", Richards groups it under \\"alternative approaches and methods\\" and Jin & Cortazzi group it under \\"Humanistic or Alternative Approaches\\". The method emphasizes learner autonomy and active student participation. Silence is used as a tool to achieve this goal; the teacher uses a mixture of silence and gestures to focus students' attention, to elicit responses from them, and to encourage them to correct their own errors. Pronunciation is seen as fundamental to the method, with a great deal of time spent on it each lesson. The Silent Way uses a structural syllabus and concentrates on teaching a small number of functional and versatile words. Translation and rote repetition are avoided, and the language is usually practiced in meaningful contexts. Evaluation is carried out by observation, and the teacher may never set a formal test. One of the hallmarks of the Silent Way is the use of Cuisenaire rods, which can be used for anything from introducing simple commands (\\"Take two red rods and give them to her.\\") to representing objects such as clocks and floor plans. The method also draws on color associations to help teach pronunciation; there is a sound-color chart which is used to teach the language sounds, colored word charts which are used for work on sentences, and colored Fidel charts which are used to teach spelling. While the Silent Way is not widely used in its original form, its ideas have been influential, especially in the teaching of pronunciation.  Background and principles  Caleb Gattegno, creator of the Silent Way. Gattegno was an outsider to language education when Teaching Foreign Languages in Schools was first published in 1963. The book conspicuously lacked the names of most prominent language educators and linguists of the time, and for the decade following its publication Gattegno's works were only rarely cited in language education books and journals. He was previously a designer of mathematics and reading programmes, and the use of color charts and colored Cuisenaire rods in the Silent Way grew directly out of this experience. Gattegno was openly sceptical of the role the linguistic theory of his time had in language teaching. He felt that linguistic studies \\"may be a specialization, [that] carry with them a narrow opening of one's sensitivity and perhaps serve very little towards the broad end in mind\\"., cited in . The Silent Way was conceived as a special case of Gattegno's broader educational principles, which he had developed to solve general problems in learning, and which he had previously applied to the teaching of mathematics and of spelling in the mother tongue. Broadly, these principles are: # Teachers should concentrate on how students learn, not on how to teach # Imitation and drill are not the primary means by which students learn # Learning consists of trial and error, deliberate experimentation, suspending judgement, and revising conclusions # In learning, learners draw on everything that they already know, especially their native language # The teacher must not interfere with the learning process These principles situate the Silent Way in the tradition of discovery learning, that sees learning as a creative problem-solving activity.  Design and goals  The general goal of the Silent Way is to help beginning-level students gain basic fluency in the target language, with the ultimate aim being near-native language proficiency and good pronunciation. An important part of this ability is being able to use the language for self-expression; students should be able to express their thoughts, feelings, and needs in the target language. In order to help them achieve this, teachers emphasize self-reliance. Students are encouraged to actively explore the language, and to develop their own 'inner criteria' as to what is linguistically acceptable. The role of the teacher is that of technician or engineer. The teacher's task is to focus the students' attention, and provide exercises to help them develop language facility; however, to ensure their self-reliance, the teacher should only help the students as much as is strictly necessary. As Gattegno says, \\"The teacher works with the student; the student works on the language.\\" For example, teachers will often give students time to correct their own mistakes before giving them the answer to a question. Teachers also avoid praise or criticism, as it can discourage students from developing self-reliance. Gattegno's original sound-color chart for English. This type of chart is used right from the beginning stages to teach pronunciation and word stress. In the Silent Way students are seen as bringing a vast amount of experience and knowledge with them to the classroom; namely, their first language. The teacher capitalizes on this knowledge when introducing new material, always building from the known to the unknown. The students begin their study of the language by studying its sound system. The sounds are associated to different colors using a sound-color chart that is specific to the language being learned. The teacher first elicits sounds that are already present in the students' native language, and then progresses to the development of sounds that are new to them. These sound-color associations are later used to help the students with spelling, reading, and pronunciation. A word chart. Its color-coding enables the teacher to remain silent while students work out pronunciation by themselves. The Silent Way uses a structural syllabus. The teacher will typically introduce one new language structure at a time, and old structures are continuously reviewed and recycled. These structures are chosen for their propositional meaning, not for their communicative value. The teacher will set up learning situations for the students which focus their attention on each new structure. For example, the teacher might ask students to label a floor plan of a house in order to introduce the concepts of inside and outside. Once the language structures have been presented in this way, learners learn the grammar rules through a process of induction. Gattegno saw the choice of which vocabulary to teach as vital to the language learning process. He advised teachers to concentrate on the most functional and versatile words, to help students build a functional vocabulary. Translation and rote repetition are avoided, and instead emphasis is placed on conveying meaning through students' perceptions, and through practicing the language in meaningful contexts. In the floor plan example, the plan itself negates the need for translation, and the teacher is able to give the students meaningful practice simply by pointing to different parts of the house. The four skills of active listening, speaking, reading, and writing are worked on from the beginning stages, although students only learn to read something after they have learned to say it. Evaluation in the Silent Way is carried out primarily by observation. Teachers may never give a formal test, but they constantly assess students by observing their actions. This allows them to respond straight away to any problems the students might have. Teachers also gain feedback through observing students' errors; errors are seen as natural and necessary for learning, and can be a useful guide as to what structures need more practice. Furthermore, teachers may gain feedback by asking the students at the end of the lesson. When evaluating the students, teachers expect them to learn at different rates, and students are not penalized for learning more slowly than their classmates. Teachers look for steady progress in the language, not perfection.  Process = Teaching techniques  As the name implies, silence is a key tool of the teacher in the Silent Way. From the beginning levels, students do 90 percent or more of the talking. Being silent moves the focus of the classroom from the teacher to the students, and can encourage cooperation among them. It also frees the teacher to observe the class. Silence can be used to help students correct their own errors. Teachers can remain silent when a student makes a mistake to give them time to self- correct; they can also help students with their pronunciation by mouthing words without vocalizing, and by using certain hand gestures. When teachers do speak, they tend to say things only once so that students learn to focus their attention on them. A Silent Way classroom also makes extensive use of peer correction. Students are encouraged to help their classmates when they have trouble with any particular feature of the language. This help should be made in a cooperative fashion, not a competitive one. One of the teacher's tasks is to monitor these interactions, so that they are helpful and do not interfere with students' learning.  Teaching materials  A set of Cuisenaire rods The silent way makes use of specialized teaching materials: colored Cuisenaire rods, the sound-color chart, word charts, and Fidel charts. The Cuisenaire rods are wooden, and come in ten different lengths, but identical cross- section; each length has its own assigned color. The rods are used in a wide variety of situations in the classroom. At the beginning stages they can be used to practice colors and numbers, and later they can be used in more complex grammar. For example, to teach prepositions the teacher could use the statement \\"The blue rod is between the green one and the yellow one\\". They can also be used more abstractly, perhaps to represent a clock when students are learning about time. A Fidel chart for English. These charts are used to teach spelling. The sound-color chart consists of blocks of color, with one color representing one sound in the language being learned. The teacher uses this chart to help teach pronunciation; as well as pointing to colors to help students with the different sounds, the teacher can also tap particular colors very hard to help students learn word stress. Later in the learning process, students can point to the chart themselves. The chart can help students perceive sounds that may not occur in their first language, and it also allows students to practice making these sounds without relying on mechanical repetition. It also provides an easily verifiable record of which sounds the students have and which they have not, which can help their autonomy. The word charts contain the functional vocabulary of the target language, and use the same color scheme as the sound-color chart. Each letter is colored in a way that indicates its pronunciation. The teacher can point to the chart to highlight the pronunciation of different words in sentences that the students are learning. There are twelve word charts in English, containing a total of around five hundred words. The Fidel charts also use the same color-coding, and list the various ways that sounds can be spelled. For example, in English, the entry for the sound /ey/ contains the spellings ay, ea, ei, eigh, etc., all written in the same color. These can be used to help students associate sounds with their spelling.  Reception and influence  As of 2000, the Silent Way was only used by a small number of teachers. These teachers often work in situations where accuracy or speed of learning is important. Their working conditions may also be challenging, for example working with illiterate refugees.

Estado de M√©xico is the state with more towns in this category and have implemented diverse programs to stimulate tourism. CONAGO During his position as president of the CONAGO (Conferencia Nacional de Gobernadores), Eruviel √Åvila treated different subjects related to transparency, formality on jobs, an only police power, between others. Speaking of transparency, some agreements were promoted with the Public Funsion Secretary, SFP (Secretaria de la Funci√≥n Publica) and the Nacional System of Transparency (SNT) to consolidate responsible and transparent governments, thanks to the right of free access to information and the fight to corruption inside the public politics. By October 2015, the federal government and the CONAGO made an agreement called CIEN (Certificaci√≥n de Infraestructura en Educaci√≥n) with the purpose of attend and improve the infrastructure of the school buildings. In the labor trade, the CONAGO pushed some politics for the inclusion of people with disabilities to the labor market. By November 2015, in association with the CONASETRA (Conferencia Nacional de Secretarios del Trabajo) a trade of labor politics was made, where the priority to include the young people in the labor market was exposed, increasing the job opportunities and the diffusion of those, reducing the difficulties to find a first job and creating innovating micro business programs.

Feeling close to the protagonist may enhance the depth of fear and helplessness a viewer might experience. Empathy has long been a subject of communications research. Zillmann and Cantor (1977)2 indicated that regardless of the source of empathy, its existence predicts that viewers may vicariously experience the emotions displayed by the protagonist. Their research in empathetic reactions indicated that, at least in children, the actions and emotions of the protagonist had a direct effect on the viewers‚Äô enjoyment of the film. Empathy has been defined in different ways in an attempt by researchers to clarify diverse aspects of the phenomenon. Dolf Zillmann (1991), while at the University of Alabama, cited such a diversity of meanings of empathy by fellow researchers that, on the surface, may appear to conflict with one another. He nevertheless brushes this apparent conflict aside with the assertion that the common core of these various explanations is that they relate to a subjects‚Äô emotional responses to and affinity with other peoples‚Äô emotions and their reactions to those emotions (p. 136).3 Tamborini et al. (1990) examined empathy as a ‚Äúset of constructs,‚Äù4 among which are wandering imagination, fictional involvement, humanistic orientation and emotional contagion. The first two constructs point to imagination as a necessary criterion for empathy to occur. Those with a higher degree of imaginative tendency could be especially subject to a heightened empathetic experience. The third construct, humanistic orientation, refers to concern for the character. Under this construct, one may become deeply involved in the well- being of the character. By extension, one may become highly empathetic to the plight of the character. The fourth construct, emotional contagion, refers to the emotions of fellow viewers and the role they may play in influencing one‚Äôs own emotions. Thus the displayed emotions of those around one may affect one‚Äôs own level, or type, of emotional display. Tamborini et al. (1990) considered it reasonable to expect that imagination would be an important factor in empathy, given these constructs. One must be able to place oneself in the shoes of another, so to speak, to become deeply involved in the plight of the character. The implication could be that individuals with a stronger penchant for daydreaming might more readily form an empathic bond with a character, therefore experiencing a stronger emotional connection (p. 620).5 Sparks et al. (1993) indicated that it is not uncommon for reactions to frightening television programming to remain with one indefinitely. These reactions included ‚Äúnervousness, sleep disturbances, and fear of going into certain rooms in the home‚Äù (p. 466).6 This is attributed to arousal, which was also indicated by Zillmann (1991) as a potential factor in empathy. Sparks et al. (1993) further suggested that subjects experiencing high arousal might be more susceptible to fright reactions than those who experience low arousal (p. 467).7  References  1\\\\.

The goal was to produce an accurate, low- recoil .30-caliber hunting cartridge that could be used in an AR-15-type rifle using as many standard components as possible. Design The 7.62√ó40mm WT (Wilson Tactical) is based on the 7.62√ó40mm wildcat cartridge, the shoulder of the WT was moved .003\\" forward and the throat was made .001\\" larger to accommodate mass-production tolerances while staying within the tolerance of the original reloading die tooling of the 7.62√ó40mm. The parent case (5.56√ó45mm NATO) was trimmed down to 1.560\\" and re-sized with a 7.62√ó40mm WT sizing die. The overall case length after the shortening and re-sizing is 1.565\\". The cartridge was designed to use .308\\" diameter bullets in weights of 110 to 150 grains, with a standard twist rate of 1-12\\". Wilson Combat states that heavier bullets can be used in a barrel with a 1-8\\" twist rate for subsonic loads. Cartridge use Wilson had been hunting feral hogs with both the .30 Remington AR and .300 AAC Blackout. However, since most feral hog hunting is performed at night, he did not like looking for proprietary brass cases after he had fired them and designed the 7.62 X 40mm around the inexpensive and readily available 5.56 NATO cartridge. (The 7.62x40mm WT is a cartridge designed by Kurt Buchert and brought to market by Wilson Combat. ) The 7.62√ó40mm WT is designed for both tactical and defense rifles and for hunting medium-sized game. In tactical applications, the 110 gr Barnes TTSX bullet can be used to penetrate tough barriers, while the soft-point and hollow-point bullets provide reliable terminal performance on soft tissue. In hunting applications, the 7.62√ó40mm WT delivers slightly more energy than the 7.62√ó39mm and is similar to the 6.8 SPC and .30-30 Winchester, making it useful for game such as deer and feral hogs, particularly for hunters who want to use an AR-15, but cannot legally use the 5.56 round, due to its low power factor on game. Firearms writer Wayne Van Zwoll describes the round as being very accurate. Firearms chambered for 7.62√ó40mm WT Since the 7.62√ó40mm WT is based upon the 5.56mm NATO, the only required modification to AR-15/M4 rifles currently chambered for 5.56mm NATO or .223 Remington is a new barrel. Wilson Combat offers barrels and complete upper receiver sets, with barrel lengths offered in 11.3\\", 16\\", 18\\", and 20\\". US Machine Gun Armory in Utah has begun offering a conversion kit for the Mk 46/M249 in 7.62 WT. Because of Wilson's modification to the parent case, some capacity is lost in a standard AR-15 magazine. Wilson partnered with Lancer to produce a true 20-round magazine for the 7.62 X40 by removing the feed guide rib inside the magazine and sells the magazine as a \\"Lancer 1.5\\". Cartridge availability Wilson Combat currently (2011) offers custom loaded 7.62√ó40mm WT ammunition with bullet weights of 110gr and 125gr, but the cartridge can also be hand-loaded using new brass available from Wilson Combat, or by using 5.56mm NATO or .223 Remington brass and the appropriate sizing/forming dies available from Wilson Combat.

In comparison to most anti-virus or anti-spyware software, the primary difference is that an anti-keylogger does not make a distinction between a legitimate keystroke- logging program and an illegitimate keystroke-logging program (such as malware); all keystroke-logging programs are flagged and optionally removed, whether they appear to be legitimate keystroke-logging software or not. Use of anti-keyloggers Keyloggers are sometimes part of malware packages downloaded onto computers without the owners' knowledge. Detecting the presence of a keylogger on a computer can be difficult. So-called anti- keylogging programs have been developed to thwart keylogging systems, and these are often effective when used properly. Anti-keyloggers are used both by large organizations as well as individuals in order to scan for and remove (or in some cases simply immobilize) keystroke logging software on a computer. It is generally advised the software developers that anti-keylogging scans be run on a regular basis in order to reduce the amount of time during which a keylogger may record keystrokes. For example, if a system is scanned once every three days, there is a maximum of only three days during which a keylogger could be hidden on the system and recording keystrokes. Public computers Public computers are extremely susceptible to the installation of keystroke logging software and hardware, and there are documented instances of this occurring. Public computers are particularly susceptible to keyloggers because any number of people can gain access to the machine and install both a hardware keylogger and a software keylogger, either or both of which can be secretly installed in a matter of minutes. Anti-keyloggers are often used on a daily basis to ensure that public computers are not infected with keyloggers, and are safe for public use. Gaming usage Keyloggers have been prevalent in the online gaming industry, being used to secretly record a gamer's access credentials, user name and password, when logging into an account, this information is sent back to the hacker. The hacker can sign on later to the account and change the password to the account, thus stealing it. World of Warcraft has been of particular importance to game hackers and has been the target of numerous keylogging viruses. Anti-keyloggers are used by many World of Warcraft and other gaming community members in order to try to keep their gaming accounts secure. Financial institutions Financial institutions have become the target of keyloggers, particularly those institutions which do not use advanced security features such as PIN pads or screen keyboards. Anti- keyloggers are used to run regular scans of any computer on which banking or client information is accessed, protecting passwords, banking information, and credit card numbers from identity thieves. Personal use The most common use of an anti-keylogger is by individuals wishing to protect their privacy while using their computer; uses range from protecting financial information used in online banking, any passwords, personal communication, and virtually any other information which may be typed into a computer. Keyloggers are often installed by people known by the computer's owner, and many times have been installed by an ex-partner hoping to spy on their ex-partner's activities, particularly chat.  Types =Signature-based This type of software has a signature base, that is strategic information that helps to uniquely identify a keylogger, and the list contains as many known keyloggers as possible. Some vendors make some effort or availability of an up-to-date listing for download by customers. Each time a 'System Scan' is run, this software compares the contents of the hard disk drive, item by item, against the list, looking for any matches. This type of software is a rather widespread one, but it has its own drawbacks The biggest drawback of signature-based anti-keyloggers is that one can only be protected from keyloggers found on the signature-base list, thus staying vulnerable to unknown or unrecognized keyloggers. A criminal can download one of many famous keyloggers, change it just enough, and the anti-keylogger won't recognize it. Heuristic analysis This software doesn't use signature bases, it uses a checklist of known features, attributes, and methods that keyloggers are known use. It analyzes the methods of work of all the modules in a PC, thus blocking the activity of any module that is similar to the work of keyloggers. Though this method gives better keylogging protection than signature-based anti- keyloggers, it has its own drawbacks. One of them is that this type of software blocks non-keyloggers also. Several 'non-harmful' software modules, either part of the operating system or part of legitimate apps, use processes which keyloggers also use, which can trigger a false positive. Usually all the non signature-based keyloggers have the option to allow the user to unblock selected modules, but this can cause difficulties for inexperienced users who are unable to discern good modules from bad modules when manually choosing to block or unblock.

The Church, based in Sweden, has been officially recognized by the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency as a religious community in January 2012, after three application attempts. Gerson has denied any connection between the Church and filesharing site The Pirate Bay, but both groups are associated with the Swedish art and hacking collective Piratbyr√•n.  Name  The name Kopimism derives from the words copy and me which are the fundamental roots of the Church's beliefs and calls for an invitation to copy information. The work \\"Kopimi\\" first showed up on a pirate Agency Forum. Isak Gerson, one of the core founders saw something beautiful and theological in this concept of \\"copy me\\"Gerson I (2014a) Interview with Gerson. By Nilsson PE, Upssala, 7 May and argued that the digital sharing of data is a fundamental act in our universe through the reproduction and copying of cells, DNA, and genes and that the entirety of the internet is essentially for sharing. Gerson has been credited with once saying, \\"The only thing we can do as Christians now, I suppose, is to do what Jesus tried doing ‚Äì and do it better.\\" Tenets The followers of the religion are called Kopimists from copy me. A \\"Kopimist\\" or \\"Kopimist intellectual\\" is a person who has the philosophical belief that all information should be freely distributed and unrestricted. This philosophy opposes the monopolization of knowledge in all its forms, such as copyright, and encourages file sharing of all types of media including music, movies, TV shows, and software. In fact, the act of withholding and economizing information through copyright is against the sacredness of information. In its spiritual emphasis on copying as an ideal, Kopimism shares values with Chinese aesthetic traditions, in which \\"copying is valued not only as a learning tool (as it is in the West) but as artistically satisfying in its own right,\\" a concept also called duplitecture. According to the church, \\"In our belief, communication is sacred.\\" No belief in gods or supernatural phenomena apart from Kopimi itself is mentioned on their web site. CTRL+C and CTRL+V, the common computer shortcut keys for \\"Copy\\" and \\"Paste,\\" are considered sacred symbols. Some groups believe that Kopimi is considered to be a god, and others believing it to be a sacred symbol and spirit residing within every living being. The community also holds a religious service known as \\"kopyacting\\" in which information is distributed to the believers using photocopiers. According to the Kopimist constitution: * Copying of information is ethically right; * Dissemination of information is ethically right; * Copymixing is a sacred kind of copying, more so than the perfect, digital copying, because it expands and enhances the existing wealth of information; * Copying or remixing information communicated by another person is seen as an act of respect and a strong expression of acceptance and Kopimistic faith; * The Internet is holy (Not generally accepted by churches run by the Maesters); * Code is law. On January 5, 2012, Kopimism was accepted by Sweden as a legitimate religion with an estimated 4,000 members. The religion's association with illegal file sharing has been said not to be a sign that illegal file-sharing will be excused from Sweden's zero-tolerance approach to the controversial matter.  International locations  Kopimism has also taken root in multiple nations, including: * Canada * Japan * Israel * United States of America (including in the state of Illinois in the United States where Kopimism has registered as a non profit 503(c) organization in the form of a church.) First wedding On April 28, 2012, the Missionary Church of Kopimism held their first wedding. The wedding took place in Belgrade, Serbia, between a Romanian woman and an Italian man. The holy ceremony was conducted by a Kopimistic Op, wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, while a computer read vows and some of Kopimism's central beliefs aloud.https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/05/07/til-delete-do-us-part- first-couple-married-under-swedish-file-sharing-religion The church declared: \\"We are very happy today. Love is all about sharing. A married couple shares everything with each other. Hopefully, they will copy and remix some DNA-cells and create a new human being. That is the spirit of Kopimism. Feel the love and share that information. Copy all of its holiness.\\" Gerson, the missionary leader of the Church of Kopimism, attended as a witness during the wedding.  Controversies  Both founders, Gerson and Nipe have had an extensive background in online activism and served as major players in the Swedish Piracy MovementDahlstrom F (2011) Han vill att fildelning ska klassas som religion. Uppsalatidningen, 8 April. which caused many journalists and government officials in Sweden to speculate on the real goals of the creation of this organization. There was severe backlash amongst the media and Christian journals in 2011 after the founders first submitted their application for registering as a religion as journalists condemned the Missionary Church of Kopimism as \\"a political adventure\\", \\"a PR stunt\\", and \\"a devaluation of religion\\".

It is located in Lakhpat taluka of Kutch district, Gujarat, India. The ancient Koteshwar temple lies only 4 km away. Temples The temples, the chief buildings in the place, are surrounded by a fortified wall, outside of which cluster the villagers' houses. It was formerly connected with the mainland by a yellow stone causeway, about 3000 feet long and fifteen wide, built in 1863 by a Bhatia of Bombay, named Gokaldas Liladhar Padsha, at a cost of about ¬£2500 (1,00,000 Kutch koris). Now the new causeway is built. It was in very ancient times famous for its great lake. This, agreeing with the account of the lake found by Alexander, and perhaps lasting till the change of the course of the Indus river (about 1000), was in part renewed by the earthquake of 1819. Beside the lake, there was, from early times, a temple of Adinarayan in the village. For long under priests of the Kanphata sect, the temple was, about 1550 (Samvat 1607), wrested from them by a Sanyasi or Atit named Narangar from Junagadh. Narangar made long and broad embankments about the pool, an oblong sheet of water, 1056 feet by 990, divided by perforated stone walls into a number of bathing places, and furnished on all sides except the east with flights of stone steps, and surrounded by rest-houses. There are seven stone temples in a paved courtyard of 164 feet by 62. The temples are approached from the lake by flights of stone steps and surrounded by a strong wall. Vagheli Mahakunvar; the wife of Rao Deshalji I, Rao of Cutch State; displeased with the priests of Dwarka, after taking counsel with her Brahmans, determined to raise Narayansar to be a place of rival sanctity. Accordingly, in 1734, she first built the temples of Lakshminarayan and Trikamray in the same style as the Dwarka temples, assigning them the revenues of certain villages and the proceeds of certain taxes, and then those of Adinarayan, Govardhannath, Dwarkanath, and Lakshmiji. The temple of Trikamray, in style and shape resembling that at Koteshwar, 72 feet long 68 broad and 61 high, stands on a 5 feet 9 inches high platform, and has three side porches with a large one in the centre, all capped with domes resting on twelve feet high pillars. The central porch is 21 feet square, and each of the side porches 9 feet 9 inches. The 1819 earthquake threw down the central dome, but it has since been rebuilt. The space between the central dome and the shrine is paved with white and black marble. In the east screen wall of the shrine is a marble plate with an inscription. The doors are plated with silver. In the shrine, on a silver throne, stands a black marble image of Trikamray. Under the idol throne is a black marble figure of Vishnu's eagle, Garuda, with clasped hands kneeling on one leg. Over the image of Trikamray are forty gold and silver parasols, the offerings of devotees. The other five temples built by Vagheli Mahakunvar form, along with the more lately built temple of Kalyanray, a row of six domes supported by fourteen pillars, and forty-eight pilasters, with carving on the bases, shafts, and capitals. The brackets are scrolled volutes and the side pillars of one dome serve to support the lintel of the next, and the corresponding pillars of the next act similarly for the third dome. The temples at the two ends have screen walls under their domes with doors, but the rest have a common verandah with entrances in the fronts the space on the two sides of each entrance being closed with a screen of wooden lattice. Each of the temples has an inscription. Lakshmiji's temple is without any special feature. Dwarkanath's or Ranchhodji's temple has a small shrine opposite to it with a large image of Garuda, holding a weapon whose point impales a cobra. The third shrine, to Govardhannath, is simple. The fourth, to Adinarayan, has a black stone pavement in the gallery. Opposite it is a small lately built shrine of Gopalji. The last, to Lakshminarayan, has silver-plated doors and an idol throne and canopy of silver. In a line with these five temples is the temple of Kalyanray built in 1828 (Samvat 1885) by Rao Deshalji II. The stone and wood frames of the entrance are richly carved, and the doors are plated with silver in which flowers, fruit, leaves, and creepers are carved with much skill. The canopy of the god stands on a pedestal, and is supported on four silver pillars with fine spiral flutes and richly carved friezes, bases, and shafts. The statue is of polished black marble.Shree Kutch Gurjar Kshatriya Samaj : A brief History & Glory of our fore-fathers : Page :27 by Raja Pawan Jethwa. (2007) Calcutta. Besides these built temples, the soft sandstone near the fort has at various times been hollowed into shrines and caves. They are known as the Ramgupha, Lakshmangupha, and Sheshgupha caves. From the brittleness of the rock they are of no great size. Religious significance According to Hindu theology, there are five sacred lakes; collectively called Panch-Sarovar; Mansarovar, Bindu Sarovar, Narayan Sarovar, Pampa Sarovar and Pushkar Sarovar. Encyclopaedia of tourism resources in India, Volume 2 By Manohar Sajnani As per legends, one of the holy rivers of India, Sarasvati River had an out let in to sea near present-day Narayan Sarovar and waters of lake were filled with holy waters of River Saraswati, that is why this place was and is still considered as one of the five holy lakes by Hindus.One outlet of the Saraswati into the sea was at Lokpat which was also a major seat of learning and a port. Further downstream was Narayan Sarovar which is mentioned in the Mahabharta as a holy place. Vallabhacharya visited the place during his lifetime as such the site is sacred also for the follower of Pushtimarg. Fairs Two yearly fairs are held here, one in Chaitra (April -May) and the other from the 10th to the 15th of Kartik (November- December), when, from western India, thousands of pilgrims come to perform funeral ceremonies on the bank of the Narayan Sarovar. Accommodation facilities are available for pilgrims. In 1981, the area around the village is notified as a wildlife sanctuary, Narayan Sarovar Sanctuary. The red antelopes or chinkaras are found in the sanctuary.

The Mojo Triangle has presented the world with an astonishing array of creative artists, not just in music, but also in literature and films. Origins of the Mojo Triangle Blues, rock 'n' roll, jazz and country‚Äîall potent brews of the swamp. This alligator-bearing cypress swamp bumps against the Natchez Trace just outside Jackson, Mississippi, in the heart of Mojoland. The phrase \\"Mojo Triangle\\" was first coined by author James L. Dickerson in his award-winning 2005 book, Mojo Triangle: Birthplace of Country, Blues, Jazz and Rock 'n' Roll.Dickerson, James L. (2005) \\"Mojo Triangle,\\" Schirmer Trade Books A fiddle tune named \\"Natchez Under the Hill,\\" which originated in the joints along the docks in Natchez, was one of the first original songs ever published in America, according to Dickerson. Published in 1834, it was re-titled \\"Old Zip Coon,\\" only to later morph into \\"Turkey in the Straw.\\" With that song began a tradition that inspired the creation of a musical dynasty.Dickerson, James L. (2005) \\"Mojo Triangle.\\" Natchez remained a musical cauldron throughout the 1800s, blending traditional folk music from Europe with the exotic rhythms and harmonies of the Choctaw and Chickasaw, and the unique phrasing vocalized by slaves from Africa. But it was not until the late 1920s, when Jimmie Rodgers began recording what would later be recognized as America's first country music that the first blend of European/Native American/African music took hold. Ten years later, Robert Johnson took the music recorded by Rodgers and moved it a step further by recording what we today call blues music. Both Rodgers and Johnson owe an enormous debt to the Choctaw. \\"Both use 6/4, 5/4, and 4/4 time signatures, and both use short 6/4 introductions that quickly change to 5/4 or 4/4 after one or two bars. For example Johnson's 'Little Queen of Spades' has a one bar introduction in 6/4 that changes to 4/4, an identical time signature to the Choctaw's 'Wedding Dance,' which also goes 6/4 to 4/4.\\"Dickerson, James L. (2005) \\"Mojo Triangle: Birthplace of Country, Blues, Jazz and Rock 'n' Roll,\\" p. 90 Musicians in New Orleans incorporated the music of Natchez and added Caribbean influences to produce jazz, a free- flowing instrumental interpretation of the same influences that birthed blues and country. In the mid-1950s, Elvis Presley, Scotty Moore and Bill Black took the work of Rodgers and Johnson and gave shape to rock 'n' roll, creating an unbroken circle of creativity that continues to this day.

He has worked as a magazine editor and publisher, newspaper editor, reporter, columnist, book critic, and social worker. His book, Mojo Triangle, was the winner of a 2006 IPPY award (Independent Publisher Book Awards) in the non-fiction category. Two other books, Goin' Back to Memphis and That's Alright, Elvis, were finalists for the Gleason Award, given out annually by Rolling Stone magazine, BMI, and New York University. In the mid-to-late 1980s, Dickerson was the publisher/editor of Nine-O-One Network Magazine, the first magazine located in the Mojo Triangle to obtain newsstand circulation in all 50 states. He co-owned and produced a radio syndication, Pulsebeat‚ÄîVoice of the Heartland, which focused on the music produced in the Mojo Triangle. Dickerson, James L. \\"Goin' Back to Memphis: A Century of Blues, Rock 'n' Roll, and Glorious Soul\\" (Schirmer/Simon & Schuster/1996) Other music historians who have written about musicians from the Mojo Triangle are Stanley Booth (The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones, Rhythm Oil, and Furry's Blues); Peter Guralnick (Sweet Soul Music) and Robert Palmer (Deep Blues). None of those writers were born in the Triangle, but all wrote extensively on the blues. Palmer, who died in 1997, was a music writer for the New York Times and spent the last years of his life living in the Mojo Triangle. Booth, who lives in Georgia, has contributed to Rolling Stone, Playboy, and Esquire. Guralnick is probably best known for his two- volume biography of Elvis Presley.

Background Zanna was a successful businessman, and a member of the board of many federal establishments. For example, in 2000 he was in the board of the National Electrical Power Authority (NEPA). In 2007, Zanna was one of the organizers of the Democratic Women Forum, an organization that supported the political aspirations of former military ruler General Ibrahim Babangida. He was also a member of the Power Sector Reform Committee. He is described as an elder with a good track record in public service. Senate election In the PDP primaries, Zanna defeated the former secretary to the state government, Dr Bukar Abba. Zanna was thought to be politically naive compared to his opponent in the Senate race, the state Governor Ali Modu Sheriff. However, Zanna easily defeated Sheriff, who was running on the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) platform. Zanna won 189,232 against Sheriff's 120,377 votes, while Alhaji El-Nur Dongel of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) came third with 20,414 votes. Sheriff's defeat may have been due to dissatisfaction with his record during his eight-year tenure as governor. This period saw several religious riots in which many churches were destroyed, massive killings and destruction of property by the Boko Haram fundamentalist Islamist sect, and little or no compensation to the 40% of the state population who are Christian. After the election, the ANPP and CPC called on Attahiru Jega, Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to nullify the election. They claimed that results were marred by vote rigging, killing, intimidation, stuffing of ballot boxes and victimization of voters. Following his election, Zanna promised to support implementation of the Lake Chad replenishment project, which would bring water from a river in West Congo to Lake Chad. The lake has been drying up, affecting the livelihood of 25 million farmers and fishermen in Nigeria and neighboring countries. He died on 16 May 2015, aged 60.

Fiat Trattori was a constructor of agricultural equipment, and tractors in particular. Over its decades of history it established itself as Italy's leading constructor and one of the biggest in Europe; in 1991 it took over Ford New Holland and adopted its name to increase its status on the world markets. In 1999 New Holland acquired Case Corporation to create CNH Global, in which Fiat Industrial was the majority shareholder until the two firms merged to create CNH Industrial in 2013.

Origins  The history of Fiat Trattori began in 1918 when it launched its first tractor, the Fiat 702, which had 30 horsepower.New Holland Official Site http://agriculture.newholland.com/italy/it/WNH/whoweare/Pages/alonghistory.aspx The model 702 was followed by the 702A, B and BN variants and then the 703B and 703BN.DOZZA W., MISLEY M.: Fiat Trattori dal 1919 ad oggi, 2008 Giorgio Nada Editore, p. 16 and 17 With these variants, in production until 1925, Fiat Trattori reached the milestone of the 2,000 units produced. In 1929 the plant was selling tractors at the rate of more than 1,000 units a year. 1932 saw the launch of the first European crawler tractor, the Fiat 700C. In the same year, tractor production was transferred from Turin to Modena, where OCI (Officine Costruzioni Industriali) was founded.DOZZA W., MISLEY M.: Fiat Trattori dal 1919 ad oggi, 2008 Giorgio Nada Editore, p. 26 The first tractor produced at the new plant was the 702C with 28 Hp instead of 35, much lighter than the previous version.DOZZA W., MISLEY M.: Fiat Trattori dal 1919 ad oggi, 2008 Giorgio Nada Editore, p. 27 This tractor was to remain in production until 1950, with 4,000 units produced.DOZZA W., MISLEY M.: Fiat Trattori dal 1919 ad oggi, 2008 Giorgio Nada Editore, p. 30 At the Modena plant, Fiat produced the Fiat 700C crawler tractor, offering impressive traction capacity thanks to the tracks which prevented it from sinking into wet ground.DOZZA W., MISLEY M.: Fiat Trattori dal 1919 ad oggi, 2008 Giorgio Nada Editore, p. 31 In 1933 Fiat took over OM (standing for Societ√† Anonima Officine Meccaniche) which produced both industrial vehicles and tractors. In 1939, the Modena plant launched the first mass-produced tractor, the Fiat 40 Boghetto; thanks to an invention by Fortunato Boghetto, this tractor's engine was able to operate on a variety of fuels (kerosene, diesel, alcohol, petrol, natural gas and gasifier gas).DOZZA W., MISLEY M.: Fiat Trattori dal 1919 ad oggi, 2008 Giorgio Nada Editore, p. 34 In 1944, production at the Modena plant was halted by the lack of raw materials and the German occupation, leading to its conversion for the repair and overhaul of military vehicles. Against this backdrop, the Chief Design Engineer Edmondo Tascheri began work on the design of a new crawler tractor, to be more modern than the now obsolete Series 40 Boghetto, with the aid of a few photographs of a Russian tractor brought back from the Soviet Front by some workmen. Assisted by the connivance of collaborators, the Technical Department started to build a secret prototype unbeknown to the German controllers. The resulting Fiat 50 crawler tractor was produced after the Second World War, starting in 1946, thanks in part to the recovery of the machine tools the German occupiers had attempted to ship to Germany before their plans were thwarted by the allied bombing raids.DOZZA W., MISLEY M.: Fiat Trattori dal 1919 ad oggi, 2008 Giorgio Nada Editore, p. 42-44 The Postwar Years In the postwar years (1949), the OCI plant in Modena began production of the Fiat 600 and the crawler Fiat 601,DOZZA W., MISLEY M.: Fiat Trattori dal 1919 ad oggi, 2008 Giorgio Nada Editore, p. 48-50 featuring the use of levers instead of a steering wheel.CARROLL J.: The World Encyclopedia of Tractors & Farm Machinery, 1999 Lorenz Book, p. 142 With these tractors sales soared, generating output of 1,832 vehicles a year. In the early ‚Äò50s, Fiat established an alliance with the French company SIMCA, which began to manufacture Fiat cars and then tractors to Fiat designs. 1951 saw the launch of the Fiat 25R, one of the key machines in Fiat's history. The innovative tractor, coloured orange (the first in a long series of tractors, down to 1983) launched Fiat onto the European agricultural market. Produced in a large number of models, operating on Diesel and Diesel, wheel or crawler, narrow and industrial, in orchard and forestry versions, almost 45,000 units of this remarkable machine were launched onto the market.DOZZA W., MISLEY M.: Fiat Trattori dal 1919 ad oggi, 2008 Giorgio Nada Editore, p. 54-58 The next year saw the launch of the high-power OM tractors. The best-seller was the OM 35-40 model, also produced in crawler version. The Fiat 60 crawler tractor, replacing the old Fiat 50 models, was launched in 1956. With this tractor, Fiat established itself as the world‚Äôs leading constructor of crawler tractors. In 1957 Fiat launched the biggest selling tractor of the 1950s, the ‚Äúlittle‚Äù FIAT 18.DOZZA W., MISLEY M.: Fiat Trattori dal 1919 ad oggi, 2008 Giorgio Nada Editore, p. 68 1959 saw the appearance of the successor to the Series 18, the Series 200, produced until 1965. The 211 R model was equipped with a 1135 cc two-cylinder Fiat 615 Diesel engine, developing at 2200 rpm. The ‚Äú211 Rb‚Äù model had a 1221 cc 4-cylinder Fiat 103 petrol engine and generated at 2300 rpm.

They were followed by the 1000 and 1300 (Fiat); with these models, Fiat targeted the European market, and almost ten years later it was to become leader in Europe with the SERIES 80. In the early 1970s the range underwent a change and the 250 model became the 300 model, the special 350 was launched and the 480 and 500 models replaced the 450 model, before evolving into the 540 Special. Also in the 1970s, when the 80 series had already appeared, the 850 became the FIAT 850 super, with an increase in power to ; the 1000 received the same treatment (super), with a boost to ; the super 1300 increased to . From the 1970s to the 1990s In 1975 Fiat Trattori acquired 20% of Laverda SpA founded by Pietro Laverda in 1873, a company that has specialised in combines since its birth. The mid-1970s also saw the launch of the Fiat 80 series with the (3, 4, 5 and 6 cylinder) models Fiat 580, Fiat 680, Fiat 780, Fiat 880, Fiat 880\\\\5 (5 cyl.), Fiat 980, Fiat 1180, Fiat 1280, Fiat 1380, Fiat 1580 and the top-of-the-range Fiat 1880. These tractors were the first in the world to have a platform mounted on silent blocks and a cab styled as one with the tractor, designed by Pininfarina. In 1976, Fiat Trattori's output exceeded 86,000 tractors DOZZA W., MISLEY M.: Fiat Trattori dal 1919 ad oggi, 2008 Giorgio Nada Editore, p. 104 and no fewer than 50,000 units were exported, compared to the 15,488 in 1955. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, it imported into Italy a number of low-cost models produced in Argentina under the Fiat Concord logo: the 500, 650, 600E/E DT/F, 700E, 800, 900E, 1100E and 1100E Dt. With the expansion of mechanisation, some agricultural machines also began to be used in the construction industry. The 70C, 80C, 90C and 100C models, used for ploughing, received just a few structural changes to become the AD3, AD4, AD5, AD6, AD7, AD9, AD1O, AD12, AD14, AD18 and AD20 crawler loaders. In 1974, Fiat joined forces with the American Allis-Chalmers company to create Fiat-Allis to manufacture a line of crawler machines produced in Brazil, United States and Italy, wheel backhoe- loaders (United States and United Kingdom), excavators (Italy and Brazil), graders and dozers (United States). In the mid-1990s, Fiat formed an alliance with Hitachi to produce construction equipment under the Fiat-Hitachi name. Fiat-Allis continued to sell under its brand in Latin America. Fiat 44-28, 280 hp From 1979 to 1983 Fiat began the production of high-power tractors, under an agreement with the American company Versatile.

He teamed up with his brother-in-law Friedrich Weyerh√§user and formed Weyerh√§user-Denkmann Lumber Company. Biography=Early life Frederick Carl August Denkmann was born in Salzwedel in the Kingdom of Prussia, present-day Saxony-Anhalt, Germany and immigrated to the United States. He was a skilled machinist and worked for Buford and Tate Foundry in Rock Island. He also owned a small grocery store that was operated by his wife Catherine. In 1860 the Mead, Smith and Marsh sawmill in Rock Island went bankrupt. Friedrich Weyerh√§user who was married to Catherine Denkmann's sister Sarah, had worked at the mill. The mill was seized by the sheriff and put up for sale. Weyerh√§user convinced Denkmann to go in with him and buy it for $3,000, with a $500 down payment. Weyerhaeuser-Denkmann The Weyerhaeuser-Denkmann Lumber Company immediately became successful after Denkmann improved its production methods. Production doubled from its previous year‚Äôs capacity of 8,000 board feet per day. Denkmann worked long hours to insure that the machinery was in working order. He nearly drowned in the Mississippi River trying to save logs that escaped from the boom, which is a holding pen for the logs on the river. On another occasion he lost two fingers in a planer. Denkmann was reported to have had his hand tied up, placed in a sling and was at work in the mill the next day. While Denkmann focused his attention on the mill, Weyerh√§user‚Äîwho was a natural salesman‚Äîtook care of the commercial aspects of the business. Denkmann and Weyerh√§user were able to expand the mill and added more machinery. They also bought a second lumber mill that was renamed Anawalt, Denkmann and Company. They signed a lucrative contract with Union Pacific Railroad for 950,000 board feet of lumber. They went to the white pine forests along the Chippewa River in Wisconsin for a new source for wood. They were among 17 lumber companies that formed the Mississippi River Logging Company in 1872. They would harvest the timber in the north and send it to the mills along the river in log rafts. In one day in 1896 a record 64 rafts passed under the Government Bridge between Rock Island and Davenport, Iowa. The longest recorded raft was sent down the Mississippi that same year. It measured 1,560 feet (475.5 M) by 296 feet (90 m) and covered of water. It was powered by a sternwheeler named the F.C.A. Denkmann. Fire destroyed the Anawalt, Denkmann mill in 1876 and caused an estimated $40,000 in losses. They built a new mill on the same site and acquired the troubled Keator mill on 24th Street and added it to Anawalt, Denkmann in 1878. Denkmann and Weyerh√§user formed a new corporation for the two mills and called it the Rock Island Lumber and Manufacturing Company. Ten years later the two companies, Weyerhaeuser-Denkmann Lumber Company and Rock Island Lumber and Manufacturing, employed 1,000 men and had $175 million in annual sales. In 1885 they bought the Renwick, Shaw and Crosset Company mill across the river in Davenport. On July 24, 1901 the mill, along with the Lindsay and Phelps mill, the Robert‚Äôs wood yard and a section of southeast Davenport was destroyed in a fire. Denkmann raced across the Government Bridge with extra fire hoses to help put out the fire. The fire destroyed , left 250 people homeless and caused $1.25 million in damage. Denkmann and Weyerh√§user had two other companies fail. A flour mill in nearby Coal Valley, Illinois and a woolen mill in Rock Island were both financial failures. Death Frederick Denkmann died in 1905 at the age of 82. The lumber mill in Rock Island ceased operating on November 18, 1905, six months after his death. By this time Friedrich Weyerh√§user had re-located to the Pacific Northwest where he had recently established the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company. While Denkmann was still alive the two gave substantial amounts of money to build the Rock Island Public Library. After he died, Frederick Denkmann‚Äôs children donated what is now known as Denkmann Memorial Hall to Augustana College in Rock Island. The building served as a library from 1911 to 1990. It now houses the college's foreign language departments and other offices. River of Life window Denkmann Mausoleum in Chippiannock Cemetery After Frederick Denkmann died he was buried in a mausoleum in Rock Island‚Äôs Chippiannock Cemetery. On April 5, 1976 the cemetery superintendent Joseph Vogele discovered that the mausoleum had been broken into and a stained glass window by Louis Comfort Tiffany was stolen. The thieves were never caught, but the window was located in Jamaica, New York in the 1990s. It was eventually returned to the Denkmann family in 1997 and a Tiffany glass conservator was hired to repair a couple of cracks in the window in 1999. It is now on permanent loan to the Figge Art Museum in Davenport.

He is voiced by British comedian and writer Stephen Merchant, and created in part by Portal 2s designer Erik Wolpaw. In the Portal narrative, Wheatley is one of several spherical \\"personality cores\\" developed to restrain GLaDOS, the main artificial intelligence that operates the Aperture Science facility, from becoming rampant, though Wheatley is later revealed to have been built to act as an intelligence dampener towards GLaDOS. Initially serving as a comedic foil to the player-character Chell during the first half of Portal 2, Wheatley becomes the main antagonist of the second half as he takes GLaDOS' place and wreaks havoc on the facility before Chell and GLaDOS (who is now being powered by a potato battery) stop him. In addition to Portal 2, Wheatley has appeared in Team Fortress 2 and Lego Dimensions. He also appears in Rocket League as an antenna that can be equipped to the car of the player's choice. Since his appearance in Portal 2, Wheatley has received overwhelmingly positive reception from critics. Merchant has been praised for his portrayal by critics who cited his fast-talking dialogue. Wheatley has also been described as a contrast to GLaDOS' \\"slower-speaking and more deliberate\\" personality. Concept and creation Wheatley was first revealed in an ARG released by Valve, the developer of the Portal series, in a screenshot of Portal 2 before its release, showing the player-character Chell holding him. Wheatley came from combining several ideas from multiple \\"personality cores\\" that the player would meet throughout the game. The idea was removed as it supposedly made the game feel too cluttered and the player never got to really learn about the multiple robots, so several were combined into the character of Wheatley. Wheatley was designed with the purpose of making a character who \\"you‚Äôd be seeing a lot\\". Erik Wolpaw added that Wheatley served as an \\"offset\\" of GLaDOS; while her voice is \\"slower-speaking and more deliberate\\", Wheatley is a \\"frantic person\\", which Erik says is performed well by Merchant due to being able to relay information quickly in his speech. Merchant was chosen for the role both because the designers were fans of British comedy and because of Merchant's role in the television series Extras and his podcasts. Merchant was sent a package of Portal 2 material along with a request that he provide the voice of Wheatley. Merchant agreed to the role. Wheatley's characterisation was always designed with a British voice in mind. While they were writing Wheatley's dialogue, they had Merchant \\"in their heads\\" as a result of watching Extras, though at the time they did not consider pursuing him for the role because they did not think that they would be able to cast him. They were instead considering Richard Ayoade, up until they went to Merchant's agents. Wheatley was also designed with the intention of writing a video game character who spoke informally which Wolpaw stated gave the sensation that the events were really happening and that this was something players do not often see in video games. He also stated that sidekicks in video games have never \\"sounded as if they were just making things up as you go along\\". While they later discovered that Merchant was famous in the United Kingdom, they noted that he was not chosen for his fame. Wolpaw noted that Merchant was the most famous actor that they had featured in one of their games. While they wrote a script for Wheatley, Merchant had an \\"improvisational style\\" that they let him employ in the dialogue. Merchant also spoke some of the written dialogue in a way that seemed improvisational, such as in the \\"reading and repetition of words\\". This was one of the qualities that made them want to cast Merchant. Merchant himself has compared Wheatley's personality to characters typically played by Woody Allen, and noted that while initially he didn't know the gravitas of the role, reaction by others made him take the role a lot more seriously. He described the recording sessions as \\"exhausting\\", so much so that by the end he was \\"not looking forward to it\\", but once the project wrapped, he was overwhelmed with the fan response and would return for a sequel. Original plans had Wheatley remain dead after being crushed by GLaDOS, with her remaining as the main antagonist. The player would then meet six other spheres‚Äîincluding a paranoid sphere and a \\"Morgan Freeman sphere\\". This was changed, however, as the other spheres did not have enough time for the players to grow attached to them, and because playtesters missed Wheatley. Appearances=Portal 2 Wheatley is one of several personality cores created for GLaDOS; specifically, he was designed by the Aperture scientists as an \\"Intelligence Dampening Sphere\\" (or, as GLaDOS puts it, \\"the dumbest moron who ever lived\\") as a means to hamper GLaDOS' decision-making processes by injecting poor judgment into her routines. The player-character Chell is introduced to Wheatley when he revives her from her cryonic hibernation, with the intent on helping her escape the deteriorating Aperture Science facility. Wheatley then helps Chell get the blue portal gun. Wheatley leads Chell to the chamber containing the remains of GLaDOS, and accidentally reactivates GLaDOS while trying to engineer their escape. Chell is separated from Wheatley by GLaDOS and forced to perform more tests. Wheatley manages to rediscover Chell and helps her escape to maintenance areas behind the testing chambers out of GLaDOS' reach. He guides her to destroy GLaDOS' neurotoxin supply and sabotage the turret manufacturing line before returning to GLaDOS. Without these hazards to stop her, Chell follows his instructions to transfer his core into that of GLaDOS. With the threat of GLaDOS quenched, Wheatley prepares to send Chell to the surface, but he becomes power-hungry due to GLaDOS' core programming; he places GLaDOS' personality into a module powered by a potato battery and sends her and Chell into the depths of Aperture Science. As Chell and GLaDOS fall, GLaDOS reveals that Wheatley was actually meant to be a \\"tumor\\", with the purpose of generating an endless stream of bad ideas in order to control her. While Chell and GLaDOS work their way up from deep underground, Wheatley begins fumblingly experimenting with his control of the facility, causing several key systems to fail. By the time Chell and GLaDOS arrive, the core reactor in the facility is set to overload, and the only way to stop it is for GLaDOS to retake her main unit back from Wheatley. Wheatley, coerced by the core programming in GLaDOS, puts them through a series of deranged test chambers in his newly renamed \\"Wheatley Science\\" facility, leading them to a series of death traps. Chell and GLaDOS are able to escape, due to Wheatley's lack of foresight, and make their way to his chamber to try to attempt a reversal of the core transfer, but first must subdue his programming by three other faulty personality cores to distract him. Wheatley, recalling the earlier battle with GLaDOS, takes steps to prevent Chell from activating the core transfer mechanism and assaults her with bombs. However, he did not account for tubes carrying the various gels through the room, which Chell destroys with the bombs and uses the resulting spillage to complete the attachment of the corrupted cores. With Wheatley distracted, Chell tries to initiate the core transfer, however bombs rigged in the stalemate resolution annex explode before this can take place. As the failsafes on the reactor core fail, the roof collapses. Chell creates a portal between the room and the moon's surface, dragging her and Wheatley's module through it; GLaDOS, now having regained her body, knocks Wheatley away, and then restores the facility to normal working order. Wheatley is shown in the game's epilogue to be floating adrift in space, apologetic for the trouble he has caused, and forced to listen to the deranged ramblings of the space personality core. Other games Wheatley appears in an official plug-in created by Valve for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim; Fall of the Space Core, Vol 1. Wheatley appears floating around the Skills Menu, the backdrop of which is a series of constellations in potato. Wheatley appears in Valve's multiplayer shooter Team Fortress 2 as an item for the Spy class called \\"The Ap-Sap\\". Stephen Merchant reprised his role as Wheatley for the game. He appears as a non-playable character in Lego Dimensions, with Stephen Merchant once again reprising his role. In the main story campaign, he appears in Aperture Science and occasionally aids Batman, Gandalf and Wyldstyle in escaping and surviving GLaDOS's traps. In the bonus Portal-themed stage, Wheatley is now able to move and levitate under his own power; he is reunited with Chell and accompanies her through GLaDOS's new test chambers, expressing remorse for his previous actions and trying to ingratiate himself with Chell. He also appears in the Portal 2 adventure world, caring for a group of Frankenturrets and offering the player various sidequests. Reception Stephen Merchant received significant praise for his portrayal of Wheatley. Stephen Merchant won two awards for his performance as Wheatley: 'Outstanding Character Performance' at the Interactive Achievement Awards and Best Performance by a Human Male at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards. Wheatley earned a Spike TV nomination for 'Character of the Year'. Edge staff wrote that Merchant's portrayal of Wheatley was \\"neurotically stuttering and blubbering\\" and that his \\"idiosyncratic staccato Bristolian burr\\" was a \\"fascinating choice\\". Edge staff also wrote that he served as the game's \\"comic relief\\" and called him \\"alternately hapless and sinister, the mesmerizing animations of his ‚Äòeye light‚Äô and a changing role throughout make him an unforgettable presence\\". GameSpy's Will Tuttle wrote that Merchant's portrayal of Wheatley was \\"pitch perfect\\" and is \\"sure to be a fan favorite\\". The Telegraphs Tom Hoggins wrote that the \\"delightfully skittish\\" Wheatley's \\"casual, nervous patter reacting naturally to the events unfolding around you\\" was performed well by Merchant. He later wrote that the dialogue of Portal 2 was funny due in part to \\"the way that the frantic, nervous babble of Wheatley contrasts so effectively with the cynical, sinister goading from GLaDOS\\" and that neither are overbearing. The Guardians Nick Cowen wrote that Wheatley was a \\"stammering, motor-mouthed droid\\" and at times \\"funny and monstrous and spine chilling\\". The Guardians Will Freeman wrote that the \\"apparently sentient computers\\" in Portal 2 are \\"outstanding\\" though players may have a \\"divided opinion\\" on Wheatley. An editor for The Province wrote that Merchant's portrayal of Wheatley \\"really adds to the personality and character of the game\\". Official Xbox Magazines Jon Hicks praised the narrative of Portal 2 and cited Wheatley's \\"chirpy idiocy\\" as a contributing factor to its quality. OXMs Ryan McCaffrey wrote that Wheatley was \\"played to perfection\\" by Merchant. Computer and Video Games Andy Robinson wrote that Wheatley's personality was \\"equally loud\\" to GLaDOS and \\"brilliant\\". GameZone's Ben PerLee wrote that Wheatley was \\"cute but stupid\\" and called him \\"adorable and bumbling, a lovable little guy who is much more involved than you might expect\\". The Escapists Russ Pitts wrote that Wheatley was \\"a helpful ‚Äì if dumb ‚Äì robot companion with a chipper English accent\\". The Globe and Mails Chad Sapieha wrote that Merchant was \\"enormously entertaining as a slow-witted sphere\\". Ars Technica's Ben Kuchera wrote that \\"the casting [of Merchant] was a brilliant choice\\". He also wrote that \\"there is something about his delivery that works wonderfully, and it seems like he was having a good time recording his lines\\". PC Gamers Dan Stapleton praised Wheatley as \\"fantastically voiced\\" by Merchant and wrote that he was \\"basically playing the same mind-bogglingly stupid character from the Ricky Gervais comedy Extras\\". PC Gamers Craig Pearson wrote that \\"his nervous English voice ... is another indicator that while Valve might not have known what they had with the original Portal, this time around they‚Äôre a lot more confident\\". Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis wrote that Merchant voiced Wheatley with \\"terrific nervous energy\\". Wireds Chris Kohler wrote that \\"you'll fall in love with Wheatley, a friendly robot with a heart of gold and the charming voice of actor Stephen Merchant\\". IGN's Charles Onyett wrote that it's \\"difficult to overstate how Merchant's obvious enthusiasm for the role benefits the game\\" and that \\"no word Wheatley speaks is without witty inflection, and the consistently clever writing perfectly complements the onscreen action\\". He also wrote that Merchant's Wheatley \\"steals the show\\" while GLaDOS and Cave Johnson's voice actors Ellen McLain and J. K. Simmons turn in solid performances. PALGN's Adam Ghiggino wrote that Merchant's performance was \\"brilliant\\" and that he has \\"a lot of emotion to [his] movement\\". Video Gamer's Jamin Smith expressed that Merchant's voice was 'familiar' and wrote that Wheatley \\"possesses more personality than the cast of most other games put together\\" despite \\"a lack of any distinguishing features at all\\" in its appearance. GamesRadar's Tyler Wilde wrote that Wheatley was \\"surprisingly expressive\\" and called it \\"bumbling\\". CNN's Larry Frum called Wheatley \\"silly, frantic and almost childlike\\". ABC News' Lou Kesten called it \\"equally memorable\\" to GLaDOS and a \\"chatty, nervous A.I.\\" Entertainment Weeklys John Young described its eyeball's appearance as a \\"giant blue eyeball resembles a HAL 9000 computer with an Apple makeover\\". He also wrote that he was the \\"most delightful artificial-intelligence program one could hope to meet, and his witty quips and general clumsiness are a frequent source of amusement\\" and that he is \\"splendidly voiced\\" by Merchant. Editors for CNET wrote that \\"if Stephen Merchant doesn't win every video game voice actor award for his portrayal of the protagonist's wacky robot sidekick, there is no justice in either this world or any virtual one\\". An editor for CBS News wrote that Wheatley was \\"chirpy and well-intentioned\\" but also \\"dim-witted\\". The editor added that the \\"interactions between the player, GLaDOS and Wheatley are what give \\"Portal 2\\" its charm and provide much of the humor that keeps the game captivating puzzle after puzzle\\". However, not all of Wheatley's reception has been positive; in an article by Ars Technica, Peter Bright stated that the character's role in the game's plot was 'predictable' and that \\"his tireless, relentlessly stupid schtick\\" got old quickly, with the character's jokes being 'repetitive', further stating that Wheatley's \\"inane babble served only to disrupt the mood\\".

Her sister Georgina, the Moncreiffes' third daughter, known to the family as \\"Georgy\\", became Countess of Dudley, her husband having been dubbed \\"frizzle wig\\" by Lady Mordaunt. In 1920 Margot Asquith recalled that \\"groups of beauties like the Moncrieffes ... were to be seen in the salons of the 'eighties. There is nothing at all like this in London today\\".The Autobiography of Margot Asquith, Volume I (1920). Beginning with the Moncreiffes, Mrs. Asquith named several other beautiful groups and individuals, including the Conynghams, Lady Randolph Churchill, mother of Winston, and Lady de Grey, later Marchioness of Ripon. While observing that London society was \\"neither better nor worse\\" in 1920 than forty years earlier, she was unable to think \\"where all the beauty has gone to!\\" Sir Thomas Moncreiffe served in the Grenadier Guards and become a captain in the Atholl Highlanders. He was captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club at St Andrews. The atmosphere at Moncreiffe has been described as \\"free and easy\\". During her childhood Lady Mordaunt was acquainted with Albert Edward, Prince of Wales,Deborah Fisher (2005) Princesses of Wales and, after his marriage to Princess Alexandra of Denmark in 1863, attended informal parties, including dances at Abergeldie Castle,Georgina Battiscombe (1969) Queen Alexandra near Balmoral, which the Prince used as his Highland home.E. F. Benson (1930) As We Were: A Victorian Peepshow In November 1865 she was invited to Sandringham, the Waleses' house in Norfolk, and subsequently joined the Prince and Princess on various occasions in London. Lady Mordaunt grew up to be pretty and flirtatious,Obituary of Sir Richard Hamilton, Daily Telegraph, 3 October 2001 but also headstrong and, ultimately, rather unbalanced.Christopher Hibbert (2000) Queen Victoria: A Personal History Marriage Walton Hall, Warwickshire, home of Sir Charles and Lady Mordaunt On 6 December 1866, at the age of 18, Lady Mordaunt married Sir Charles Mordaunt, 10th baronet (1836‚Äì1897) at St. John‚Äôs Episcopal Church in Perth. Sir Charles was a Conservative M.P. for the two-member constituency of South Warwickshire from 1859 to 1868. Through his brother, John Murray Mordaunt (1837‚Äì1923), who played cricket for Warwickshire and I Zingari, he was the uncle of three other cricketing Mordaunts, H.J. (Sir Henry Mordaunt, 12th baronet), E.C. and G.J., who all appeared at county level.Benny Green (comp., 1986) The Wisden Book of Obituaries; Sir Pelham Warner (1946) Lord's 1787‚Äì1945. H.J. was notable also for throwing a goal in the Eton Wall Game of 1885 (Wisden, loc.cit.) and was a member of the shooting party on which Viscount Drumlanrig, son of the Marquess of Queensbury, supposedly committed suicide in 1894 (a verdict doubted by Mordaunt as technically impossible) (Leo McKinstry (2005) Rosebery: Statesman in Turmoil). The couple lived at Walton Hall, Warwickshire, which, to mark his coming-of-age, Sir Charles had commissioned in the fashionable Gothic Revival style from the architect George Gilbert Scott,Daily Telegraph, 3 October 2001 who later designed St. Pancras station in London.John Betjeman (1972) London's Historic Railway Stations A descendant of Sir Charles once counted 72 bedrooms at Walton.Roger Wilkes, \\"House of fun: Walton Hall, Warwickshire\\", Daily Telegraph, 16 January 2002 They also had a residence in Belgrave Square, London. The Mordaunts remained part of the so-called \\"Marlborough House set\\" who were associated socially with the Prince and Princess of Wales. According to later legal reports, Sir Charles made a ‚Äúhandsome‚Äù settlement on his wife at the time of their marriage and initially they appeared to live ‚Äúmost happily together‚Äù. However, it became clear subsequently that Lady Mordaunt was in the habit of entertaining male guests alone while her husband was absent on Parliamentary business or engaged in his various sporting pursuits. Extramarital activities and birth of a daughter The Mordaunts had toured Switzerland together early in their marriage, but when, in June 1868, Sir Charles prepared for an annual fishing trip to Norway, Lady Mordaunt encouraged him to go on his own. Arrangements were made for her to remain at Walton Hall in the company of a sister and another lady. However, when Sir Charles returned early from Norway, he found his wife alone. One of her maids later testified that, during Sir Charles's absence, Lady Mordaunt had been visited in London by Viscount Cole (later 4th Earl of Enniskillen), who, after dinner, had \\"remained alone with her until a very late hour\\"; on another occasion, he had travelled with her by train from Paddington station to Reading, where he alighted from a carriage of which they had been the only occupants. Other servants, who seem to have resented Lady Mordaunt's behaviour, added their own accounts of Lord Cole‚Äôs visits. E-book Parliament rose on 28 July 1868, and in November Sir Charles did not stand for re- election. The Liberal Party swept to power at the first general election since Disraeli's Reform Act of 1867.Roy Jenkins (1995) Gladstone By then, Lady Mordaunt was five months pregnant. On 28 February 1869 she gave birth prematurely to a daughter, Violet Caroline.The Daily Telegraph, 3 October 2001 & 16 January 2002. The timing was significant, in view of Sir Charles's absence on a fishing trip the previous year. Doctors initially feared that the child might be blind, causing Lady Mordaunt to become hysterical, imagining that this had been brought about by a hereditary sexually transmitted disease.Michael Havers, Edward Grayson & Peter Shankland (1977, revised 1988) The Royal Baccarat Scandal (At the time, gossip surrounding Freddy Johnstone, a close friend of the Prince of Wales, whom Lady Mordaunt shortly afterwards claimed to have been one of her lovers, was that he suffered from such a disease.) Violet‚Äôs eye infection was successfully treated and no venereal infection was found in either mother or child. However, following this episode, Lady Mordaunt declared to her husband, \\"Charlie, I have deceived you; the child is not yours; it‚Äôs Lord Cole‚Äôs\\". She further claimed to have committed adultery with \\"Lord Cole, Sir Frederick Johnstone, the Prince of Wales and others, often and in open day\\".Keith Middlemas (1975) Edward VII As one of Princess Alexandra‚Äôs biographers put it, \\"the ensuing scandal was immense\\". Involvement of the Prince of Wales The Prince and Princess of Wales on their wedding day, 1863 Sir Charles forced the drawer of Lady Mordaunt's writing desk and found a number of letters to her from the Prince of Wales. It was plainly unwise for the Prince to have written these and, throughout his life, he seems to have had trouble resisting such communication with women he admired.James Brough (1975) The Prince and the Lily. However, their content (though very similar to the sort of things he wrote some years later to his mistress, Alice Keppel) was innocuous.Sarah Bradford (1982) Disraeli When published later in provincial newspapers and The Times, they were judged to be \\"simple, gossipy, everyday letters\\"; a biographer of the actress Lily Langtry, another of the Prince's mistresses, observed that \\"typical lines to Harriet might have come from a benevolent uncle\\". There is a widely recounted story of Sir Charles' returning to Walton Hall to find his wife in the company of the Prince and two white ponies, which, following the Prince‚Äôs expulsion from the premises, he had shot in her presence.For example, Edward VII: Prince of Pleasure (BBC2 TV, 2 April 2011); Jane Ridley (2012) Bertie: A Life of Edward VII p. 123 However, although Sir Charles acted very bitterly towards the Prince, he did not cite him in any legal action and so formal contemporaneous accounts of Lady Mordaunt‚Äôs activities tend to skirt around such episodes. Legal proceedings Sir Charles commenced proceedings for divorce on 20 April 1869. In view of her nervous and erratic behaviour after Violet‚Äôs birth, of which full details were given by her servants, Lady Mordaunt‚Äôs family claimed that she was insane and unfit to plead. A counter- affidavit on behalf of Sir Charles maintained that she was feigning a mental disorder. On 30 July 1869, Sir Thomas Moncreiffe, acting as his daughter‚Äôs guardian ad litem, formally alleged that, at the time the summons was served on her, she was \\"not of sound mind\\". In her diary entry for 6 August, Princess Alexandra noted that \\"a commission has been ordered to investigate and report if Harriet Mordaunt is truly mad\\".Quoted in Battiscombe, op.cit. Mordaunt v. Mordaunt, Cole & Johnstone (1870) Lord Penzance, judge in the Mordaunt divorce case The resulting caseSee An Official Report of the Cause C√©l√®bre: Mordaunt v. Mordaunt, Cole & Johnstone (Evans, Oliver & Co., 1870) came up for trial before Lord Penzance in the Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes on 23 February 1870. Having been summoned to appear as a witness, the Prince of Wales was examined for seven minutes by Lady Mordaunt's counsel, the first time that a Prince of Wales had given evidence in open court. While admitting visits to Lady Mordaunt while her husband was away, Jane Ridley ( 2012) Bertie: A Life of Edward VII pp 125‚Äì127 he flatly denied any \\"improper familiarity\\" or \\"criminal act\\" with her ‚Äì \\"Never!\\" ‚Äì and was not cross- examined by Sir Charles's counsel, William Ballantine. The Prince had sought advice about whether to accept the subpoena from, among others, the Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench, Sir Alexander Cockburn, who in advising him to do so, described Lady Mordaunt as \\"a lady of such apparently fragile virtue\\" and referred to the notion that \\"one to whom a woman has given herself up is bound, even at the cost of committing perjury, to protect her honour\\".Quoted in Souhami, op. cit. Dominic Sandbrook, writing in 2012 shortly after revelations about Prince Harry of Wales's involvement in a game of \\"strip billiards\\" in Las Vegas, observed of the Prince of Wales's denial of impropriety with Lady Mordaunt that \\"nobody, of course, believed him\\" and that, by comparison, \\"Prince Harry looks a model of chastity\\" (Sunday Times, loc. cit.) After a trial lasting seven days, and including evidence from the psychiatrist Dr Thomas Harrington Tuke, the jury determined that Lady Mordaunt was suffering from \\"puerperal mania\\" at the time the summons was served on her and that she was unable to instruct a lawyer in her defence. Accordingly, Sir Charles's petition for divorce was dismissed, while Lady Mordaunt was committed to an asylum. A conspiracy? The finding of insanity gave rise to suspicions that there was a conspiracy to silence Lady Mordaunt.Roy Hattersley (2004) The Edwardians. By way of comparison, during the Profumo affair almost a century later, Mandy Rice-Davies famously remarked \\"He would, wouldn't he?\\" when it was put to her in court that Lord Astor had denied her allegations relating to house parties at Cliveden: Oxford Dictionary of Quotations (5th edition, 1999), 626:9. Reynold‚Äôs News, for example, asked why the Prince (\\"a young married man\\") should have been \\"so eager to pay weekly visits to a young married woman when her husband was absent, if it was all so innocent?\\"Quoted in Souhami, op.cit. There is some evidence that the Establishment closed ranks at a time when republican sympathies in Britain and Ireland had been aroused by Queen Victoria‚Äôs virtual withdrawal from public life.Dorothy Thompson (1990) Queen Victoria: Gender & Power; Miranda Seymour, Sunday Times Culture, 6 November 2011 (reviewing Helen Rappaport (2011) Magnificent Obsession: Victoria, Albert, and the Death that Changed the Monarchy). In 1867 Victoria had been booed and hissed on her way to open Parliament: Rappaport, op. cit.. It seems that, in advance of the trial, the Prince's Household received private assurances that his position would be protected as far as possible, and, some years later, his private secretary, Francis Knollys, recalled that the Prime Minister William Gladstone had been involved indirectly \\"and successfully\\" behind the scenes.Michael Havers, Edward Grayson & Peter Shankland (1977, revised 1988) The Royal Baccarat Scandal at page 253. Souhami, op. cit., attributes this observation to Knollys's father, Sir William Knollys, who was the Prince of Wales's comptroller (she says private secretary) at the time of the Mordaunt case. However, Francis Knollys appears to have reminded the Prince during the baccarat scandal of 1890 of the \\"indirect\\" and \\"successful\\" nature of Gladstone's involvement twenty years earlier: Havers, ibid.. The Queen strongly disapproved of her son's (and daughter-in-law's) lifestyle, writing to her eldest daughter, the Crown Princess of Prussia, on 2 March 1870 that \\"they lead far too frivolous a life and are far too intimate with people ‚Äì with a small set of not the best and wisest people who consider being fast the right thing\\".Quoted in Battiscombe, op. cit. She seemed especially concerned (with, as Roy Hattersley has put it, \\"admirable understanding of the moral superiority of the lower orders of society\\") that the affair could damage the Prince's reputation in the eyes of \\"the middle and lower classes\\".Quoted in Hattersley (2004) The Edwardians However, Victoria seems to have been convinced of her son's innocence regarding Lady MordauntLytton Strachey (1921) Queen Victoria and remained staunch in his defence, as did Alexandra, who described him to her sister-in-law Princess Louise as \\"my naughty little man\\",Letter to Princess Louise on her engagement to Lord Lorne, October 1870, quoted in Battiscombe, op.cit. but was nonetheless deeply hurt by the affair. For his part, Gladstone observed rather despairingly to his Colonial Secretary, Lord Granville, that \\"in rude and general terms, the Queen is invisible and the Prince of Wales is not respected\\".Quoted in A. N. Wilson (2003) The Victorians; Thompson, op. cit. Lord Granville became Foreign Secretary in July 1870 following the death of Lord Clarendon: Sir Llewellyn Woodward (1938) The Age of Reform 1815‚Äì1870. Attitudes to Lady Mordaunt's mental condition Historians have taken differing stances on the extent of Lady Mordaunt‚Äôs mental illness. Diana Souhami (1996) reflected on Cockburn‚Äôs pre-trial observations that neither her \\"fragile virtue\\" nor \\"honour\\" were protected; that her \\"punishment\\" was to be declared insane; and that \\"it proved expedient to call her mad and bad\\". However, Michael Havers, a future Lord Chancellor who published in 1977 an account of the Prince‚Äôs involvement in the Tranby Croft baccarat scandal of 1890, commented that, by the time the Mordaunt case came up, Lady Mordaunt was \\"quite obviously insane\\" and that her physical condition had also deteriorated.Havers et al, op. cit. Lord Havers was briefly Lord Chancellor in 1987. In the 1960s, the historical biographer, Elizabeth Hamilton, whose husband, Sir Richard Hamilton, 9th baronet (1911‚Äì2001) inherited Walton Hall in 1961, found a vast consignment of papers there that she used as the basis of a book about the scandal. She took the view that Lady Mordaunt probably did fake her madness at first, but added that \\"if you feign insanity, it can become a habit, and you can genuinely go mad\\".Daily Telegraph, 16 January 2002 Reviewing Lady Hamilton's book for The Sunday Telegraph, Nicola Shulman, Marchioness of Normanby, observed that \\"the sly unhindered crimes committed against Harriet Mordaunt make plain what rights a woman was owed in 1869\\".Quoted in Pan edition of The Warwickshire Scandal (2000). Shulman added that she hoped it was not \\"another crime to have relished the story as much as I did\\". After the trial=Asylum at Chiswick Records of the census of 1871 reveal that Lady Mordaunt was living on the western outskirts of London, at the Manor House asylum in ChiswickElizabeth Hamilton (1999) The Warwickshire Scandal, pp398-404 whose clinical director was Thomas Harrington Tuke. Tuke was, at the time, one of the most respected practitioners in lunacy and, together with the Prince of Wales' physician, William Gull, played a prominent role in the Mordaunt case;Obituary of Thomas Harrington Tuke, British Medical Journal, 28 June 1888 his previous patients included the Chartist leader Feargus O‚ÄôConnor,BMJ, 28 June 1888 the painter Sir Edwin Landseer and Sophy Gray, sister-in-law and muse of the painter John Everett Millais.Suzanne Fagence Cooper (2010) The Model Wife In evidence to the court, Tuke had been clear in his assertion that Lady Mordaunt was suffering from puerperal insanity, regarding her confessions of serial adultery with several men up to a few weeks before the birth of her daughter as typical delusions associated with that condition. Divorce There is very limited information available about Lady Mordaunt‚Äôs life between 1871 and her death in 1906. After various legal appeals, including to the House of Lords (in the judicial capacity that it exercised then), Sir Charles Mordaunt‚Äôs petition for divorce was remitted to the original court on the basis that Lady Mordaunt‚Äôs insanity was not, as a matter of law, a bar to proceedings. Eventually, in 1875, Sir Charles was granted a divorce on the grounds of his wife‚Äôs adultery with Lord Cole, who did not contest the action. In 1878 Sir Charles married Mary Louisa Cholmondeley, the daughter of a parson. Final years In 1877, she was then moved from Chiswick to Hayes Park Private Asylum, Hillingdon,See Andrew Roberts, The 1832 Madhouse Act and the Metropolitan Commission in Lunacy from 1832, http://studymore.org.uk/mhhglo.htm Hayes Park 1850 Report p.395 New licence granted to Dr William Conolly at Hayes Park for 10 male patients and 10 female patients. 1852 William Conolly retired and his son in law, Charles Fitz- Gerald, took over. 1859 Licensed to Charles Fitz-Gerald with 8 male and 6 female patients. 1859 to 1861 John and E.T. Conolly took on the licence. 1867 Comments: \\"Hayes Park, which was formerly licensed for patients of both sexes, is now appropriated exclusively to the reception of 18 ladies. The house is large, the park and grounds extensive and the accommodation generally is of a superior class. There are generally 7 or 8 of the ladies who dined at Mr Benbow's table, and with hardly an exception all have had the opportunity of carriage drives. Last year a house was taken at Bognor and 6 of the patients passed some time there\\" 1868 Ordnance Survey map: \\"Hayes Park Private Lunatic Asylum\\" shown on the west of parkland at corresponding coordinate (509600:182300) to present Hayes Park. 1870: Mr & Mrs Benbow 1.1.1874: licensed to Mr Benbow with 14 female patients. 1881 Census: Henry F. Winslow. Physician. Hayes Park, Hayes, Middlesex attended by Dr Edward Benbow. The Census of 1881 shows Harriett Mordaunt still at Hayes Park, Hillingdon, described as a boarder along with several other patients of aristocratic title. However, the Census of 1891 has her at a private residence known as \\"Hampton Lea\\", Langley Park Road, Sutton, Surrey, her name now abbreviated to the initials HSM (as was accepted practice for those afflicted by lunacy). It is noted that her place of birth is incorrectly given as West Sussex. She appears to have an attendant. The Census of 1901 still has Harriett Mordaunt at \\"Hampton Lea\\", her name now shown as Harriett \\"Morgan\\" with the same incorrect place of birth and described as a widow, probably a reference to the death of Sir Charles, her former husband, in 1897. It seems that she no longer comes under the Lunacy Act, as her name is now fully entered, but is shown as mere \\"feeble-minded\\". Harriett Mordaunt died in May 1906. She is buried at Brompton Cemetery.The Brompton Cemetery Burial Register shows grave reference AJ/129.6/148.6, and describes her address as Langley Park Road, Sutton. Daughter and descendants Lady Mordaunt‚Äôs daughter, Violet, lived at Moncreiffe after her mother's detention at Chiswick. Sir Charles appears to have taken no direct interest in her, although he did make provision for her maintenance as part of a wider settlement after his divorce that included also a sum towards Lady Mordaunt's care. In 1890 Violet married Viscount Weymouth, later 5th Marquess of Bath. Neither her mother nor Sir Charles was present at the wedding and, despite his continual refusal to acknowledge Violet, Sir Charles appears to have been offended by the Moncreiffes' decision not to invite him. However, there is some evidence that, at Christmas the previous year, Lady Mordaunt (by then referred to as \\"Miss Moncreiff\\") was allowed out of detention to meet her future son-in-law. Violet died in 1928. Her son Henry, the 6th Marquess, described by Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire as \\"the handsomest man you ever saw\\",Deborah Devonshire (2010) Wait for Me! was one of the \\"bright young people\\" of the 1920sD. J. Taylor (2007) Bright Young People: The Rise and Fall of a Generation 1918‚Äì1940. Emphasising a streak of unconventionality in the family, a biographer of the Mitford sisters, of whom \\"Debo\\" Devonshire was the youngest, has referred to Henry (a casual friend also of Nancy Mitford) as having been \\"on the fringe of a Bohemian group at Oxford\\": Mary S. Lovell (2001) The Mitford Girls. and became famous in the 1960s for developing a safari park on the family's estate at Longleat. In his entry for Who's Who, the 6th Marquess referred to his mother as the daughter of Sir Charles Mordaunt, but made no mention of Lady Mordaunt.Who's Who, annually to 1992 Violet was the grandmother of the 7th Marquess who is known for his polyamorous relationships and, according to Diana Mosley, was \\"the image\\" of the 5th Marquess.Letter to Nancy Mitford, 29 July 1966: The Mitfords: Letters Between Six Sisters (ed. Charlotte Mosley, 2007). In the same letter, Lady Mosley referred to the opinion of her husband, Sir Oswald, that the 7th Marquess, then Viscount Weymouth. was \\"the exact double of the Ld Weymouth [Violet's eldest son and brother of Henry, the 6th Marquess] whom he saw killed near him in the first war\\" (ibid.)

It is located in eastern Clare. In the 1880s the Bodyke evictions were widely publicised. Village The village of Bodyke lies in the foothills of the Slieve Aughty mountains. Its name may come from \\"Both-Teig\\" (Teig's hut). Parish The Roman Catholic parish of Bodyke is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe. The modern parish incorporates the medieval parish of Kilnoe and the southern part of the medieval parish of Tuamgraney, which may have been combined early in the 18th century. Bodyke is noted for its local church, the Church of Our Lady of the Assumption, which was originally built in 1844. The church of St Joseph's serves Tuamgraney. Schools are Bodyke National School, Scariff Community School and Tuamgraney National School. The Raheen Community Hospital in Tuamgraney is a public nursing home and day center. Bodyke evictions In the 1880s Colonel O'Callaghan, the principal landowner at Bodyke, had refused to lower the rents he charged his tenants. They were in distress. In June 1887 O'Callaghan called for police assistance in evicting the tenants, who resisted by force, witnessed by large crowds. Thirty-five of his tenants returned to their homes after being evicted. Twenty six people, all but four of them women, were charged with assaulting and obstructing the forces of the law, with sentences ranging from acquittal to three months hard labor. The prolonged affair was widely reported and caused angry debates in Parliament. As one member said, \\"The name of Bodyke stank in the nostrils of the Government...\\" The evictions continued into the 1890s, with goods and livestock seized in lieu of rent. Often the livestock died of poisoning soon after.

Kr√∏yer: Roses (1893) A similar scene with Peder, Marie and Rap in the garden taken at around the same time Roses () is an 1893 painting by P. S. Kr√∏yer, one of the most successful artists of the community known as the Skagen Painters which flourished in Skagen in the north of Jutland in the late 19th century. The work shows Marie Kr√∏yer, the artist's wife, seated in a deckchair under a large rose bush in the garden of a house they rented in Skagen, with their dog Rap asleep beside her. Background The Skagen Painters were a close-knit group of mainly Danish artists who gathered each summer from the late 1870s in the fishing village of Skagen in the far north of Jutland, painting the local fishermen and their own family life, gatherings and celebrations. Peder Severin Kr√∏yer (1851‚Äì1909), who was born in Stavanger, Norway, but brought up in Copenhagen, first arrived in Skagen in 1882 and returned almost every summer, finally settling there permanently after marrying Marie Triepcke in 1889. He had already gained a reputation for his paintings of the fishermen in Hornb√¶k on the north coast of Zealand and had been influenced by the Impressionist movement during his travels to France. In Skagen, he became one of the central and most enthusiastic members of the artistic community creating masterpieces emphasizing the special effects of the local light, particularly in his beach scenes, and painting several memorable works recording the lively gatherings of the artists. Painting The work is oil on canvas and it measures . It is one of a number of paintings, photo studies and sketches that Kr√∏yer made between 1891 and 1894 while he and his wife were renting a house from Madam Bendsen in Skagen's Vesterby; its full title is often given in English as some close variation on Roses. Marie Kr√∏yer seated in the deckchair in the garden by Mrs Bendsen's house (or in Danish Roser. Haveparti fra Skagen med kunstnerens hustru siddende i en havestol). One of the sketches on a similar theme is in the Skagens Museum, and the Hirschsprung Collection has a couple of photographs taken around the same time. Roses was completed in the same year as Summer Evening on Skagen's Southern Beach which shows Marie and Anna Ancher strolling on the beach as the sun sets. In Roses the treatment of the light and shadow shows the influence that the French Impressionist movement had on Kr√∏yer. The foreground is dominated by the huge exuberant Alba Maxima rosebush which obscures most of the house in the background. The variety, of which there is still an example in the grounds of Skagens Museum, does not flower for long but the blooms have an \\"absolutely fantastic scent\\" according to Lisette Vind Ebbesen, the museum's director, who says that Kr√∏yer has captured the bush so perfectly that \\"one can almost smell those roses\\". Marie, framed by the overhanging roses, is shown reading a newspaper; to her left is another empty deckchair which was probably where Kr√∏yer would have sat. The Kr√∏yer's dog, Rap, who featured in many of Kr√∏yer's works (such as the 1892 Summer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore and Summer Evening at Skagen Beach ‚Äì The Artist and his Wife of 1899), lies sleeping at Marie's feet. Provenance In 1895, the painting was exhibited at Charlottenborg and was included in a pamphlet entitled \\"Summer\\" () with Holger Drachmann's poem \\"Sommervise\\". When Kr√∏yer's estate was auctioned in 1910 it passed into private ownership. It was sold for 3.1 million Danish kroner in 1985 and was donated anonymously to the Skagens Museum in 2008.

Shaista Khan was the Mughal subahdar who ruled the Bengal from 1664 to 1688. The exact date of the building of this mosque is not known, but it is assumed that it was built when Subahdar Shaista Khan first came to Dhaka in 1664.Muntassir Mamoon, Dhaka Shomogra-3, 2005, Ananya publisher, , pg-52, 70-71 It is supposed to be built between 1663 and 1678, the first viceroyalty of Khan.Muntassir Mamoon, Dhaka: Smriti Bismritir Nagari (1st Khandha), 2008, Ananya publisher, , pg-258 During the British period the mosque was seriously damaged by an accidental fire. Recently the mosque has been repaired and has lost its original look. An old inscription in Persian fixed over the doorway still stands today, declaring that Shaista Khan erected the mosque. Other details including the dates are unclear. Architecture The mosque is 14.13m x 7.62m in dimension. The mosque has three domes and four octagonal towers. The central dome is larger than the others. It has three doors in east side and one each on north and south sides. All the door are arched. Present condition At present this three domed mosque is still structurally strong and it is lost among the huge structure of Mitford hospital.

Decreased corneal sensitivity, vision loss, and photophobia have also been observed in patients who have worn contact lenses for an extended period of time. Many contact lens-induced changes in corneal structure are reversible if contact lenses are removed for an extended period of time. Knowledge concerning the form and function of the cornea and the various types of contact lenses and their common complications is important to understanding this article. thumbLayers of the Cornea (1) Epithelium (2) Anterior elastic lamina (3) Substantia propria (4) Posterior elastic lamina (5) Endothelium of the anterior chamber contact lenses. Keratitis, or an inflammation of the cornea  Changes in function and morphology  The effects of extended contact lens wear on the cornea have been studied extensively and are well-documented. When determining the effects of long-term contact lens use on the cornea, many studies do not differentiate between users of hard and soft contact lenses, while studies that have made this differentiation have found similar results. This is probably because most contact lens-induced changes to the cornea are caused by hypoxia, which occurs as long as any physical barrier to the surface of the cornea is present. In certain instances, hard contact lenses were shown to cause the same changes in corneal structure as soft contact lenses, though these changes were more dramatic because rigid lenses are capable of inflicting greater trauma on the eyes.  Structural change  Long-term use of soft hydrogel contact lenses has been shown to alter the following in the cornea: epithelial oxygen uptake, epithelial thickness, stromal thickness, and corneal endothelial morphology. Furthermore, the formation of epithelial vacuoles and microcysts has been observed following long-term contact lens wear. Vacuoles are fluid-filled chambers that begin to appear one week after extended contact lens use begins; their number increases over time with extended contact lens wear. Microcysts tend to appear three months after contact lens wear begins and increase in number over time as long as contact lens wear resumes. On average, over five times as many epithelial microcysts than normal have been observed in long-term contact lens wearers. Among patients who have worn soft hydrogel contact lenses for over a year, significant reductions in epithelial oxygen uptake, epithelial thickness, and stromal thickness have been recorded, while an increase in endothelial polymegethism was found. In patients who had worn contact lenses for approximately five years or more, a 30 to 50 Œºm reduction in central and peripheral corneal thickness has been recorded. Furthermore, the reduction was more pronounced in patients wearing hard contact lenses than in patients wearing soft contact lenses. Increased endothelial polymegethism is also found in long-term wearers of rigid gas permeable lenses as soon as one week after contact lens wear begins. This change is indicated by significant increases in Max/Min cell size ratio in contact lens wearers. Endothelial pleiomorphism is another factor that arises from long-term use of rigid gas permeable lenses; significant decreases in hexagonal cells are noted after one year, accompanied by increased numbers of cells of other than six sides. Increased corneal curvature is yet another change known to arise from long-term contact lens wear; this increase in corneal curvature can be as much as 0.5 diopters greater than normal. Corneal surface irregularity and asymmetry are also caused by long-term contact lens wear; these problems are sometimes correlated with astigmatism in contact lens wearers and are thought to be caused by hypoxia, surface molding, and chronic and mild trauma to the cornea from contact lens use. Long-term use of PMMA or thick hydrogel contact lenses have been found to cause corneal warpage (shape distortion). There is some evidence to show that rigid gas permeable contact lenses are capable of slowing myopic progression after long-term wear. This same effect was not found in patients who had worn soft contact lenses for an extended period of time. Greater corneal steepening was found in patients wearing soft contact lenses than in patients wearing rigid gas permeable contact lenses, suggesting that the latter may slow the progression of myopia by flattening the cornea.  Functional change  Corneal sensitivity is significantly diminished after extended contact lens wear (five or more years). However, this difference in sensitivity is not correlated with a change in the number of nerve fiber bundles in the subbasal plexus of the cornea. Long-term use of PMMA or thick hydrogel contact lenses have been found to cause increased eye irritability, photophobia, blurred vision, and persistent haloes. Long-term use of rigid gas permeable contact lenses has been associated with slower myopic progression.  Unchanged variables  The number of corneal keratocytes in the epithelial stroma has not been found to change with long-term contact lens wear. Endothelial cell density also does not change with long-term contact lens wear. No strong relationship has been found between long-term contact lens wear and corneal astigmatism.  Reversibility of damage  Epithelial oxygen uptake has been found to return to normal levels one month after cessation of contact lens wear. Epithelial thickness has been found to return to a normal level as soon as one week following the cessation of contact lens wear. However, endothelial polymegethism does not seem to return to normal levels even long after the cessation of contact lens wear. Even after a six-month period in which contact lenses are not worn, polymegethism seems to remain. Stromal thickness does not return to a normal level even after an entire month in which contact lens wear is halted. The density of microcysts also remains as long as one month after contact lenses are removed, and microcysts do not disappear completely until two to three months after contact lens wear is completely halted. Reductions in epithelial oxygen uptake and thickness are thought to be caused by long-term contact lens wear-induced hypoxia, which hinders epithelial metabolism and mitosis. Recovery of normal epithelial oxygen uptake can occur if contact lens wear is completely halted for one month. Because long periods of contact lens wear are correlated with extended hypoxia, the resurgence of cellular growth and epithelial metabolism following contact lens removal (and hence, improved oxygen circulation) leads to an initial, increased resurgence of microcysts containing cellular debris. Over time, however, microcysts will disappear if contact lenses are not worn. Corneal sensitivity has been found to be significantly diminished following long-term contact lens wear. However, this difference in sensitivity is not correlated with a change in the number of nerve fiber bundles in the subbasal plexus of the cornea, suggesting that diminished corneal sensitivity following extended periods of contact lens wear is not caused by a reduction in nerve fiber bundles but possibly a change in functionality. One or two years of hard contact lens wear has not been shown to affect corneal sensitivity, but real changes are observed following five years of hard contact lens wear. However, this significant decrease in corneal sensitivity appears to be reversible. Following cessation of hard contact lens usage, corneal sensitivity has been shown to be fully regained after several months: patients who had worn hard contact lenses for a decade or longer were able to regain normal corneal sensitivity after four months of not wearing contact lenses at all. Long-term use of PMMA or thick hydrogel contact lenses has been found to cause corneal warpage (shape distortion), increased eye irritability, photophobia, blurred vision, and persistent haloes. Collectively, these symptoms constitute Corneal Exhaustion Syndrom (CES), which is associated with corneal endothelium abnormalities including edema, polymegethism, irregular mosaic, and pigment deposition. Patients with CES suffer from compromised corneal endothelium resulting from chronic hypoxia and acidosis. These problems can be alleviated by providing a patient with lenses that allow for greater oxygen permeability.  Cause  Increases in corneal curvature are thought to be caused by corneal thinning-induced ectasia. Two explanations have been proposed for contact lens-induced stromal thinning. It is thought that contact lens-induced edema may inhibit stroma tissue synthesis. Alternatively, contact lens-induced hypoxia may trigger a lactic acid buildup that leads to the erosion of stromal tissue. The mechanism behind contact lens-induced polymegethism is unknown, though it is also thought to be a byproduct of corneal edema and epithelial hypoxia. It is thought that constant adhesion of contact lenses to the cornea may lead to adaptation to mechanical stimuli, thus decreasing corneal sensitivity to tactile stimuli. A proposed explanation for the reduced sensitivity is the induced quiescence of free nerve endings following long term corneal exposure to contact lenses.

History The work settlement of Monchegorsk in the 1930s was the center of copper and nickel mining in the Monchetundra Massif of the Kola Peninsula, and was administratively a part of Kirovsky District of Murmansk Okrug.Administrative- Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 49 By 1937, the copper-nickel mining volume increased significantly, and, consequently, the area population grew as well.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, pp. 51‚Äì54 On February 19, 1937 the Presidium of the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee petitioned to create new Monchegorsky District by separating the town and its surrounding area from Kirovsky District and to grant Monchegorsk town status. While town status was granted to Monchegorsk by the VTsIK Resolution of September 20, 1937, no new district was formed. On October 10, 1937, Monchegorsk town council was subordinated directly to the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee. On December 21, 1937, the Presidium of the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee again petitioned to create a new district with the administrative center in Monchegorsk. In a letter to the Leningrad Oblast Executive Committee and the VTsIK, the Presidium noted that Kirovsky District has two developed but unrelated industrial centers‚ÄîKirovsk and Monchegorsk‚Äîwith the latter having a larger population and being located away from the former. The petition was again unsuccessful‚Äîwhen on February 10, 1938 the VTsIK adopted a new Resolution changing the administrative-territorial structure of Leningrad Oblast (of which Murmansk Okrug was a part), Monchegorsk remained a part of Kirovsky District. On May 16, 1938, the VTsIK finally issued a Resolution to create Monchegorsky District in Murmansk Okrug of Leningrad Oblast on the territory of the town of Monchegorsky and Imandrovsky Selsoviet. However, since Murmansk Okrug itself was abolished only a few days later on May 27, 1938, the district had not been formed and even the Resolution itself had not been published. Monchegorsky District was eventually formed by the VTsIK Resolution of December 27, 1938, after the creation of Murmansk Oblast. It existed until December 9, 1949, when by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Soviet Union Monchegorsk was elevated in status to that of a town under oblast jurisdiction, with the former district's territory passing into its subordination.

Justin Hunte of BrooklynBodega described You're Welcome as being ‚Äúloaded with personality, slick wordplay, pristine beat selection, and lyricism beyond his years.‚Äù Manny Faces of Birthplace Magazine said \\"lyrically, YC is intelligent and rocks with diction. He enunciates well, emitting just the right amount of emotion for each track, while skillfully staying on message.\\" DJBooth.net declared ‚ÄúYC‚Äôs heavily- alliterated, elaborately-rhymed flows are undeniably dope.‚Äù You're Welcome served as a great look into the talent and potential of the up-and-coming emcee. Fall FWD (2011) Released on March 1, 2011, Fall FWD is the second mixtape by YC the Cynic.

The River Tern flows by. It falls within the parish of Wrockwardine and the borough of Telford and Wrekin. Nearby is the small village of Walcot. The name derives of Aldescote which translates as Aldred's Cottage. There is also a hamlet in Shropshire with the same name, but to the northeast of Bridgnorth and in the parish of Worfield (). In 1927, a sugar beet factory (which came to be owned by British Sugar), once stood in the village and was a major local employer. One of the small steam locomotives that used to work in the factory has been preserved at the Foxfield Railway in Staffordshire. The factory buildings have been demolished since its closure and in 2015, an application to build 470 homes on the site was granted permission by Telford and Wrekin Council. Concerns about overcrowded roads have led to calls for a railway station to be opened on the site as it is adjacent to the Shrewsbury to Wolverhampton Line, but the developers have stated that a railway station is not in their plans. Allscott FC are a football club based at the Allscott Sports & Social Club in the village. The club have recently been accepted for promotion to the West Midlands Regional League Division One, after finishing third in the West Midlands Regional League Division Two (206-17 season). Allscott also finished runners-up in the Mercian Regional League Premier Division (2015-16 season). The club have also won the Shropshire County Challenge Cup on one occasion (2014‚Äì15), as well as the Shropshire County Football League Division One league title (2011‚Äì12).

The district is roughly coterminous with the boundaries of the city of Danville, about in size. It comprises a primary school, intermediate school, one middle school, and one high school and provides educational programs for about 1600 students. The district employs around 350 professional and support staff, of which over 130 are teaching staff. It operates with a budget over $20,000,000. Taxes and other local revenues account for approximately 70% of the budget. Schools ;High school *Danville High School (9-12) 550 students ;Middle school *John W.

Toliver Intermediate (2-5) 600 students Elementary Consolidation The school district formerly had three elementary schools, however at the start of the 2018/19 school year a primary school, and an intermediate school opened. Talks of this had been going on since the 1990s, however the plans had fallen through. During a board meeting in the 2013/14 school year, the plans were restored, as the board decided to consolidate their elementary schools into a primary and intermediate school. They picked Edna L. Toliver Elementary School to host the intermediate grades because it was the biggest elementary school. Construction to add on and renovate the school began in the spring of 2016 and was completed in the summer of 2018. Jennie Rogers Elementary and Mary G. Hogsett Elementary remained as candidates to host the primary school. This sparked a debate about which school would be a better host for the primary school. After much consideration in the fall of 2017, Mary G. Hogsett was selected to host the primary school. This meant that the Board of Education would move into the Jennie Rodgers building. Jennie Rogers Elementary School closed in May 2018, after being open for 53 years. However Hogsett needed renovations to suit primary students. The renovations would last a little over a year, so the Jennie Rodgers building served as Mary G. Hogsett Primary School for the 2018/19 school year. Originally, Jennie Rodgers was to be Danville School's new central office, but over the 2018/19 school year, the school district bought the American National University campus building, right beside Danville High School. Over the summer of 2019, this building was renovated as the district's new central office. The Jennie Rogers building is currently used for storage. Later that summer, Mary G. Hogsett reopened as the primary school. Board of Education The Board of Education has five at-large members. Each member serves a four-year term. Board meetings are usually held the third, and fourth Monday of every month with the public portion of the meeting beginning at 6:00pm.

It was discovered in the leaves of Ancistrocladus korupensis. There are three michellamines represented as A, B, and C; however, michellamine B is the most active against the NID-DZ strain of HIV-2. Occurrence Michellamine A and B occur naturally in Ancistrocladus korupensis leaves. Other chemical substances including alkaloids, tannins, and saponins are found in the roots, leaves, stems, flowers, or bark. Synthesis There are two methods explored to synthesize michellamines A and B. The first one, originally synthesized in 1994, is a retrosynthesis that leads to a biomimetic pathway that uses the construction of naphthalene/isoquinoline bonds before the naphthalene/naphthalene axis. The second method, originally synthesized only a few montes after the first method, is a complementary pathway that would use the naphthalene/naphthalene axis after it is created and add the two isoquinoline moieties. Research Michellamines inhibit protein kinase C and virus-induced cellular fusion.

Today he is considered one of the first theoreticians of physical education in the Balkans. He is also remembered as a revolutionary democrat and one of the leaders of the national liberation and socialist movement in Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Biography Born into a middle-class Serb family, Pelagiƒá was educated at a high school (gymnasium) in Sarajevo and went on to pursue further studies at the Grandes √©coles in Belgrade, graduating from the Faculty of Theology in 1857. In 1860 he served as teacher in Brƒçko where he founded a Serbian reading room, one of the first in Bosnia. From there, via Belgrade, he went to Russia for his post-graduate studies. At the Moscow State University, he attended lectures in political issues facing medicine and history of medicine, from 1863 to 1865. He returned to Bosnia where he served in Banja Luka as an archimandrite and rector of a newly founded Serbian Orthodox Seminary. There he preached progressive ideas and taught gymnastics. His world view was greatly influenced not only by the Russian Revolutionary Democrats but by the decline of the vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire. Brooding upon what he saw as the humiliation of his native land by Turkish sultans and later by Habsburg monarchs, Pelagiƒá conceived the idea of restoring the spirits of his countrymen by the development of their physical and moral powers through the practice of gymnastics. He wrote pamphlets and books which brought together his study of the attitudes of the ancients toward diet, exercise and hygiene, and the use of natural methods for the cure of diseases. He also explained the principles of physical therapy and his Narodni lekar (People's Physician) is considered the first Serbian book on sports medicine. Young gymnasts would regard themselves as members of a kind of guild for the emancipation of their homeland. Exile in Asia Minor The authorities finally realized Pelagiƒá aimed at establishing a united Serbia, and that his school was a political and liberal club. The conflict resulted in the closing of the Seminary in 1869 and Pelagiƒá's arrest on grounds (among other charges) that he taught gymnastics. For the Turks, gymnastics evidently seemed to bear a keen resemblance to military exercises. Kept in semi- confinement successively at the metropolitan's residence in Sarajevo, he was finally sentenced to exile and imprisonment for many years. He spent more than two years in confinement, first he was taken from a Sarajevo prison to northwestern Anatolia in what is now Turkey. From Troy he was transferred to Balikesir in the Marmara region, then back northwestern Anatolia, but this time in Bursa, and finally at the end to Kutahya, where he spent a little more than a year. With the help of the Serbian (Filip Hristiƒá) and Russian (Nikolay Pavlovich Ignatyev) ambassadors in Constantinople, Pelagiƒá succeeded, however, in effecting his escape and reached Serbia in 1871 where he assisted in the organization of the Serbian Liberal Youth Movement, known as Omladina, and then lead their congress in Vr≈°ac. From there he went to Cetinje and assisted in the organization of the Association for Serb Liberation and Unification with Milan Kostiƒá, Jovan Sundeƒçiƒá, Mi≈°a Dimitijeviƒá and many other prominent Serbian intellectuals. There he came into conflict with Prince Nicholas I of Montenegro who did not want to compromise his relations with Russia and other empires. In 1872 he left Cetinje for Novi Sad, Graz, Prague, Trieste and Zurich. Upon his return, he decided to publicly reject his monastic title of archimandrite and in the Serbian liberal journal Zastava (Flag) on 29 April (17 Julian Calendar) 1873 he announced his decision. From then on he became one of the most famous dissenters and anti-clerical activists in the Balkans. Uprising in Bosnia Pelagiƒá took part in the anti-Turkish uprising of 1875‚Äì78 in Bosnia and vigorously protested the occupation of these territories by Austria-Hungary three years later (1878). The rebellion preparations started later than the Herzegovinian, and the actions of the two regions were not coordinated. Among the organizers and leaders were Vaso Vidoviƒá (1840-1925), Simo Bilbija, Jovo Bilbija, Spasoje Babiƒá and Vasa Pelagiƒá. During the 1875 uprisings in Bosnia and Herzegovina, there was a leftist trend that championed a social programme. It was led by Pelagiƒá and enjoyed the support of journalist-anarchists such as Manojlo Ervaƒáanin (1849‚Äì1909), a prominent figure in the Serbian liberation movement and member of the Bakuninist Slavonic Section, Kosta Ugriniƒá (1848‚Äì1933), Pera Matanoviƒá, Djoka Vlajkoviƒá (1831-1883), Jevrem Markoviƒá (1839-1878), Vladimir Jovanoviƒá, and others. Many Italian anarchists were involved in the uprisings (Errico Malatesta himself making two attempts to enter Bosnia-Herzegovina), as well as anarchists from Russia and other parts of Europe. Early in 1875 Pelagiƒá took an active part in the formation of a Free Corps, a volunteer force in the Bosnian rebel army. He commanded a battalion of the corps, though he was often employed in the secret service during the same period. In the 1890s Pelagiƒá helped organize labor societies among artisans and workers which he believed would become the basis for a Serbian socialist party. With a group of like- minded Serbian intellectuals, Pelagiƒá helped found the Belgrade newspaper Socijal-Demokrat in 1895. In his works he advocated socialism and materialist views on the development of nature. Last years After the war he returned to Belgrade where he was appointed state teacher of gymnastics, and took on a role in the formation of the student patriotic fraternities, promoting physical fitness. A man of populistic nature, rugged, eccentric and outspoken, Pelagiƒá often came into conflict with politicians and clerics. Late in life, Pelagiƒá was incarcerated for his anarchistic writings in Po≈æarevac, where he suddenly died. Legacy Vasa Pelagiƒá's influence on the development of physical education and sports in Serbia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina was of great significance. Because of his theoretical and practical work, most of all in the school of physical education he is classified as one of the most important personalities from Bosnia and Herzegovina from that particular era, and within the area of physical culture. He also gave a great significance to the development of theory of physical exercise, physical education in schools, promoted games and other sport activities. He was a first theoretician and a pioneer of modern theory of physical culture in Bosnia and Serbia. Pelagiƒá's role was creating and developing the theory of physical culture in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. During the thirty years of his revolutionary life and lengthy prison terms Pelagiƒá managed to publish numerous books, pedagogic treatises and books aimed at educating people, which brought him fame as \\"the people's teacher\\". Vasa Pelagiƒá's Narodni uƒçitelj (\\"People's Teacher\\") was from 1879 until 1894 published in four editions in circulation of 18,000, while all his other books and booklets reached the circulation of 212,000 before his death, which made him probably the most widely read Serbian writer.Risto Besaroviƒá, \\"Vasa Pelagiƒá\\", p. 190 Alongside a vehement anti-clericalism his books spread early socialist ideas.

He is a fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia and of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. As a testament to Bosworth's contributions to historical non-fiction, the Indian director Gurvinder Singh Sohal immortalised Richard in one of his recent movies as the infamous Ryan Jones from Balham (R.J.B). At the University of Sydney in the 1980s Bosworth was renowned for his ability to pack the General Lecture Theatre 1 for his Late Modern European History course.

Powell, isotype herbarium specimen, 1910 Fucus distichus or rockweed is a species of brown alga in the family Fucaceae to be found in the intertidal zones of rocky seashores in the Northern Hemisphere, mostly in rock pools. Description This is a small tufted brown alga. The fronds are rarely more than 4 mm wideBunker, F.StP.D., Maggs, C.A., Brodie, J.A. and Bunker, A.R. 2017. Seaweeds of Britain and Ireland. Second Edition. Wild Nature Press, Plymouth, UK narrow and grow up to thirty centimetres long. They do not include airbladders as in some other species of Fucus. The fronds are fairly rigid and cartilaginous, partially flattened, and olive green to yellowish green in colour. The plant is branched and has a basal discoid holdfast. The midrib is conspicuous and near the holdfast the stalk is narrowed because of the thickening of the midrib and the erosion of the margins. The apices of the frond are rounded and the swollen receptacles at the tips are yellowish and up to six centimetres long. Two sub- species have are recorded from Great Britain and Ireland: F. distichus ssp. anceps and F. distichus ssp. edentates, each with a distinctive form. The brown colour is due to the xanthophyll, fucoxanthin which masks the colour of the other pigments, beta-carotene, chlorophyll a and c and other xanthophylls. Fucus distichus has a high content of phlorotannins which may protect larger plants from grazing by periwinkles though young plants are susceptible. Distribution In Great Britain, rockweed is found on northern coasts of Scotland and the north and west coasts of Ireland where it is found on rock faces and in rock pools in the upper littoral zone. It also occurs on the eastern coast of North America and on the west coast from Alaska to California. Biology Like other brown algae, there is an alternation of haploid and diploid generations. The haploid thalli form isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous gametes and the diploid thalli form zoospores by meiosis. Reproduction is seasonal, and receptacles start being formed in late autumn in response to short days. The gametes are of both sexes and when released, ova can survive and disperse for several days. It is thought that self-fertilisation often occurs in this species and once a zygote is formed it can only be dispersed over a limited distance. The plant dies back after reproducing and gets washed from its rock substrate by waves during the following winter. A study was undertaken to see what factors influenced natural gamete release and the rate of fertilisation success in Fucus distichus. The study sites were rock pools on the coast of Maine. It was found that the release and settlement of eggs and zygotes occurred during daytime low tide periods, particularly when these fell between 10am and 2pm. Few gametes were released during the night time low tide period nor during the daytime period around noon when there was not a low tide. There was no correlation between the temperature or salinity of the water and gamete release and only a weak association with the lunar phase, few gametes being released around the times of full and new moons. The study showed that fertilisation was successful and in the range 80% to 100% in F. distichus due to the avoidance of gamete release when the water velocity is high under the turbulent conditions of high tide. It has been found that this species grows more abundantly on sloped than on vertical rock faces. Its presence increases species richness as it forms canopies in the mid to high intertidal zone that provide protection, shelter and food for a variety of small invertebrates including many gastropods and crustaceans.

Researchers have come to the conclusion that Altechromone A is a common fungal metabolite with its origin in endophytic fungi. Potential uses For thousands of years, humans have used endophytic species in traditional medicines. Since Louis Pasteur began investigating microbes, science has further revealed the potential benefits of these compounds. Researchers noted that this compound demonstrates both root growth promotion and inhibits bacterial production. Penicillin and other antibiotics effectively treated microbial infections. However, antibiotic misuse has resulted in resistance of pathogens to antimicrobial agents. Altechromone A could provide a source of antimicrobial agents that microbes have yet to develop a resistance to. In addition, the compound could possess anti-tumor capabilities thus yielding more potential medical applications.

Background  Gorecki was born in Bydgoszcz (Bromberg) in the Polish-majority Province of Posen of the German Empire, on October 20, 1871. He attended public schools and immigrated to the United States at the age of eighteen. In 1902 he settled in Milwaukee, worked in the Schlitz brewery, joined the Beer Bottlers' Union and was later transferred to Brewers' Union Local 9. He served as a delegate to the Federated Trades Council from both unions. He became active as a leader of the Polish School Society, which was an anti-clerical organization devoted to public education and the teaching of the Polish language in public schools, and under his leadership served as a base for recruiting for the Socialists.Reese, William J.

E. (1992). Communication, public relations, and effective organizations: An overview of the book. In J. E. Grunig (Ed.), Excellence in public relations and communication management (pp. 1‚Äì28). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, p. 27 The excellence theory resulted from a study about the best practice in public relations, which was headed by James E. Grunig and funded by the Foundation of the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC) in 1985. Constructed upon a number of middle-range theories, and tested with surveys and interviews of professionals and CEOs in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, the Excellence theory provides a ‚Äútheoretical and empirical benchmark‚Äù for public relations units.  Overview  The Excellence Theory explained that the value of public relations lies in organization-public relations. Good relationship with its strategic publics is helpful for an organization to develop and achieve goals desired by both the organization and its publics, reduce costs of negative publicity, and increase revenue by providing products and services needed by stakeholders.Grunig, J. E., & Grunig, L. A. (2008). Excellence theory in public relations: Past, present, and future. In A. Zerfass, B. V. Ruler & K. Sriramesh (Eds.), Public relations research: European and international perspectives and innovations (pp. 327‚Äì347). Wiesbaden: VS Verlag. To maximize value of public relations, public relations must identify strategic publics and build long-term relationships with them through symmetrical communication programs. The Excellence study identified characteristics of effective public relations in four major categories: # Empowerment of public relations function: effective organization must empower public relations as a critical management function # Communicator roles: let public relations executives play managerial role as well as administrative role # Organization of communication function: public relations should be an integrated communication function and separate from instead of being sublimated to marketing or other management functions # Public relations models: effect organization should base its internal and external communication and relationship building on two-way symmetrical model.  Historical Development  The excellence theory evolved from four approaches: goal attainment, systems, strategic constituencies, and competing values, with the competing values approach bridging the gap between strategic constituencies and organization's goals by stating that an organization must integrate strategic constituencies‚Äô values with its goals so that the organization attains the goals of most value to its strategic constituencies.Grunig, J. E., Grunig, L. A., & Dozier, D. M. (2006). The Excellence theory. In C. H. Botan & V. Hazelton (Eds.), Public relations theory II (pp. 21‚Äì62). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.  Goal Attainment  The goal-attainment approach states that organizations are effective when they meet their goals. In 1952, Cutlip and CenterCutlip, S. M., & Center, A. H. (1952). Effective public relations. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. first described the concept of public relations management. In 1954, Drucker proposed management by objectives approach, which warned that managers might get involved in day-to-day activities and forget their main objectives, and suggested that everybody within an organization should have a clear understanding of the organization's aims, and awareness of their own roles and responsibilities in achieving those aims.  Systems  The systems approach here recognizes the importance of environment for an organization to be effective by indicating mutual need between an organization and its environment. According to the open system theory proposed by von Bertalanffy,von Bertalanffy, L. (1950). The theory of open system in physics and biology Science, 111(2872), 23‚Äì29. a system is a complex of interacting elements, and ‚Äúa system is ...open if there is import and export, and therefore, change of the components‚Äù (p. 23). Similarly, organizations are linked with resources in their external environment, and in the meantime, external environment needs products and services from the organizations.  Strategic Constituencies  The strategic constituencies approach identifies the elements of the environment whose opposition or support can threaten the organization's goals or help to attain them. It based on Grunig's situational theory of publics and multi-systems theory of organizational communication. The situational theory postulates that people can be identified and classified according to their problem awareness and information seeking behavior in problems solution process. The situational theory provided a means to segment stakeholders as nonpublic, latent public, aware public, and active public according to their relationship and response to a problem.Grunig, J. E. (2003). Constructing public relations theory and practice. In B. Dervin, S. H. Chaffee & L. Foreman-Wernet (Eds.), Communication, a different kind of horserace: Essays honoring Richard F. Carter (pp. 85‚Äì115). Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press. The multi-systems theory of organization communication explains that it is important for organizations to deal with communication at various system levels, including employee subsystems, consumer system, intersystem relations between employees and a clientele, public relations communications of the total organization, and inter-organizational communication.Grunig, J. E. (1975). A multi-systems theory of organizational communication. Communication Research, 2(2), 99‚Äì136.  Competing Values  Organizational literature shows that organizational effectiveness can be sorted according to criteria of competing values model: # Stability vs. Flexibility: represents debating viewpoints in order, control, authority, versus diversity, individual initiative, and organizational adaptability.Quinn, R. E., & Rohrbaugh, J. (1983). A spatial model of effectiveness criteria: Towards a competing values approach to organizational analysis. Management Science, 29(3), 363‚Äì377. # Internal vs. External: refers to conflict between emphasis on well-being of people in an organization and emphasis on development of the organization itself.Lawrence, P. R., & Lorsch, J. W. (1967). Organization and environment: Managing differentiation and integration Boston: Division of Research, Harvard Business School Press. # Means vs. Ends: emphasis on process like planning and goal setting.  Extension = Global Theory of Public Relations  During the last decade, scholars have replicated excellence study around the world. Results from these studies extended the Excellence theory into a global public relations theory, which provides generic principles that are understood in the same way around the world and can be operated effectively in most nations. The global public relations theory also suggests that practice in different countries should be different based on culture, political system, economic system, media system, level of economic development, and extent and nature of activism in a certain country.  Personal Influence Model  The Personal influence model is developed by Sriramesh, which described practitioners building personal influence with key individuals like government regulators, media, and tax officials by doing favor for them so that they could solicit favors in return when the organizations need help.Sriramesh, K. (1992). Societal culture and public relations: Ethnographic evidence from India. Public Relations Review, 18(2), 201‚Äì211. Sriramesh noted that this model plays a dominant role in many developing countries. Therefore, this model is known as the non-Western model.  Criticism  Many scholars have questioned the possibility of the two-way symmetrical model in real-life context. Van der Meiden Van der Meiden, A. (1993). Public relations and \\"other\\" modalities of professional communication: Asymmetric presuppositions for a new theoretical discussion. International Public Relations Review, 16(3), 8‚Äì11. observed that the two-way symmetrical model is unrealistic since it suggests that organizations should value the interests of their publics more than those of the organization. Murphy Murphy, P. (1991). The limits of symmetry: A game theory approach to symmetrical and asymmetrical public relations In L. A. Grunig & J. E. Grunig (Eds.), Public relations research annual (Vol. 3, pp. 115‚Äì131). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. proposed that the concept of symmetrical communication works along a continuum from pure conflict to pure cooperation, which is based on mixed motives. Leichty Leichty, G. (1997). The limits of collaboration. Public Relations Review, 23(1), 47‚Äì55. argued that completely collaborative public relations is not feasible in some situations, and pointed out that public relations practitioners‚Äô lack of power within an organization further increases the limitation of collaboration. Cameron and his colleagues developed the contingency theory of accommodation, which represent the stance movement of an organization toward a given public at a given time and in a given situation Cameron, G. T., Pang, A., & Jin, Y. (2007). Contingency theory: Strategic management of conflict in public relations. In T. Hansen-Horn & B. Neff (Eds.), Public relations: From theory to practice (pp. 134‚Äì157). Boston, MA: Pearson Allyn & Bacon. and suggests that the true excellence in public relations may result from picking the appropriate point along the continuum that best fits the current need of the organization and its publics.Cancel, A. E., Cameron, G. T., Sallot, L. M., & Mitrook, M. A. (1997). It depends: a contingency theory of accommodation in public relations Journal of Public Relations Research, 9(1), 31‚Äì63.

Dunlop led the left column at the Battle of Seringapatam and commanded the 5th Division at Battle of Fuentes de O√±oro. The Duke of Wellington regarded his retirement from the military as \\"...a real loss\\" though Dunlop subsequently went on to have a successful career in politics. Personal life James Wallace Dunlop was born on 19 June 1759, the fifth son of John Dunlop of Dunlop, Ayrshire and Frances Anna Dunlop (n√©e Wallace), the daughter of Sir Thomas Wallace of Craigie.Heathcote (p.44) In 1784 he became the 21st Dunlop when his father transferred the estates to him. He married Julia Baille, the daughter of a Monkton landowner, on 20 July 1802. They had five children, three sons and two daughters. Dunlop died at his family home Newfield, Southwick, Kirkcudbrightshire, on 30 March 1832. Military career=American Revolutionary War On 16 December 1777, James Dunlop enlisted as an Ensign in the newly established 82nd Foot, a regiment raised from the Duke of Hamilton's estates in the Lowlands, for service in the American Revolutionary Wars.Heathcote (p.44) He was promoted to Lieutenant in January 1778 and was immediately dispatched to Nova Scotia. Dunlop and his regiment were sent to reinforce the British garrison in New York in the beginning of 1779, but their transport vessel was wrecked off the coast of New Jersey and the few survivors, of which Dunlop was one, were all captured. He was later released in exchange for American prisoners, and joined the 80th Regiment of Foot which was then sent to Virginia. In April 1781 Dunlop was dispatched to Charleston with news of the seizure of Chesapeake Estuary, before joining a detachment charged with holding Cape Fear. Following the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, Dunlop commanded mounted troops, covering the garrison's withdrawal from Wilmington. Thereafter he rejoined the 82nd and served on the Halifax Station, where he was promoted to captain on 6 May 1782. With cessation of hostilities in 1783, the regiment was sent home but the troopship again encountered difficulties, shipping water and arriving in Antigua instead. The regiment eventually made it back to Scotland in 1784 when it was disbanded and Dunlop found himself on half-pay. Shortly afterwards however he was given the Dunlop estates by his father and thus became the 21st Dunlop of that ilk. Service in India On 25 December 1787 Dunlop was transferred to India as Captain in the 77th Foot, a regiment drawn mainly from his own estates, and one of four new regiments which, along with the 74th, 75th and 76th, were requested by the Board of Control for the Affairs of India. These regiments were not popular with the East India Company who objected to paying for four regiments that were thought to be surplus to requirements. Initially refused transportation on Company ships, a compromise was agreed whereby half the officers would be taken from the Company's own unemployed officers. Dunlop served under Cornwallis in the Third Anglo-Mysore War against the forces of Tipu Sultan.Heathcote (p.45) He was made Deputy Paymaster-General to the British contingent of the Bombay Army, then later, the military secretary to the Bombay Government. Promoted to Brevet Major on 1 March 1794, Dunlop was confirmed Major of his regiment on 15 September 1795 and promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel of the 77th Foot on 12 December 1795. When news of his promotion arrived in India, Dunlop resigned his staff appointments and rejoined his regiment. After leading a successful campaign in Malabar, he became the senior officer at Kochi Kerala. Dunlop commanded a brigade in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and served at the Battle of Seedaseer 6 March 1799. Dunlop received a severe sword wound whilst leading the left column at the Storming of Seringapatam on 4 May. Tipu Sultan, who was killed during the battle, had his lands redistributed and Dunlop played a role in securing British control of Kanara before returning home in 1800. Service at home There was a brief period of peace following the Treaty of Amiens on 25 March 1802, but hostilities with France were resumed in May 1803. On 25 September 1803, Dunlop was appointed Colonel in the Army of Reserve, which had been raised specifically for the purpose of home defence, and was given command of a garrison battalion. He exchanged regiments again, joining the 59th Foot on 31 March 1804, and was stationed in Kent, guarding the coast against an expected French invasion. He was made Brigadier-General on 11 February 1805 and sent to serve in Cornwall. Peninsular War Having been promoted to Major-General on 25 July 1810, Dunlop played a short but important role with Wellington's army during the Peninsular War. Dunlop commanded a brigade in the 5th Division under Lieutenant-General Sir James Leith, who was succeeded briefly by Major-General Sir William Erskine in February 1811. When Erskine was relocated on 7 March, Dunlop took over and thus led the 5th at the Battle of Fuentes de O√±oro, 3‚Äì5 May 1811. When Wellington withdrew his troops to Portugal in October 1811, Dunlop retired from active service and left for England. Wellington regarded Dunlop's retirement as, \\"...a real loss\\". Political career After returning home, Dunlop embarked upon a political career as a supporter of the Conservative Party, led by Lord Liverpool. Dunlop was Member of Parliament for the Stewardry of Kirkcudbright, during successive parliaments between 1812‚Äì1826.Heathcote (p.46) In 1813, when its charter was due for renewal, Dunlop argued passionately against new requirements being imposed on the East India Company to allow missionaries to enter its territories. Liverpool's party was returned with an increased majority for a further term in the General Election of 1826 but Dunlop lost his seat. He became Lieutenant-General on 4 June 1814 and a Colonel of the 75th Foot on 10 November 1827.

The Lake Chad replenishment project is a proposed major water diversion scheme that would involve damming the Ubangi River at Palambo in Central African Republic and channeling some of the water to Lake Chad through a navigable canal. The canal was proposed by Italian firm Bonifica, and would generate hydro-electricity at several points along its length. These would power new industrial townships, while the canal would replenish the lake. The irrigation scheme for a 2,400 km canal from the Congo Basin to the lake, which has been steadily shrinking, was considered unlikely to materialize as late as 2005. The members of the Lake Chad Basin International Commission are Chad, the Central African Republic, Nigeria, Cameroon and Niger. Concerned by shrinkage of the lake's area from in 1972 to in 2002, they met in January 2002 to discuss the project. Both the ADB and the Islamic Development Bank expressed interest in the project. However, the member states of the Congo-Ubangi-Sangha Basin International Commission, Congo-Kinshasa, Congo-Brazzaville and the Central African Republic expressed concern that the project would reduce the energy potential of the Inga hydroelectric dam, would affect navigation on the Ubangi and Congo rivers and would reduce fish catches on these rivers.  Alternative inland waterway  Congo river, inland navigation system. The drainage basin of the Congo River. An inland waterway from Ubangi River to Chari River), around 366 km channel, from Gigi river (close to Djoukou - Galabadja in K√©mo), through Sibut, Bouca and then to Batangafo (over Boubou river and into Ouham River and then Chari river). This path is the used by the CIMA (Canada) study (water flow 100m3/s) made in contract of the Lake Chad Basin Commission (same water flow as the Moscow Canal), only sizing the channel and adapting the river and lock (water navigation).  Chad-Congo inland waterway This waterway can link the lake Chad with the Congo River inland navigation system and the waterway transport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The navigable waterway system in Congo can be upgraded from Kinshasa to Matadi sea port, already planned as an option in the Inga dams project. As well as it is \\"feasible\\" from Lake Mweru (Pweto city) through Luvua River to Ankoro (requiring dams and Boat lift in Boyoma Falls,... as the Three Gorges dam ship lift), or the waterway into the Lake Tanganyika in Kalemie through the Lukuga River up to Kabalo (Zanza village), now link by railway. * Description of Inland Waterways in the Congo from the UN Joint Logistics Centre  Other World main channels A channel Ubangi-Chari is double the distance of the Rhine‚ÄìMain‚ÄìDanube Canal, but half the distance of the Saint Lawrence Seaway that link the Great Lakes Waterway (waterway from New Orleans to Quebec), three times the Moscow Canal (100-130m3/s) or Volga‚ÄìDon Canal, a third of the Volga‚ÄìBaltic Waterway (that form the Unified Deep Water System of European Russia), and 5 times shorter than the 1974 Km Grand Canal (China) (build in the Sui dynasty).

Soto earned a Bachelor of Arts in Dance from the Gallatin School of Individualized Study at New York University and she received a Masters of Arts in Dance Education from Teachers College, Columbia University. Soto has also studied Kinetic Awareness and Improvisation and Body and Mind movements, which influenced her work. Likewise, she has studied and practiced Yoga since 1986. Soto is the recipient of numerous fellowships and awards including an Artist Fellowship (Gregory Millard Fellow) from the New York Foundation for the Arts in 1998; the New York Dance and Performance Award (Bessie Awards) in 2000 and the Greater Philadelphia Dance and Physical Theater Award (ROCKY) in 2008 for the One Year in Wissahickon Park Project.Meri√°n Soto.

Temple University. 10 March 2011. From 1985 to 1995, Soto collaborated a great deal with MacArthur award-winning visual artist Pepon Osorio. By means of the inclusion of live music, dance, acting, slide projections, film and stage props, Soto and Osorio created interdisciplinary pieces that explored racial and sexual stereotypes and other issues in contemporary Puerto Rican reality and popular culture. Two significant collaborations of Soto and Osorio include Historias (1992), a multimedia work that addresses Puerto Rico‚Äôs history, particularly the impact of colonization, and Familias (1995), also a multimedia work that ‚Äúpoetically meditates on the nature of family.‚Äù Soto and Osorio‚Äôs collaborative pieces also aim to involve the community in both process and product. The participation of eight local Bronx Latino families in the piece Familias as well as the incorporation of local artists and people into the various performances of Historias across the U.S. and internationally reflects how the involvement and participation of the community is a primary aspect in Soto and Osorio‚Äôs pieces. Other signature works of Soto in which she collaborated with Osorio include Puerto Rican Trivia (1987); No Regrets (1988); Referencias (References) (1990) and Broken Hearts (1990). In 1996, Soto began developing works that incorporated popular dance forms, particularly salsa, as both a theme and choreographic technique. Among these are As√≠ se baila un Son (How to Dance a Son Montuno) (1999), Prequel(a): Deconstruction of a Passion for Salsa (2002) and La M√°quina del Tiempo (The Time Machine) (2004). As of 2005 Soto branched out from post-modern, Salsa based dances and into branch dancing. Soto defines branch dancing as ‚Äúa slow meditative performance practice, which involves moving into stillness, the investigation of gravity as essential force, the detailed sequencing of movement through inner pathways and dynamic shifting into balance and alignment.‚ÄùOne Year Wissahickon Park Project. 2009. 20 March 2011.http://www.meriansoto.blogspot.com In essence, Soto‚Äôs Branch Dances investigate the connections between movement, the elements, physical experience, alignment, balance, consciousness, and performance. After having conducted numerous solo, unadvertised branch dance performances in the park, Soto embarked on the One Year Wissahickon Park Project (2007). The One Year Wissahickon Park Project is a series of 16 performances designed around the concept of four seasons, four sites and four performances in each site that took place in Philadelphia's Wissahickon Valley Park from 2007 to 2008. Inspired and informed by her many days spent in Philadelphia's Wissahickon Park, Soto continued her Branch dance series with her most recent pieces Postcards from the Woods (2009) and Winter Dance (2010).

Background Dwight TaylorOliver Taylor was born on January 1, 1903, although his year of birth was later inaccurately cited as 1902. It is given as 1903 on his United States passport application (U.S. Passport Applications, 1795-1925 for Dwight Oliver Taylor Passport Applications, January 2, 1906 - March 31, 1925: 1923 Roll 2244 - Certificates: 279350-279849, 02 May 1923-03 May 1923) as well as his mother's petition for naturalization at New York District Court.

Taylor. Dwight Taylor attended Lawrenceville School in Lawrence Township, New Jersey where he began drawing and painting and wrote a book of poetry. After refusing an opportunity to work as a cub reporter for The New York World, he began his career as a journalist for The New Yorker magazine, serving as one of the first editors for their \\"Talk of the Town\\". He began screenwriting for Hollywood films in 1930 and for television in 1953. His first produced play was Don't Tell George (1928). Other plays included such as Lipstick and Gay Divorce. Taylor's first screenplay was Jailbreak. First National Pictures bought the project in 1929 while it was still in manuscript form and had Alfred A. Cohn and Henry McCarty adapt it to become the 1930 film Numbered Men starring Conrad Nagel and Bernice Claire. Gay Divorce was adapted into a Broadway musical by Cole Porter. In 1934, RKO Studios, which renamed it The Gay Divorcee to appease the censors, filmed it with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. He was a founding member, and had served one term as president, of the Writers Guild of America, West. Death On December 31, 1986, one day before his 84th birthday, Dwight Taylor died of a heart attack at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, California where he had resided since 1981, thus achieving a rare feat of being born on New Year's Day and dying on New Year's Eve. He had been widowed three months earlier by his second wife, former Hollywood costume designer Natalie Visart (born Natalie Visart Schenkelberg; 1910‚Äì1986), with whom he had a daughter, Laurel. His first wife was Marigold Lockhart Taylor (n√©e Langworthy; born July 22, 1901 ‚Äì died 1951?), whom he married on May 25, 1929, and by whom he had three children (Andrew, Audrey, and Jeffrey).

Founded in 1954, Brooklyn Center presented multi-disciplinary arts performances to more than 70,000 people each season. It also boasted one of the largest arts education programs in the borough, serving 46,000 schoolchildren from over 300 schools annually. In July 2018, the organization gave up its nonprofit status, becoming a unit of Brooklyn College's School of Visual, Media, and Performing Arts under the name BCBC / Brooklyn College Presents. On September 6, 2018 (63 days after becoming part of Brooklyn College), the College fired all the staff, and shuttered the organization, citing budgetary reasons. Mission Brooklyn Center's mission is to present outstanding performing arts and arts education programs, reflective of Brooklyn's diverse communities, at affordable prices. A central part of the mission is to introduce young people to the performing arts, to enhance education, and to expose children to new ideas and other cultures. History The rights to the site of Brooklyn College, initially occupied by Native Americans, were transferred to Dutch settlers in 1636 in exchange for one hundred guilders, two-and-one-half tons of beer, three long-barreled guns, and some ammunition. For the next three centuries, homesteaders and farmers occupied the land. In 1924, Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey Circus began to use the grounds for their annual visits to Brooklyn. By 1935, the college secured the property, and in October of that year construction of Brooklyn College began. Since the college served a large, urban and unusually heterogeneous student body, it was immediately obvious to the college administrators that the campus needed a grand assembly hall. During World War II, Brooklyn College's President Harry D. Gideonse wrote a proposal to the City Planning Commission for auditorium funding. The building would contain two performance spaces: George Gershwin Theater, nicknamed the ‚Äúlittle theater‚Äù and the Walt Whitman Theatre. The landscaping of the property followed construction, and by April 15, 1953, the cornerstone was ceremoniously placed in position. Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College (BCBC) is part of a long tradition of cultural excellence associated with Brooklyn. Since many fine artists have roots in Brooklyn, its three main halls are named after famous Brooklynites: George Gershwin, Sam Levenson, and Walt Whitman. Programming Brooklyn Center's annual programs include a World Stages Music and Dance series, Headliners, Theatre, Arts in the Afternoon, Special Events, Target Family Fun, and SchoolTimes Series. Over the years Brooklyn Center has presented more than 150 New York, U.S., and world premieres. Among the performers to grace the stage of the Walt Whitman Theatre are Luciano Pavarotti, Isaac Stern, Gregory Hines, Margot Fonteyn, Beverly Sills, Ray Charles, Joan Sutherland, Tony Bennett, Les Ballets Africains, Isaac Hayes, Vladimir Horowitz, Andr√© Watts, The Temptations, Arthur Rubinstein, the National Dance Theatre of Jamaica, Jos√© Greco, the Moiseyev Dance Company, Suzanne Farrell, Peter Martins, and Itzhak Perlman. Arts education Brooklyn Center offers lower ticket prices to its family performances with the Target Family Fun series. Now in its 25th season, the series is designed to provide parents and caregivers the opportunity to introduce their children to music, theater and dance at affordable prices. In 2009 Brooklyn Center was selected as Best Theatre or Theatre Group for Kids in Brooklyn as part of Nickelodeon's ParentsConnect Annual Pick Awards. Brooklyn Center's SchoolTime series was created more than 30 years ago to fill the gap created by cuts in public school arts programs, particularly in disadvantaged neighborhoods. The series of performances, that take place during the school day, introduce and expose young students ages 4‚Äì14 to educational performing arts programs. More than 46,000 students come to Brooklyn Center each year for SchoolTime performances.

Goldin, The Land is Ours, 1996, Auroroa Films History The traditional Athabaskan potlatch had \\"social, religious and economic significance.\\"William Simeone, A History of Alaskan Athapaskans, 1982, Alaska Historical Commission It was a gathering that combined aspects of competition, peacekeeping and a show of wealth. During a potlatch, members of the society with a surplus of food and supplies provide these for all members of a clan, and in situations with other clans this sharing of resources is either a competitive showing or one of creating loyalties, and sometimes both simultaneously. Traditionally the village was centered on the chiefs' house, and this is where potlatches were held. This was because the chief had the biggest cache where the food was stored.A.E. Stephan, The First Athabascans of Alaska:Strawberries, 1996, Dorrance Publishing, There were many different reasons to hold a potlatch in Athabaskan culture, including the birth of a child, a surplus of food, or a death in the clan. The most elaborate of Athabaskan potlatches was the mortuary or funeral potlatch. This marked \\"the separation of the deceased from society and is the last public expression of grief.\\" William Simeone, Rifles, Blankets, and Beads, 1995, University of Oklahoma Press, There were slight variations in the funeral and mortuary potlatches depending on the status or role of the member of the clan who had died. Different songs and dances were performed for a warrior than for an elder. Because of the tight-knit manner of a group or clan, usually due to extended family ties, the death of an elder, in particular, had a very large effect on the tribe. The corpse would first be dressed by the women of the clan and be prepared, while the mobilizing and putting together of the funeral would be taken care of by the closest male relative of the deceased.Simeone, Identity 183 The preparations would differ but the proceedings of the funerals themselves were generally similar. The potlatch generally consisted of \\"the feast, dancing & singing, oratory, and the distribution of gifts\\".Simeone, Identity 210 The feast was provided by a wealthier member of the group to communicate \\"sentiment, affection, familiarity and goodwill.\\" Dancing and singing were a reciprocation of the guests to the hosts for their generosity. Stories were told in the same manner, and for entertainment. The act of giving out gifts was possibly the most dynamic aspect of the traditional Athabaskan potlatch. This was a generous act of sharing one's wealth with the rest of the tribe, and simultaneously a show of the abundance and superiority of the host. Modern potlatches still contain many of the traditional aspects of sharing food, giving gifts, singing, dancing and telling stories, but now the purpose has changed. Most modern potlatches can be held for similar reasons, such as a birth or a death, but now they are no longer so much a show of wealth, but a celebration to keep the tradition alive. Food As with other aspects of the potlatch, food plays a significant role in the social structure; providing large amounts of food for the guests is symbolic of the host's love and care for his guests, and also for the nourishment he symbolically provides to future generations. Due to the overabundance of food, leftovers are distributed first to elders, then the remainder of the guests. According to Simeone, doing so is \\"a reminder of the host's generosity long after the event.\\"  Preparation  As the potlatch is attended by dozens to hundreds of people from neighboring villages, and is often hosted by one or two people, food and money are given as a gift to the host by family members, to help offset the cost of feeding so many.Thomas Mishler, Crow is my Boss: the oral history of a Tanacross Athabaskan elder, University of Oklahoma Press, 2005 Several men of the village are tasked with hunting moose specifically for a potlatch; it is not uncommon for three or more moose to be killed to feed the guests over the two or three days feasting. One account of a potlatch in the village of Tetlin claimed 22 moose were killed and butchered in preparation of a particularly large feast. In addition to moose meat, many other types of wild food are harvested or donated, such as beaver, duck, salmon, and berries. Traditional subsistence foods provide a reminder of the relationship between the Athabaskan and the land which has historically sustained them.  Meals  Breakfast and lunch are served each day for potlatch attendees and are less formal than the evening meal. Breakfast is offered each morning; eggs, bacon, coffee, and potatoes are common fare. Lunch consists of soup, sandwiches, and tea. The evening meal is scheduled for a specific time and all potlatch attendees are expected to attend. It is the most significant spiritual and social event of the potlatch and is treated as such by the attendees. Large rolls of white butcher paper are rolled out on the floor to serve as place settings and many participants sit next to each other on the floor. Benches and chairs are provided for elders.  Types  Moose is normally cooked by the men of the potlatch. It is served roasted, fried, and as moose head stew, which consists of the meaty portions of the moose's head mixed with vegetables and rice in large stew pots. Grilled and smoked salmon is served, as is soup made from round whitefish. Wild cranberries and blueberries are incorporated into desserts. The traditional wild food is supplemented by store-bought items, most notably black loose leaf tea, which was introduced to the Athabaskan by traders in the 1800s and remains a staple among present day potlatches. Bannock, also known as fry bread, rolls, and salads are also served. Dance The celebration of dance for the Athabaskan people plays a vital role in the success of a potlatch. Unlike many cultures that have changed their mourning over the course of many generations, the Athabaskan people have stayed strong and true to the old ways of song and dance. Dancing is a very important part of Athabaskan culture, and it is often the focal point of the potlatch, particularly after the evening meal. During potlatches a variety of songs are sung; the first songs sung of the weeklong event are called the mourning songs. Traditionally new songs are song first to give thanks to the hosts that are sponsoring the potlatch, followed by the singing of old songs. Poldine Carlo, an Athabaskan from Interior Alaska, noted that \\"The potlatch usually lasted for a week. The first night we would have a big potlatch at the community hall and then the mourning songs were sung, the new songs first for the ones the potlatch was being given for and then the old, old songs that we have been singing for a long time. The women would stand in line all across the hall and dance.\\"Poldine Carlo, Nulato: An Indian Life on the Yukon, Fairbanks, Alaska, 1978 An excerpt from the book Rifles, Blankets, & Beads tells of \\"sorry songs\\" that were sung at a potlatch that took place in Tanacross: \\"At one potlatch in Tonacross, for example, a sequence of sorry songs began with one made especially for the person that had just died. It followed by songs for a young man who died in a house fire 10 years before; a boy who drowned in the river while attempting to draw water and for Elisha's father, who died in the 1960s.\\"file:///home/chronos/u-15985fe980d04ec3ec881e482cd33c8a6e32a755/Downloads/fulltext.pdf The grieving process within the Alaskan Native community is rather unusual, it is shared not just by the family but by both local and neighboring communities. If one member of the family of the deceased does not show up or is late, this is considered to be such a great insult that tribal chiefs have been known to interrupt potlatches in order to publicly shame those who have arrived late or have not communicated with the rest of the community concerning their loss. Grieving is expected to be shared, and thus the burden of grief is lifted from the individual to the group. Dance is the outlet that allows potlatch attendees to vent their grief; \\"sorry songs\\" give way to \\"happy songs\\" and dances, such as the calico dance, where colorful bolts of cloth are passed among female participants, who dance in a large circle. Such dances serve to restore harmony among the relationships within the tribe. Gifts A traditional Athabaskan potlatch is concluded with the giving of gifts. Valuable trade items, traditionally dentalium shells, now largely replaced by rifles, blankets, cash, and beaded items, are collected by the host from members of their mother's moiety and are redistributed by the host to members of his father's moiety in exchange for their contributions of celebration and participation in the potlatch. For instance, an exceptional dancer might be rewarded for her abilities, and likewise a grave digger or pallbearer would be compensated at a funeral potlatch. At the conclusion of a potlatch, gifts are piled high in the center of the meeting hall and distributed to guests. By distributing guns and blankets to the assembled guests, the host demonstrates his relationship to and his feelings for his paternal relatives and potential marriage partners. Through these distributions the host gains prestige as he symbolically ensures his guests' existence by giving them guns to hunt with and blankets to keep them warm. Beaded items are also commonly given as gifts at potlatches, including necklaces, moccasins, gloves, vests, and gun cases. Beads, like the dentalium they have come to replace, are symbolic of social relations that, when expressed in the form of necklaces or sashes, literally surround or embrace the individual. Today Tanacross people see dentalium shells not only as symbols of prestige but also as expressions of affection. While rifles, blankets and beaded items are traditional potlatch gifts, they are not the only ones. Other gifts might include furs, afghans, quilts, moose hide jackets, calico, snowshoes, gloves, hats, coffeepots, enameled plates, snow shovels, suitcases, frying pans and many others both practical and symbolic.Claire Fejes, Villagers: Athabaskan Indian Life Along the Yukon River, Random House, 1981, Dentalium shells and moose hide jackets are often worn by the host while distributing gifts. In some communities, gifts are given out while wearing gloves. If the gloves are kept, it is believed that the wealth will be stored in them, and eventually return to the giver. Often a potlatch host will fully deplete their savings and give away their entire material wealth. The potlatch is an honorable ceremony, and in giving everything away, the host gains prestige. A rich man who does not share his possessions is, to an Athabaskan, a stingy man who is to be pitied.

Starting in the 1998 season Ryan raced at the Simcoe Kart Club in Sutton, Ontario, Canada till 2003. While racing at Simcoe Ryan dominated the Novice/Cadet class with 23 wins in 36 races in a 3-year period. In 2004 Ryan started racing with the Toronto Kart Club at Goodwood Kartways just outside his hometown of Uxbridge, Ontario, Canada. Ryan's karting career came to an end in 2006 at the age of 16 with 10 full seasons of club racing and 4 full seasons of provincial championships. 2007 During 2007 Ryan became his brother, Greg's driver coach. Greg started racing in 1999. 2007 was Greg's most successful season as he competed in the Senior Rotax class. Greg sat on his first pole that year at the Hersey Centre Grand Prix. That would be Greg's last season racing. has he was losing interest growing up. 2008 2008 saw the return of Ryan to the track. He would race a Nissan Sentra in the GT-D class in the Ontario Sprints Championship. Ryan finished 3rd in the championship just 10 points out of 1st, with a best finish of 2nd at Mosport in the rain. Ryan also won the Bob Attrell Best New Driver Award, Barc Rookie of the Year Award, and finished 2nd in the Toyo Tires Championship. Canadian Touring Car Championship In 2009, Blanchet joined his father in the Castrol Canadian Touring Car Championship. Ryan raced very clean all season and had an average finishing place of 9th in the 2009 season, with a best finish 8th at the last race at Circuit ICAR. Ryan finished 7th in the championship in his rookie year which led to the CTCC Touring Rookie of the Year Award. In 2010, Ryan started the season weak finishing outside the top 10 in the first three races. After the race the first few races, Ryan began to pick up momentum, finishing 7th in Toronto. At the last race at Circuit ICAR, Ryan started at the back on Sunday and rose through the field to finish 5th, becoming his best finish in Touring. Ryan finished 8th in points, in the 2010 season. In the 2011 season Blanchet again finished eighth in points.

Monunius attested first in 176 BC was the son of Longarus, a Dardanian king who caused much trouble to Macedonia from 230 BC onwards. He succeeded his brother Bato to the Dardanian throne. Monunius was known for his victory he inflicted on the Bastarnae during the Bastarnae Invasion of Dardania. Etuta the daughter of Monunius married the Ardiaean King Gentius in 169 BC. Since the dynastic marriage relations seem not to have brought an alliance between the two Illyrian States, in 168 BC Gentius allied with Perseus, the enemy of his father-in-law.The Illyrians to the Albanians Neritan Ceka 2005 Many Dardanian kings of the same time were named Monunius and there seems to be some confusionThe Illyrians by J. J. Wilkes, 1992, , page 146, \\"Nor is it certain if this was the same ruler who gained power over the Taulantii\\"...\\"It is not certain if he is the same Monunius who offered helped against the Celts\\" as to whom certain actions and events pertain. Background=Macedonian alliances against Dardania Dardanian State at the time of Monunius Since it was difficult to defeat the Dardanians militarily, Philip V drew up a plan to get the large Germanic/Celtic tribe of the Bastarnae against them. While on campaign in Thrace in 184 BC Philip sent agents to stir up the barbarians along the river Danube, that they might invade Italy.Livy 39.35 Two years later Philip was pleased to learn that the Bastarnae had accepted his alliance and were offering a princess in marriage for one of his sons, Perseus as it turned out. This formidable people, dwelt beyond the lower Danube but were often willing to join in expeditions far from their homelands. The following year Philip mass deportations from Paeonia where he filled the towns with Thracians and other barbarians, as being likely to remain more securely loyal to him in the coming hour of danger,Polybius 23.10 that is war with Rome. In fact Philip's purpose for the Bastarnae was more specific to the security of Macedonia: They were to invade and eject the Dardanians under Monunius and take over their country, and later continue on their way through Illyria, finally reaching Italy. Livy (XL, 574-9) writes that Philip's purpose was to wipe out the Dardanians and settle the Bastarnae in their lands (in the Polog valley), and send them to Italy and lay it waste, leaving their women and children in Dardania. It was a typically ruthless yet realistic scheme, and was later imitated in the Danube lands on more than one occasion by the Romans. The Bastarnae were accompanied by the kindred Scordisci whose lands their route lay. To get the Bastarnae to Monunius' State, Philip had gone to great trouble and expense to arrange safe passage through the Thracians. They left home after a great deal of hesitation but had gone as far as Amphipolis when, in summer of 179 BC, news arrived that Philip V was dead. Soon there was trouble with the Thracians and the Bastarnae retreated to Donica (perhaps Rila), a high mountain in western Thrace. After Philp's death, his son Perseus tried to follow through his fathers plans. After further skirmishes some decided to return home and set off for Appolonia and Mesembria on the Black Sea coast of Thrace, but the rest, under the leadership of Clondicus, pressed on towards Monunius and set about to eject the population in accordance with their arrangement with the late king.'The Illyrians' John Wilkes pg. 151-2 Rome's refusal of help In 176 BC Monunius sent envoys to Rome with news of an invasion by the Bastarnae. The Dardanian envoys declared that they were warriors massive in size and numbers and alleged that they were in league with Perseus and the Gauls. Representatives from Thessaly appeared also in order to confirm the story and back up Monunius. The patres would make their customary response, they would send an embassy to investigate. On the return of that embassy, Livy records that the Romans reported only that a Dardanian war was underway, and Appian adds that they had observed a major military build-up in Macedonia. Perseus in the meantime, dispatched his own envoys to Rome with denials that he had any part in the activity of the Bastarnae.Livy 42.125-6 The senate would neither censure nor absolve Perseus, but simply directed that he take care to giving the appearance of observing his treaty with Rome and therefore the senate did nothing to support Monunius.The Hellenistic world and the coming of Rome, Volume 1 By Erich S. Gruen Bastarnae invasion Map of the Roman empire and contemporary indigenous Europe in AD 125, showing the location of the Bastarnae, divided into two groups. In 175 BC, the Bastarnae supported by the Thracians and the Scordisci, began the invasion and stormed into Dardania. To face the incoming danger, Monunius mobilized all his forces and concentrated them in the city (name of which is not known) closest to the camp of the Bastarnae. Monunius waited for the beginning of winter to launch the decisive strike, when the allies of the Bastarnae would return to their countries. As soon as the Dardanians had learned of their withdrawal, which left on the forces of the Bastarnae, numbering 30,000, on the field, Monunius separated his forces into two armies. The first was to march head on to the enemy and attack them directly, while the other unit was to march along hidden roads and attack from the rear. But the battle began before the second army back to the enemy's back; the defeated Dardanians withdrew to the city, which was just twelve miles from the camp of the Bastarnae. The victors immediately surrounded the city, believing either that the Dardanians would soon surrender from fear or that they immediately take the city by force. Meanwhile, the second of Monunius' army, having made its way unaware of the loss of the first, found the camp of the Bastarnae undefended, and easily took it without any effort.Livy (XLI, 19.4-11) Having lost their entire baggage and supplies, the Bastarnae were obliged to withdraw from Dardania and to return home. Most perished as they crossed the frozen Danube on foot, only for the ice to give way. Among the survivors was Clondicus who had led the people into Dardania four years earlier. Despite the failure of Philip's Bastarnae strategy, the suspicion aroused by these events in the Roman Senate, which had been warned by the Dardani of the Bastarnae invasion, ensured the demise of Macedonia as an independent state. Thus Monunius managed to protect the borders of the Dardanian State which would have perished otherwise. Neutrality Monunius engaged his daughter, Etuta to the Ardiaean King Gentius in 169 BC. However, the marriage does not seem to have secured an Illyrian-Dardanian alliance. Perseus conquered a broad swath of territory in the south of the Dardanian State, also taking the region of Penesta (Polog valley) with its cities Uscana, Oene and Draudachus. In order to stop the Dardanian raids into Macedonia, Perseus burned and destroyed the regions to the north and west of Mount Scardus (Sar Mountains), an area known thereafter as 'Deserted Illyria'. Through these campaigns, Perseus annihilated the military bases that the Romans had built in the north-west of his kingdom, cut off for good the routes the Dardanians had used for their forays into Macedonia, and inserted himself like a wedge between Monunius and Gentius. Since the dynastic marriage relations seem not to have brought an alliance between the two Illyrian States, in 168 BC Gentius allied with Perseus, the enemy of his father-in-law. Nonetheless, Monunius preserved Dardanians neutrality, both in the war between Gentius and Perseus on the one hand and the war with the Romans on the other. After the destruction of Macedonia in 167 BC, the Dardanians ask the consul Paullus Aemilius for control of Paeonia, but he refused, giving them only the right to trade in salt there. Many Dardanian kings of the same time were named Monunius and there seems to be some confusion as to whom certain actions and events pertain.

The cause of death, as determined by the New York City medical examiner's office, was \\"slash wounds\\" to his neck and arm. The cancellation of his employment contract would have meant that Calvo‚Äîa Spanish citizen‚Äîwould lose his residence visa in the US and face deportation. Background Calvo's death has provoked questions regarding why employment was interrupted during the middle of the academic semester. According to an acquaintance of Calvo, on 8 April, a security guard reportedly forcibly removed him from his office and took his keys, and the university barred access to his email account. Later that day students waited in vain for him to arrive to a class he was meant to teach. Calvo, who also taught linguistics, poetics and the arts of the Harlem Renaissance, was being evaluated for reappointment (he did not have academic tenure), and his department had recommended that he be retained. A colleague told the New York Times that a number of graduate students and a fellow lecturer had mounted a campaign to block his renewal, on the basis of comments alleged to be harsh and inappropriate. An entry in Calvo's notebook from 9 April referred to concerns about his having \\"raised [his] voice to subordinates\\"; Calvo had supervised the work of graduate student instructors who in his view sometimes did not work hard enough. Colleagues and students told the New York Times that Calvo sometimes used Spanish expressions that might have been offensive to people who did not understand their connotation in Spanish culture. A letter from his department chair told him he would receive a call from an associate dean to schedule a meeting at which the allegations would be discussed. The university administration, in a statement by president Shirley Tilghman, has declined to answer questions or provide details about the reason for the termination, alleging reasons of confidentiality, and members of Calvo's department have allegedly been instructed not to speak about it (an allegation disputed by the university), leading to dissatisfaction among some groups on campus, particularly among those undergraduates who revered him. Friends of Calvo have alleged that the administration is \\"hiding something\\" and refer to \\"vicious politics\\". Writers in Spain have observed that Calvo's story bears similarities to a number of academic novels, including Philip Roth's The Human Stain.

Biography Born to Rudolf and Theresa Peyerl on August 11, 1983, Martin Peyerl and his sister Daniela lived with their parents on a busy street in Bad Reichenhall, Germany. After the shooting, no clear motive has been presented for Peyerl's actions. Peyerl's status as an outsider at school, and that he had an alcoholic father at home who was frequently unemployed, have been regarded as possible influences. Peyerl was an avid gun enthusiast and frequently purchased gun magazines. He told classmates that he sometimes went to the forest looking for birds \\"to shoot\\" and sometimes practiced shooting with his father in the garage. Rudolf Peyerl, a twelve-year veteran of the German Army, was himself enthusiastic about firearms, owning as many as nineteen. A few months prior to November 1, Martin was temporarily expelled from school because of Nazi photographs pasted in his notebook. Neighbors said that Peyerl was a normal albeit introverted boy, but a psychiatrist who was involved in this case spoke of a loser type. Descriptions of Martin by former classmates were strikingly similar to descriptions given by classmates of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. He is said to have been a shy loner who preferred playing video games over talking to people. One classmate, Stefanie Hocheder, said \\"Martin was always nice\\", but that he was largely ignored and rarely had anything to say. Another said Martin was \\"a bit of a right-wing\\". Given the similarities between the shooters at Columbine and Martin Peyerl and the short amount of time between their respective rampages, it is possible Peyerl was influenced by the massacre at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999. Martin commented one day leading up to November 1, 1999 that it was \\"completely crazy what these guys have done\\" and that he believed Harris' and Klebold's actions to be \\"something we should do\\". The shooting Ruger Mini-14 On November 1, 1999, Peyerl's parents left the house to visit the grave of one of Peyerl's grandparents in Piden, something they typically did on All Saints Day. Martin did not go with them. Instead, in their absence, he broke into his father's gun cabinet- which contained more than ten firearms- positioned himself in his bedroom window, and began shooting at anything that moved. Peyerl killed neighbors Ruth and Horst Zillenbiller, then a 54-year-old patient at the hospital across the street when he stepped outside to smoke. Seven others were ultimately wounded, among them actor G√ºnter Lamprecht. Martin's sister, a nanny at the hospital across the street, came home at around noon. According to police, a struggle of some kind occurred between the two, ending when Martin shot his sister five times and killed her. He then fatally shot the family cat, sat down in a bathtub, and committed suicide with a single blast from a shotgun. Police stormed the house at 6:00 p.m., finding the bodies of Daniela and Martin Peyerl along with the cat. An enormous swastika was painted above Peyerl's bed; in his room were a number of additional painted swastikas and other Nazi symbols. A number of videos and CDs with violent content were also discovered. A portrait of Adolf Hitler hung above the bed of Peyerl's sister. Aftermath Numerous politicians in Germany called for changes in German firearm legislation following Peyerl's indiscriminate shooting on November 1, 1999. Rudolf and Theresa Peyerl were interviewed as witnesses by police shortly after, and the German Kriminalpolizei started an investigation. Wolfgang Giese, head of the investigation, denied the chance that drugs, alcohol, or extreme right-wing ideology were behind Peyerl's actions, saying those things played \\"no role\\". Instead, Giese asserted, the problem was \\"in the personality of the offender\\". Investigators concluded that Martin Peyerl, like Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, did not commit murder-suicide as a spontaneous act, but likely planned his actions well in advance. Peyerl left behind no journal or videos as the Columbine killers did, however, leaving his actions for the most part a mystery. Despite this, investigators remained certain that Peyerl's own death was as much a part of whatever plan he devised as the indiscriminate shooting of others.

He appeared on the Bangladesh literary scene in the 1970s. His themes revolve around the war of liberation and the eternal subjects of love, nature, motherland, mother-tongue, tradition, and modernity.Foreword by National Professor Kabir Chowdhury, Selected Poems of Bimal Guha, Shamabesh, Dhaka, , pp ix,.  Biography  Bimal Guha was born in Bajalia Union under Satkania Upazila of Chittagong District. He is the eldest among the four children of Prasanna Kumar Guha and Manadabala Guha. They are: Bimal, Nirmal, Niyati and Amal. Bimal had his early education at local Bajalia High School and passed SSC in 1968. He had his Higher Secondary Education at Satkania College and passed HSC in 1970. later he received his MA in Bengali literature from the University of Chittagong in 1975. Also He had his higher education in publishing at the Napier Polytechnic of Edinburgh (Napier University), UK. Bimal also received training in editing and publication from Philippines and Thailand. He earned his PhD in modern Bengali poetry from the University of Dhaka in 1997.  Literary career  Bimal Guha entered the literary arena in 1968 while he was in school. He read the Sanchaita (collected poems) by Rabindranath Tagore during his leisure time after his secondary examination. He was inspired and began writing. His first poem, Akash (The Sky) was published in Rashmi, the Satkania college magazine, in 1969. Shortly after, his poems began to appear in different literary periodicals and literary sections of the daily newspapers. His first book of poems Ahongkar, Tomar Shabdo (\\"Pride, Your Words\\") was published in 1982. His style changed and he sought new perspectives from one volume to another. The imagery, simile, metaphors and symbolism that Guha applies in his poems imply the probabilities of his speciality in creating an individualistic style in the poetic world of Bangladesh.Preface by Siddique Mahmudur Rahman, Selected Poems of Bimal Guha, Shamabesh, Dhaka, , pp xii,. He has 32 books to his credit; his works include poetry, research, travelogue, edited books and more than 100 articles on literature and culture. Uncompromising in life-struggles, Bimal never bends down to the ungraceful. He has revolting fire in himself; he struggles with quick-sand all through his life. During the 1970s, especially after the liberation war of Bangladesh, some young poets transformed Bangladesh poetry into a newer consciousness and human rejuvenation, and developed the expression of art to arrest time and space into a newer vision; Bimal Guha is remarkable among them. He is associated with many literary and cultural organisations including the Bangladesh Writers Club, Editing and Publication Association of Bangladesh, Asiatic Society of Bangladesh and Bangla Academy.  Critical acclaim  Poet-Critic Shudhasattwa Bose of West Bengal, India remarked on Bimal Guha's poem- \\"Since the seventies, poems developed a newer feelings and understanding, poetic diction has changed, delivery of words and phrases has totally changed overnight. It has started a new journey without touching the old totally. We can take references from Bimal's poems\\".Ekok (monthly journal) edited by Shudhasattwa Bose, vol. 44 no 1, 1392 (Begali Era). Professor Syed Manzoorul Islam has described in an introductory note- \\"Bimal Guha's poems are about the problems of our time, more particularly about the difficulties of adjustment that a feeling and thinking individual faces in an increasingly alienating world. As values are forgotten or become obsolete, and relationships become problematic, individuals have to struggle to cling to their dreams. Guha writes movingly about love which can offer a way out but which is constantly thwarted by a mechanical universe. Guha also writes about the need for social change. What makes his poems remarkable is his crisp style which both invokes the rich tradition of the 1930s and charts its distance from it. His diction is personal, contemporary and colloquial. His poems are indeed records of a creative pursuit that excels when it find challenges\\".Introduction by Professor Syed Manzoorul Islam, Selected Poems of Bimal Guha, Shamabesh, Dhaka, ix . British poet Benjamin Zephaniah has remarked in an interview- \\"Bimal's poetry is so conversational, and he is also very passionate about the poetry of Bangladesh\\".In Conversation with Benjamin Zephaniah by Ahmede Hussain, Jan 22, 2007  Personal  Bimal Guha married Meena Guha in 1980. They have three daughters: Ishika, Upoma and Mithila.

Now he has been teaching at the Department of Printing and Publication Studies of the same University.

It was constructed in the beginning of the 20th century in Renaissance architectural style. It was built as the house of the governor of East Bengal and Assam. After the construction of the building, the advisor of the Indian government said that it was not suitable for a governor's residence. It was then used as a general office and was given to Intermediate College. The High Court Building was built after the division of India in 1947.  History  The Governor's house at the south end of Ramna Oval (green), popularly known as the Old High Court Buildings, was built as the official residence of the Governor of the newly created province of East Bengal and Assam in 1905, though he never really lived there. Its location was selected by (Lieutenant) Governor Designate Sir Joseph Bampfylde Fuller himself, who saw it only befitting to put the building opposite the ongoing Curzon Hall building at the edge of expansive Ramna Plains, while the new Secretarial Building (the present Dhaka Medical College and Hospital) was under construction on the west after triangular Dhaka College field (current Dhaka University Stadium). Until 1853 the Governor- General of India, appointed by the East India Company, was also acting as the Governor of Bengal Presidency. From year till 1911, the position of a Lieutenant Governor was introduced for the provinces including for Bengal. However, the position of Governor-General of India was changed to Viceroy to be appointed by the British Parliament. It was again a Governor for ruling reunited Bengal since after 1911. The present Dhaka University VC's house was built as the residence of the lieutenant governor. Approached through an elegant triple arched gateway and formal garden, the mansion had series of rooms of various sizes, aligned on four symmetrically laid out wings over looking a square inner court and connected double storied corridors. It is entered through porch under a triangular pediment supported on Corinthian columns. A graceful lantern dome, found in many such civic buildings of the period in England, and also in Ahsan Manzil, rising behind the pediment in the south elevation, crowns the building. In plan the building is nearly symmetrical with a square entrance hall, a number of drawing rooms and a ballroom. A broad bifurcated staircase from the entrance hall leads to the second floor that has four large bedrooms with wide verandas on both the north and south sides. In all, the building is a fine example of the Renaissance style of architecture. By the time it was completed, annulment of the partition of Bengal was very much in the air, and hence the authority including the chief architect was not sure how to furnish it. Thus it ended up set up with minimum office furniture, and therefore Lieutenant Governor Bailey did not like it. Hence the building either lay vacant or carried some official business before along with several other major buildings around (initially built to house administration) being given to Dhaka University. The Governor himself preferred to stay at the temporary lodge further east in Dilkusha. The original governor's house was used by the (Dhaka) Intermediate College, while the University was occupying the Curzon Hall and the adjacent chemistry laboratory, first given to the college. Across the street College road to the east of Curzon hall area reminds us that the largest original tenant of the area was the Dhaka College to build a bad University. Dhaka College started in 1841 as Dhaka Central College at the premises of an English Seminary School(Collegiate School) in its extended first floor, within 5 years a new building was built for it, which in 1908. It gave away to the Curzon Hall. When Dhaka University started, the college was shifted to the High Court Building . During the Second World War, it was shifted to an old structure in Siddique Bazar, and later to its current location near the new market. After the college was shifted, the Governor's house saw many changes in use Dhaka University council (Senate) building, next as the High Court Building, later in the 1980s as the Defence Ministry office. For sometime after 1947, Brigadier Ayub Khan had his camp behind this building. With the construction of a larger facility in the 1960s nearby that now houses the Supreme Court of Bangladesh and Attorney General's office, the High Court was shifted from here in 1967. Currently this building serves as the office of the Ministry of law and Parliamentary affairs and the Law Council.  Architectural significance  Interior staircase This is the finest example in Dhaka of the European Renaissance style with few or no Mughal features. It has a prominent central porch under a triangular pediment which is supported on Corinthian columns. The building is surmounted by a graceful dome which rests on a ring of columns. On entering the building through this porch there are two wide verandahs on either side of the 28 foot square entrance hall, which is paved with white marble. Beyond is a broad staircase, also flagged with white marble which leads to the upper storey. On the west of the entrance hall are a couple of drawing rooms of similar dimensions, measuring 25 by 34 feet, and these rooms are terminated by a north-south oriented verandah and a long corridor around a large rectangular inner courtyard. On the east, there is a ball room which measures 60 by 55‚Äô-0‚Äù and is fronted by a verandah on the south. The inner central courtyard is overlooked on both the east and west wings by long covered corridors and a circular projection in the centre of each wing, whilst the two-storeyed northern wing facing south, accommodates four large bedrooms measuring 28‚Äô-0‚Äù x 17‚Äù-8‚Äù and 25‚Äô-0‚Äù x 16‚Äù-0‚Äù with dressing rooms and bathrooms between them. These also are flanked by two 9‚Äô-8‚Äù wide verandahs on both the front and back. A staircase through the middle of the north wing leads to the upper storey. There are two spiral staircases at the corners of the quadrilateral blocks. The entire flooring on the ground floor is of white marble except for ballroom which is of polished teak timber planks. The edifice presents a graceful example of the European Renaissance style as adapted to suit this country.  Present condition  It is now under the control of Supreme Court. Now it is divided into two parts, one part is being used for crime tribunal and the other part for law commission.  Address  The Old High Court is situated at High Court Street, opposite the picturesque Curzon Hall, and skirting the Ramna Green, Dhaka.

Bargaining is traditionally defined in economic terms of negotiating conditions of a purchase or contract and is sometimes used in place of direct monetary exchange. Bargaining process within a family is one of the important aspects of family economics. Bargaining also plays a role in the functioning and decision making of households, where agreements and decisions do not often have direct monetary values and affect various members of the household. Household dynamics The household is traditionally described as a single economic unit that \\"works as a group for its own good\\", meaning all members of the household contribute in an altruistic manner towards the benefit and functioning of the entire household. The household is \\"the basic residential unit in which economic production, consumption, inheritance, child rearing, and shelter are organized and carried out\\". Though it is not always synonymous with family, in the case of intra-household bargaining, in which members of the household are considered to be one unit, the household is generally synonymous. Because a household is composed of various individuals, conflicts of interest arise. These conflicts of interest make bargaining a necessary fact of household life and create a household environment that is not universally governed by altruism. These conflicts of interest have the potential to create a spectrum of intra-household dynamics, ranging from a non-cooperative to a cooperative household (which is directly reflective of game theoretic bargaining models). In the non-cooperative model, each household member acts in order to maximize his or her own utility; in the cooperative model, households act as a unit to \\"maximize the welfare of their members\\" (described above as altruism). Bargaining power Bargaining power is \\"the relative capacity of each of the parties to a negotiation or dispute to compel or secure agreements on its own terms\\". In other words, \\"if both parties are on equal footing in a debate, then they will have equal bargaining power\\", and, conversely, if one party has an advantageous position in the debate, the parties have unequal bargaining power. More specifically, what determines the equality or inequality of bargaining power is the relative fallback positions or \\"threat points\\" of the individuals in the bargaining process; that is, which bargainer has more to lose (economically, socially, etc.)? In the context of intra-household bargaining, an individual's bargaining power and fallback position are defined by one's ability to survive and thrive outside the family. Factors that determine fallback positions= Extra-household parameters  The structural support, whether institutional or societal, an individual has outside of the household determines how capable one would be of surviving outside the household. * Individual's rights/access to communal resources: Communal resources are entities such as village commons or public forests from which individuals and households alike may acquire resources (e.g., firewood or water) that are necessary for daily subsistence. * Existence of social support systems (see also social networks): Social support systems are friendship, familial, caste, and any other social groupings from which one derives emotional support, benefiting the individual's overall health and increasing their ability to survive well outside of the household. * Support from the state and non- governmental organizations (NGOs): State and NGO support could increase an individual's intra-household bargaining power by the creation of a social safety net. The work of states, NGOs, and a social safety net can increase \\"access to employment, assets, credit, infrastructure, etc\\". *Social norms and \\"perceptions about needs, contributions, and other determinants of deservedness\\": The social acceptability (or lack thereof) of leaving the household or living in a non-traditional household, the perceived social needs of individuals within the household, and the low valuation of certain tasks, such as care work, all regulate the bargaining power an individual has within the household, because these factors directly impact the individual's ability to survive outside the household.  Individual assets  The access one has to individual assets, both economic (such as property, land, wealth, or earning ability) and personal (such as labor), determines fallback position because it is directly linked to one's capability of surviving outside the household. In South Asian societies land is one of the most valuable individual assets that can increase an individual's bargaining power, yet it is more uncommon and difficult for women to own land than men for a number of reasons: inheritance laws that allow women to inherit land are not strongly enforced, in order to own land individuals must obtain a certain level of education, which women have traditionally not had access to, and owning land and enforcing laws depends upon one's \\"economic and physical access to legal machinery\\" as well as access to government officials. Due to the unequal gender rights to land ownership, South Asian women are less capable of providing income to the household which lessens their bargaining power in the household. In some societies, there is a custom of housewife hidden savings as a counter to inequality.  Social norms and gender perceptions  Due to the traditional role of women in South Asia as caretakers in the household rather than workers bringing an income to the household, women are not socially perceived as deserving of more opportunities because worth correlates with wealth and not the quality or amount of work one has done.  Inequalities in bargaining power  Unequal access to strong fallback positions creates a situation in which different individuals within the household have more or less bargaining power, and therefore have more or less influence over household decision-making. When considering the factors that determine fallback position in intra-household bargaining and what populations have access to positive fallback positions, Bina Agarwal's research in rural South Asian communities shows that their women have less access to strong bargaining power and their interests are not reflected in household decisions. Game theory Within the household unit and in the mathematical study of game theory, scholars have defined two distinct types of bargaining: cooperative and non-cooperative. In cooperative bargaining models (also called collaborative decision making), the outcomes of negotiations are more equally beneficial to all members of the household, and have therefore been considered a more \\"natural\\" means of analyzing the family unit in comparison to non- cooperative models. In non-cooperative bargaining models (also called unitary decision making), personal interests motivate individuals within the household rather than the desire to work in a collaborative manner and maximize the benefit of all household members.

Life Born on 14 December 1792, at an early age he entered the literary department of the publishers Longmans. Brought up a member of the Church of England, of which his elder brother was a clergyman, Cromwell became about 1830 a Unitarian; and, being ordained, was from 1839 minister of Newington Green Unitarian Church, where he officiated for twenty-five years. He also held during the greater part of his ministry the office of clerk to the local board of Clerkenwell, from which he retired with a pension. In 1864 he resigned the pulpit at Stoke Newington, and soon afterwards took charge of the old Presbyterian congregation at Canterbury, over which he presided till his death on 22 December 1870. He was buried on the 28th of that month in the little cemetery adjoining the chapel. During the last two years of his life he had acted as honorary secretary of the Birmingham Education League. By his wife, the daughter of Richard Carpenter, J.P. and D.L. for Middlesex, he had no issue. Works In 1816 he published a small volume of verse, The School- Boy, with other Poems, which was four years later followed by privately printed copies of Honour; or, Arrivals from College: a Comedy.

Early life He began his own web design business at the age of 13. At 16, he was animating cartoons for The New York Times website. He left school in 2000 having developed software for processing online payments securely just as a worldwide boom in Internet shopping was occurring globally. Internet tycoon In 2004 Tzvetkoff teamed up with lawyer Sam Sciacca, a cousin of former federal Labor MP Con Sciacca, to run Intabill. Sciacca would handle the business side while Tzvetkoff focused on the software and product development. Intabill quickly became one of the world's largest online billing companies. He appeared on the 2008 edition of the BRW Young Rich List. His business had grown \\"10 to 20 per cent\\" every month since its inception. Five thousand clients in 70 countries - many of them online gambling operators - were using the company's technology to take payments from customers. With the large amount of cash flow from processing Sciacca & Tzvetkoff began to make a number of large investments. In early 2008 Tzvetkoff & Sciacca formed Hugo Services and Trendsact in partnership with Curtis Pope (formerly Selling Source) and John Scott Clark (Impact Payments). The payday lender was named after Tzvetkoff‚Äôs son (Hugo). Hugo Services was launched with over $27m USD in capital loaned from BT Projects the parent company of Intabill. Hugo (the company) was a runaway success, more than doubling in value over its initial nine months of operation to over $60 million. Hugo Services was formed Quid pro quo in exchange for Pope and Clark forming upstream processing relationships for Intabill. They would process the Poker transactions in exchange Intabill would invest in the payday lending partnership. Hugo Services was set up in Las Vegas and employed over 150 staff. With the huge success of both Intabill and the payday lending business Tzvetkoff & Sciacca began to invest in numerous properties and businesses. Both businesses continued to expand until late 2008. Intabill's Demise In late 2008 Intabill began to have cash flow issues with a number of upstream processors having large sums of funds frozen by the DOJ/FBI efforts to curb illegal online Poker. In total Intabill had over $20 million frozen or forfeited due to processing for online Poker operators. Around the same time processing volumes began to decline and due to both of these issues Intabill was left owing more to its clients than it had cash flow. By early 2009 Tzvetkoff and Sciacca began to take drastic measures and made the decision to draw down profits from the Pay Day lending business to repay Intabill's clients. A repayment agreement was reached with key clients for a flat sum per week until the amount owing was paid in full. Intabill, Tzvetkoff and Sciacca gave personal guarantees ensuring payment in full. Everything was going to plan until Intabill stopped receiving payments from the Payday lending entity. Unbeknown to Tzvetkoff and Sciacca, Pope had transferred the assets of the Payday lending business to entities that he and Clark controlled. In essence blocking any access to the funds required to pay back Intabill's clients. Sciacca, Tzvetkoff and Intabill Executives urgently flew to Las Vegas to address the issue. On arrival they were greeted by security and locked out of their own offices. Pope and Clark had secretly taken control of the business. Sciacca and Tzvetkoff low on funds, unable to repay their clients or take legal action quickly enough against Pope & Clarke are forced to place Bt Projects into receivership. Legal troubles In 2009 US poker sites Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars complained Intabill owed them money. Full Tilt Poker sued Intabill claiming it had breached its pay down agreement and owed tens of millions of dollars. In late 2008 Sciacca and Tzvetkoff had hired a CFO who was tasked with bringing Intabills books up to date. Until early 2009 Sciacca & Tzvetkoff were unaware of the true financial position of the company. Operating costs had been far more than either had believed, as were the profits lower. In July 2009, Intabill collapsed. Sciacca sued Tzvetkoff for $100 million and claimed he'd mismanaged the company accounts and led Sciacca to believe the profits were higher than they in fact were. In mid-2009 Curtis Pope & John Scott Clark were arrested and later reported Tzvetkoff as being involved to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for money laundering in connection with helping Full Tilt Poker, PokerStars, and Absolute Poker process funds for United States players. Pope was sentenced to 20 Months in Prison and was ordered to forfeit the funds he had siphoned from the Payday lending business. When Tzvetkoff arrived in Las Vegas for an internet billings conference in April 2010, he was arrested. After a few months in United States custody, and facing a possible 75-year sentence for alleged UIGEA violations, he opted to become a government informant.

Accessed April 25, 2011. The target market for the P line is the civilian concealed carry firearms market, as well as being intended as backup weapons for law enforcement officers.Clapp, Wiley. \\"New Kahr PM9 9mm‚Äù , Combat Handguns, September 2002, p.10 - 15. Accessed June 24, 2008. Development When the first Kahr pistols appeared on the market in 1994 they were constructed entirely of carbon steel. Early Kahr models such as the K9 were praised as well-made and solidly constructed, but criticized for their excessive weight, which is a disadvantage in a weapon intended for concealed carry.Clapp, Wiley. ‚ÄúINSTANT CLASSICS‚Äù , Guns & Ammo, March 2004, p.66 ‚Äì 71. Accessed June 24, 2008. Kahr attempted to address these concerns by introducing a line of polymer framed models. Design features As noted above, P series pistols are manufactured with stainless steel slides that ride on steel inserts within the polymer frames, preventing the wear which would otherwise be inherent with metal slide to plastic frame contact. Available ammunition chamberings include .380 ACP (P380), 9√ó19mm (P9), .40 S&W; (P40), and .45 ACP (P45). P series pistols are noted for being very no-nonsense and utilitarian in appearance, with black plastic grips and a brushed stainless or blackened Tungsten TLC stainless slides. Produced by applying a thin but tough protective coating, the TLC patina was labeled \\"Black Diamond\\" in early production, and is valued for its lack of attention-catching light reflection in dim surroundings. TLC coatings also serve to protect the slide from oxidization, nicks and scrapes. P pistols are known for having very smooth and consistent DAO trigger pulls of approximately six pounds, and large and easy to see sights in various configurations, including night sights. Simplified controls exemplified by the lack of a manual safety lever are also positive attributes and contribute to a desirable package for concealment use. The P series is also noted for having a fully enclosed trigger transfer bar. The engineering design work necessary to fit it inside the cramped space of the receiver resulted in several beneficial lockwork changes. One such change was that the cartridge feed ramp had to be offset, which in turn allowed the overall receiver design to be thinner; it also permitted the slide to be more squat with a low bore axis, resulting is less muzzle rise and flip. The PM barrel configuration boasts polygonal rifling, which in theory will last longer and gather less fouling. Overall, an important innate advantage of the Kahr pistol design is that it is identical in function and trigger action across virtually all Kahr models, meaning that once a user becomes familiar with the handling characteristics and feel of one model, the learning curve for mastery of other Kahr firearms is much shorter. Variants=P380 The Kahr P380, chambered in .380 Auto, comes in three main styles: all matte black, black frame with a stainless slide, and a custom engraved Black Rose edition. All three styles come standard with drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights but can also be purchased with drift adjustable tritium night sights. The P380 can also be purchased with a loaded chamber indicator. P9 The Kahr P9 chambered in 9√ó19mm is the original model in the P series. Like other models it comes in two main styles; all matte black or black frame with a stainless slide. Both styles come standard with drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights but can also be purchased with drift adjustable tritium night sights. The P9 can also be purchased with an external safety and a loaded chamber indicator. These added features make it approved for sale in Massachusetts. P40 The Kahr P40 chambered in .40 S&W; comes in two main styles; all matte black or black frame with a stainless slide. Both styles come standard with drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights but can also be purchased with drift adjustable tritium night sights. The P40 can also be purchased with an external safety and a loaded chamber indicator. P45 The Kahr P45 chambered in .45 ACP comes in two different styles; all matte black or black frame with a stainless slide. Both styles come standard with drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights but can also be purchased with drift adjustable tritium night sights . CW Budget Line Kahr also offers the CW series of pistols, which are budget versions of the P series. The CW series is available in .380 ACP, 9√ó19mm, .40 S&W; caliber, and .45 ACP caliber. The major differences between the CW series and the P series are: The CW series uses barrels with conventional rifling, rather than the polygonal rifling employed by the P series. The CW series has a pinned-in front sight, rather than the drift-adjustable dovetail front sight on the P series. Pistols in the CW series are slightly larger than their counterparts in the P series. The CW series have fewer machined contours, and the slide stop is constructed using metal injection molding rather than machined. \\"Kahr CW45\\", Kahr Web site ‚Äì Spec sheets.

Built by order of King Frederick William I of Prussia according to plans by Philipp Gerlach from 1730 to 1735, it was considered as a major work of Prussian Baroque architecture. With a height of almost 90 metres (295 feet), it was Potsdam's tallest building and shaped its cityscape. In addition, the Garrison Church was part of the city's famous \\"Three Churches View\\" together with St. Nicholas Church and Holy Spirit Church. Damaged during the British bombing in World War II, the East German authorities demolished church in 1968. After the German reunification the Garrison Church is currently being rebuilt as a centre for remembrance and reconciliation. The Garrison Church was an important place of Germany's changeful history. Johann Sebastian Bach, Alexander I of Russia, Napoleon and others visited the building. In addition, it served as burial site of Frederick William I and his son Frederick the Great. Potsdam's first freely elected council members met in the Garrison Church, Lutheran and Reformed Protestants founded the Prussian Union of Churches in it, and classical concerts took place there. In Nazi Germany, the building was used for propaganda purposes; at the same time, many 20 July plotters belonged to the Garrison Church parish.  Building  Interior of Garrison Church (1920) Carillon in the bell tower  Bell tower  The bell tower of the Garnisonkirche, a dominating structure, measured 88,4 meters and reached well into the street in front of it. Its side walls were interrupted by tall, narrow windows, while sculptures flanked the corners. A panel with gold lettering mounted above the main entrance facing Broad Street (Breiten Stra√üe) read, \\"Friderich Wilhelm, King of Prussia, had this tower built next to the Garnisonkirchein to the honor of God. Anno 1735\\". Some of the letters may still be seen today. The foundation of the bell tower was solidly built and tapered to the upper stories. The top story, built of oak, had lanterns and a copper-covered roof crowned with a weather vane. A carillon, inherited from the first Garrison church consecrated in 1722, was augmented with five new bass tone bells produced by Paul Meurer. Choral music was played on the hour, alternating with secular music played on the half-hour until the end of the 18th century. From 1797 until 1945 the musical order was changed to Bach's Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden (Praise the Lord, all ye nations) and √úb' immer Treu' und Redlichkeit (Always Be True and Faithful) from Ludwig H√∂lty, a theme Mozart composed for Papageno's aria, Ein M√§dchen oder Weibchen, in The Magic Flute. In between short melodies, some played upon request, rang out over the city every 7.5 minutes.  Nave  The nave was square built. Its cross axis was connected to the bell tower on the north side. A step hip roof, 17 meters high, had two dormer windows built into all but the south side of the roof. Tall round-arched windows dominated the fa√ßade which had decorative central portals on all three sides. Entrances on both sides of the tower led to a high balustrade from which it was possible to enter onto a roof walkway. Columned pillars flanked both sides of the main doors which, together with the tower itself, formed an imposing entrance from Broad Street.  Interior  The interior of the Garnison Church was clearly defined. Massive columns connected with solid basket arches supported a flat roof and a two-storeyed emporium. The interior, at first largely without ornamentation, had simple wood panelling, and, while the civilian congregation sat on benches in the nave, the soldiers sat above in the gallery. A wooden pulpit stood on the south side of the nave. In 1735, Frederick William I had the ground floor crypt built under a new and colorful baroque style high altar with pulpit designed by Christian Friedrich Feldmann (de) and constructed by Johann Christian Angermann and Johann Konrad Koch. The sculptor, Johann Georg Glume (de), created marble figures of Mars and Bellona, which flanked the entrance to the crypt below. Holy Communion was served from the original wooden pulpit, now called the Field Altar.  Wagner organ  The Garrison church organ, which included a carillon, was built by the organ builder Joachim Wagner (de) in 1731‚Äì32 and had 25 registers on 3 manuals with pedals. These were later increased to 42 registers by his colleague, Carl Ludwig Gesell (de), in 1862. The organ was further modernized by Wilhelm Sauer during extensive interior renovations carried out from 1897‚Äì99. He re-used approximately half of the original historical organ pipes for the new late-romantic style organ, increased the number of registers to 46 and changed the mechanics to a pneumatic action system. The organ was unusually placed and stood over the chancel on the second balcony. It had an imposing casing with richly carved ornamentation and sculptural details thought to be designed by the Johann Glume. The prospect, or organ pipes, were arranged in three towers, each with six groups of pipes, the longest of which was 5 meters. Some of the pedal registers were housed in the middle tower for lack of space. Remarkable but suitable for a military church, the organ had chimes imitating trombones and kettledrums mounted on angels. A circling sun and a wing-beating eagle completed the decor. Thanks to a generous donation from the mail order house founder, Werner Otto, it has been possible to rebuild the Wagner organ based on existing documents.  History  Johann Sebastian Bach played the organ of the Garrison Church in 1747 Napoleon visited the tomb of Frederick the Great in 1806  First building  From 1720 to 1722, the first Potsdam Garrison Church was a square half-timbered building built on the same spot as the later version we know of today. It had a steep pavilion roof and a two-storey tower which housed a 35 tone carillon built by the Amsterdam organ builder Jan Albert de Grave (nl). Soldiers, most of whom were members of the royal regiment 'Potsdam Giants', made up the congregation and regularly attended German Reformed Church services there.  Second building, Garrison Church  After only a few years, cracks appeared in the walls, and the building began to tilt due to the marshy land beneath and insufficient foundations. In 1730, the carillon had to be removed and the church and tower were torn down. Since King Frederick William I was interested in the well-being of his soldiers and wanted them instructed in church customs, he commissioned the architect Philipp Gerlach to plan a new church. Construction began in 1731, and on August 17, 1732, the church was consecrated by the court chaplain, Christian Johann Cochius, and the military chaplain, Johann Gottfried Hornejus. As with almost all the churches he commissioned in Potsdam and Berlin, the king wanted the Garrison Church to have a high, imposing and solidly built tower as proof of his firm belief in God. In 1730, and again in 1734, he had experienced the collapse of the nearly completed tower of the St. Peter's Church (de) in Berlin. So it was with great gratitude that he was able to climb the 365 steps to the top of the Garrison Church bell tower in August 1735, soon after recovering from severe illness.  Dedication until the Weimar Republic In 1735, Frederick William I ordered a crypt to be built under the main altar of the Garrison Church. Five years later he was buried there a day after his death on May 31, 1740. His successor, Frederick II, invited Johann Sebastian Bach to visit Potsdam. Bach played the organ at the Garrison Church and declared it to be a \\"very fine work\\". Sophia Dorothea, wife of Frederick William I, who died on June 28, 1757, decreed in her testament that she wished to be buried in the Hohenzollern Crypt of the Berlin Cathedral, so that her space in the Garrison Church remained free. Her son, Frederick II, also did not designate it as his burial place, preferring instead to be interred on the terrace in front of Sanssouci in Potsdam. Contrary to his wish, he was buried alongside his father on the day of his death, August 18, 1786. His funeral ceremony, however, took place later on September 9, 1786. At the request of Queen Louise in 1797, the choral Lobe den Herrn, meine Seele (Praise the Lord, my soul) was played on the carillon each hour, followed on the half-hour by √úb' immer Treu' und Redlichkeit (using the aria melody Ein M√§dchen oder Weibchen from Mozart's The Magic Flute). Previously the pieces were simply alternated as was the custom in Holland. In November 1805, the Russian Tsar Alexander I was invited by King Frederick William III and Queen Louise to meet in the royal crypt to celebrate the consolidation of their alliance against Napoleon. On October 25, 1806, after his victory over the Prussian Army at Jena‚ÄìAuerstedt, Napoleon marched to Berlin and Potsdam and requested to visit Frederick II's private apartment in the Berlin Palace and the royal crypt in the Garrison Church, respectively. His comment that he would probably not have been there had Frederick II still been alive most likely was not said at the crypt as is so often stated, but, out of respect for Frederick II, Napoleon placed the Garrison Church under his personal protection, while he appropriated both the French Church (de) and the Church of the Holy Spirit (de) to stable his cavalry. Another reason why the Garrison Church played such an important role in the history of Potsdam was because the first freely elected Potsdam Magistrate was inaugurated there on August 3, 1809. In 1816, in order to make room for flags at the victory celebration of the War of Liberation against the French Army, the figures of Mars and Bellona in the Garrison Church were moved to the staircase of the City Palace. The church balustrade railings were draped in red and gold fabric and hung with commemorative plaques for the soldiers who had fallen in battle. On October 31, 1817, the first ecumenical service of the Reformed Calvinist and Lutheran Churches was performed on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the Reformation. Frederick William IV, while still the crown prince, began making designs for the modernization of the Garrison Church. He suggested building a five-sided basilica ten times the size of the existing church, which was never realized. The only change made during his reign was the addition of a 10-sided christening chapel in the southwest vestibule (1886), followed by renovation work in the nave (also 1886), and repair work on the tower. Later a new ‚Äúwilhelminische‚Äù interior, designed and realized by Friedrich Laske. It was characterized by the representational style popular at the time and featured newly arranged cypress wood pews, and richly decorated paneling. The balustrade railings were embellished with molding and decorative elements (cartouches) embossed with gold. Friedrich Laske was also responsible for new architectural demands such as fire protection, heating, lighting, and improved of visibility from the balconies. The number of war trophies rose to 117 French flags, 25 Danish flags and 7 Austrian banners. Organ registers were increased from 42 to 46 while the organ pipes remained unchanged. In 1907, a wrought iron gate was added to the tower entrance, and in 1910 Kaiser Wilhelm II donated a splendid altar table, ending an era of considerable embellishment. According to Article 245 of the Versailles Treaty, the French trophies should have been returned to France, but in July 1919, they were removed by persons unknown and, to this day, have never been found. They were replaced by flags of the now defunct Prussian regiments. The role of the Garrison Church, long known for fostering church music, had been neglected and was reestablished in the 20th century largely by Professor Otto Becker, who served as organist and performed on the carillon and organ from 1910 until 1945. During this period over 2000 carillon and organ concerts, oratories, religious concerts and chamber music concerts were performed in the Garrison Church. Prof. Becker also served as organist in Potsdam's synagogue from 1915 until 1933. From 1925 until 1930 the architect Karl Daubitz undertook wide- ranging repair work documented by hundreds of drawings and photos which still exist.  Nazi era until destruction The Nazis hoped for a majority of votes in the parliamentary elections held under an extremely uncertain climate of judicial insecurity and violence on March 5, 1933. Their plan was to dissolve Parliament to pave the way for dictatorship. Already on the eve of the burning of the Reichstag the idea to celebrate the reopening of Parliament in the Garrison Church was born. On March 2 the plan was approved and six days later March 21 was decided as the celebration date. After protests from church authorities and the President of Parliament, it was agreed that only the opening ceremony would be held in the Garrison Church. The official opening meeting was to take place next door in the ‚ÄúLangen Stall‚Äù. For lack of time this plan too was reversed, and the Kroll Opera became the venue for the event. The intentionally-chosen date fell on the anniversary of the opening of the first Reichstag Parliament by Kaiser Wilhelm I in the White Salon in the Berlin Palace on March 21, 1871. This time Parliamentary President Paul von Hindenburg was seen by many as a substitute for the Kaiser, allowing Hitler's ‚ÄúMachtergreifung‚Äù to become a symbol of a Prussian conservative rebirth of the nation (‚ÄúWiedergeburt der Nation‚Äù). The deal was sealed by a handshake between the Chancellor, Hitler, and the President, von Hindenburg Paul von Hindenburg. A famous photograph of it by the American (N.Y. Times) photographer, Theo Eisenhard, became the media icon of the day. Yet the handshake represented no more and no less than Hitler's dismissal of Hindenburg.Quotes taken from the exhibition Catalogue published by Garrison Church Foundation/FWG: Page 6a. Two and five Reichsmark coins showing the church were minted in 1934‚Äì35. All of the two and some of the five carry the commemorative date, \\"21 M√§rz 1933\\". These coins remain available at modest prices. Germany - Third Reich 5 Reichsmark KM# 83 1934E Ruin in April 1945 National Socialist leadership led Germany into the World War II, which left Potsdam heavily damaged. For fear of bombardments, the coffins of Frederick II and his father, Frederick William I, were removed from the Garrison Church in 1943 and placed in a bunker in today's German Army Command Centre in Potsdam. After the British bombings on April 14 and 15, 1945, it looked as though the church had remained unscathed, but on the 15th the ‚ÄúLange Stall next door took a direct hit, and the ensuing fire storm entered the church through windows broken by the bombing the night before. The fire destroyed the wooden galleries and the roof before it entered the tower, where wooden ventilation shutters needed for the carillon mechanic allowed the fire to spread quickly. Damage to water pipes and low water pressure resulting from the bombings made it impossible for fire hoses to reach the source of the blaze. Firemen could only watch helplessly as first the tower burned from top to bottom followed by the wooden beams in the church nave. Only the crucifix, chandeliers and the altar table could be saved before the enormous heat caused an unexploded ordnance to detonate. One by one the carillon bells loosened and fell nearly 80 meters to the ground until finally the oaken roof of the tower also collapsed ending the long existence of Potsdam's most famous musical instrument. Only the ruined outside walls of the church and a stump of its tower remained.Excerpts from Pastor Gerhard Schroder's \\"Report on the Bombing and Burning of the Garrison Church on April 14, 1945: Brandenburg Cathedral Archives. The congregation, now much reduced in number, managed to maintain ownership of the land belonging to the Garrison Church Potsdam after negotiating with local government authorities. Aside from the church ruin, the parish hall and two further dwellings were in desolate condition and, with help from both Church and State institutions, every effort was made to repair them. On July 25, 1949, the parish council decided to rename the church Holy Crucifix Church in order to free it and its parishioners from the burden of Prussian militarism and mark the beginning of a new era dedicated to awareness of sin and Christ's suffering. Within the year the Holy Crucifix congregation moved into a chapel built within the ruins of the bell tower. Two newly-cast bells rang to announce services. The 1960s saw the beginning of reconstruction. Visitors could make appointments with the church custodian to climb 60 meters to the top of the tower. In 1966, construction work on 5 tower landings came to an abrupt end, when in August the leaders of the Potsdam Communist Party decided to have the ruins removed without consulting the general public.\\"Preparatory Work May regarding Garrison Chirch from 9.12.1966\\", Page 1f (BLHA Rep. 530 Communist-District Management Potsdam) A year later, Walter Ulbricht, President of the East German state and a staunch opponent to the church and all that had to do with the Prussian monarchy, visited Potsdam and, during a three-hour debate over the future of building policy, asked, ‚ÄúWhat right does this ruin have to exist in Potsdam?‚ÄùQuoted from Christina Emmerich-Focke: Stadtplanung in Potsdam 1945‚Äì1990. Berlin 1999, Page 160. Further, he declared that all ruins in Potsdam left from the war should disappear, for the establishment of a new church could only interfere with the creation of a socialist city image. Strong opposition from Church Authorities, those who wished to protect city monuments, architects and citizens both within and without East Germany were unable to prevent the decision by the city authorities on April 26, 1968 to destroy what was left of the Garrison Church. Curiously, the decision was not unanimous as was the norm in the GDR. Four delegates voted against it. On May 14, 1968, several blasts demolished the church ruins. On June 19, after an unsuccessful attempt to destroy it, half of the tower ruin remained standing. The rest finally was finally destroyed on Sunday, June 23. Once the rubble was removed, construction began for the nearby Potsdam Computing Centre in 1971.Zur Geschichte der Abrissbem√ºhungen siehe Hans Berg: Die verlorene Potsdamer Mitte, Eigenverlag Hans Berg, Berlin 1999, pp. 14‚Äì19.

Reconstruction  In 1984, the Society for the Continuation of the Potsdam Carillon Tradition (acronym SCPC) was founded in Iserlohn. In 1987 work began to cast new bells for the carillon which were turned over to the city of Potsdam on April 14, 1991, shortly after German reunification. At the request of the Mayor of Potsdam, donations given to the Society were designated for the reconstruction of the Garrison Church. In 2001 the President of the SCPC initiated the founding of the ‚ÄúStiftung Preu√üisches Kulturerbe‚Äù (Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation), which, once reconstruction was completed, would be responsible for future maintenance. He did not succeed, however, in reaching agreement with the Protestant Church (Evangelische Kirche) and the City of Potsdam over the subsequent use of the church and decided instead to dissolve the SCPC and pass its donations (over 6 million Euros) on to the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. The members of the dissolved society then became a ‚ÄúCircle of Friends‚Äù without right of say but willing to cooperate with the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. On January 15, 2004 over 100 individuals from Brandenburg and Berlin signed up for ‚ÄúCall from Potsdam‚Äù, a petition calling for the complete reconstruction of the Hof und Garnisonkirche Potsdam. Patrons for the initiative at the time were Bishop Dr. Wolfgang Huber, Prime Minister of Brandenburg Matthias Platzeck and Minister of Interior Brandenburg J√∂rg Sch√∂nbohm. Since 2004, the Garnisonkirche belongs to the International Community of the Cross of Nails (founded in Dresden in February 1991). In February 2004 on the initiative of the Industry Club of Potsdam, citizens from both Potsdam and Berlin founded the Society for the Reconstruction of the Garrison Church Potsdam (German acronym FWG) following the concept proposed by the Protestant Church of Germany. The FWG is an agreement between persons and organizations with interests stemming from religious, philosophical, cultural or city planning backgrounds who wish to recommend and commit their support to the present and future work involved in the reconstruction of the Garrison Church according to the theme stated in Call from Potsdam. At the end of a church service celebrated on June 23, 2008, Bishop Dr. Wolfgang Huber announced the creation of the Garrison Church Potsdam Foundation in the presence of many prominent personalities. The date was chosen on purpose: it was the 40th anniversary of the day the East German Communist government, without authorization and despite massive protest in and outside the country, blew up the remnants of the Garrison Church; remnants which could have been reconstructed. The purpose and aim of the new foundation is to rebuild the Garrison Church as a lesson of conscience. On June 25, 2011 a temporary chapel was opened to the public. It contains an exhibition marking the past and future history of the Garrison Church and stands just behind the spot where future church will one day be built. The leaders of the Protestant Church of Germany decided in 2010 that the chapel should be an official parish church with its own pastor . In 2013 the German National Committee for Cultural and Media Affairs named the Garrison church Potsdam an important cultural monument and offered 12 million Euro towards the funding of its reconstruction. Reconstruction work began in 2017 with the aim to complete the tower first. Since July 2013 the Garrison Church Foundation has official permission for the reconstruction of the church tower. By clearing the area and re-routing the course of Broad Street to accommodate as nearly as possible the original building site; two important premises for the start of construction have already been met. A ceremony for the beginning of construction on the tower of the reconstructed Garrison Church is due to be celebrated on October 31, 2017 (the 500th anniversary of the Reformation). ‚ÄúHe who closes his eyes to the Past will be blind to the Future ‚Ä¶ therefore we must understand that there can be no reconciliation without remembrance.‚Äù Richard von Weizs√§cker, at the ceremony of remembrance of the 40th anniversary marking the end of the Second World War in the German Bundestag on May 8, 1985.

It offers many recreational opportunities, irrigation, and is an important source of drinking water for Grand Junction. The Grand Mesa is one of the largest flat topped mountains in the world and has over 300 lakes and reservoirs on top, many of which are in the Kannah Creek watershed, which help retain much of Grand Junction's drinking water throughout the year as the snowpack melts and converts into runoff. Kannah Creek is also the namesake for the locally popular Kannah Creek Brewing Company. Kannah Creek is an extremely important source of water, originating on an elevated oasis, in an otherwise very arid region.  Recreation  The watershed offers many recreational options. There are four trails that utilize the valley, formed by the creek and its tributaries. The trails offer access to hiking, biking, camping, fishing, and pack riding. The Kannah Creek trail is 7.88 miles long from the base of the mesa to the upper rim, ending at Carson Lake. Canoeing and Kayaking are also possible in a few areas in the lower basin of the creek and is rated a class of III-V by American Whitewater. There is also plenty of wildlife in the area. In the pine and aspen forest on the higher altitude areas of the Grand Mesa, elk are plentiful, deer, foxes and coyotes, eagles and hawks, marmots, bighorn sheep, canada lynx, mountain goats songbirds. Fishing offers a bounty of brook, rainbow, and cutthroat trout. The newly reintroduced moose is also said to be thriving. The trails start in juniper and pinyon pine forest and moves up to pine and aspen forest as elevation is gained.  Human usage  Kannah Creek is derived from snowpack that accumulates all winter and spring and acts as a frozen reservoir where it slowly melts and runs off all year. The city of Grand Junction has cooperated with many governmental and private property owners to create small dams and reservoirs on top of the Grand Mesa to store water from snowmelt year round. The water from the reservoirs is partially let to manumit down the drainage, and then stored again at the base of the mesa in Juniata Reservoir and the other Purdy Mesa Reservoirs. From there the water is taken in and treated at the Kannah Creek Water Plant, in Whitewater, CO. Afterwards gravity is used to channel and divert water to storage points located around the Grand Junction Metropolitan Statistical Area. The creation of this system was initiated by local vote, and a large majority desire for a new, raw, and especially fresh and clean water source rather than the replaced source which acquired water out of the heavy-flowing, sediment filled, Gunnison River. The Creek also provides a source of irrigation for the many farms in the lower basin of the creek beneath the mesa. It is a popular fruit growing region.

In 2002, his garage band, control freak, signed a record deal with No Exit Records. Michael was ultimately dissatisfied by the one album they put out, which prompted him to focus his attention back on painting.

They were formed in 1993, and the original line-up consisted of Austin Morsely, Bob Glennie and Jamie Smart. Beginnings Smart was a resident DJ at the Essex nightclubs, Oscars in Clacton and TooToo's in Frating. He provided the vehicle for the band to release their music through their own record label, Wanted Records, and later went on to support The Prodigy. Morsely and Glennie met on the local rave scene. They had both been playing around with basic music equipment for a few years, and came together when Morsley purchased a Roland W-30 synthesiser which eventually spawned the track, \\"Narcotic Influence\\". The track was released and distributed by the band in November 1993 and, initially pressing 500 copies on vinyl, it went on to sell nearly 5,000 copies. Signed to XL Recordings They followed \\"Narcotic Influence\\" with two singles in 1994, \\"Quark\\" and the double A-side \\"Ciao\\" / \\"Advanced Technology\\". During the latter part of 1994 XL Recordings offered them a recording contract. XL chose to re-release \\"Narcotic Influence\\" in 1995 accompanied by a music video, and it went on to sell 15,000 copies and peaked at #64 in the UK Singles Chart. This was followed up with the release of the single \\"Jesus Christ\\" (1995) and the album Advanced Technology in 1996. During this time the band toured both the UK and Europe including the Phoenix Festival in 1994 and 1995, and Tribal Gathering in 1997 alongside Kraftwerk. They also toured with The Prodigy. They also remixed The Prodigy's \\"Firestarter\\". The band toured the US in 1997 as a part of the big top tour, alongside Moby, 808 State, System 7 and BT. The same year they issued \\"BETA\\" (UK #75) featuring remixes by Front 242 and Doc Scott, followed later in the year by \\"See Yourself\\" as a vinyl-only release. Tragedy then struck the group when Glennie was diagnosed with a brain tumour, and the band was eventually put on hiatus when it became impossible to complete the follow up to Advanced Technology. Empirion parted ways with XL Recordings in 1998, and Glennie died of cancer in 2005. Morsley went on to start his own project called KLOQ (band), and released several singles through the 2000s culminating in his debut album, Move Forward, in 2008. Kloq released their second studio album \\"Begin Again\\" on 8 October 2013 via Metropolis Records. Smart continued to DJ, and remixed for Leeroy Thornhill alongside Pete Crossman as Controlled Change, for the Flightcrank single \\"Amazing\\" in 2001, and the tracks \\"Machines\\" and \\"Depression\\" in 2010 on the Electric Tastebuds label. Re-formed In 2011, Smart and Morsley came back together under the Empirion name with a remix of the Victory Pill track, \\"Burnout\\". They have also embarked on several live dates throughout Europe, and are planning some new material. In April 2018, Empirion announced a new album, \\"Resume\\".

It has been developed to build upon the results of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis in order to estimate the seismic risk faced by a given structure. It can be considered to be the dynamic equivalent of the static pushover analysis. Description IDA involves performing multiple nonlinear dynamic analyses of a structural model under a suite of ground motion records, each scaled to several levels of seismic intensity. The scaling levels are appropriately selected to force the structure through the entire range of behavior, from elastic to inelastic and finally to global dynamic instability, where the structure essentially experiences collapse. Appropriate postprocessing can present the results in terms of IDA curves, one for each ground motion record, of the seismic intensity, typically represented by a scalar Intensity Measure (IM), versus the structural response, as measured by an engineering demand parameter (EDP). Possible choices for the IM are scalar (or rarely vector) quantities that relate to the severity of the recorded ground motion and scale linearly or nonlinearly with its amplitude. The IM is properly chosen well so that appropriate hazard maps (hazard curves) can be produced for them by probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. In addition, the IM should be correlated with the structural response of interest to decrease the number of required response history analyses. Possible choices are the peak ground acceleration, peak ground velocity or Arias intensity, but the most widely used is the 5%-damped spectral acceleration at the first-mode period of the structure. The results of the recent studies show that spectrum intensity (SI) is an appropriate IM. The EDP can be any structural response quantity that relates to structural, non-structural or contents' damage. Typical choices are the maximum (over all stories and time) interstory drift, the individual peak story drifts and the peak floor accelerations. Development history IDA grew out of the typical practice of scaling accelerograms by multiplying with a constant factor to represent more or less severe ground motions than the ones that were recorded at a site. Since the natural recordings available are never enough to cover all possible needs, scaling is a simple, yet potentially problematic method (if misused) to \\"fill-in\\" gaps in the current catalog of events. Still, in most cases, researchers would scale only a small set of three to seven records and typically only once, just to get an estimate of response in the area of interest. In the wake of the damage wrought by the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the SAC/FEMA project was launched to resolve the issue of poor performance of steel moment-resisting frames due to the fracturing beam-column connections. Within the creative environment of research cooperation, the idea of subjecting a structure to a wider range of scaling emerged. Initially, the method was called Dynamic Pushover and it was conceived as a way to estimate a proxy for the global collapse of the structure. It was later recognized that such a method would also enable checking for multiple limit-states, e.g. for life-safety, as is the standard for most seismic design methods, but also for lower and higher levels of intensity that represent different threat levels, such as immediate-occupancy and collapse-prevention. Thus, the idea for Incremental Dynamic Analysis was born, which was mainly adopted and later popularized by researchers at the John A. Blume Earthquake Research Center of Stanford University. This has now met with wider recognition in the earthquake research community and has spawned several different methods and concepts for estimating structural performance. A substantial debate has been raised regarding the potential bias in the IDA results due to using the scaled ground motions records that do not appropriately characterize the seismic hazard of the considered site over different earthquake intensity levels.Lin, T. and Baker, J.

The community is rooted in both the Catholic penitential movement and the pattern of Gospel life known as the Rule of the Third Order of St. Francis. Introduction Early in his ministry, Saint Francis of Assisi offered guidelines that became the foundation of what became the third form of Gospel life. Franciscan lay penitents soon began living in community, professing vows, and doing works of charity. This movement soon developed into religious congregations of the Third Order Regular, including the Franciscan Sisters of Peace. History of the Franciscan Sisters of Peace In 1865, three Franciscan Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart journeyed from Gemona del Friuli, Italy to New York City to minister and provide for the needs of Italian immigrants in the city. These women had a dedicated pioneering spirit that attracted vocations and gave impetus to diverse ministries, and also brought peace to others through their works of mercy and justice. In 1890, the sisters founded the American Province of St. Francis, within their European congregation. The Provincial motherhouse was established in Peekskill, New York. In 1986, one hundred and twelve vowed women of the St. Francis province co-founded a new Institute of Consecrated Life of Diocesan Right known as the Franciscan Sisters of Peace, based in Haverstraw, New York. The new congregation embodied a new expression of the charism of Saint Francis: peace. As mentioned by the congregation, peace is the fruit of a life based on four fundamental values: contemplative prayer, conversion, poverty, and minority (humility). The Franciscan Sisters of Peace are rooted in the pioneering spirit, faith and trust in Divine Providence characteristic of the early sisters.\\"History of the Franciscan Sisters of Peace,\\" http://fspnet.org/heritage.htm, accessed April 25, 2011. The mission of the Franciscan Sisters of Peace is to proclaim and live the Gospel of Jesus Christ in the footsteps of Saints Francis and Clare of Assisi. Today, they continue to spread their mission of peacemaking in a variety of ways as teachers, social workers, administrators, parish associates, prison chaplains, retreat directors, day care workers and health care workers.\\"A History of the Five Orders: Franciscan Sisters of Peace,\\" http://www.marianwoods.org/history.htm#peace, accessed April 25, 2011. The Franciscan Sisters of Peace are also one of five religious communities (along with the Sisters of Mercy, the Society of the Holy Child Jesus, the Sisters of Saint Dominic of Blauvelt and the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament) responsible for the creation in 1995 of Marian Woods, a healthcare facility for residents that range in age from 65 years to 100 years of age. Each resident is a member of the founding congregations and has a debilitating condition that has impaired their ability to perform every day tasks. Marian Woods was built on eleven acres of peaceful property in Hartsdale, New York, with 120 acres that surround the property preserved as a town park.\\"The Creation of Marian Woods,\\" http://www.marianwoods.org/about.htm#index, accessed April 25, 2011. Philosophy of the Congregation According to the Mission Statement of the Franciscan Sisters of Peace, the community states the following philosophy as guiding their mission in the world: * We believe in a God of Wisdom, Beauty, and Goodness, who is Creator of all things. * We believe that all creation is in relationship in and through Jesus Christ. * We believe that a simple, non-violent life originates in Jesus Christ and continues in the tradition of Clare and Francis of Assisi. * We believe that the sacredness of each human person and of the earth leads logically to non- violent, mutually affirming relationships. * We believe that the Third Millennium must be dedicated to simple, non-violent living. * We believe that women, children, the economically poor, sand the earth suffer from the absence of a simple, non-violent way of life. * We believe that non-violence is a Franciscan way of seizing the moral initiative, breaking the cycle of humiliation, exposing injustices of systems and cultures, and claiming the power of truth. * We believe that simple, non-violent living requires creativity, humor, moral imagination, trust, gentleness, frugality, and a willingness to suffer rather than retaliate. * We believe that the desire for peace as a way of life connects persons of different religious traditions and cultures toward a profound and powerful realization of the Reign of God for the Third Millennium. * As Franciscan Sisters of Peace, we believe that we can stir and encourage the imagination and create the concrete responses to violence needed in our lives today.\\"Philosophy of the Franciscan Sisters of Peace,\\" http://fspnet.org/pinstitu.htm#philosophy, accessed April 25, 2011. Mission of the Congregation This is the Mission Statement of the Franciscan Sisters of Peace, as quoted from their website: * We commit to educating toward a lifestyle characterized by the Christian and Franciscan perspective of simplicity and non-violence in a global community. * Peacemaking is the charism of our Community. As our ongoing mission in this regard, we: ** continue the peacemaking features of the ministries of the Sisters and Associates in the Newsletter of the Franciscan Sisters of Peace; ** establish a regular column in the Newsletter for educating about simplicity and non-violence; ** develop knowledge of and access to resources and reference materials that can be used for programs in the home, community, and classroom. ** recite daily the Pax Christi Peace Prayer and encourage others to do so. * Along with our life of prayer and our commitment to social justice, we look to the arts as a means of stimulating imagination, humor, sensitivity, and a moral voice about peacemaking. We: ** endorse art forms of music, video, dance, etc. to share stories of peace; ** teach and encourage others in similar projects; ** work towards the creation of violence-free areas and violence-free responses in our everyday lives; ** network with other persons and organizations to promote peace. * In the tradition and spirit of Saint Francis, we pray for peace and strive to develop it in our own hearts and lives as well as to bring it to the lives of those with whom we minister.\\"Mission of the Franciscan Sisters of Peace,\\" http://fspnet.org/pinstitu.htm#mission, accessed April 25, 2011.

Career Thompson had a small acting role in the 1917 Douglas Fairbanks Sr. film Reaching for the Moon, but his first writing work was a screenplay for Fairbanks. His last was scripting the Jack Benny musical Artists and Models. Some of his early silent film work was for the Christie Film Company, but his later screenwriting was associated primarily with Paramount Pictures where he became a general story advisor. At Paramount he was known for his work with Adolphe Menjou, and had written scripts and special materials for such stars as Raymond Griffith, Gary Cooper and Clara Bow, such as Clarence G. Badger's Paths to Paradise, Victor Fleming's The Virginian, and Frank Tuttle's True to the Navy. Fighting Caravans (1931), a story of the caravans of wagon trains that supplied freight to the pre-Civil War Old West before the completion of the transcontinental railways, was his adaption of a Zane Grey novel of the same name. His work Man Against Woman for Irving Cummings was called a \\"forceful drama\\" and an \\"entertaining film\\". During the later part of his career Thompson specialized in comedies. The more notable of these included Leo McCarey's Six of a Kind (1934) which used the top Paramount actors of the time, including Charlie Ruggles, Mary Boland, George Burns, W.C. Fields, Gracie Allen, Alison Skipworth. The 1945 Frank R. Strayer comedy film Mama Loves Papa was based upon his screenplay for the 1933 Norman Z. McLeod film of the same name. Keene became ill in June 1937, just after completing the script for the Jack Benny musical comedy Artists and Models. On July 11, 1937, he died of lobar pneumonia. His body is interred in the Great Mausoleum, Columbarium of the Graces at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in Glendale, CA.

For two weeks from 25 December 2013 Akademik Shokalskiy was trapped in thick ice in Commonwealth Bay, Antarctica, while operating an expedition for the Australasian Antarctic Expedition 2013-2014. The scientists and passengers were evacuated on 2 January.  Use as cruise ship  The ship has two passenger decks, with dining rooms, a bar, a library, and a sauna, and accommodates 54 passengers. She is owned by the Russian Federation's Far Eastern Hydrometeorological Research Institute, Vladivostok and was previously chartered to Aurora Expeditions, an Australian expedition cruise line. It is currently operated by Chimu Adventures an Australian Tour operator departing from Hobart to East Antarctica. In 2011, Akademik Shokalskiy sailed cruises along the coast of Russia, including the Northeast Passage, and to East Antarctica. Icebound in Antarctica In 2013 Akademik Shokalskiy was chartered by the Australasian Antarctic Expedition 2013-2014 to celebrate the centenary of the previous expedition under Douglas Mawson, and to repeat his scientific observations. The expedition had nine scientific goals related to observations, mapping, and measurements of environmental, biological, and marine changes associated with climate change. On 8 December 2013 the ship, with 74 people on board ‚Äî four journalists, 19 scientists, 26 tourists, the expedition leader's wife and two children, and 22 crew members ‚Äî sailed from Bluff in New Zealand to Antarctica. Around 07:20 AEDT on 25 December 2013, the ship broadcast a distress message after becoming trapped in heavy ice a few miles from the coast of Antarctica, east of the French base Dumont D'Urville and approximately south of Hobart. Chinese icebreaking research vessel Xuƒõ L√≥ng, French research vessel L'Astrolabe and Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis were dispatched by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to assist with the rescue operation of Akademik Shokalskiy. Xuƒõ L√≥ng, which arrived first, was prevented by thick sea ice from coming closer than about from Akademik Shokalskiy. However it remained in open water nearby as it carried a helicopter, which ultimately was deployed later for the rescue operation. L'Astrolabe also turned back after encountering heavy ice. Aurora Australis, arriving two days later, abandoned its attempt about from the stranded ship, as the ice was too thick to be broken and because of the risk of also becoming trapped in the ice. On 2 January 2014, Akademik Shokalskiys 52 passengers were evacuated to Aurora Australis by Xuƒõ L√≥ngs helicopter, which transferred them between temporary ice helipads alongside each vessel. The original plan was to helicopter the passengers to Xuƒõ L√≥ng, then transfer them to Aurora Australis by boat, but the Chinese icebreaker had become trapped by ice. After the rescue, Aurora Australis continued on her original mission to resupply Casey Station, before returning to Hobart on 22 January. The 22 Akademik Shokalskiy crew were required by their employment contracts to stay aboard until the ship could be freed. On 4 January 2014, the American heavy icebreaker Polar Star was dispatched from Sydney, Australia to assist Akademik Shokalskiy and Xuƒõ L√≥ng at the request of Australian authorities. However, on 8 January the Australian Maritime Safety Authority confirmed that both vessels had broken free and were proceeding to open water, and later the same day Polar Star was released to scheduled duties. On 14 January Akademik Shokalskiy returned to the port of Bluff. Environmental writer Andrew Revkin criticized the scientists on board Akademik Shokalskiy, stating that \\"important and costly field research in Antarctica has been seriously disrupted\\" by an \\"unessential\\" mission. He also commended an article by Professor Michael Robinson of University of Hartford, which noted that the expedition aimed to use Mawson's observations as a baseline for their own scientific findings \\"that will illuminate Antarctica's future, not its past. As such, the voyage will prove to be well worth the time and effort.\\" References=Notes=External links *Aurora Expeditions: Akademik Shokalskiy *Shipspotting: IMO 8010336 Category:Ships built in Turku Category:Expedition cruising Category:Akademik Shuleykin-class oceanographic research vessels Category:1982 ships ","title":"Akademik Shokalskiy"},{"id":"31594596","text":"Los Angeles Angels in 2011 Alexi Jose Amarista (born April 6, 1989) is a Venezuelan professional baseball utility player for the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, San Diego Padres, and Colorado Rockies. Professional career=Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Amarista was signed by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim as an amateur free agent in 2007. He played in the Dominican Summer League in 2007 before playing with the Angels' rookie league and Class-A clubs in 2008. Amarista transitioned all the way from high-A to the Triple-A level in 2010. After starting 2011 with the Triple-A Salt Lake Bees, Amarista was called up to the majors for the first time on April 25, 2011. He made his first appearance on April 26, 2011 against the Oakland Athletics. In his first major league at bat, he doubled to drive in two runs. Amarista played in a total of 23 games with the Angels in 2011. Amarista opened 2012 as a utility infielder on the Angels 25-man roster but only played in a single game as a pinch runner before being optioned to AAA Salt Lake on April 13. San Diego Padres San Diego Padres in 2012 On May 3, 2012, Amarista and minor league pitcher Donn Roach were traded to the San Diego Padres for reliever Ernesto Frieri. After 11 games with the Triple-A Tucson Padres, Amarista was called up to the Padres on May 17 to play second base. Amarista was eventually supplanted by Logan Forsythe as the regular second baseman, but he continued to show his versatility by making occasional starts at second, shortstop, left field, and also in center field when Cameron Maybin was nursing a wrist injury. On June 28, 2012, Amarista hit his first career home-run, a grand slam off of Brett Myers, to cap off a six-run ninth inning in a victory against the Houston Astros.Alexi Amarista's slam caps six-run 9th as Padres rally to beat Astros.

He began the year making spot starts in center and around the infield and serving as a pinch hitter. On April 6, Amarista's birthday, he hit a 3-run pinch hit home run to defeat the Miami Marlins. Amarista picked up a handful of starts at third and second when Chase Headley was out with a strained calf in late April and early May. He saw more time at second and third in June when Jedd Gyorko was out with plantar fasciitis and Chase Headley sat with a herniated disc. When Everth Cabrera sat out with a hamstring injury on July 1, later spending significant time on the disabled list, Amarista began seeing regular time at shortstop. Amarista made 68 starts at the position from July 1 through the end of the year. He finished the season with a .239/.286/.314 batting line and five home runs, setting career highs in at-bats (423), games started (119), and games played (148). Amarista began 2015 as the Padres everyday shortstop, splitting time with Clint Barmes. He also made a handful of starts at second base and left field later in the year. On June 17th, Amarista pitched to one batter in the 8th inning of a blowout against the Oakland Athletics, retiring the only batter he faced on a flyout to right-field. For the year, he made 79 starts at short and played in 118 games overall, batting .204/.257/.287 with three home runs. Amarista started the 2016 season with Triple-A El Paso, but was called up within the first week of the season when Yangervis Solarte went to the disabled list. Amarista himself landed on the 15-day disabled list with a right hamstring strain on April 20. On May 31st, Amarista was once again brought in to pitch with 2 outs in the 8th inning of a blowout, this time against the Seattle Mariners, and retired the only batter he faced on a ground-out to second base. Amarista continued in a part-time role during June and was optioned to Triple-A on July 3. He bounced between Triple-A and the Majors in July, and then went to the disabled list after re-injuring his hamstring on August 1. Amarista returned in September in a utility role, playing the infield and outfield. He finished the season with a .257/.295/.271 batting line in 140 at-bats. He had 31 starts in the field, including at second base, shortstop, third, and left and right field.

Ullman, 318 U.S. 44 (1943), was a United States Supreme Court case..  Procedural History  The Supreme Court of Errors Connecticut held that ¬ß¬ß 6246 and 6562 of the Connecticut General Statutes of 1930 which prohibited the use of drugs or instruments to prevent conception and the giving of assistance or counsel in their use were constitutional. The Supreme Court of the United States assumed without first determining if the case was an appropriate one for a declaratory judgment, ruled that the statutes \\"prohibit the action proposed to be done\\" by appellant and \\"are constitutional.\\"  Facts  Appellee claims that appellant, a physician, committed such an offense for giving professional advice concerning the use of contraceptives to three patients whose condition of health was such that their lives would be endangered by child-bearing. The appellant contended that because of the nature of his patients' exceptional condition in light of the danger child-bearing could pose for them that this was a just reason for the advice to be authorized and necessary. However, his complaint contained no allegations asserting any claim under the Fourteenth Amendment of infringement of appellant's liberty or his property rights. The relief prayed was a declaratory judgment as to whether the statutes are applicable to appellant and, if so, whether they constitute a valid exercise of constitutional power \\"within the meaning and intent of Amendment XIV of the Constitution of the United States prohibiting a state from depriving any person of life without due process of law.\\"  Significance  The sole constitutional attack upon the statutes in question are under the Fourteenth Amendment and confined the physician's contention for depravity of life‚Äînot appellant's but his patients'. Thus, the life of the appellant himself is not in danger. No genuine case or controversy essential to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Court for this subject-matter existed until Griswold v. Connecticut.  Holding  The Supreme Court held that the proceedings in the state courts presented no constitutional question which appellant has standing to assert. No question is raised as to the applicability and constitutionality of the statutes in their application to the physician in respect to deprivation of liberty or property in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, the court does not speak to whether it has jurisdiction to enforce a law that prevents the use of contraceptives for the state of Connecticut.

The Nationalist faction () or Rebel faction () was a major faction in the Spanish Civil War of 1936 to 1939. It was composed of a variety of right-leaning political groups that supported the Spanish Coup of July 1936 against the Second Spanish Republic and Republican faction and sought to depose Manuel Aza√±a, including the Falange, the CEDA, and two rival monarchist claimants: the Alfonsist Renovaci√≥n Espa√±ola and the Carlist Traditionalist Communion. In 1937, all the groups were merged into the FET y de las JONS. One of the members of the 1936 coup, General Francisco Franco, would after the death of the faction's earlier leaders head the Nationalists throughout most of the war and emerge as the dictator of Spain until 1975. The term Nationalists or Nationals () was coined by Joseph Goebbels following the visit of the clandestine Spanish delegation led by Captain Francisco Arranz requesting war material on 24 July 1936, in order to give a cloak of legitimacy to Nazi Germany's help to the Spanish rebel military.Juan Eslava Gal√°n, Una Historia de la Guerra Civil que no va a Gustar a Nadie, Ed. Planeta. 2005. . pp. 9-12. The leaders of the rebel faction, who had already been denominated as 'Crusaders' by Bishop of Salamanca Enrique Pla y Deniel ‚Äîand also used the term Cruzada for their campaign‚Äî immediately took a liking to it. The term Bando nacional ‚Äîmuch as the term rojos (Reds) to refer to the loyalists‚Äî is considered by some authors as a term linked with the propaganda of that faction. Throughout the civil war the term 'Nationalist' was mainly used by the members and supporters of the rebel faction, while its opponents used the terms fascistas (fascists) or facciosos (sectarians)√Ångel Bahamonde & Javier Cervera Gil, As√≠ termin√≥ la Guerra de Espa√±a, Marcial Pons, Madrid 1999, to refer to this faction. Belligerents The military rebellion found wide areas of support both inside Spain and in the international sphere. In Spain the Francoist side was mainly supported by the predominantly conservative upper class, liberal professionals, religious organizations and land-owning farmers. It was mostly based in the rural areas where progressive political movements had made few inroads, such as great swathes of the Northern Meseta, including almost all of Old Castile, as well as La Rioja, Navarra, Alava, the area near Zaragoza in Aragon, most of Galicia, parts of C√°ceres in Extremadura and many dispersed pockets in rural Andaluc√≠a where the local society still followed ancient traditional patterns and was yet untouched by \\"modern\\" thought.Navarro Garc√≠a, Clotilde. La educaci√≥n y el nacional-catolicismo. Univ de Castilla La Mancha, 1993. , pp. 36-37 Political groups Politically this faction rallied together various parties and organizations which in some cases espoused opposed ideologies, such as the conservative CEDA and Alejandro Lerroux's radicals (liberals), as well as Falangists, Catholics and pro- Monarchic movements such as the Agraristas and the Carlistas (Requet√©s). =Falange= Falange The Falange Espa√±ola was originally a Spanish fascist political party founded by Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera, son of the former Spanish leader Miguel Primo de Rivera.Michael Alpert. A New International History of the Spanish Civil War. Paperback edition. Hampshire and London, England, UK: Macmillan Press Ltd, 1997; New York, New York, USA: St. Martin's Press Ltd, 1997. Pp. 36. The Falange was created with the financial assistance of Alfonsist monarchist funding.Paul Preston. The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution & Revenge. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York, USA: Norton & Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 Pp. 70. Upon being formed, the Falange was officially anti-clerical and anti-monarchist.Patrick Turnbull. The Spanish Civil War, 1936‚Äì39. 6th edition. Oxford, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Osprey Publishing, 2005. Pp. 8. As a landowner and aristocrat, Primo de Rivera assured the upper classes that Spanish fascism would not get out of their control like its equivalents in Germany and Italy. In 1934, the Falange merged with the pro-Nazi Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista of Ramiro Ledesma Ramos, to form the Falange Espa√±ola de las JONS. Initially, the Falange was short of funds and was a small student-based movement that preached of a utopian violent nationalist revolution. The Falange committed acts of violence prior to the war, including becoming involved in street brawls with their political opponents that helped to create a state of lawlessness that the right-wing press blamed on the republic to support a military uprising. Falangist terror squads sought to create an atmosphere of disorder in order to justify the imposition of an authoritarian regime.Paul Preston. The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution & Revenge. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York, USA: Norton & Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 Pp. 89. With the onset of middle- class disillusionment with the CEDA's legalism, support for the Falange expanded rapidly. By September 1936, the total Falangist volunteers numbered at 35,000, accounting for 55 percent of all civilian forces of the Nationals.Stanley G. Payne. Fascism in Spain, 1923‚Äì1977. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: Wisconsin University Press, 1999. Pp. 242. Falange Espa√±ola de las JONS was one of the original supporters of the military coup d'√©tat against the republic, the other being the Carlists.Paul Preston. The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution & Revenge. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York, USA: Norton & Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 Pp. 94. After the death of Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera, Manuel Hedilla sought to take control of the Falange, but this was usurped by Franco who sought to take control of the movement as part of his move to take control of the National faction.Stanley G. Payne. Fascism in Spain, 1923‚Äì1977. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: Wisconsin University Press, 1999. Pp. 268. In 1937, Franco announced a decree of unification of the National political movements, particularly the Falange and the Carlists into a single movement, nominally still the Falange, under his leadership,Paul Preston. The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution & Revenge. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York, USA: Norton & Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 Pp. 214. under the name Falange Espa√±ola Tradicionalista y de las JONS. Both Falangists and Carlists were initially furious at the decision, Falangists in particular saw their ideological role as being usurped by the Catholic Church and their \\"revolution\\" being indefinitely postponed. Upon unification and seizure of leadership by Franco, Franco distanced the party from fascism and declared \\"The Falange does not consider itself fascist; its founder said so personally.\\"Stanley G. Payne. Fascism in Spain, 1923‚Äì1977. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: Wisconsin University Press, 1999. Pp. 272. After this announcement, the practice in the National faction of referring to the Falange as \\"fascists\\" disappeared by 1937, but Franco did not deny that there were fascists within the Falange. Franco declared that the Falange's goal was to incorporate the \\"great neutral mass of the unaffiliated,\\" and promised that no ideological rigidity would be allowed to interfere with the goal. Under Franco's leadership, the Falange abandoned the previous anticlerical tendencies of Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera and instead promoted neotraditionalist National Catholicism, though it continued to criticize Catholic pacifism.Stanley G. Payne. Fascism in Spain, 1923‚Äì1977. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: Wisconsin University Press, 1999. Pp. 280‚Äì281. Franco's Falange also abandoned hostility to capitalism, with Falange member Raimundo Fern√°ndez-Cuesta declaring that Falange's national syndicalism was fully compatible with capitalism.Stanley G. Payne. Fascism in Spain, 1923‚Äì1977. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: Wisconsin University Press, 1999. Pp. 281. =CEDA= CEDA The Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Right-wing Groups, CEDA, was a Catholic right-wing political organization dedicated to anti-Marxism.Paul Preston. The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution & Revenge. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York, USA: Norton & Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 Pp. 62. The CEDA was led by Jos√© Mar√≠a Gil- Robles y Qui√±ones. The CEDA claimed that it was defending Spain and \\"Christian civilization\\" from Marxism, and claimed that the political atmosphere in Spain had made politics a matter of Marxism versus anti-Marxism. With the advent of the rise of the Nazi Party to power in Germany, the CEDA aligned itself with similar propaganda ploys to the Nazis, including the Nazi emphasis on authority, the fatherland, and hierarchy. Gil-Robles attended in audience at the Nazi Party rally in Nuremberg and was influenced by it, henceforth becoming committed to creating a single anti-Marxist counterrevolutionary front in Spain. Gil-Robles declared his intention to \\"give Spain a true unity, a new spirit, a totalitarian polity...\\" and went on to say \\"Democracy is not an end but a means to the conquest of the new state. When the time comes, either parliament submits or we will eliminate it.\\"Paul Preston. The Spanish Civil War: reaction, revolution and revenge. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York, USA: Norton & Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 Pp. 64. The CEDA held fascist- style rallies, called Gil-Robles \\"Jefe\\", the equivalent of Duce, and claimed that the CEDA might lead a \\"March on Madrid\\" to forcefully seize power.Paul Preston.

The CEDA failed to make the substantive electoral gains from 1931 to 1936 that were needed for it to form government which resulted in right-wing support draining from it and turning towards the belligerent Alfonsist monarchist leader Jos√© Calvo Sotelo.Paul Preston. The Spanish Civil War: reaction, revolution and revenge. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York, USA: Norton & Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 Pp. 88‚Äì89. Subsequently, the CEDA abandoned its moderation and legalism and began providing support for those committed to violence against the republic, including handing over its electoral funds to the initial leader of the military coup against the republic, General Emilio Mola. Subsequently, supporters of the CEDA's youth movement, Juventudes de Acci√≥n Popular (JAP) began to defect en masse to join the Falange, and the JAP ceased to exist as a political organisation in 1937. =MonarchistsCarlists Carlists The Carlists were monarchists and ardent ultratraditionalist Catholics who sought the installation of Carlist Pretender Francisco Javier de Borb√≥n as King of Spain.Patrick Turnbull. The Spanish Civil War, 1936‚Äì39. 6th edition. Oxford, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Osprey Publishing, 2005. Pp. 10. The Carlists were anti-republican, anti- democratic and staunchly anti-socialist.Patrick Turnbull. The Spanish Civil War, 1936‚Äì39. 6th edition. Oxford, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Osprey Publishing, 2005. Pp. 8‚Äì9. The Carlists were so anti-socialist that they opposed both Hitler and Mussolini because of their supposed socialistic tendencies. The Carlists were led by Manuel Fal Cond√© and held their main base of support in Navarre. The Carlists along with the Falange were the original supporters of the military coup d'√©tat against the republic. The Carlists held a long history of violent opposition to the Spanish state, stemming back to 1833 when they launched a six-year civil war against the state.Patrick Turnbull. The Spanish Civil War, 1936‚Äì39. 6th edition. Oxford, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Osprey Publishing, 2005. Pp. 9. The Carlists were strongly intransigent to any coalition with other movements, even believing that no non-Carlist could have honest intentions. During the war, the Carlists' militia, the Requet√©s reached a peak of 42,000 recruits but by the end of hostilities in April 1939 their overall strength had been reduced to 23,000. The Carlists contributed some of the Nationalists' most effective shock troops during the war.  Alfonsists  Bank note issued by the Nationalist government in October 1937 with the coat of arms of Alfonso XIII The Alfonsists were a movement that supported the restoration of Alfonso XIII of Spain as monarch following the founding of the Spanish Second Republic in 1931. They competed with rival monarchists, the Carlists, for the Spanish throne. After the overthrow of the monarchy of Alfonso XIII, Alfonsist supporters formed the Renovaci√≥n Espa√±ola, a monarchist political party, which held considerable economic influence and had close supporters in the Spanish army.Andrew Forrest. The Spanish Civil War. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2000. Pp. 10. Renovaci√≥n Espa√±ola did not, however, manage to become a mass political movement. In 1934, the Alfonsists, led by Antonio Goicoechea, along with the Carlists, met with Italian dictator Benito Mussolini to gain support for an uprising against the republic, in which Mussolini promised to provide money and arms for such a rising.Paul Preston. The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution & Revenge. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York, USA: Norton & Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 Pp. 69. From 1934 to 1936, the charismatic Alfonsist leader Jos√© Calvo Sotelo spoke of the need for the \\"conquest of the state\\" as the only means to secure the establishment of an ideal authoritarian, corporatist state. Sotelo made passionate speeches in support of violent counterrevolution and emphasized the need for a military insurrection against the republic to counter the threats of communism and separatism that he blamed as being caused by the republic.Paul Preston. The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution & Reveng. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York, USA: Norton & Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 Pp. 92‚Äì93. Sotelo was kidnapped and assassinated by political opponents (who were initially searching out Gil-Robles of the CEDA to kidnap) on 13 July 1936 which sparked fury on the political right and helped legitimize the military coup against the republic.Paul Preston. The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution & Revenge. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York, USA: Norton & Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 Pp. 99. When the war broke out, Infante Juan, the son of Alfonso XIII and heir to the Spanish throne, requested the permission of Franco to take part in the Nationals' war effort by enlisting as a member of the crew of the cruiser Balaeres, which was nearing completion.Paul Preston. The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution & Revenge. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York, USA: Norton & Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 Pp. 209. He promised to abstain from political activities, but Franco refused, believing that he would become a figurehead for the Alfonsists who held a strong presence in the military.  Military Army of Africa= The Army of Africa was a field army garrisoned in Spanish Morocco - a legacy of the Rif War - under the command of General Francisco Franco. It consisted of the Spanish Foreign Legion and the Regulares, infantry and cavalry units recruited from the population of Spanish Morocco and with Spanish officers as commanders. The Regulares operated as the shock troops of the National forces in exchange for a substantial pay. More than 13,000 Moroccan troops were airlifted on 20 Junkers Ju 52 planes supplied by Hitler between the beginning of the conflict in July and October 1936. Their proverbial cruelty and reckless behaviour were not random, but were part of a calculated plan of the Francoist military leaders in order to instill terror in the Republican defence lines.Juli√°n Casanova, Rep√∫blica y Guerra Civil. in Historia de Espa√±a, directed by Josep Fontana y Ram√≥n Villares. Vol. 8, Barcelona: 2007, Cr√≠tica/Marcial Pons Publishers. , p. 278 The Army of Africa would be the most decorated unit in the May 1939 victory brigade by the Nationalists; it has been estimated that one in five of its members were killed during the war, a casualty rate twice as high as that of the Spanish. For several years after the war, Franco would have a squadron of Moorish troops act as his escort at public ceremonies as a reminder of the Army's importance in the Nationalist victory.Bolorinos Allard, Elisabeth. \\"The Crescent and the Dagger: Representations of the Moorish Other during the Spanish Civil War.\\" Bulletin of Spanish Studies 93, no. 6 (2016): 965-988. =Civil GuardForeign support=Italy Fascist Italy Italy under the Fascist leadership of Benito Mussolini supported the overthrow of the republic and the establishment of a regime that would serve as a client state to Italy.

Mussolini provided financial support as well as training to the Alfonsists, Carlists, and Falange. Mussolini met Falangist leader Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera in 1933 but did not have much enthusiasm in the establishment of fascism in Spain at that time. By January 1937, an expeditionary force of 35,000 Italians, the Corpo Truppe Volontarie, were in Spain under the command of General Mario Roatta. The contingent was made up of four divisions: Littorio, Dio lo Vuole (\\"God Wills it\\"), Fiamme Nere (\\"Black Flames\\") and Penne Nere (\\"Black Feathers\\"). The first of these divisions was made up of soldiers; the other three of Blackshirt volunteers. Italy provided the National forces with fighter and bomber aircraft which played a significant part in the war. In March 1937, Italy intervened in the political affairs of the Nationals by sending Roberto Farinacci to Spain to urge Franco to unite the National political movements into one fascist \\"Spanish National Party\\".Paul Preston.

Germany Nazi Germany Nazi Germany provided the Nationals with material, specialists, and a powerful air force contingent, the Condor Legion German expeditionary forces that provided airlift of soldiers and material from Spanish Africa to Peninsular Spain and provided offensive operations against Republican forces. The Spanish Civil War would provide an ideal testing ground for the proficiency of the new weapons produced during the German re-armament. Many aeronautical bombing techniques were tested by the Condor Legion against the Republican Government on Spanish soil with the permission of General√≠simo Franco. Hitler insisted, however, that his long- term designs were peaceful, a strategy labelled as \\"Blumenkrieg\\" (Flower War).Evidenced in a January 1937 speech prior to the outcry over the bombing of the Basque city of Guernica, known by the Luftwaffe as Operation R√ºgen.

Debt owed by Franco and the Nationals to Germany rose quickly upon purchasing German material, and required financial assistance from Germany as the Republicans had access to Spain's gold reserve.  Portugal  Portuguese Republic Upon the outbreak of the civil war, Portuguese Prime Minister Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar almost immediately supported the National forces.Tom Gallagher. Portugal: a twentieth-century interpretation. Manchester, England, UK: Manchester University Press, 1983. Pp. 86. Salazar's Estado Novo regime held tense relations with the Spanish Republic that held Portuguese dissidents to his regime in it.Filipe Ribeiro De Meneses. Franco and the Spanish Civil War. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 96. Portugal played a critical role in supplying Franco's forces with ammunition and many other logistical resources.Antony Beevor.

Despite its discreet direct military involvement ‚Äî restrained to a somewhat \\"semi-official\\" endorsement, by its authoritarian regime, of an 8,000‚Äì12,000-strong volunteer force, the so-called \\"Viriatos\\" ‚Äî for the whole duration of the conflict, Portugal was instrumental in providing the National faction with a vital logistical organization and by reassuring Franco and his allies that no interference whatsoever would hinder the supply traffic directed to the Nationals, crossing the borders of the two Iberian countries ‚Äî the Nationals used to refer to Lisbon as \\"the port of Castile\\".Antony Beevor. The Battle for Spain; The Spanish Civil War, 1936‚Äì1939. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2006. Pp. 116, 198. In 1938, with Franco's victory increasingly certain, Portugal recognized Franco's regime and after the war in 1939 signed a treaty of friendship and non-aggression pact that was known as the Iberian Pact. Portugal played an important diplomatic role in supporting the Franco regime, including by insisting to the United Kingdom that Franco sought to replicate Salazar's Estado Novo and not Mussolini's Fascist Italy.  Holy See  Vatican City Among many influential Catholics in Spain, mainly composed of conservative Traditionalists and people belonging to pro-Monarchic groups, the religious persecution was squarely and based on evidence probably rightly mostly blamed on the government of the Republic. The ensuing outrage was used after the 1936 coup by the nationalist/monarchist faction and readily extended itself. The Catholic Church took the side of the rebel government and defined the religious Spaniards who had been persecuted in Republican areas as 'martyrs of the faith'. The devout Catholics who supported the Spanish Republic, included high-ranking officers of the Popular Army such as republican Catholic general Vicente Rojo Lluch, as well as the Catholic Basque nationalists who opposed the rebel faction.Stanley G. Payne. The Franco regime, 1936‚Äì1975. Madison, Wisconsin, USA; London, England, UK: University of Wisconsin Press, 1987. Pp. 201. Initially the Vatican held itself from declaring too openly its support of the rebel side in the war, although it had long allowed high ecclesiastical figures in Spain to do so and to define the conflict as a 'Crusade'. Throughout the war, however, Francoist propaganda and influential Spanish Catholics labelled the secular Republic as \\"the enemy of God and the Church\\" and denounced the Republic, holding it responsible for anti-clerical activities, such as shutting down Catholic schools, as well as the killing of priests and nuns by exalted mobs and the desecration of religious buildings.Juli√†n Casanova. The Spanish Republic and Civil War. Cambridge University Press, 2010. Pp. 139. Forsaken by the Western European powers, the republican side mainly depended from Soviet military assistance, which played into the hands of the portrayal of the Spanish Republic as a 'Marxist' and godless state in the Francoist propaganda. By means of its extensive diplomatic network the Holy See used its influence to lobby for the rebel side. During an International Art Exhibition in Paris in 1937, in which both the Francoist and the Republican governments were present, the Holy See allowed the Nationalist pavilion to display its exhibition under the Vatican flag, for the rebel government's flag was still not recognized.Antony Beevor, The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939, By 1938, the Holy See had already officially recognized Franco's Spanish State, being one of the first to do so.Stanley G. Payne. The Franco regime, 1936‚Äì1975. Madison, Wisconsin, USA; London, England, UK: University of Wisconsin Press, 1987. Pp. 156.

Born in Las Palmas, Canary Islands, to British parents, he was educated in Spain and England.\\"Books on Ibiza\\", Ibiza History & Culture. Having qualified as a chartered accountant by the age of 21, he worked for Price Waterhouse in Paris for a couple of years and then dropped out, first to Ibiza and then Menorca. Following his passion for islands, he subsequently moved to Lealt, a remote house on the Scottish island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides where, in the 1960s and 70s with his partner Susan Searight, he researched and painstakingly excavated numerous coastal sites. His many papers have established Jura as a significant Mesolithic area. Whilst at Lealt, as well as his archaeological work, he lived off-grid, built his own loom from driftwood, invented a spinning wheel from recycled parts, and established a workshop to spin, dye and weave the local blackface wool into rugs. He was a committed human rights researcher and activist, particularly in the Western Sahara and Mauritania, contributing influential research reports to the Minority Rights Group and also the Anti-Slavery Society. His report on slavery in Mauritania has been widely cited. The John Mercer Human Rights Trust, set up after his death, commemorates this strand of his life. Mercer's first books were for young people, Lizard Island Expedition and The Cormorant and the Stranger, drawing on his own experiences in the Balearics. He wrote an illustrated guidebook to the islands of Colonsay, Gigha and Jura and several books on the Canary Islands. An independent thinker with eclectic interests, he also wrote about, amongst other topics, hand-spinning, communes, and Scottish devolution. He was a Fellow of the Institute of Linguists, of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, and of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.

Based in Dhaka, this non-registered, non-funded and non- formal group was run by a pool of volunteers. Boys of Bangladesh operated since 2002 solely through a Yahoo! Group as the primary dating site for Bangladeshi gay men before the advent of Grindr. In addition to online activities, BoB arranged social get-togethers such as parties. Boys of Bangladesh was an apolitical group and had no intentions of repealing Penal Code 377. History BoB started out as an online dating Yahoo! Group in late 2002. One of BoB's founders was Dhaka-born Quazi Haque, currently residing in Sydney, Australia, created the platform out of his determination to \\"provide a support network for the gay population of Bangladesh\\". However, both groups were closed down by Yahoo! authorities by the end of 2002. Nonetheless, after reopening on 4 January 2003, BoB remains active to date, having undergone changes, such as changing its name to Boys of Bangladesh. Initially, BoB mostly remained an online group with sporadic, closely guarded, offline social events for its selected members, staying devoid of any political edge. It was not until May 2005 when it attempted to assert itself politically by sending a letter to The Daily Star newspaper, regarding the first International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia, which was spearheaded by Tanveer Rouf. The letter, which presented a brief overview of the situation of gay community in Bangladesh and highlighted its main problems, met mostly with negative response, caused BoB to decide to stay apolitical. Here is an excerpt from the article: \\"Indeed, the beginnings of that discussion did emerge, when a response to the homophobic letter in the Daily Star was published in the newspaper. But BOB‚Äôs continued stance as an apolitical group was then made clear to the group‚Äôs members, with a mass mailing that warned that no further discussion on the issue would be allowed on the message boards. As such, BOB definitively abandoned political activism ‚Äì banning further discussion on the publicity incident and instead, according to the wishes of its members, started planning for a disco party. Since that time, BOB has remained an online gay group that caters solely to the entertainment and friendship needs of its members, without any reference to political issues whatsoever.\\" Around the same time, a safe sex campaign was initiated, offering HIV testings at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research in Dhaka, and Boys of Bangladesh knotted co-operation with a Bangladeshi human rights organisation Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK) for a survey on sexual diversity. The number of group members had significantly grown by 2006, however, the state of emergency introduced in the country stopped BoB from organising any events for some period of time. In May 2008, BoB celebrated the International Day Against Homophobia (IDAHO) at a caf√© in Dhaka, which marked the first time when BoB appeared openly in public as a group of gay activists with the acknowledgment of the venue authority. In February 2009, with the help from the Norwegian National Association for Lesbian and Gay Liberation, BoB organised the first LGBT-related workshop in Bangladesh, titled \\"Workshop on Sexual Diversity, Partnership Building and Networking\\". November saw an arrangement of another event which met with positive reception. Subsequently, Boys of Bangladesh secured an office space that would serve as its headquarters and resource centre. A rainbow flag was hoisted in the office premise to announce its existence as well as express its solidarity with the worldwide LGBT movement, which also marked the first time a rainbow flag had been unfurled in a public place in Bangladesh. In October 2010, BoB took part in the second instalment of \\"Under the Rainbow\\", a cultural event initiated by the Goethe-Institut in Bangladesh to discuss LGBT issues in the country. The five-day festival included movie screenings, art exhibitions and musical performances, bringing together leading human rights activists from within the country and abroad. In April 2011, BoB organised a conference with Bandhu Social Welfare Society (BSWS) and South Asian Human Rights Commission of Marginalized Sexualities and Genders (SAHRCMSG), and contributed to production of a short film Without Any Window of His Own, which was later screened at the International Festival of Documentary Film on Liberation and Human Rights in Dhaka's Central Public Library. 2012 saw further events organised by BoB, including a series of \\"Let's Talk\\" workshops and a celebration of IDAHO with the presence of international representatives.

Critics of the current patent system, such as Joseph E. Stiglitz, say that patents fail to provide incentives for innovations which are not commercially marketable. Stiglitz provides the idea of prizes instead of patents to be awarded in order to further advance solutions to global problems such as AIDS. Background Patents essentially provide a temporary monopoly on a product to the first inventor or firm which comes up with the product. Patents vary in length but are designed to last long enough for the innovator to make a return on investment. The nature of patents makes them an incentive so long as the product being invented is distributed to consumers through markets. While patented products are in the market, the producer can place any price on the product, regardless of the price of production which typically dictates prices in markets. If a product is not being distributed through markets then a patent cannot provide proper incentive for innovation. Patents do however provide gain through the restriction of information to others. Stiglitz identifies this as a problem of patents for the innovation of drugs and other products being distributed not with the purpose of making a profit, but to solve global problems. Offering a prize as opposed to a patent, according to Stiglitz, would address the lack of incentive for problems such as disease in developing countries, and it would provide products immediately affordable instead of pending a patent expiration. Awarding prizes offers a fixed amount appropriate for reimbursing research into drugs. Today, many drug companies spend much of money earned through patents on marketing and advertising as opposed to the research for the actual drugs.Brezis M (2008). \\"Big pharma and health care: unsolvable conflict of interests between private enterprise and public health\\". Isr J Psychiatry Relat Sci 45 (2): 83‚Äì9; discussion 90‚Äì4. Stiglitz goes on to assert that until generic versions of drugs reach the shelves, which occurs after a patent expires, the costs burden consumers due to prices not being dictated by the markets. These burdens are overwhelming in developing countries and Stiglitz suggests they be lowered by offering prizes instead of patents. Stiglitz discusses the idea of using foreign aid assistance funds to finance prizes as it would provide greater foreign aid than what funds are being used for currently.http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue42/Stiglitz42.pdf United States Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont put forward legislation in the United States Senate in 2005 and 2007 under H.R. 417 and S.2210. Sanders has been a longtime proponent of Stiglitz‚Äô ideas, and favors a system of incentives for innovation in medicine and pharmaceuticals over a system of patents, which he asserts grant company monopolies on drugs and drive up pharmaceutical prices. The Medical Innovation Prize Fund Act S1137 and S1138 The two bills proposed on May 26, 2011 by Senator Bernie Sanders would completely remove legal barriers to the manufacture and sale of generic drugs. The bills will give the government the right to set specific goals and direct research to certain areas of medicine. S1137 would apply to all prescription drugs, and S1138 is focused on HIV/AIDS medications. The bills call for both the government and private insurance companies to fund the \\"Medical Innovation Prize Fund\\". According to the S1137 bill, the innovation fund would create a fund of .55% of GDP, $80 billion of GDP based on 2010 numbers. S1138 calls for a .02% GDP fund for HIV/AIDS innovation prizes that amounts to about $3 billion a year. In a statement made at a subcommittee meeting, Senator Sanders said, \\"It simply blew me away ‚Äî and would blow anyone‚Äôs mind away ‚Äî that one drug, Atripla, costs $25,000 per year\\". He called this bill, ‚ÄúFairly radical for the U.S. Congress.‚Äù According to estimates, proponents of the bill believe that the costs of the prizes would be offset by the introduction of generic drugs and the reduction of monopoly power in the pharmaceutical industry. Sanders believes that these bills will save private insurers, Medicaid, and other government assistance programs money. One of the goals of the bill is to \\"de-link research and development incentives from product prices\\" along with getting rid of patents and what the bill's author asserts to be monopoly power. It aims to free research and development by proposing a possible \\"Open Source Dividend\\" element. This means that a percentage of the prize money from the innovation funds would go to those persons or communities that allow access to knowledge, data, etc. to public domains and offer free access to patents. Senator Sanders and other proponents of both bills assert that the prize funds will give incentives for manufacturers to seek innovative treatments for illnesses and diseases that are more important to society. In addition, they state that these funds will lower drugs prices, along with what they claim to be wasteful research and development costs. This bill has been favored by Joseph Stiglitz. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have tried such a prize fund model. In their model, all applicants for funding from the Gates foundation must waive all claims to patents. ‚ÄúA World Health Organization (WHO) report, called 'Research and Development to Meet health Needs in Developing Countries', backs prize funds, saying it is a financially viable model‚Äù In 2012 the two bills were referred to the committee level in the Senate. They have not been put to a vote in either the Senate or the House. In 2009-2010 only 3% of all bills proposed in the senate were enacted. Other areas for prize models over patents US President Barack Obama has pushed for prizes innovation sponsoring 150 contests across 40 agencies in 2010. NASA paid out $6 million in prizes to companies since 2005 for innovation. Between 2000-2007 certain groups put $250 million into technologies that range from robotic arms and tuberculosis tests, according to Brian Vastag of The Washington Post. Criticism Criticisms of prize funds focus on the impact of prizes as limited by their size, scope, and nature. Prizes large enough to replace patents as incentives to develop innovative new products require large up-front costs for taxpayers. According to the Global Intellectual Property Center, studies show that prizes are better at proving a concept than bringing concrete, useful technologies into existence.http://www.theglobalipcenter.com/sites/default/files/reports/documents/Prizes__Patent_Pools.pdf Another criticism made by the Global Intellectual Property Center is that prizes will never be enough to reward lucky breaks that have brought about the most important innovations. Also, the center argues that prizes do not create incentives to drive continuous cycle of advances and improvements because prizes are finite and limited. The Global Intellectual Property Center also believes that prizes focus narrowly on certain acts or on the \\"next new thing\\", and that prizes can act as distractions from more significant innovations. They also assert that prizes do not hold researchers and inventors accountable for the findings of works or creations. The center argues that prizes in turn give rights to a product to a government, who then gives rights to the entire public. In the future, if there are any problems or questions with the creation, or drug, it will be impossible to determine who is responsible for the flaw. Within the pharmaceutical industry, prize theory has gotten much criticism. One of the main criticisms is that giving rewards in the form of prize money to drug companies for producing innovative drugs will not be seen for many years while the drug is tested in the market, and that prize funds would not reward pharmaceuticals for producing different versions of drugs; ‚Äúme-too‚Äù drugs. These variations are seen as part of the bigger problem by Senator Sanders.

It was founded in 1862. French school (French: √âcole Fran√ßaise) is a school located on D√∂belnsgatan 9 in Stockholm, founded in 1862 originally as a girls' school of the Roman Catholic religious congregation Sisters of St. Joseph from France. The school follows the Swedish system of education, but all the students study French. The school's students are mainly Swedish children, but also francophone students study there. The current head principal is Bj√∂rn Kullgard. The first years on Kammakargatan 36 The small farm on Kammakargatan 36 was purchased by Mary de Champs in 1862, a French-speaking Belgian woman who was born in England. She already came to Sweden in 1850 for her son Jean, who would become a naval officer and educated in Sweden.Franska Skolan, author Lennart Jarnhammar, sid 23. Along with Florentine Modelon she received the support of the Catholic Church in their home country to start a school in Sweden, and in October 1862 they found the property on Kammakargatan. An important decision behind this was the so-called authorization letter signed by Charles XV July 4, 1868 and gave mademoiselle Modelon right to buy and own real estate in Sweden, even though they were Catholics. The property went for a total of 22,600 francs,Franska Skolan, author Lennart Jarnhammar, sid 24. approximately 1,026,381 Swedish kronor today. In the small garden behind the house they started the school that began to operate in October. The property was located in a rural part of Stockholm that was not so built up. Madame de Champs was responsible for teaching while Mademoiselle Modelon studied Swedish. Otherwise they were joined by the French girl Josefine Chervai, who served as a maid and Anders Jansson as a farmhand.Franska Skolan, author Lennart Jarnhammar, sid 27 In 1865 the school had 22 Catholic girls enrolled, mostly children of poor workers and craftsmen in Stockholm. During this time, the school was also a combined orphanage, first in 1869 pupils began living at home while studying at the school. Sisters came continuously from France to serve as teachers in French at school, and Swedish teachers educated the students in Swedish. The economy during this time remained strained despite annual contributions from the Catholic L'Oeuvre pontificale de la propagation de la foi in Lyon, and they were completely dependent on this. Moving and the years on Drottninggatan 108 In 1868 it was decided to move the school; now the number of students reached 55. The property is Drottninggatan 108 was an enclosed courtyard with two more houses. A woman who came to play a big role in the early school years on Drottninggatan was Jenny M√ºller. She was the daughter of one of six Swedish women who in 1858 was exiled in the so-called convert process. These women had converted to Catholicism and had to leave Sweden. Jenny M√ºller thus grew up in France. In 1862, 18 years old, she returned to Sweden. In 1870, two years after the school's relocation, mademoiselle Modelon died only 41 years old on 13 April. In the coming years on Drottninggatan the school changed radically. Between 1872 and 1878 the number of students doubled from 43 to 112. And where the school initially had poor students the bourgeoisie now started to put their children in the school, there was certainly an attraction to the French language and culture, which they believed to be refined.Franska Skolan, author Lennart Jarnhammar, sid 49 The school did not deny students based on politics or economics, and famous socialist Hjalmar Branting enrolled his daughter Sonja in the school in 1897, where she was well received.Franska Skolan, author Lennart Jarnhammar, sid 56 During the 1880s had sanitary conditions deteriorated substantially in Stockholm and Albert Lindhagen presented a plan that would transform Stockholm into a modern stone town. Drottninggatan, where the school is now based, would change and the school building were to be demolished. Therefore, the school again had to look for new properties. At the end of 1909 they found what they were looking for, at D√∂belnsgatan 7 and 9. A major renovation was needed because there were homes in the houses, and October 1, 1910 the school bought the property for 230 000,Franska Skolan, author Lennart Jarnhammar, sid 64 in today's money 12,200,663 SEK . The last graduation at Drottninggatan 108 were held on 30 May 1911.Franska Skolan, author Lennart Jarnhammar, sid 64 D√∂belnsgatan and the hills surrounding St. John's Church October 15, 1911 the inauguration were held at the new property at D√∂belnsgatan, and the party took place in the new bright gymnasium, which was considered very modern for its time. Dagens Nyheter wrote a summary of the inauguration: \\"Towards the end of his speech d: r Westrin turned to the French Minister Thi√©baud, who along with his sister had been one of the school's first disciples, and spoke in French. The French Minister thanked d:r Westin and wished the school success, they sang Gounod's' Gloire √† toi 'and the beautiful party was over. The school, which currently has over 100 pupils, is wished well upon the bright, beautiful facilities, it now has received. In the first and second floor are classrooms, common rooms, and teacher's lounge located. .. In the uppermost floor of the school foreign and some Swedish teachers reside\\".Franska Skolan, author Lennart Jarnhammar, sid 65 The school's new premises at D√∂belnsgatan is located on Brunkebergs√•sen northern heights, beautifully located next to St. John's Church, Stockholm. In the late 1920s began to organize travel to France, with the first trip to Cognac in 1929, which today has developed into exchange studies to Morocco and Canada, but also other parts of the Francophone world. Present 1968 was the first year with boys in the school, who came from Carlsson's school because of lack of space there and sent a few students without telling that they were boys.Franska Skolan, author Lennart Jarnhammar, sid 101 Since 1973, both girls and boys attend the school.http://www.franskaskolan.se/54-2/skolans-historia/ 40% of school students today are boys.http://www.franskaskolan.se/grundskolan/vanliga- fragor-svar/ Primary school students wear today the classic blue coats with the school emblem on the left side of the chest, which was introduced when the school uniform vanished, to prevent private clothes enhancing snobbery.W√§stberg, Per (2013).

The film was thought be lost for decades but a copy of it was found in 2010. Plot Oswald drives his uncovered car, heading towards a night club. After parking his car at a sidewalk by the place, he was immediately flagged down by the bellhop who tells him that parking there is not permitted. As a solution, Oswald compresses his car with his hands until it is hand-sized. The rabbit drops the tiny vehicle in his shorts and gives the bellhop a raspberry before proceeding to the club's entrance. Coming to the night club also was a large wolf. Holding onto the wolf's garments is his cub who refuses to separate from him. Frustrated by the persistent holding, the wolf puts his offspring inside large pajamas and hangs it on a light post. The wolf cub was able to come out of the pajamas but was saddened upon losing sight of his father. He came to the night club's entrance and asked \\"Is my father in there?\\" A voice from inside tells him not to stay by the doors. The wolf cub would ask the same question to a number of people but would never get the answer he wanted. Inside the night club, the patrons are dancing as the musicians play the tune Alexander's Ragtime Band. Everyone appears to be having a pleasant time, especially Oswald who stands on a chair, rocking it back and forth. The next event features four dogs in tuxedos who sing part of the song Sweet Adeline on stage. However, their performance wasn't well received by the guests. Still enjoying the atmosphere nonetheless, Oswald dances on his table. Sitting by and sharing his table is the large wolf. As he dances, the rabbit accidentally kicks the wolf in the nose, much to the latter's disturbance. The wolf then grabs Oswald's head and rips it off his body. Miraculously, Oswald survives and is able to put himself back together. As retribution, Oswald throws a jar on the wolf's head. While the wolf tries to take the jar off his head, a cow laughs at him. As a response, the wolf kicks the cow, who in turn, gets laughed at by a mouse. The cow spits at the mouse who then gets laughed at by an elephant. The mouse pulls the elephant's trunk and lets go, causing that animal to trample on the other guests. As a result, everyone gets into a fist fight. Some patrons were able to flee but the rest remained in the trouble. A police car arrives at the scene and takes the whole night club building away. Knowing his father is still inside, the wolf cub tries to follow the moving building but cannot keep up. As he stops, he comes across an opaque telephone booth at a park. The wolf cub asks his question but only receives silence. Desperate, the little wolf rips open the booth to find a Tibetan man making a phone call inside. \\"Is my father in there?\\" The wolf cub's quote \\"Is my father in there?\\" would be reused in two later cartoons produced by Lantz. It was a parody of pro-temperance works published several years earlier (Father, Dear Father being the most common example) which used similar words.

M. Harcourt, was an Australian writer. Life John Harcourt was born on the 2 March 1902, in Katanning, Western Australia. He had two elder sisters, the younger, Jessica. His father was a surveyor and the child of Methodist missionaries to a local Aboriginal encampment. His mother was bi-polar the gene determined through Jessica's descendants. The family suffered her unpredictable psychotic rages when manic. As a small boy, he was sent by train to the Methodist boarding school, Wesley College, Melbourne, but ran away due to bullying in 1915. He did not want to return home because of his mother. At first, he survived as a sundowner, walking and doing odd jobs in return for a meal and a place to sleep the night. He also learned skills of a jackaroo and worked on cattle stations. He turned his hand to almost any job he could get as he travelled up towards Darwin, including day labouring on building and railway construction sites, teaching Charleston, and racing cars. Eventually, he worked his way along the coast to Broome where he got involved in pearling eventually becoming the captain of a pearling lugger. After three years he found a particularly large and perfectly shaped pearl, and his share of the ¬£13,000 value was ¬£2,000. Then aged twenty, sick of physical work and wanting to earn a living using his brain, he flew down to Perth and there educated himself in the State Library with the intention of becoming a writer. There he met and married his first wife, Sylvia, with whom he had a son, Peter. The marriage ended after only four years when his wife fell in love with a doctor. She took Peter, but Harcourt sent money for his education. During that time he reconnected and worked with his father, a surveyor. He began sending articles to newspapers. Eventually, he was offered a job writing for Truth and so moved to Melbourne. He specialised in articles on business and investment. The newspaper was a Fabian and mildly sensationalist rag. Harcourt became a member of the Australian Communist Party and began working on another book, Upsurge, published in 1934. It the first novel to be banned by the Commonwealth Book Censorship Board, on the grounds that it portrayed a (fictional) communist uprising in a positive light. Most of the books were burned, but Harcourt managed to rescue three original copies. At around this time, his colleague, the journalist and writer, Betty Rowlands, introduced him to Fay, who became his second wife. Betty also introduced him to Justus Jorgensen and the libertarian crowd of artists around Montsalvat at Eltham, not far to the northeast of Melbourne. There, due to the Great Depression and the shortage of affordable housing, Harcourt became interested in building houses in pis√© de terre. He researched the technique in the architecture library at Melbourne University and began teaching himself by building his own place, called Clay Newnham (after the Harcourt family seat in Oxfordshire, England). He kept writing as a journalist during the time he was learning the rammed earth technique, how to build smoke-free fireplaces and all the technical aspects of traditional vernacular style for the material. 1945 when war broke out, Harcourt, relieved to be too old to fight as a soldier, took a job in intelligence as an editor of letters from soldiers to their families. It involving using a razor to cut out anything the government did not want the populace to know. In 1955, he divorced Fay due to an affair with Diana Elizabeth Whitehead. Diana became pregnant so they travelled to England where she could divorce her first husband, and where she gave birth in 1956 to their first daughter, Amanda Sarah Anne. They married in a registry office shortly afterwards and then drove through France to Italy. There they lived for six months in a villa in a small village on the Adriatic Coast called Ronchi. They returned Australia in 1957 and rented a bungalow at Bilgola Beach (on the Pittwater Peninsula to the north of Sydney.) Harcourt designed a solar passive house, based mostly on Diana's ideas and her memories of their villa in Italy, and so they named it Ronchi. Built at the top of Beauty Drive at Whale Beach it features Australia's first flat concrete roof using a design of Harcourt's which has never since been replicated. It has the unique feature of dipping by three inches in the centre to capture water as an aid to cooling and insulation. A covering of gravel was used to slow evaporation. Due to two duodenal ulcers, which were then believed to be due to stress, Diana talked Harcourt into retiring. He had built fourteen houses in the Eltham area and still owned several of them, so he drew an income from rent. Diana had an inheritance which was managed by the Public Trustee, which Harcourt found to be over conservative and not doing well. He convinced Diana to get a personal stockbroker and accountant and used his own knowledge gained during the years of reporting on finance to assist in decisions. The plan worked well financially. Soon after they moved into the new house in January 1959, Diana gave birth to their second child, Nicholina Sandra Caroline at the Seventh Day Adventist Hospital on the North Shore. It became the beginning of the unhappiness in their marriage because Diana had deliberately conceived for a second time without consulting Harcourt. He never forgave her. They began drinking. The alcoholism slowly became a serious problem for both of them, with Diana hospitalised three times due to coma. In 1968, when Russia invaded Czechoslovakia, he left the Communist party and became anti-communist. Through his connections with Montsalvat he became friend with many members of the Sydney Push and established a dinner club at which they met once a month. He sold one of his houses and bought a yacht; sailing became his main pastime on weekends. The marriage stayed together unhappily for fourteen and a half years until he died of heart failure and double pneumonia on 3 September 1971. His death was a deliberate choice. Three months earlier, he had stopped taking the drug that prevented the build-up of fluid in his lungs, knowing what the outcome would be. He talked it over with the family doctor and Diana, to gain their consent that when the time came, there would be no emergency revival. He had a horror of senility and did not want to live long enough to experience frontal-lobe dementia, one of the effects of lack of oxygen supply to the brain caused by heart failure. A strict atheist who disapproved of all religion, an existentialist, and libertarian, he was buried in the non- denominational section of Mona Vale Cemetery. He was mentioned twice in the Australian editions of Who's Who in 1954 and 55. His book Upsurge is now on the reading list for Australian Socialist Realist Literature at Perth University.

He studied law at first with Florence McCarthy, who was elected to the New York City Marine Court in 1850. Smyth then studied law and with John McKeon, and was admitted to the bar in 1855. McKeon had been appointed United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in 1854, and appointed Smyth as one of his Assistant US Attorneys. At the end of McKeon's term in 1858, Smyth and McKeon formed a law partnership which lasted until the end of 1878. Smyth was a school commissioner from 1863 to 1865. In November 1875, Smyth ran on the Tammany Hall ticket for Recorder of New York City, but was defeated by John K.

The flag of Carillon was flown by the troops of General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm during the Battle of Carillon, which was fought by the French and Canadian forces against those of the British in July 1758 at Fort Carillon.Article provenant d'¬´ Histoire des drapeaux qu√©b√©cois : Carillon Sacr√©-C≈ìur ¬ª, Luc Bouvier, professeur au Coll√®ge de l'Outaouais, 12 avril 2004 In 2009, it was displayed at the Mus√©e de l'Am√©rique fran√ßaise in Quebec City.  Discovery  In March 1882, Ernest Gagnon wrote that Louis de Gonzague Baillarg√© (1808‚Äì1896), lawyer, businessman, and philanthropist in Quebec, \\"having read in an old chronicle that a flag from Carillon and suspended in the church of the Recollets in Quebec City had been saved during the fire of the church in 1796,\\" began researching in order to find the flag. In November or December 1847, he met the last of the R√©collet priests, Father Louis Marinet dit Bonami (1764‚Äì1848), in his residence on Saint-Vallier Street near the Quebec General Hospital. Towards mid-1848, Baillarg√© returned to Bonami, who related the history of the flag of Carillon. Baillarg√© died April 7 of that year from a stroke which occurred in January. Father Berey (1720‚Äì1800), superior of the R√©collets, was chaplain to Montcalm's troops. When he returned to the monastery after the campaign of 1758, he brought back with him a flag which was torn and ripped. He mentioned at the convent that it had seen the battle of Carillon. This flag had been suspended from the vault of the R√©collet church. On September 6, 1796, a fire which had burnt a house on Saint-Louis Street had also set fire to the convent and church of the R√©collets. The conflagration having taken hold in the steeple of the church, the roof burnt before the rest of the church. While one of the brothers was saving a chest filled with objects thrown into it, he crossed the nave of the church, and the old flag fell in front of him. Father Louis took it with him and placed it in the chest with the other objects.Ernest Gagnon, ¬´ Le drapeau de Carillon ¬ª, la Revue canadienne, mars 1882, p. 129‚Äì139; cited below as Gagnon Ia.

Description  The banner dates back to the 17th century, confirmed by textile expert Jean-Michel Tuchscherer: \\"The flag is without doubt an exceptional piece from the 17th century\\" [Robitaille]. As for the coat of arms under the Madonna now missing, it was most probably that of Charles de la Boische, Marquis de Beauharnois (1671‚Äì1749), Governor of New France from 1726 to 1747: Argent, a fess and in chief three martlets sable. Only the governor had the right to inscribe his personal arms on a banner with the arms of France, and only Beauharnois had eagles as supporters. The flag was probably fabricated around 1726, date of the arrival of Beauharnois, and it was known to have been flown on May 29, 1732, for the order of Saint Louis, with its motto Bellicae virtutis praemium.

R., and J. Van Tassell. ‚ÄúSpecies: Gobioclinus Gobio, Goggle-Eye Blenny, Palehead Blenny.‚Äù Shorefishes - The Fishes - Species, 2019, biogeodb.stri.si.edu/caribbean/en/thefishes/species/3947., also called Gobioclinus gobio. Its common name is the palehead blenny, and is sometimes referred to as the goggle-eye blenny. It can be identified by its greenish top, red belly, and multicolored banding. L. gobio is a benthic organism with a wide range, taking up residence in a number of coastal environments from Florida to Brazil. This means the fish can live in equatorial, subtropical, and tropical climatic zones. It is endemic to the West Atlantic, but not to the greater Caribbean area. Its diet consists mainly of different molluscs and echinoderms.  Anatomy and morphology  Generally, individuals of Gobioclinus gobio are 2.8 to 4.0 cmFroese, Rainer. ‚ÄúGobioclinus Gobio Summary Page.‚Äù Edited by Estelita Emily Capuli, FishBase, www.fishbase.de/summary/Gobioclinus-gobio.html.. The maximum length of a male palehead blenny is 6.5 cm. Gobioclinus gobio has an anatomy common in Labrosomids, with a small, elongated body. The blenny has cycloid (meaning smooth to the touch) scales on the posterior body. Scales in the series 40-69 are in a lateral line, which aids in movement. Some posterior scales in the series don‚Äôt have sensory tubes. On the posteroventral surface are the gill membranes, which occur continuously. The stomach cavity has a lining that is white and dotted with dark spots. Gobioclinus gobio has a broad, grey-brown head and a rounded snout. Its mouth is large and protruding, exposing the back of the upper jawbone. There are more than 2 pores on the tip of its chin. On either side of the head are two or more heavily branched cirri, which are tentacle-like structures lacking features of a traditional tentacle. The cirri are directly anterior to the origin of the dorsal fin. There may also be flaps in front of the nostrils, eyes, and nape of the fish. The palehead blenny lacks an opercular ocellus, which is a colored spot on the head resembling an eye. This feature is common of shorefishes in the greater Caribbean area, so this is one of the markers that Gobioclinus gobio is a non-endemic species. The blenny's jaw, or maxillary bone, is exposed posteriorly, and has multiple layers of teeth. The outer row consists of large teeth resembling canines or incisors in the upper jaw. Behind this row sit smaller teeth in patches, rather than continuously. Teeth may also grow on the vomer bone or on the palatine, an area on the roof of the mouth. The palatine teeth are significantly larger than the vomer teeth. Gobioclinus gobio has 3 sets of fins: the dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins, which each consist of a number of rays. Its long dorsal fin consists of 19 dorsal spines. Between the spines and rays of the dorsal fin is a notch. The anal fin consists of 2 spines and 19 segmented rays. Both the dorsal and anal spines are long, often flexible, and longest anteriorly. The pectoral fins commonly have 13 rays. Behind the pectoral fin‚Äôs base are the pelvic fins, which have one spine and far fewer segmented soft rays (approximately 2 or 3), with a shorter innermost ray that overlaps the middle ray. This singular spine is not externally visible. The shortest pelvic fin ray is over double the length of the longest ray. All of the fin rays of the palehead blenny are unbranched. The blenny has a unique coloration and marbled pattern, with 4-5 brown and light bands on the body, but not on the fins. The second band is widest at the top. Females may present red spots while males have no coloration. The dorsal and anal fins have very faint markings. A narrow dark line marks the base of the caudal fin. The peritoneum, which is a membrane lining the fish‚Äôs body, is white with large pigment cells called melanophores. Much of the internal anatomy of Gobioclinus gobio is unknown.  Reproduction  Gobioclinus gobio's eggs are laid in benthic environments. The larva are pelagic. Little is known about this specie‚Äôs reproduction, and more research is required.  Distribution and habitat  Gobioclinus gobio is a marine organism that inhabitants subtropical reefs within depths of 0-15 meters, on rocky shores with heavy vegetation, including algal mats and seagrass beds. It prefers reef habitats with coral and limestone formations, and soft substrates such as sand and gravel. Gobioclinus gobio populates the Western Atlantic coast of Latin America and around the West Indies, from Mexico to the islands of the Lesser Antilles. The blenny‚Äôs distribution likely extends to the Western coast of northern South America, as well as the Antilles island chain. The blenny prefers temperatures of 26.5-28.2 degrees Celsius, with an average of 27.5 degrees Celsius.  Diet  Gobioclinus gobio is a carnivore known to feed on bony fishes and a number of mobile, benthic organisms including worms, crustaceans such as shrimps and crabs, gastropods, and bivalves. It also eats sea stars, sea cucumbers, and sea urchins.  Behavior  Gobioclinus gobio hides in sea anemones as a method of avoiding predatorsHanlon, R. T., and R. F. Hixon. \\"Behavioral Associations of Coral Reef Fishes with the Sea Anemone Condylactis Gigantea in the Dry Tortugas, Florida.\\" Bulletin of Marine Science, vol. 39, Iss. 1, pp. 130-134,.. In order to reside unharmed among the stinging tentacles of the anemone, it has developed both physiological and behavioral adaptations, and is one of nine Caribbean reef fishes recorded to display this characteristic. L. gobio is stung during the acclimation period, which can take several minutes to hours. The behavioral mechanism by which L. gobio acclimates to the anemone is hypothesized to be by a factor of the fish‚Äôs ability to alter its mucous coating in order to avoid stinging. This negates the need for the fish to acquire mucous from the anemone during acclimation. The mechanism of the physiological adaption is unknown, and more research is required. There are lateral lines on the front sides of Gobioclinus gobio's body. These allow the blenny to communicate with its school to move together in a school formation.  Conservation status  On the IUCN Red List, Gobioclinus gobio is classified as least concern as of October 18, 2007. It has a low vulnerability, meaning it is not expected to become endangered due to human threats. Gobioclinus gobio is harmless to humans.  Ecology  The blenny's trophic level was determined based on its size and the trophic level of its closest relatives. It is 3.6 ¬±0.6.

Early works  Graduated from the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in 1970, Jean-Paul Viguier, with Jean Bossu and Georges-Henri Pingusson, founded the teaching unit n¬∞5. 3 years later, he received a \\"master of city planning in urban design\\" at the Harvard University, and, as he came back in France, he hosted a section of urban architecture in the journal Urbanisme. From 1975-1992, projects were carried out in association with Jean-Fran√ßois Jodry. In 1981, he won the \\"first prize of the jury\\" in the competition for the Opera Bastille and then, in 1983, the \\"first tie price\\" for the project head Defense. In 1986, he won alongside Alain Provost, Patrick Berger and Gilles Cl√©ment, the competition for the construction of the Parc Andr√©-Citro√´n in Paris, whose creation will last 6 years (1992-2002) soon after they won the Seville Expo‚Äô92 contest for the French Pavilion. In 1988, he designed The Atrium : headquarters of the Caisse des Depots et Consignations in Boulogne-Billancourt. In 1990, he won the competition organized by the Public Establishment for the development of the Defence area for the construction of the Heart defense complex at the Esso headquarters location. Then he realized the headquarters of France T√©l√©visions in Paris, as well as many others, such as Alstom in Saint-Ouen and AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb in Rueil-Malmaison.  Jean-Paul Viguier et Associ√©s practice  Jean-Paul Viguier Architecture and Associates works on a very wide range of building types. In the area of housing, with achievements in Paris (Bercy, Dupleix), Cr√©teil, Asnieres-sur-Seine, Clichy and recently (in 2009) in the 15th district of the capital, rue de la Convention. In the cultural field, the firm realized the Cathedral library (now named \\"Jean-Falala\\") at Reims in 2002, and restructured the Natural History Museum of Toulouse. She also designed urban facilities such as the layout of the site of the Pont du Gard and built an archaeological museum on the same site in 2000. The fields of activity of the practice is completed by the making of office buildings, as Angle in Boulogne-Billancourt (2008), seat of the Journal L'√âquipe, the headquarters of IBM Europe in Bois-Colombes (2009), the seat of Prisma Presse inGennevilliers or Heart Mediterranean, the islet of D3 ZAC Joliette Marseille (2008). Finally, the Majunga tower is located in the heart of La D√©fense. In the same time, the agency develops an international activity: taking care of the construction of the Hotel Sofitel Water Tower in Chicago for Accor in 2002 and working in a draft new city in Malaysia. In spring 2008, in Budapest central square, the Vorosmarty Plaza Project was opened to the public: a mixed building dressed in a glass envelope. In June 2008, the McNay Museum of Art in San Antonio, the first American modern art museum built by a French architect, was inaugurated. The agency also worked in Morocco at the construction of the headquarters of Morocco Telecom in Rabat in 2009.

Early life Edger was born in 1857 at Abingdon, Berkshire, England. Her family emigrated from England to New Zealand in 1862. She and her sisters received much of their early education from their father. They lived in Albertland and then in Auckland, and as there was no higher education for girls at the time, but she showed academic promise, she was placed in the top class of the Auckland College and Grammar School. On 11 July 1877 she graduated from the University of New Zealand with a BA in Mathematics and Latin. When Kate applied to the senate of the University of New Zealand for permission to sit for a university scholarship she did not state her gender and her application was successful. She was the only female in classes at Auckland College and Grammar School, which was affiliated to the University of New Zealand (Auckland University College was yet to be established.) She graduated in 1877 with a Bachelor of Arts (specialising in mathematics and Latin) from the University of New Zealand. Her qualification was lauded and 1,000 people came to cheer as the Bishop awarded her with a camellia to symbolise her modesty and her achievement. She and her sister, Lilian, both went on to obtain master's degrees. Edger was the founding principal of Nelson College for Girls in 1883. She created drills for the girls. She married in 1890 and said that she would work on however she later resigned. This is thought to be due to her pregnancy with her first child. Family Kate Edger was a daughter of the Rev. Samuel Edger, a Christian minister who brought his family from England with the Albertland settlers to New Zealand in 1862. A university graduate himself, he supported Kate and her sister Lilian in their efforts to gain higher education. Kate married in 1890 and supported her husband, William, who did charitable works by running a private school. Edger's sister Gertrude had a daughter, Geraldine Hemus, who became the third woman in New Zealand to be admitted to practice law as a barrister and solicitor. Legacy Tennis at the Ladies‚Äô College (now Nelson College for Girls) in 1889 (15807860119) The Kate Edger Educational Charitable Trust provides financial assistance for women pursuing undergraduate or postgraduate degrees. In 2004 the Kate Edger Information Commons was created at The University of Auckland. In 2017, Kate Edger was chosen as one of the Royal Society of New Zealand's \\"150 Women in 150 Words\\" project. In September 2018, the Department of Mathematics at the University of Auckland was temporarily renamed to the \\"Kate Edgar Department of Mathematics\\" to mark the 125th anniversary of women's suffrage in New Zealand.

Cochise County was carved off in 1881 from the easternmost portion of Pima County during a formative period in the American Southwest. The era was characterized by rapidly growing boomtowns, the emergence of large-scale farming and ranching interests, lucrative mining operations, and the development of new technologies in railroading and telecommunications. Complicating the situation was staunch resistance to white settlement from local Native American groups, most notably during the Apache Wars, as well as Cochise County's location on the border with Mexico, which not only threatened international conflict but also presented opportunities for criminal smugglers and cattle rustlers. Factional hostilities emerged as soon as American settlers began arriving in southern Arizona in large numbers in the 1860s and 1870s. The Gadsden Purchase of 1853 had opened the territory to Americans, and the sudden growth of settlement and investment proved a source of great enmity between local Apaches and the American newcomers. Pima County and later Cochise County were the primary battleground for most of the resulting quarter-century of warfare, which was almost constant in the region until the late 1880s. In addition to the Native American conflicts, there was also considerable tension between rural residents of Cochise County, who were for the most part Democrats from the agrarian Confederate States, and more urban residents living within the region's few developed towns, who were largely Republican business owners from the industrial Union States. The division created polarizing sectional alliances and culminated in countless local feuds, the most well-known of which has been called the Cochise County feud or the Earp‚ÄìClanton feud, which included the historic Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in the town of Tombstone and Wyatt Earp's Vendetta Ride in the early 1880s. Dr. George E. Goodfellow famously described Tombstone, the capital of Cochise County, as the \\"condensation of wickedness.\\"  Formation of Cochise County  The land that now comprises Cochise County, along with the rest of modern Arizona south of the Gila River and a small part of southwestern New Mexico, was Mexican territory until 1853, when it was purchased by the United States in the Gadsden Purchase. Cochise County was created on February 1, 1881 from the eastern portion of Pima County. It was named after the legendary Chiricahua Apache war chief Cochise, who was a pivotal figure in the Apache Wars before his death in 1874. The county seat was Tombstone until 1929, when it moved to Bisbee. Cochise County is almost a perfect square in the southeasternmost corner of the state: . It covers a land area of ‚Äì1.5 times the size of the state of Connecticut‚Äìand shares an border with the Mexican state of Sonora. The county also includes of the San Pedro River watershed. Most of Cochise County is dominated by basin and range topography, with high- altitude rocky plateaus and forested mountain ranges (including the Dragoon Mountains and the Chiricahua Mountains) separated by broad, low-lying valleys of Sonoran Desert scrub. Dragoon Summit divides the county.  Apache Wars  A pile of stones in Skeleton Canyon marking the site of Geronimo's surrender in 1886 The Apache Wars were Arizona's and New Mexico's most prominent conflict for more than 30 years in the latter half of the 19th century, as well as one of the lengthiest conflicts in all of the Indian Wars. The land that is now Cochise County is located in the ancestral homeland of the Chiricahua Apache, who fiercely resisted American encroachment on their territory for decades. The Chiricahua War began as the American Civil War was beginning, when the southern part of New Mexico Territory (of which present- day Arizona was a part) had nominally joined the Confederate States of America as Confederate Arizona and both Union and Confederate armies vied for control of New Mexico and the important emigrant trail and stagecoach route passing through the area en route to California.  Cochise and the Bascom Affair  In January 1861, a band of Apaches raided the ranch of John Ward, stole some livestock, and kidnapped the son of a Mexican woman who lived with Ward. Ward wrongly believed that the unrelated Chiricahua Apache chief Cochise and his followers were responsible and he demanded that the United States Army confront Cochise, recover the livestock, and rescue the boy. A month later, the army responded by sending Lieutenant George Nicholas Bascom and fifty-four men into Apache Pass, where several people had been massacred by the Chiricahuas in the past. After setting up camp about a mile from a Butterfield Overland Mail waystation, Bascom lured Cochise and several of his relatives into his tent and threatened to hold him hostage until Ward's property and the boy were returned. Furious and insulted, Cochise cut through the wall of the tent, eluded the guards posted outside, and attempted to free the other hostages by offering to exchange them for several of his own prisoners. When Bascom refused, the Chiricahuas killed their prisoners, and Bascom responded by hanging Cochise's hostage relatives. The incident triggered a series of retaliations that soon erupted into full-scale war across a vast portion of southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. The fighting did not come to any significant end until 1886, when the Apache shaman Geronimo surrendered to the U.S. Army at Skeleton Canyon. But even after Geronimo's surrender, warriors like Massai and the Apache Kid continued to raid settlers' ranches for years into the 20th century.  Battle of Apache Pass  Between 1861 and 1886, there were dozens of skirmishes between white soldiers or settlers and Apaches in Cochise County. The biggest of these battles occurred when Cochise and Mangas Coloradas attempted to ambush a detachment of the California Column as it made its way east through Apache Pass in the Chiricahua Mountains. During the ensuing Battle of Apache Pass, on June 15, 1862, Captain Thomas L. Roberts and 126 men routed 500 Apaches from their fortified positions overlooking the area. Sixty-six Apaches were killed while the Americans suffered only five casualties. The army then built Fort Bowie to protect the trail that led through the pass.  Conflicts and feuds = Rural vs. town interests  Many of the ranchers and Cowboys who lived in the Cochise County countryside were resentful of the growing power of the business owners and townspeople who increasingly influenced local politics and law in the county. A cowboy in that time and region was generally regarded as an outlaw. Legitimate cowmen were referred to as cattle herders or ranchers. The ranchers largely maintained control of the country around Tombstone, due in large part to the sympathetic support of Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan who favored the Cowboys and rural ranchers and who grew to intensely dislike the Earps. Behan tended to ignore the Earp's complaints about the McLaury's and Clanton's horse thieving and cattle rustling. The townspeople and business owners welcomed the Cowboys who had money to spend in the numerous bordellos, gambling halls, and drinking establishments. When lawlessness got out of hand, they enacted ordinances to control the disruptive revelry and shootings. As officers of the law, the Earp brothers held authority at times on the federal, county and local level. They were resented by the Cowboys for their tactics as when Wyatt Earp buffaloed Curly Bill when he accidentally shot Marshal Fred White. The Earps were also known to bend the law in their favor when it affected their gambling and saloon interests, which earned them further enmity with the Cowboy faction. Under the surface were other tensions aggravating the simmering distrust. Most of the leading cattlemen and Cowboys were Confederate sympathizers and Democrats from Southern states, especially Missouri and Texas. The mine and business owners, miners, townspeople and city lawmen including the Earps were largely Republicans from the Northern states. There was also the fundamental conflict over resources and land, of traditional, Southern-style \\"small government\\" agrarianism of the rural Cowboys with Northern-style industrial capitalism.  Lawmen vs. outlaws  During the rapid growth of Cochise County in the 1880s at the peak of the silver mining boom, outlaws derisively called \\"Cowboys\\" frequently robbed stagecoaches and brazenly stole cattle in broad daylight, scaring off the legitimate cowboys watching the herds. It became an insult to call a legitimate cattleman a \\"Cowboy.\\" Legal cowmen were generally called herders or ranchers. The lines between the outlaw element and law enforcement were not always distinct. Doc Holliday had a reputation as a killer, though modern research has only identified three individuals he shot. He was also friends with Bill Leonard, who was implicated in a stagecoach robbery. Cowboy Frank Stilwell was a known cattle rustler and served as an assistant Sheriff under Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan. Cowboy and outlaw Texas Jack Vermillion was a friend of the Earps who deputized him after Virgil Earp was maimed in an ambush.  Murder of Deputies Adams and Finley  At the behest of Judge Charles Silent, Territorial Marshal Crawley Dake deputized John H. Adams and Cornelius Finley. While traveling north to company headquarters in September 1878, less than two weeks after they were deputized, five Mexicans intercepted Adams and Finley, who they believed were carrying gold ore, and killed them. They failed to find any ore however. One of the suspects in the killings was Florentino Saiz, who the Arizona Weekly Star identified as \\"the 1878 murderer of Deputy U.S. Marshals Cornelius Finley and John Hicks Adams on September 2, 1878\\". During the Coroner's Inquest into the death of Morgan Earp, Pete Spence's wife, Marietta Duarte, implicated her husband and four other men, including Florentino Cruz, in Morgan's murder. Saiz and Cruz may have been the same person.ODMP U.S. Deputy Marshals Finley In 1879, the Mexican federal government refused to allow Dake to extradite two of the suspects. Unable to find justice in the courts for his brother's murder, Wyatt Earp began a vendetta, and killed Florentino Cruz on March 22, 1882 at a wood camp near South Pass of the Dragoon Mountains.  Smuggling and cattle rustling  From early in the history of Pima County, bandits used the border between the United States and Mexico to raid across in one direction and use the other as sanctuary. In December, 1878, and again the next year, Mexican authorities complained about American outlaw Cowboys who stole Mexican beef and resold it in Arizona. The Arizona Citizen reported that both U.S. and Mexican bandits were stealing horses from the Santa Cruz Valley and selling the livestock in Sonora, Mexico. Arizona Territorial Governor Fremont investigated the Mexican government's allegations and accused them in turn of allowing outlaws to use Sonora as a base of operations for raiding into Arizona. The Clanton and McLaury clans were among those allegedly involved in the clandestine cross- border livestock smuggling from Sonora into Arizona. The illegal cattle operations kept beef prices lower and provided cheap stock that helped small ranchers get by. Many early Tombstone residents looked the other way when it was \\"only Mexicans\\" being robbed. Newman Haynes Clanton c. 1880 The Clanton family led by Newman Haynes Clanton had a ranch about southeast of Tombstone that was a way station for stolen Mexican beef. He was assisted by his sons Ike, Billy, and Phin Clanton. Frank and Tom McLaury had a ranch outside of Tombstone that they used to buy and re-sell stolen Mexican cattle. On July 25, 1880, Captain Joseph H. Hurst requested the assistance of Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp, who brought Wyatt and Morgan Earp, as well as Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams, to track the thieves of six U.S. Army mules stolen from Camp Rucker. This was a federal matter because the animals were U.S. property. They found the animals on the McLaury's Ranch on the Babacomari River and the branding iron used to change the \\"US\\" brand to \\"D8\\". To avoid bloodshed, Cowboy Frank Patterson promised to return the mules so the posse withdrew. The Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules and laughed at Captain Hurst and the Earps. Hurst responded by printing and distributing a handbill describing the theft and promising a reward for the \\"trial and conviction\\" of the thieves. He specifically charged Frank McLaury with assisting with the theft. It was reprinted in the Epitaph on July 30, 1880. Frank McLaury angrily printed a response in the Cowboy-friendly Nuggett, calling Hurst \\"a coward, a vagabond, a rascal, and a malicious liar.\\" In late 1879 one of Wyatt Earp's prized horses named Dick Naylor was stolen. Almost a year later he got a tip that it had been seen at the Clanton ranch near Charleston. Earp rode out to their ranch and spotted the horse. Ike Clanton and his brother Billy were both present. Earp returned with Holliday to recover the horse. On the way, they overtook Behan, who was riding in a wagon. Behan was also heading to the ranch to serve an election-hearing subpoena on Ike Clanton.  Pleasant Valley War  At the start of the Pleasant Valley War, a notorious feud that took place in Arizona's Tonto Basin from 1882 to 1892, the smuggler Neil McLeod left Globe, Arizona for Cochise County. Many Cochise County cattle dealers were losing cattle and horses to thieves that T. W. Ayles described as an \\"organized band\\" whose \\"connections seem to extend to and over the Mexican border.\\" In the middle of 1881, the Mexican military dropped taxes on alcohol and tobacco and began vigorously pursuing the Cowboys. In response, the rustlers increased their stock thefts on the U.S. side of the border. McLeod used boxing matches and wrestling as a cover for his less scrupulous activities of rustling and selling contraband near the Mexican border. Prizefighting had become quite sophisticated in Tombstone and in October 1883 McLeod beat the then champion Young in four rounds and was awarded a $400 prize. McLeod also maintained good relations with Judge Aaron H. Hackney in Globe by helping the judge's friends caught in the feud, including Frederick Russell Burnham, leave the Tonto Basin to hide out in Tombstone. In August 1884, McLeod was assassinated in Nacosair, Sonora, Mexico by James Powers.  First Skeleton Canyon Massacre  Skeleton Canyon is located in the Peloncillo Mountains, which straddles the modern Arizona and New Mexico state border. This canyon connects the Animas Valley of New Mexico with the San Simon Valley of Arizona. The first Skeleton Canyon massacres was an attack on Mexican Rurales by rustlers in July 1879. They attacked a rancho in northern Sonora, killing several of the inhabitants. After the attack on the rancho, the survivors reported the attacks to Commandant Francisco Neri and he sent a detachment of Rurales out, among them Captain Alfredo Carrillo. The Rurales illegally crossed the border into Arizona and as the Rurales entered in the canyon, shots were fired. Three of the Rurales survived the initial onslaught. Then the Cowboys executed the Rurales leader. The Mexican Government protested the killings to President Chester Arthur despite the fact that the Mexican policemen had crossed into a foreign country where they had no jurisdiction. Although the assailants were never positively identified, it was speculated that Old Man Clanton, Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, \\"Curly Bill\\" Brocius, Johnny Ringo, and Florentino Cruz were the murderers.  Governor Fremont asks for militia  Territorial Governor John C. Fr√©mont, who had been the first Republican presidential candidate in 1856, was largely an absentee appointee. But in February 1881 he suggested to the territorial legislature that they fund a state militia to ride against the outlaws and stop the rustling. The legislators hooted down his plan.  Second Skeleton Canyon Massacre  In July 1881, \\"Curly Bill\\" Brocius received word that several Mexican smugglers carrying silver were heading to the United States through Skeleton Canyon. Johnny Ringo reported that Curly Bill and several other men including Old Man Clanton, Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, Tom McLaury, Billy Grounds, and Zwing Hunt hid in the rocks high above the trail. As the smugglers rode through the canyon the murderers opened fire, killing six of the nineteen. The rest were killed as they tried to get away.  Guadalupe Canyon Massacre  In August 1881, Mexican Commandant Felipe Neri dispatched troops to the border. Some researchers theorize that Mexican Rurales led by Captain Alfredo Carrillo, who had survived the Skeleton Canyon Massacre in 1879, led the ambush of the Cowboys. They found \\"Old Man\\" Clanton and six others bedded down for the night in Guadalupe Canyon with a herd of cattle. The Mexicans waited until dawn and killed five of the Cowboys. The dead included Old Man Clanton; Charley Snow, a ranch hand who thought he had heard a bear and was the first killed; Jim Crain, who was wanted for the stagecoach robbery near Tombstone during which Bud Philpott had been murdered; Dick Gray, son of Col. Mike Gray; and Billy Lang, a cattle rancher. Clanton, Crain, and Gray were either still in their bedrolls or in the act of getting dressed when killed. Lang was the only one who had a chance to fight back. Harry Ernshaw, a milk farmer, was grazed by a bullet on the nose; Billy Byers feigned death until the soldiers left.  Tombstone marshal killed  On October 28, 1880, Tombstone town marshal Fred White was trying to break up a group of late revelers shooting at the moon on Allen Street in Tombstone. He attempted to confiscate the pistol of Curly Bill Brocius and was shot in the abdomen. Wyatt Earp buffaloed Brocius, knocking him unconscious, and arrested him. Wyatt told his biographer many years later that he thought Brocius was still armed at the time and had not noticed that Brocius' pistol was already on the ground. The pistol contained only one expended cartridge and five live rounds. Brocius waived a preliminary hearing so he and his case could be transferred to Tucson District Court. White died two days after his shooting, changing Brocius' charge to murder. On December 27, 1880, Wyatt testified that he thought the shooting was accidental. It was also demonstrated that Brocius' pistol could be fired from half-cock. Fred White also left a statement before he died that the shooting was not intentional. The judge released Brocius, but Brocius retained bitterness towards Earp for the rough treatment he got when arrested.  Elections and ballot-stuffing  Democrat Charles A. Shibell Republican Bob Paul Pima County sheriff Democrat Charles A. Shibell appointed Wyatt Earp as a Pima County Deputy Sheriff on July 27, 1880. Wyatt did his job well, and from August through November his name was mentioned nearly every week by the Epitaph or the Nugget newspapers.  Pima County sheriff  Shibell ran for reelection in the November 2, 1880, against Republican Bob Paul. The region was strongly Republican and Paul was expected to win. Whoever won would likely appoint someone from the same political party. Republican Wyatt expected he would continue in the job. Johnny Ringo attended the Democratic party convention in Pima County and got himself elected as a delegate for San Simon/Cienega Precinct 27, located in San Simon Valley in northern Cochise County. This was despite the fact he'd shot Louis Hancock, the brother in law to James Hayes, a member of the Committee of Credentials, only a few months before. He persuaded the Pima County Board of Supervisors to make the house of rustling buddy Joe Hill the polling place and himself and Ike Clanton as election officials. But when the supervisors learned that Joe Hill had already moved, they moved the polling place to the home of John Magill and removed Johnny Ringo and Ike Clanton as election officials, but it was too late. On the day of the election in Precinct 27‚ÄîSan Simon Valley in northern Cochise County‚ÄîJames C. Hancock reported that Cowboys Curly Bill Brocius and Ringo served as election officials in the San Simon precinct. However, on June 1, the day before the election, Ringo biographer David Johnson places Ringo in New Mexico with Ike Clanton. Curly Bill had been arrested and jailed in Tucson on October 28 for killing Sheriff Fred White and he was still there on election day. The home of John Magill was used as the polling place. A mysterious \\"Henry Johnson\\" was responsible for certifying the ballots. This turned out to be James Johnson, the same James K. Johnson who had been shooting up Allen Street the night Marshal White was killed. Moreover, he was the same Johnson that testified at Curly Bill's preliminary hearing after he shot Fred White. James Johnson later testified for Bud Paul in the election hearing and said that the ballots had been left in the care of Phin Clanton. None of the witnesses during the election hearing reported on ballots being cast for dogs. They gathered the dozen or so legal voters in town and coerced them to vote for Shibell. Then they gathered non-voters like the children and Chinese and had them cast ballots. Not satisfied, the named all the dogs, burros and poultry and cast ballots in their names for Shibell. The San Simon precinct turned out an amazing 104 votes, 103 of them for Shibell. Democrat Shibell was unexpectedly reelected by a margin of 58 votes. He immediately appointed Johnny Behan as the new deputy sheriff for the Tombstone region of Pima County. Wyatt, also a Republican, supported Paul and resigned as deputy sheriff on November 9. Shibell immediately appointed Behan as the new South Pima deputy sheriff. Paul and Earp checked the ballots and were suspicious to see that 108 out of 109 voters in Precinct 27 had voted for Shibell. On November 19, Paul filed suit and accused Shibell of ballot-stuffing. The trial was transferred to Tucson's district court and began on January 17. On January 20, 1881, the Arizona Star reported, ‚ÄúThere has been some big cheating somewhere, and by some persons. It was clear that there had been reckless counting at Tombstone, fraud at San Simon and a careless election board at Tres Alamos.‚Äù A recount was held and this time Paul had 402 votes and Shibell had 354. Judge Judge C.G.W. French ruled in Paul's favor in late January, 1881, throwing the whole precinct out, but Shibell appealed, preventing Paul from taking office until April 1881. However, the eastern portion of Pima County had been split off to form Cochise County on February 1. This prevented Paul from appointing Earp as deputy sheriff for the Tombstone area of Pima County.  Cochise County sheriff  When Cochise County was initially formed, both Wyatt Earp and Johnny Behan sought the new sheriff's position. It was a lucrative job, far beyond its salary. The sheriff was not only responsible for enforcing the law but was also county assessor, tax collector, and responsible for collecting prostitution, gambling, liquor, and theater fees. The county supervisors allowed the sheriff to keep ten percent of all amounts paid. This made the job worth more than $40,000 a year (about $ today). Democrat Johnny Behan had considerably more political experience than Republican Wyatt Earp. Behan had previously served as Yavapai County Sheriff from 1871 to 1873. He had been elected to the Arizona Territorial Legislature twice, representing Yavapai Country in the 7th Territorial Legislature in 1873 and Mohave County in the 10th in 1879. Behan moved for a time to the northwest Arizona Territory where he served as the Mohave County Recorder in 1877 and then deputy sheriff of Mohave County at Gillet, in 1879. Furthermore, Behan's partner in the Dexter Livery, John Dunbar, had a brother Thomas who served in the Arizona Territorial Legislature. Thomas Dunbar introduced the bill that split Cochise County off from Pima County in the far southeast corner of the territory, and he became known as the ‚Äúfather of Cochise County‚Äù. The Dunbar family in their home town of Bangor, Maine, were \\"close family friends\\" of the powerful Senator James G. Blaine, also from Bangor, and one of the most powerful Republican congressmen of his time. The Dunbars used their influence to help Behan get appointed Sheriff of the new Cochise County, in February 1881. Behan utilized his existing position and his superior political connections to lobby hard for the position. The office was appointed by the Territorial governor and confirmed by the territorial legislature. Wyatt also had other interests including a claim in the Vizina mine, water rights proposals, and a one-quarter interest in the Oriental Hotel where the ran the Faro concession at the Oriental Saloon. Behan made a deal with Earp: he promised Wyatt a position as his undersheriff if he was appointed over Wyatt. Earp withdrew his name from the political contest. Behan used the influence Behan had previously served as Yavapai County Sheriff from 1871 to 1873. He had been elected to the Arizona Territorial Legislature twice, representing Yavapai Country in the 7th Territorial Legislature in 1873 and Mohave County in the 10th in 1879. Behan moved for a time to the northwest Arizona Territory where he served as the Mohave County Recorder in 1877 and then deputy sheriff of Mohave County at Gillet, in 1879. When Cochise County was formed, Governor John C. Fr√©mont appointed and the Territorial Legislature approved Behan as Sheriff and John Dunbar as the first Cochise County Treasurer on February 10, 1881. Behan reneged on his deal with Earp and appointed prominent Democrat Harry Woods instead. Later that year, Behan gave a contrived explanation of his actions during the hearings after the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. He said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because of an incident shortly before his appointment. Searching for a horse stolen in late 1879, Wyatt learned about a year later that the horse was in nearby Charleston. Wyatt spotted Billy Clanton attempting to remove the horse from a corral and retrieved it without trouble. Behan was in the area to serve a subpoena on Ike Clanton. Ike was hopping mad when Behan finally found him, for Earp had told Clanton that Behan \\"had taken a posse of nine men down there to arrest him.\\" Behan took offense at Wyatt's tactics and changed his mind about appointing Wyatt. Holliday reported in an interview in 1882 that \\"from that time a coolness grew up between the two men.\\"  Virgil Earp loses election  Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp ran against Ben Sippy, a part-time policeman, for the job of Tombstone City Marshal. Sippy ran ads in the Democrat and Cowboy-loyal Nuggett, but Virgil didn't get the support he expected from John Clum and the Republican The Epitaph. To Virgil's surprise, he lost, by a margin of 311‚Äì259.  Notable shootouts  On April 6, 1880, only two months after he arrived, Tombstone resident George Parsons wrote in his diary, \\"Several more shooting scrapes but they are of such frequent occurrence that their novelty has ceased.\\" Cochise County became well known for the dozens of shootings and public gunfights between Old West lawmen and outlaws that occurred within its boundaries.  Gunfight at the O.K. Corral  Tombstone, Arizona in 1891 On October 26, 1881, town marshal and Deputy U. S. Marshall Virgil Earp led his brothers and deputies Wyatt and James along with Doc Holliday in a confrontation with five outlaw Cowboys: Wesley Fuller, Tom and Frank McLaury, Billy Claiborne and Ike Clanton. The Cowboys were armed in violation of a city ordinance prohibiting carrying weapons in town. This shootout became famous as the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Wes Fuller, Ike Clanton, and Billy Claiborne ran from the fight unharmed, but Billy Clanton and both McLaury brothers were killed. It took place at about 3:00 pm on October 26, 1881, in Tombstone, Arizona Territory of the United States. Although only three men were killed during the gunfight, it is generally regarded as the most famous gunfight in the history of the Old West. Despite its name, the gunfight began in a wide empty lot or alley on Fremont Street, between C. S. Fly's lodging house and photographic studio and the MacDonald assay house. The lot was six doors east of an alleyway that served as the O.K. Corral's rear entrance. The two opposing parties were initially only about apart. About thirty shots were fired in thirty seconds. Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne ran from the fight, unharmed. Frank and Tom McLaury and Billy Clanton were killed; Morgan Earp, Virgil Earp, and Doc Holliday were wounded and survived. Ike Clanton filed murder charges against Doc Holliday and the Earps and after a month-long preliminary hearing they were exonerated. The Earps and Doc Holliday were charged by Billy Clanton's brother, Ike Clanton, with murder but were eventually exonerated by a local judge after a 30-day preliminary hearing and then again by a local grand jury. The so-called cowboy faction allegedly targeted the Earps for assassination over the next six months, which led to a series of killings and retributions, often with federal and county lawmen supporting different sides of the conflict. The series of battles became known as the Earp Vendetta Ride. The Earps and Doc Holliday left Arizona and the Cowboy element was less of a threat from that point forward.  Death of jealous husband  In mid-June 1880, \\"Buckskin\\" Frank Leslie who had an eye for the ladies, escorted Mary Killen, the Commercial Hotel's housekeeper, to a dance. Accounts differ as to whether she was separated from her husband or still married to him. After the dance, they sat on the porch of the Cosmopolitan Hotel and were spotted by her drunken husband. Killen appeared out of the dark street and shot at Leslie, barely missing him. Leslie fired back and shot Mike Killen twice. Mike Killen died five days later and was buried in Tombstone's Boot Hill cemetery on June 22, 1880. Buckskin Frank Leslie had fired in self-defense and wasn't arrested.  Murder of Henry Schneider  On January 14, 1881, gambler Michael O'Rourke (aka Johnny Behind the Deuce) got into a disagreement with Henry Schneider chief engineer of the Tombstone Mining and Milling Company, at a restaurant during lunch. According to the Epitaph, Schneider suspected O'Rourke had stolen several articles of clothing from Schneider's cabin, but could not prove it. The next day Schneider went to lunch and he and O'Rourke got into a disagreement. According to O'Rourke and two friends of his, Schneider produced a knife and O'Rourke shot him in self-defense. Another stated that O'Rourke took offense at something Schneider said and threatened him, saying, \\"Goddamn you, I'll shoot you when you come out.\\" He waited for Schneider outside and killed him‚ÄîO'Rourke said in self-defense. Charleston's constable George McKelvey arrested O'Rourke. Henry was well-liked and a mob of miners quickly gathered, threatening to lynch O'Rourke on the spot. McKelvey took O'Rourke on a buckboard wagon to Tombstone and the mob followed. Once in Tombstone, Tombstone Marshal Ben Sippy, with the assistance of Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp, Assistant City Marshal Morgan Earp, and former Pima County Sheriff Wyatt Earp held the crowd at bay until calm prevailed.  Luke Short kills Charlie Storms  In February 1881, Luke Short and professional gambler and gunfighter Charlie Storms had a verbal altercation about a faro game which was defused by Bat Masterson, who knew both men. On February 28, Storm confronted Short once again outside the Oriental Saloon. This time he pulled a .45 caliber revolver. But Storm was too slow and Short shot him in the chest at point-blank range, his muzzle flash setting Storms' clothes on fire. Short shot Storms again before his body hit the ground. George Parsons witnessed Storms' death and wrote in his journal, \\"The faro games went right on as though nothing had happened.\\" Short was arrested but the shooting was ruled as self defense. Short left Tombstone in April and returned to Leadville, Colorado. The Tombstone Daily Journal asked in March 1881 how a hundred outlaws could terrorize the best system of government in the world, asking, \\"Can not the marshal summon a posse and throw the ruffians out?\\"  Billy Claiborne shoots James Hickey  In Charleston on October 1, 1881, James Hickey was drunk. He taunted Billy Claiborne, following him around, daring him to fight. Billy avoided Hickey and left Ben Wood's Saloon for J.B. Ayer's Saloon across the street. Hickey followed right behind, hectoring Claiborne. Claiborne left once again because of Hickey and headed toward Harry Queen's Saloon. Hickey stopped him before he could enter Harry Queen's. Claiborne yelled, \\"Stay away from me!\\" and drew his revolver. He shot Hickey once between the eyes. Claiborne was arrested and stood trial but was acquitted because of Hickey's harassment.  Frank Leslie kills Billy Claiborne  On November 14, 1882, Frank Leslie became involved in an argument with Billy Claiborne who, after the recent death of William Bonney, had demanded to be known as \\"Billy the Kid\\". Claiborne claimed he had killed three men who had ridiculed him, although there is only evidence of Claiborne 's fight with Bill Hickey. But he had run from the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, and his reputation suffered as a result. On this late night, Claiborne threatened Leslie. When Leslie still refused to refer to him as \\"Billy the Kid\\", Claiborne left, only to return later that night. A patron told Leslie that Claiborne was waiting for him outside the Oriental Saloon. Leslie walked out a side door and when Claiborne shot at him, he shot back, killing him. Because Claiborne was waiting outside to ambush Leslie and fired first, the killing was ruled justified. It was described as \\"an incident that became an open-and- closed affair over the short period of time required by Frank to puff through a rolled cylinder of Bull Durham.\\"  Lester Moore \\"no more\\"  One of the most well-known headstones in Tombstone's Boot Hill cemetery belongs to Lester Moore. He was a Wells, Fargo & Co. station agent in the Mexican border at Naco, Arizona Territory. One afternoon Hank Dunstan appeared to claim a package due him. When he got it, he found it thoroughly mangled. The two men argued, and then both Moore and Dunstan drew their weapons. Dunstan got off four shots, hitting Moore in the chest with his .44 caliber revolver. Dunstan was mortally wounded with a hole through his ribs by the single shot Moore had squeezed off. Les Moore was buried in Boot Hill and his famous tombstone epitaph remains an attraction in the cemetery: : HERE LIES LESTER MOORE, FOUR SLUGS FROM A 44, NO LES NO MORE  Sheriff Slaughter vs. Jack Taylor Gang  John Horton Slaughter with his shotgun In 1886, John Horton Slaughter was elected Cochise County sheriff. Four members of the Jack Taylor Gang‚ÄîManuel Robles, Geronimo Miranda, Fred Federico, and Nieves Deron‚Äîwere wanted by both the Mexican Rurales and Arizona law enforcement for robbery and murder. Trying to evade the lawmen's pursuit, the men came to Tombstone to visit relatives. Slaughter heard that the men were nearby and rode out to arrest them, but the outlaws were tipped off and fled. Slaughter eventually learned they were hiding with Robles' brother in nearby Contention City. Slaughter raised a posse and raided the house. They surprised Robles and Deron while they were asleep, but the gang members rose shooting. Slaughter killed Robles' brother while Deron and Robles ran for cover. Shooting as he ran, Deron nicked Slaughter's right ear lobe. Slaughter shot back and mortally wounded Deron. In his dying minutes, Deron confessed he was guilty of the crimes he had been charged with. Robles got away but he and Miranda were later shot and killed by Mexican authorities.  Robberies and murders  Between 1877 and 1882, bandits robbed 36 stagecoaches in the southern portion of the territory. While his election as sheriff was being contested, Bob Paul worked as a Wells Fargo shotgun messenger. On March 15, 1881, at 10 p.m., three cowboys attempted to rob a Kinnear & Company stagecoach carrying US$26,000 in silver bullion (or about $ in today's dollars) en route from Tombstone to Benson, Arizona, the nearest rail terminal. Eli \\"Budd\\" Philpot, a popular driver, had been handling the reins but felt ill and switched giving Paul the driver's seat in Contention City. Near Drew's Station, just outside Contention City, a man stepped into the road and commanded them to \\"Hold!\\" Paul fired his shotgun and emptied his revolver at the robbers, wounding a Cowboy later identified as Bill Leonard in the groin. They returned fire, killing Philpot, sitting in Bob Paul's place. Paul urged the horses forward and the Cowboys fired again, killing Peter Roerig, a beer salesman for Anheuser Busch riding in the rear dickey seat. The horses spooked and Paul wasn't able to bring the stage under control for almost a mile, leaving the robbers with nothing. Paul later said he thought the first shot killing Philpot in the shotgun messenger seat had been meant for him as he would normally have been seated there. Billy Breakenridge Paul sent a telegram from nearby Benson to Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp. When Virgil received it at 10:00 pm, he deputized Wyatt and Morgan Earp, Bat Masterson, who was dealing faro at the Oriental Saloon, and Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams. Pima County Sheriff Behan and Deputy Sheriff Billy Breakinridge joined in. They arrived at Drew's Station around dawn. Behan tried to talk them out of following the murders. The Earps were skilled trackers and Masterson could read sign like an Indian. Virgil insisted they pursue the killers and told Behan he could ride along or ride back to Tombstone. Behan indifferently agreed to stay, and they tracked three pairs of boots to a nearby hiding spot where the outlaws mounted their horses, accompanied by a fourth rider. Bob Paul thought he recognized the voices of Bill Leonard and Jim Crain. Wyatt had seen Cowboys who worked for the Clantons‚ÄîBill Leonard, Harry \\"The Kid\\" Head, Jim Crain and a drifter named Luther King‚Äîcamped out in an old adobe along the stage route for the past week, and he suspected they were watching the stage for an opportunity to rob it. The lines between the outlaw element and law enforcement were not always distinct. Doc Holliday had a reputation as a killer, though modern research has only identified three individuals he shot. He was friends with Bill Leonard, who was implicated in a stagecoach robbery. The Earp posse followed the robbers' trail to a nearby ranch where they found King. He wouldn't tell who his confederates were until the posse lied and told him that Holliday's girlfriend Big Nose Kate had been shot in the holdup. Fearful of Holliday's reputation, he confessed to holding the reins of the robbers' horses, and identified Leonard, Head, and Crain as the robbers. They were all known Cowboys and rustlers. Behan, Breakinridge, and Williams escorted King back to Tombstone.  Posse tracks robbers  On March 19, King was escorted in the front door of the jail and let out the back a few minutes later. King had arranged with Undersheriff Harry Woods (publisher of the Nuggett) to sell the horse he had been riding to John Dunbar, Sheriff Behan's partner in the Dexter Livery Stable. King conveniently escaped while Dunbar and Woods were making out the bill-of-sale. Woods claimed that someone had deliberately unlocked a secured back door to the jail. The Earps and the townspeople were furious at King's easy escape. Williams was later dismissed from Wells Fargo, leaving behind a number of debts, when it was determined he had been stealing from the company for years. The Earps, Bob Paul, and others pursued the other two men for 17 days, riding at one point for 60 hours without food and 36 hours without water. The Cowboys were able to trade in their horses for fresh stock from friendly ranchers along the way. The lawmen were not so fortunate. During the ride Paul's horse died and Wyatt and Morgan's horses became so weak that the two men walked back to Tombstone to obtain new horses. After pursuing the Cowboys for over in a grand circle that finally led them into New Mexico, they could not obtain more fresh horses and were forced to give up the chase. They returned to Tombstone on April 1 to find that King had escaped. Wyatt accused Behan of complicity in King's escape, a charge that Behan strongly denied. Behan submitted a bill for $796.84 to the county for posse expenses, but he refused to reimburse the Earp's for any of their costs. Virgil was incensed. They were finally reimbursed by Wells, Fargo & Co. later on, but King's easy escape and Behan's refusal to reimburse them caused further friction between county and city law enforcement, and between Behan and the Earps.  Bisbee stagecoach robbery  Virgil Earp was appointed Tombstone's city marshal (chief of police) on June 6, 1881, after Ben Sippy abandoned the job. On September 8, 1881, tensions between the Earps and the McLaurys further increased when a passenger stage on the 'Sandy Bob Line' in the Tombstone area bound for Bisbee, Arizona was held up. The masked bandits robbed all of the passengers of their valuables and the strongbox of about $2,500. During the robbery, the driver heard one of the robbers describe the money as \\"sugar\\", a phrase known to be used by Frank Stilwell. Stilwell had until the prior month been a deputy for Sheriff Behan but had been fired for \\"accounting irregularities\\". Tom McLaury Frank Stilwell Both Pete Spence and Stilwell were friends of Tom and Frank McLaury. Wyatt and Virgil Earp rode with the sheriff's posse attempting to track the Bisbee stage robbers. At the scene of the holdup, Wells, Fargo & Co. undercover agent Fred Dodge discovered an unusual boot print left by someone wearing a custom-repaired boot heel. The Earps checked a shoe repair shop in Bisbee that had removed a heel matching the boot print from Frank Stilwell's boot. When Stilwell arrived in Bisbee with his livery stable partner, Pete Spence, Morgan and Wyatt Earp, Marshall Williams, agent of Wells Fargo & Co., and Deputy Sheriff William Breakenridge arrested them for the robbery. Stilwell and Spence were arraigned before Judge Wells Spicer and posted $7,000 bond. At the preliminary hearing, Stilwell and Spence were able to provide several witnesses who supported their alibis. Judge Spicer dropped the charges for insufficient evidence just as he had done for Doc Holliday earlier in the year. Having evaded the state charges, Virgil Earp in his other role as Deputy U.S. Marshal re-arrested Spence and Stilwell on October 13 for the Bisbee robbery on a new federal charge of interfering with a mail carrier. The newspapers, however, reported that they had been arrested for a different stage robbery that occurred (October 8) near Contention City. Virgil took Frank to Tucson for arraignment where he was held at the territorial jail. While Virgil was in Tucson, he deputized Wyatt to act in his place an assistant city marshal in Tombstone. The Cowboys saw the new arrest as further evidence they were being unfairly harassed and targeted by the Earps. They let the Earps know that they could expect retaliation. While Wyatt and Virgil were in Tucson for the federal hearing on the charges against Spence and Stilwell, Frank McLaury confronted Morgan Earp. He told him that the McLaurys would kill the Earps if they tried to arrest Spence, Stilwell, or the McLaurys again. The Tombstone Epitaph reported \\"that since the arrest of Spence and Stilwell, veiled threats [are] being made that the friends of the accused will 'get the Earps.'\\"  Prominent businessman murdered  Representing the danger of the Cowboys to business owners and citizens, on Saturday evening, March 25, 1881, chief engineer Martin R. Peel of the Tombstone Milling and Mining Company near Charleston was murdered by two masked men. They walked in on the mill superintendent, Peel, and two other men, who were socializing, with their rifles raised. Without saying a word, the first man fired a shot into Peel's chest, killing him instantly. Peel was shot through the heart at such close range that his clothing was set on fire. The second man fired a shot at W.L. Austin but he and the two other men ducked behind a counter and were not hit. No attempt at robbery was made and no motive could be immediately established. The assailants, who wore scarves over the faces, were believed to be Zwing Hunt and Billy Grounds, two well-known outlaws. Some people assumed they were planning a robbery but one fired his weapon accidentally. They were assisted by a third man who held their horses only a few hundred feet away. The crime sent reverberations through Tombstone and Cochise County. Peel's father, respected Judge Bryant L. Peel, sent an open letter to The Tombstone Epitaph stating that the citizens needed to take the law into their own hands. Within a few days, the suspects were reported at the Chandler Ranch, about from Tombstone. Sheriff Behan was out of town, so Deputy Sheriff Billy Breakenridge assembled a posse of five locals who arrived at the ranch before dawn on the morning of March 29\\\\. John Gillespie knocked on the door and was answered with a shot to the chest. Jack Young was shot through the thigh, and Hugh Allen was struck in the neck. Billy Grounds stepped into the doorway and Breakenridge shot him in the face with a shotgun, killing him. When Zwing Hunt stepped out from the side of the house, Breakenridge and Allen shot him in the chest. Hunt survived his wounds and soon escaped with the help of his brother, Hugh, who came over from Texas.  Spurned lover kills William Kinsman  On February 23, 1883, William Kinsman had been living with May Woodman. Apparently as a joke, someone had run a notice in the Epitaph newspaper that Kinsman intended to marry Woodman. Kinsman responded and ran his own announcement that he had no intentions of marrying May Woodman. Kinsman was standing in front of the Oriental Saloon on Allen Street when May Woodman walked up and shot him. Woodman was sentenced to five years in the Yuma Territorial Prison for killing Kinsman, although the acting governor pardoned her after she had served less than one year.  Bisbee Massacre  On December 8, 1883 in Bisbee, Arizona five outlaw Cowboys robbed the Goldwater & Castaneda Mercantile and killed four people. Six men were arrested and five of them were later convicted and executed on March 28, 1884 for the crime. They were the first criminals to be legally hanged in Tombstone, then the county seat.The Tombstone Epitaph 12 February 1884The Tombstone Republican. 16 February 1884 The sixth man, John Heath, who was accused of organizing the robbery, was tried separately and sentenced to life in prison. Unsatisfied with what they perceived as a lenient sentence, a Tombstone lynch mob forcibly removed him from jail and hanged him on February 22, 1884. Today, the graves of the five murderers are part of the popular tourist attraction at Boothill Graveyard in Tombstone.

Most of the tourists who visit Eswatini arrive by road from South Africa. Eswatini's tourism industry developed during the apartheid era in South Africa and this shaped many of its distinctive attractions. Since the end of apartheid, Eswatini has emphasized its traditional culture as a tourist attraction. Apartheid era The adoption of apartheid in South Africa and civil war in Mozambique contributed to Eswatini's appeal as an alternative tourist destination in Southern Africa. This led to growth in Eswatini's tourism industry from the 1960s to the 1990s. During the apartheid era in South Africa, Eswatini drew many visitors by adopting different policies than South Africa. Many tourists visited Eswatini during that time in order to watch television programs or sporting events that they could not view in South Africa. During apartheid in South Africa, Eswatini also legalized gambling in order to draw tourists what brought significant economic prosperity. Lake with hippos in the Mlilwane reserve The number of tourists visiting Eswatini increased from 89,015 in 1972 to 257,997 in 1989. In 1988 tourism was 3% of the GDP of Eswatini and more than 4% of its total exports. Although the traditional Monarchy of Eswatini has often been cited as a factor that attracts tourists, tourism has also been credited with causing modernization in Eswatini. Although the increases in tourism seen in Eswatini have been alleged to have caused an increase in prostitution, there is no evidence that prostitution was a factor in the growth of the Eswatini tourism industry. The increase in tourism did cause the centers of prostitution in Eswatini to shift from mining areas to hotels. Post-apartheid After the end of apartheid in South Africa and conclusion of the Mozambican Civil War made its neighbors more appealing tourism destinations, the growth of the tourism industry in Eswatini decreased. Many of the tourists who visit Eswatini are traveling between Mozambique and South Africa. Most tourists only stay for one night and many visitors only take day trips to the country. Due to the lack of other major industries, tourism is viewed by many in Eswatini as a potential source for future economic growth. Since its establishment in 2003, the Eswatini Tourism Board has emphasized the fact that Eswatini is the last sub-Saharan African monarchy. Royal celebrations such as the Incwala Kingship festival are viewed as potential venues for greater tourism growth. They have also attempted to attract tourists to the game parks of Swaziland. In 2006 Eswatini signed on to the Lubombo Route agreement along with South Africa and Mozambique. The agreement allowed tourists to travel across the three countries with a single visa.

Figure 2: Molar volume vs. pressure for Œµ-Fe at room temperature. Hexaferrum and epsilon iron (Œµ-Fe) are synonyms for the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) phase of iron that is stable only at extremely high pressure. A study at the University of Rochester mixed 99.8% pure Œ±-iron powder with sodium chloride, and pressed a 0.5-mm diameter pellet between the flat faces of two diamond anvils. The deformation of the NaCl lattice, as measured by x-ray diffraction (XRD), served as a pressure indicator. At a pressure of 13 GPa and room temperature, the body-centered cubic (BCC) ferrite powder transformed to the HCP phase in Figure 1. When the pressure was lowered, Œµ-Fe transformed back to ferrite (Œ±-Fe) rapidly. A specific volume change of ‚àí0.20 cm3/mole ¬± 0.03 was measured. Hexaferrum, much like austenite, is more dense than ferrite at the phase boundary. A shock wave experiment confirmed the diamond anvil results. Epsilon was chosen for the new phase to correspond with the HCP form of cobalt.T. Takahashi & W.A. Bassett, \\"High- Pressure Polymorph of Iron,\\" Science, Vol. 145 #3631, 31 Jul 1964, p. 483‚Äì486.

Another study concerning the ferrite-hexaferrum transformation metallographically determined that it is a martensitic rather than equilibrium transformation. While hexaferrum is purely academic in metallurgical engineering, it may have significance in geology. The pressure and temperature of Earth's iron core are on the order of 150‚Äì350 GPa and 3000 ¬± 1000 ¬∞C. An extrapolation of the austenite-hexaferrum phase boundary in Figure 1 suggests hexaferrum could be stable or metastable in Earth‚Äôs core. For this reason, many experimental studies have investigated the properties of HCP iron under extreme pressures and temperatures. Figure 2 shows the compressional behaviour of Œµ-iron at room temperature up to a pressure as would be encountered halfway through the outer core of the Earth; there are no points at pressures lower than approximately 6 GPa, because this allotrope is not thermodynamically stable at low pressures but will slowly transform into Œ±-iron.

This approach to persuasive communications was first studied by Carl Hovland and his colleagues at Yale University.Aronson, Elliot, Timothy D. Wilson, and Robin M. Akert. Social Psychology. Upper Saddle River, N.J: Pearson Education, 2010. Print. The basic model of this approach can be described as \\"who said what to whom\\": the source of the communication, the nature of the communication and the nature of the audience. According to this approach, many factors affect each component of a persuasive communication. The credibility and attractiveness of the communicator (source), the quality and sincerity of the message (nature of the communication), and the attention, intelligence and age of the audience (nature of the audience) can influence an audience's attitude change with a persuasive communication. Independent variables include the source, message, medium and audience, with the dependent variable the effect (or impact) of the persuasion. The Yale attitude change approach has generated research and insight into the nature of persuasion. This approach has helped social psychologists understand the process of persuasion and companies make their marketing and advertising strategies more effective. Like most other theories about persuasion and attitude change, this approach is not perfect. Not a systematic theory about persuasive communications, this approach is a general framework within which research was conducted. The Yale researchers did not specify levels of importance among the factors of a persuasive message; they emphasized analyzing the aspects of attitude change over comparing them.Carl I. Hovland, Irving L. Janis, and Harold H. Kelley \\"Communication and Persuasion: Psychological Studies of Opinion Change\\" New Haven: Yale UP, 1953 Print. Persuasive Communication depends on who says what to whom=Defining the Who: The Source of Communication The effects of credibility rely on the aspects of the speaker to be of \\"high trustworthiness\\" or \\"low trustworthiness\\". Prominent, credible speakers can drastically persuade more people than others who are not credible. Credible speakers also have a sense of reputation where what they say matters to whom they are speaking to. In addition, attractive speakers have a stronger influence than those who are unattractive, depending on the condition. A study was conducted testing both attractive/unattractive females, as well as strong/weak messages in reference to promoting a sunscreen. They found that people were more willing to be persuaded by a strong message by an attractive female. Contrary to a weak message by an equally attractive female. CARL I. HOVLAND, WALTER WEISS; The Influence of Source Credibility on Communication Effectiveness, Public Opinion Quarterly, Volume 15, Issue 4, 1 January 1951, Pages 635‚Äì650, Defining the What: The Nature of the Communication The characteristics of the nature of the communication impacts the degree of attitude change. One such characteristic is the design of the message; people tend be more persuaded by messages that don't appear to be targeted for them. By nature, there is a primacy effect that occurs with speakers. People are more influenced by what they hear first. The first speaker is recorded stronger than the following speakers even if the arguments following the first speaker are stronger. If there is a delay after every speech, then it is better to go last because of the recency effect where people remember the most recent event the most. Defining the To Whom: The Nature of the Audience Attitude may change depending on the characteristics of the audience. Audiences that are distracted during the persuasive communication will often be persuaded less than audiences that are not distracted. From the ages of 18-25, people are very susceptible to attitude change. After those ages, people tend to be more stable and resistant to attitude change. Additionally, an audience member that is less intelligent tends to be more persuadable than those with higher intelligence. People who do not enjoy thinking can rely on experts and trustworthy sources to conserve their cognitive resources. If the expert source is untrustworthy, then the person might have to evaluate the material on their own. In most cases, people are not knowledgeable enough to interpret the information themselves or have very low confidence in the issue, thus they must rely on knowledgeable others(expert and trustworthy sources).Petty, R.

New York: Guilford Press. History The Yale Attitude Change Approach, also referred to as the Yale Model of Persuasion or Yale School Research is considered to be one of the first models of attitude change. It was a reflection of the Yale Communication Research Program's findings, a program which was set up under a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. During the early 1900s and World War II there was a heavy need for research on political persuasion as propaganda analysis and public opinion research, the Research Branch of the Army's Information and Education Division was deemed with this responsibility. The importance of understanding methods behind changing public opinion was emphasized by the success of Nazi propaganda campaigns. Carl Hovland was appointed the Chief Psychologist and director of Experimental Studies for the U.S war Department. Along with others such as, Frances J. Anderson, Arthur A. Lumsdaine, John L. Finan, Nathan Maccoby, Fred D. Sheffield, Irving L. Janis, M. Brewster Smit undertook the responsibility of conducting, analyzing, and planning experiments that explored the effectiveness of war propaganda. After the war Hovland, Arthur A. Lumsdaine, and Fred D. Sheffield published a report of the major research findings of the Experimental section of the Research Branch under the publication Experiments on Mass Communication, 1949. These experiments are considered an antecedent to the Yale groups research. Interest in persuasion remained strong after the war considering the increasing availability and advancements of telecommunications. With interests in persuasion persistent Carl Hovland, Irving Janis, Arthur A. Lumsdaine, Fred D. Sheffield and others within the \\"Yale School\\" returned to Yale with desires to continue researching the topic. They established the Yale Communication Research Program which aimed to understand and examine factors that influenced attitude change. It was considered the first modern attempt of such a task. The Yale Communication Program was a \\"cooperative research and study group\\" that encouraged members to pursue research in their line of interest regarding the subject of persuasive communication and their effects on behavior and opinion. The Yale group examined attitude change from a learning theory perspective and information processing approach. The Yale school's approach is considered convergent. As in it started with identifying a phenomenon (attitude change) and then searched for an explanation by looking at variable factors and their effect on the phenomena, as opposed to a divergent approach which starts with a theory that is then applied to a phenomenon. The Yale school also suggested that the effects of the factors contributing to attitude change depended on a sequence of message processing stages summarized as; attention, comprehension and acceptance. In essence a person must \\"first notice the message, and pay attention to it, then comprehend its meaning, and finally accept it\\". They also introduced the concept of \\"incentive\\" as a crucial variable in influencing attitude change. It was not enough for a response to be learned but that motivation was provided in order to preference one opinion over another. Hovland, Janis, and Kelly published the group's first empirical findings under the publication Communication and Persuasion (1953). They paralleled their research to Laswell's (1948) statement; who says what to whom with what effect . In the publication they categorized their findings on the analysis of four factors: \\"1) the communicator who transmits the communication; 2) the stimuli transmitted by the communicator; 3) the audience responding to the communication; 4) the responses made by the audience to the communication\\". The Yale School had a breakdown of sub-factors that they observed for each topic (The Communicator, The Communication, The Audience). The fourth topic, which they deemed \\"Responses\\" was composed of two subtopics which explored the \\"expression of the new opinion\\" and \\"retention of the opinion change\\". The Yale group had a total of five publications reporting the findings of their experiments (including Communication and Persuasion) under the same model, they were: The Order of Presentation in Persuasion, Personality and Persuasibility, Attitude Organization and Change, and Social Judgement that further explored each factor. Initial/Notable Studies by the Yale Communication Research ProgramCharacteristics of the Communicator= The Yale group observed the effects of credibility on persuasion. Credibility was composed of; 1) Expertness: the degree to which the communicator was knowledgeable in the field, and 2) Trustworthines: In reference to the intentions of the communicator. Hovland and Weiss in studies such as, The influence of source credibility on communication effectiveness (1951), exposed participants to identical newspaper and magazine articles yet attributed them to either high credibility sources (like Robert Oppenheimer) or low credibility sources (like the Soviet Newspaper Pravda). Their results indicated that participants regarded sources with higher credibility more favorably than those considered as low-credibility. They contributed this effect to the expertise of the source and the confidence in the sources sincerity in delivering the message. They also observed that effects from both positive and negative sources tended to dissipate after several weeks. An exception to the gradual dissociation of the effects of a persuasive message were reported in studies conducted by Hovland, Lumsdaine, and Shieffield. Results showed that while memory of factual information decreased or memory of the source dissipated opinion change increased gradually over time, they coined this phenomenon the Sleeper Effect. =The Content of the Communication= The Yale school focused on factors such as Motivating appeals and organization of arguments in regards to the content of the communication. In particular they focused on \\"emotional\\" appeals which were considered a class of stimuli whose contents could arouse emotion, in contrast to logical/rational appeals. In particular the group looked at fear-arousing appeals. Janis and Feshbach in their experiment Effects of Fear-arousing Communications(1953), explored degrees of intensities of fear appeal and their effects on conformity in the context of the consequences of poor dental hygiene. The study showed that messages were more effective when contained low-leveled threat references such as \\"cavities\\" or \\"tooth decay\\" instead of \\"strong appeal\\" references, such as exclaiming serious infections that could cause paralysis and kidney damage. The results suggested that appeals of high intensity would be less effective than milder ones. In regards to structure of an argument Hovland, Lumsdaine, and Sheffield explored the effectiveness of one-sided and two-sided messages (containing pros and cons). The study (referenced in Experiments on Mass Communications, 1948) looked at whether a message given to American soldiers would be more effective if it only advocated one position or if it advocated both sides of the position. It was found that two-sided messages were more effective on budging educated men's opinions. Additionally, two sided arguments were also better at generating change of opinion in those soldiers who opposed the argument initially. For less educated men who also supported the government's position, the one-sided argument was more persuasive. Their findings not only suggested that the content of the communication has an impact on attitude change but so do the attributes of the receiver. A follow up study conducted by Lumsdaine and Janis, Resistance to counter propaganda produced by a one- sided versus two-side propaganda presentation(1953), explored the resistance of opinion change motivated by argument structure. The findings summarized that two sided messages were more effective to resistance of counter propaganda regardless of initial position held (even if the initial belief was counter to the new developed belief). Two sided messages were more effective in maintaining sustained opinion change. Another study spearheaded by Hovland and Mandel, An experimental comparison of conclusion-drawing by the communicator and by the audience(1952), highlighted that messages are more persuasive when they are implicitly argued. The audience is then able to come to their own conclusion. Hovland and Mandel mentioned that this effect may only be evident with less complex issues that can easily be surmised by the audience. =The Audience= In terms of the audience the Yale group concerned themselves with the audience predisposition, which they defined as the audience's motives, abilities, personalities, and the context of the situation. In one study Kelly and Volkart, The resistance to change of group- anchored attitudes (Kelly, Volkart, 1952), confirmed the notion that individuals with greater interest in retaining group membership are less likely to adopt beliefs that contradict group standards. Their findings are consistent with the hypothesis that supports the relationship between internalization of norms and stronger group attachments. Holland et al. studied the resistance to attitude change when a person is a member of a group and discovered five factors that induce conformity of opinion within a group: 1) the individual's knowledge of group norms 2) the extent to which the individual values group membership 3) the individuals social status or rank within the group 4) particular situation cues 5) salience of the group(the extent to which a specific group is dominant in the individual's awareness at the time the 'counter persuasion' is delivered Because these five factors play an influential role in inducing conformity, members may resist attitude change when the group is exposed to a message that counters group norms/culture. The more the group membership is valued, the more resistance, to the extent that a boomerang effect may occur.  Remarks  The Yale group did ample and very meaningful research in the field of attitude change and persuasion. They brought forth emphasis on the importance of learning theories behind attitude change and laid a strong foundation of mass findings that stimulated further research related to persuasion. Examples of such work that stemmed from their findings was the inoculation theory and the social judgement theory. The research was considered a landmark in the development of attitude change and persuasion. Theoretical approaches The Yale attitude change approach is a method of making persuasive communications effective, a study begun by Carl Hovland based on his experiences during World War II attempting to boost morale in US soldiers with propaganda. This study focused on communication- bound predispositions to accept (or reject) appeals and unbound attributes, such as tendencies to particular responses to all communications. The Yale group's research \\"stemmed from a variety of theoretical approaches, including, among others, Hull's learning theory, some motivational hypotheses of Freud and other psychoanalysts, and some of the formulations of Lewin, Sherif, Newcomb, and others\\". The Yale group developed a theoretical structure linking individual attributes and persuasion based on three major factors: the source of the communication, the nature of the communication and the nature of the audience. The approach has a similar structure to Aristotle's concept of persuasion in his Rhetoric. According to Aristotle, there are three means of persuasion: the character of the speaker, the emotional state of the listener and logos (the argument itself). Contemporary psychologists use the Yale model's psychological approach and Aristotle's philosophical approach to examine components of persuasion.  Legacy of Yale Research on Theories and Models Pertaining to Attitude Change  Influences on McGuire = William McGuire(1968) further broke down Hovland et al. (1953) message processing stages (attention, comprehension, acceptance) into six stages: presentation, attention, comprehension, yielding, retention, and behavior.McGuire, W. J. (1968). Personality and attitude change: An information-processing theory. In A. G. Greenwood, T. C. Brock, & T. M. Ostrom, Psychological Foundations of Attitudes. New York: Academic Press, 171-196. In summary, McGuire proposed that a message must first be presented, drawn attention to, and then understood and comprehended by the audience. This would cause an attitude change, that must be remembered at a later time to actually influence behavioral changes. McGuire emphasized the importance of reception (the attention and comprehension stages of the Yale group) and yielding (anticipation and critical-evaluation steps) in his study of individual differences in influenceability. According to McGuire reception was positively related to ability and motivational attributes. Individual attributes also contributed to the yielding stage(acceptance of the opinion). One weakness of the approach is the nature of its steps‚Äîspecifically, the yielding step. The approach assumes that the audience's attitude will change by learning a new message, yet learning does not always result in persuasion.Benoit, W. L. (n.d.). The yale approach. In Electronic Encyclopedia of Communication. Communication Institute for Online Scholarship. Retrieved from http://www.cios.org/encyclopedia/persuasion/Byale_approach1.htm This Information processing paradigm's heritage lays in the message learning theme and theories that guided the work done on persuasion and attitude change by the Yale Communications program. McGuire is best known for his inoculation theory of exploring resistance to persuasion, which was influenced by the Yale School's research on the resilience of two-sided messages on opinion acceptance. = Influences on Dolores Albarrac√≠n's Cognition-in-Persuasion Model = The Albarrac√≠n model, which is a stage model developed in 2002, builds off both McGuire's work and the Yale attitude change approach in regards to the sequence of message processing stages. The study found that message processing may occasionally bypass early stages and takes a step towards addressing the role of processing stages on attitude change. The evidence that people can use processing stages in a different order or even skip a stage altogether was the important acknowledgment of this study. = Influences on Elaboration Likelihood Model = Another model that stems from the Yale attitude change approach is the elaboration likelihood model which is a contemporary approach to persuasion. Developed by R.E. Petty and J.T. Cacioppo during the late 1980s, the model describes two ways in which persuasive communications can cause attitude change: centrally and peripherally. The central route to persuasion occurs when people have the ability and motivation to listen to a message, think about its arguments and internalize the information. The recipient relies on cognititive responses instead of heuristics when using the central route. The peripheral route to persuasion is used when the recipient has little to no motivation or effort and people are swayed not by the argument itself but by elements secondary to the message (such as the length of the communication or the attractiveness of the communicator). Under the peripheral route, the recipient relies on the context of the situation rather than the information at hand(i.e. they look at attractiveness in this case or if the person speaking is famous or not). = Influences on Other Theories = Martin Bauer views the Yale approach from a slightly-different angle. In 2008, he argued that persuasion cannot focus only on the social influence of intersubjectivity (the sharing of subjective states by two or more individuals) but must include inter-objectivity (the understandings shared by individuals about social reality). Using the concept of the fait accompli (a completed, irreversible \\"done deal\\"), Bauer described artifacts such as nuclear power, information technology and genetic engineering as types of social influence.  Empirical findings: Modern studies exploring factors contributing to persuasion and influence  Research on external factors which influence individual's attitude has a strong focus on marketing strategy applications. Advances in technology have made mass media pervasive, communications is a $400 billion plus industry. The average American watches 38,000 commercials a year. There is vast financial gains in benefiting from studies examining the factors surrounding source credibility, communicator attractiveness, message context, and mood on persuasion and attitude change. Applications in Marketing Source credibility and experience claims in consumer advertisement = \\"Prepurchase Attribute Verifiability, Source Credibility, and Persuasion\\", a study by Shailendra Jain and Steven Posavac, examined the role message origin plays in the likelihood that a recipient will believe the message in an advertisement. Advertisements for mountain bikes and cameras were studied; consumers were asked their overall reaction to search claims (claims which can be statistically proven) and experience claims (testimonials). The credibility of the claims was also compared. Participants were shown advertisements for each of the products and asked questions about the advertisements, which contained search or experience claims. The search claim for the mountain bike was its weight, the experience claim was its ease of control. The search claim for the camera was its compactness and the experience claim was its photo quality. The results indicated that consumers were more likely to believe (and be satisfied with) claims if they thought the source was trustworthy or had experience with the product. They were more likely to believe advertisements with concrete evidence behind the claims, such as the weight of the bike or the compactness of the camera. The study demonstrates that the credibility of a source correlates with its ability to persuade. Persuasion Attractiveness as an influence on opinion change and persuasion = \\"An Attribution Analysis of Communicator Characteristics on Opinion Change: the Case of Communicator Attractiveness\\", a study by Alice Eagly and Shelly Chaiken, examined the effects of attractiveness and message content on persuasion. Eagly and Chaiken surveyed undergraduate students on communicators' attractiveness and whether they were persuaded to adopt the speaker's position (desirable or undesirable) on a topic. Students were asked to predict the speaker's position before hearing the message. The study showed that participants were more likely to be persuaded by an attractive speaker to take an undesirable position on a topic than by an unattractive speaker. However, they were equally likely to be persuaded to take a desirable position on a topic by attractive and unattractive speakers. Participants were more likely to agree with attractive speakers in general and more likely to agree with any speaker discussing a desirable position on a topic. More attractive individuals are more persuasive than individuals perceived as less attractive. Message content affects believability; desirable messages are more believable than undesirable ones.  Acceptance of Message by Recipient  Hovland statesLindzey, G. (1954). Handbook of social psychology(Vol. 11, Chapter 28, p,1083). Cambridge, Mass: Addison-Wesley another set of factors that impact attitude change, specifically, in order for the communication to be accepted by the recipient. One such factor is the prestige of the medium on which the message is communicated with. One medium may be more prestigeful than others. Most importantly, \\"prestige for whom?\\" is important to specify since certain mediums may be more prestigeful for certain segments of the population. Accordingly, how the medium differs in credibility affects the prestige of the medium; a medium judged by an individual to be the most trustworthy may be the most effective. A second factor which may affect the comparison of media is the extent of social interaction. In a study by Knower(1935), hearing a speech when a member of an audience is less effective than hearing it individually. Conversely, a study by Cantril and Allport(1935) suggest that radio may be more effective than print because the individual identifies as part of a larger group of people listening to the same program at the same time. A third factor that affects the likelihood of acceptance of the message by the recipient is the extent to which the medium provides flexibility. Flexibility in this case means the extent to which the medium can canter to special interests and differences in comprehension. Print, for example, is particularly effective by providing for specialized interests and tastes to a greater extent than other mediums. Additionally, a two-way communication network may also induce flexibility. For example, in a political campaign where a two-way communication between the studio and the listener was employed, flexibility was heightened. Accordingly, \\"questions raised by the man-in-the-street could thus be answered immediately by the political candidate in the television studio\\" Controversy A major issue with the Yale attitude change approach is the fact that it is strictly functional, focusing on a change in attitude and the information processing accompanying it. Other scholars see persuasion as a function of \\"communication, social influence, and group processes\\", taking into account other factors such as social influence and the media. A theory proposed by Margarita Sanchez-Mazas focuses on people's desire for social recognition and dignity. In this model, persuasion is seen as a way to overcome social injustice and achieve recognition and dignity. Sanchez-Mazas examines the roles of majorities and minorities in creating social change, and believes that \\"persuasion is a simultaneous, reciprocal process between groups, and specifically between majorities and minorities\\". A persuasion developed by Clelia Nascimento- Schulze emphasizes communication in a complex society. According to Nascimento-Schulze, technology and the media are used to promote science in developing countries. It was determined that the Internet was most successful at transferring scientific knowledge to the public because it contains an optimal amount of visual information and combines art and science in a creative, informative way. Key to this theory is an \\"interactive society\\" with technology allowing communities to share common values and beliefs, such as the Internet. Another form of public persuasion, studied by Helene Joffe, explores how the media produces visual stimuli which elicit feelings of fear, empathy or disgust. This theory highlights the substantial role of technology in evoking emotion in individuals, focusing on advertising campaigns for health, safety and charities. According to Joffe, visual stimuli lure an audience into a \\"state of emotion\\". The Elaboration Likelihood Model is based on the Yale Attitude Approach Model by processing the different outcomes of attitude change. However, there are also claims that they are independent entities that have no connection. Conclusions The model was a major contributor to the development and understanding of attitude change and persuasion, however it is now only one part of many perspectives on persuasion. Research in persuasion is considering the effects of the unconscious, with scholars beginning to explore the possibility of \\"priming in inducing non-conscious effects\\". This idea, new to social psychology, is beginning to shed light on the relationship between the individual unconscious and the social environment. The study of persuasion has always been an integral part of social psychology with the focus slowly moving from attitude change and behavior modification to communications, literature, art and the other humanities.

Apart from his engagement with Tivoli Gardens, where he created several prominent buildings, including the Chinese Tower and the Nimb complex, he was most active as an exhibition architect, representing Denmark at several World Fairs. Early life and career  Knud Arne Petersen was born on 5 August 1862 in Copenhagen, the son of draughtsman, art archaeologist and later professor Julius Magnus Petersen. He attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1878 to 1885 and then worked as an assistant for the architects Vilhelm Petersen, his uncle, and Martin Nyrop. Exhibition architecture Petersen's significantly contributed to the Nordic Exhibition of 1888 where he first held an administrative position as Industriforeningen manager, but later as its resident architect until 1927. In this capacity he represented Denmark on the exhibition committees for a number of large exhibitions, including the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 and the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900. He was also active in the design of the Danish contributions and brought home several medals. Tivoli Gardens In his work with the large exhibitions of the time, Petersen frequently collaborated with Tivoli Gardens and in 1899 was appointed as the amusement park's new artistic director, a position he held until 1940. He continued its tradition for festive, exotic architecture and introduced its distinctive illumination scheme. His first project was the Chinese Tower which was built to his design in 1900. He also designed the new Tivoli Concert Hall (1902) and the Nimb complex (1909), both with inspiration from Moorish architecture. Other pursuits The more notable are Ny Christiansborg, a large residential building in a prominent location on Copenhagen's waterfront, and Klampenborg Racecourse in Klampenborg.

Nature. 1996 Jul 18;382(6588):252-5. Any newly formed motor skill, such as learning to play a musical instrument or adjusting one's running stride, is subject to a consolidation period. The time course of this period during which new motor skills are susceptible to disruption appears to be on the order of a few hours.Press DZ, Casement MD, Pascual-Leone A, Robertson EM. The time course of off-line motor sequence learning. Brain Res Cogn Brain Res. 2005 Sep;25(1):375-8. Distinctions between procedural and declarative memories Motor skills, also known as procedural memories, are distinct from declarative memories, which involve memories of events, people, places, etc. Both types of memories are, however, subject to a consolidation period, though the neural mechanisms appear to differ. Some of the earliest evidence pointing to a distinction between procedural and declarative memories came from the famous neurology patient HM. As a treatment for severe epilepsy, portions of HM's temporal lobes, including both hippocampi, were removed. This left him unable to form new declarative memories (anterograde amnesia), while his ability to learn novel motor tasks remained intact.Corkin S. What's new with the amnesic patient H.M.? Nat Rev Neurosci. 2002 Feb;3(2):153-60. Motor skills and the internal model It is believed that motor skill acquisition requires learning a new internal model of limb dynamics.Shadmehr R, Holcomb HH. Neural correlates of motor memory consolidation. Science. 1997 Aug 8;277(5327):821-5. For instance, in order to reach for a cup of coffee, a person must have an implicit understanding of the mass of their own arm, and how specific patterns of muscle activation will change the position of that limb. A common model for studying motor learning and consolidation involves perturbations to reaching tasks using robotic arms to impart forces on the limb during reaches, forcing the subject to learn new internal representations of the limb to take these new external forces into account.Ahmed AA, Wolpert DM, Flanagan JR. Flexible representations of dynamics are used in object manipulation. Curr Biol. 2008 May 20;18(10):763-8. Role of sleep in motor memory consolidation A number of recent studies have begun to demonstrate the importance of sleep in the process of consolidation of both procedural and declarative memories.Fischer S, Hallschmid M, Elsner AL, Born J. Sleep forms memory for finger skills. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Sep 3;99(18):11987-91. Epub 2002 Aug 22.Walker MP, Stickgold R. Sleep-dependent learning and memory consolidation.

For instance, it was recently shown that even a short 90 minute nap after training in a skilled finger task prevented interference two hours after the task when compared to subjects that did not nap.Korman M, Doyon J, Doljansky J, Carrier J, Dagan Y, Karni A. Daytime sleep condenses the time course of motor memory consolidation. Nat Neurosci. 2007 Sep;10(9):1206-13. Epub 2007 Aug 12. During night sleep, REM sleep and slow- wave sleep both contribute to the motor memory consolidation process through an increase in neuromodulatory activity, as well as regular field potential oscillations such as sleep spindles (reviewed by Diekelmann and Born, 2010Diekelmann S, Born J., The memory function of sleep. Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010 Feb;11(2):114-26. Epub 2010 Jan 4.). Pathologies and processes affecting motor memory consolidation While the precise neural basis for motor skill consolidation is not fully understood, many of the structures necessary for the process have been identified. As the process of learning a motor skill requires both initial execution of the skill, as well as long storage of the consolidated memory, a complex network of brain areas are involved, including the primary motor cortex, the cerebellum, the prefrontal cortex, and the basal ganglia.Krakauer JW, Shadmehr R. Consolidation of motor memory. Trends Neurosci. 2006 Jan;29(1):58-64. Epub 2005 Nov 14.Miller EK, Cohen JD. An integrative theory of prefrontal cortex function.

Given that motor skill consolidation is a distributed process, the ability to form new procedural memories is susceptible to the effects of a number of processes and pathologies. Cerebellar diseases The cerebellum, and especially the cerebellar cortex, is critical for coordinating motor outputs during skilled tasks, as well as the process of stabilizing newly formed motor skills.Diedrichsen J, Verstynen T, Lehman SL, Ivry RB. Cerebellar involvement in anticipating the consequences of self-produced actions during bimanual movements. J Neurophysiol. 2005 Feb;93(2):801-12. Epub 2004 Sep 8. Damage to the cerebellum can occur through a number of causes including trauma, alcoholism, chronic degenerative diseases such as olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and genetic developmental disorders.Kandel, E., Schwartz, J., & Jessell, T. Principles of neural science. 2000: McGraw-Hill, New York.Millen KJ, Gleeson JG. Cerebellar development and disease. Curr Opin Neurobiol. 2008 Feb;18(1):12-9. Epub 2008 May 29. Parkinson's disease Parkinson's disease, which affects the basal ganglia, has been shown to cause an impairment in the ability to consolidate new motor skills.Doyon J. Motor sequence learning and movement disorders. Curr Opin Neurol. 2008 Aug;21(4):478-83. For instance, when Parkinsonian patients were tested in force field reaching tasks, they showed significantly less retention of the motor skill than controls during later testing.Krebs HI, Hogan N, Hening W, Adamovich SV, Poizner H. Procedural motor learning in Parkinson's disease. Exp Brain Res. 2001 Dec;141(4):425-37. Epub 2001 Oct 18. This points to the importance of the basal ganglia, the primary target of Parkinson's disease, in creating the new sensory/motor mappings that are necessary for the long term retention of a motor skill. Stroke A stroke is the damage of a volume of brain tissue resulting from restricted blood supply, which is often a result of occluded blood vessels leading to the brain. Given the large number of brain areas involved in the motor skill acquisition, strokes affecting any of these areas can lead to deficits in motor skill consolidation. Therapies for stroke have focused on modified practice techniques to allow the reacquisition of important skills after the damage has occurred.Krakauer JW. Motor learning: its relevance to stroke recovery and neurorehabilitation. Curr Opin Neurol. 2006 Feb;19(1):84-90. Aging Aging has been shown to have an effect on declarative memory consolidation, which appears to be related to disruptions of sleep patterns,Buckley TM, Schatzberg AF. Aging and the role of the HPA axis and rhythm in sleep and memory-consolidation. Am J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2005 May;13(5):344-52. as well as hippocampal degeneration.Ward MT, Oler JA, Markus EJ. Hippocampal dysfunction during aging I: deficits in memory consolidation. Neurobiol Aging. 1999 Jul-Aug;20(4):363-72. However, aging does not appear to have a direct effect on motor skill consolidation, with subjects up to 95 years of age showing the ability to retain newly formed motor skills up to two years after acquisition.Smith CD, Walton A, Loveland AD, Umberger GH, Kryscio RJ, Gash DM Memories that last in old age: motor skill learning and memory preservation.

He graduated from Occidental College with a BA, and from Princeton University with an MPA. He later received an honorary Ph.D from Occidental College. He is currently director of the RAND Corporation's Center for Middle East Public Policy. Life and career Aaron was born in Chicago, Illinois, United States. He entered the U.S. foreign service in 1962, where he served as a political and economic officer in Guayaquil, Ecuador. In 1964 he was assigned to the NATO desk at the Department of State. He subsequently served as a political officer to NATO where he worked on the Nuclear Planning Group and on the Non Proliferation Treaty. He then joined the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency where he served as a member of the U.S. Delegation to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT), during which Aaron was a key negotiator of an agreement with the Soviet Union to reduce the risk of nuclear weapon accidents. He was then recruited to serve on Henry Kissinger's National Security Council staff during the Nixon administration, from 1972 to 1974. During that time, Aaron drafted NSSM 242 on Nuclear Strategy, which came to be known as the Schlesinger Doctrine. In 1974, on the recommendation of Zbigniew Brzezinski, Aaron became Senator Walter Mondale's legislative assistant. The following year, Aaron was task force leader of the Senate's Select Committee on Intelligence. He was the principal architect of the Committee's recommendations. Aaron later followed Mondale to the Jimmy Carter Presidential campaign. In 1977, Aaron was asked by Zbigniew Brzezinski, who had been appointed the National Security Advisor, to become Deputy National Security Advisor in the administration of Jimmy Carter. Aaron was one of several former Kissinger aides appointed by Jimmy Carter to foreign policy and defense positions. During his time at the White House, Aaron made a name for himself in foreign policy circles and was recognized as a rising star in the Democratic Party. Aaron was a special envoy to Africa, Latin America, China, Israel and Europe, and became a trusted envoy on Presidential missions. Shortly after Carter's inauguration, Aaron attended the Bilderberg Conference, in which he undertook lengthy private discussions with German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. In Israel, Aaron worked with Moshe Dayan on the concept of \\"autonomy\\" for the Palestinians. This concept helped to open the door for the Camp David Agreements, which are understood to have structured peace between Egypt and Israel. Aaron also represented the White House in talks with the Office of French President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing in Paris, as well as with the Cabinet Office at 10 Downing Street in London. President Carter tapped Aaron to lead an inter-agency mission to structure an agreement with European nations to deploy U.S. Pershing Missiles and Ground Launched Cruise Missiles in Europe, in response to the deployment of SS-20 Intermediate Missiles by the Soviet Union. He persuaded key governments to accept the U.S. deployments, as well as to seek negotiations with the U.S.S.R. for the future bilateral elimination of the deployments. Aaron was also seen as a tough and sometimes controversial figure. The U.S. Ambassador in Paris complained that he was going behind his back in secret dealings with French President Giscard d'Estaing's office. In 1978, he came head to head with Director of Central Intelligence Turner of the CIA, on Turner's cutbacks and at the CIA. Aaron's image as a \\"tough customer\\" was intensified during an attack on North Yemen by South Yemen which was backed by the Soviet Union. President Carter, Brzezinski and Cyrus Vance were on a mission to Egypt and Israel. He remained in Washington to coordinate the U.S. response. Aaron's hard-line against Communist expansion led him to push for the dispatch of $400 million in arms to North Yemen. White House staff commented on his tough rule, one staff member was quoted as saying, \\"Believe it or not, people were relieved when Brzezinski got back to town\\". When Reagan became President in 1981, Aaron moved into the private sector, becoming Vice President for Mergers and Acquisitions at Oppenheimer and Co. and Vice Chairman of Oppenheimer International. Aaron left Oppenheimer in 1985, to write and lecture, but went on to serve on the board of directors of Oppenheimer's Quest for Value Dual Purpose Fund. Over the next several years he published three novels (State Scarlet; Agent of Influence and Crossing By Night) which were translated into ten languages. He also wrote a television documentary, \\"The Lessons of the Gulf War\\", hosted by former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff William J. Crowe. He was also a consultant for the 20th Century Fund, from 1990 to 1992. Aaron was involved in the election campaigns of Walter Mondale and Bill Clinton. In Mondale's campaign, Aaron played a leading role as senior consultant on foreign policy and defense. Aaron served in Clinton's foreign policy team during his election campaign. In 1993 he became United States Permanent Representative to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris, and in 1996 was assigned the additional job of White House Special Envoy for Cryptography. At the OECD he successfully negotiated the Convention to Prohibit Bribery in International Business Transactions. As Special Envoy for Cryptography, Aaron pushed for a global standard that would require computer users with high grade encryption to submit keys to their codes for scrambling data to an independent authority, which would hold them in escrow and make them available to law enforcement only under a court order. At the time, he argued that unbreakable codes in the hands of terrorists would threaten every country's security. However, he was attacked by advocates of privacy rights, who said that the compromise could easily be misused by Governments and corporations. In 1997 he was appointed Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, where ironically he negotiated privacy rules with the European Union on the handling of personal data. After Clinton's second term in office, Aaron became senior international advisor at Dorsey & Whitney. He left Dorsey & Whitney in 2003 to join the RAND Corporation as a senior fellow. At RAND, he directs The Center For Middle East Public Policy and recently produced a non fiction book, \\"In their Own Words: Voices of Jihad\\", published by the RAND Corporation. He is a member of the American Ditchley Foundation, the Atlantic Council, the Council on Foreign Relations, the International League of Human Rights, the National Democratic Institute, and the Pacific Council on International Policy.

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History During the 13th Century Dardagny Castle, along with Bruel, La Corbi√®re and Malval, formed a ring of castles, which secured the western boundary of the lands of the Bishop of Geneva. In 1298 there were two castles, which were separated by a small road. Each one belonged to one of the two noble families in Dardagny. In the 14th Century, the south building was over two stories high and had a tower. In 1646, the Favre family inherited, both feudal domains in the village. Daniel Favre joined the two castles in 1655 through a gallery. He also built three towers and expanded the entire building. In 1721 Dardagny Castle went to Jean Vasserot who had the courtyard roofed over and converted into a feast hall which was decorated with Italian paintings. In 1740 staircase was built in the small central tower and the received its present appearance. It was purchased in 1904 by the municipality. They restored it in 1926 and 1932, after initially considering demolishing the building. Since then, the building has housed local government and a school.

European warfare during the Middle Ages was marked by a transformation in the character of warfare from antiquity, changing military tactics, and the role of cavalry and artillery. In addition to military, tactical and technological innovations during this period, chivalric military and religious ideals arose, giving motivation for engagement in the ceaseless warfare. In the Iberian Peninsula (particularly in Spain or future Spanish territories), chivalric ideals and institutions would be adopted and exercised with more fervour than anywhere else.Prestage, p. 109 Early Spanish chivalry Chivalry, or chivalric codes of manners and proper military engagement, is believed to have arrived in the Iberian Peninsula during the 10th century, in the context of the Reconquista. This was when Frankish knights, who were willing to fight the Muslim invaders of Iberia prior to the Crusades, appeared to protect pilgrims flocking to what was believed to be the tomb of the apostle James in Galicia.Contamine, pp. 55‚Äì6 St. James himself was known and celebrated in Christianity as ‚Äòthe slayer of the Moors‚Äô, and the discovery of his body by Christians has been considered an igniting factor of the Reconquista.Barber, p. 145 The Reconquista had begun under Alfonso II (791‚Äì842) and would last nearly 700 years as Christians attempted to drive Muslims out of the Iberian Peninsula. However, the in- statement of chivalric knightly orders and the chivalric ideals and codes of conduct weren‚Äôt present on the Iberian Peninsula until almost the second century of the Reconquista. In the context of the Reconquista, and the close proximity of Christian and Muslim populations, the atmosphere for the development of Knightly Orders was ripe, and in the subsequent centuries, chivalry flourished in Spain to a greater extent than in other Christian states. Chivalry in medieval Spain cannot be understood outside of the context of the military orders of knighthood. Historians are conflicted as to whether Spanish knights were directed more by royalty (such as the king of Castile or the king of Aragon), or by the Papacy. But there seems to be a consensus that the knights had obligations to both and an overarching allegiance to the Church, as both were in direct contact with knights (and often royalty were themselves, knights and crusaders).Contamine, p. 277 Some scholars have suggested that the later Spanish military Orders, like that at the fortress of Calatrava, pledged their loyalty primarily to their Kingdom, in this case Castile, but orders like the Templars or Hospitallers were more independent and not necessarily loyal to any kingdom consistently. The uniqueness of Spanish chivalry The Iberian Peninsula had multiple factors contributing to the strong chivalric ethos exemplified by Spanish knights. One determinate factor to the strong adoption of chivalric orders in Spain is the Reconquista, in which Christian kingdoms attempted to expel Muslims from the peninsula. The greatest foes of the Spanish knights were Muslims, who were not an imagined enemy but one deeply entrenched in reality and not as distant as the infidel, or enemy, was for the knights of France or Germany. In other Christian kingdoms, the fighting was initially waged between Christians of different kingdoms, and as such was more debated and contested within Christian circles.Prestage, pp. 81, 109 However, in Spain, the Christian knights and kingdoms were engaged with what was almost acknowledged as a foe to Christianity, and this common enemy had some role in uniting Christian kingdoms in the cause of the Crusades and Reconquista.Ludlow, James M. Age of the Crusades. Charles Scribner‚Äôs Sons Ltd. 1910 ‚Äì p74 In the 12th and 13th century, most of the prominent Spanish knightly orders were formed. The early formation of the orders was dangerous and unstable. In Calatrava, in the mid-12th century, Castilian knights established a fortress, which would later be abandoned due to the threat of a Muslim attack. Within fifty years, a fort of the Order of Calatrava was rebuilt and became a fortified monastic community.Barber, p. 147 Castillo de Calatrava la Nueva The prominence of knightly orders in the political and military realms of the Christian kingdoms of the peninsula fluctuated with the crusader zeal of the kingdoms‚Äô rulers; however, their power was not exclusively tied to the Crusader Kings. For instance, Ferdinand III of Castile‚Äôs reign facilitated the rise of more Spanish orders because of the desire in the kingdom, led by the king, to crusade against the Moors.Barber, p. 148 After the death of Ferdinand III, Castile was relatively peaceful and the morale of the orders was undermined. In this period of peace between the orders and the Muslims, mercenaries were hired to replace and assist knights in their fighting, Masters of the Orders were no longer religiously appointed, and civil war was waged between Christian knights with conflicting loyalties. The decline of knightly orders in Spain is debatable. Some historians have attributed the fall of chivalry and knightly orders to Miguel de Cervantes, because he ‚Äúsmiled Spain‚Äôs chivalry away‚Äù with his satirical novel Don Quixote (published in two parts, 1605 and 1615). Others have suggested that chivalry's decline was due to the expulsion of the Muslims in 1492, or the centralization of political power under the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella.The Spanish Military Orders. Chivalricorders.org. Retrieved on 2011-06-04. Once the Moors were expelled, the four orders were perceived as powerful subjects and it became a priority for the Crown to gain control over them ‚Äì particularly at a time when the Crown was struggling to establish its central authority. If one subscribes to this latter view (the earlier fall of chivalry and knightly orders at the end of the 15th century), then clearly Cervantes did not so much contribute to that event, as to document (at the beginning of the 17th century) its prior occurrence, a point that is central to Don Quixote, that this decline had already occurred at the time of Quixote's adventures. The Spanish kings had frequently obtained the election of close connections of their families as Masters of the Orders and at Calatrava in 1489, Santiago in 1494, and Alc√°ntara in 1495, the administration of the three Magisteries were ultimately granted to King Ferdinand of Arag√≥n, as Sovereign of Arag√≥n and King-Consort of Castille. Finally, by the Bull Dum intra of Pope Adrian VI dated 4 May 1523, the perpetual administration' of the three orders was transferred to \\"Charles I (the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V), King of Spain, and his heirs and successors‚Ä¶‚Äù Spain Romances of Chivalry Spainthenandnow.

Later incarnations of Spanish chivalry After the Reconquista and the loss of their prominence, Spanish orders would find a new role as an elite corps of the nobility, maintaining their castles and estates as commanderies to provide incomes for those who had distinguished themselves in the service of the monarch. The succeeding centuries saw the rise of the Spanish Empire, and the chivalric ideals of the knights transcended and reappeared in the guise of the conquistadors in the New World. ‚ÄúThe rewards for the conquistador were similar to those of his medieval predecessor, the reconquistador: land to conquer, people to convert to Christianity, and glory or fame. The one major difference was that the conquistadors and reconquistadores were real people who also sought wealth whereas the knight-errant of the romances was a fictional creature indifferent to material gain. Bernal D√≠az de Castillo, a soldier who took part in the conquest of Mexico, put the conquistador‚Äôs objective succinctly: 'we came here to serve God and the king and also to get rich'‚Äù.Elliott, J.H Imperial Spain 1469‚Äì1716 London 1963 ‚Äì pg 53The Military Order of Calatrava .

El Cantar de Myo √áid ( El Poema de Myo √áid or Mio Cid, known as The Song of my Lord, known in English as The Lay of the Cid and The Poem of the Cid) is the oldest preserved Spanish epic poem. Based on a true story, it tells of the Spanish hero El Cid, and takes place during the Reconquista. ‚ÄúThe protagonist of the poem is the historical Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar (1045‚Äì1099), also known as Cid (a dialectal form of the Arabic word sayyid, 'lord' or 'master') and Campeador ('Battler' or 'Victor'). The poem begins with the departure of Rodrigo from his home in Vivar, the first of two exiles of Rodrigo decreed by Alfonso VI, king of Castile and Leon (1065‚Äì1109). In the poem, this first exile (1081) and the second (1089) are conflated and lead to the Cid's military campaigns in the Spanish Levant, culminating in the Cid's conquest of the Moorish kingdom of Valencia (1094).

Don Quixote Don Quixote, his horse Rocinante and his squire Sancho Panza after an unsuccessful attack on a windmill. By Gustave Dor√© Don Quixote is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes. Published in two volumes in 1605 and 1615, Don Quixote is the most influential work of literature from the Spanish Golden Age in the Spanish literary canon. ‚ÄúA Spanish knight, about fifty years of age, who lived in great poverty in a village of La Mancha, gave himself up so entirely to reading the romances of chivalry, of which he had a large collection, that in the end they turned his brain, and nothing would satisfy him but that he must ride abroad on his old horse, armed with spear and helmet, a knight-errant, to encounter all adventures, and to redress the innumerable wrongs of the world. He induced a neighbour of his, a poor and ignorant peasant called Sancho Panza, mounted on a very good ass, to accompany him as squire. The knight saw the world only in the mirror of his beloved romances; he mistook inns for enchanted castles, windmills for giants, and country wenches for exiled princesses. His high spirit and his courage never failed him, but his illusions led him into endless trouble. In the name of justice and chivalry he intruded himself on all whom he met, and assaulted all whom he took to be making an oppressive or discourteous use of power. He and his poor squire were beaten, trounced, cheated, and ridiculed on all hands, until in the end, by the kindliness of his old friends in the village, and with the help of some new friends who had been touched by the amiable and generous character of his illusions, the knight was cured of his whimsies and was led back to his home in the village, there to die.‚Äù \\"Don Quixote\\", By Sir Walter Alexander Raleigh Prominent knightly orders of Spain Order of Calatrava ‚Äì was the first military order founded in Castile, but the second to receive papal approval.

The likely need for such a constituency to be created arose from the major 2013 Review of constituencies in England, instigated by the coalition government's legislation requiring constituencies to be within 5% of a given size. The portmanteau name is the same as that used for a previous proposal first introduced in the 1970s to combine Cornwall and Devon together in an economic, political and statistical sense to form a South West region. In a nationwide study into the 2013 Review, the research group Democratic Audit considered the South West England review area, and published an idea of how the redrawn map might look. In that model the resulting cross- border constituency was called \\"Torridge and Tintagel\\".The UK's New Political MapBoundary change will \\"destroy LibDem vote\\" Cornwall24 The Boundary Commission for England published its actual initial proposals on 13 September 2011, proposing a cross-border constituency as \\"Bude and Bideford\\",Current Review ‚Äì South West Boundary Commission for England which was amended in October 2012 as \\"Bideford, Bude and Launceston\\".Proposed map = Bideford, Bude and Launceston Boundary Commission for England Background The Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 proposed changes to the boundaries and number of UK constituencies, requiring that the electorate of each constituency must be within 5 percent of the national average. An amendment to the bill by Lord Teverson that would have ensured that \\"all parts of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly must be included in constituencies that are wholly in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly\\" was defeated by 250 to 221 votes in the House of Lords. Opposition There was strong cross party opposition to the bill in Cornwall due to some people believing the Cornish border would \\"not be respected\\" when the new constituency boundaries are drawn up. Commenting on this, Prime Minister David Cameron said \\"It's the Tamar, not the Amazon, for Heaven's sake\\", referring to the fact that the River Tamar currently forms most of the border between Cornwall and Devon. Alison Seabeck, a Labour MP for Plymouth Moor View, said that \\"This is a very contentious subject, and I think Mr Cameron owes the public an explanation. This is a very sensitive issue.\\"However, Mark Harper, junior minister for Political and Constitutional Reform, pointed out that the two counties already shared a police force, and an MEP, so an MP across the Tamar River divide is not \\"impossible\\". (subscription required) Around 500 people gathered at a rally in Saltash organised by its mayor, Adam Killeya who said of the border that it was \\"ancient and distinctive\\" and most people wanted to continue with that status. Guest speakers included Conservative MP Sheryll Murray, Liberal Democrat MP Steve Gilbert, UKIP MEP Trevor Colman and Mebyon Kernow councillor and deputy leader Andrew Long. At the rally Steve Gilbert said that \\"This is Cornwall and over there, that's England. When David Cameron said this is not the Amazon he was right... it's much more important.\\" On the same day the Cornish and Celtic campaigner Michael Chappell announced that he was prepared to go on hunger strike over the boundary issue..

The process of social tuning is particularly powerful in situations where one person wants to be liked or accepted by another person or group. However, social tuning occurs both when people meet for the first time, as well as among people who know each other well. Social tuning occurs both consciously and subconsciously. As research continues, the application of the theory of social tuning broadens. Social psychology bases many of its concepts on the belief that a person's self concept is shaped by the people with whom he or she interacts. Social tuning allows people to learn about themselves and the social world through their interactions with others. People mold their own views to match those of the people surrounding them through social tuning in order to develop meaningful relationships. These relationships then play an integral role in developing one's self-esteem and self-concept. Theoretical approaches Social tuning theory describes the process whereby people adopt another person's attitudes or opinions regarding a particular subject. This phenomenon is also termed \\"shared reality theory.\\" The study of this occurrence began in 1902 when Charles Cooley coined the term \\"looking glass self\\", stating that people see themselves and their own social world through the eyes of others. Research further discovered that people create their self-images through their beliefs of how others perceive them. Many people adopt the views of those surrounding them in an effort to feel like they belong and feel liked. In 1934, Mead determined that not only do individuals shape their self-concepts according to the perspectives of others, but also that people's views of themselves are continually maintained according to these adopted ideas. Later research showed that social tuning tends to be a particularly strong phenomenon when two people want to get along with each other. This is shown through social bonds which can be strengthened and reinforced through a perceived sense of shared beliefs. In addition, these shared ideas create a person's comprehension of their environment and world as a whole. Individuals believe that they have the same attitudes regarding certain ideas and experiences as the other. One particular aspect of social tuning, stereotyping, has been a popular theme in this field's research over time. One specific method explores the idea that individuals of a certain group are influenced by the ideas of others from the out-group (Crocker, Major & Steele, 1998). These interactions yield the particular stereotyped group to internalize and believe the way others view them. Therefore, self-stereotyping manifests in certain individuals. However, in this case, the presence of self-stereotyping is immensely determined by the relationship with whom the stereotyped individual interacts with. In 2006, Sinclair and Huntsinger explored the idea of why other people will change their beliefs and attitudes in order to get along with others and feel accepted. Their research focuses on why individuals from targeted groups will act and behave according to \\"cultural stereotypes\\". They used two hypotheses originally coined by Hardin & Conley in 2001, \\"Affiliative Social-Tuning\\" and \\"Domain Relevance Hypothesis\\". The first of these, \\"Affiliative Social-Tuning Hypothesis\\", pertains to the idea that certain concepts will be shared between individuals especially when affiliative motivation is high. For example, in a situation with a member from a targeted group and a member from a neutral group, the former will act accordingly to how the latter stereotypes his group. However, this is contingent on the fact that affiliative motivation is high, in other words, if there is a desire for the former to create a bond with the latter. The second, \\"Domain Relevance Hypothesis\\", explains that \\"when confronted with multiple applicable views on which to construct a shared understanding with another person, an individual will choose to social tune toward only those views that will lead to the development of the most precise shared understanding with the person\\". In other words, when many views are available to be socially tuned between individuals, only certain concepts will be shared. The concepts chosen are the ideas that yield the best common understanding between the two individuals. Empirical approaches One of the most famous experiments demonstrating the social tuning phenomenon was done by Stacy Sinclair. Her research reveals the effect of likability on people's drive to social tune. Participants engaged with researchers who were either likable or non-likable and who were either wearing a shirt stating anti-racist thoughts, specifically a shirt with the word \\"Eracism\\", or a blank shirt. The participants were then asked to complete a subconscious prejudice test, and when the researcher was likable, participants demonstrated significantly less racist attitudes on the test, than if that researcher was unlikable. Since the participants seemed to shape their views to that of the experimenter only when he or she was \\"likable\\", this study can be shown to reveal that people are more prone to adopt the views of others through social tuning when they like that person. This aspect of social tuning could be explained by the psychological assumption that people want to be liked by those that they themselves like, and therefore people will shape their views to match those of a person from whom they seek social acceptance. A similar study by Janetta Lun demonstrates another aspect of social tuning with respect to racism, and suggests that people who do not already hold strong beliefs about social prejudice are more likely to socially tune their beliefs with others around them than those who do already hold strong opinions. In this study, participants were given an implicit attitude test to determine their existing levels of implicit prejudice. Next they were taken into another room with either an experimenter who had the word \\"ERACISM\\" on their shirt, or with an experimenter in a plain T-shirt for the control condition. In the first condition, participants were asked to read the word \\"ERACISM\\" off the experimenter's T-shirt, and then in the control they were asked to read a series of nonsense letters. They were then given another implicit attitudes test to determine their implicit prejudice. Lun found that people who had less accessible attitudes (determined by the first implicit attitudes test) had lower implicit prejudice after interacting with the experimenter who held clear egalitarian views. Alternatively, those who already held strong beliefs about prejudice did not change their implicit prejudice after interacting with the egalitarian experimenter. This study demonstrates that when individuals do not hold already strong beliefs, they are more likely to seek knowledge from those around them, and therefore more likely to engage in social tuning. Lun's experiment suggests the likelihood of social tuning when people seek knowledge on a particular subject. In this case, the participants who did not hold strong opinions on the subject of prejudice, and thus presumably had less knowledge on the subject, molded their opinions to match the information they were given by the experimenter in the form of the word \\"ERACISM\\" on her shirt, and therefore they demonstrated stronger egalitarian views than they had when initially arriving at the experiment. People who are uncomfortable in situations where they feel they do not have enough information will attempt to get information through their interactions with others. Lun's experiment reveals how social tuning is a part of such a process, in which people with less knowledge are more likely to mold their beliefs to that of others. Further research by Aaron Root has been completed, examining opinions on homosexuality. During this experiment, the researcher, who always wore a pro- homosexuality shirt, followed a script that was designed to control the participant's desire to get along with the researcher. In the high-level condition, the experimenter was friendly and amiable; he offered candy at the beginning of the study and spoke enthusiastically about the experiment. In the low-level condition, the experimenter's dialogue was concise (to the point of rudeness) and he even made a point of putting away the candy basket without offering any. To emphasize this action, the experimenter made a comment about not knowing why the other experimenters insisted on giving candy out. In the trials with an amicable experimenter, the participants were more gay-friendly on the implicit attitudes tests. The opposite resulted from the interaction with a less-likable experimenter. The subject would adopt the views of the message printed on the experimenter's shirt if he was nicer. Curtis Hardin, co-author of \\"Shared Reality, System Justification, and the Relational Basis of Ideological Beliefs\\", has performed numerous experiments in social tuning across a wide variety of ideals. His experiments explore how individual experience reflects a kind of tension among relationships. In one experiment, automatic homophobic attitudes manifest in the participant after an interaction with an evidently gay experimenter, but only for subjects who do not have gay friends. In another study by Hardin, unconscious threats to religious experience reduce commitment for participants who do not share the experience with their father or minister. For those who do perceive the religious experience to be shared, the unconscious threat causes increased religious commitment. In a third study, people become more anti-black when they are included (as opposed to excluded) in a game played with ostensible racists. The effect is reversed when the participants have are extra motivated to engage with the racists. Similar studies have been performed with gender. In an experiment by Hardin and Higgins (1996), participants were given information about a \\"target\\" which they would inform a perceived audience about. The \\"communicators\\" changed the different summaries of information (sometimes to incorrect information) to best correspond with the attitudes of the audience which they were informed of by the researchers. The motivation of the communicator determined the extent to which they would alter their message to suit the audience. However, the communicator soon began believing their edited information about the target as a direct source of information. The memory and beliefs towards the target were then influenced. As time passed, communicators' belief that their message as a source of information about the target increased and their memory was altered. Thus the communicator adopted the believed beliefs of the audience which he was trying to inform. Applications Social tuning has resounding influences on both the memory and cognition of those affected by this process. Though social tuning could potentially aid memory and cognition should the views of the other person be correct, this phenomenon could also impede memory and cause incorrect cognition. For example, if an individual seeks a relationship with another individual who holds negative opinions about homosexuality, the first individual could be at risk for mirroring those negative opinions in order to be liked by the second individual. Such phenomenon can be harmful, in that they can cause people to hold opinions on subjects that are not based on concrete information, but on the opinions of others. Controversies Social tuning can be particularly strong when in relation to controversial topics. Judgments based on sexual orientation, race, religion and even a politics can be substantially altered based on the opinions of those around a subject. The result being that it is not only highly unlikely that a subject would openly disagree with these feelings, but actually adopt them and proclaim them as genuinely their own. In addition, social tuning is a large contributor to prejudice and racism. For example, many individuals adopt their views about race or about their out-groups according to the ideas of those surrounding them. Social tuning with respect to race often occurs through parental influence. A child without sufficient information about race, and who seeks the approval of his or her parent will likely shape their own beliefs about race based on the beliefs of their parents. As noted earlier (see \\"Major Theoretical Approaches\\"), self tuning has been linked to many issues regarding stereotyping. For example, individuals of commonly stereotyped groups are at risk of social tuning in certain situations. For example, Michael Inzlicht coined the term \\"threatening environments\\", which pertain to occasions when individuals perceive that they are being \\"devalued, stigmatized, or discriminated against\\" by a non-stereotyped group. In this environment, it is common that the individuals of a perceived \\"lower-status\\" will social tune to the ideas of the \\"higher-status\\". This results in internalized racism of the former group. However, it has been noted that under certain conditions interactions between heterogeneous groups can result more in a more positive manner. For example, situations that are perceived as \\"safe and nonthreatening\\", by both the stigmatized and non-stigmatized group \\"are likely to lead to positive self-expansion and social tuning, reduced prejudice and discrimination, and positive group attitudes\\". On the other hand, research has showed that self tuning to ideas of one's ingroup, and not one's outgroup can often lead to more damaging results (7). Due to the fact that members of the same group are closer and trust one another, they are more likely to tune to the ideas of each other. Therefore, a member that holds a negative self- stereotype of himself and his own group is more dangerous to his comrades than an individual on the outside who shares the same views. Research has been conducted on how an individual from a stereotyped group can best avoid the dangers of self-tuning from an out-group. As Sinclair suggests, \\"members of stigmatized groups need to be careful with whom they develop relationships\\", and thus they \\"can reduce the likelihood of negative social tuning by remaining interpersonally distant from those with stereotypical views\\". Conclusion Social tuning is an intriguing social phenomenon that affects our personal beliefs and views both on a long-term and short-term basis. It impacts many important aspects of an individual's life, and can even play a role in determining a person's beliefs on a variety of important subjects. For example, it plays a large role in our self-concept and our views of others. There are certain situations which heighten the likelihood that a person will engage in social tuning, for example when an individual wants to be liked by another or when an individual does not already hold strong opinions on a subject. Overall, social tuning is an important social psychological theory as it explains the many beliefs we hold about ourselves, others, and the world around us.

The MCO has performed throughout Russia and other East European countries. The orchestra was founded in 1876 as a result of an agreement between the Russian state and the Metropolitan Chamber Orchestra (MCO), the Moscow Philharmonic's predecessor, which provided the resources to expand and improve the repertoire of the orchestra. The MCO has since played in over eighty nations and played several million live concert concerts worldwide. History Rudolf Barshai, founder Rudolf Barshai, a founding member of Borodin Quartet, left the Quartet to pursue his conducting ambitions. He assembled young, talented musicians and soon the first Chamber Orchestra in the former USSR had its inaugural concert in the Small Hall of the Moscow Conservatory on April 2, 1956. The Orchestra debuted at the Bath Festival organized in England in 1962. The Moscow Chamber Orchestra became the most traveled classical music ensemble in the former Soviet Union and toured the world from Eastern Europe to Canada and the United States and from Japan to South America. The MCO performed 18th-century music by composers such as Mozart and Haydn, and contemporary music: its recording of Mozart's symphonies was the first to observe all the notated repeats. Many composers dedicated their compositions to the Moscow Chamber Orchestra, such as Dmitri Shostakovich, Revol Bunin, Mieczys≈Çaw Weinberg, Boris Tchaikovsky and many others. The Orchestra performed many world-premiers of contemporary compositions, such as Dmitri Shostakovich's Symphony No.14, in Leningrad, on September 29, 1969. World-famous musicians performed and recorded with the Orchestra: Yehudi Menuhin, Sviatoslav Richter, David Oistrakh, Emil Gilels, Leonid Kogan, Malcolm Frager, to name a few. Following Barshai‚Äôs emigration to the West in 1977, Igor Semyonovich Bezrodny () was appointed a new conductor and an artistic director of the Orchestra. He led the Orchestra until 1981. For the next 10 years Moscow Chamber Orchestra was led by Victor Tretiakov, then Andrei Korsakov. Constantin Orbelian was appointed a new conductor in 1991; he was succeeded by Alexei Utkin (), in 2010.

In that sense it is dual to the union-find data structure, which also maintains a partition into disjoint sets but in which the operations merge pairs of sets. Partition refinement forms a key component of several efficient algorithms on graphs and finite automata, including DFA minimization, the Coffman‚ÄìGraham algorithm for parallel scheduling, and lexicographic breadth- first search of graphs.... Data structure A partition refinement algorithm maintains a family of disjoint sets . At the start of the algorithm, this family contains a single set of all the elements in the data structure. At each step of the algorithm, a set is presented to the algorithm, and each set in the family that contains members of is split into two sets, the intersection and the difference . Such an algorithm may be implemented efficiently by maintaining data structures representing the following information: *The ordered sequence of the sets in the family, in a form such as a doubly linked list that allows new sets to be inserted into the middle of the sequence *Associated with each set , a collection of its elements of , in a form such as a doubly linked list or array data structure that allows for rapid deletion of individual elements from the collection. Alternatively, this component of the data structure may be represented by storing all of the elements of all of the sets in a single array, sorted by the identity of the set they belong to, and by representing the collection of elements in any set by its starting and ending positions in this array. *Associated with each element, the set it belongs to. To perform a refinement operation, the algorithm loops through the elements of the given set . For each such element , it finds the set that contains , and checks whether a second set for has already been started. If not, it creates the second set and add to a list of the sets that are split by the operation. Then, regardless of whether a new set was formed, the algorithm removes from and adds it to . In the representation in which all elements are stored in a single array, moving from one set to another may be performed by swapping with the final element of and then decrementing the end index of and the start index of the new set. Finally, after all elements of have been processed in this way, the algorithm loops through , separating each current set from the second set that has been split from it, and reports both of these sets as being newly formed by the refinement operation. The time to perform a single refinement operations in this way is , independent of the number of elements in the family of sets and also independent of the total number of sets in the data structure. Thus, the time for a sequence of refinements is proportional to the total size of the sets given to the algorithm in each refinement step. Applications An early application of partition refinement was in an algorithm by for DFA minimization. In this problem, one is given as input a deterministic finite automaton, and must find an equivalent automaton with as few states as possible. Hopcroft's algorithm maintains a partition of the states of the input automaton into subsets, with the property that any two states in different subsets must be mapped to different states of the output automaton. Initially, there are two subsets, one containing all the accepting states of the automaton and one containing the remaining states. At each step one of the subsets and one of the input symbols of the automaton are chosen, and the subsets of states are refined into states for which a transition labeled would lead to , and states for which an -transition would lead somewhere else. When a set that has already been chosen is split by a refinement, only one of the two resulting sets (the smaller of the two) needs to be chosen again; in this way, each state participates in the sets for refinement steps and the overall algorithm takes time , where is the number of initial states and is the size of the alphabet.. Partition refinement was applied by in an efficient implementation of the Coffman‚ÄìGraham algorithm for parallel scheduling. Sethi showed that it could be used to construct a lexicographically ordered topological sort of a given directed acyclic graph in linear time; this lexicographic topological ordering is one of the key steps of the Coffman‚ÄìGraham algorithm. In this application, the elements of the disjoint sets are vertices of the input graph and the sets used to refine the partition are sets of neighbors of vertices. Since the total number of neighbors of all vertices is just the number of edges in the graph, the algorithm takes time linear in the number of edges, its input size.. Partition refinement also forms a key step in lexicographic breadth-first search, a graph search algorithm with applications in the recognition of chordal graphs and several other important classes of graphs. Again, the disjoint set elements are vertices and the set represent sets of neighbors, so the algorithm takes linear time...

It flows through hilly country, and has sections of whitewater rapids. Much of its flow comes from springs. The river ends at Deer Point Lake, a reservoir that provides the freshwater supply for Panama City and much of Bay County. The name \\"Econfina\\" derives from the Creek ekana, which means \\"earthy\\", and feno, which means \\"bridge\\" or \\"footlog\\", referring to a natural bridge that crossed the river about upstream from its mouth until it collapsed in the 19th century. The Pensacola ‚Äì St. Augustine road (the Bellamy Road) built in the 1820s crossed this natural bridge. Course Econfina Creek arises in the southwest corner of Jackson County, flows into Bay County, thence into Washington County, and returns to Bay County to end in Deer Point Lake. Deer Point Lake is a reservoir that empties directly into North Bay, an arm of St. Andrews Bay. Econfina Creek is long and has a watershed of . Econfina Creek flows through a hilly limestone karst landscape, and there are springs, sinkholes, caves and rock outcrops along the river. One cave by the river is the only known location for a species of snail (Dasyscias franzi) that feeds on wood carried into the cave by beavers. The vegetation along the river includes plants typical of the Appalachian mountains, but rarely found in Florida. Springs Williford Springs Much of the river's flow comes from 11 named springs or spring groups consisting of more than 36 vents, including the first magnitude Gainer Springs Group and four second magnitude springs. The springs on Econfina Creek are concentrated in a long section where the river cuts through the Floridan Aquifer. More than 80% of the normal discharge of Econfina Creek into Deer Point Lake comes from the springs in this part of the river. Public lands The Northwest Florida Water Management District owns most of the land along the river, including in the Econfina Creek Water Management Area. The Water Management Area is also operated as the Econfina Creek Wildlife Management Area by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Paddling trail There is a long designated paddling trail from the Scott Road Bridge to the State Road 388 Bridge. This trail has the steepest fall of any designated canoe trail in Florida. It has been described as \\"the most exciting canoe trail in the state.\\" The Florida Department of Environmental Protection recommends that only experienced paddlers use the upper portion of the trail, and advises that the river is too dangerous for paddling when the water is high following heavy rains. History More than 120 archaeological sites have been identified in the Econfina Creek watershed, including many prehistoric sites. Paleo-Indian arrowheads, about 7,000 years old, have been found at some of the sites. When humans first entered Florida about 12,000 years ago, the water table was much lower, and the course of Econfina Creek was a series of waterholes, and not a flowing river. Choctaw and Creek people lived around Econfina Creek at various times prior the acquisition of Florida by the United States. In the 1830s these people were forced to leave Florida as part of the Trail of Tears. White settlers started moving into the land along Econfina Creek shortly after the United States acquired Florida in 1821. One of the earliest settlers was William Gainer, who was with Andrew Jackson's forces when they passed through the area on their way to Pensacola in 1818 (during the First Seminole War). The bottom land along Econfina Creek was the only place in what is now Bay County that had plantations using slaves. The first cotton shipped from St. Joseph was reported to have come from Econfina. To facilitate this traffic, the Territorial Legislative Council declared Econfina Creek a navigable river up to the Gainer Bridge (built by William Gainer after the natural bridge collapsed). Deer Point Lake Deer Point Lake was created when a dam was constructed across North Bay, part of St. Andrews Bay, in 1961. The reservoir covers . It has a watershed (including Econfina Creek) of . The reservoir receives an average of a day from four sources, and provides fresh water to Panama City and other parts of Bay County. About 60% of the water in the reservoir comes from Econfina Creek. During very dry conditions, Econfina Creek supplies up to 80% of the water flowing into the reservoir.McDonald, Kathleen M. and Steven A. McLellan. \\"Deer Point Reservoir: A Case History of Starting a Watershed Protection Program\\".(.DOC file) Bay County Utility Services.

They established many female nationalist organizations, including the Palestinian Federation of Women's Action Committees in the West Bank and Gaza.Hasso, Frances S. Resistance, Repression, and Gender Politics in Occupied Palestine and Jordan (Syracuse University Press 2005). Despite the change in parental views, however, contemporary women in Palestine are reported to be experiencing adversity due to political discord, Israeli occupation, and the \\"denial of full rights and protection by Palestinian society\\" in general.Palestinian women 'suffer doubly', BBC News, March 31, 2005 One of the main determinants of the role of Palestinian women is the structure of the family which may be a nuclear unit, a transitional unit, or a hamula unit (hamula means \\"extended family\\", the most common family structure in Palestinian society). The significant influences to the rights of women in Palestine include the patriarchal tradition and the teachings of the Quran among Muslim Palestinians or the Bible among Palestinian Christians. On the other hand, female Palestinians were not expected to secure income for the family, but women were expected to adapt to the customary roles of women in Palestinian society. However, females are traditionally equal to men in all aspects. However, there had been a gradual change in the attitudes of parents regarding the education of their Palestinian daughters since the middle of the 1970s. From the middle part of the 1970s, several numbers of Palestinian women achieved education from universities, instead of only receiving education at the secondary level. Reasons for the change of parental attitude were the \\"increased demand for women on the labour market\\", changes in the status of the economy in the West Bank territory, the \\"economic interests\\" of the parents, and the idea that a well-educated Palestinian woman has a better place and opportunity on the \\"marriage market\\". In addition to this, armed with earned education, an unmarried daughter can financially support herself and her parents.Manasra, Najah. Palestinian Women: Between Tradition and Revolution A survey by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics from 2011 showed that 35 percent of married women in Gaza had been on the receiving end of physical violence by their husband during the previous twelve months, and that 40 percent of unmarried women had been physically abused by a member of their household. In 2013, UNRWA canceled its annual marathon in Gaza after Hamas rulers prohibited women, including Palestinian women from Gaza, to participate in the race.  History  fr), 1929 There was a shift in that social order in 1844 when women first participated alongside men in protesting against the first Jewish settlements near the town of Afulah. Between 1900 and 1910, as the region of Palestine (which included what is now Jordan) was under Ottoman rule, Arab women initiated the creation of numerous associations and societies. These organizations were formed mostly in the larger cities, and especially in cities with large Christian populations such as Jaffa, Jerusalem, Haifa, and Acre. In 1917, they took part in large demonstrations at the time of the Balfour Declaration, and later formed a 14-member delegation that demanded that the Balfour Declaration be revoked and that Jewish immigration to Palestine be halted. In 1921, Palestinian women organized by setting up their own society known as the Arab Women's Association, (fr) based in Jerusalem. The society organized demonstrations against the Palestinian Jewish settlements. Due to the lack of funding and the social and political pressure which was put on the women of the Arab Women's Association, the group ceased to exist after two years. Women formed a 'rescue committee' to collect donations in order to revive it. In the 1929 Palestine riots, women took part in multiple protests and demonstrations which resulted in women being killed by the British Mandate forces. They organized a Women's Conference, where they sent out a protest letter to King George V and to the League of Nations. Following the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, the participation of Palestinian women in opposition was almost non-existent due to a strict social order in society at the time. The displacement and loss of land for the Palestinians created an economic issue. This created a demand for women in the workforce despite the social restrictions.Kazi, Hamida. \\"Palestinian Women and the National Liberation Movement: A Social Perspective.\\" N.p., 13 Nov. 2013. Web. Following the establishment of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1964, helped create the sect known as the Palestinian Women‚Äôs Association, which allowed women to take part in the first session of the Palestinian National Council that was held in Jerusalem.  Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict  The Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict has seriously affected the Palestinian women. Hundreds of thousands of women were banished and displaced from their homelands after the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, and more during the 1967 War such as poet May Sayegh. The majority of them and their descendants are still refugees. Many measures taken by the Israel Defense Force (IDF) have affected the Palestinian women's physical, psychological, health, education, economic security. A press release issued by the Ma'an News Agency in 2007 reported that many women suffered psychological and sexual violence at the Israeli checkpoint in Beit Safafa. These cases reported forced strip searches under the pretext of security measures.  Women's rights in Palestine  In November 2019, the PA government raised the minimum marriage age to 18 for both genders in an effort to reduce rates of early marriage. Previously, the minimum age for marriage in the West Bank was 15 for females and 16 for males, while in the Gaza Strip it was 17 for females and 18 for males. Judges had the power to approve an earlier marriage. According to statistics, 37% of married Palestinian females married when they were under the age of 18, including 5% who married before the age of 15. 63% of young married women suffer violence at the hands of their husband, and 95% would not recommend early marriage for their daughters. Child marriage is thought to contribute to the high rate of divorce in the Palestinian territories, where 67% of women who divorced in 2018 were aged 18 to 29. PA outlaws child marriage Divorce rights for women depend on the personal status laws that apply to Muslims, which state that a man can divorce his wife for any reason, while women can request divorce only under certain circumstances. If a woman proceeds to a divorce she does not need to present any evidence, but would give up any financial rights and must return her dowry. The Ministry of Women's Affairs in Palestine, established in 2003, is the main governmental agency responsible for promoting and protecting women's rights. Government ministries promote reform of discriminatory laws and gender units have been established in each ministry. In March 2018, the PA repealed its marry-your- rapist law, a provision that allowed an accused rapist to evade punishment by marrying his victim. However, because the Gaza Strip is de facto controlled by Hamas, the Egyptian-derived marry-your-rapist law still applies there. Education of the girl Since the mid-1970s, families have been moving towards educating their daughters highly and enrolling them in universities rather than just getting a high school diploma. The reason for this change is that women are becoming needed in the labor market, changing the economic situation in the West Bank. The idea that an educated young woman is desirable for marriage is firmly established. Finally, the young woman is able to afford her expenses and the expenses of her family in the event of her marriage.

In the majors, he compiled a .234 batting average with 18 runs scored, 47 hits, nine doubles, two triples, one home run, and 22 runs batted in (RBIs) in 60 games played. He played all of his Major League games at third base. Kores played the majority of his career in the minor leagues with the Des Moines Boosters (1911‚Äì1912), Portland Beavers (1913‚Äì1914), Rochester Hustlers (1915), Nashville Volunteers (1916‚Äì1917), Louisville Colonels (1918), Toledo Mud Hens (1920), and Indianapolis Indians (1920). In the minors, he compiled a career .274 batting average with 1,225 hits, 212 doubles, 91 triples, and 29 home runs in 1,243 games played. Kores batted and threw right-handed. During his playing career, he stood at and weighed . Early life Kores was born on July 22, 1886 in Milwaukee to John and Theresa Kores, both of Bohemia. John Kores worked as a cabinet maker. Art Kores had five siblings; sisters Cecilia, and Josephine; and brothers Chas, Fred, and Joseph. Art Kores played semi-professional baseball, and sandlot ball in Milwaukee, before turning professional. Professional career Kores' professional baseball career began in 1910 with the Racine Belles of the Class-C Wisconsin‚ÄìIllinois League. He played just a month and a half with the Racine club, being used as a first baseman. Kores spent his first full professional season with the Des Moines Boosters of the Class-A Western League in 1911. With the Boosters, he batted .215 with 127 hits, 17 doubles, nine triples, and four home runs in 161 games played. Defensively, he played all of his games as a third baseman. After the season, Des Moines general manager Jack Holland attempted to trade Kores to another team, but no organization showed interest. Kores played for the Portland Beavers for two seasons (1913‚Äì14). The day before the Des Moines Boosters opening series of the 1912 season, Kores signed a new contract with the team. In his season debut, on April 19, Kores got three hits. With Des Moines that year, he batted .298 with 182 hits, 25 doubles, 10 triples, and 10 home runs in 162 games played. In the field, he played shortstop, committing 60 errors in 674 total chances. At the end of the 1912 season, the Portland Beavers of the Double-A Pacific Coast League drafted Kores from the Boosters. He was later drafted by the Chicago Cubs, but passed up the opportunity to play in Major League Baseball (MLB). On March 1, 1913, Kores joined the Portland Beavers at their spring training camp in Visalia, California. He played 165 games with Portland that season, batting .282 with 24 doubles, eight triples, and five home runs. In the field, Kores played shortstop. At the start of the 1914 season, Kores was moved from shortstop to third base. During the season, The Milwaukee Journal described Kores as \\"the best clean-up hitter in the Coast league\\". With the Beavers that year, he batted .296 with 54 doubles, 21 triples, and five home runs in 187 games played. He led the Pacific Coast League in doubles, and triples that season. Kores was also third in the league in runs batted in (RBIs) with 94 that season. In September, 1914, the New York Giants drafted Kores from the Portland Beavers in what the Oakland Tribune a \\"secret lottery\\". Kores rejected the Giants contract offer, stating that he could make as much money in the Pacific Coast League then he could in the majors. He demanded a US$2,100 a year salary from the Giants, which New York declined to give him. He eventually signed a contract with the Giants for an undisclosed amount. According to Beavers officials, Kores, who told the Giants he was only 23 years old, had to confess his real age to get the contract. Before the 1915 season, it was reported that the St. Louis Terriers of the Federal League were interested in Kores, whose contract was owned by the New York Giants. At the start of the regular season, Giants manager John McGraw offered Kores' contract back to the Portland Beavers for a price of US$2,500, but Beavers manager Judge McCredie declined. Instead, McGraw sent Kores to the Double-A Rochester Hustlers of the International League. In 75 games with Rochester that year, he batted .275 with 76 hits, 11 doubles, 11 triples, and two home runs. On July 23, it was reported that Kores had left the Hustlers to join the Major League St. Louis Terriers. As a result, the Rochester club suspended him and fined him US$250. Officials from the Hustlers said that it did not come as a surprise that Kores had left the team, because he was in talks with the St. Louis club for months. Kores made his MLB debut on July 24, 1915. With St. Louis that season, he batted .234 with 18 runs scored, 47 hits, nine doubles, seven triples, one home run, and 22 RBIs in 60 games played. In the field, he played all of his games at third base, committing 10 errors in 251 total chances. In 1916, the Federal League dissolved and the St. Louis Browns of the American League took over their operations. The Browns then sold Kores to the Class-A Nashville Volunteers of the Southern Association. With Nashville that season, he batted .275 with 117 hits, 21 doubles, and seven triples in 129 games played. In the field, he played third base. Kores re- signed with the Nashville Volunteers in 1917. That year, he batted .275 with 152 hits, 30 doubles, 13 triples, and two home runs in 154 games played. Defensively, he played all of his games at third base, committing 27 errors in 583 total chances. After the season, Kores joined a barnstorming team in Milwaukee. Before the start of the 1918 season, Kores was sold from the Nashville Volunteers to the Louisville Colonels of the Double-A American Association. With Louisville, he batted .304 with 78 hits, 10 doubles, and seven triples in 71 games played. He played third base for the Colonels that season. After he completed his season with the Colonels, Kores signed with the semi-professional Lake Shore League. In 1919, he continued to play semi-pro baseball. He also injured his right arm that season. In late-March during the 1920 season, Kores signed with the Double-A Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association. Later that season, he joined the Indianapolis Indians, who were also members of the American Association. Between the two clubs, he batted .253 with 123 hits, 20 doubles, five triples, and one home run in 139 games played. He played all of his games at third base, committing 25 errors in 435 games played.

About a year later, traps and a temporary hatchery were built. By the spring of 1928, they had 30 troughs for the 208,000 Coho salmon and 1,400,000 steelhead eggs collected. The constant stream of fresh water needed was delivered through 12-inch flume that was nearly 2,500 feet long from behind a dam on Lost Man Creek. The early success of the temporary hatchery resulted in the continuation of the hatchery experiment during the early 1930s and hatchery steelhead, cutthroat trout, Coho salmon, and King salmon, were released to the wild. The site of the temporary hatchery was abandoned and the present hatchery was completely rebuilt in 1936 on approximately the same footprint as the 62-acre historic district with the five buildings and seven contributing structures recognized today: the hatchery, superintendent's house, assistant's house, sidewalks, garage shop, shed, pipeline stream crossing, and four of the round outdoor water tanks. The fifth tank was added later. Several buildings were reworked and removed over the time of operation and the dam and reservoir were removed in 1989. The hatchery continued production of trout and salmon during the 1940s, but as the water supply deteriorated as mechanized logging increased following World War II. Humboldt County began operating the hatchery in 1957. The property was conveyed to Humboldt County by the California State Assembly on 15 September 1961 and continued operation until 31 October 1992. Indomitable salmon The sculpture of the Indomitable salmon, installed March 5, 1974 at the Prairie Creek Fish Hatchery, currently outside Buck's of Woodside restaurant in San Mateo County, California. On 2 December 1964, Hatchery Superintendent Ken Johnson found a 2-year-old marked coho salmon swimming in a tank of newborn fish, exactly where he had been raised two years earlier. To reach the tank, he had to travel from the Pacific Ocean up Redwood Creek, turn into Lost Man Creek, run up a ditch, through a culvert under Highway 101, through a storm sewer, and up the hatchery waste water through a drainage pipe, making a 90 degree turn and a vertical jump inside the pipe. Finally, he rammed through an overhead wire mesh screen, probably by jumping, to get into the rearing pond. The fish was rapidly nicknamed Indomitable by the local press. Looking for how he got into the tank, workers found 72 more marked coho jack salmon of the same age class stuck in the flume or drainage pipe on the way to the hatchling pond. The story of Indomitable received massive press coverage, inspired a book, and continues to be cited as one of the amazing feats of animal migration. From 1974 to 1992 two large redwood sculptures of Indomitable were sequentially mounted outside the hatchery. The first, a , two-ton sculpture by Floyd Davis of Gasquet, California was made and installed in 1974 after fundraising efforts by System 99 Vice-President Ed Henke. In 1992, this sculpture was judged too weathered to be displayed. Following donations by Arcata Redwood Company, Miller Farms Saw Shop and Humboldt County Supervisor, Anna Sparks, the second fish was carved on site by Mark Leppanen of Arcata. When the Hatchery was closed on 31 October 1992, the second sculpture was removed and stored at the Arcata/Eureka airport until 14 October 1997 when the Humboldt County Board of Supervisors sold it to the North Coast Co-op grocery store in Arcata for $5,005 and displayed inside the store. Still at Prairie Creek are Indomitable's mounting pole, concrete pad and dedication marker. The original Davis sculpture was sold by the Humboldt County Board of Supervisors and is currently installed outside Buck's of Woodside restaurant.

The high school students come from schools in Marion, Morrow and Union counties. The Adult Education Center has become a regional campus that partners with area businesses to provide lifelong, continuous training programs in computer, health, industrial and public safety fields. History Dr. Robert Burton was hired to spearhead the funding effort for a proposed vocational school district in 1972.from official tri- rivers website history page Originally called GATEWAY, the proposed district would have included all of Crawford, Morrow, Wyandot, Marion and Delaware counties. After an unsuccessful levy effort, the proposed size was revised and Crawford and Delaware counties, along with the Northmor District of Morrow County, were dropped. A.O. Gross, Marion County Superintendent of Schools, served as an interim acting superintendent to head up a levy campaign featuring the revised district. Voters approved this levy in 1974. As part of the revised planning, Crawford and Delaware counties, along with the Northmor district in Morrow County, were removed from the vocational district. Construction began shortly after the levy approval, and the doors to Tri- Rivers opened in August 1976. Charles Giauque, who was the County Superintendent for Knox County, was hired as the first Superintendent of the newly created district. Upper Sandusky was also assigned by the State School Board to be part of the district. In addition, students from Carey attended through tuition payments in the early years. Eventually, they became part of another district. Giauque served as superintendent until his retirement in 1983. Dr. Robert Ludwig was hired and served until 1988 when Jim Craycraft began his tenure. Mr. Craycraft retired in 2002 and was replaced by Dr. Charles Barr, superintendent of Wynford Local Schools. Dr. Barr retired in 2007. Chuck Speelman, former superintendent for Shelby Schools is the current superintendent. In 1985, a change in focus was recognized when the name of the facility was changed to Tri-Rivers Career Center and Tri-Rivers Center for Adult Education. This change was made to reflect the emphasis on career preparation for high school as well as adult students. Name The name ‚ÄúTri-Rivers‚Äù originated from the three rivers within the district: the Scioto, Sandusky and Olentangy. The logo featuring three incoming white arrows intertwined with three outgoing blue arrows symbolizes the incoming untrained students and outgoing skilled employees. The Adult Center was the first Career Center in Ohio and possibly the nation, to offer an LPN to RN Transitions program. Tri-Rivers‚Äô flag features interconnecting circles to indicate the collaboration needed to meet the goals of the entire Career Center. The triangular loop represents the three rivers, three counties in the district, and the three components of its programming: adult, secondary and community center.from official tri-rivers website history page The 10 stars represent the 10 associate schools of the district.

Mexico refused to follow the Anglo-French non-intervention proposals. President L√°zaro C√°rdenas saw the war as similar to Mexico's own revolution, although a large part of Mexican society wanted a Nationalist victory. Mexico's attitude gave immense moral comfort to the Republic, especially since the major Latin American governments‚Äîthose of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru‚Äîsympathized more or less openly with the Nationalists. But Mexican aid could mean relatively little in practical terms if the French border were closed and if Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy remained free to supply the Nationalists with a quality and quantity of weapons far beyond the power of Mexico. Mexico furnished $2,000,000 in aid and provided some material assistance, which included a small number of American-made aircraft such as the Bellanca CH-300 and Spartan Zeus that had previously served in the Mexican Air Force. Not all of these aircraft reached the Republicans. Soviet Union Union of Soviet Socialist Republics The Soviet Union primarily provided material assistance to the Republican forces. In total the USSR provided Spain with 806 planes, 362 tanks, and 1,555 artillery pieces.Academy of Sciences of the USSR, International Solidarity with the Spanish Republic, 1936‚Äì1939 (Moscow: Progress, 1974), 329‚Äì30 The Soviet Union ignored the League of Nations embargo and sold arms to the Republic when few other nations would do so; thus it was the Republic's only important source of major weapons. Joseph Stalin had signed the Non-Intervention Agreement but decided to break the pact. However, unlike Hitler and Mussolini who openly violated the pact, Stalin tried to do so secretly.Arms for Spain Gerald Howson He created a section X of the Soviet Union military to head the operation, coined Operation X. However, while a new branch of the military was created especially for Spain, most of the weapons and artillery sent to Spain were antiques. Stalin also used weapons captured in past conflicts.Beevor (2006). pp. 152‚Äì53. However, modern weapons such as BT-5 tanksBeevor (2006). p. 153. and I-16 fighter aircraft were also supplied to Spain. Many of the Soviet deliveries were lost, or were smaller than Stalin had ordered. He only gave short notice, which meant many weapons were lost in the delivery process. Lastly, when the ships did leave with supplies for the Republicans, the journey was extremely slow. Stalin ordered the builders to include false decks in the design of ships. Then, once the ship left shore it was required to change its flag and change the color of parts of the ship to avoid capture by the Nationalists. However, in 1938, Stalin withdrew his troops and tanks as Republican government policy floundered. Historian Hugh Thomas comments \\"had they been able to purchase and transport good arms from US, British, and French manufacturers, the socialist and republican members of the Spanish government might have tried to cut themselves loose from Stalin\\".Thomas (2003) p. 683. The Republic paid for Soviet arms with the gold reserves of the Bank of Spain, in an affair that would become a frequent subject of Francoist propaganda afterward (see Moscow Gold). The cost of Soviet arms was more than US $500 million (in 1936 prices); 72% of Spain's gold reserve, the fourth-largest in the world. The remaining 27%, or 176 tonnes, was transferred to France.Beevor (2006). pp. 153‚Äì54. The Soviet Union also sent a number of military advisers to Spain (2,000Beevor (2006). p. 163.‚Äì3,000Graham, Helen. The Spanish Civil War. A very short introduction. Oxford University Press. New York. 2005. p. 92).Thomas (2003). p. 944. While Soviet troops amounted to no more than 500 men at a time, Soviet volunteers often operated Soviet-made Republican tanks and aircraft, particularly at the beginning of the war.Thomas (1961). p. 637. In addition, the Soviet Union directed Communist parties around the world to organize and recruit the International Brigades. Another significant Soviet involvement was the pervasive activity of the NKVD all along the Republican rearguard. Communist figures like Vittorio Vidali (\\"Comandante Contreras\\"), Iosif Grigulevich and, above all, Alexander Orlov led those not-so-secret operations, that included murders like those of Andreu Nin and Jos√© Robles. Ambivalent support=France French Republic The French position towards the Spanish Republic was characterized by its hesitant attitude and its ambivalence. Thus the government of France did not send direct support to the Spanish Republicans and towards the end of the beleaguered republic ended up turning against it, instead recognizing the Francoist State. President Albert Lebrun opposed direct assistance, but the left-wing government of French Prime Minister L√©on Blum was sympathetic to the Republic.Antony Beevor, The Battle for Spain. Orion. (1982 revised 2006). Blum considered both sending military aid and technology to the Republicans including aircraft and utilizing the French Navy to blockade the Franco-led Spanish Army of Africa from crossing from Spanish Morocco to Spain.Michael Alpert (1994). A New International History of the Spanish Civil War. Hampshire and London, England: MacMillan Press; New York: St. Martin‚Äôs Press, p. 14. Also upon the outbreak of civil war the Spanish Republican government and the government of France in diplomatic messages discussed a potential transfer of French aircraft to Spanish Republican forces. The Blum government feared that the success of Francoist forces in Spain would result in the creation of an ally state of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy that would allow German and Italian military forces to be based in the Canary and Balearic Islands. Right-wing politicians, however, heard of the French government's intention to send military support to the Spanish Republicans in the war and opposed the French government's actions by means of a vicious campaign against the Blum government for its alleged support of the Republicans.Michael Alpert (1994). A New International History of the Spanish Civil War. Hampshire and London: MacMillan Press; New York: St. Martin‚Äôs Press. pp. 14‚Äì15. On 27 July 1936, British officials had discussed with Prime Minister Blum their position on the war and convinced Blum not to send arms to the Republicans.Michael Alpert (1994). A New International History of the Spanish Civil War. Hampshire and London: MacMillan Press; New York: St. Martin‚Äôs Press. p. 20. Therefore, on 27 July, the French government declared that it would not send military aid, technology, or forces.Michael Alpert. A New International History of the Spanish Civil War. Hampshire and London, England, UK: MACMILLAN PRESS, LTD; New York, New York, USA: ST. MARTIN'S PRESS, INC, 1994. Pp. 23. However Blum made clear that France reserved the right to provide aid should it wish, and indicated also indicated his support for the Republic, saying: On 1 August 1936, a pro-Republican rally of 20,000 people confronted Blum demanding that he send aircraft to the Spanish Republicans at the same time as right-wing politicians attacked Blum for supporting the Republic and being responsible for provoking Fascist Italian intervention on the side of Franco. Nazi Germany informed the French ambassador in Berlin that Germany would hold France responsible if it supported what it described as \\"the maneuvers of Moscow\\" by supporting the Spanish Republicans.Michael Alpert. A New International History of the Spanish Civil War. Hampshire and London, England, UK: MACMILLAN PRESS, LTD; New York, New York, USA: ST. MARTIN'S PRESS, INC, 1994. Pp. 43. Finally, on 21 August 1936, France, the UK, and Italy (under pressure from both France and the UK) signed the Non-Intervention proposals involving the Spanish Civil War. However, the Blum government provided military assistance to the Spanish Republicans through covert means by supplying obsolete Potez 54, Dewoitine and Loire 46 aircraft to the Spanish Republican Air Force from 7 August 1936 to December of that year.Michael Alpert. A New International History of the Spanish Civil War. Hampshire and London, England, UK: MACMILLAN PRESS, LTD; New York, New York, USA: ST. MARTIN'S PRESS, INC, 1994. Pp. 46-47. Often with their weapons removed, these almost useless and vulnerable planes rarely survived three months of air missions.Air Aces - Semyon Desnitsky Also, until 8 September 1936, aircraft could freely pass from France into Spain if they were bought in other countries.Michael Alpert. A New International History of the Spanish Civil War. Hampshire and London, England, UK: MACMILLAN PRESS, LTD; New York, New York, USA: ST. MARTIN'S PRESS, INC, 1994. Pp. 47. Although the half-hearted and largely ineffective support by France to the Republicans ended in December 1936, German intelligence reported to Franco and his faction that the French military was engaging in open discussions about intervention in the war.Stanley G. Payne. Franco and Hitler: Spain, Germany, and World War II. Yale University Press, 2008. p. 28. Allegedly in 1938 Franco feared an immediate French intervention against a potential Francoist victory in Spain through French occupation of Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and Spanish Morocco.Igor Luke≈°, Erik Goldstein (1999). The Munich crisis, 1938: prelude to World War II. London & Portland, OR: Frank Cass. p. 176. Towards the end of the Civil War, most seagoing vessels of the Spanish Republican Navy were evacuated to Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia where the fleet was impounded by the French authorities and later handed over to the Francoist faction.Thomas, Hugh. The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. 2001.

He resides in Florida and initially attempted to run for President as a Republican in 2012. On August 24, 2011, he formally ended his presidential campaign. Background Sharkey was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey and joined the United States Army in 1981. Following his discharge on medical grounds in 1983, he studied at Kansas State University. He formerly lived in Minnesota but moved to Florida in 2010. Sharkey has three living children, and a fourth child who is now deceased. A drummer since the age of 5, as well as a guitarist, Sharkey is endorsed by Soultone Cymbals, and has recorded an album of Elvis Presley cover songs. He has also appeared in several films, both as an actor and as a soundtrack composer. Wrestling career Originally a boxer, Sharkey began wrestling in 1988. He began his career with Larry Sharpe's WWA promotion, facing \\"Diamond Jim\\" Brady in a boxer vs. wrestler match. Following this, he worked with a number of other wrestling promoters including Rocky Johnson, father of Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson. He cites his greatest wrestling influences as Ric Flair and Ricky Steamboat. Beliefs and vampirism Sharkey says he first drank blood at age five and now consumes the blood of his girlfriends and mistresses twice a week. He has described his vampirism as \\"a very healthy thing to do\\" and has praised Hollywood for making vampire feeding practices \\"romantic and erotic\\". He drinks only women's blood because \\"women are beautiful... they have such beautiful necks and arms\\". He says he is well known within the vampire community, and says he drinks cow and pig blood. Sharkey is a Luciferian who \\"turned against God\\" because he would not worship a God who \\"caused the deaths of innocent children\\" and \\"allowed his only son to be used as a sacrifice on the cross\\". He compares Lucifer to the Founding Fathers of the United States, arguing that they both exemplify the idea of rebellion against tyranny. He says he doesn't hate Jesus, just God the Father, and that he follows the goddess Hecate in addition to Lucifer. Political positions He has described his policy on crime as follows: \\"Certain criminals, instead of being put in jail, they should be brutally tortured and impaled.... Upon them being found guilty of their crimes I'll beat them, torture them, dismember them and decapitate them.\\" In an appearance on Tucker Carlson's television show, he agreed with the host's description of him as \\"not simply a vampire, [but] a right-wing vampire\\" and said his policy for dealing with drug dealers is to \\"go to Sicilian families and have them attack the drug dealers for me\\". Sharkey strongly criticized President George W. Bush, whom he described as a \\"wuss\\" and a communist who was responsible for the deaths of innocent Americans in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. He has expressed a desire to try, and convict, and impale Bush, and has since said that \\"Obama is even worse than Bush, and I never thought anyone could be worse than Bush. He has no idea how to run a country, nor should he be running a country.\\" Sharkey once served on the Hillsborough County, Florida Republican Party's Executive Committee. A. J. Matthews, who also serves on the committee, has described Sharkey as someone who believes in \\"Republican values\\" but said that Sharkey needs to focus on campaign issues rather than \\"extreme behaviors\\". Sharkey says that he would ban abortion and the teaching of evolution in public schools. On other social issues, he leans libertarian; he supports equal rights for gays. He opposes President Obama's health care reform and said that he would replace it with a plan of his own in which the poor would receive free medical and dental care; the expenses would be paid with government taxes on marijuana and prostitution, which Sharkey supports legalizing and regulating. On foreign policy, he wishes to bring American troops home from foreign war zones. In keeping with his belief in the goddess Hecate, he supports environmentalism and \\"protecting Mother Earth\\". He said that his ideal running mate would be former New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman. During the 2012 election, he criticized Republican rival Michele Bachmann as \\"too flakey for me\\". Political campaigns Sharkey has filed with the Federal Election Commission to run for President of the United States twice as an Independent candidate (in 2004 and in 2008) and once as a Republican candidate (in 2012). He has run for Congress in at least three states‚Äîhis home State of New Jersey (1999‚Äì2000, Republican), Indiana (Reform Party, 2000) and Florida (2001‚Äì02, Republican). In 2006, he ran for governor of Minnesota.Sharkey's defunct website related to his run for Governor of Minnesota (archived): home page, agenda Legal troubles Sharkey was investigated by the United States Secret Service for threatening to impale President George W. Bush. Agents visited Sharkey at his home for questioning. A spokesman for the Secret Service said that he didn't believe the investigation was an overreaction. He has also been jailed in Tennessee for making threats against an Indiana judge. Investigators confiscated two rifles and a wooden stake with spikes at his house. While in Tennessee he had reportedly attempted to set up a colony for vampires. He has also been accused of \\"brainwashing\\" a 16-year-old girl in Minnesota, whose family now has a restraining order against him, and has admitted to harassing another 16-year- old Minnesota girl online. Sharkey's 2006 bid for Minnesota governor was cut short after Sharkey was arrested by Minnesota police on an outstanding Indiana arrest warrant, sent to Mille Lacs County jail and extradited to Indiana.Dregni, Eric (2006). Weird Minnesota: your travel guide to Minnesota's local legends and best kept secrets Sterling. pg. 99. In 2010, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children issued an alert after a 16-year-old girl, Paige Brewer, from Faribault, Minnesota ran away with Sharkey. The alert described Brewer as an \\"endangered runaway\\". Brewer's mother eventually won a court order keeping Sharkey away from her daughter, who was taken into custody by police and returned home.

Category 3 carcinogens are defined as substances that have possible carcinogenic effects in humans but about which there is insufficient information to make an assessment. Substances are most often categorised as category 1 carcinogens by epidemiological data and as category 2 or 3 carcinogens through the results of animal testing. Mixtures containing more than 0.1% of a category 1 or 2 carcinogen or more than 1% of a category 3 carcinogen must also be considered carcinogenic and be appropriately labelled.Safe Work Australia , NOHSC.

Last accessed 21/05/2011 Many carcinogens are used in industry and everyday life, making the safe handling of carcinogens an important consideration.  Routes of exposure  The main routes of exposure to carcinogens come from direct contact through the methods of inhalation, contact, injection, absorption or ingestion. Each of these exposure routes and severity of damage can vary depending on the potential carcinogen in question.Health Canada , Health Canada. (2006). Carcinogens, Mutagens, Teratogens and Reproductive Toxins. Available: http://hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/occup-travail/whmis- simdut/carcino-eng.php. Last accessed 26/04/2011.

These include:  Elimination  Ideally carcinogenic substances should be avoided by substitution with less hazardous substances. Alternate form of carcinogenic substances may also be used to minimise the risk of exposure. In the case of carcinogens which pose a danger through inhalation, pastes or pellets can be used to avoid the possibility of airborne dust. Volatile liquids can also potentially be substituted with paste forms to avoid excessive formation of vapours.  Equipment design  Standard containment devices such as fume hoods, glove boxes, use of high efficiency particular air (HEPA) filters, ventilated containment or weighing, or placing the carcinogenic substance in a sealed weighed container (Tare Method). The employment of these methods and equipment can help reduce the unnecessary exposure to the carcinogens. Special care must be taken when using single exposure carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.Society of Toxicology, http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/2/169.full.pdf The single exposure carcinogen database: Assessing the circumstances under which a Single Exposure to a Carcinogen can cause cancer. Toxicological Sciences 50, 169-185 (1999) published by The Society of Toxicology.. All surfaces where carcinogens are used must be of a suitable material, e.g.: stainless steel, plastic trays or absorbent plastic backed paper. Correct signs must be placed outside of the work stating 'No eating, drinking or smoking' and 'Danger carcinogen in use. Authorised personnel only'.Radford University, Radford University.

Accident procedures  A quick response to an accident or spill can greatly reduce exposure to a carcinogenic substance. If a spill or accident occurs ensure that the contaminated materials are disposed of in the correct hazardous waste bin(ensure stained clothing is removed immediately), a correct spill kit is used on the spill, in the case of a liquid spill, ensure that the spill is cleaned as soon as possible to prevent the formation of aerosols, have employees tested for exposure to carcinogens, refer to MSDS for specific treatment or dangers. Prepare spill kits and emergency plans prior to beginning use of the carcinogenic substances and in the case of a large spill vacate the area and call for assistance.  Personal protective equipment  The correct personal protective equipment must be worn when handling carcinogens. Ensure safety goggles, impermeable gloves (of an appropriate material), respirator (if appropriate), face shield, impermeable apron, closed toed shoes, long sleeved lab coat are worn. Disposable aprons and lab coats are preferable to reduce risks of repeated exposure.The Stanford University, Stanford University Laboratory Chemical Safety Toolkit Environmental Health and Safety \\"General Use SOP for Carcinogens\\".  Storage  The correct storage of carcinogens is important in reducing exposure. Limit access to carcinogens, keep containers and amounts used as small as possible, double containers and chemical resistant trays. Store in a designated area with the appropriate hazard signs and ventilation if required. The carcinogens should be stored in a separate area to flammable solids and corrosive liquids as to avoid any damage to containers and possible leaking of carcinogenic compounds. By Australian law, carcinogens must also be properly labelled when stored. Category 1 or 2 carcinogens or mixtures containing above 0.1% of such substances must be labelled either with the risk phrase \\"R49 May cause cancer by inhalation\\", if the risk of carcinogenic effects is only present when the substance's dust or vapours are inhaled. Otherwise, the risk phrase \\"R45 May cause cancer\\" is used. Category 3 carcinogens or mixtures containing above 1% of a category 3 carcinogens must be labelled with the risk phrase \\"R40 Possible risks of irreversible effects\\".Safe Work Australia , NOHSC.

Personnel must wash hands and arms with soap and water, immediately after handling. If exposure occurs, contact emergency health services and use safety shower/eye wash station. Decontamination of area procedures vary depending on the material being handled. Toxicity of some materials can be neutralised with other agents (refer to the MSDS for appropriate action).

(1977). Introduction. In Marx, K. (1977). Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Volume One. New York: Vintage Books, p. 55. Prior to centralized manufacturing, individuals specialized in the production of one product, trading their final product for final products made by other individuals. This can refer to specialized trades within a community, such as master sewers, blacksmiths, farmers, etc., or also the specializations of whole communities in contact with each other, such as one community making clothes, one making tools, and another producing food, which they exchange. Social division of labor greatly increases productivity, because individuals can produce the product in which they have a comparative advantage, and trade it to the individuals who cannot efficiently produce it for the products they need. The social division of labor creates exchange market and prices, by comparing the cost and time of making each product. Social division of labor can be advantageous; however, too much specialization can be disadvantageous due to three main reasons. If a community specializes on a product too much, the community will become dependent on the success of their product and will endure an economic disaster if their product becomes replaced or goes extinct. For example, if bananas go extinct or grow under bad seasonal conditions in a country such as Ecuador, the economy will suffer along with the whole community. Another case in which too much specialization could backfire is if all communities relied on one community to produce a certain product, because then the community would have a monopoly on that product and would have the ability to withhold production for their own greater benefit. A final problem is that individual workers who specialize in highly specific occupational skill-sets are vulnerable to economic reorganization associated with volatile 'product cycles' and developments of new industries where representation in union constituencies may change (e.g., financial services) over older, outsourced or automated ones (e.g., weaving).Silver, B. J. (2003). Forces of Labor: Workers Movements and Globalization Since 1870. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Marxists argue that capitalism, and modes of production in general, change through revolutions in the means of production, which produce unemployed workers over- specializing in niche occupations, and hence, cannot enter the labour force to solve spiraling unemployment problems when these disappear.Yates, M.

Situated on the northern coast, it was south west of Rabaul. The airfield was constructed by the Imperial Japanese in World War II during September 1943. Kerevat Airfield was neutralized by Allied Powers' air bombing from 1944, who ran missions on the airfield between June 20, 1943, and May 16, 1944. The airfield was abandoned after the cessation of hostilities; however, the airstrip is still visible. Structure The airfield's single runway was located on Ataliklikun Bay east of Vunakanauwas. The runway was long and wide and ran parallel to the Keravat River in an east‚Äìwest direction, to the southwest of Rabaul. It was not an all-weather concrete runway. Though the runway was upgraded, it was never fully operational, and its use was limited to crash landing as the airstrip, riddled with problems, was generally subject to drainage and other engineering problems, making it difficult for use for regular flight operations. World War II history The 552nd K≈çk≈´tai (D3A2 Val) unit was stationed here from December 18, 1943, to January 25, 1944. There were nine bombings of the airfield during the period June 20, 1943, to May 16, 1944, by American missions; these bombings were on June 20, 1943, by 13th Air Force B-24s; on February 22, 1944, by 13th AF B-24s, with fighter escorts; on February 23, 1944, by ten 13th AF B-25s; April 17, 1944, by ten 13th AF fighter bombers, that pounded the runway; April 18, 1944, twelve 13th AF B-25 and nine fighter-bombers which failed to bomb Rapopo, instead bombing the airstrip at Keravat; April 20, 1944, by forty 13th AF fighter bombers; April 22, 1944, by 13th AF B-25s; and on May 10, 1944, by 13th AF fighters on a sweep, which hit trucks; and on May 16, 1944, by 13th AF fighter bombers which hit trucks and a saw mill was also damaged. The five airports that provided umbrella type defense to the Rabaul airport and the capital town, the stronghold of the Japanese forces during the war, were Kerevat, Lakuani, Vunakanau and Tobera; all of them were frequently bombed by allied forces. Two ‚ÄúFlying Nightmares‚Äù PBJ-1s bombed Kerevat and the other airports with 100-pound bombs so that Japanese fighters could not use them.

Garcinia hanburyi is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree (up to approximately 15 m in height) with smooth grey bark. It is native to Cambodia, southern Vietnam, and Thailand and has been successfully introduced in Singapore. Original uses Gambogic acid is the principal pigment of gambooge resin which, in addition to early traditional medicinal uses in Southeast Asia, is also a sought after dye due to the bright orange color it imparts to cloth. According to traditional Chinese medical documentation, gamboge was described as poisonous and acidic and possessed the ability to detoxify, kill parasites, and stop bleeding as a hemostatic agent. Gambogic acid has also been used in various food preparations in Asian cultures. Research Some pharmacological research on gambogic acid has been conducted in vitro and in laboratory animals, but there are no proven clinical effects in humans. Effects on tumor growth in mice In studies conducted with mice and transplanted tumors (from human lung carcinoma SPC-A1 cells), tumor growth remained suppressed for up to 21 days during treatment with gambogic acid. The ratio of relative tumor volume (RTV) for the treated group of mice to the control group indicates the gambogic acid was having an impact on tumor size while having no adverse effects on body weight or mortality. Tumor volume was measured twice each week during the study, and the ratio of treated to control group tumor volume ranged from 45.0% to 72.7% for the 8 mg/kg dose and from 55.6% to 78.8% for the 4 mg/kg dose. Tumor growth rate shows a dependence on the dose of gambogic acid, with the 8 mg/kg dose providing improved results at suppressing tumor growth in these trials. In 2007, a research project focused on the mechanisms involved with gambogic acid's antitumor activity. Results supported the hypothesis that gambogic acid works to suppress nuclear factor-Œ∫Œí (NF-Œ∫Œí) activation that is induced by various inflammatory agents and carcinogens. In multiple myeloma, osteoclastogenesis is very common in which patients suffer from weakening of the bones. Gambogic acid inhibits such osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting CXCR4 signaling pathways. Gambogic acid has also been found to bind to transferrin receptor1 (TfR) and rapidly induce cell apoptosis without competing with the transferrin (Tf) binding site. A brief exposure to this compound resulted in a rapid start to apoptosis, including membrane blebbing within 15 minutes. Effects on cell growth The effect of gambogic acid on the growth of SPC-A1 cells was also investigated. Cells were cultured with various concentrations of gambogic acid, and then living cells were counted. The results indicate that both the concentration of gambogic acid used to treat the cells as well as the length of treatment affected the growth inhibiting factor. For the same length of exposure, the higher the concentration of gambogic acid that was administered, the greater the effect on inhibiting cell growth. When comparing cultures at the same dose, the longer the cells were exposed to gambogic acid, the higher the growth inhibition. Results indicate that cell growth is dependent on both the magnitude of the dose administered as well as the length of time exposed to gambogic acid. Effects on telomerase activity Enhanced telomerase activity can be an indicator of abnormal cells. Most normal tissues have inactivated or repressed telomerase activity, but it becomes activated in germ cells and most malignant tumors. Treatment of SPC-A1 cells with gambogic acid resulted in a significant decline in telomerase activity when treated for 48 or 72 hours (detecting 80.7% and 84.9% reduction in activity, respectively). When treated with gambogic acid for only 24 hours, the decrease was only 25.9% which led researchers to believe there are at least two mechanisms responsible for slowing cell growth. Toxicity A high dose of gambogic acid showed slight side effects on the mouse central nervous system. In mice gambogic acid causes developmental toxicity in a dose-dependent manner, including low birth weight and inhibitory effects on fetal skeletal development. Analyzing mice that received the 4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg doses, there was no substantial weight loss, no gastrointestinal reactions to medication, no obvious changes in any vital organs, and no fatalities. Previous toxicity experiments at the 30 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg level also concluded that there were no significant changes to vital organs (such as the liver, heart, spleen, kidneys, lungs, testicles, and uterus) as well as no changes in body weight or white blood cells in peripheral blood. At the highest level of 120 mg/kg the primary toxic target organs were the liver and kidneys. At high doses in rats, the primary target of toxicity was found to be the kidney and liver.
