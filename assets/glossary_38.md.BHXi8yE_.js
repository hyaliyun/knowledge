The class were called the \\"Treasury class\\" because they were each named for former Secretaries of the Treasury. These ships were also collectively known as the \\"327's\\" as they were all in length.Silverstone 1968 p.373 The Treasury-class cutters proved highly adaptable, dependable, versatile and long-lived warships. Most served the United States for over 40 years, including with distinction and heroism through World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. In the words of naval historian John M. Waters, Jr., they were truly their nation's \\"maritime workhorses. The 327s battled through the 'Bloody Winter' of 1942‚Äì43 in the North Atlantic,\\" with the ships heroically fighting off and destroying German U-boats, and rescuing survivors from torpedoed convoy ships. Roles of the 327s included serving as amphibious task force flagships in World War II, pilot search and rescue (SAR) during the Korean War, and a critical component of Operation Market Time during the Vietnam War. \\"Most recently, these ships- that-wouldn't-die have done duty in fisheries patrol and drug interdiction. Built for only $2.5 million each, in terms of cost effectiveness we may never see the likes of these cutters again.\\"Waters 1967 Commencing in the late 1970s the Treasury-class cutters were gradually replaced or their duties taken over by larger modern high endurance cutters. Design and construction The 327s were designed to meet changing missions of the service as it emerged from the Prohibition era. Because the air passenger trade was expanding both at home and overseas, the Coast Guard believed that cutter-based aircraft would be essential for future high-seas search and rescue. Also, during the mid-1930s, narcotics smuggling, mostly opium, was on the increase, and long-legged, fairly fast cutters were needed to curtail it. The Treasury class were an attempt to develop a cutter capable of carrying an airplane in a hangar. The final design was based on the Erie-class US Navy gunboats; the machinery plant and hull below the waterline were identical. This standardization would save money‚Äîalways paramount in the Coast Guard's mind, as the cutters were built in U.S. Navy shipbuilding yards. Thirty-two preliminary designs based upon the Erie class were drawn up before one was finally selected. The healthy sheer forward and the high slope in the deck in the wardrooms was known as the \\"Hunnewell Hump.\\" Commander (Constructor) F. G. Hunnewell, USCG, was the head of the Construction and Repair Department at that time.

They had crews of between 120 and 230 depending on whether they were serving in peace or wartime. The ships were originally built with two open centerline 5\\"/51 caliber gun mounts forward, and carried either a single Grumman JF-2 Duck or Curtiss SOC-4 aft. Various arrangements of 3\\"/50 and 5\\"/51 guns and depth charge throwers were installed aft when the planes were removed in 1940‚Äì41.Silverstone 1968 p.369 Postwar armament typically included hedgehog and an enclosed 5\\"/38 caliber gun mount forward and Mark 32 anti-submarine warfare torpedo tubes aft.Albrecht 1969 p.178 World War II service The 327s were also known for their high \\"Kill Rate\\" during World War II.

It forms a loop in the southwest part of the U.S. state of Colorado traversing the heart of the San Juan Mountains. It roughly parallels the routes of the narrow gauge railways: Rio Grande Southern (US 160, SH 145 and SH 62); and the unconnected Ouray and Silverton Branches of the Denver & Rio Grande along US 550 with the Silverton Railroad bridging a part of the gap. Its origin can be traced to the Around the Circle Route promoted by the D&RG.;  Route description  = U.S. Highway 160 = View of San Juan Mountains from the San Juan Skyway Starting in Durango, Colorado, the largest city on San Juan Skyway, the byway follows U.S. Highway 160 (US 160) west through the town of Mancos to Cortez passing the entrance to Mesa Verde National Park. = State Highway 145 = Lizard Head Peak The byway turns north at Cortez, following State Highway 145 (SH 145) through the town of Dolores and the Dolores River into the San Juan National Forest. The byway passes through Rico, county seat of Dolores County prior to 1941. The old Courthouse still remains. From Rico the byway crosses 10,222 ft (3116 m) Lizard Head Pass and enters the Uncompahgre National Forest. Lizard Head Pass provides views of the El Diente Peak, the Mount Wilson, the Wilson Peak and the pass's namesake, the Lizard Head Peak. The byway descends near the town of Ophir past the location of the Ophir Loop of the Rio Grande Southern Railroad. A spur road heads off to the mining town turned ski resort of Telluride. The byway follows the San Miguel River to the town of Placerville. = State Highway 62 = The byway turns east at Placerville onto SH 62 and follows it over Dallas Divide. There are many excellent views of the San Juan Mountains, especially of the mountains around the Mount Sneffels. From top of the divide the byway descends into the town of Ridgway. The entire route of the byway from Durango to Ridgway roughly follows the route of the Rio Grande Southern Railroad. = U.S. Highway 550 = The characteristic red mountains of Red Mountain Pass Mountains above Ouray From Ridgway, the byway turns south onto US 550 following the Uncompahgre River into the Victorian mining town of Ouray. The highway is referred to as the Million Dollar Highway from Ouray south back to Durango. For the first south of Ouray the byway follows through the Uncompahgre Gorge. Just past the only tunnel on the route, just south of Ouray, the road crosses over Bear Creek Falls on a bridge at the location of an impassable toll booth on the original road. The Alpine Loop National Back Country Byway, a four wheel drive jeep road, takes off in the gorge south of Bear Creek Falls. Before leaving the gorge the byway passes through a snow shed under the Riverside Slide avalanche zone. A monument stands near here honoring those who have lost their lives in the avalanche, including several snowplow operators. At this point the byway enters Ironton Park, a nice flat valley in contrast to the gorge. The road ascends several switchbacks, or S-curves, past the Idarado mining operation to the summit of Red Mountain Pass, providing views of Red Mountain and several ghost towns. Back into the San Juan National Forest the highway descends through the Chattanooga Valley to Silverton. From Silverton the byway passes over the Molas Pass and the Coal Bank Pass, descending past the ski resort of Purgatory Resort. From Hermosa, the road parallels the Durango and Silverton narrow gauge railroad before returning to Durango.  History  The San Juan Skyway was designated as a National Forest Scenic Byway in September 1988. It was later named a Colorado Scenic and Historic Byway in 1989 and an All-American Road in September 1996.

The paper was owned and operated by Denmark, Wisconsin-based Brown County Publishing Company during much of its existence, and competed with the larger and more established Green Bay Press-Gazette. The Gannett newspaper chain, the Press-Gazette's parent company, owned the News-Chronicle during its last year of existence. History =Early years= The News-Chronicle launched on November 13, 1972 as The Green Bay Daily News. The International Typographical Union had gone on strike against the Press-Gazette, unhappy with the hot-lead- to-computer typeset changeover and other new technologies that the Press- Gazette and other newspapers were acquiring at that time, which the union feared would cost its membership their jobs. The Daily News was formed to bring in money for the strikers and to support their cause. From 1972 to 1976, the Daily News lost money in its head-to-head competition with the Press- Gazette. During the Daily News' first year, both newspapers were distributed in the afternoon. Shortly after beginning its second year of publication, the Daily News switched to a morning edition, allowing it to print the latest news and sports, including late games, several hours before the afternoon Press- Gazette. The smaller Daily News, with a circulation of roughly 12,000, competed against the larger Press-Gazette on several fronts, including breaking news on a John Doe investigation, breaking news on the National Football League Players Association strike against the NFL, and improved coverage of stock car racing, high school and college sports, and the Green Bay Bobcats hockey team. Wealthy local businessman Victor McCormick, who had a personal dislike for the Press-Gazette, became a major investor in the Daily News and remained an active voice in its operations until a 1976 heart attack forced him to end his financial support. =Frank Wood Takes Over= With the Daily News on the verge of bankruptcy and owing one of their creditors enough money to have them pull the plug, that creditor‚ÄîBrown County Publishing Co., publisher of several weekly publications in Northeast Wisconsin and the Daily News' printer‚Äîagreed to buy the Daily News. The company's owner, Frank A. Wood, made the purchase believing that the Green Bay community could benefit from two daily newspapers. Wood's first major change to the paper had already taken place three years earlier, when the Daily News moved from afternoon to morning publication. After the purchase, the paper was rechristened the Green Bay News-Chronicle (the hyphenated name referring to Wood's weekly paper, the Brown County Chronicle). Wood also revamped the paper from broadsheet to a tabloid format, which made it easier to read at the breakfast table. After purchasing the paper, he also started to grow a beard and vowed not to shave until the paper had a break-even month. It took 21 months and a 13-inch beard before the News-Chronicle turned a $125.81 profit in November 1977. Wood brought editorial cartoonist Lyle Lahey over from the weekly Chronicle to the daily News-Chronicle. Lahey and his cartoons were a prominent feature of the News-Chronicle's Opinion section until the paper's closing. The Opinion section also featured a lively array of local columnists with varying viewpoints: Curt Andersen, Ray Barrington, Warren Bluhm, Michelle Kennedy, Bill LuMaye, Yvonne Metivier and Sid Vineburg. The News-Chronicle gained a niche audience with its local sports coverage, including reporting on the sport of bowling. Wood decided to market subscriptions to the local bowling community, promising that their sport would receive better and more prominent coverage in the News-Chronicle. The move paid off with a substantial increase in subscriptions from area bowlers, as well as the paper earning several awards from bowling organizations for its in-depth coverage of the sport. =The battle with Gannett= By the mid-1980s, the paper had just started to make an occasional profit when Gannett, which had bought the Press-Gazette in 1980, started to make life difficult for the News-Chronicle, which at the time had a circulation of 15,000 compared to the Press-Gazette's 100,000. By virtue of its worldwide presence, Gannett could afford to sell its advertising at a much lower price, thus to stifling or killing competing papers such as the News-Chronicle. Wood had long disdained Gannett and its operation of the Press-Gazette, but felt that the conglomerate's tactics went too far. He responded by calling on long-time friend and Santa Fe Reporter editor/publisher Richard McCord to document for the News-Chronicle the tactics Gannett used to rid its competition in other two-newspaper towns. In November and December 1989, those findings were printed in an award-winning two-week series, \\"It's Now Or Never\\", which chronicled the alleged abuses by Gannett and moves that the News-Chronicle had made to counter the Press-Gazette's tactics. McCord later wrote a book about Gannett's abuses and the News- Chronicle series, entitled The Chain Gang: One Newspaper Versus the Gannett Empire. \\"It's Now Or Never\\" served as a battle cry for the News-Chronicle in its efforts to survive and remain a second voice in the Green Bay newspaper market. As a \\"call to arms\\" to local readers, however, the series proved to be too successful. The increased attention the series provided, along with subscription incentives, resulted in a deluge of subscription orders. The increase overwhelmed the paper's circulation staff, and as a result many subscribers became unhappy with the poor customer service, and dropped their subscriptions. =Advancements in the 1990s= Following an upgrade at the paper's Denmark printing facilities in the mid-1990s, the News-Chronicle added full-color photography and graphics to the paper. A major redesign in 1997 gave the paper a full-color front and back page. The paper's sections also underwent redesign, including the Friday entertainment section, \\"Rave!\\" The News-Chronicle launched a Web site in September 1996, greenbaynewschron.com, getting on the Internet ahead of its competition. The entry was timely, as the Green Bay Packers' run to Super Bowls XXXI and XXXII gave the paper and its sports coverage worldwide attention. By 1998, the Press-Gazette changed from an afternoon to a morning newspaper, first changing subscriptions in outlying rural areas to morning distribution and then gradually doing the same for Green Bay metropolitan area subscribers. This caused both newspapers to once again go head-to-head for subscribers and readership. In 1999, the News- Chronicle began a Sunday edition which was distributed as part of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, requiring subscribers to take the Milwaukee paper if they wanted the News-Chronicle's Sunday edition. The move was seen as increasing the visibility of the Green Bay paper. After a few months, the News-Chronicle also sold its Sunday edition separately, and the joint venture started to dissolve when the Journal Sentinel changed distribution in the Green Bay area from its regular Sunday edition to an \\"early bird\\" version focused on early coupon and circular access without current news or sports coverage. At the same time, the News-Chronicle also added a Sunday supplement, This Week, with writing from other newspapers owned by Brown County Publishing. =The end of the line= Wood's printing operation and other successful weeklies provided the profits to cover the News-Chronicle's losses. But by 2004, the then 76-year-old Wood finally ran out of steam. A downturn in the commercial printing market, as well as no set plans for succession within the company, forced Wood to sell his operations‚Äîand to the most unlikely of buyers. On July 23, 2004, Wood announced he would sell the News-Chronicle and his other weeklies to Gannett for an undisclosed price. Wood kept ownership of his printing business, as well as an automobile sales publication. Many of the News-Chronicle's employees and readers were stunned at the announcement, but Gannett had said they would maintain the status quo for the short term. Although the News-Chronicle continued to publish as a separate paper, and received printing and technological upgrades as it was switched to Gannett facilities and presses, its circulation and advertising functions were gradually merged with that of the Press-Gazette. The News-Chronicle's ownership by Gannett could not reverse the paper's failing health, as advertisers spent their advertising money with the larger Gannett newspaper, along with Gannett's acquisition of other publications down the lakeshore and around the Fox River Valley and Lake Winnebago, effectively consolidating a wide-ranging market with seven publications into one monopoly of those seven newspapers controlled by Gannett. On May 26, 2005, Gannett announced that the paper would cease operations with the June 3, 2005 edition. The News-Chronicle had been the longest-running \\"strike paper\\" in newspaper publishing history. Most of its remaining employees were offered jobs at other Gannett publications in the area.

They have a dark brown body in autumn, lighter in summer, usually bronze-colored. They show red-orange to cream markings at the tip of their scutella. The connexium usually has dark brown, reddish, and light blue bands. The legs and the first segment of the antennae are usually red-brown or bright orange. Its distinguishing characteristic is a pair of projections extending forward from the shoulders at the front of its dorsal thorax.British BugsNature Spot The larvae are dark, but become lighter, especially at the hind body, with increasing age. Biology Forest bugs are polyphagous. Their main food source is any of several species of oaks, but they can also be found on alder, hazel, and other deciduous trees, including apple and cherry. They are sap-feeders and use piercing mouthparts to withdraw the liquid. Occasionally, adults consume insects, especially caterpillars, as well as fruits. Adults can be found from July to November. Females lay eggs during the summer in the cracks of tree bark, or on a leaf top, and the larvae hatch the following spring. Forest bugs are also an agricultural and garden pest, as it feeds on fruit and nut trees.

The Circle was originally created by Gary Gygax around 1975 as an alliance of most of his own personal Dungeons & Dragons characters. In 1988, the concept of the Circle was redeveloped by TSR as part of a new storyline for the World of Greyhawk campaign. This new Circle of Eight became a powerful cabal of wizards based in the Flanaess, the easternmost portion of Oerik. Its chief purpose seemed to be the preservation of the balance of power between the forces of Good, Evil, Law, and Chaos in the Flanaess. Despite the organization's name, this new Circle of Eight actually has nine members, being composed of eight powerful wizards and their leader, Mordenkainen the archmage. For this reason, some sources call the group \\"Mordenkainen and the Circle of Eight.\\" Development Gary Gygax, while helping to create the game of Dungeons & Dragons, developed a home campaign in and around the City of Greyhawk to playtest the new game. Not only was Gygax the \\"dungeon master\\" most of the time, but he also had an opportunity to be a player when his friend Rob Kuntz was the dungeon master. As a player, Gygax created many different characters for the Greyhawk world. At the point when eight of these characters ‚Äî Mordenkainen (wizard), Yrag (fighter), Bigby (wizard), Rigby (cleric), Zigby (dwarf), Felnorith (elf), Vram (elf) & Vin (elf)Gygax: \\"The Obsidian Citadel and its Circle of Eight was original to my own campaign. When Mordenkainen was at a level I considered too high for normal adventuring, I used the money he and his associates had amassed to construct the said fortress. The members of the 'Circle were Mordenkainen and...others of my PCs: Bigby, Yrag the fighter, Rigby the cleric, Zigby the Dwarf, the Elves Vram and Vin, and Felnorith as principles. A number of lesser PCs were [also] associated.\\" ‚Äî had collectively accumulated both enough wealth that they couldn't easily spend it, as well as standing armies that rivalled most nations' forces, Gygax had the eight characters form an alliance that he called the Circle of Eight. Gygax had the Eight construct a stronghold in the middle of an evil land so they would not have to travel far to find adventure.Gygax: \\"The original [Circle of Eight] was composed of my PCs--Mordenkainen, Bigby, Yrag, Rigby, Felnorith, Zigby, Vram & Vin. In the novel version the Circle was expanded to encompass other PCs in my campaign such as Tenser. It came into being because Mordenkainen and Associates had a lot of wealth stored up from successful adventuring, located a place for a stronghold deep in enemy territory to assure plenty of action, and then went to work building the citadel. As there was a small army of dwarves associated with the larger, mounted field army, the building project went relatively quickly, about three game years to complete. While it was in progress, the 'boys' were active in raiding the lands around to keep the enemy forces back on their heels.\\" After three years of game time, the resulting structure was the Obsidian Citadel, a massive and impregnable octagonal castleGygax: \\"The Obsidian Citadel was indeed my personal creation as a player.... It was an octagonal castle with eight wall towers and a central keep with much space between the outer wall and the inner works because of the number of troops housed in this fortress. from which Gygax could direct any of the Eight to sally forth in search of adventure. After Gygax was ousted from TSR in 1985, the company took over creative control of the published Greyhawk setting, including the names of any characters who had ever been named in TSR publications. In 1988, The City of Greyhawk boxed set by Carl Sargent and Rik Rose remolded Gygax's old \\"Circle of Eight\\" into a new plot device. Instead of a group of eight companions belonging to Gygax who sallied forth from an impregnable bastion to fight evil, the Circle became eight wizards brought together by Gygax's own creation now owned by TSR, Mordenkainen. For the other wizards, Sargent and Rose used the names of Greyhawk wizards, some of them created by other players, that Gygax had borrowed in order to name spells in the original Players Handbook. A good example of this was Rary, a low-level wizard originally created by Brian Blume for Gygax's home campaign. Blume had played Rary only until he reached 3rd-level, at which point Blume retired him, having reached his objective, which was to be able to introduce his character as \\"Medium Rary\\".Gygax: \\"[Rary] was one that Brian Blume created early in the D&D; cycle, a magic-user that Brian wanted to work up to 3rd level so as to introduce him as 'Medium Rary.' When he gained that level Brian quit playing that PC, pretty much dropped out of regularly playing D&D; in fact.\\" Gygax had borrowed the name \\"Rary\\" for two high-level spells in the Player's Handbook, Rary's mnemonic enhancer and Rary's telepathic bond, although Blume's Rary was not powerful enough to cast either of them. Now that TSR owned the rights to the name \\"Rary\\", Sargent and Rose transformed Rary into a powerful wizard and a member of this new Circle of Eight. In addition to Mordenkainen and Rary, there were six other wizards associated with spells in the Player's Handbook that Sargent and Rose made members of their new Circle: Bigby, Otiluke, Drawmij, Tenser, Nystul, Otto. However, Sargent and Rose needed a total of nine wizards in order to have Mordenkainen and the Circle of Eight, so they created a new wizard, Jallarzi Sallavarian. The mandate of this new Circle was to act as neutral referees between Good and Evil, never letting one side or the other gain the upper hand for long. In addition, Sargent & Rose took Gygax's original Obsidian Citadel, repurposed it as Mordenkainen's castle, and placed it in an unspecified location in the Yatil Mountains. Game designer Ken Rolston described this new Circle of Eight as \\"a powerful and influential local organization of wizards\\". In 1990, ten years after Gygax had published the original Greyhawk setting, TSR decided that the decade-old world of Greyhawk needed to be refreshed, and moved the campaign timeline forward a decade, from 576 CY to 586 CY, in order to provide a new storyline as outlined in the new setting, Greyhawk Wars. This was a new and bleaker Greyhawk, shattered by a long war and an act of treachery that involved the Circle of Eight. Greyhawk Wars Adventurer's Book, included with the boxed set, described this war in detail: In 582 CY (six years after Gygax's original setting of 576 CY), a regional conflict started by Iuz gradually widened until it was a continent-wide war that affected almost every nation in the Flanaess. A peace treaty was finally signed in the city of Greyhawk two years later, which is why the conflict became known as the Greyhawk Wars. On the day of the treaty- signing, Rary attacked his fellow Circle members, aided and abetted by Robilar (a fighter originally created by Ron Kuntz; however, Gygax had mentioned Robilar in several columns in TSR publications, meaning that TSR now owned the rights to the name). This treacherous attack killed Tenser and Otiluke, while Robilar and Rary fled to the deserts of the Bright Lands. With the loss of Tenser, Otiluke and Rary, the Circle of Eight now only had five members. In a later development of the storyline in 1998 by Roger E. Moore, the adventure Return of the Eight published by Wizards of the Coast, the players meet the surviving members of the Circle of Eight (now called the \\"Circle of Five\\" because it was missing Tenser, Otiluke and Rary). If the players successfully finish the adventure, Tenser is rescued from death (although he refuses to rejoin the Circle), and the players convince three new wizards to fill the three empty spots in the Circle: Warnes Starcoat, Alhamazad the Wise, and Theodain Eriason.Moore, Roger E. Return of the Eight (TSR, 1998) Fictional history Using various TSR and Wizards of the Coast publications, a historical timeline of the post-Gygax Circle of Eight can be drawn: =The Citadel of Eight= The Citadel of Eight was formed at some point after 561 CY, and was dissolved in 569 CY. Its initial membership was Mordenkainen (its founder) and Bigby, his apprentice. The two decided to form a group to attempt to maintain the balance between the extremes of Oerth. They recruited Robilar, Riggby, Yrag, Tenser, Serten, and Otis. The name of the group was based on their number and Mordenkainen's Obsidian Citadel. The group eventually dissolved for ideological reasons (in the case of Robilar and Otis), because of grudges between members (such as Tenser who blamed Mordenkainen for the death of Serten), or because of outright death in the case of Serten who fell in 569 CY fighting against the hordes of evil. =The Circle of Eight= The Circle was founded in 571 CY by Mordenkainen, from the remnants of the Citadel. Among the group's original members were former Citadel member Bigby, as well as the wizards Bucknard, Drawmij, Leomund, Nystul, Otto, and Rary. In 574 CY, Leomund left to explore other planes of existence, and was replaced by former Citadel member Tenser. In 576 CY, Otiluke, president of Greyhawk's Society of Magi and member of the city's Directing Oligarchy, joined the Circle. In 579 CY, Bucknard mysteriously disappeared, and was not replaced until 581 CY, when Jallarzi Sallivarian became the first woman to join the Circle of Eight. Later in 581 CY, nearly six months after Jallarzi joined, the group met with tragedy when all its members, save Mordenkainen, were slain by Halmadar the Cruel, a former Shield Lands tyrant under the control of the fabled lich Vecna, who had somehow achieved godhood. Mordenkainen responded by assembling a group of adventurers to thwart Vecna's plans, and was able to recover the remains of his allies and clone them. The cloning took some time, which could otherwise have been used to prevent the Greyhawk Wars. By 584 CY, the Circle was fully restored and working toward an end to the Greyhawk Wars. On the eve of the day when all parties involved were to sign the treaty bringing the wars to an end, Otiluke, Tenser, and Bigby discovered a plan by the Circle's own Rary to slay all the assembled diplomats via a great magical trap. Unfortunately, Rary witnessed their discovery, and a great magical battle ensued, killing Otiluke and Tenser, and severely wounding Bigby, who was unable to pursue Rary as he escaped. Word later came that Rary's allies, among them former Citadel member Lord Robilar, had ensured Tenser's and Otiluke's deaths by destroying every clone they had prepared for such an incident. Rary and Robilar fled to the Bright Desert, southeast of Greyhawk, where they established the Empire of the Bright Lands. By 586 CY, the Circle had returned to its full membership of eight plus one. Though Tenser had been returned to life, via a clone he had hidden on one of Oerth's two moons, he had no desire to rejoin the Circle. Eventually Warnes Starcoat, Alhamazad the Wise, and the high elf Theodain Eriason, the Circle's first non-human member, replaced the three missing members.

It is divided into three subspecies--the eastern American toad (A. a. americanus), the dwarf American toad (A. a. charlesmithi), and the rare Hudson Bay toad (A. a. copei). Recent taxonomic treatments place this species in the genus Anaxyrus instead of Bufo.Review: The Amphibian Tree of Life, by Frost, D.R. et al., Amphibiatree Tadpoles The eggs of the American toad are laid in two strings and can hatch in 2‚Äì14 days. When hatched the tadpoles are recognizable by their skinny tails in relation to the size of their black bodies. They may advance to adulthood in 50‚Äì65 days. When metamorphosis is completed, the \\"toadlets\\" may stay in the water for a short period of time before they become mostly land based. Often entire groups of tadpoles reach the toadlet stage at once and a mass migration to higher ground takes place usually to shaded areas of mid range and upland forests bordering the marshes from where they bred. Toadlets can be observed eating microscopic bugs as fast as they can in the ground area they roam between various vegetation; they are also known to eat ants, spiders, slugs and worms. Studies have shown that they have a mutualistic relationship with Chlorogonium algae, which makes tadpoles develop faster than normal. Tadpoles have several mechanisms to reduce predation. They avoid predators by swimming in very shallow water often with thick grass vegetation, and by swimming close together in schools during the day. Tadpoles also produce toxic chemicals in their skin that discourage some potential predators. Fish have been reported to die after consuming one tadpole; however, most fish quickly learn to avoid eating American toad tadpoles. The tadpoles are also very small and they are a solid black color. Biogeography Based on DNA sequence comparisons, Anaxyrus americanus and other North American species of Anaxyrus are thought to be descended from an invasion of toads from South America prior to the formation of the Isthmus of Panama land bridge, presumably by means of rafting. Subspecies Races tend to hybridize with Anaxyrus woodhousii in their overlapping ranges. =Eastern American toad= Eastern American Toad in Ohio Eastern American Toad showing ground leaf camouflage in Darien Lakes State Park Eastern American Toad showing bare ground camouflage in Darien Lakes State Park Detail of parotoid glands The eastern American toad (A. a. americanus) is a medium-sized toad usually ranging in size from ;American toad (Bufo americanus) , Natural Resources Canada record . The color and pattern is somewhat variable, especially for the females. Skin color can change depending on habitat colors, humidity, stress, and temperature. Color changes range from yellow to brown to black, from solid colors to speckled. Their breeding habits are very similar to Anaxyrus fowleri. The call or voice of a breeding male is a high trill, lasting 6‚Äì30 seconds, similar to a ringing telephone. They hibernate during the winter. The eastern American toad has spots that contain only one to two warts. It also has enlarged warts on the tibia or lower leg below the knee. While the belly is usually spotted, in some areas many are, and it is generally more so on the forward half (in some rare individuals there may be few or no spots). This subspecies of the American toad has no or very little markings on it. The spades on the back legs are blackish. Some toads of this subspecies have a more pervasive red and deep brown color, many with red warts on their bodies. Also eastern American toads have parotoid glands that are the same color as the surrounding skin. The glands don't usually have any patterning on them. Other species that may be confused with the eastern American toad are Fowler's toad, which has three or more warts in the largest dark spots, and in the far west of its range woodhouse's toad. Fowler's toad can be especially difficult to identify in comparison to the eastern American toad but one difference is that it never has a spotted belly and both cranial crests touch the parotoid glands. Also, Fowler's toads are very fast hoppers (bursts of 5‚Äì10 fast hops) in comparison to Eastern toads lethargic, casual hopping and walking locomotion. In the eastern American toad these crests almost never touch the parotoid glands, which secrete bufotoxin, a poisonous substance meant to make the toad unpalatable to potential predators. Bufotoxin is a mild poison in comparison to that of other poisonous toads and frogs, but it can irritate human eyes and mucous membranes and is dangerous to smaller animals (such as dogs) when ingested. American toads require a semi-permanent freshwater pond or pool with shallow water in which to breed, to gather their water supplies in times of drought or as a routine, and for their early development. They also require dense patches of vegetation, for cover and hunting grounds. Given these two things and a supply of insects for food, American toads can live almost everywhere, ranging from forests to flat grassland. Females when caught are silent and easily tamed, adapting to terrarium life readily, while the smaller males are readily communicative. The smaller males do not adapt well to terrarium life and should be released after a few days of observation. Adult toads are mostly nocturnal, although juveniles are often abroad by day. When it rains, these toads will become active and can be observed eating robustly worms and insects leaving their burrows and walking in front of an opportunist toad. These toads are 'creatures of habit' once they have a certain area they prefer to live within... an acre of wooded forest with water in proximity for soaking, a home with cool ledges and window wells; they commonly seek cover in burrows, under boardwalks, flat stones, boards, logs, wood piles, or other cover. When cold weather comes, these toads dig backwards and bury themselves in the dirt of their summer homes, or they may choose another site in which to hibernate. Their diet includes crickets, mealworms, earthworms, ants, spiders, slugs, centipedes, moths, and other small invertebrates. Some of these toads have been known to live over 30 years and currently a female specimen (over 13 centimeters long) is living healthily into her late 30s. Another female toad of 17 centimeters is known to have existed in Wisconsin from Washington Island on Lake Michigan. The eastern American toad may be confused with the Canadian toad in the area where they overlap, but the cranial crests in the American toad do not join to form a raised \\"boss\\" (bump) like they do in the Canadian toad. Its range also overlaps with the southern toad's, but in this species the cranial crests form two unique knobs. =Dwarf American toad= The dwarf American toad (A. a. charlesmithi), is a smaller version of the American toad, which reaches lengths of about , is generally a dark reddish color ranging to light red in some specimens in isolated populations. The spots on the back are reduced or absent, and when present they contain a few small red warts and a black ring around it like in the normal American toad. The warts are always darker than the skin of the toad. Some specimens have a white dorsal line in the middle of their backs. The ventral surface or belly is usually cream colored with a few dark spots in the breast area. This subspecies can be distinguished from the above-mentioned species in the same manner as for the eastern American toad. The southwestern portion of the Dwarf American toad's range overlaps with that of the Gulf Coast toad. The latter species is distinguished by the presence of a dark lateral stripe as well as a deep \\"valley\\" between its prominent cranial crests. It eats mainly spiders, worms and small insects. =Hudson Bay toad= The Hudson Bay toad (A. a. copei) is a rare Canadian subspecies of A. americanus. This subspecies of the American toad has been seen in the northern parts of Ontario where there are a few isolated populations. These northern dwarf toads mostly have the red coloring on the sides of their bodies and have an unusually high number of warts for the subspecies. Interbreeding with eastern American toads caused this subspecies to lose the red coloring on their backs. Inbreeding avoidance Toads display breeding site fidelity, as do many other amphibians. Individuals that return to natal ponds to breed will likely encounter siblings as potential mates. Although incest is possible, Anaxyrus americanus siblings rarely mate. These toads likely recognize and actively avoid close kins as mates. Advertisement vocalizations by males appear to serve as cues by which females recognize their kin.

It is located in the traditional rural district of Valdres. The museum is on a small ridge reaching out into Strandefjorden, with the larger buildings closest to the entrance and with smaller farm houses up on the slightly higher area reaching out into the lake. There are 95 houses and other constructions, comprising around 20,000 items, and the museum is the fourth largest Norwegian outdoor museum. All the items in the museum are original and have been collected from various farms and other locations in the area. Valdres Folk Museum hosts various cultural events including folk music festivals, seminars and open air theatre. During 2010, a new reception building was opened and linked to the administration building. The museum runs several subsidiaries including Bagn Bygdesamling and Bautahaugen Samlinger, both located in S√∏r-Aurdal.Valdres folkemuseum (Nord AurdalKommune) Valdres Folkemuseum (Store norske leksikon) Notable buildings Brennbygningen (main house) comes from Brenna in the small village √Öbj√∏r in Nord-Aurdal. It was bought in 1945 and relocated the following year. It is assumed the building dates to around 1740. At the top floor there are beds built as closed constructions, so that their occupants would keep warm in the winter time. Handeloftet (main house) is the first building at Valdres Folkemuseum, bought from Hande farm in Vestre Slidre 27 December 1905 for the amount of 1000 kroner. Originally it was reerected at Valdres Bygdesamling in 1906, and relocated to its current location in 1923. It is assumed to have been built in the period 1530‚Äì1640. The outside gallery surrounds the building on three sides. This building is named loft indicating a storage house, yet it is assumed it has always been a main house. Hovistabburet (storage house) is from Hovi farm in √òystre Slidre, most likely built in the 13th century. The building was bought in 1944 and moved to its current location. At the top floor there is an unusual room named the virgin room. The door posts has ornaments from the medieval period. The building underwent restoration in 1960. Rognebygningen (main house) from Rogne farm in √òystre Slidre, was probably built 1670‚Äì1680. In previous times the farm has been an officer's farm (kapteinsgard), then a bailiff's farm (lensmannsgard) and later an inn (skysstasjon). Captain Johan Reinert resided at the farm between 1670 and 1680, later captain Jacob de Caucheron resided there between 1712 and 1720. Valdres Folkemuseum bought the house in 1917 and relocated it to its current location in 1923. It is known that Michael Sars and Aasmund Olavsson Vinje resided in the building when they traveled to Eidsbugarden.

Since the museums participate on a voluntary basis to the regular enrichment of the database, some can present a large part of their collection, while others appear only because of the mere permanent deposits made by the first ones. Live on the French Minitel system from 1992, the database went online to the World Wide Web in 1995. Originally just for objects from the fine arts and decorative arts, in 2004 Joconde was united with what had been separate databases for objects from archeology and ethnology. It comes under the \\"Direction des Mus√©es de France\\" (DMF) section of the Ministry. The listing details are highly structured, using a special vocabulary, which allows for very specific and accurate searches, helped as well by the index. A small number of the best known objects have a prose commentary. Not all images are in colour, especially for the archaeological collections. When an object created after the 19th century has no image this is most often for copyright reasons.

The wash is sometimes called an urban river, and it exists in its present capacity because of an urban population. The wash also works in a systemic conjunction with the pre-existing wetlands that formed the oasis of the Las Vegas Valley. The wash is fed by urban runoff, shallow ground water, reclaimed water, and stormwater. The wetlands of the Las Vegas Valley act as the kidneys of the environment, cleaning the water that runs through it. The wetlands filter out harmful residues from fertilizers, oils, and other contaminants that can be found on the roadways and in the surrounding desert. Near its terminus at Las Vegas Bay, the wash passes under the man made Lake Las Vegas through two 7-foot pipes.  History  The wash just below Lake Las Vegas Before development in the valley above the wash, it was able to contain the flows from rain water that fell in the valley and hills above. When the first sewage treatment plant went on line, the flows began increasing to the point that the channel expanded in size as the increased flows eroded the wash's stream-banks. This erosion also deepened the channel draining one of the largest desert wetlands in the U.S. southwest as the water flowed down the channel rather than flooding the wetlands area. This has had several consequences among them, increased flows of silt into Lake Mead, fewer migratory birds, reduced water polishing from the native plants, and infestation of invasive plant species such as African Tamarisk (Tamarix africana) and Sahara Mustard (Brassica tournefortii).

Gopalan hailed from the village of Morappakam in Chingleput district, some 50 kilometres from Chennai. His family moved to Triplicane in Chennai when he was young. Gopalan was discovered by C. P. Johnstone, one of the founding fathers of Madras cricket. As was his practice with promising players, Johnstone gave him a job in the Burmah Shell. Gopalan soon switched his allegiance to the Triplicane Cricket Club. He owed his fame in local circles mainly to his performances here. He was a fast medium bowler who moved the ball both ways. When he was selected to make his first class debut in the Madras Presidency tournament, it was not a popular decision. The crowd barracked him when he did not take a wicket till lunch on the first day, but he went on to take five wickets in each innings. He also impressed against Arthur Gilligan's MCC team which was touring India at the time. Another performance of some significance were the two matches in 1930 for Madras against the Vizianagram XI which included Jack Hobbs. In the first, Gopalan dismissed Hobbs in both innings; in the second he clean bowled the great man with a leg-cutter that pitched on the leg stump and took the off bail. Against Ceylon in 1933, he took a famous hattrick, the first in Chepauk. This came in his eighth over when he took wickets with his first, third, fourth and fifth balls, hitting the middle stump each time. When Ranji Trophy was inaugurated in 1934, Madras and Mysore (now Tamil Nadu and Karnataka) played the first match. To Gopalan went the honour of delivering the first ball of the tournament. His only Test match was against England at Calcutta in early 1934. Gopalan's hockey career was helped by Robert Summerhayes who was to hockey in Madras what Johnstone was to cricket. In 1935, he toured New Zealand with the Indian hockey team which enjoyed enormous success. The next year he was selected for the cricket team to tour England. It was known beforehand that Gopalan would have a small role to play in the England tour because of the presence of Mohammad Nissar and Amar Singh. He might have been picked in the hockey team for the Berlin Olympics but chose to skip the Olympic trials. This turned out to be a terrible decision. The hockey team captained by Dhyan Chand, one of the finest teams in the history of the sport, won the gold medal with little difficulty. As it turned out, Gopalan did not play a Test in England. The tour was marred by internal politics and the team returned in disgrace. Gopalan's batting improved with time. Johnstone wrote later that it featured a \\"stance at the wicket with his left toe cocked up in the air. Since it was the stance adopted by England's most famous cricketer, W.G. Grace, he could hardly be faulted on this account. He was then about a No.10 batsman, but by steady application he showed what improvement a bowler who really tries can make in batting and later on played many fine innings\\".\\"Johnstone looks back\\", Indian Express, March 21, 1965S Muthiah, The Spirit of Chepauk, East West Books (1998), The most celebrated of these 'many fine innings' was a 64 against the West Indians in 1949 which featured some thrilling driving. In 1952, a silver jubilee fund was started to celebrate Gopalan's 25 years in cricket and hockey. An annual cricket match was instituted between Madras and Ceylon (later Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka) for the M. J. Gopalan Trophy. This yearly tournament continued with a few interruptions till Sri Lanka got Test status in the early 1980s. It was revived in 2000 as a match between Tamil Nadu and a Colombo District Cricket Association. This also lapsed after two years. He served as a national selector for a few years in the 1950s. Gopalan was the oldest living Test cricketer at the time of his death. According to him, he was born in 1906 but the year of his birth was recorded wrongly in the school records. One of the entrances to the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium is named after Gopalan.

He was the first native of his state to become its governor. He was a Republican from the progressive wing of that party, which was identified nationally with Theodore Roosevelt of New York. Early life Born in Nehawka in Cass County in southeastern Nebraska, Sheldon received a bachelor's degree in 1892 from the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln. As a cadet at Nebraska he commanded Company A of the University's Military Department headed by Lieutenant John J. Pershing. He led Company A to win the Maiden Prize of $1,500 at the National Competitive Drills in Omaha on June 13, 1892. Sheldon was also a founding member of the Varsity Rifles, which became Pershing Rifles. He then attended Harvard University for one year, receiving a second bachelor's degree cum laude in 1893. He married Rose Higgins in 1895, and they had four children. Career During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Sheldon served as a captain in the 3rd Nebraska Volunteer Infantry, commanded by Colonel William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska, who had just lost to William McKinley of Ohio in the race for president two years before. En route to Cuba, the regiment traveled through Mississippi, and Sheldon liked what he saw there. After the war, Sheldon returned to Nebraska. In 1902, he purchased a plantation of 1,700 acres near Greenville, Mississippi. That same year, at the age of 32, he successfully ran for state senate in Nebraska, and was re-elected in 1904. The railroads had been central to the creation of Nebraska territory through the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, but public perception among white Nebraskans had changed. When the Union Pacific and Burlington railroads were \\"opening up\\" the land to settlement (and the dispossession of the Native American inhabitants), towns were eager to court the railroads. However, anger at apparent railroad domination of Nebraska politics had been growing for decades. On June 16, 1906, Sheldon and fellow progressive Norris Brown, who was then attorney general, announced that they were seeking the Republican nominations for governor and U.S. Senator, respectively. Sheldon was on record as favoring regulation of the railroads, having said, \\"You can trust the representatives of the people to deal fairly with the railroads, but you cannot trust the railroads to deal fairly with the people.\\" Sheldon defeated the Democratic nominee, Ashton C. Shallenberger, who was viewed as \\"being under railroad influence,\\" 97,858 (53.5 percent) to 84,885 (46.5 percent). Sheldon became the first Nebraska governor born in the state and one of its youngest ever. With huge majorities in both chambers of the legislature (Nebraska's legislature would not become unicameral for another twenty years), Sheldon moved quickly to redeem his campaign promises. Accordingly, the 1907 legislative session has been characterized by historians James C. Olson and Ronald C. Naugle as creating \\"more important and more permanent changes in the political structure of the state than those of any other.\\" These included prohibitions on the free train passes that railroads had previously distributed generously to influence politicians, a restriction on train passenger fares to no more than two cents, and the establishment of a state railway commission. That year Sheldon also signed a child labor law, an anti-discrimination law, a law forbidding brewers from owning any part of a saloon, and legislation creating a state board of pardons and a bureau charged with investigating agricultural pests and plant diseases. The 1907 legislature also enacted a statewide direct primary law, but that would continue to be a hot political issue for many years and be frequently revised. Sheldon ran into two political hurdles to his re-election. First, bank deposits had seemed especially at risk during the financial panic of 1907, when many banks failed. However, although Sheldon personally favored a state law guaranteeing bank deposits similar to the one in Oklahoma territory, the Republican convention overwhelmingly voted it down. Second, he fought hard for an option for individual counties to prohibit liquor, losing many \\"wet\\" votes that he might otherwise have picked up. Ashton Shallenberger secured the Democratic nomination, and campaigned hard for a state bank guarantee law. He skillfully allowed \\"dries\\" think he was for prohibition and \\"wets\\" to think he was against it. Shallenberger decisively beat Sheldon, 132,960 to 125,976, and the Democrats gained majority control of both houses of the legislature. =Mississippi= After his defeat, Sheldon moved to his plantation in Mississippi, and became active in state politics there. He was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives. While Sheldon was publicly a staunch Republican, he was elected in the 1918 Democratic primary. He registered as a Republican while in the Mississippi House of Representatives. He retired after a single term due to financial conditions on his plantation. In 1927, he organized the moribund state Republican Party. After the election, Herbert Hoover appointed Sheldon the Mississippi state head of the Internal Revenue Service. He ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1947, having polled only 2.5 percent of the ballots cast. In 1956, Sheldon was the leader of the small Lily-White Movement in the Mississippi Republican Party, which had formerly carried the backing of former President Theodore Roosevelt. A new faction of conservative lawyers and businesspeople, many from the Young Republicans organization, led by Wirt Yerger from the capital city of Jackson gained control of the Mississippi party. By the margin of his own vote, Yerger was elected the first modern chairman of the Mississippi GOP.Billy Hathorn, \\"Challenging the Status Quo: Rubel Lex Phillips and the Mississippi Republican Party (1963‚Äì1967)\\", The Journal of Mississippi History XLVII, November 1985, No. 4, p. 241 Perry Wilbon Howard, the long-term African American leader of the Black and Tans contingent, continued to serve as National Committeeman until his death in 1961. After Sheldon, the next Republican to seek the governorship was Rubel Phillips of Corinth and Jackson, who ran in 1963 on a ticket with State Senator Stanford Morse of Gulfport. Phillips tried again in 1967 but was crushed by U.S. Representative John Bell Williams, by which time Clarke Reed had succeeded Wirt Yerger as the party chairman. In 1991, Kirk Fordice became the first Republican elected as governor of Mississippi since Reconstruction. Death Sheldon died in Greenville, Mississippi, on April 4, 1960. He is interred at Greenville Cemetery. References External links * George L. Sheldon papers at the Nebraska State Historical Society.

The population at the was 3,714. The name originates from an Aboriginal word also recorded as 'Buninyouang', said to mean 'man lying on his back with his knees raised', which is in reference to the shape of Mount Buninyong.UBD Victoria Country Road Atlas, 14th edition, Universal Publishers, 2004. European settlers named it Bunnenyong and the name later simplified to its current form. History Buninyong has an important place in history as one of the principal inland communities of pre-gold rush Victoria. It was explored in January 1838 by a party including Thomas and Somerville Learmonth, and then occupied by the Learmonths in February 1838 as a sheep station.Bride, Thomas F., Letters from Victorian pioneers to His Excellency Charles Joseph La Trobe, Govt. Printer, Melbourne, 1898, p41. A Post Office opened on 1 January 1845 to serve the needs of the settlers and was known as Bunnenyong until 1859. Although gold was being found in the area from about 1840 the 'official' finding of gold was when it was found 3 kilometres west of the town in 1851 by Thomas Hiscock, the local Buninyong blacksmith, at an area still known as Hiscock's.Griffiths Peter M, Three Times Blest A History of Buninyong 1837 - 1901, Ballarat Historical Society pp13 Evidence is slowly emerging that the early pastoralists were finding gold, but not making their good fortune known because of the fear the Colonial Government would confiscate their finds because the whole area was Crown Land. By 1871 there were 2281 people and 20 hotels at Buninyong. A significant figure in Buninyong's gold rush era was Henry Joseph Desoza.Henry Joseph Desoza from a paper presented to the Buninyong Historical Society by Robert W. Bell. Historian. Desoza was a wealthy philanthropist who made his fortune by both speculation and the leasing of both land and machinery to gold mining companies. One such enterprise was named the Desoza Freehold, from which Desoza received royalties. Desoza himself never held shares in The Desoza Freehold or any other mine he helped finance relying instead on the royalty system. In a peculiar ceremony in 1883 he was crowned with a circlet of gold mined from The Desoza Freehold. Thereafter Desoza was known as The Gold King of Buninyong. The Gold King title was celebrated in the township with a Gold King Festival held in February each year from 1975 to 2009. The town's wide streets were planned in expectation of further growth, however prosperity ended with the gold rush and the town reverted to a small pastoral settlement. A railway from Ballarat was opened in 1889 with the passenger station completed in 1890, although it is no longer used. The line ran from the Ballarat station stopping at Ballarat East Station, Eureka Station, Levy Siding, Canadian Station, Mount Clear Station, Reid Siding, Mt Helen Siding terminating at the Buninyong Station. Popularly named 'The Bunny' the line ceased to carry passengers in the late 1930s, and freight in 1947 when the line was closed.Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, July 1983, pp. 145‚Äì160 Buninyong's landmarks include Mount Buninyong (volcanic mountain), gardens and the many historic buildings, including the Town Hall, Crown Hotel, Holy Trinity Church among others.

It was established in 1972. In August 2005, the inhabitants of Netzarim were evicted by the Israel Defense Forces as part of Israel's unilateral disengagement plan. History It began as a secular Nahal (Young Pioneer) outpost of the Hashomer Hatzair movement; in 1984 it became an orthodox kibbutz. A few years later, the residents decided to change from a kibbutz to a village. It was often referred to in the media as a stronghold for Religious Zionism. Its activities included a mango plantation and vineyard, hothouse cultivated yams and cherry tomatoes, and a prestigious etrog plantation. The settlement also boasted day care centers, kindergartens, a primary school, a kollel, a Yeshiva, and the Jews of Gaza Heritage Institute, which documented Jewish settlement in Gaza over the generations. The development of educational institutions independent from the Gush Katif bloc was due to its isolated location and intensifying Palestinian attacks on traffic using the only route in during the al-Aqsa Intifada. During the last several years of its existence, transportation to and from Netzarim was permitted only with armed military escorts. Eviction The residents of Netzarim were the last Israelis to be evicted on August 22, 2005 by the Israel Defense Forces during Israel's unilateral disengagement plan from the Gaza Strip ordered by the government of Ariel Sharon. Their eviction marked the end of the Israeli presence in the Gaza Strip since the end of the 1967 Six-Day War. The strong religiosity of its residents was exhibited by seedlings being planted in the greenhouses, cement being laid for a new home that very morning, and a large prayer session in the main synagogue that would later be destroyed by Palestinians after the Israeli army finally abandoned the village on September 12, 2005. After the eviction, the residents, who had prided themselves in not cooperating with any government agency involved in the eviction, were welcomed in the dormitories of the College of Judea and Samaria by the school administration, students, volunteers and residents of Ariel and the surrounding West Bank settlements. Before the beginning of the academic year, the former residents of Netzarim decided to split up into two groups. One group moved to the temporary government refugee camp of Yevul near the Egyptian border. The other group decided to stay in Ariel. Operation Cast Lead IDF took possession of Netzarim again during Operation Cast Lead and entered with 150 Merkava and other military vehicles on January 4, 2009. The reoccupation of Netzarim effectively separated Gaza City from southern Gaza Strip, weakening Hamas' control of the region. On the early morning of January 12, troops stationed at Netzarim began their northward push into Gaza City's Sheikh Ajleen neighborhood. With a ceasefire declared by Israel on January 17, its soldiers gradually evacuated the site of Netzarim.

Details about his early life, motivations, and piratical exploits differ in different tellings. However, the various versions agree that he was a remarkably active pirate during Florida's second Spanish period (which spanned from 1783 until 1821), that he amassed a huge fortune by taking many prizes and ransoming many hostages, and that he died by leaping from his ship rather than face capture by the U.S. Navy, leaving behind an enormous and as-yet undiscovered treasure. Though the pirate Gaspar is a popular figure in Florida folklore, there is no evidence that he actually existed. No contemporaneous mention of his life or exploits have been found in Spanish or American ship logs, court records, newspapers, or other archives, and no physical artifacts linked to Gaspar have been discovered in the area where he supposedly established his \\"pirate kingdom.\\" The earliest known written mention of Jos√© Gaspar was a short biography included in an early 1900s promotional brochure for the Gasparilla Inn on Gasparilla Island at Charlotte Harbor, the author of which freely admitted that his dramatic tale was a work of fiction \\"without a true fact in it\\". Subsequent retellings of the Gaspar legend are based upon this fanciful account, including the accidental inclusion of Jos√© Gaspar in a 1923 book on real pirates that has caused ongoing confusion about his historical authenticity. Jos√© Gaspar's legend is celebrated in Tampa, Florida during the annual Gasparilla Pirate Festival, which was first held in 1904. Legend The story of Jos√© Gaspar's life and career vary in different tellings, especially with regard to his origin. Most agree that Gaspar was born in Spain about 1756, served in the Spanish Navy until turning to piracy about 1783, and met his end in southwest Florida during a battle against the United States Navy in late 1821. However, the retellings differ greatly in the details. =Early years= In some versions of the story, Gaspar began life as a troubled youth who kidnapped a young girl for ransom. Captured and given the choice between prison and joining the navy, he choose to go to sea, where he served with distinction for several years before leading a mutiny against a tyrannical captain and fleeing to Florida with a stolen ship. Other versions of the story state that Gaspar was a nobleman who achieved a high rank in the Spanish Royal Navy and became a councilor to King Charles III of Spain. He was popular in the court, but when he spurned one lover for another, the jilted lady levied false charges against him, often said to involve the theft of the crown jewels. Unjustly facing arrest, he commandeered a ship and fled, vowing to exact revenge on his country. In still other versions, Gaspar was a brilliant Spanish admiral of questionable character who actually succeeded in stealing the crown jewels. When his theft was discovered, he seized the \\"prize vessel of the Spanish fleet\\" with a group of loyal followers and abandoned his wife and children to flee across the Atlantic Ocean. =Piratical career= In all versions, the renegade settled along the virtually uninhabited southwest coast of Spanish Florida around 1783 and turned to piracy aboard his ship, the Floriblanca. Gaspar established a base on Gasparilla Island and was soon the feared scourge of the Gulf of Mexico and the Spanish Main, plundering dozens of ships and amassed a huge cache of treasure in the period coinciding with the second Spanish rule of Florida. Most male prisoners would be forced to join his crew or be put to death, while women would be taken to a nearby isle (called Captiva Island for this reason) to be held for ransom or serve as wives or concubines for the pirates.Bradlee, p. 54 Different versions of Gaspar's legend relate different episodes in his piratical career. One of the most famous involves a Spanish princess (or Mexican, depending on the version) named Useppa who was a passenger on a captured ship. The noble woman rejected the pirate's advances until he threatened to behead her if she would not submit to his lust. Still she refused, and he killed her in a rage (or alternately, because his crew demanded her death). Gaspar instantly regretted the deed and took her body to a nearby island, which he named Useppa in her honor, and buried her himself. Some versions identify the lady with Josefa de Mayorga, daughter of Mart√≠n de Mayorga, viceroy of New Spain from 1779 to 1782, and contend that the island's name evolved over time, though no evidence has been found in the Viceroy's surviving records to support the claim. Similarly, Sanibel Island is said to have been named by Gaspar's first mate, Rodrigo Lopez, after his lover whom he had left back in Spain. Empathizing with his friend's plight, Gaspar eventually allowed Lopez to return home. Some versions of the legend claim that Gaspar entrusted Lopez with his personal log, which has been cited as a source for information about the pirate although it has never been produced. Gaspar has been associated with various other pirates, both historical and not. Some versions of Gaspar's story claim that he often partnered with the real (alleged) pirate Pierre Lafitte, and that Lafitte barely escaped the battle in which Gaspar was killed. This is unlikely, as there is no record of Lafitte spending time on the southwest Florida coast, and he died in Mexico before Gaspar's supposed demise., p. 414 Gaspar has also been associated with Henri Caesar and \\"Old King John\\", other semi-legendary pirates for whom there is little to no historical evidence.Bradlee, p. 54-55 =Demise= Most versions of the legend agree that Jos√© Gaspar met his end in late 1821, soon after Spain transferred control of the Florida Territory to the United States.Bradlee, p. 55 Gaspar had decided to retire after almost four decades of pirating, and he and his crew gathered on Gasparilla Island to split his enormous treasure cache, which some versions of the story value at the enormous sum of $30 million. (For comparison, Spain has just agreed to transfer all of Florida to the United States for $5 million.) During the treasure distribution process, a lookout spotted what appeared to be a vulnerable British merchant ship sailing nearby. Gaspar could not resist taking one last prize, so he led his crew aboard the Floriblanca to pursue their prey. However, when the pirates fired a warning shot, their intended victim raised an American flag to reveal that it was no merchant vessel, but the United States Navy pirate hunting schooner USS Enterprise in disguise. A fierce battle ensued, and the Floriblanca was soon riddled by cannonballs and in danger of sinking. Rather than surrender, Gaspar supposedly wrapped an anchor chain around his waist and leapt from the bow, dramatically shouting \\"Gasparilla dies by his own hand, not the enemy's!\\" before plunging into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico within sight of Gasparilla Island. Most of his surviving crew were captured and hanged, but a few escaped or were imprisoned. Some versions of the story claim that one of these survivors was John G√≥mez, who would tell the tale to subsequent generations. Plausibility Though his story has been retold in many forms since its first appearance in 1900, there is no evidence that Jos√© Gaspar actually existed. Research in Spanish archives have turned up no mention of his early life, his presence in the Spanish royal court, or his career in the Spanish navy. Despite claims that he was the most feared pirate of the Gulf coast for several decades, searches of contemporary American newspapers have found no mention of the name \\"Gaspar\\" or \\"Gasparilla\\" or of a pirate ship called Floriblanca, and searches of United States Navy archives have found no mention of Gaspar in ships' logs or in official court records of the hundreds of piracy trials held during the era. While the USS Enterprise was assigned to the West Indies Squadron tasked with suppressing piracy in the Caribbean, it is documented to have been in Cuba in December 1821, not in Charlotte Harbor, where Gaspar's last battle is said to have taken place. There is also no physical evidence to support Gaspar's existence. Though some versions of the story claim that Gaspar's \\"regal\\" home base on Gasparilla Island consisted of a dozen or more buildings plus a tall watchtower built atop an ancient Calusa mound, no trace of his \\"pirate kingdom\\" has ever been discovered despite the fact that much of the island has been developed into the tourist town of Boca Grande. And while professional and amateur treasure hunters have conducted many searches for Gaspar's plundered treasure over the years encouraged by rumors of mysterious maps and found gold coins, there has been no documented recovery of any part his lost cache. Treasure hunters have, however, disrupted many archeological sites, often in violation of Florida law. The Boca Grande Historical Society reported that Calusa and other Native America sites in the Charlotte Harbor area have suffered \\"unimaginable damage\\" at the hands of \\"looters in search of a non-pirate's non-treasure.\\" Sources of the legend \\"Panther John\\" G√≥mez from Forest and Stream Magazine =John G√≥mez= John G√≥mez (also known as Juan G√≥mez and Panther John) was a real person who has become entangled with the legend of Jos√© Gaspar. In the late 1800s, G√≥mez lived in a shack with his wife on otherwise uninhabited Panther Key, a small island near Marco Island in the Ten Thousand Islands region of Southwest Florida. He was well known along Florida's Gulf coast as an expert hunting and fishing guide, boat pilot, and an eccentric teller of tall tales, mostly about himself. His self-reported age and birthplace varied, even on official documents. In the 1870 United States Census, he is listed as having been born in 1828. However, during the 1880 US census, G√≥mez claimed to have been born in France in 1785U.S. Census, Monroe Co., Florida, Supervisor's district 18, enumerator's district 118, page 8, 6 July 1880. In 1885, he told state census takers that he had been born in CorsicaFlorida State Census, Monroe county, enumerator's district 7, page 11, 22 June 1885, and reported to the 1900 US Census that he was born in Portugal in 1776.U.S. Census, Precinct 7, Lee Co., Florida, 27 June 1900, supervisor's district 2, enumerator district 163, sheet 2 Meanwhile, various contemporary letters and news articles report that G√≥mez claimed at different times to have been born in 1778, 1781 or 1795 in Honduras, Portugal, or Mauritius. Most of his supposed birth years would have likely made him the oldest person in the world before his death. G√≥mez's uncertain birth was said to be just the beginning of an exceedingly long and adventure-filled life. He claimed to have seen Napoleon as a youth in France (or, alternatively, was drafted into Napoleon's army), sailed the world as a cabin boy on a merchant ship, served as a scout for the U.S. Army during the Seminole Wars, served as a coastal pilot for the U.S. Navy during the Civil War, was involved in filibustering (and perhaps pirating) in Central America and the Caribbean, and escaped scheduled execution in a Cuban prison to return to Florida, among other remarkable exploits spread out over an entire century. While none of these stories can be verified, G√≥mez is documented to have lived in various locations across west and southwest Florida from about 1870 until his death, including the Florida Everglades, Key West, Tampa. Pass-a-Grille, and the Ten Thousand Islands. Between his eccentricly entertaining tall tales and his real skills as a boat pilot and fishing guide, G√≥mez was mentioned several times in Forest and Stream, an early conservationist and outdoorsman magazine. G√≥mez's stories were usually shared in very informal settings, such as around a campfire during a fishing trip or hunting expedition. They are documented only in a few contemporary personal letters, magazine articles, and obituaries, with the details differing and often conflicting from listener to listener. However, though many versions of the Gaspar legend claim that G√≥mez was the last surviving member of the legendary pirate's crew, no contemporary account of G√≥mez's life or tall tales mention the name Jos√© Gaspar. The connection was first made soon after his death in 1900, when a promotional pamphlet for a Charlotte Harbor resort hotel (see below) claimed that the late John G√≥mez was the primary source of its tale of the pirate Gasparilla. Since then, many elaborate and often conflicting stories have been told regarding G√≥mez's alleged exploits alongside Jos√© Gaspar. Some claim that G√≥mez was the pirate's cabin boy, others that he was the Floriblanca's first mate, others that he was Gaspar's brother-in-law, still others that G√≥mez was Gaspar's first mate while his son, John Jr., was the cabin boy, and some even suggesting that G√≥mez actually was the retired pirate Gaspar hiding under a false name. Most versions of the legend also claim that, despite the fact that he was so poor that he petitioned the Lee County Commission for a $8 per month stipend, G√≥mez knew the whereabouts of Gaspar's vast treasure cache supposedly hidden in the Charlotte Harbor area. =Gasparilla Inn Brochure= 1774 English map featuring the names Gasparilla and Captiva well before Gaspar's supposed arrival in the area The first known written account of Jos√© Gaspar comes from an early 1900s brochure for the Gasparilla Inn Resort in the recently established tourist town of Boca Grande, Florida on Gasparilla Island in Charlotte Harbor. It was authored by publicist Pat Lemoyne for the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway Company, which owned the resort. The brochure consisted of two parts: the legend of Jos√© Gaspar followed by a promotional section touting the Gasparilla Inn, the railroad which served Boca Grande, and the Charlotte Harbor area in general. It was freely distributed to guests at the Inn and in northern markets to draw attention to the recently opened tourist destination. The cover of the brochure featured a blood- dripping illustration of Gaspar, and the introduction claimed that the tale of the pirate contained therein was gleaned from stories told by the recently deceased John G√≥mez, who was described as the longest-lived member the crew. Several episodes in Gaspar's career first mentioned in the brochure have been repeated and expanded upon in later retellings, including the tale of the \\"little Spanish princess\\" and the details of his dramatic demise. It also sought to connect Gaspar to Charlotte Harbor by claiming that his sprawling home base had encompassed several islands in the area. Captiva Island was said to be where his captives were held, Sanibel Island was named after Gaspar's love interest, and his home was on Gasparilla Island - \\"Taking the best of everything when a capture was made, he chose the best of the islands in Charlotte Harbor for his own secret haunts,\\" it declared. Finally, it claimed that a burial mound \\"forty feet high and four hundred feet in circumference\\" near Gasparilla Island had been found to contain \\"ornaments of gold and silver\\" along with \\"hundreds of human skeletons\\", but that the bulk of the buccaneer's vast cache of buried treasure \\"still lies unmoved\\" nearby, in the vicinity of the Gasparilla Inn. Though the brochure presents its history of the pirate Gaspar as established fact, there is no evidence to support the story. For example, local place names supposedly inspired by Jos√© Gaspar appeared on maps drawn long before the pirate was said to have arrived in the area, with historical documents stating that Gasparilla Island was named for Friar Gaspar, a Spanish missionary who visited the native Calusa in the 1600s. It claimed that the nickname \\"Gasparilla\\" means \\"Gaspar, the outlaw\\" in Spanish when it is actually a feminine diminuation meaning \\"little Gaspar\\", an unlikely moniker for a bloodthirsty buccaneer. And despite the brochure's lurid tales about the discovery of gold and skeletons, no such artifacts or any other physical evidence of Gaspar's \\"regal\\" home base, victims, or treasure has ever been found on Gasparilla Island or anywhere else in the Charlotte Harbor area. In 1949, a retired Pat Lemoyne gave a local history lecture at a Fort Myers Chamber of Commerce function in which he admitted that his story of Jos√© Gaspar was a \\"cockeyed lie without a true fact in it\\" and that he had written the brochure in a dramatic style that \\"tourists like to hear\\". He further explained that it actually had been inspired by tall tales attributed to the colorful John G√≥mez, whom Lemoyne said claimed to have been a pirate and was known to sell fake treasure maps to \\"the gullible\\" for a \\"fancy figure\\". =Piracy in the West Indies and Its Suppression= In 1923, a Boston historian named Francis B. C. Bradlee received a copy of the Gasparilla Inn brochure from Robert Bradley, then president of the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway Company.Bradlee, p. 52 Assuming that the story of Gasparilla as described in the pamphlet was authentic, Bradlee included Jos√© Gaspar in a book that he was writing about piracy, Piracy In The West Indies And Its Suppression. Bradlee included details from the brochure which were clearly incorrect, including the claims that a \\"burying ground\\" containing the \\"bleached bones\\" of Gaspar's many victims had recently been discovered on Gasparilla Island, that a tall \\"burial mound\\" built by a \\"prehistoric race\\" had been excavated and found to be full of gold and silver artifacts along with \\"hundreds of human skeletons\\", and that a dying John G√≥mez had confessed to witnessing Gaspar's murder of a \\"Little Spanish princess\\" and sketched a map that led searchers to her body.Bradley, p. 53, 54 However, none of these claims were true, as no treasure, murder victims, or other physical trace of Gaspar's exploits has ever been found in the area, and John G√≥mez drowned in a boating accident, making a deathbed confession implausible. Despite his obvious lack of fact-checking, Bradlee's book was used as a source for later works such as Philip Gosse's Pirates' Who's Who and Frederick W. Dau's Florida Old and New, the authors of which also took Gaspar's authenticity for granted. Over the next few decades, several more books about pirates or Florida history erroneously included Jos√© Gaspar / Gasparilla as a real historical figure, leading to continuing confusion about the authenticity of his story and repeated attempts to find his lost treasure. =Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla= Inspired by the story of Gaspar, the city of Tampa organized a Gasparilla-themed May Day festival in 1904. The event proved popular, and several local leaders organized a krewe called Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla (YMKG) to run the festivities, which became known as the Gasparilla Pirate Festival. In 1936, YMKG, commissioned Tampa Tribune editor Edwin D. Lambright to write an authorized history of the Krewe. The volume included a version of the legend of Jos√© Gaspar in which he was a more \\"respectable\\" and \\"courtly\\" pirate who resorted to violence only when absolutely necessary. Lambright claimed that his account was supported by \\"unquestionable records\\", including a diary written by Gaspar himself and secreted to Spain by a member of his crew, perhaps Juan G√≥mez. However, the diary was said to have been lost, and no other evidence was disclosed. In 2004, YMKG published a new centennial history of the organization. This document basically recounts the Gasparilla legend first published in 1936, but adds a coda which concedes that scholarly research conducted in both Spanish and American archives has not uncovered any evidence of Gaspar's existence. The history concludes with this statement: > Whether Gasparilla, the pirate, actually existed or not is a moot point. The > legend exists, and that's what matters. The story of Gasparilla and his > pirates has lent a certain flair of mystery and adventure to Florida's West > Coast since the late 1800s. And on that legend, Ye Mystic Krewe of > Gasparilla was founded 100 years ago. =\\"The Gasparilla Story\\"= In 1949, Fort Myers author Jack Beater published a mass-market paperback version of the Gaspar legend called The Gasparilla Story. Though written in the style of a light adventure novel, the narrator claimed that the story was true and had been by verified with a \\"mouse-eaten Cuban manuscript\\" supposedly written by Jos√© Gaspar's cousin Leon and an old map found in a used book store, neither of which were made public. The book also included advertisements for hotels and real estate firms in the Fort Myers and Charlotte Harbor area and invited readers to ‚ÄúMake [their] conquest of Sanibel and Captiva Islands . . . in the manner of the buccaneers!\\" Beater published several additional books about Gaspar and other Florida pirates; some marketed as fiction, some as non-fiction, and some as a mix of guide book and tale tales. His works and the writings of other local authors with similar themes served to further expand the story of Gaspar while also sowing confusion about the veracity of the legend. =\\"The Hand of Gasparilla\\"= Box allegedly containing Gaspar's hand and related items In the 1930s, construction worker Ernesto Lopez showed his family a mysterious box that he claimed to have found while working with a repair crew on the Cass Street Bridge in downtown Tampa. According to family legend, the wooden box contained a pile of Spanish and Portuguese coins, a severed hand wearing a ring engraved with the name \\"Gaspar\\", and a \\"treasure map\\" indicating that Gaspar's treasure was hidden near the Hillsborough River in Tampa. In 2015, Lopez's great- grandchildren rediscovered a box in their late grandfather's attic containing the items Ernesto Lopez had found plus what appeared to be his wedding photo. The family brought the box to the attention of a local reporter, whose TV news report on the strange find was picked up by several national and international news outlets. However, upon examination, experts at the Tampa Bay History Center determined that the box contained several non-precious old coins, souvenirs from early Gasparilla parades, and a plat map from the 1920s with local streets, businesses, and landmarks from that time clearly depicted. The origin of the hand remained a mystery, though the curator of the history center opined that it might be a mummified monkey hand. Legacy The pirate ship Jos√© Gasparilla sailing into downtown Tampa to begin the Gasparilla parade =Gasparilla Pirate Festival= In 1904, members of the Tampa business elite staged a surprise pirate \\"invasion\\" during the city's previously sedate May Day celebration. Under the guise of \\"Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla\\" (YMKG), an organization modeled after the New Orleans Mardi Gras parade krewes, the \\"invaders\\" donned pirate costumes and rode through the streets on horseback and encouraging residents to follow them to the festivities. The event was a hit, and the following year, the Krewe organized a parade in which all 60 of Tampa's cars rode through downtown. The first seaborne \\"invasion\\" came in 1911, and YMKG has organized a theatrical pirate invasion and parade almost every year since.1999 Gasparilla Pirate Fest - The Tampa Tribune Tampa now hosts many community events during its \\"Gasparilla Season\\", which runs approximately from January to March. The focal point is still an \\"invasion\\" by Jos√© Gaspar and his crew, which takes place on the last Saturday in January. Members of Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla, accompanied by a flotilla of hundreds of private boats, sail across Tampa Bay to downtown Tampa on the Jos√© Gasparilla, a 165' long \\"pirate\\" ship which was specially built for this purpose in 1954.The History of Gasparilla Pirate Fest - Tampa, Florida The mayor of Tampa then surrenders the key of the city to the \\"pirate captain\\", and a \\"victory parade\\" ensues down Bayshore Boulevard. Dozens of other Krewes have joined the festivities over the years, which has grown into of one of the largest parades in the United States. An average of over 300,000 people attend the event, which contributes over $20 million to the local economy.Gasparillapiratefest.com Retrieved April 3, 2006. =Cultural connections= *The names \\"Gaspar\\" or \\"Gasparilla\\" are used by many businesses, organizations, and events in the greater Tampa Bay area, while others have names inspired by the mythical pirate. One notable example is the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League, who began play in 1976 with a nickname inspired by the well-known local legend.Awosika, Mary, and Mark Zaloude. \\"Pirate State (of mind); When bad boys make for good fun: Pirates have shed their villainous image in Florida\\". Sarasota Herald-Tribune. 3 February 2003 Another sports-related example is the Gasparilla Bowl, a college football bowl game once played in Tropicana Field as the \\"St. Petersburg Bowl\\" that changed its name when it moved to Tampa in 2018. *The legend of Gasparilla has been featured in several television shows and publications over the years. Recent examples include September 2019 episodes of the TV series Expedition Unknown on the Discovery Channel and Code of the Wild on the Travel Channel, both of which followed amateur treasure hunters (unsuccessfully) searching for Gaspar's treasure in the Charlotte Harbor area.

KOR was an example of successful social organizing based on specific issues relevant to the public's daily lives. It was a precursor and inspiration for efforts of the Solidarity trade union a few years later. It was established in September 1976 by Antoni Macierewicz and Piotr Naimski. A year later it was reorganized into the Committee for Social Self-defence KOR (Komitet Samoobrony Spo≈Çecznej KOR). History This organization was the first major anti-communist civic group in Poland, as well as Eastern Europe. It was born of the outrage at the government's crackdown in June 1976. Its stated purpose was to create \\"new centers of autonomous activity.\\" It raised money through sales of its underground publications, through fund-raising groups in Paris and London, and grants from Western institutions. KOR sent open letters of protest to the government and organized legal and financial support for the families of political detainees. The leaders of the organization established an activities and coordination center and offered analysis on workers‚Äô conditions within Poland. They often collaborated with Western journalists on writing and publishing articles. The group worked with sympathetic lawyers to get better representation for striking workers and obtained medical diagnoses from doctors which they presented as evidence of police brutality in court trials. The group smuggled in mimeograph machines to print its underground newsletter, Komunikat, which had a circulation of around 20,000 by 1978. As a side project of KOR, an underground publishing house called NOWA was founded using mimeograph machines owned by KOR. It printed material critical of the regime and reproduce banned writings from thinkers outside of the Warsaw Pact countries, such as George Orwell. NOWA had its own print shops, storehouses, and distribution network, and financed itself through sales and contributions. In the fall of 1977 KOR collaborated with Warsaw intellectuals to establish the Flying University, a series of lectures organized by unofficial student groups to discuss ideas about freedom that could not be debated in public. The government harassed KOR members as it did other civil society groups in Poland: beating up and jailing dissidents, infiltrating and interrupting lectures, and conducting searches of dissidents‚Äô houses. However, KOR became an inspiration for the nation as its efforts finally paid off when the Polish government declared an amnesty for jailed strikers in the spring of 1977. In that year, it was renamed the Committee for Social Self-defence KOR (Komitet Samoobrony Spo≈Çecznej KOR). KOR went on to publish another underground paper, Robotnik (\\"The Worker\\"--the same title as J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's underground paper) Legacy The organization is often forgotten in the wake of Solidarity's success in the 1980s, but KOR remained an important force in bringing down communism in Poland.

Ford. It expands upon the campaign setting of conflict between the Infinity Patrol, which is the dimension- jumping agency on \\"our\\" Earth, referred to as Homeline, and Centrum across a multiplicity of alternate history Earths. This was presented in the Fourth Edition GURPS Basic Set (and originated in the Third Edition supplements GURPS Time Travel, GURPS Alternate Earths, and GURPS Alternate Earths II). Contents GURPS Infinite Worlds builds on the genre-hopping possibilities of player characters travelling from one world to another for the fourth edition of GURPS. GURPS Infinite Worlds has eight chapters: Infinity Unlimited, Enemies Everywhen, Present at the Creation, Worlds Enough, ...And Time, Infinite characters, Infinite Campaigns, and Alternate Infinities. =Infinity Unlimited= This chapter describes one of the two worlds (known locally as Homeline) that have full-fledged, public \\"parachronics\\" programs (the technology behind traveling between parallel universes) Travel between worlds is generally done through ground-based equipment (\\"projectors\\") or vehicles (\\"conveyors\\"), but magic, parahuman abilities and even stranger methods can and have been utilized by both. Alternate worlds (also known as realities or worldlines) are grouped into \\"quanta\\", which have varying degrees of ease of access not only to Homeline but to her opponents =Enemies Everywhen= This is the chapter that describes Homeline's adversaries and hazards. The major adversary is Centrum, the only other reality known to have a public parachronics program, who can be played as a deadly adversary, occasional opponents or grudging allies depending on the GM's preference. The secondary adversary is Reich-5, the worst of the five known 'Nazis win/survive WWII' realities in the setting. An ill-advised raid by Spetsnaz troops from Homeline Russia resulted in the capture of a troop conveyor, a handful of live prisoners, and the corpse of a scout with a genetically-linked psionic world- jumping ability. A quick-thinking local Brigadef√ºhrer made a deal with the mystical SS society of the Ahnenerbe to take possession of the booty (and to keep it all secret from the mainstream Nazi hierarchy); Reich-5 scientists and sorcerers are using occult rituals and horrific medical experiments to slowly spread their Thousand Year Reich to other realities. =Present at the Creation= This chapter describes how to create your own alternate reality and offering inspirational concepts to look at such as the Great Man, Great Moment, and Great Motherland. =Worlds Enough= This is the chapter on some of the alternate worlds in the setting. Reich-5, Caliph, Dixie, Ezcalli, Gernsback, Roma Aeterna, and Shikaku-Mon all appeared in slightly different forms in the older Alternate Earths volumes. Armada-2 So named because it is the second world discovered by the Infinity Patrol in which the Spanish Armada was victorious over the English in 1588, Armada-2 is a world just now (in \\"current year\\" 1812) emerging from the shadow of Catholic Spanish hegemony, with Sweden, an industrialised Egypt and Huguenot Nouvelle France as other powers. Attila A parallel where city-razing Mongol hordes under Genghis Khan destroyed first Beijing and then all the cities of Europe, where now their descendants (in \\"current year\\" 2004) rule an entirely nomadic continent. The world was mistakenly named for Attila the Hun by early Infinity Patrol researchers who were confused as to which nomadic leader was responsible for the destruction. Meanwhile, Japan trades across the Pacific Ocean with the urbanized tribes of North and South America, and city-states dot Africa, where steam engines have just been developed. Azoth-7 When Isaac Newton discovered the secret of the philosopher's stone in 1693, he paved the way for an Alchemical Revolution that has left Azoth-7 dominated by the magical might of Britain, Venice, Prussia, and Spain by \\"current year\\" 1780. Notable for having space travel - though whatever Polaris and Sirius may be, they are not balls of hydrogen tens or hundreds of light-years away from Earth. (The Rivers of London series is also based on the premise of a magical Isaac Newton) Bonaparte-4 In Bonaparte-4, Napoleon sacrificed the romance of an Egyptian campaign (which he conducted in 1798 in our timeline) for a stealthy invasion of Ireland, granting him victory over Britain. By \\"current year\\" 2024, the world is divided between French, Japanese, Russian, and Brazilian Empires, along with the United States and the Russian Republic, and the world has achieved a stage of technological achievement and social disaffection and tension reminiscent of cyberpunk. Britannica-3 The success of the rebellion of James, Duke of Monmouth against James II of England in 1685 is the point of divergence between our own world and Britannica-3; wiser and more Protestant rule in Britain meant that tensions with the North American colonies never reached the point of rebellion as they did in real history. Despite the rise of other strong European powers, the world is free of major conflicts, which can be attributed to the strong influence of Centrum in this parallel. Caliph In this world the printing press was invented in Baghdad in 796 and was shortly followed by the widespread adaptation of the scientific method and an oil-based industrial revolution. The current year here is 1684, but the technological acceleration stemming from these changes has resulted in a society seemingly centuries ahead of Homeline. Unfortunately a burgeoning global war between the tradition-minded major states (Sofala, Persia, Andalus, the Bulgarian Caliphate and the Ummah) and the technocratic Jamahiriya of the western continents threatens the existence of this advanced society. Campbell Named for the early death of influential science fiction editor John W. Campbell which occurred in this parallel but not in real history, Campbell is a world notable for the poverty of its scientific advancement. While military applications of scientific research advanced rapidly enough, science as an intellectual pursuit became associated exclusively with death, destruction, and catastrophe (especially after World War II ended with the bombardment of Germany with radioactive dust, killing hundreds of thousands of people). This led to an anti-scientific wave of pacifist Luddism and charismatic religious revival in the 1960s. Lacking the positive fruits of scientific inquiry, the world heads (in \\"current year\\" 2004) through ecological disaster and failing economies to a nigh-inevitable showdown between its capitalist and communist societies. Centrum The nominal villains of the campaign, Centrum is a totalitarian, homogenized world-state, and the only world other than Homeline to have a major parachronic program. Its point of departure was in 1120, when the White Ship carrying William the Aetheling, the heir of Henry I of England, did not hit a rock in the English Channel. William's survival precluded The Anarchy and the Hundred Years War, and ultimately the \\"Anglo-French Empire\\" became a world-spanning power, with technological progress centuries beyond that of Homeline. However unbearable tensions existed just below the surface, and in 1902 unknown parties decapitated the ruling house by detonating a nuclear device in London. The resulting succession wars included nuclear and biological weapons, wiped out much of humanity and reduced most of the survivors to preindustrial barbarism. But Terraustralis (Homeline Australia) escaped much of the destruction, and the techno-military cabal known as \\"The Centrum\\" that took control there ultimately extended its authority across the globe. Centrum is a socialist technocratic meritocracy; the government provides all employment and handles the economy, which is bolstered by the massive resources acquired from other worldlines. They believe other worlds should be aiming to follow their example and have a dedicated program of supporting political and economic groups that reflect their own values‚Äîstability, meritocracy and an unconscious prejudice against non-English speakers. They view the mix of competing government agencies and private companies from Homeline as dangerously reminiscent of the period prior to their own \\"Final War\\". Centrum Beta One of the most important parallel Earths from the Infinity Patrol's point of view, Centrum Beta appears to be an exact copy of the home parallel of Centrum - except that the \\"current year\\" is only 1895. Understanding Centrum Beta as it is now might give the Infinity Patrol the key to understanding and besting Centrum proper. Deadly Settings Also known generally as \\"Reality Vanish\\", there are at least 41 parachronic coordinate settings where people or objects sent into them never return. These are assumed to be worlds where the laws of physics are sufficiently different from that of our own universe to kill visitors and/or cripple their equipment (see Rustic under Puzzle Worlds, below). Dixie-1 In this world, William Walker succeeded in conquering Nicaragua in 1856; during the American Civil War this provided a way around the Union blockade for the Confederacy that ultimately ensured their victory. In revenge for British support of the rebels, the United States invaded and annexed most of Canada; meanwhile the Southrons reintroduced their \\"peculiar institution\\" into Central America and the Caribbean at gunpoint. Today (\\"current year\\" 1993) the U.S.A. and C.S.A. watch each other warily across an armed border that stretches to the Pacific, while India, the Chinese republics and their neighbors expand their economies at the expense of the moribund European monarchies that never fell after 1918. (See American Civil War alternate histories). Ezcalli Here the Columbian Exchange occurred two thousand years early, when a Carthaginian fleet was blown across the Atlantic to discover the New World. This premature contact gave the Native American civilizations time to recover from the shock of new diseases and adopt the newcomers' technology; in addition, the early introduction of maize and the potato to the Old World eventually reduced Rome's ability to control its subjects through Egyptian grain. The Empire ended with Nero, and the patchwork of European successor states were ill-equipped to resist subsequent barbarian invasions. In the \\"current year\\" of 1848, the expansionist, steam-powered Tenochca Empire faces off against the Hotinohsavannih League to the north and the Songhay Empire (the last remnant of Roman culture) to the east; whoever wins is likely fated to take on the somnolent but fearsomely large Mongol Khaganate that covers most of Eurasia. Friedrich This parallel world is named for the Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich I Barbarossa, who in this timeline managed to be the great imperial unifier and conqueror that the vagaries of fortune prevented him from being in our history. In \\"current year\\" 1219, seventeen years after his death, Friedrich is notable for being a hotbed of activity by the SS Raven Division from the Nazi-dominated parallel Reich-5, who seek to turn his Holy Roman Empire into a First Reich and breeding ground for Aryan warriors. Gallatin Gallatin is named for Albert Gallatin, the dominant member of Thomas Jefferson's government due to Alexander Hamilton having died in the Battle of Trenton. Without Hamilton to defend and explain the United States Constitution in the Federalist Papers, it was never ratified and the independent colonies balkanized into nine separate republics across the continent by 1860. In \\"current year\\" 2004, Gallatin's great powers include Texas (whose nuclear arsenal shields the other libertarian American republics), German-dominated Europaverein, the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Japanese Empire; peace is maintained by the fear of mutual destruction in an atomic war. Gernsback This parallel world is named after editor Hugo Gernsback, due to the futuristic architecture and technology being used there. The divergence happened in 1893, when Nikola Tesla married Anne Morgan, daughter of millionaire and philanthropist J. P. Morgan, an event that helped him to stabilize his life and make many of his inventions reality thanks to the support of his father-in-law. In 1902, he created a radio tower that broadcast to the entire world from Long Island, and he later managed to develop wireless electricity broadcasting, which eventually helped Germany to stabilize and avoid falling under the control of Adolf Hitler and Nazism, and strengthening the League of Nations, avoiding World War II. When, in 1951, Andrei Sakharov managed to defect to the West and tell of Stalin's plans to create atomic weapons, the League of Nations declared war on the Soviet Union, which fell on April 30, 1953, with the death of Joseph Stalin. In \\"current year\\" 1965, the World Science Council and the League of Nations are putting down all threats to the techno-utopia that has resulted from the inventions derived from Tesla's work. However, this is a world where race and sex discrimination still run rampant. The main mission of the I-Cops in here is to prevent Centrum from taking over, as Centrum regards Gernsback as a potential ally. Hell Worlds Many timelines have suffered catastrophes (some natural, others man-made) that have rendered humanity either extinct or nearly so. These are colloquially known as the \\"hell worlds\\". Examples include Ariane (where the Spanish flu killed 99.9% of the population), Lenin-2 (where nuclear war and unconstrained industry have combined to crash the biosphere) and the worrisome Gotha parallels (where a prion-based disease has turned almost all humans into bloodthirsty cannibals on 19 otherwise dissimilar worlds). Homeline The main world in the game. The world of \\"our\\" timeline (apart from the development of parachronics) and home base of Infinity Patrol, and of players in the game. Seeks to counteract Centrum and its efforts to interfere with natural development of alternate worlds. Lenin-1 Here Franklin D. Roosevelt maintained Henry A. Wallace as his vice president when he was reelected in 1944; consequently Wallace became president on April 12, 1945 upon Roosevelt's death. His passive stance (and that of his successors) against the Soviet Union resulted in the steady expansion of Communism across the globe. In the \\"current year\\" of 1989, the isolated and malaise-stricken United States is essentially the sole remaining capitalist country on the planet. Merlin-1 Named after the wizard of that name, Merlin-1 is a world where magic entered the world due to the Trinity nuclear test in August 1945. In \\"current year\\" 2004 America (where much of the magic is centred) uses both magic and technology to be the dominant superpower. Homeline has begun investigating this world to obtain information about this mana-rich reality, but unbeknownst to them the Merlin-1 American government is aware of their actions and has begun spying on them in return. The setting of GURPS Technomancer. Merlin-3 A world where magic entered the world in 1916, and is centered in Germany. In \\"current year\\" 1942, World War II is being fought with magic. The setting of GURPS WWII: Weird War II. Myth Parallels Many worlds have inhabitants that closely resemble characters from the myths, legends and stories of Homeline. The characters from the Arabian Nights stories, three different King Arthurs (Riothamus, the Vulgate Cycle Arthur, and Thomas Malory's version) and Sherlock Holmes are all represented by various worlds, along with hundreds of others. Nergal Shalmaneser III of Assyria wiped out Jerusalem and Tyre in this world in 854 B.C., and his successors destroyed the Greek city-states a century later. In the \\"current year\\" of 1678, various empires based on slavery and human sacrifice cover the globe (except for an Infinity Patrol-supported haven in southern Africa) while an anomalous ice age threatens to wipe out those unfortunate to live in a world where monotheism, democracy and the Greek and Latin alphabets were destroyed almost before they could begin. Puzzle Worlds Some worlds that do not follow the generally accepted laws of physics in one way or another or otherwise demonstrate unusual characteristics‚Äîit is important to note that in the Infinite Worlds setting, most magic fits under the category of \\"accepted laws of physics\\". Rustic (where artificial electric discharges are impossible to generate), Enigma (where the entire population of the world disappeared on July 12, 1982) and Blip (where one day spent there is equal to a little over six minutes on other worlds) are some examples. Reich-5 Widely regarded as one of the most disturbing and potentially dangerous worlds so far discovered, in this parallel Giuseppe Zangara succeeded in assassinating Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1933. His successors Garner, Lindbergh and Wallace proved unable to handle the Great Depression, and America stood by while Hitler conquered Europe and Japan took over most of Asia. In 1944, Japan attacked Guam, the Philippines and Hawaii; in the ensuing chaos William Dudley Pelley was elected President. Pelley quickly assumed dictatorial powers, and his blatant theft of the 1948 election from Robert A. Taft triggered wholesale civil war. The president called for aid from Nazi Germany, which quickly sent 40 Wehrmacht divisions through Canada. The pro-democracy resistance collapsed after Werner Heisenberg developed the atomic bomb which was used on four American cities in 1950. A second attempt at rebellion in 1976 failed, and America is now a (very) junior partner of the World-Axis that dominates the planet. Reich-5's technology (military or otherwise) is superior to that of any Homeline country, and despite being the only known timeline besides Homeline and Centrum to possess world-jumping technology, their parachronic program is well behind those of the other two. Roma √Üterna Here Nero Claudius Drusus did not die in 9 B.C. In turn, he became the successor to Augustus instead of Tiberius. The imperial line that followed was so successful that when the First Empire fell apart in the 5th century the guiding ideals of Rome were never discarded and were ultimately restored. After the Mongol invasions broke the Second Empire in the 14th century, colonies in the Hesperides preserved these ideals in turn and ultimately re-restored the empire in the late 18th century. The \\"current year\\" is 1893, and the musket-wielding legions of the Third Empire are found from the Magna Campania to the Ganges, with no sign of retreating anytime soon. Shikaku-Mon In this \\"four-cornered world\\" Juan, Prince of Asturias, the son of King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella of Spain survived to take the Spanish throne as King John III. The resulting changes in history spread all the way to Japan, where an increased Jesuit presence prolonged the life of Oda Nobunaga and prevented the closing of the country by the Tokugawa shogunate. In the resulting cyberpunk \\"current year\\" of 2027, the dominant powers include a Japanese Empire that covers China, India, New Zealand, and much of East Asia, the economic superpower of Brazil, the totalitarian Swedish Empire and the technologically advanced Kingdom of France. United States of Lizardia A world very similar to our own, except reptilian creatures descended from a species of Troodon are the dominant sentient lifeform. The similarities exist down to cultural and political divisions (resulting in this world's colloquial name) and are assumed by Homeline scientists to be evidence of a \\"law of temporal inertia\\" (or \\"gods with a strange sense of humour\\"). Yrth A fantasy world, inhabited by humans, dwarves, elves etc., all of whom have been involuntarily taken from other worldlines. The setting of GURPS Banestorm. =...

Career Born in Huntington, New York, Purtill dropped out of high school and started his career as a freelance drummer in New York Studios. At the age of 20, he was with the band of Red Norvo at the beginning of 1936. Later he joined Mildred Bailey. He played briefly with Miller in 1937, then worked with Tommy Dorsey in 1938-39 before picking up with Miller again from 1939-1942, when Miller had the bulk of his hits. After the breakup of Miller's band in 1942, Purtill played with Kay Kyser until 1944, then joined the U.S. Navy. After his discharge, he played briefly in 1946 with the reformed Glenn Miller Orchestra directed by Tex Beneke. Purtill went on to record in the studio on various projects. He participated in a few Miller reunions, although he did not like to discuss his time in the band. He was good friends with Buddy Rich, Trigger Alpert and saxophonist Jack Palmer. Purtill lived in New York City until the early 1970s when he moved to Sarasota, Florida. Moe Purtill retired in 1978. He died at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, New Jersey.

Classification This genus belongs to the enantiornithine family Avisauridae, which also contains similar animals from South America such as Soroavisaurus Chiappe, Luis M.

In the Late Cretaceous the Americas were still separated by a branch of the Tethys Ocean. Avisaurus archibaldi was discovered in the Late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation of North America (Maastrichtian, from c.70.6-66 million years ago), making it one of the last enantiornithids. It was collected in 1975 in the UCMP locality V73097, in Garfield County, Montana, USA. The holotype is represented by a single fossil of a tarsometatarsus in the collection of the University of California Museum of Paleontology. It has the catalog number UCMP 117600. It was initially described as the left tarsometatarsus of a non-avian theropod by Brett-Surman and Paul in 1985. It was later redescribed as the right tarsometatarsus of an enantiornithine bird by Chiappe in 1992.Chiappe, Luis M.

PeerJ 6:e5910 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.5910 The Brett- Surman paper The paper by Brett-Surman and Paul in 1985 explicitly considered the possibility that A. archibaldi was an enantiornithine. The authors described and named UCMP 117600 formally, but they looked at other enantiornithine material, including the \\"metatarsus\\" PVL 4690 from Argentina. The authors assigned this latter fossil to Avisaurus sp. From this they concluded that members of the genus Avisaurus existed in both North and South America in the Late Cretaceous. Moreover, the authors concluded that the length/width ratio and degree of metacarpal fusion of these bones were more like those of non ‚Äî avian dinosaurs. A terrestrial dinosaur genus in both continents would then support Brett ‚Äî Surman's theory that there had been a land connection between the two continents.Brett-Surman, Michael K., Paul, Gregory S. (1985) \\"A new family of bird-like dinosaurs linking Laurasia and Gondwanaland.\\" \\"Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology\\" 5(2): 133-138. Further discoveries and further study by Chiappe showed that all of the material belonged to enantiornithine birds, and PVL 4690 was given its own genus Soroavisaurus.

It is owned by Estrella Media and airs a Regional Mexican radio format. Studios and offices are on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. KBUE's transmitter is off East University Avenue in Compton, California.Radio- Locator.com/WBUE It has an effective radiated power of 3,000 watts, making it a Class A station. Most other major Los Angeles area stations have more powerful Class B signals with their towers high up on Mount Wilson. To fill in gaps in KBUE's coverage area, \\"Que Buena\\" is also simulcasted on co-owned and co-channel 94.3 KBUA in San Fernando, and KEBN in Garden Grove. History =105.5 FM= A Federal Communications Commission construction permit for 105.5 FM was issued to Saul Levine in 1957 as KBCA. However, Levine did not get the station built, even though he would go on to own KKGO and other California stations. Finally, on New Year's Day, 1961, KLFM signed on the air.Broadcasting Yearbook 1965 page B-16 It was owned by the Harriscope Music Corporation, with Bert Harris serving as president and general manager. The station was initially powered at only 330 watts, keeping its signal restricted to Long Beach and adjacent communities. KLFM's studios were initially located in a trailer adjacent to its transmitter on Signal Hill, moving to Lakewood Center and then to 4406 Greenmeadow Road. KLFM played Top 40 hits in an era where most young people used AM radios to hear their music. In the 1960s, most FM stations simply simulcast their co-owned AM stations, or played easy listening or classical music, often using broadcast automation. Harriscope sold KLFM in 1966 to the McCray Broadcasting Company, headed by W. Mike McCray, Carl C. Loucks, and Robert Switzer.FCC History Cards for KBUE McCray changed the call sign to KNAC and instituted a full-time Middle of the Road (MOR) format. The next year, the International Cities Broadcasting Corporation bought KNAC and increased its power to 2,100 watts. Additionally, KNAC relocated to the International Tower in downtown Long Beach. In late 1967, the station began programming progressive rock from 6pm to 6am. The programming proved successful enough to make the rock format full time by 1969, when Harden Broadcasting bought KNAC. Air talent at KNAC during this era included Jim Ladd (later of KLOS), Jerry Longden (later of KROQ) and Program Director Ron McCoy. Ladd left KNAC to work for KLOS in 1971, while McCoy stayed on through much of the 1970s. The station stayed with progressive rock until 1980, when it made a significant adjustment in its rock format. In 1980, the station adopted one of the first full-time commercial alternative rock formats in the country. Up to that point, Pasadena-based KROQ-FM and stations in Phoenix, Seattle and New York City had attempted such formats. KROQ-FM notwithstanding, most commercial attempts at alternative rock were short- lived. KNAC began using the slogan \\"Rock and Rhythm\\" and programmed a mix of Contemporary \\"New Wave\\", Techno, Commercially-Viable Punk and fitting Classic Rock from the 1950s and 1960s. The station gathered media attention, but it was dwarfed by KROQ-FM's stellar ratings and Rick Carroll-consulted \\"Rock of the 80s\\" Alternative format. In late 1985, KNAC was acquired by Fred Sands, a Los Angeles-based realtor. On January 8, 1986, the station flipped to a \\"Hard Rock/Heavy Metal music\\" format, the first of its kind on a commercial station in the United States. Several air staff members of the heavy metal station went on to the original satellite-distributed, nationally syndicated \\"Z Rock\\" format the following September. While much of KNAC's core-base of artists were considered mainstream, the station played enough \\"cutting edge\\" artists of the day and acquired a legend that survived long beyond its demise in spring 1995. The station inspired tribute pages and a radio station on the Internet. However, revenues were not what management had hoped for. In 1995, Liberman Broadcasting, a Spanish-language broadcasting company, bought KNAC for $13 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1996 page B-44 KNAC switched to the KBUE call letters a few weeks later on March 6. The format was \\"Ranchera-Mexican style,\\" said program director Fidel Fausto. The new call letters and format did not change the fact that KBUE's signal only covered southern Los Angeles County and northwestern Orange County. Liberman would buy additional radio stations to increase the coverage of the Que Buena format. =94.3 FM= The station at 94.3 FM in San Fernando first signed on the air as KVFM in 1958, but for a long time it was KGIL-FM, a radio station playing adult standards, along with sister station to KGIL AM 1260. On August 5, 1989, it became KMGX, \\"Magic 94.3\\". The station at 94.3 FM in Garden Grove signed on in 1961 as KGGK, later to become KTBT, KORJ, KIKF (\\"KIK-FM\\", a country music station), and KMXN.\\"KIK-FM (now KMXN) 94.3 MHz, Garden Grove (Anaheim), CA When it was acquired by Liberman Broadcasting, it switched to KEBN, another call sign representing the \\"Que Buena\\" format. On November 18, 1994, the two stations on 94.3 began simulcasting the same country music format and 94.3 in San Fernando became KYKF. This lasted until October 31, 1996, after the San Fernando station was sold to Liberman and started simulcasting KBUE. On January 31, 1997, it acquired the KBUA call letters. \\"Que Buena\\" now reached most of metropolitan Los Angeles County, though reception remains difficult in some regions, such as the San Gabriel Valley and Malibu. A booster station, KBUA- FM1 in Santa Clarita, California, extends the signal's reach into the Santa Clarita Valley. On June 25, 2000, 94.3 in Garden Grove became \\"Cool 94.3\\" in Anaheim, with a \\"cool AC\\" format (somewhat of a precursor to the Jack FM format), and the call letters changed to KMXN on September 29. That call sign was likely being chosen because the format was similar to previous Orange County station KXMX known as \\"Mix 95.9\\" (now KFSH-FM). Liberman acquired KMXN in 2003, and on January 7, started simulcasting the KBUE/KBUA signal, giving \\"Que Buena\\" coverage in nearly all of Orange County. On May 15, the call letters became KEBN. KRQB On August 1, 2007, Liberman added another \\"Que Buena\\" outlet to the lineup, with the acquisition of Rhythmic Contemporary 96.1 KWIE, licensed to San Jacinto, California, from Magic Broadcasting. The call sign was immediately changed to KRQB. The addition of the new station extended Liberman's \\"Que Buena\\" brand into Riverside and San Bernardino counties. (The previous owners transferred the KWIE call letters to 93.5 in Ontario, as a simulcast of KDAY.) Other than the morning show, programming on KRQB is separate from that of the other Que Buena stations. Genre Currently, Que Buena primarily targets the \\"Mexican American\\" or \\"paisa\\" community of the greater Los Angeles area. \\"Paisa\\" is a slang term in Spanish, meaning those who are culturally Mexican or \\"paisanos\\", and thus listen to such legendary Mexican artists such as Chalino S√°nchez and Saul Viera. Other artists who gained quick popularity because of KBUE were El Narquillo, Ad√°n S√°nchez, and Lupillo Rivera, to name a few. \\"La Que Buena\\" or \\"Aqui Suena La Que Buena\\", as it is commonly referred to, also plays the genre \\"banda\\" with primarily the \\"La Banda el Recodo\\" as its focus. Other artists who have airplay are El As de la Sierra, El Chapo, Valent√≠n Elizalde, Jenni Rivera, Rogelio Mart√≠nez, El Potro de Sinaloa, El Coyote y su Banda, Los Tucanes, Los Rieleros, Los Incomparables, Los Tucanes, Los Razos, Los Originales de San Juan, and many others. There has been a recent boom within the \\"paisa\\" community with the beginning of \\"el movimiento alterado\\". Artists that fit this criteria are Larry Hernandez, Roberto Tapia, Enigma Norteno, Gerardo Ortiz, Noel Torres, Aldredito Olivas, El Komander, and others.

Typically, simulation physics is only a close approximation to actual physics, and computation is performed using discrete values. Additionally, games may intentionally deviate from actual physics for gameplay purposes; a common example is allowing the player to double jump when there is nothing to jump from, or changing the values of certain physical parameters, such as the amount of gravity present. There are several elements that form components of simulation physics including the physics engine, program code that is used to simulate Newtonian physics within the environment, and collision detection, used to solve the problem of determining when any two or more physical objects in the environment cross each other's path. Physics simulations There are two central types of physics simulations: rigid body and soft-body simulators. In a rigid body simulation objects are grouped into categories based on how they should interact and are less performance intensive. Soft-body physics involves simulating individual sections of each object such that it behaves in a more realistic way. Particle systems A common aspect of computer games that model some type of conflict is the explosion. Early computer games used the simple expedient of repeating the same explosion in each circumstance. However, in the real world an explosion can vary depending on the terrain, altitude of the explosion, and the type of solid bodies being impacted. Depending on the processing power available, the effects of the explosion can be modeled as the split and shattered components propelled by the expanding gas. This is modelled by means of a particle system simulation. A particle system model allows a variety of other physical phenomena to be simulated, including smoke, moving water, precipitation, and so forth. The individual particles within the system are modelled using the other elements of the physics simulation rules, with the limitation that the number of particles that can be simulated is restricted by the computing power of the hardware. Thus explosions may need to be modelled as a small set of large particles, rather than the more accurate huge number of fine particles. Ragdoll physics This is a procedural animation and simulation technique to display the movement of a character when killed. It treats the character's body as a series of rigid bones connected together with hinges at the joints. The simulation models what happens to the body as it collapses to the ground. More sophisticated physics models of creature movement and collision interactions require greater level of computing power and a more accurate simulation of solids, liquids, and hydrodynamics. The modelled articulated systems can then reproduce the effects of skeleton, muscles, tendons, and other physiological components. Projectiles Games such as FIFA 18 require correct projectile physics for objects such as the soccer ball. In FIFA 18, developers were required to fix code related to the drag coefficient which had been incorrect in previous games, leading to a much more realistic simulation of a real ball.

He served as governor during the Civil War and paid a heavy price for his devotion to the Union. Biography Augustus Williamson Bradford was born in Bel Air, Maryland on January 9, 1806, the son of Samuel Bradford and Jane Bond. He graduated from St. Mary's College in 1824. After graduation, he studied law under the tutelage of Otho Scott, and was admitted to the bar in 1826. He later moved to Baltimore and lived there for the rest of his life. He married Elizabeth Kell on November 10, 1835, and they had twelve children, of whom seven survived their father. In 1845, Governor Thomas Pratt appointed Bradford the Clerk of the Baltimore County Court, a post he occupied until 1851. In February 1861, Governor Thomas H. Hicks appointed Bradford one of Maryland's delegates to the Washington Peace Conference, where he made a speech supporting the Union. Following the conference, the Union Party named Bradford as its candidate for governor, opposing the Democratic candidate General Benjamin C. Howard. Bradford defeated Howard by approximately 30,000 votes and took office on January 8, 1862. During his term, he violently opposed the Federal government's interference in Maryland's elections, upheld the dignity of the State government and defied the harsh and arbitrary military occupation, and went to great lengths to keep the State in the Union. At the same time he upheld the Federal government's authority although he differed with its methods. In September 1862, he was one of the many northern governors to attend the Loyal War Governors' Conference in Altoona, Pennsylvania. During the Civil War, the Confederates invaded Maryland three times. During the last of these, Bradley T. Johnson‚Äôs raiders visited Bradford‚Äôs home in July 1864, and during his absence, burned it to the ground together with all his furniture, library, and papers. This action was partially in retaliation for Union General David Hunter‚Äôs burning of the home of Governor John Letcher of Virginia, and partially because of Bradford‚Äôs \\"uncompromising spirit and strong leanings.\\" During his four years in office, Augustus Bradford released Samuel Green (freedman) from jail on the condition he leave the state. Green was an African-American slave and minister, who was jailed in 1857 for possessing a copy of the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. He encouraged immigration into Maryland especially after the abolition of slavery, supported the appointment of a State Superintendent of Schools and School Commissioners, and the establishment of a system of education, and was instrumental in reorganizing the militia and in assisting in the movement to acquire a portion of the Gettysburg battlefield for a cemetery for the Union dead. The Constitution of 1864 which abolished slavery in the State and disenfranchised those who fought for or aided the Confederacy was only ratified by the vote of the soldiers in spite of Bradford's efforts to secure its adoption. In this respect, it was an extremely unsatisfactory document and it remained operative for only three years. Bradford objected to the federal government's policy of enlisting slaves in the Union Army at least until their owners could be compensated. At the only election held under the Constitution of 1864, that of November 8, 1864, Thomas Swann was elected as Bradford's successor. He took his oath of office on January 11, 1865, but by a provision of the Constitution, he did not actually become Governor until January 10, 1866. After his retirement from office, President Andrew Johnson appointed Bradford the Surveyor of the Port of Baltimore, which he served as until April 1869. He became a Democrat about 1872, and he was elected one of the Horace Greeley presidential electors in that year. He retired in 1869, and died in Baltimore on March 1, 1881. Funeral services were held at the Mount Vernon M.E. Church. He was buried in Greenmount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland.

Although the original title literally translates to English as Blue Flower, it is better known in English as The Apprentice, which is a better translation of the idiom used in the title. It is one of the very few Canadian films that is functionally bilingual, shot in both English and French, with the appropriate dialogue dubbed for the appropriate audience. Plot Jean-Pierre (Fiset) is a working class young Francophone with big dreams. He comes under the tutelage of his older best friend, a con-man and bank robber named Dock (Jean-Pierre Cartier), who starts teaching him the secrets of his trades, and making him an accomplice in his crimes. He is dating Dock's virginal sister, who is also active in the Quebec separatist movement. To make ends meet, Jean-Pierre works a series of menial jobs. While doing clean-up on a commercial shoot, he meets Elizabeth (Sarandon), a beautiful Anglophone model. After he is fired from the shoot for explaining the English meaning of the French name of the product she is supposed to be selling, she starts going out with him out of a sense of guilt, and they soon become lovers. However, she is a sexual libertine with no intention of being monogamous, and this soon strains their relationship. Eventually, the strain of keeping up with his two girlfriends wears on him and he decides to break up with Elizabeth. However, his clumsy attempts to break up in English (of which he does not have a fluent command) merely results in their spending the night together. He then decides to break up with Dock's sister, who realizing that he is going back to Elizabeth because of their sexual relationship, throws herself at him. Eventually, Jean-Pierre's criminal activities catch up with him, and everything ends tragically. Place in Canadian film history Fleur bleue is one of the very few films to deal with the strain between Anglophone and Francophone relationships in the city of Montreal in the late 1960s and early 1970s. At the time the film was made, Montreal was largely segregated into French speaking areas in the east, and English speaking areas in the west, with the two groups rarely interacting with each other. Jean-Pierre and Elizabeth both are from Montreal, but neither has a working command of the other's language - Jean-Pierre's English is non-fluent, and Elizabeth's French is non-existent. In addition to the strain of his relationships and his criminal career, Jean-Pierre is also dealing with a society which, while marginally under French political control, was largely under English economic control. This film was made just after department stores such as Eaton's required their Francophone clerks to converse with customers in English only, even if the customer was a Francophone as well. Jean-Pierre, rightly or wrongly, blames his economic circumstances on Anglophones, who are the only ones who can provide him with an honest, but low paying, job. His girlfriend has come to the conclusion that separation from Canada is the only solution to the problems plaguing Francophones. Dock is convinced that it doesn't matter who is in charge - people like him will suffer nevertheless, so it's everyone for themselves. Elizabeth, who is relatively well off, doesn't acknowledge the problems that exist for all the Francophones with whom she shares her city .

The relevant Biblical verses ( and ) prohibit an individual from wearing wool and linen fabrics in one garment, the blending of different species of animals, and the planting together of different kinds of seeds (collectively known as kilayim). Etymology The word is not of Hebrew origin, and its etymology is obscure. Wilhelm Gesenius's Hebrew Dictionary cites suggestions that derive it from Semitic origins, and others that suggest Coptic origin, finding neither convincing. The Septuagint translates the term as , meaning 'adulterated'. The Mishnah in tractate Kil'ayim (9:8), interprets the word as the acrostic of three words: 'combing', 'spinning', and 'twisting'. The Modern Hebrew word means 'mixture'. Interpretation Early writers, like Maimonides, state that the prohibition was a case of the general law () against imitating Canaanite customs. Maimonides wrote: \\"the heathen priests adorned themselves with garments containing vegetable and animal materials, while they held in their hand a seal of mineral. This you will find written in their books\\".Maimonides, Moreh, 3:37 Classical Kabbalah regarded such combinations as a defiance of God, because according to them, God had given each species individuality. Because the priest's girdle, and the tzitzit which every man wore, are preferably made from shatnez, the prohibition was a way of setting aside this fiber blend only for holy purposes. According to modern biblical scholars (and Josephus), the rules against these mixtures are survivals of the clothing of the ancient Jewish temple and that these mixtures were considered to be holy and/or were forfeited to a sanctuary.Peake's commentary on the BibleJosephus. Antiquities 4:8:11. It may also be observed that linen is a product of a riverine agricultural economy, such as that of the Nile Valley, while wool is a product of a desert, pastoral economy, such as that of the Hebrew tribes. Mixing the two together symbolically mixes Egypt and the Hebrews. It also violates a more general aversion to the mixing of categories found in the Leviticus holiness code, as suggested by anthropologists such as Mary Douglas. Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook suggested that shearing wool from sheep is, at some level, \\"a form of theft, the oppression of the weak at the hands of the strong.\\" Since utilizing the flax plant and sheep are not ‚Äì in absolute terms ‚Äì morally equivalent, the Torah sought to distinguish between them, to instill a sensitivity towards animal welfare. Limitations of the law =Definition of shatnez material= In the Torah, one is prohibited from wearing shatnez only after it has been carded, woven, and twisted, but the rabbis prohibit it if it has been subjected to any one of these operations.Talmud, Tractate Niddah 61b Hence felt made with a mixture of wool compressed together with linen is forbidden.Tractate Kilaim ix. 9 Silk, which resembled wool, and hemp, which resembled linen, were formerly forbidden for appearance's sake,talmud, Tractate Kilaim ix. 3 but were later permitted in combination with either wool or linen, because we now know how to distinguish them. Hempen thread was thus manufactured and permitted for use in sewing woolen clothing. Only sheep's wool is considered as wool, the finest being that of lambs and rams;cf. 2 Kings 3:4 excluded is camels' hair, the fur of hares, and the wool of goats. If any of the excluded wools is mixed with sheep's wool, or spun with it into thread, the character of the material is determined by the proportion of each. If the greater part of it is sheep's wool, it is reckoned as wool; if the contrary, it is not wool and may be mixed again with linen.Talmud, Tractate Kilaim ix. 1 Permitted applications =Kehuna clothing= Rabbinic Judaism maintains that shatnez was permitted in the case of the avnet (Kohen's girdle), in which fine white linen was interwoven with purple, blue, and scarlet material. According to the rabbis, the purple, blue, and scarlet were made from wool and interwoven with the fine linen. Karaite Judaism maintains that the purple, blue, and scarlet materials must also have been made of linen, since the Torah prohibits wearing garments made from combinations of wool and linen. The Torah does not state from what materials the purple, blue, and scarlet threads were made.Exodus 28:6 The phrase regarding the kohanim sons of Zadok, \\"they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat\\"Ezekiel 44:18 is interpreted in the Talmud to mean \\"they shall not gird themselves around the bent of the body, where sweat effuses most\\".Talmud, Tractate Zebachim. 18b Rabbi Judah haNasi was of the opinion that the girdle of the ordinary priest was of shatnez, but Rebbi Eleazar says it was of fine linen. The Talmud states that the high priest wore a linen girdle on Yom Kippur and a girdle of shatnez on all other days.Talmud, Tractate Yoma 12b =Everyday tzitzit= Torah law forbids kil'ayim (shatnez) - \\"intertying\\" wool and linen together, with the two exceptions being garments of kohanim and tzitit. Concerning tzitzit, chazal permit using wool and linen strings in tandem only when genuine tchelet or tekhelet is available, whereas kabbalist sources take it a step further by encouraging its practice. =Contact with shatnez= The Talmud argues that a woolen garment may be worn over a linen garment, or vice versa, but they may not be knotted or sewed together. Shatnez is prohibited only when worn as an ordinary garment, for the protection or benefit of the body,Sifra, Deuteronomy 232 or for its warmth,Talmud, Tractate Betzah 15a but not if carried on the back as a burden or as merchandise. Felt soles with heels are also permitted, because they are stiff and do not warm the feet. In later times, rabbis liberalised the law, and, for example, permitted shatnez to be used in stiff hats.Sefer ha-Chinuch, section \\"Ki Tetze\\", No. 571 Cushions, pillows, and tapestry with which the bare body does not touch do not come under the prohibition,Talmud, Tractate Kilaim. ix. 2 and lying on shatnez is technically permitted. However, classical rabbinical commentators feared that some part of a shatnez fabric might fold over and touch part of the body; hence, they went to the extreme of declaring that even if only the lowest of 10 couch-covers is of shatnez, one may not lie on them.Talmud, Tractate Yoma 69a Observance and enforcement of the shatnez law Light microscopy is performed on fabric pulled from a garment. The fabric is placed between two glass slides. Many people bring clothing to special experts who are employed to detect the presence of shatnez.Ha-Karmel, i., No. 40 A linen admixture can be detected during the process of dyeing cloth, as wool absorbs dye more readily than linen does. Wool can be distinguished from linen by four tests‚Äîfeeling, burning, tasting, and smelling; linen burns in a flame, while wool singes and creates an unpleasant odor. Linen thread has a gummy consistency if chewed, due to its pectin content; a quality only found in bast fibers. Observance of the laws concerning shatnez became neglected in the 16th century, and the Council of Four Lands found it necessary to enact (1607) a takkanah (\\"decree\\") against shatnez, especially warning women not to sew woolen trails to linen dresses, nor to sew a velvet strip in front of the dress, as velvet had a linen back.Gratz, Gesch. vii. 36, Hebrew ed., Warsaw, 1899 Observant Jews in current times also follow the laws of shatnez, and newly purchased garments are checked by experts to ensure no forbidden admixtures are used. In addition to the above-mentioned methods, modern shatnez experts employ the use of microscopy to determine textile content. In most cases, garments that do not comply can be made compliant by removing the sections containing linen. Some companies label compliant products with \\"shatnez-free\\" tags. Karaites and shatnez Karaite Jews, who do not recognize the Talmud, forbid the wearing of garments made with linen and wool (and fibers from any plant and/or any animal) at once under any circumstances. It is forbidden even for one to touch the other. Unlike Talmudic Jews, Karaites do not permit making the tzitzit (fringes or tassels) out of shatnez.http://www.karaites.org.uk/sisit.shtml References Bibliography * Maimonides.

Living mulches grow for a long time with the main crops, whereas cover crops are incorporated into the soil or killed with herbicides. Other benefits of mulches are slowing the growth of weeds, and protecting soil from water and wind erosion. Some living mulches were found to increase populations of the natural enemies of crop pests.Hartwig N.L., H.. Ammon 2002 Cover crops and living mulches Weed Sci. 50: 688-699 Legumes used as living mulches also provide nitrogen fixation, reducing the need for fertilizer.  Benefits  When cover crops are turned over into the soil, they contribute nutrients to the main crop so that less chemical fertilizer is required.Brophy L. S., G. H. Heichel and M.P. Russelle. 1987 Nitrogen transfer from forage legumes to grass in a systematic planting design Crop Sci 27: 753-758 The amount of the contribution depends on the biomass, which varies over time and depends on rainfall and other factors. The greater the biomass, the greater the nutrient turnover of land. Legume cover crops turn over nitrogen fixed from the atmosphere. Reports indicate that legumes in general have higher foliar nitrogen contents, from 20 to 45 mg g-1.Lehmann J, J.P. da Silva, Jr. L. Trujillo, K. Uguen 2000 Legume cover crops and nutrient cycling in tropical fruit tree production Acta Horticulturae 531: 35-72. Bare soil resulting from intensive tillage can lead to soil erosion, nutrient losses, and offsite movement of pesticides. In addition, weeds can germinate and grow without competition. Living mulches can reduce water runoff and erosion, and protect waterways from pollution. Living mulches have also been shown to increase the population of organisms which are natural enemies of some crop pests. Living mulches control weeds in two ways. When they are seeded before weed establishment, they suppress weeds by competition.Hartwig N.L 1977 Nutsedge control in no-tillage corn with and without a crownvetch cover crop. Proc. Northeast. Weed Sci. Society 31: 20-33 In some situations, the allelopathic properties of living mulches can be used to control weeds. For example, the allelopathic properties of winter rye (Secale cereale), ryegrasses (Lolium spp), and subterrain clover (Trifolium subterraneum) can be used to control weeds in sweet corn (Zea mays var \\"rugosa\\") and snap beans (Phaseolus vulgaris).De Gregorio R. E. and R.A. Ashley. 1986. Screening living mulches/ cover crops for no-till snap beans. Proc. Northeast. Weed Sci. Soc. 40:87-91 Populations of ground-dwelling predators were greater in a corn and soybean rotation with alfalfa and kura clover living mulches than without a living mulch.Prafiska J. R, N. P Schmidt, and K.A Kohler, 2006 Effects of living mulches on predator abundance and sentinel prey in a corn-soybean-forage rotation Env. Entomology 35: 1423-1431 This situation was due in part to a change in the composition of vegetation in the agricultural system.Andow 1991. Vegetational diversity and arthropod population response. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 36: 561- 586.  Drawbacks  Unfortunately, living mulches compete for nutrients and water with the main crop,Echtenkamp, G. W, and R. Moomaw 1989 No-till corn production in a living mulch system Weed technology 3: 261-266 and this can reduce yields. For example, Elkins et al. (1983) examined the use of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis), and orchargrass (Dactylis glomerata) as living mulches. They found that herbicides killed 50% to 70% of the mulches but corn yield was reduced 5% to 10% at the end of the harvest.Elkins, D., D. Frederking, R. Marashi, and B. McVay. 1983. Living mulch for no-till corn and soybeans. J. soil Water Conserv, 38: 431-433 Although leguminous cover crops have large biomass production and turnover, they are not likely to increase soil organic matter.Barber, R.G., and F. Navarro 1994. The rehabitation of degraded soils in eastern Bolivia by subsoiling and the incorporation of cover crops. Land Degr. Rehab. 5:247-259 This is because legumes used as living mulches have greater N contents and a low C to N ratio. So when legume residue decomposes, soil microbes have sufficient N available to enhance their breakdown of organic materials in the soil. Types In the tropics, it is common to seed tree crops with living mulches such as legume covers in oil palm plantations,Broughton W.J., 1977. Effects of various covers on soil fertility under Hevea brasiliensis and on growth of the tree. Agro-Ecosys. 3:147-170 coconutAldaba F.R., 1995. Coconut production in the Philippines: problems and prospects. Plantatios, Recherche, Developpement Sept-Oct:15-18 and rubber (Watson 1989). In Mexico, legumes used traditionally as living mulches were tested as nematode and weed suppressors.Caamal-Maldonado J.A.,Jimenez J.J., Torres A., Anaya A. 2001. The use of allelopathic legume cover and mulch species for weed control in cropping systems. Agron J. 93:27-36 The mulches included velvetbean (Mucuna pruriens) jackbean (Canavalia ensiformis), jumbiebean (Leucaena leucocephala) and wild tamarindo (Lysiloma latisiliquum). Aqueous extract of Velvetbean reduced the gall index of Meloidogyne incognita in the roots of tomato, but suppressed tomato rooting as well. In addition, Velvetbean suppressed the radical growth of the local weeds Alegria (Amaranthus hypochondriacus) by 66% and Barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli) by 26.5%. Nicholson and Wien (1983) suggested the use of short turfgrasses and clovers as living mulches to improve the resistance soil compaction. These authors established Smooth Meadow-grass (Poa pratensis) and white clover (Trifolium repens) as living mulches since they did not cause reduction of yield corn (the accompanying main crop).Nicholson, A.G., and H.C. Wein. 1983. Screening of turfgrasses and clovers for use as living mulches in sweet corn and cabbage . J. Am Soc. Hort. Sci. 108:1071-1076 In one study, chewing fescue or red fescue (Festuca rubra) and ladino clover (Trifolium repens) were effective living mulches for controlling weed growth. Unfortunately, these cover crops also competed with corn for water which was particularly problematic during a dry period. The possibility of using ladino clover (Trifolium repens) as a potential living mulch was also mentioned; however, this clover was difficult to kill with herbicides in winter.  Management  Because they compete with the main crop, living mulches may eventually need to be mechanically or chemically killed.Brandsaeter, L. J. Netland, and R. Meadow 1998 Yields, weeds, pests and soil nitrogen in a white cabbage living mulch system, in Biol. Agric. Hortic. 16: 291-309Tharp, B. e., and J. J. Dells. 2001 Delayed burndown in no-tillage glyphosate-resistant corn (Zea mays) planted into soybean (Glycine max) residue and a wheat (Triticum aestivum) cover crop. Weed Technol. 15: 467-473 It is important to judiciously select the appropriate herbicide rate for burning down a living mulch. In 1989, Echtenkamp and Moomaw found that herbicide rates were inadequate to suppress all the living mulches. Therefore, the mulches competed with the main crop for resources. In some cases, the clover could not be killed at the first herbicide application, so a second application was needed. For another treatment, rates that were so high that they caused the cover crop to be killed too rapidly, so that broadleaf weeds invaded the corn. This study suggested that the timing and dosage of herbicide should be carefully considered. Living mulches were tested in a no-till corn- production systems with two methods for establishing grass and legume living mulches (grass and legume) between corn rows. In 1985, there was no difference between drilling and broadcasting seeds by hand in that study. However in 1986, drilling resulted in higher populations (97 plants m-2) than broadcasting (64 plants m-2), likely because of precipitation levels. Precipitation should be considered because farmers have no control over it. Beard (1973) recommended chewing fescue (red fescue) (Festuca rubra var \\"commutata\\" var \\"shadow FESRU\\") as a good living mulch because it adapts to the shady conditions under corn and soybean.Beard, J. 1973 Turfgrass: Science and Culture Prentice-Hall Inc. Englewood Cliffs, NJ This grass is also well adapted to dry and poor soils.  Plant nutrition  Legume cover crops have important positive effects on the nutrient cycling of tree crops. Leguminous living mulches work in three ways: * Fixing the atmospheric N2 that is important for the main crop, * Recycling soil nutrients, and * Enhancing soil nutrient availability for the main crop. Lehmann et al. (2000) measured the above ground biomass accumulation of Pueraria phaseoloides, which is a living mulch used in tropical tree crops. They found that Pueraria accumulated 8.8 metric ton of dm (dry matter) ha-1 as compared with 4.4 t dm ha‚àí1 for Theobroma grandiflorum, and 1.4 t dm ha-1 for Bactris gasipaes. These latter two species are native cultivated species from the Amazon.  Control of erosion  Vegetative cover as living mulches protect soil against wind and water erosion. Plants should form a mantle or thick mulch that protect soil from detachment. Living mulches intercept raindrops and reduce runoff. The protection that such vegetation provides against wind is influenced mainly by the amount of biomass that covers the ground (differs with each spp), plant geometry and row orientation.Trohen F and J.A. Hobbs 1991 Soil and water conservation 1991 4:83-84 and 5: 108-109 Prentice Hall Inc. Englewood Cliffs, NJ In one experiment, water runoff and soil loss on a 14% slope was compared for rototilled (RT), no-till with corn stover mulch (NTCMS), no-till in CSM+ birdsfoot trefoil living mulch (NT-BFT) and no till in CSM and crownvetch living mulch (NT-CV). The results indicated that the water runoff was 6,350 L ha-1 for NT-BFT, 6,350 L ha-1 NO-CSM, 5,925 L ha-1 for NT-CV, and 145,000 L ha-1 for RT. The soil loss for the RT was 14.22 t ha-1 while with the other treatments it was less than 0.5 tons ha-1. The least soil loss was obtained with NT-CV 0.02 tons ha-1.Hall J, L. Hartwing, and L. Hoffman 1984 Cyanazine losses in runoff from no-tillage corn in \\"living mulch\\" and dead mulches vs. unmulched conventional tillage. J. Envoron. Qual 13: 105-110 The reduction of water runoff and erosion is one of the greatest advantages of having a cover crop. Soil can be easily eroded with no vegetative ground cover or plant residue. Ideally soil erosion should be less than 4 to 5 tons/ha/year.Pimentel D., C. Harvey, P. Resosudarmo et al., 1995 Environmental and economic costs of soil erosion and conservation benefits.

These utilities often operate as legal monopolies, which means that they do not compete in a marketplace but are instead regulated by commissions to ensure fair pricing. =Countries= * Costa Rica: Costa Rica Public Utilities Commission *Dominican Republic: c Utilities Commission * Bahamas: Bahamas Public Utilities Commission * Belize: Belize Public Utilities Commission * Chile: Superintendencia de Servicios Sanitarios de Chile * France: Commission de R√©gulation de l'Energie * Ghana: Public Utility Regulation Council of Ghana (PURC) * Sri Lanka: Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka =United States= Elected by district * New Mexico Public Regulation Commission Elected at-large * Alabama Public Service Commission * Arizona Corporation Commission * Georgia Public Service Commission * Louisiana Public Service Commission * Mississippi Public Service Commission * Montana Public Service Commission * Nebraska Public Service Commission * North Dakota Public Service Commission * Oklahoma Corporation Commission * South Dakota Public Utilities Commission Legislative appointment * South Carolina Public Service Commission * Virginia State Corporation Commission Appointed by the governor * Regulatory Commission of Alaska * Arkansas Public Service Commission * California Public Utilities Commission * Colorado Public Utilities Commission * Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control * Delaware Public Service Commission * District of Columbia Public Service Commission * Florida Public Service Commission * Hawaii Public Utilities Commission * Idaho Public Utilities Commission * Illinois Commerce Commission * Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission * Iowa Utilities Board * Kansas Corporation Commission * Kentucky Public Service Commission * Maine Public Utilities Commission * Maryland Public Service Commission * Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities * Michigan Public Service Commission * Minnesota Public Utilities Commission * Missouri Public Service Commission * Nevada Public Utilities Commission * New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission * New Jersey Board of Public Utilities * New York Public Service Commission * North Carolina Utilities Commission * Public Utilities Commission of Ohio * Oregon Public Utility Commission * Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission * Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission * Tennessee Public Service Commission (1897-1996); Tennessee Regulatory Authority (since 1996) * Texas Public Utility Commission * Utah Public Service Commission * Vermont Public Service Board * Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission (http://wmatc.gov) * Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission * West Virginia Public Service Commission * Wisconsin Public Service Commission * Wyoming Public Service Commission The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners is the national association representing the interests of the public utilities commissions in all 50 states.

A \\"simple cottage\\" designed circa 1876 by George Devey. An early example of Tudorbethan influence Tudor Revival architecture (also known as mock Tudor in the UK) first manifested itself in domestic architecture in the United Kingdom in the latter half of the 19th century. Based on revival of aspects that were perceived as Tudor architecture, in reality it usually took the style of English vernacular architecture of the Middle Ages that had survived into the Tudor period. The style later became an influence elsewhere, especially the British colonies. For example, in New Zealand, the architect Francis Petre adapted the style for the local climate. In Singapore, then a British colony, architects such as R. A. J. Bidwell pioneered what became known as the Black and White House. The earliest examples of the style originate with the works of such eminent architects as Norman Shaw and George Devey, in what at the time was thought Neo-Tudor design. Tudorbethan is a subset of Tudor Revival architecture that eliminated some of the more complex aspects of Jacobethan in favor of more domestic styles of \\"Merrie England\\", which were cosier and quaint. It was associated with the Arts and Crafts movement. Half-timbering, Gothic Revival tracery and Jacobean carved porch brackets combine in the Tudor Revival Beaney Institute, Canterbury (1899) Identifying Tudor Revival Today, the term 'Tudor architecture' usually refers to buildings constructed during the reigns of the first four Tudor monarchs, between about 1485 and 1560, perhaps best exemplified by the oldest parts of Hampton Court Palace. The historian Malcolm Airs, in his study The Tudor and Jacobean Country House: A Building History, considers the replacement of the private castle by the country house as \\"the seat of power and the centre of hospitality\\" to be \\"one of the great achievements of the Tudor age\\". Subsequent changes in court fashion saw the emergence of Elizabethan architecture among the elite, who built what are now called prodigy houses in a distinctive version of Renaissance architecture.Summerson, Chapter 1 to 4 cover this period; this brief summary is rather over-simplified. Elizabeth I herself built almost nothing, her father having left over 50 palaces and houses.Summerson, 23 Outside court circles styles were much more slow-moving, and essentially \\"Tudor\\" buildings continued to be built, eventually merging into a general English vernacular style. When the style was revived, the emphasis was typically on the simple, rustic, and the less impressive aspects of Tudor architecture, imitating in this way medieval houses and rural cottages. Although the style follows these more modest characteristics, items such as steeply pitched-roofs, half- timbering often infilled with herringbone brickwork, tall mullioned windows, high chimneys, jettied (overhanging) first floors above pillared porches, dormer windows supported by consoles, and even at times thatched roofs, gave Tudor Revival its more striking effects. Beginnings Vine Cottage, Blaise Hamlet, John Nash, 1812 As the last phase of English Gothic architecture, and the phase of the style that had the most secular survivals in 17th and 18th- century England, Tudor elements often appear in \\"Gothic Survival\\" buildings, notably those commissioned by Oxbridge colleges, both out of conservatism and a desire to fit in with older buildings around them.Summerson, 163-164 Christopher Wren's additions to the genuinely Tudor Tom Quad at Christ Church, Oxford, including Tom Tower (1681‚Äì82), are among the best-known examples.Summerson, 235-236 Dalmeny House near Edinburgh, 1817, by William Wilkins Tudor elements also often occur in the earliest stirrings of Gothic Revival architecture in the 18th and early 19th century,Summerson, 366-376, 447-452 for example in the group of nine cottages at Blaise Hamlet, built around 1810‚Äì1811 to designs by John Nash. Solidly built of stone, quite large, and intended for the retired employees of the Bristol banker who built them, they are remarkably forward-looking in their selective appropriation of Tudor elements such as fancy twisted brick chimmney stacks to make picturesque and comfortable middle-class homes in a version of English vernacular architecture. Several have thatched roofs, some at two levels in a completely unnecessary but very picturesque way. Nash published an illustrated book on the group; this was a formula with a future.Aslet and Power, 151-152; Summerson, 451 In contrast, Dalmeny House near Edinburgh, built in 1817 for Archibald Primrose, 4th Earl of Rosebery, is a large stately home in a revival of the early Tudor palace style, drawing in particular from East Barsham Manor in Norfolk, built c. 1520. At this time the style was known as \\"Old English\\", and considered especially appropriate for vicarages and rectories, partly because they were usually next to the church, which was likely to be Gothic. Tudor style was \\"almost infinitely adaptable, particularly to low, spreading houses\\",Aslet and Power, 152-153 (153 quoted), 158-159 and because the larger windows patrons wanted were easier to work into the style than into a \\"pointed\\" Gothic. At this stage it was essentially a style for the country rather than houses in towns.Aslet and Power, 162 After about 1850 \\"Old English\\" came to mean a rather different style based on vernacular architecture, although some Tudor features such as tall brick chimneys often remained.Aslet and Power, 162-163 Evolution The Tudor Revival style was a reaction to the ornate Victorian Gothic Revival of the second half of the 19th century. Rejecting mass production that was introduced by industry at that time, the Arts and Crafts movement, closely related to Tudorbethan, drew on simple design inherent in aspects of its more ancient styles, Tudor, Elizabethan and Jacobean.Dean, p250-251 The Tudor style made one of its first appearances in Britain in the late 1860s at Cragside, a hilltop mansion of eclectic architectural styles that incorporated certain Tudor features; Cragside was designed by the architect Norman Shaw. Shaw sketched out the whole design for the \\"future fairy palace\\" in a single afternoon, while his client Lord Armstrong and his guests were out on a shooting party. Pevsner noted its derivation from \\"the Tudor style, both in its stone and its black- and-white versions\\". The half-timbering has been criticised as unfaithful to the vernacular tradition of the North-East of England, but the architectural historian Mark Girouard explained Shaw's picturesque motivation; desiring it for \\"romantic effect, he reached out for it like an artist reaching out for a tube of colour\\". Leyswood, after the architect's drawings. At approximately the same time, Shaw also designed Leyswood near Withyham in East Sussex, which was a large mansion around a courtyard, complete with mock battlements, towers, half-timbered upper facades and tall chimneys ‚Äì all features quite readily associated with Tudor architecture; in Shaw's hands, this less fantastical style achieved immediate maturity.Aslet and Power, 162-164 Confusingly, it was then promptly named \\"Queen Anne style\\", when in reality it combined a revival of Elizabethan and Jacobean design details including mullioned and oriel windows. The style later began to incorporate the classic pre-Georgian features that are generally understood to represent \\"Queen Anne\\" in Britain. The term \\"Queen Anne\\" for this style of architecture is now only commonly used in the USA. While in Britain the style remained closer to its Tudor roots, in the USA it evolved into a form of architecture not instantly recognisable as that constructed in either the Tudor or Queen Anne period. The style was also utilised for public buildings; an early example was the Great Hall and Library at Lincoln's Inn in central London, built in the late 1840s. The architect was Philip Hardwick, better known for the classical Euston Arch. The historian Michael Hall considers the hall and library among \\"the finest Tudor Revival buildings (of) the nineteenth century. =Tudorbethan= Tudorbethan represents a subset of Tudor Revival architecture; the word is modelled on John Betjeman's 1933 coinage of the \\"Jacobethan\\" style, which he used to describe the grand mixed revival style of circa 1835‚Äì1885 that had been called things like \\"Free English Renaissance\\". This was generally modelled on the grand prodigy houses built by the courtiers of Elizabeth I and James VI. \\"Tudorbethan\\" took it a step further, eliminated the hexagonal or many-faceted towers and mock battlements of Jacobethan, and applied the more domestic styles of \\"Merrie England\\", which were cosier and quaint. It was associated with the Arts and Crafts movement. Outside North America, Tudorbethan is also used synonymously with Tudor Revival and mock Tudor. Half-timbering Built circa 1870 two semi-detached cottages at Mentmore appear as one Tudor-style house From the 1880s onwards, Tudor Revival concentrated more on the simple but quaintly picturesque Elizabethan cottage, rather than the brick and battlemented splendours of Hampton Court or Compton Wynyates. Large and small houses alike with half-timbering in their upper storeys and gables were completed with tall ornamental chimneys, in what was originally a simple cottage style. It was here that the influences of the arts and crafts movement became apparent. However, Tudor Revival cannot really be likened to the timber-framed structures of the originals, in which the frame supported the whole weight of the house. Their modern counterparts consist of bricks or blocks of various materials, stucco, or even simple studwall framing, with a lookalike \\"frame\\" of thin boards added on the outside to mimic the earlier functional and structural weight-bearing heavy timbers. An example of this is the \\"simple cottage\\" style of Ascott House in Buckinghamshire. This was designed by Devey for the Rothschild family, who were among the earliest patrons and promoters of this style.Robinson, P8 Simon Jenkins suggests that Ascott, \\"a half-timbered, heavily gabled, overgrown cottage, proves the appeal of Tudor to every era and condition of England\\". Devey's work at St Alban's Court and elsewhere incorporated other features of the Tudor Revival style such as \\"hung tiles and patterned brickwork\\". At St Alban's he also made use of rag-stone footings to create the impression of a Tudor mansion built \\"on the stone of medieval foundations\\". Some more enlightened landlords at this time became more aware of the needs for proper sanitation and housing for their employees, and some estate villages were rebuilt to resemble what was thought to be an idyllic Elizabethan village, often grouped around a village green and pond; Mentmore in Buckinghamshire is an example of this, Pevsner noting the \\"Arts-and-Crafts (and) cottage orn√©\\" building styles. The Tudor Revival, though, now concentrated on the picturesque. This combined with a desire for \\"naturalness\\", an intention to make buildings appear as if they had developed organically over the centuries, which the architectural historian James Stevens Curl considered \\"one of the most significant of English contributions to architecture\\". An example is the \\"Tudor Village\\" constructed by Frank Loughborough Pearson for his client William Waldorf Astor at Hever Castle in Kent. Pearson went to considerable lengths to source genuine Elizabethan building materials for the cottages, including stone, tiles and bricks, leading Astor to comment; \\"I could not believe they had been built a few short months ago, they looked so old and crooked\\". A very well-known example of the idealised half-timbered style is Liberty & Co. department store in London, which was built in the style of a vast half-timbered Tudor mansion. The store specialised, among other goods, in fabrics and furnishings by the leading designers of the Arts and Crafts movement. 20th-century Tudor Revival Lutyens' houses, here quite conventional in 1899, were to evolve still further from their Tudor roots In the early part of the century, one of the exponents who developed the style further was Edwin Lutyens (1864‚Äì1944). At The Deanery in Berkshire, 1899, (right), where the client was the editor of the influential magazine Country Life, details like the openwork brick balustrade, the many-paned oriel window and facetted staircase tower, the shadowed windows under the eaves, or the prominent clustered chimneys were conventional Tudor Revival borrowings, some of which Lutyens was to remake in his own style, that already predominates in the dark recessed entryway, the confident massing, and his signature semi-circular terrace steps. This is Tudorbethan at its best, free in ground plan, stripped of cuteness, yet warmly vernacular in effect, familiar though new, eminently liveable. The Deanery was another example of the \\"naturalistic\\" approach; an anonymous reviewer for Country Life in 1903 wrote; \\"So naturally has the house been planned that it seems to have grown out of the landscape rather than to have been fitted into it\\". An example of Tudorbethan architecture was that seen at Greaves Hall, which was built in 1900 as a mansion house for the Scarisbrick family. Many of the features of the original building could still be seen until it was demolished in 2009. Later came Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott (1865‚Äì1945) and Blair Imrie who made their names as Tudor style architects. Lutyens though took the style away from what is generally understood as Tudor Revival creating a further highly personalised style of his own. His buildings coupled with their often accompanying gardens by Gertrude Jekyll, while in a style thought of as \\"olde world\\" would not be recognisable to inhabitants of the 16th century. The Bakken Museum in Minneapolis, Minnesota, built 1928‚Äì1930 Following the First World War many London outer suburbs had developments of houses in the style, all reflecting the taste for nostalgia for rural values. In the first half of the 20th century, increasingly minimal \\"Tudor\\" references for \\"instant\\" atmosphere in speculative construction cheapened the style. The writer Olive Cook had this debased approach firmly in her sights when she attacked, \\"the rash of semi-detached villas, bedizened with Tudor gables, mock half-timber work, rough cast and bay windows of every shape which disfigures the outskirts of all our towns\\". It was also copied in many areas of the world, including the United States and Canada. New York City suburbs such as Westchester County, New York and Englewood and Teaneck, New Jersey feature particularly dense concentrations of Tudor Revival construction from this period. There were also public houses, some designed in a style called, 'Brewer's Tudor'. The cheapened style was finally epitomized in John Betjeman's angry 1937 poem Slough, where \\"bald young clerks\\" gather: Tudor Revival features on the 1899 Saitta House, a Queen Anne Victorian, located in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn, New York‚ÄúSaitta House ‚Äì Report Part 1 ‚Äù,DykerHeightsCivicAssociation.com The late 20th century has seen a change in the faithfulness of emulation of the style, since in a modern development it is common to have only a few basic floor plans for buildings, these combined with variations in interior surface treatment and in the exterior in rooflines and setbacks to provide a visual variety to the street view. Owing to the smaller lots employed in modern developments (especially in the Western US), Tudor Revival may be placed directly next to an unrelated style such as French or Italian Provincial, resulting in an eclectic mix. The style has also been deployed for commercial developments; the architectural historian Anthony Quiney describes the Broadway Centre in the London borough of Ealing, \\"dressed out with brick and tile, arches, gables and small window panes, all to put a smile on a friendly face - the mask of tradition\\". Interiors The interiors of the Tudor style building have evolved considerably along with the style, often becoming truer to the replicated era than were the first examples of the revival style, where the style \\"rarely went far indoors\\".Aslet and Power, 248 At Ascott House, Devey's great masterpiece constructed throughout the last twenty years of the 19th century, the interior was remodeled just thirty years later. The Tudor Revival style was considered passe and was replaced by the fashionable Curzon Street Baroque sweeping away the inglenook fireplaces and heavy oak panelling.Robinson, p9 the large airy rooms are in fact more redolent of the 18th century than the 16th. Cragside is slightly more true to its theme, although the rooms are very large, some contain Tudor style panelling, and the dining room contains are monumental inglenook, but this is more in the style of Italian renaissance meets Camelot than Tudor. While in the cottages at Mentmore the interiors are no different from those of any lower middle-class Victorian small household. An example of a Tudor Revival house where the exterior and interior were treated with equal care is Old Place, Lindfield, West Sussex. The property, comprising an original house of c.1590, was developed by the stained glass designer Charles Eamer Kempe from the 1870s. The architect George Frederick Bodley described the rooms as \\"a series of pictures\\" and an article in Country Life asking whether \\"anything could be more English in character than Old Place\\", was written when much of the house was barely 10 years old. In some of the larger Tudor style houses the Tudor great hall would be suggested by the reception hall, often furnished as a sitting or dining room. Large wooden staircases of several flights were often prominently positioned, based on Jacobean prototypes. It is this mingling of styles that has led to the term Jacobethan which resulted in houses such as Harlaxton Manor which bore little if any resemblance to a building from either period. Hall notes the influence of Burghley House and Wollaton Hall, \\"fused with ideas drawn from Continental architecture of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\\". More often it is in the Tudor style houses of the very early 20th century that a greater devotion to the Tudor period is found, with appropriate interior layout, albeit coupled with modern-day comforts. This can be seen in older upscale neighborhoods where the lots are sufficiently large to allow the house to have an individual presence, despite variations in the style of neighboring houses. Whether of older or recent origin, the appearance of solid beams and half timbered exterior walls is only superficial. Artificially aged and blackened beams are constructed from light wood, bear no loads, and are attached to ceilings and walls purely for decoration, while artificial flames leap from wrought iron fire-dogs in an inglenook often a third of the size of the room in which they are situated. Occasionally, owners sought to replicate more closely the conditions of Tudor living; an example were the Moynes at Baliffscourt in West Sussex, a house which Clive Aslet describes as \\"the most extreme - and most successful - of all Tudor taste country houses\\". Lord Moyne's wife, Evelyn, a society hostess, employed the amateur architect Amyas Philips to create a house inspired by the medieval Baliffscourt Chapel which stood on the site. The cloister-like design required visitors to leave the house and access their bedrooms via external staircases. Chips Channon, the diarist and politician described the bedrooms themselves as \\"decorated to resemble the cell of a rather 'pansy' monk\\". The novelist E. F. Benson satirised the style in his book Queen Lucia; \\"the famous smoking- parlour, with rushes on the floor, a dresser ranged with pewter tankards, and leaded lattice-windows of glass so antique that it was practically impossible to see out of them...sconces on the walls held dim iron lamps, so that only those of the most acute vision were able to read\\". 21st-century Tudor Revival Mock Tudor house in Greenock, Scotland Many British builders include variations on Tudorbethan in the range of styles they draw on, and the style tends to be associated with pastiche. Architects are rarely requested to work in the style, and though current postmodern architecture includes a much wider range of styles than the modernism associated with the mid-20th century, few architects are known for buildings which could be called \\"Tudorbethan\\". In modern structures, usually on estates of private houses, a half-timbered appearance is obtained by applied decorative features over the \\"real\\" structure, typically wood stud framing or concrete block masonry. A combination of boards and stucco is applied to obtain the desired appearance, here seen in the upper image to the right. To minimise maintenance, the \\"boards\\" are now commonly made of uPVC faux wood, plastic or fibre reinforced cement siding with a dark brown or wood effect finish. In the United States, the style is often further modified by painting the timbers colors such as blue or green. The Tudor Revival style was most popular for new American homes in the 1970s and '80s. Today, it is rarely considered for residential construction in that country as Italian, Mediterranean, and French villa style homes have superseded them in popularity.

Discovery In 1985 the fossil of Iberomesornis was discovered by Armando D√≠az Romeral in the Early Cretaceous Calizas de La Hu√©rguina Formation at Las Hoyas, Cuenca Province, east central Spain, which dates to the late Barremian, roughly 125 million years ago. The find was first reported in 1988. In 1992 the type species Iberomesornis romerali was named and described by Jos√© Luis Sanz and Jos√© Fernando Bonaparte. The generic name is derived from Iberia and Greek ŒºŒ≠œÉŒøœÇ, mesos, \\"middle\\", en ·ΩÑœÅŒΩŒπœÇ, ornis, \\"bird\\", in reference to the intermediate status between the most basal and the modern birds. The specific name honours Romeral. The holotype specimen, LH-22, part of the Las Hoyas Collection, consists of a compressed articulated partial skeleton of an adult individual lacking the skull, the anterior neck and most of the hands. A second specimen, LH-8200, was referred to a Iberomesornis sp. in 1994, consisting of the left foot of an individual similar in size to the holotype. After further preparation of the fossil, the species was redescribed by Paul Sereno in 2000. Biology and ecology Restoration Iberomesornis was quite small, no bigger than a large modern sparrow. On the assumption it had relatively short wings, the wingspan was about twenty centimetres; its weight has been estimated at fifteen to twenty grammes. It bore a single claw on each wing. The preserved axial column length is eighty-seven millimetres. Its ribcage was not strengthened by ossified uncinate processes but cartilaginous processes were likely present. The Las Hoyas Unit 3 site was once a forest surrounding a lake; the climate was warm with a distinct dry season. Since the skull is not known, the diet of Iberomesornis remains a subject of guesswork. It perhaps hunted insects and other small animals, plucking them out of the air or from the ground. It may have preferred to live near lakes, catching insects from the water's surface. When resting, it used its strong, clawed feet to perch on branches; the toes are long with curved claws and a low and long hallux improved the grasping ability. Phylogeny The outdated model, Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, Madrid Iberomesornis romerali was more derived physically than Archaeopteryx. The basal characteristic of a long tail had been lost and the coracoid was longer. The vertebrate column of Iberomesornis ended in a pygostyle: a splint of bone made of fused tail vertebrae that supports the tail feathers. The shorter tail and the higher position of the shoulder indicated by the strut-like coracoid ‚Äî allowing for a greater wing amplitude ‚Äî improved manoeuvrability, turning and swooping at speed. Low speed flying might have been impaired by the lack of a bony keel on the sternum as attachment for the flight muscles; it is uncertain whether a true foramen triosseum was present, through which a tendon could elevate and supinate the wing. In 1992 Iberomesornis was assigned to the Iberomesornithidae. At that time it was considered to possibly have been very basal, outside of the clade Ornithothoraces, as is reflected by its generic name. However, since the discovery of Iberomesornis, many more bird fossils have come to light in the quarries of Liaoning province, China. Well preserved specimens of Chinese species such as Sinornis and Confuciusornis have permitted scientists to better understand the birds' early fossil history. Today, Iberomesornis is seen as positioned within Ornithothoraces, as a basal member of the Enantiornithes.

In addition to the Meathouse Fork and Buckeye Creek, the largest tributaries of Middle Island Creek (ordered upstream to downstream) are Arnold Creek, which it collects on the boundary of Doddridge and Tyler counties; McElroy Creek, Indian Creek, Point Pleasant Creek, and Sancho Creek, each of which it collects in Tyler County; and Sugar Creek and McKim Creek, both of which it collects in Pleasants County.The National Map , accessed 2013-08-10 =The Jug= Middle Island Creek's most extreme meander forms a peninsula known as \\"the Jug,\\" located upstream of Middlebourne. The creek rounds a 7-mile (11 km) bend only to return to within 100 feet (30 m) of itself. Sometime prior to 1800, a settler named George Gregg had a mill race carved across the narrow point of the peninsula and harnessed the resulting hydropower for a gristmill and sawmill. These were destroyed by a flood in 1852, while later mills were subsequently built and also washed away by floods. In 1947 the West Virginia Conservation Commission constructed a low water bridge which substantially dammed the cut-through and restored a steady flow to the bend of the creek. The land encircled by the creek's loop is operated as a Wildlife Management Area by the state of West Virginia.

He also a member of the United States House of Representatives, serving Maryland's third Congressional district from 1845 until 1849. He was the second Maryland governor born in Virginia and was a minority party governor, who faced bitter opposition from an openly hostile legislature. Biography Thomas Watkins Ligon he was born on May 10, 1810, near Farmville, Virginia, the son of Thomas D. Ligon and Martha Watkins. He graduated from Hampden‚ÄìSydney College, then entered the University of Virginia. He graduated from Yale Law School and returned to Virginia where he was admitted to the bar. In 1833, he moved to Baltimore, Maryland where he practiced law for the next 20 years. On September 29, 1840, he married Sally Ann Dorsey and made his home in Ellicott City, Maryland. Mrs. Ligon died shortly after their marriage and he married her sister, Mary Tolly Dorsey. He had one son and one daughter. In 1843, he was elected to a seat in the Maryland House of Delegates from Howard County and in 1845, the Democrats nominated him for Congress. He defeated the incumbent John Wethered by a majority of about 1,000 votes, and was re-elected by a larger margin in 1847. He served in the Twenty-Ninth and Thirtieth Congresses, taking his seat on December 1, 1845 and retiring on March 3, 1849. In the gubernatorial election of 1853, the Whigs nominated Richard Johns Bowie of Montgomery County to face Ligon, who had been nominated by the Democrats. Ligon defeated his opponent by about 4,200 votes, but he and his party were in the minority in the Legislature. He was inaugurated on January 11, 1854, and he pledged himself to work for the establishment of a system of common schools, the improvement of Maryland‚Äôs soils, and increased aid to agriculture. All these were shortly forgotten, when he and his 'Know-Nothing' opponents in the Legislature came into conflict. He supported the foundation of an agricultural college with an experimental farm attached, a step which the Legislature later took when it established the old Maryland Agricultural College at College Park. The Know-Nothing Riot of 1856 occurred during his term. On January 13, 1858, following the election of his 'Know-Nothing' successor Thomas Holliday Hicks, Ligon retired to his Howard County estate 'Chatham' near Ellicott City. He died at his home on January 12, 1881, and was buried in the family cemetery. Legacy Ligon Road in the Ellicott City neighborhood of Dunloggin presumably bears his name. He once resided in the Brick House on the Pike, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. He also resided at White Hall, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

The film was produced and distributed by First National Pictures, a major Hollywood studio at the time, and stars Wallace Beery as Professor Challenger. It was directed by Harry O. Hoyt and featured pioneering stop motion special effects by Willis O'Brien, a forerunner of his work on the original King Kong. Doyle appears in a frontispiece to the film, absent from some extant prints. In 1998, The Lost World was deemed \\"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. Because of its age the film is in the public domain, and can be legally downloaded online. Plot The Lost World. From a lost expedition to a plateau in the borders of Peru, Brazil and Colombia, Paula White brings the journal of her father explorer Maple White to the eccentric Professor Challenger in London. The journal features sketches of dinosaurs which is enough proof for Challenger to publicly announce that dinosaurs still walk the earth. Met with ridicule at an academic meeting at the Zoological Hall, Challenger reluctantly accepts a newspaper's offer to finance a mission to rescue Maple White. Professor Challenger, Paula White, sportsman Sir John Roxton, news reporter Edward Malone (who is a friend of Roxton and wishes to go on the expedition to impress his fianc√©e), a skeptical professor Summerlee, an Indian servant Zambo, and Challenger's butler Austin leave for the plateau. At their campsite at the base of the plateau, the explorers are shocked when a large rock falls, sent their way by an Apeman perched on top of an overhead ledge. As the crew look up to see their attacker, Challenger spies overhead a Pteranodon (mistakenly calling it a Pterodactylus) killing and eating a young Toxodon which proves that the statements in Maple White's diary are true. Leaving Zambo and Austin at the camp, they cross a chasm onto the plateau by cutting down a tree and using it as a bridge, but it is knocked over by a Brontosaurus, leaving them trapped. The explorers witness various life-and- death struggles between the prehistoric beasts of the plateau. An Allosaurus attacks a Trachodon, and knocks it into a bog. The Allosaurus then attacks, and is driven off by a Triceratops. Eventually, the Allosaurus makes its way to the campsite and attacks the exploration party. It is finally driven off by Ed who tosses a torch into its mouth. Convinced that the camp is not safe, Ed climbs a tree to look for a new location, but is attacked by the apeman. Roxton succeeds in shooting the apeman, but the creature is merely wounded and escapes before he can finish him off. Meanwhile, an Agathaumas is attacked by the Allosaurus, and gores it to death. Suddenly, a Tyrannosaurus attacks and kills the Agathaumas, along with an unfortunate Pteranodon. The explorers then make preparations to live on the plateau potentially indefinitely. A catapult is constructed and during a search for Maple White, Roxton finds his remains, confirming his death. It is at this time that Ed confesses his love for Paula and the two are unofficially wed by Summerlee who used to be a minister. Shortly afterwards, as the paleontologists are observing the Brontosaurus, an Allosaurus attacks it and the Brontosaurus falls off the edge of the plateau, becoming trapped in a mud bank at the base of the plateau. Soon afterwards, a volcano erupts causing a mass stampede among the giant creatures of the lost world. The crew is saved when Paula's pet monkey Jocko climbs up the plateau carrying a rope. The crew use the rope to pull up a rope ladder constructed by Zambo and Austin and then climb down. As Ed makes his descent, he is again attacked by the apeman who pulls the rope ladder. The apeman is again shot and finally killed by Roxton. They discover the Brontosaurus that had been pushed off the plateau had landed softly in the mud of the river, trapped but still alive, and Challenger manages to bring it back to London, as he wants to put it on display as proof of his story. However, while being unloaded from the ship it escapes and causes havoc until it reaches Tower Bridge, where its massive weight causes a collapse, and it swims down the River Thames. Challenger is morose as the creature leaves. Ed discovers that the love he left in London has married in his absence, allowing him and Paula to be together. Roxton morosely but gallantly hides his love for Paula as Paula and Ed leave together, while two passersby note: \\"That's Sir John Roxton‚Äîsportsman.\\" Cast Film still featuring Stone, Love, and Hughes * Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as himself (appears in a frontispiece to the film, missing from some prints) * Bessie Love as Paula White * Lewis Stone as Sir John Roxton * Lloyd Hughes as Edward Malone * Wallace Beery as Professor Challenger * Arthur Hoyt as Professor Summerlee * Alma Bennett as Gladys Hungerford * Virginia Brown Faire as Marquette the half-caste girl (uncredited) * Bull Montana as Apeman/Gomez * Francis Finch-Smiles as Austin * Jules Cowles as Zambo * Margaret McWade as Mrs. Challenger * George Bunny as Colin McArdle * Charles Wellesley as Major Hibbard * Nelson MacDowell as Attorney (uncredited) * Chrispin Martin as Bearer/Cannibal (scenes deleted) * Jocko the monkey as himself * Mary the chimpanzee as herself (uncredited) Production This was the first feature-length film made in the United States, possibly the world, to feature model animation as the primary special effect, or stop motion animation in general. Willis O'Brien had previously, in 1918, worked on a film called The Ghost of Slumber Mountain that used stop motion photography. In The Lost World, he combined animated dinosaurs with live-action footage of human beings, but at first he was able to do this only by separating the frame into two parts (also known as split screen). As work went on, O'Brien's technique grew better and he could combine live-action and stop-motion footage in the same part of the screen. For the live action scenes, an open sewer behind the MGM studio in Los Angeles was used as a river. The dinosaurs of this film were based on the artwork of Charles R. Knight. Some of the dinosaur models used in the film came into the possession of collector Forrest J Ackerman. Doyle frequently mentioned that Professor Challenger, not Sherlock Holmes, was his favorite character among his creations. Reception In 1922, Conan Doyle showed O'Brien's test reel to a meeting of the Society of American Magicians, which included Harry Houdini. The astounded audience watched footage of a Triceratops family, an attack by an Allosaurus and some Stegosaurus footage. Doyle refused to discuss the film's origins. On the next day, The New York Times ran a front-page article about it, saying \\"(Conan Doyle's) monsters of the ancient world, or of the new world which he has discovered in the ether, were extraordinarily lifelike. If fakes, they were masterpieces\\". In April 1925, on a London-Paris flight by Imperial Airways, The Lost World became the first film to be shown to airline passengers. As film stock of the era was nitrate and highly flammable, this was a risky undertaking on a wood and fabric-hulled plane, a converted WW1 bomber, the Handley-Page O 400. This is the first dinosaur-oriented film hit, and it led to other dinosaur films, from King Kong to the Jurassic Park series.

Synopsis The play is set in Germany in 1932 and 1933, and concerns a group of friends caught up in the events of the fall of the Weimar Republic and the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. The plot is centered on a woman named Agnes Eggling, a middle-aged actress, and all of the action takes place in her apartment. The action is occasionally interrupted by scenes featuring Zillah, a young woman in the 1980s living in Long Island who believes that Reagan is becoming too much like Hitler. In the version performed by the New York Shakespeare Festival, Zillah has moved to Berlin. Zillah has fled to Germany out of frustration and anger at the growing power of the Republican Party in America during the 1980s. The play was based on Bertolt Brecht's 1938 work The Private Life of the Master Race. =2018 version= Kushner revised the script in 2018 to include a new character, Xillah, who only interacts with Zillah. As explained by the character in the 2019 Public Theater production, A Bright Room Called Day was a play he wrote 34 years ago that never worked until Donald Trump was elected and suddenly everyone wanted to produce it, so he decided to give it an update. Xillah serves as Kushner's own commentary on his play, occasionally cutting into the proceedings to comment on issues with the play and getting into arguments with his \\"failed theatrical device\\" Zillah on the content of the play. Throughout the play, the two characters frequently discuss Kushner's prior comparison of Hitler to Ronald Reagan with present-day Hitler comparisons to Donald Trump. Zillah spends much of the play asking Xillah to write a new ending where she can interact with Agnes instead of having her just write hate mail to Ronald Reagan, while Xillah insists it is na√Øve to think one can speak to the dead. The result has been characterized by Kushner and Oskar Eustis (who directed the original Eureka production and the Public Theater revival) as turning the play from a critique of the American right to a discussion on the role of art as social or political action. Production history A Bright Room Called Day was first presented in a workshop production by Heat & Light Co., Inc., at Theatre 22 in New York City in April 1985, directed by Kushner himself. The play premiered at the Eureka Theatre in San Francisco, California in October 1987, directed by Oskar Eustis. In January 1991, it was produced at the Joseph Papp Public Theater by the New York Shakespeare Festival, where it was directed by Michael Greif. The segments of the play set in the 1930s remained substantially the same throughout the various productions, but Zillah's interruptions changed drastically from version to version. Her scenes were the primary point of contention for critics of the show, some of whom took offense at her comparisons of Ronald Reagan to Adolf Hitler. In 2009, A Bright Room Called Day was translated into French by Hillary Keegin and Pauline Le Diset. It was presented by I Girasoli at the Th√©atre de la Boutonni√®re, Paris, France in January 2010 under the title Bright Room. In July to August 2014, the play got its first London revival at the Southwark Playhouse, directed by Sebastian Harcombe. In February 2018 a revised version of the play, titled \\"A Bright Room Called Day (Revisited)\\", was performed at the University of Southern California School of Dramatic Arts. The revised version included the addition of the character Xillah, who also interrupts the play and comments on the modern parallels of the play in contrast to the parallels made to 1985. The production was directed by David Warshofsky. Oskar Eustis helmed a revival of the play at the Public Theater in the fall of 2019, running from October 29 to December 22 after two extensions from an original end date of December 8. The production, using the revised version of the script, featured Nikki M. James as Agnes, Michael Urie as Gregor, Linda Emond as Annabella, Jonathan Hadary as Xillah, and Estelle Parsons as Die √Ñlte, with Michael Esper as Vealtninc, Grace Gummer as Paulinka, Crystal Lucas-Perry as Zillah, Nadine Malouf as Rosa Malek, Mark Margolis as Gottfried Swetts, and Max Woertendyke as Emil Traum. Hayley Levitt of TheaterMania noted the revised script resembled a commentary on an old play rather than a revival of the play itself. Critics * \\"Tony Kushner's A Bright Room Called Day...is unabashedly political, thought- provoking, a little scary, and frequently a good deal of theatrical fun. ...Bright Room is...an examination of Nazi Germany in an attempt to shed insight on our own time. It's brash, audacious, and, depending on your politics, anything from infuriatingly naive to intoxicatingly visionary. In its 1932-33 span, it tells of a group of Berlin artists and friends, with varying degrees of communist leanings, and of the changes in their lives as democracy falls and Adolph Hitler takes over.\\" Sid Smith, Chicago Tribune * \\"It's fun to see a show this engaged. This passionate and ready to talk. Wild, uneven, pugnacious, ragged, committed, smart, dumb, satirical, and utterly serious. Always dramatically and intellectually forceful. And most important, always passionately committed.

What little is known about him comes from 8th-century writer Bede, but inconsistencies between various works have led to confusion about the exact circumstances of Wighard's election and whether he was ever confirmed in that office. What is clear is that he died in Rome after travelling there for confirmation by the papacy of his elevation to the archbishopric. His death allowed Pope Vitalian to select the next archbishop from amongst the clergy in Rome. Life Wighard was a Saxon priest during the late 7th century, and a native of Kent.Bateson \\"Wigheard\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He served in the household of Archbishop Deusdedit of Canterbury,Stenton Anglo-Saxon England p. 130 and was also a priest at Canterbury. The 8th-century writer Bede says that Wighard was selected to be Archbishop of Canterbury, and that he was sent to Rome to visit Pope Vitalian for confirmation and to receive his pallium.Hindley Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons p. 47 How exactly he was selected, and when that occurred, is open to debate, as Bede himself had two different stories. The first one, related in his Historia Abbatum, stated that Wighard was selected by King Ecgberht of Kent. Fifteen years after Bede's completion of the Historia Abbatum, Bede wrote the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, which states that Wighard was selected by Oswiu of Northumbria and Ecgberht with the consent of all the clergy and people.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury pp. 69‚Äì70 Some modern historians have followed Bede's second account, but others feel that only Ecgberht selected Wighard. The case for excluding Oswiu from any role in Wighard's election is based on the theory that Bede misinterpreted a letter from Vitalian to Oswiu as stating that Oswiu was involved in the selection. The historian Nicholas Brooks points out that although Bede may have indeed misread Vitalian's letter, Oswiu had other reasons for involving himself in Deusdedit's replacement, not least of which was a concern that the exiled Northumbrian bishop Wilfrid, who was in Kent and Mercia at the time, not be selected as the new archbishop. The historian D. P. Kirby sees Oswiu's involvement in Wighard's selection as an attempt to help restore the Anglo-Saxon church, and perhaps as the beginning of steps to secure York as an archbishopric.Kirby Earliest English Kings pp. 89‚Äì90 Brooks points out that one reason Wighard might have journeyed to Rome was to receive his pallium. As it had been the normal practice up until then to have it sent out to England by the papacy, Wighard's travel to Rome would indicate the papacy's approval of his election and ensure the validity of his consecration.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury p. 134 Bede, who is the main source for this information, is unclear on his chronology relating to Wighard. At one point in the Historia Ecclesiastica, he states that Canterbury had been vacant for some time before Wighard's election, but in other writings he implies that Wighard was appointed soon after the conclusion of the Council of Whitby,Abels \\"Council of Whitby\\" Journal of British Studies pp. 14‚Äì15 which likely took place in 664.Abels \\"Council of Whitby\\" Journal of British Studies p. 24 However Wighard was selected, he died in Rome. His death possibly occurred around 664,Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 213 but could have been as late as 667.Blair Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England p. 135 It may have been caused by the bubonic plague, or perhaps was due to some other disease epidemic. Like much else in his life, it is unclear if he was actually consecrated before his death. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for Wighard states that he died before consecration. The historian Peter Blair, however, states that Wighard died as he was about to head home to Canterbury, after his consecration.Blair Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England p. 142 Pope Vitalian wrote to Oswiu after Wighard's death, and this letter is preserved by Bede in his Historia Ecclesiastica. In the letter, which also mentions that a messenger from Oswiu had been among the companions of the archbishop-elect, the pope apologises that he has been unable to find a successor to Wighard yet. Wighard's death in Rome allowed Vitalian the opportunity to choose his successor, and Vitalian chose his friend Theodore of Tarsus to become the next archbishop.

When this occurs, the two nuclei of two cells pair off and cohabit without fusing (karyogamy). This can be maintained for all the cells of the hyphae by synchronously dividing so that pairs are passed to newer cells. In the Ascomycota this attribute is most often found in the ascogenous hyphae and ascocarp while the bulk of the mycelium remains monokaryotic. In the Basidiomycota this is the dominant phase, with most Basidiomycota monokaryons weakly growing and short-lived. The formation of a dikaryon is a plesiomorphic character for the subkingdom Dikarya, which consists of the Basidiomycota and the Ascomycota. The formation of croziers in the Ascomycota and of clamp connections in the Basidiomycota facilitates maintenance of the dikaryons. However, some fungi in each of these phyla have evolved other methods for maintaining the dikaryons, and therefore neither croziers nor clamp connections are ubiquitous in either phylum.

Based on the short story Abataranika by Narendranath Mitra, it tells the story of a housewife who disconcerts her traditionalist family by getting a job as a saleswoman. It marks the first screen appearance of Jaya Bhaduri Bachchan, then aged 15, who later became one of Bollywood's leading actresses. Shot in the first half of 1963 in Calcutta, this was also the first film directed by Ray set entirely in his native Calcutta, reflecting contemporary realities of the urban middle-class, where women going to work is no longer merely driven by ideas of emancipation but has become an economic reality. The film examines the effects of the confident working woman on patriarchial attitudes and social dynamics. Besides The Apu Trilogy, the film, according to veteran film critic Philip French, is one of Ray's greatest films. Plot Set in Calcutta during the 1950s, Mahanagar explores the evolving independence of middle-class women of the city. Arati (Madhabi Mukherjee), a homemaker, takes a job as a door-to-door saleswoman to meet the increasing financial pressure on her orthodox and conservative family, who share a cramped apartment. Despite the disapproval of her father-in-law, Priyogopal (Haren Chatterjee), the hesitant and nervous Arati soon begins to prosper in her field and gradually starts to enjoy her new-found financial and psychological independence. Her initially supportive husband, Subrata (Anil Chatterjee), starts to feel insecure and asks Arati to quit her job after he tentatively secures another part-time job. Before Arati can quit, Subrata loses his full- time job when the bank he was working for shuts down in the last of the Calcutta bank crashes. Subrata has no choice but to let Arati continue to work. Arati now becomes the sole breadwinner of the family. She befriends an Anglo-Indian colleague, Edith (Vicky Redwood), a move which raises suspicion and increases conflict within her family. Slowly Arati begins to shine in her job and earn the trust of her manager, who promises her more responsibilities if she continues to work with efficiency. Priyogopal, a retired schoolteacher, visits several of his former pupils who are now prospering in their chosen professions to solicit funds (after refusing to accept money from Arati). One of them, an optometrist, gives Priyogopal a badly needed pair of eyeglasses. Another of his ex-pupils, a doctor who provides free medical care after Priyogopal falls down a flight of stairs, chastises Subrata for neglecting his father's material needs. Meanwhile, Subrata spends his days idly at home and is consumed by suspicion and insecurity. Subrata finally decides to meet Arati's boss, Himangshu (Haradhan Bannerjee), to ease some of his suspicions. He finds that Himangshu is an affable and friendly person who, like him, hails from Pabna District. They discuss Subrata's unemployment and Himangshu promises to find him a job somewhere. Edith returns to work after a long illness, but Himangshu doubts she was actually sick and fires her, citing her frivolous lifestyle. Arati discovers her crying and persuades Edith to tell her why she is upset. Despite being the sole breadwinner of the family, the previously timid Arati abandons her inhibitions and confronts Himangshu over his unjust firing of Edith. After a heated exchange in which her boss refuses to apologize to Edith, Arati hands in her resignation letter and storms off. On her way out of the office, she meets Subrata, apologizes to him for impulsively quitting her job, and admits she is scared of the future. Subarata realizes that his wife has shown courage rather than meekly submitting to her boss to sustain her livelihood. He placates Arati and tells her that he believes some day they both will get jobs to support their family.

It is a revision and expansion of his previously published novella Baby is Three, which is bracketed by two additional parts written for the novel (\\"The Fabulous Idiot\\" and \\"Morality\\"). Theodore Sturgeon, as quoted in the \\"Baby is Three\\" story notes, The Complete Stories, vol VI It won the 1954 International Fantasy Award, which was also given to works in science fiction. It was additionally nominated in 2004 for a \\"Retro Hugo\\" award for the year 1954. Science fiction critic and editor David Pringle included it in his book Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels. Simon & Schuster published a graphic novel version of More Than Human in 1978, titled Heavy Metal Presents Theodore Sturgeon's More Than Human. It was illustrated by Alex Ni√±o and scripted by Doug Moench.Heavy Metal Presents Theodore Sturgeon's More Than Human at the Grand Comics Database  Plot introduction  The novel concerns the coming together of six extraordinary people with strange powers who are able to \\"blesh\\" (a portmanteau of \\"blend\\" and \\"mesh\\") their abilities together. In this way, they are able to act as one organism. They progress toward a mature gestalt consciousness, called the homo gestalt, the next step in the human evolution. Plot summary The first part of the novel, The Fabulous Idiot, narrates the birth of the gestalt. In the beginning, we are introduced to the world of Lone, referred to as the \\"Idiot\\", a 25-year-old male with a telepathic ability who lives on the street. He knows he can make people do what he wants them to, but has never experienced real human connection. One day he encounters Evelyn Kew, an innocent woman who has been completely sheltered by her domineering father. She is the first person he has mentally and physically connected with. Evelyn's father finds out about the relationship and kills Evelyn and himself. During this incident Lone barely escapes a beating from the father; bleeding and nearly dead, he is found and then adopted by the Prodds, a poor farming couple, and lives with them for about seven years. When Mrs. Prodd becomes pregnant, the couple are about to ask Lone to leave, but he makes his departure appear to be his own idea. Lone builds a shelter in the forest and is soon joined by three runaway children: Janie, an eight-year-old with a telekinetic gift, and the twins Bonnie and Beanie, who cannot speak but possess the ability to teleport. Lone returns to the farm to find Mrs. Prodd has died after giving birth to a \\"Mongoloid\\" baby. Lone adopts the baby, who has a phenomenal mental capacity and thinks almost like a computer. Together, Lone, Janie, the twins and Baby form what will be later called the homo gestalt. Prodd's old truck is always getting stuck in the mud, and when Lone asks Baby for a solution, Baby helps Lone build an anti-gravity generator. He installs it in Prodd's truck, only to find that Prodd has left for Pennsylvania. The second part of the novel is Baby is Three, which occurs several years after The Fabulous Idiot. Gerry Thompson, a street urchin who has grown up in abusive institutions, is possibly sociopathic. He consults a psychiatrist, trying to piece his memory back together. Gerry ran away from the institution and was taken in by Lone. Lone was killed in an accident and Gerry subsequently became the leader of the gestalt. Lone had instructed the children to seek out Evelyn's sister, Alicia, after his death. They were educated and fed under her care. Soon, however, Gerry learned that domestication and normalization had weakened their gestalt. He killed Alicia, and the group returned to living alone in the woods. If anything, Gerry's telepathic abilities are stronger than Lone's. His amnesia was caused by Alicia's having accidentally transmitted her memories to his mind when they first met, triggered by her strong emotional reaction to hearing the words \\"Baby is three\\". He learned about her entire life, including her past relationship with Lone, in a split second. After being helped by the psychiatrist, Gerry erases the man's memory of him. The third and concluding part of the novel is Morality. Again, it occurs several years after the previous part. Lt. Hip (Hippocrates) Barrows is a gifted engineer who worked for the US Air Force until the incident which led to his incarceration, first in an insane asylum, then in jail. Janie, now an adult, befriends him and helps him regain his health. He slowly remembers what had happened. He discovered some odd effects on an anti-aircraft range. Practice shells fired in a certain area were all duds. Barrows does magnetic tests and finally discovers the anti-gravity machine, still on the rusted-out old truck on the nearby farm. Gerry knows of Hip's investigation and poses as a common soldier assisting Hip, then launching the anti-grav into space and stopping Hip from saving it. He then mentally attacks Hip to make him look insane, driving him to a mental breakdown and amnesia, Gerry does this because Baby has told him that if the anti-grav was discovered, it would lead either to a terrible war or to the complete collapse of the world economy. Gerry is determined to drive Hip permanently insane. Hip confronts Gerry, and becomes the last part of the gestalt, its conscience. As a result of this completion, the gestalt is at last telepathically greeted by, and welcomed into, the pre-existing community of other gestalts around the world. > He saw himself as an atom and his _gestalt_ as a molecule. He saw these > others as a cell among cells, and he saw in the whole the design of what, > with joy, humanity would become. > > He felt a rising, choking sense of worship, and recognized it for what it > has always been for mankind ‚Äï self-respect. Reception New York Times reviewer Villiers Gerson placed the novel among its year's best, praising it for \\"a poetic, moving prose and a deeply examined raison d'etre.\\"\\"Spaceman's Realm\\", The New York Times Book Review, November 22, 1953, p.34 Groff Conklin described More Than Human as \\"a masterpiece of invention... written in an unmannered prose that still has a poetic, panchromatic individuality.\\"\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, March 1954, p.118-19 Boucher and McComas praised it for \\"its crystal-clear prose, its intense human warmth and its depth of psychological probing\\" as well as its \\"adroit plotting and ceaseless surge of action,\\" finding it \\"one of the most impressive proofs yet of the possibility of science fiction as a part of mainstream literature.\\"\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, February 1954, p.93. P.

W.

She sometimes was called \\"The Black Patti\\" in reference to Italian opera singer Adelina Patti. Jones' repertoire included grand opera, light opera, and popular music. Trained at the Providence Academy of Music and the New England Conservatory of Music, Jones made her New York debut in 1888 at Steinway Hall, and four years later she performed at the White House for President Benjamin Harrison. She eventually sang for four consecutive presidents and the British royal family, and met with international success. Besides the United States and the West Indies, Jones toured in South America, Australia, India, southern Africa, and Europe. The highest-paid African-American performer of her time, later in her career she founded the Black Patti Troubadours (later renamed the Black Patti Musical Comedy Company), a musical and acrobatic act made up of 40 jugglers, comedians, dancers and a chorus of 40 trained singers. She remained the star of the Famous Troubadours for around two decades while they established their popularity in the principal cities of the United States and Canada, Jones retired from performing in 1915. In 2013 she was inducted into the Rhode Island Music Hall of Fame. Early life and education Matilda Sissieretta Joyner was born on January 5, 1869, in a house on Bart Street in Portsmouth, Virginia, United States, to Jeremiah Malachi Joyner, an African Methodist Episcopal minister and Henrietta Beale, a singer in a church choir and washerwoman. Her father had formerly been enslaved, but was educated and literate. She was the oldest of three children, although her siblings died when they were young. Matilda Joyner was nicknamed as Sissy or Tilly by her family and friends, and began singing around the house at a young age. When she was six years old, her family moved to Providence, Rhode Island, where she began singing at an early age in her father's Pond Street Baptist Church. She attended Meeting Street and Thayer Schools. In 1883, Joyner began the formal study of music at the Providence Academy of Music. She studied with Ada Baroness Lacombe. In the late 1880s, Jones was accepted at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, studying under Flora Batson of the Bergen Star Company. She also studied at the Boston Conservatory. Musical career =Debut and breakthrough concerts= On October 29, 1885, Jones gave a solo performance in Providence as an opening act to a production of Richard III put on by John A. Arneaux's theatre troupe.Lee, Maureen D. Sissieretta Jones:\\" the Greatest Singer of Her Race,\\" 1868‚Äì1933. Univ of South Carolina Press, 2013. p10 In 1887, she performed at Boston's Music Hall before an audience of 5,000. Jones made her New York debut on April 5, 1888, at Steinway Hall. During a performance at Wallack's Theater in New York, Jones came to the attention of Adelina Patti's manager, who recommended that Jones tour the West Indies with the Fisk Jubilee Singers. Jones made successful tours of the Caribbean in 1888 and 1892. Around this time one critic at the theatrical journal the New York Clipper dubbed her \\"the Black Patti\\" after Adelina Patti, an epithet that Jones disliked, preferring Madame Jones. She later told a reporter that the name \\"rather annoys me... I am afraid people will think I consider myself the equal to Patti herself. I assure you I don't think so, but I have a voice and I am striving to win the favor of the public by honest merit and hard work.\\" In February 1892, Jones performed at the White House for President Benjamin Harrison. She eventually sang for four consecutive presidents ‚Äî Harrison, Grover Cleveland, William McKinley, and Theodore Roosevelt ‚Äî and the British royal family. For three of her White House performances, Jones had to enter the building through the back. She was finally allowed to enter through the front door for the Roosevelt performance. Jones in an 1889 posterThis is the only portrait poster of an African-American performer held by the Library of Congress Performing Arts Posters collection from the period of Jones' career. Jones performed at the Grand Negro Jubilee at New York's Madison Square Garden in April 1892 before an audience of 75,000. She sang the song \\"Swanee River\\" and selections from La traviata. She was so popular that she was invited to perform at the Pittsburgh Exposition (1892) and the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago (1893). In June 1892, Jones became the first African American to sing at the Music Hall in New York (renamed Carnegie Hall the following year). Among the selections in her program were Charles Gounod's \\"Ave Maria\\" and Giuseppe Verdi's \\"Sempre libera\\" (from La traviata). The New York Echo wrote of her performance at the Music Hall: \\"If Mme Jones is not the equal of Adelina Patti, she at least can come nearer it than anything the American public has heard. Her notes are as clear as a mockingbird's and her annunciation perfect.\\" =Expanded venues and international success= On June 8, 1892, her venue options expanded, she received a contract with the possibility of a two-year extension, for $150 per week (plus expenses) with Major James B. Pond, who had meaningful affiliations to many authors and musicians and also managed artists such as Mark Twain and Henry Ward Beecher, and her fees began to rise. She received $2,000 for a week-long appearance at the Pittsburgh Exposition, noted for being the highest fee ever paid to a black artist in the United States. By comparison, Adelina Patti was paid $4,000 a night. In 1893, Jones met composer Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k. On January 23, 1894, Dvo≈ô√°k included Jones as a featured soloist during his benefit concert for the New York Herald's Free Clothing Fund at the Madison Square Garden Concert Hall. In addition to singing an arrangement of Rossini's Stabat Mater with the \\"colored male choir of St. Philip's church,\\" Jones performed Dvo≈ô√°k's arrangement of Stephen Foster's \\"Old Folks at Home\\".Locke, Ralph and Cyrilla Barr. Cultivating Music in America: Women Patrons and Activists since 1860. Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1997. By 1895, she had become the \\"most well known and highly paid\\" performer of African-American heritage of her time. Jones met with international success. Besides the United States and the West Indies, Jones toured in South America, Australia, India, and southern Africa. During a European tour in 1895 and 1896, Jones performed in London, Paris, Berlin, Cologne, Munich, Milan, and Saint Petersburg. She noted in her letters that she encountered less racial prejudice in Europe, and that performers' skin color was irrelevant to their reception by audiences. By 1896, she also had become frustrated with racism limiting her venues in the United States, particularly when the Metropolitan Opera, which considered her for a lead role, rescinded that opportunity because of her race. =Black Patti Troubadours= 1898 newspaper advertisement for the Black Patti Troubadours In 1896, Jones returned to Providence to care for her mother, who had become ill. Jones found that access to most American classical concert halls was limited by racism. She formed the Black Patti Troubadours (later renamed the Black Patti Musical Comedy Company), a musical and acrobatic act made up of 40 jugglers, comedians, dancers and a chorus of 40 trained singers. The Black Patti Troubadours reveled in vernacular music and dance. The revue paired Jones with rising vaudeville composers Bob Cole and Billy Johnson. The show consisted of a musical skit, followed by a series of short songs and acrobatic performances. During the final third of each show, Jones performed arias and operatic excerpts, although ‚Äúlow‚Äù comedy, song and dance were also showcased in what was originally a ‚Äúfree-for-all‚Äù variety production with no pretense of a coherent story line. The Indianapolis Freeman reviewed the ‚ÄúBlack Patti Troubadours‚Äù with the following: ‚ÄúThe rendition which she and the entire company give of this reportorial opera selection is said to be incomparably grand. Not only is the solo singing of the highest order, but the choruses are rendered with a spirit and musical finish which never fail to excite genuine enthusiasm.\\" As the show grew more organized by the early 1900s, she had added scenery and costumes to her opera excerpts, and there were definite plots and musical comedy where she appeared in the storyline. The revue provided Jones with a comfortable income, reportedly in excess of $20,000 per year. She led the company with reassurance of a forty-week season that would give her a sustainable income, guaranteed lodging in a well- appointed and stylish Pullman car, and the ability to sing opera and operetta excerpts in the final section of the show. She was the highest-paid African- American performer of her time, remaining the star of the Famous Troubadours for around two decades while they toured each season and established their popularity in the principal cities of the United States and Canada. The company Troubadours made an important statement about the capabilities of black performers to its predominantly white audiences showing that there were diverse artist genres and styles besides minstrelsy. Their eventual fame and international tours collected many audiences, and several members of the troupe, such as Bert Williams, went on to become famous. In April 1908, at the Avenue Theatre in Louisville, Kentucky where segregated seating was still prevalent, her rendition of \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" was well-received by a primarily white audience, resulting in ‚Äúthe first time that a colored performer received a bouquet at the theatre in [the city of St. Louis].\\" The troupe also performed many times in the new theaters with black owners such as the Howard in Washington, D.C. Shows for the troupe included A Trip to Africa (1909 and 1910), In the Jungles (1911 and 1912), Captain Jaspar (1912 and 1913) and Lucky Sam from Alabam (1914 and 1915). She did not participate fully in the 1913‚Äì1914 season due to illness, and the following year the company disbanded. Her final two performances were at the Grand Theater in Chicago and the Lafayette Theater in New York City in October 1915, promising her audiences that she would return. Jones retired from performing in 1915. =Legacy= W.C. Handy edited a songbook in 1944 which included a song about her; the book is called Unsung Americans Sung. In the 1967 book Black Magic by Milton Meltzer and Langston Hughes, she was described as a \\"stunning woman with a beautiful voice\\". Jones was also written about in Olio, which is a book of poetry written by Tyehimba Jess that was released in 2016. That book won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. As of 2003, several dresses from her early stage career were maintained by the Rhode Island Heritage Society. As of 2013, the Rhode Island Black Heritage Society was seeking funds to restore a performance dress worn by Jones in the 1890s, after the yellow silk and embroidered gown deteriorated. Her restored wedding gown at the time was on display at the John Brown House Museum in Providence. A plaque marks the area where Jones' home stood on Wheaton Street on Providence's East Side A biography of Jones by Maureen Lee, titled Sissieretta Jones: The Greatest Singer of her Race, was published in May 2012. The research for the book was partly based on a scrapbook of Jones which was on display at Howard University. At the same time, a plaque honoring Jones was erected near the location of Jones' home on the East Side of Providence. In 2013 Jones was inducted into the Rhode Island Music Hall of Fame. In 2018, the New York Times published a belated obituary for her. Before her death in 2019, the great American soprano Jessye Norman was \\"in the planning stages for 'Call Her By Her Name!', a multi-media tribute\\" to Jones. Personal life In 1883 she married David Richard Jones, a news dealer and hotel bellman, when she was 14 years old. He served as her first manager. She filed for divorce in 1898, citing his drunkenness and lack of support. She divorced him in 1899 for his misuse of their money and gambling. In 1915 her mother fell ill, so Jones retired from performing and moved back to Rhode Island to take care of her. She devoted the remainder of her life to her church and to caring for her mother, also taking in homeless children and caring for her two adopted children. She lived off her holdings for a number of years, but was eventually forced to sell most of her property to survive, including most of her medals and jewels and three of her four houses. In her final years, the president of the local NAACP chapter helped pay her taxes and water bill, and provided her family with coal and wood. Jones' headstone in Grace Church Cemetery She died in poverty on June 24, 1933, from cancer at the Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island. She did not have the money to pay for a gravestone upon her death, and is buried in her hometown at Grace Church Cemetery. In 2018, money was raised to finally place a headstone on her grave; the headstone was placed there in June of that year.

Seeds that contain fats and oils include corn, soybean, sunflower, peanut and pumpkin. As in all peroxisomes, in glyoxysomes the fatty acids are oxidized to acetyl-CoA by peroxisomal Œ≤-oxidation enzymes. When the fatty acids are oxidized hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is produced as oxygen (O2) is consumed. Thus the seeds need oxygen to germinate. Besides peroxisomal functions, glyoxysomes possess additionally the key enzymes of glyoxylate cycle (isocitrate lyase and malate synthase) which accomplish the glyoxylate cycle bypass. Thus, glyoxysomes (as all peroxisomes) contain enzymes that initiate the breakdown of fatty acids and additionally possess the enzymes to produce intermediate products for the synthesis of sugars by gluconeogenesis. The seedling uses these sugars synthesized from fats until it is mature enough to produce them by photosynthesis. Plant peroxisomes also participate in photorespiration and nitrogen metabolism in root nodules.  References   External links  * Sengbusch, Peter V.

Propalladia Life After some years of soldiering and of captivity in Algiers, Torres Naharro took holy orders, settled in Rome about 1511, and there devoted himself chiefly to writing plays. Though he alludes to the future pope, Clement VII, as his protector, he left Rome to enter the household of Fabrizio Colonna at Naples as a chaplain where his works were printed under the title of Propaladia (1517). He is conjectured to have returned to his native place, and to have died there shortly after 1529.

He classifies his pieces as comedias √° noticia and comedias √° fantas√≠a; the former, of which the Soldatesca and Tinellaria are examples, present in dramatic form incidents within his personal experience; the latter, which include such plays as Serafina, Himenea, Calamita and Aquilana, present imaginary episodes with adroitness and persuasiveness.

It was awarded a CableACE Award in 1984 for Best Dramatic Film. The film stars Roy Scheider as Billy Young, an aging baseball player for the Detroit Tigers, and Justin Henry as Alex, a young fan who believes in him. Tiger Town originally aired October 9, 1983 on the Disney Channel. The film was written and directed by Detroit native Alan Shapiro and executive produced by Susan B. Landau. It was subsequently aired on ABC's Disney Sunday Movie, and had a limited theatrical release in the Detroit area in June 1984, which (coincidentally) was during Tigers‚Äô best season in franchise history. Most of the film was shot on location at Tiger Stadium and in the city of Detroit. One notable goof in the film shows Alex racing his bicycle across a bridge over the Detroit River on the way to the stadium. The bridge is the one leading from the Detroit mainland to Belle Isle Park, an island park where there is no residential area. Plot description Alex (Henry) and his father (Ron McLarty) are devoted Detroit Tigers fans, even now as they are struggling. Alex's favorite player is aging star Billy Young (Scheider), who is having a sub-par season, which is also his last. His only remaining wish is to play in the World Series before retiring. Alex's father dies unexpectedly, but not before he tells Alex that he should always believe. Consequently, Alex decides to visit every Tiger home game. Every time Young comes to the plate, Alex closes his eyes and wishes hard, and Young ends up hitting a home run. Thanks to Young's rejuvenated play, the Tigers start winning again. But there is a price. Alex, who now believes that if he doesn't go to the games, the team will lose (explaining the Tigers' pitiful road trips); finds himself the subject of ridicule by classmates, since he often sneaks out of school early to watch the Tigers play. Nevertheless, thanks to Billy Young, the Tigers claw their way back into the pennant race. The final game of the season, against the Baltimore Orioles, would decide the pennant. Alex has his ticket and school lets out early so kids can watch the game, but as Alex leaves school, he is detained by a gang of bullies who take his ticket and his money. Only when Alex gets his principal's attention is he released and forced to run all the way to Tiger Stadium. Bribing a little girl for her bike and hanging onto the back of a city bus gets Alex to the stadium in time for the ninth inning, where Young is up and the Tigers are trailing. Young makes contact with the ball just as Alex gets to the front of the stadium aisle, and Young ends up clearing the bases, giving the Tigers the American League East title and securing a chance to play in the American League Championship Series, thus one step closer to Young's wish to play in the World Series. Cameos Several Detroit broadcasters and celebrities appear as themselves in the movie. Tigers manager Sparky Anderson appears frequently in the movie. Mary Wilson, a former Supreme, sings the national anthem before the final game.

The peerage was where the king would turn for military, judicial and administrative purposes, and the ruler who ignored his nobility, like Edward II, did so at great risk to his position. The peerage can perhaps best be compared to the cabinets of modern-day Prime Ministers or Presidents, though their power and responsibilities were much wider. The emergence of Parliament did not seriously erode the power of the nobility until, at the earliest, the 17th century.

The station serves all of northern lower Michigan from Traverse City to Alpena. History The station was started by Roy Henderson in April 1979 at 97.7, playing a CHR/Top 40 format as \\"Kilt 98\\". Due to its limited signal, the station found it difficult to compete with the high-powered WJML-FM and WKHQ, and so in 1981 the station changed format to automated country as \\"Country 98\\". The station added an AM station at 1420 in 1982, which simulcasted the FM's format. The AM station, WKLT, was a 500-watt daytimer. In 1982, WKLT became the Grand Traverse region's first AOR station, when Roy Henderson moved to Texas full-time, selling WKLT to a Pepsi-Cola distribution company based in North Dakota. (Northern Broadcast, a division of Northern Bottling, also owns Classic Hits WFDX 92.5 The Fox and News/Talk WSRT 106.7/105.5, formerly WKPK, \\"106.7 The Peak\\".) The new AOR format was the first of its kind in northern Michigan and gave listeners an alternative to the Top 40 fare played on WJML and WKHQ. It was during this period that WKLT would be known to its listeners as \\"98 Rock\\". In 1991, WKLT moved to 97.5, boosting power to 32,000 watts and the company purchased WJML in Petoskey (which by that time had shifted to an adult contemporary format in response to competition from WKHQ and WKPK). The company spun off WJML/1110 to local broadcaster Rick Stone (who still owns the station with a news/talk format) and WKLT to the Kalkaska School system, who has since shut the station down for good. WJML-FM 98.9 became WKLZ and Double Rock KLT was born. It can be heard as far north as Sault Ste Marie, Ontario, Canada, as far west as Manistique, and as far south as Lake City. Throughout the 1990s, the station, and Northern Broadcast, were managed by Richard Dills of Grand Rapids. Dills, former General Manager of WKLQ-FM modeled WKLT after WKLQ even going so far as to copy the KLQ logo for KLT. In 2005, Charlie Ferguson took over the GM position at Northern Broadcast after a long stint in Minot, North Dakota, Northern Radio's home city. The Double Rock slogan was changed to \\"The Rock Station\\" reflecting the long history of the station. With the change, listeners have noted that the station has become more heavily gold-based than before but that they still plays some currents as well. Mid- day personality and Program Director Terri Ray has become a Northern Michigan icon. She came to KLT in January 1984. She hosts the highly rated noon time request show \\"Lunch at the Leetsville Cafe\\" for 3 plus decades. Terri Ray is also the host of a local music feature called \\"KLT's Garage\\" that airs on Sunday night's at 9. WKLT has featured the House Of Blues Radio Hour since the program went into syndication in the early 1990s, along with the daily Blues Breaks which are hosted by Elwood Blues AKA Dan Akroyd. In August 2008 a construction permit was granted for FM translator W281AY 104.1 Alpena.

Combat was one of the eight great resistance movements which constituted the Conseil national de la R√©sistance.  Combat's development  Combat, also known under its former name (MLN), was active both in the unoccupied zone in southern France and in the occupied north. = Birth and growth = Combat was created in August 1940 in Lyon by Henri Frenay, supported by Berty Albrecht. Through a system of regional heads, he spread the movement through six regions within the free zone: * Lyon (10 d√©partements)................... (R1) led jointly by Marcel Peck and Andr√© Plaisantin * Marseille (7 d√©partements)............... (R2) * Montpellier (6 d√©partements)............ (R3) * Toulouse (9 d√©partements)............... (R4) * Limoges (9 d√©partements)................ (R5), led until 1943 by Edmond Michelet * Clermont-Ferrand (5 d√©partements)... (R6) New regions appeared later, particularly in the north of France (e.g. Jura and Brittany). Little by little, the MLN (subsequently renamed the Mouvement de Lib√©ration Fran√ßaise), merged with other smaller networks in the regions where it took root. On merging with the Libert√© network at the end of 1941, the movement took on the name of Combat. At this point, however, Combat took a Gaullist approach, causing a split with other networks which tended towards Philippe P√©tain. The break caused Combat's sources of information to be diminished somewhat. A satellite organization by the name of Combat-zone nord, was also created in the occupied zone, specifically in Paris. The organiser was Robert Gu√©don, called Robert. Combat-zone nord proved to be quite active, quickly growing its network into several regions of the occupied zone such as the Nord-Pas-de-Calais . = Initial obstacles = Among the initial Combat members planted in the occupied zone, there was an agent of the Abwehr, Henri Devillers, involved in linking and communications between the parts of the movement in the free and occupied zones. Jean-Paul Lien, another member of combat, learned about Devilliers' treachery by accident from two German agents. Lien alerted Henri Frenay, who had no power to stop Devilliers. 47 members of Combat were arrested, 31 by the Gestapo and 16 by the French police, of whom only two would be released. They were tried by the Volkgerichthof (people's tribunal) and 23 were sentenced to death; this was referred to as the affaire Continent. The movement was completely disbanded in the occupied zone between the end of 1941 and the beginning of 1942. Frenay decided not to rebuild there but to concentrate all his efforts in the free zone. A new movement was born from the ashes of Combat-zone nord, Ceux de la R√©sistance, founded by Jacques Lecompte-Boinet. Frenay also declined repeated offers to put himself at the service of the Deuxi√®me Bureau of the Vichy Regime or of the Intelligence service of London, preferring to keep his independence and continue to fight for France alone rather than a foreign power. In the beginning of summer 1942, another network called Carte, which was directly linked to the British Special Operations Executive and therefore better armed at that time than the other French networks in the free zone, took over two of Combat's groups on the C√¥te d'Azur. Frenay sent a message to the SOE asking them to stop taking his teams away from him. It did not happen again. This may have been due to the displeasure expressed by Frenay in his message, or alternatively to the invasion of the free zone by the Germans a few months later. = 1943 = After the Allies landed in North Africa, the Germans invaded the free zone. This plunged Combat undercover, since they now had to deal with the well-organised Gestapo. Secrecy and security measures were reinforced. Messages were encrypted, rendezvous locations were specified by letters and generally were moved to outside Lyon, which became by degrees the capital of the French resistance. Arrests took place from February onwards, followed by escapes. Combat was infiltrated by Gestapo and Abwehr agents. In January, the idea of amalgamating the three big resistance movements of the south (Combat, Lib√©ration et Franc-Tireur) gradually gained ground, culminating between February and March in Mouvements unis de la R√©sistance (MUR). The steering committee of each movement lost much of its importance. Combat was represented on the steering committee of the MUR by Frenay, who was also the commissioner on military affairs of the three networks. The press of the three movements remained independent, and Combat's newspaper continued to exist in its own right. Combat's structure was unchanged by its affiliation to the MUR; it retained a steering committee, and branches for political and military affairs among others.  Internal organisation Combat was led by a steering committee, over which Frenay permanently presided. In March 1943, the other five members were Georges Bidault, Claude Bourdet, Maurice Chevance, Alfred Coste-Floret, Fran√ßois de Menthon (former head of Libert√©), et Pierre-Henri Teitgen. In January 1943, Combat contained a total of 14 specialised services and more than 100 permanent agents, paid by the network. The network was split into four branches: * External relations, led by Pierre B√©nouville. This oversaw a delegation to Switzerland, relations with the United States of America and the British services. The external relations branch became indispensable at the start of 1943, when Combat needed money and armaments which the English were slow in providing. One member of the branch, Phillippe Monod, made contact with the American Office of Strategic Services in Switzerland to procure these. The external branch became larger and more organized. The American OSS promised to give aid to the French resistance in the future, but this promise was not followed up after the British embassy opposed it, and General Charles de Gaulle forbade any further discussion on the matter. * Military affairs, led by Maurice Chevance, included the Groupes Francs of Jacques Renouvin, the Arm√©e secr√®te, the Maquis, and the Sabotage-Fer led by Ren√© Hardy. * Political affairs, led by Claude Bourdet, oversaw propaganda, the information service of Jean Gemahling. * The general secretariat, led by Berty Albrecht, was in charge of general services including lodging, false papers, finance and the service sociale (the service social was established in 1941, and allocated a small pension, income, goods and food to the families of resistance members who had been captured.) Initially Combat was mainly financed through gifts coming from all over France, solicited by Frenay from high-ranking members of society. This situation changed quickly, however, and soon most resources were provided from London, through the agency of Jean Moulin. At the beginning of 1943, the money received by Combat from London went up to five million Francs, of which Lib√©ration received 1.5 million, and Franc-Tireur, just under a million. Moulin tried to separate the different activities of the network, particularly the information and the Choc (shock, heavy military operations), following directions given to him in London. He finally won his case when the MUR was created.  Activities and operations  = The secret press = The activities of Combat originally revolved around the dispersal of information using secret newspapers. These pieces of information were provided to Frenay initially from army offices, then, after the disbandment of the French army, from the deuxi√®me bureau of the Vichy regime. Combat quickly distanced itself from Vichy, after which information was gathered through various resistance groups with which Combat had links. These pieces of information fed into newspapers which were published from time to time. In the beginning Frenay mainly distributed bulletins in army offices; these bulletins stopped after the army broke up. In the occupied zone, the newspaper Les Petites Ailes du Nord et du Pas-de-Calais (little wings of the North and Pas-de-Calais) appeared. In time it became Les Petites Ailes de France, then R√©sistance. In the free zone, an underground newspaper was established, modelled on Petites Ailes de France. Its name was V√©rit√©s (Truths). V√©rit√© (Truth) had been considered for the name, but was judged too philosophical; according to Frenay, the truth was difficult, if not impossible to express. After the merger of Combat with Libert√©, V√©rit√©s was scuttled and its place taken by a new newspaper bearing the name of the network, Combat. Other small journals also saw the light of day, but gradually separated from the Combat movement. Examples are Veritas and the Catholic-oriented Cahiers du T√©moignage Chr√©tien (Christian witness notebooks). These journals, particularly the important ones, contained propaganda articles against the Vichy regime, which revealed and criticised the actions of the government and state apparatus, as well as substantive pieces dealing with e.g. Nazism or collaboration. Frenay generally constructed the editorial of the Combat newspaper in person, until he joined de Gaulle in Algeria. The subtitle of the Combat newspaper was Organe du Mouvement de la Lib√©ration Fran√ßaise, accompanied by a quote from Georges Clemenceau: \\"Dans la guerre comme dans la paix, le dernier mot est √† ceux qui ne se rendent jamais.\\" (In war as in peace, the last word is theirs that never surrender). In 1943, a section Attentats (attacks) was added to the paper; it contained a list of the paramilitary operations of Combat. The first issue of the Combat newspaper appeared in late 1941 in Lyon, with a press run of 10,000. Andr√© Bollier replaced Martinet, the initial printer for the movement. He distributed the printing across 14 presses in the free zone, thus reducing the need for transporting papers from Lyon, and allowing the run to be increased. In May 1944, the newspaper had a run of 250,000. Bollier was also responsible for printing D√©fense de la France (the future France-Soir), Action (a paper with communist sympathy), the first issues of T√©moignage chr√©tien, and certain issues of the Franc-Tireur paper and La Voix du Nord. = Information = Alongside the underground press activities, information was sent to London by circuitous routes. These operations were directed by Jean Gemahling, from Alsace. The Noyautage des administrations publiques (infiltration of public services) was also established, with the original aim of recruiting public figures who would be able to assure the return of the republic after the Vichy regime fell. However, the NAP gradually changed direction and allowing itself necessary cooperation with public services and the ability to obtain basic information about German army movements. The NAP- police were created, whose members would warn their comrades about forthcoming arrests. Another branch, the NAP-fer led by Ren√© Hardy, provided the Groupes Francs with schedules of German supply trains from 1943. The NAP also operated within the customs service. = The Groupes de Choc = The Groupes de Choc were set up, generally specializing in attacks against collaborators and shopkeepers who sold collaborationist papers like the Nazi magazine Signal (the shops of the latter were generally blown up). From 1942 onwards the GC gradually merged into the Arm√©e secr√®te which was assimilating by degrees the various paramilitary groups of Combat, Lib√©ration and Franc-Tireur. This merging was encouraged by Frenay and Moulin, who wanted the operations of the GC remained separate from any intelligence and propaganda activities. For this reason, the leadership of the Arm√©e Secr√®te was not conferred upon Frenay as he had initially wanted (his movement being more significant than the other two members of the MUR) but rather upon the division general Charles Delestraint, who was recruited by the chef de Combat. The Sabotage and Maquis sections were added to the network in 1943. = Groupes Francs = Frenay put Jacques Renouvin in charge of mounting Groupes Francs, mobile armed squads, in each of the six regions covered by the network. They were organised in the Choc branch of the network. They worked independently of the Arm√©e Secr√®te but in contact with it to organise their operations and provide intelligence. The Groupes Frances organised their operations on their own initiative, following the general framework which was given them. They communicated the results of their operations to the steering committee. Before November 1942, the operations of the Groupes Francs were similar to those of the Groups de Choc. They were responsible for obtaining their own arms from supply dumps or police posts, and making their own explosives or stealing them from mines. After the German invasion of the free zone in November 1942, the Groups Francs changed their operations style. They were ordered to attack trains containing German soldiers or going to Germany, to sabotage railway lines, to destroy arms factories and dumps and to assassinate Gestapo agents. The GF were supplied and armed by Britain through parachute dumps which provided them with Sten guns, pistols, ammunition, explosives, grenades and other equipment. The GF also organised escapes for captured resistance fighters such as that of Paul Reynaud (planned and prepared but never executed) and the successful escape of Berty Albrecht who was being held at the Lyon-Bron psychiatric hospital. In January 1943, Jacques Renouvin, was arrested by the Gestapo getting off a train. He was held in Fresnes prison. A commando raid was mounted to free him but all its members were arrested. Renouvin was deported to Mauthausen concentration camp where he died. He was replaced as head of the GF by a member of Lib√©ration. = The Maquis = In 1943 the steering committee of Combat learned that refugees from the Service du travail obligatoire forced labour had fled to Haute-Savoie and the Maquis had been created in the mountainous massifs. The service Maquis was established in Combat's Military affairs branch with the aim of helping all those who had \\"taken the maquis\\" to survive and to fight, and of providing them lives and armaments, and of integrating them into Combat's network. While the objective for Combat was to develop, oversee and organise these armed groups, there were some divisions relating to this at the heart of the MUR; some, like Charles Delestraint, saw the Maquis as actual pockets of resistance within French territory, whereas others like Frenay saw them as armed bands operating by ambush and disappearing once their mission was accomplished.

It was created on 5 August 1622 for James Dillon, 1st Baron Dillon. He had already been created Baron Dillon on 24 January 1619, also in the Peerage of Ireland. The fourth Earl was a courtier, poet and critic. The fifth Earl was a professional soldier, politician and courtier: he was friendly with Samuel Pepys, who refers to him several times as \\"Colonel Dillon\\" in his famous Diary. After the death of the tenth Earl, there were two prolonged investigations by the Irish House of Lords during the 1790s to ascertain the legitimacy of his son Patrick, against the rival claim by Robert Dillon, a descendant of the seventh son of the first Earl and the next male heir in line. These eventually found in Patrick's favour. The titles became dormant on the death of the eleventh Earl in 1816. However, in 1828 the United Kingdom House of Lords decided that the rightful heir to the peerages was Michael Dillon, another descendant of the seventh son of the first Earl, who became the twelfth Earl. The House of Lords decided against Francis Stephen Dillon (d 1840Longford Journal 30 May 1840), an inmate of a debtors' prison who dubiously claimed descent from the third son of the first Earl. The titles became extinct on the death of the twelfth Earl on 15 May 1850. The Viscounts Dillon and Barons Clonbrock were members of other branches of the Dillon family. They were a long-established Anglo-Norman family who were recorded in Ireland from about 1185, and held substantial lands in Meath, Westmeath, Longford and Roscommon. Sir James Dillon (died 1507), great-grandfather of the first Earl, was a distinguished judge, as were several of his descendants.

Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians seventh edition. London, England: Collier Macmillan Publishers, 1984: 662 was a composer, poet, and playwright,Magill, Frank N., ed. Critical Survey of Drama: Foreign Language Series v2. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Salem Press, 1986. often called the founder, along with Gil Vicente, of Spanish drama. His birth name was Juan de Fermoselle. He spelled his name Enzina, but this is not a significant difference; it is two spellings of the same sound, in a time when \\"correct spelling\\" as we know it barely existed. Life He was born in 1468 near Salamanca, probably at Encina de San Silvestre, one of at least 7 known children of Juan de Fermoselle, a shoemaker, and his wife. He was of Jewish converso descent.See, Norman Roth, \\"Conversos, Inquisition, and the Expulsion of the Jews from Spain\\", Madison, WI: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1995, pp. 157, 176‚Äì178. After leaving Salamanca University sometime in 1492 he became a member of the household of Don Fadrique de Toledo, the second Duke of Alba, although some sources believe that he did not work for the Duke of Alba until 1495.Pope, Isabel; Tess Knighton. Encina, Juan del. Sadie, Stanley, ed. The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians 2nd edition. V8. New York City: Grove‚Äôs Dictionaries Inc., 2001: 194 A plausible argument is that his first post was as a Corregidor in northern Spain. Fermoselle was a Chaplain at the Salamanca Cathedral in the early 1490s. It was here that he changed his name from Juan de Fermoselle to Juan del Enzina, or Encina (meaning holm oak) during his stay as Chaplain. He was later forced to resign as Chaplain because he was not ordained. Works Book cover of his chansonnier's first edition (1496): Cancionero de todas las obras de Juan del Enzina con otras cosas nueuamente a√±adidas In 1492 the poet entertained his patron with a dramatic piece, the Triunfo de la fama, written to commemorate the fall of Granada. In 1496 he published his Cancionero, a collection of dramatic and lyrical poems. He then applied for the cantor post at Salamanca Cathedral, but the position was divided among three singers, including his rival Lucas Fernandez. While working for the Duke of Alba, Encina was the program director, along with Lucas Fernandez. Here Encina wrote pastoral eclogues, the foundation of Spanish secular drama. Encina's plays are predominantly based on shepherds and unrequited love. Encina was ambitious, looking to be promoted based on preferment, so around 1500 he relocated to Rome, where he apparently served in the musical establishments of several cardinals or noblemen. Encina was appointed to the Archdiaconate of Malaga Cathedral by Julius II in 1508. In 1518 he resigned from position at Malaga for a simple benefice at Moron, and the following year he went to Jerusalem, where he sang his first mass. He also wrote about the events during his pilgrimage to Jerusalem in Tribagia o Via Sacra de Hierusalem. In 1509 he had held a lay canonry at M√°laga; in 1519 he was appointed by Leon for the priorship of Leon Cathedral. His last job was recorded as being in Leon, where he is thought to have died towards the end of 1529. His Cancionero is preceded by a prose treatise (Arte de trobar) on the condition of the poetic art in Spain. His fourteen dramatic pieces mark the transition from the purely ecclesiastical to the secular stage. The Aucto del Repel√≥n and the √âgloga de Fileno dramatize the adventures of shepherds; the latter, like Pl√°cida y Vitoriano, is strongly influenced by the Celestina. The intrinsic interest of Encina's plays is slight, but they are important from the historical point of view, for the lay pieces form a new departure, and the devout eclogues prepare the way for the autos of the 17th century. Moreover, Encina's lyrical poems are remarkable for their intense sincerity and devout grace. Even though his works were dedicated to royal families, he never served as a member of a royal chapel. And even though Encina worked in many Cathedrals and was ordained as a priest, no religious musical works are known to still exist. Most of his works were done by his mid-30s, some 60 or more songs attributed to Encina, and another 9 settings of texts on top of that, to which the music could also be added, but not for certain. Many of the surviving pieces are villancicos, of which he was a leading composer. The Spanish villancico is the equivalent of the Italian Frottola. There are three and four voice settings that offer a variety of styles depending on the kind of text, with very limited movements in the voices in preparation for the cadence points. To make the text heard clearly, Encina used varied and flexible rhythms that are patterned on the accents of the verse, and used simple yet strong harmonic progressions. Leonese times Encina held the priorship of Leon Cathedral from November 1523 until his final illness in December 1529. Juan del Encina's will was presented on January 14, 1530, so the exact date of his death is not known, but it is thought to be in late 1529 or early 1530. In his will he noted that he wanted to be buried beneath the choir of Salamanca Cathedral, and in 1534 his remains were taken to the Cathedral. =Leonese language influence= Juan del Encina wrote in Castillian with Leonese language influencesL√≥pez Morales, \\"Elementos leoneses en la lengua del teatro pastoril de los siglos XV y XVI\\". 1967 in his pastoral eclogues. He was from Salamanca, a Leonese-speaking region, and eventually arrived at the capital of the long-vanished Kingdom of Le√≥n, where he died. He was also a songwriter for the church.

He is the third youngest son of Yip Sang, a prominent Chinese merchant and paymaster of CP Railway, in Vancouver in the 1900s. Early years Yip was born in Vancouver in 1906, the 17th of 19 sons, and one of 23 children born to prominent Canadian businessman Yip Wang Sang's four wives. Dock Yip in front of Angell Hall, at the University of Michigan In 1931, Yip graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy from the University of Michigan. After completing his pharmacological studies, Yip returned to Vancouver where he became Secretary for the Chinese Consulate; it was during this period that Yip decided to pursue a career in law. Yip, along with some of his brothers, were members of the Chinese Students Soccer Team in 1933, when they became the B.C. Mainland Cup Soccer Champions. The team is believed to be the only soccer team composed of Chinese players outside of China in that era, a time when Chinese people in B.C. faced heavy racism. In 2011, they were inducted into the B.C. Sports Hall of Fame. In 1941 Yip earned his Bachelor of Arts from the University of British Columbia. Driven by the fact that British Columbia did not allow individuals of Chinese origin to practice law, Yip moved to Toronto with his future wife Victoria Chow upon the completed his studies at UBC. In 1942 Yip became a reservist with The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada. Law practice in Toronto After three attempts to gain admittance into Osgoode Hall Law School, he was admitted and graduated in 1945 with his Bachelor of Laws. Later that year, he became the first lawyer of East Asian descent called to the bar in Canada. Yip, working closely with civil liberties and human rights lawyer and law school friend Irving Himel and other activists from across the country, was an important player in convincing the Government of Canada to, in 1947, repeal the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923, commonly known as the Chinese Exclusion Act, thereby allowing immigration of Chinese people into Canada. He remained focused on this issue, through 1958 to 1966 fighting to have Canada's immigration policies reformed to reduce the barriers Chinese immigrants faced trying to enter Canada. From his work, Yip became an important community leader in Toronto's Chinatown. After achieving victory in his legal fight for Chinese-Canadian rights, Yip returned to his legal career serving Toronto's Chinese community. He maintained a private legal practice in Chinatown where he flourished, due to his fluency in three Chinese languages, the fact he was the only Chinese-speaking attorney in Toronto at the time, and because he was a man who \\"gave personal care and attention to his clients\\". Yip was highly respected by other lawyers, recognized as a person of integrity and role model; he was also fondly remembered as a man with an encyclopedic knowledge, as comfortable discussing classical literature as he was debating intricacies of law. In addition to his 47 years assisting Chinese residents with their legal needs, four decades of that spent working out of store-front offices in Chinatown, Yip served two terms as a Toronto Board of Education trustee for Ward 6 in the 1970s. In 1985, he played the role of tong leader, Milton Bin, in the movie Year of the Dragon starring Mickey Rourke. Then in 1991 he appeared in a Cyndi Lauper rock video. Yip continued to practice law until retiring in 1992. In 1994, at the age of 87, Yip received special recognition from Ryerson University as the oldest student in their continuing education program, studying Shakespearean English by correspondence. In 1998 he was awarded the Law Society Medal by the Law Society of Upper Canada for outstanding service to the legal profession. Personal life In 1942, Yip married Victoria Chow, his childhood sweetheart. They had three children and five grandchildren. Yip's sister, Susanne Yip Gimling, was principal of the Kwangtung Provincial Girls‚Äô Middle School in Guangzhou, China during the 1930s.

The High Line's design is a collaboration between James Corner Field Operations, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and Piet Oudolf. The abandoned spur has been redesigned as a \\"living system\\" drawing from multiple disciplines which include landscape architecture, urban design, and ecology. Since opening in 2009, the High Line has become an icon of contemporary landscape architecture. The park is built on a disused, southern viaduct section of the New York Central Railroad's West Side Line. Originating in the Meatpacking District, the park runs from Gansevoort Street ‚Äì three blocks below 14th Street ‚Äì through Chelsea to the northern edge of the West Side Yard on 34th Street near the Javits Center. The West Side Line formerly extended south to a railroad terminal at Spring Street, just north of Canal Street, and north to 35th Street at the site of the Javits Center. The southern portion of the viaduct was demolished in segments during the late 20th century. Due to a decline in rail traffic along the rest of the viaduct, it was effectively abandoned in 1980 when the construction of the Javits Center required the demolition of the viaduct's northernmost portion. The High Line was inspired by the long Promenade plant√©e (tree-lined walkway), a similar project in Paris completed in 1993. Repurposing the railway into an urban park began in 2006 and opened in phases during 2009, 2011, and 2014. The Spur, an extension of the High Line that originally connected with the Morgan General Mail Facility at Tenth Avenue and 30th Street, opened on June 4, 2019, as the final part of the park to open. The High Line's success has inspired cities throughout the United States to redevelop obsolete infrastructure as public space. The park became a tourist attraction and spurred real estate development in adjacent neighborhoods, increasing real-estate values and prices along the route. By September 2014, the park had nearly five million visitors annually, and by 2019, it had eight million visitors per year.  Description  14th and 15th Streets (where the tracks run through the second floor of the Chelsea Market building), with a side track and pedestrian bridge The park extends for from Gansevoort Street to 34th Street. At 30th Street the elevated tracks turn west around the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on 34th Street, although the northern section is expected to be integrated with the Hudson Yards development and the Hudson Park and Boulevard. When the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project's Western Rail Yard is finished in 2018 it will be elevated above the High Line Park, so an exit along the viaduct over the West Side Yard will lead to the Western Rail Yard. The 34th Street entrance is at grade, with wheelchair access. The park is open daily from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. in winter, until 10 p.m. in spring and fall, and until 11 p.m. in summer (except for the Interim Walkway west of 11th Avenue, which is open until dusk). It can be reached through eleven entrances, five of which are accessible to people with disabilities. The wheelchair-accessible entrances, each with stairs and an elevator, are at Gansevoort, 14th, 16th, 23rd, and 30th Streets. Additional staircase-only entrances are located at 18th, 20th, 26th, and 28th Streets, and 11th Avenue. Street-level access is available at 34th Street via the Interim Walkway, which runs from 30th Street and 11th Avenue to 34th Street west of 11th Avenue. =Route= At the Gansevoort Street end (which runs north-south), the stub over Gansevoort Street is named the Tiffany and Co. Foundation Overlook and was dedicated in July 2012; the foundation was a major supporter of the park. The route then passes under The Standard, High Line hotel and through a passage at 14th Street. At 14th Street, the High Line splits into two sides at different elevations; the Diller-Von Furstenberg Water Feature (opened in 2010) is on the lower side, and a sundeck is on the upper side. The route passes under the Chelsea Market, a food hall, at 15th Street.\\"About Chelsea Market\\", Chelsea Market website . Retrieved September 21, 2014. A spur, connecting the viaduct to the National Biscuit Company building and closed to the public, splits off at 16th Street. The Tenth Avenue Square, an amphitheater on the viaduct, is at 17th Street where the High Line crosses over Tenth Avenue from southeast to northwest. At the 23rd Street Lawn, visitors can rest. Between 25th and 26th Streets a ramp takes visitors above the viaduct, with a scenic overlook facing east at 26th Street. The Philip Falcone and Lisa Maria Falcone Flyover, named after two major donors to the park, was based on plans for a Phase 1 flyover which was never built. The park then curves west to Phase 3 and merges into the Tenth Avenue Spur, which stretches over 30th Street to Tenth Avenue. The Tenth Avenue Spur is composed of three parts: the Coach Passage, with ceilings; the High Line's largest planted garden; and a plaza with temporary art exhibitions that get replaced every 18 months. Phase 3 has another ramp taking visitors above the viaduct at 11th Avenue and a play area with rail ties and the Pershing Beams (modified, silicone-covered beams and stanchions coming out of the structure), a gathering space with benches, and a set of three railroad tracks where one can walk between the rails. The play area also has a seesaw-like bench and a \\"chime bench\\", with keys which make sounds when tapped. The Interim Walkway, from 11th Avenue and 30th Street to 34th Street divides the viaduct into two sides: a gravel walkway and an undeveloped section with rail tracks. The temporary walkway will close for renovation when the Tenth Avenue Spur is completed. The High Line turns north to a point just east of Twelfth Avenue. At 34th Street it curves east and descends, ending at street level midway between 12th and 11th Avenues. = Attractions = The center section, opened in June 2011 Tenth Avenue and 17th Street, where the \\"10th Avenue Square & Overlook\\" provides views of the street from a window placed in the space created by removing the structure's steel beams.\\"Features: 10th Avenue Square & Overlook\\" High Line website The park's attractions include naturalized plantings, inspired by plants which grew on the disused tracks, and views of the city and the Hudson River. The pebble-dash concrete walkways swell and constrict, swing from side to side, and divide into concrete tines which meld the hardscape with plantings embedded in railroad- gravel mulch. \\"By opening the paving, we allow the plants to bleed through,\\" said landscape architect James Corner, \\"almost as if the plants were colonizing the paved areas. There's a sort of blending or bleeding or suturing between the hard paving, the surface for people to stroll on, and the planting ... \\" Stretches of track and ties recall the High Line's former use, and portions of track are re-used for rolling lounges positioned for river views. The 120-species plant palette, curated by Dutch landscape architect Piet Oudolf, includes sturdy meadow plants (such as clump-forming grasses, liatris, and coneflowers) and scattered stands of sumac and smokebush and is not limited to native plants. At the Gansevoort Street end, a grove of mixed species of birch provides shade by late afternoon. Ip√™ timber for the built-in benches came from a managed forest certified by the Forest Stewardship Council to ensure sustainability and the conservation of biological diversity, water resources, and fragile ecosystems. According to James Corner Field Operations, the High Line's design \\"is characterized by an intimate choreography of movement.\\" The High Line also has cultural attractions as part of a long-term plan for the park to host temporary installations and performances. Creative Time, Friends of the High Line, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation commissioned The River That Flows Both Ways by Spencer Finch as the inaugural art installation. The work is integrated into the window bays of the former Nabisco factory loading dock as a series of 700 purple and gray glass panes. Each color is calibrated to match the center pixel of 700 digital pictures (one taken every minute) of the Hudson River, making up an extended portrait of the river. Creative Time worked with Finch to realize his site- specific concept after he saw the rusted, disused mullions of the old factory, with metal-and-glass specialists Jaroff Design helping to prepare and reinstall. A summer 2010 sound installation by Stephen Vitiello was composed from bells heard throughout New York. Lauren Ross, former director of the alternative art space White Columns, was the High Line's first curator. During the construction of the second phase (between 20th and 30th Streets) several artworks were installed, including Sarah Sze's Still Life with Landscape (Model for a Habitat): a steel-and-wood sculpture near 20th and 21st Streets built as a house for fauna such as birds and butterflies. Kim Beck's Space Available was installed on the roofs of three buildings visible from the southern end. Three sculptures, resembling the armature of empty billboards and constructed like theater backdrops, looks three-dimensional from a distance. Also installed during the second phase of construction was Julianne Swartz's Digital Empathy, a work utilizing audio messages at restrooms, elevators, and water fountains. In 2012-13 the Ghanaian born Nigerian artist El Anatsui's large scale sculpture \\"Broken Bridge ll\\" (at the time his largest work to date) fashioned from recycled pressed tin and broken mirrors was positioned on a wall on the west side of the street between West 21st and West 22nd street facing and sidelining the High Line. In 2016 Tony Matelli's controversial sculpture \\"Sleepwalker\\" was exhibited upon the High Line. In 2017 Max Hooper Schneider's aquarium was displayed on the passageway. In 2018 the High Line hosted the British sculptor Phyllida Barlow's first public commission \\"Prop\\" which has been described as a concrete colossus. History =Rail line= Bell Laboratories Building, seen from Washington Street in 1936. Only the track segment underneath the building still exists. In 1847, the City of New York authorized the construction of railroad tracks along Tenth and Eleventh Avenues on Manhattan's West Side. The street-level tracks were used by the New York Central Railroad's freight trains, which shipped commodities such as coal, dairy products, and beef. For safety the railroad hired \\"West Side cowboys\\", men who rode horses and waved flags in front of the trains. However, so many accidents occurred between freight trains and other traffic that the nickname \\"Death Avenue\\" was given to Tenth and Eleventh Avenues. In 1910, one organization estimated that there had been 548 deaths and 1,574 injuries over the years along Eleventh Avenue. Public debate about the hazard began during the early 1900s. In 1929 the city, the state, and New York Central agreed on the West Side Improvement Project, conceived by New York City park commissioner Robert Moses. The project eliminated 105 street- level railroad crossings, added to Riverside Park, and included construction of the West Side Elevated Highway. The plans also included the construction of the St. John's Freight Terminal at Spring Street, which was completed in 1936 and replaced the street-level St. John's Park Terminal in present-day Tribeca. The West Side Improvement cost more than $150 million, worth about $ billion in dollars. The last stretch of street-level track was removed from Eleventh Avenue in 1941. The first train on the High Line viaduct, part of New York Central's West Side Line, ran along the structure in 1933. The elevated structure was dedicated on June 29, 1934, and was the first part of the West Side Improvement Project to be completed. The High Line, which originally ran from 35th Street to St. John's Freight Terminal, was designed to go through the center of blocks rather than over an avenue. As a result, the viaduct's construction necessitated the demolition of 640 buildings. It connected directly to factories and warehouses, allowing trains to load and unload inside buildings. Milk, meat, produce, and raw and manufactured goods could be transported and unloaded without disturbing street traffic. This reduced the load on the Bell Laboratories Building (which has housed the Westbeth Artists Community since 1970)Shockley, Jay. \\"Bell Telephone Laboratories (Westbeth Artists' Housing) Designation Report\\" , New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (October 25, 2011) and the former Nabisco plant in Chelsea Market, which were served from protected sidings in the buildings. The line also passed under the Western Electric complex at Washington Street. Although the section still existed , it is not connected to the developed park. = Abandonment = Abandoned High Line tracks in 2009 (current phase 3 section at 34th Street) Reconstructed tracks at 20th Street, 2010 The growth of interstate trucking during the 1950s led to a drop in rail traffic throughout the U.S. St. John's Freight Terminal was abandoned in 1960, and the southernmost section of the line was demolished in the following decade due to low use. The West Village Apartments were then built on part of the former segment's right of way. The demolished section began at Bank Street and ran down Washington Street to Spring Street (just north of Canal Street). By 1978, the High Line viaduct was used to deliver just two carloads of cargo per week. The viaduct was shut down in 1980, when owner Conrail had to disconnect the viaduct from the rest of the national rail system for a year. The closure was necessitated as a result of the construction of Javits Center at 34th Street, which required that the curve at 35th Street be rebuilt. The last train on the viaduct was a three-car consist carrying frozen turkeys. During the time the viaduct was disconnected, two large customers along the route moved to New Jersey. The curve to the viaduct from 35th Street was demolished during the construction of Javits Center and was replaced by the current curve at 34th Street. The tracks leading to the High Line were reconnected in 1981, but as there were no more customers along the route, the curve at 34th Street was never completed, and the viaduct did not see any further usage. At this point, Conrail still owned the right of way and the tracks. During the mid-1980s, a group of property owners with land under the line lobbied for the demolition of the entire structure. Peter Obletz, a Chelsea resident, activist, and railroad enthusiast, challenged the demolition efforts in court and tried to re-establish rail service on the line. Obletz offered to buy the viaduct for $10 in order to run a small amount of freight trains on the line, and Conrail accepted, mainly because demolition would have cost $5 million. However, this offer was also disputed in court. By 1988, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was negotiating with Conrail for the possibility for using the line's right of way to construct a light rail route. These negotiations did not proceed further, and by the end of the 1980s, it was expected that the High Line would be demolished. As part of the construction of the Empire Connection to Penn Station, which opened in spring 1991, the West Side Line tracks north of 35th Street were routed to the new Empire Connection tunnel to Penn Station. A small section of the High Line in the West Village, from Bank to Gansevoort Streets, was taken apart in 1991 despite objections by preservationists. The remaining riveted-steel elevated structure was unused and in disrepair during the 1990s, but it remained structurally sound. Around this time, it became known to urban explorers and local residents for the tough, drought-tolerant wild grasses, shrubs (such as sumac) and rugged trees which had sprung up in the gravel along the abandoned railway. The administration of mayor Rudy Giuliani planned to demolish the structure. The Interstate Commerce Commission approved plans to demolish the structure in 1992, but demolition was delayed due to disputes between various city government agencies and the railroad companies. Ownership of the viaduct ultimately passed to CSX Transportation in 1999. = Repurposing proposal = A nonprofit organization called Friends of the High Line was formed in October 1999 by Joshua David and Robert Hammond. They advocated its preservation and reuse as public open space, an elevated park or greenway similar to the Promenade Plant√©e in Paris. The organization was initially a small community group advocating the High Line's preservation and transformation when the structure was threatened with demolition during Rudy Giuliani‚Äôs second term as mayor. In 2000, CSX Transportation gave photographer Joel Sternfeld permission to photograph it for a year. Sternfeld's photographs of its meadow-like natural beauty, discussed in an episode of the documentary series Great Museums, were used at public meetings when the subject of saving the High Line was discussed. Mary Boone's art gallery, as well as Martha Stewart and Edward Norton, hosted fundraising benefits for the High Line in 2001 and 2002 respectively. Fashion designer Diane von F√ºrstenberg (who had moved her New York City headquarters to the Meatpacking District in 1997) and her husband, Barry Diller, also organized fundraising events in her studio. In 2003, Friends of the High Line sponsored a design competition that attracted more than 720 participants from 38 countries. Proposals included a sculpture garden, an elongated swimming pool, and a linear amusement park/campground. In July 2003, Edward Norton and Robert Caro hosted a benefit event at Grand Central Terminal, where the submissions for the design contest were exhibited. The same month, a bipartisan group of city officials began petitioning the federal Surface Transportation Board to hand over title to the viaduct for park use. In anticipation of this handover, the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced plans for a High Line park that September. The following year, the New York City government committed $50 million to establish the proposed park. Mayor Bloomberg and City Council speakers Gifford Miller and Christine C. Quinn were among the major supporters. Fundraising for the park raised a total of over $150 million (). The Surface Transportation Board issued a certificate of interim trail use on June 13, 2005, allowing the city to remove most of the line from the national rail system. Ownership officially passed from CSX to the city that November. = Reconstruction and design= On April 10, 2006, Mayor Bloomberg presided over a ceremony to mark the beginning of construction. The park was designed by James Corner's New York-based landscape architecture firm Field Operations and architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro, with garden design by Piet Oudolf of the Netherlands, lighting design from L'Observatoire International, and engineering design by Buro Happold and Robert Silman Associates. New York City Department of City Planning director and city planning commission chair Amanda Burden contributed to the project's development. Major supporters included Philip Falcone,Robin Pogrebin, Philanthropist With a Sense of Timing Raises Her Profile , The New York Times, June 29, 2009. Accessed June 27, 2012 Diane von F√ºrstenberg, Barry Diller, and von F√ºrstenberg's children Alexander and Tatiana. Hotel developer Andre Balazs, owner of the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, built the 337-room Standard Hotel straddling the High Line at West 13th Street. The southernmost section, from Gansevoort Street to 20th Street, opened as a city park on June 8, 2009. The section includes five stairways and elevators at 14th Street and 16th Street. Around the same time, construction of the second section began. A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on June 7, 2011 to open the second section (from 20th Street to 30th Street), with Mayor Michael Bloomberg, New York City Council speaker Christine Quinn, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer and Congressman Jerrold Nadler in attendance. CSX Transportation, owner of the northernmost section from 30th to 34th Streets, agreed in principle to donate the section to the city in 2011; the Related Companies, which owns development rights for the West Side Rail Yards, agreed not to tear down the spur crossing 10th Avenue. Construction on the final section was started in September 2012. The Whitney Museum of American Art opened its new building on Gansevoort Street, next to the base of the High Line, in 2015. A ribbon-cutting ceremony for the High Line's third phase was held on September 20, 2014, followed the next day by the opening of its third section and a procession down the park. The third phase, costing $76 million, was divided into two parts. The first part (costing $75 million) is from the end of phase 2 of the line to its terminus at 34th Street, west of 11th Avenue. The second part, a spur above Tenth Avenue and 30th Street, has room to install artworks curated by the public art program. The spur was scheduled to open by 2018, but was then delayed to April 2019, and later to June 2019. It opened on June 4, 2019, with the installation of a plinth as its initial artwork. It contains entrances to 10 Hudson Yards, built above the spur. The High Line closed temporarily in early 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City; while most parks remained open during the pandemic, the High Line is a linear park with few means to spread out for social distancing measures. The High Line reopened on July 16, 2020, with limited capacity: the section between Gansevoort and 23rd streets were only open to visitors with timed-entry passes, and were only able to walk northbound from Gansevoort Street, with the other access points being for egress only.  Friends of the High Line  The line is maintained by Friends of the High Line, which was founded by Joshua David and Robert Hammond. The organization is credited with saving the structure by rallying public support for the park and convincing Mayor Michael Bloomberg‚Äôs administration in 2002 to support the project by filing a request with the Surface Transportation Board to create a public trail on the site. Friends of the High Line played a role in the line's visual aesthetic, holding a competition in conjunction with the city of New York in 2004 to determine the design team which would lead the project. Since the park's opening in 2009, Friends of the High Line has had an agreement with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation to serve as its primary steward. The organization is responsible for the daily operation and maintenance of the park, with an annual budget of over $5 million. It has an annual operating budget of $11.5 million, in addition to capital construction and management and fundraising expenses. Friends of the High Line has raised more than $150 million in public and private funds toward the construction of the first two sections of the park. Unlike the first two phases, to which the city significantly contributed, Friends of the High Line was responsible for raising funds for phase three (an estimated $35 million). The organization raises over 90 percent of the High Line's annual operating budget from private donations. When the city donated $5 million to the High Line in 2012, there was criticism that most city parks had received less funding that year, especially since Friends of the High Line had raised an extra $85 million that year. The organization has an office on Washington Street, near the park's southern end. It has 80 full-time, year-round employees and about 150 full- time summer employees. Friends of the High Line has been run by president and co-founder Josh David after executive director Jenny Gersten stepped down in 2014. Co-founder Robert Hammond served as executive director until he stepped down in February 2013. Friends of the High Line has a 38-member board of directors consisting of many New York City businesspeople and philanthropists, including Amanda Burden of Bloomberg Associates, Jane Lauder of Est√©e Lauder Companies, Jon Stryker of the Arcus Foundation and Darren Walker of the Ford Foundation. Impact Since its opening, the High Line has become one of the most popular visitors attractions in New York City. By September 2014, the park had nearly five million visitors annually, and in 2019, it had eight million visitors per year. Most of these visits came from tourists; a 2019 study found that tourists made up four-fifths of the High Line's total visitor count. Residents quoted in The New York Times stated that the park has become a \\"tourist-clogged catwalk\\" since it opened, and one critic called a \\"tourist- clogged cattle chute\\". = Gentrification and development = The recycling of the rail line into an urban park and tourist attraction has revitalized Chelsea, which was \\"gritty\\" and in generally poor condition during the late twentieth century. It has also spurred real-estate development in the neighborhoods along the line. According to mayor Bloomberg, by 2009 more than 30 projects were planned or under construction nearby, and by 2016 more than 11 projects were under construction. It has also helped raise the value of properties directly adjacent to the High Line by an average of 10 percent over properties a few blocks away. At least 20 properties abutting the High Line have sold for at least $10 million since the park's opening in 2009, with an apartment in a building directly adjacent to the park selling for an average of $6 million. Apartments located near Phase 1 of the High Line are, on average, more than twice as costly as those between Seventh and Eighth Avenues (two blocks east). In August 2016, the park continued to increase real-estate values along it in an example of the halo effect. The third phase, by 30th Street, in 2015 Residents who have bought apartments next to the High Line adapted to its presence in various ways, but most responses were positive. However, many established businesses in west Chelsea have closed due to loss of their neighborhood customer base or rent increases. Chelsea has significant minority communities, many of whom live in two large public housing developments. In a 2017 interview, Friends of the High Line co-founder Robert Hammond said that he \\"failed\\" the community; the High Line did not fulfill its original purpose of serving the surrounding neighborhood, which had become demographically divided around the park. Due to the High Line's popularity, several museums were proposed or built along its path. The Dia Art Foundation considered (but rejected) a proposal to build a museum at the Gansevoort Street terminus. On that site, the Whitney Museum has built a new home for its collection of American art. The building, designed by Renzo Piano, opened on May 1, 2015. = Crime = Crime has been low in the park. Shortly after the second section opened in 2011, The New York Times reported that there had been no reports of major crimes (such as assault or robbery) since the first phase opened two years earlier. Parks Enforcement Patrols have written summonses for infractions of park rules such as walking dogs or riding bicycles on the walkway at a lower rate than in Central Park. Park advocates attributed this to the visibility of the High Line from surrounding buildings, a feature of urban life espoused by author Jane Jacobs nearly fifty years before. According to Joshua David, \\"Empty parks are dangerous ... Busy parks are much less so. You're virtually never alone on the High Line.\\" In a review of the Highliner restaurant - which has now reverted to its previous name, the Empire Diner - Ariel Levy wrote in The New Yorker that... \\"The new Chelsea that is emerging on weekends as visitors flood the elevated park ... [is] touristy, overpriced, and shiny.\\" =Projects in other cities= The High Line's success in New York City has encouraged leaders in other cities such as Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, who sees it as \\"a symbol and catalyst\\" for gentrifying neighborhoods. Several cities nationwide have plans to renovate railroad infrastructure into parkland, including Philadelphia's Rail Park, Atlanta's Belt Line, and Chicago's Bloomingdale Trail. The High Line has helped pioneer the creation of elevated parks worldwide. In Queens, the Queensway (a proposed aerial rail trail) is being considered for reactivation along the right-of-way of the former Long Island Rail Road Rockaway Beach Branch. Other cities around the world are planning elevated rails-to-trails parks in what a writer has called the \\"High Line effect\\". According to some estimates, it costs substantially less to redevelop an abandoned urban rail line into a linear park than to demolish it. Landscape architect James Corner (who led the High Line's design team) noted that \\"The High Line is not easily replicable in other cities,\\" however, observing that building a \\"cool park\\" requires a \\"framework\\" of neighborhoods around it to succeed. In 2016, Friends of the High Line launched the High Line Network to support similar infrastructure re-use projects being developed in other cities. There are currently 19 projects in the network, including River LA, the Atlanta Beltline, Crissy Field, Dequindre Cut, the Lowline, Klyde Warren Park, the Bentway, Bergen Arches, Destination Crenshaw and the Trinity River Project. In popular culture The line has been depicted in a variety of media before its redevelopment. The 1979 film Manhattan includes a shot of the High Line as director and star Woody Allen speaks the first line: \\"Chapter One. He adored New York City.\\" See also: Director Zbigniew Rybczy≈Ñski shot the music video for Art of Noise's single, \\"Close (to the Edit)\\" on the line in 1984. In 2001 (two years after the formation of the Friends of the High Line), photographer Joel Sternfeld documented the High Line's flora and dilapidation in his book, Walking the High Line. The book also contains essays by writer Adam Gopnik and historian John R. Stilgoe. Sternfeld's work was regularly discussed and exhibited during the 2000s as the rehabilitation project developed. Alan Weisman's 2007 book, The World Without Us, cites the High Line as an example of the reappearance of the wild in an abandoned area. Kinetics & One Love's 2009 song, \\"The High Line\\", uses the line (before its conversion to a park) as an example of nature's reclamation of man-made structures. A number of films and television programs have utilized the High Line since the park opened. In 2011, the television series Louie used it as a setting for one of the title character's dates. Other works with scenes on the High Line since its conversion include the Simpsons episode \\"Moonshine River\\" and the film, What Maisie Knew.

The film was written and directed by Richard Kelly and stars Cameron Diaz and James Marsden as a couple who receive a box from a mysterious man (played by Frank Langella) who offers them one million dollars if they press the button sealed within the dome on top of the box, but tells them that, once the button has been pushed, someone they do not know will die. Plot In December 1976, financially desperate NASA engineer Arthur Lewis and his wife Norma find a package on their doorstep, containing a wooden box with a large red button. The mysterious and disfigured Mr. Steward arrives to deliver the key to unlock the button, and tells Norma that if the button is pushed, she will receive $1 million in cash, but someone she does not know will die. He gives her $100 for allowing him to enter the house and voice his deal, and leaves. Norma and Arthur argue over Steward's offer, complicated by the news that their son Walter's private school, where Norma teaches, will no longer provide a discount for his tuition. They open the box to discover it is 'just a bunch of wood', and Arthur chastises Norma for her fear, but no decision is made before they go to sleep. They discuss the matter further in the morning, and after work, Arthur reveals that the hundred dollar bill is real. After further discussion, Norma impulsively pushes the button, whispering 'It's just a box'. It is revealed that someone is shot, and the gunman ran from the scene with a briefcase. Mr. Steward arrives and presents Arthur and Norma with the $1 million, assuring them that someone did indeed die as a result of their actions, and that the same offer will be presented to someone else they do not know. Arthur attempts to return the money, but Steward declines, stating that he can do nothing because \\"the button has been pressed\\". The police treat the murder as a domestic homicide, and it is discovered that the husband of the woman who was shot is a colleague of Arthur's. NASA chief Martin Teague and Norm Cahill, Arthur's boss, discuss Cahill's missing colleague, Arlington Steward. The chief tells Cahill that Steward became \\"something else\\" after being killed by lightning, shortly after NASA received the first photograph transmitted by the Viking 1 Mars lander in July 1976. Arthur and Norma become plagued by seemingly supernatural happenings, and are visited by others who fell victim to the box, pressing the button and suffering the same fate as the Lewis family. It is revealed that Arlington has been collaborating with a group of benefactors, using the box to decide whether the human race is worth preserving. After several paranormal incursions, Arlington returns to the Lewis home and informs them that Walter, earlier kidnapped by unknown assailants, is locked in the family's bathroom upstairs and has been stricken blind and deaf. Arlington laments that he had hoped the family would not succumb to the temptation of the money, and delivers a final ultimatum: They may keep the money and live out their lives with their disabled son, or Arthur can kill Norma, thereby restoring Walter's sight and hearing, with the million dollars placed in a high-interest account available to him when he turns 18. Arthur contemplates killing Arlington, who warns him he will be charged with the murder, his son's condition will remain, and the family will be left with nothing. Arlington departs, and Arthur realizes the choice to push the button has placed the family in purgatory. Norma, wanting her son to live his life without disability, asks Arthur to kill her, and after a long goodbye, he complies. Another couple is offered the same box. They also decide to press the button, resulting in Norma's death. It is implied that this mysterious offer will continue among other couples in the future. Cast Production Director Richard Kelly wrote a script based on the 1970 short story \\"Button, Button\\" by author Richard Matheson, which had previously been turned into a Twilight Zone episode of the same name. The project had a budget of over $30 million provided by Media Rights Capital. Kelly described his intent for the film, \\"My hope is to make a film that is incredibly suspenseful and broadly commercial, while still retaining my artistic sensibility.\\" Actress Cameron Diaz was cast in the lead role in June 2007. Most of the filming took place in the Boston, Massachusetts area, with scenes shot in downtown Boston, South Boston, Waltham, Ipswich, Winthrop, Milton, Medfield, Quincy, Kingston, and North Andover, as well as other localities. Some filming took place on the Milton Academy campus and at Boston Public Library. A large indoor set was built inside a former Lucent Technologies building in North Andover to recreate a NASA laboratory. The production crew also journeyed to NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, to shoot a number of scenes for the film. Richard Kelly's father had worked at NASA Langley in the 1970s and 80s. Filming also took place in Richmond, Virginia, including overhead shots of the city, including 95 South passing the train station. Many background extras were reused in different scenes, and people with period-correct 60s and 70s cars were encouraged to participate. Arlington Steward's car, in particular, is a Buick Electra, although characters in the movie refer to it as Lincoln Town Car (an entirely different car model, which was not yet in production at the time the movie is set). Actor Frank Langella was cast in October 2007, and production began on the film the following month. Prior to production, actor James Marsden was cast a lead role opposite Diaz. Production concluded by February 2008. It was the second time Marsden and Langella worked together, the first being Superman Returns and re-teaming again in Robot & Frank. =Music= In December 2008, it was announced that Win Butler and Regine Chassagne of Canadian band Arcade Fire, and Owen Pallett provided an original score for the film. Butler, Chassagne, and Pallett helped Kelly during the editing process by advising his decisions. Butler, Chassagne, and Pallett had planned on releasing the soundtrack after Arcade Fire's third album release in August 2010, but as of 2019, the soundtrack is still unavailable. Release The film was first released in Australia on October 29, 2009. While it was originally scheduled to be released in the U.S. on October 30, 2009, on July 31, 2009, it was announced the release date would be delayed to November 6, 2009. The film opened with $7,571,417 in 2,635 theaters at an average of $2,873 per theater. It ranked number 6 at the box office coming in behind the newly released Disney's A Christmas Carol, The Men Who Stare at Goats, and The Fourth Kind. The film went on to gross $15,051,977 domestically and $32,924,206 worldwide. It was released on DVD, Blu-ray and digital download in the U.S. on February 23, 2010. Reception The film received mixed reviews from film critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 44% of 153 critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.1 out of 10. The site's consensus is that \\"Imaginative but often preposterous, The Box features some thrills but largely feels too piecemeal.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from film critics, has a score of 47 based on 24 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore on opening day gave the film an F, for which CinemaScore President Ed Mintz blamed the film's ending and was quoted as saying \\"People really thought this was a stinker.\\" , it is one of only 19 films to receive such a rating. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film three out of four stars, and wrote: \\"This movie kept me involved and intrigued, and for that I'm grateful.\\" Jordan Mintzer of Variety wrote: \\"Kelly's trademark mix of sci-fi, surrealism and suburbia occasionally entertains.\\" Keith Uhlich of Time Out New York named The Box the ninth-best film of 2009, calling it \\"a defiantly personal project that solidifies writer-director Richard Kelly's talent, even as it surely pushes him further toward the filmmaking fringe.\\" Awards The film was nominated at the 8th Visual Effects Society Awards in the category of Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Feature Motion Picture but lost to Sherlock Holmes.

Cary Elwes mentioned on the commentary for the uncut edition DVD of Saw 3D that he passed on the role of Josh. It was shot simultaneously (from February 1991 until July 1991) with its sequel, Critters 4. Unlike the first two films, it does not take place in the town of Grover's Bend. Plot Sometime after the events in Critters 2: The Main Course, Charlie MacFadden is tracking down the last of the Critters. A family of three ‚Äì Annie (the main protagonist), Johnny (her little brother) and Clifford (the father) ‚Äì stops at a rest stop when their car's tire pops. At the rest stop, Charlie warns them and Josh, stepson of a corrupt landlord, about the Critters. As this happens, a Critter lays eggs under the family's car and the family leaves, unknowingly taking the eggs with them. Soon after they arrive at their tenement, the Critters hatch and attack the sleazy maintenance man, Frank. When the landlord arrives, he too is eaten by the Critters after Josh locks him in Clifford's room, unknowingly trapping his stepfather with the creatures. Next, one of the residents is attacked and wounded. Annie, her family and five others (including Josh) try to get to safety in one piece by getting to the roof of the building. Charlie arrives and destroys the remaining Critters, saving the remaining tenants. The film ends in a cliffhanger as Charlie is about to destroy two Critter eggs, but is ordered not to and a containment pod sent from the Intergalactic Council crashes into the basement.

The Whipple observatory complex is located on Mount Hopkins, Arizona, US (55 km south of Tucson) in the Santa Rita Mountains. The observatory is operated by the University of Arizona and the Smithsonian Institution, and has a visitor center in nearby Amado, Arizona. The MMTO is the home of the MMT (formerly Multiple Mirror Telescope), which has a primary mirror 6.5 m in diameter. The name comes from the six smaller mirrors originally used before the single primary mirror was installed in 1998. The primary mirror has a special lightweight honeycomb design made by the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory Mirror Laboratory. The MMT is housed in a building which allows the walls and roof around the telescope to be completely rolled back, allowing it to cool down very quickly in order to improve observation.  Multiple Mirror Telescope (1979-1998)  The MMT in 1981, showing its six primary mirrors The Multiple Mirror Telescope operated between 1979 and 1998 with six honeycombed borosilicate mirrors by Corning, each with a diameter of , which were donated by the NRO after cancellation of the reconnaissance mission KH-10 (codename DORIAN) based on the Manned Orbiting Laboratory. These mirrors were providing the equivalent gathering area of a 4.5-meter telescope, making it the third largest optical telescope in the world at the time of its dedication. It featured ambitious design innovations including its unusual optical design proposed by Aden Meinel, a co-rotating building and an altitude-azimuth mount. With the exception of the Bolshoi Teleskop Azimutalnyi (BTA-6) and William Herschel's 40-foot telescope, major optical telescopes prior to the MMT used equatorial mounts. The MMT heralded a change in telescope design; all major optical telescopes since the MMT have been built with altitude-azimuth mounts. Several technologies pioneered at the MMT contributed to the success of the subsequent generation of large telescopes. These included: high dynamic-range servos for the altitude-azimuth mount; highly accurate pointing that eliminated the need for sky charts; co-alignment and co-phasing of multiple telescopes; improvements to optical performance by attention to the thermal environment of the facility; contributions to vacuum coatings deposition, optics cleaning, and maintenance; and early experiments in co-phased adaptive optics.  MMT (1998-present)  One of the reasons for its original multiple mirror design was the difficulty of casting large mirrors. One solution to this problem was found by Roger Angel of Steward Observatory, of the University of Arizona, who cast mirrors with a honeycomb structure in the interior of a rotating oven. This made it possible to replace the six mirrors with a single 6.5-meter one. The original building and part of the structure could be reused. The new mirror was the first of its size to be cast and polished in the Steward Observatory Mirror Laboratory. The updated MMT, its name no longer an acronym, was rededicated on 20 May 2000. In late 2002, a novel deformable secondary mirror was added to the telescope. While other adaptive optics designs do their corrections with additional mirrors, minimizing the number of warm surfaces in the light path produces better results in infrared wavelengths. The MMT AO system contributed to the design of the Large Binocular Telescope, which achieved record breaking Strehl ratios with its AO system in 2010. From 2004 to 2010, approximately 8% of MMT observing time was made accessible to the entire astronomical community via the US National Science Foundation's Telescope System Instrumentation Program (TSIP), administered by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO).

It was directed by Rupert Harvey. It is the fourth installment in the Critters franchise, filmed simultaneously with part three, from February 1991 until July 1991. Unlike the first three films, this installment takes place not on Earth, but on a future space station. Plot The film begins where the previous film left off, as Charlie McFadden (Don Keith Opper) still in his role as an alien bounty hunter, is about to destroy two Critter eggs. He is suddenly stopped by a hologram message from his alien friend Ug (Terrance Mann), who tells him the eggs are the last two Critters in existence and that it is against an intergalactic law to cause their extinction. Charlie protests that the Critters are too dangerous to keep alive, but he obeys Ug's orders to place the eggs in a preservation capsule that suddenly falls from the sky. As Charlie puts the eggs in the pod, the hatch closes on him and he is launched into space. Over a half-century later, in 2045, the crew of the salvage ship RSS Tesla finds the pod in deep space and bring it aboard. The ship is crewed by the shady and lecherous Captain Rick Buttram (Anders Hove); along with his eccentric engineer Al \\"Albert\\" Bert (Brad Dourif); pilot Fran (Angela Bassett); cargo specialist Bernie (Eric Da Re); and young engineer apprentice Ethan (Paul Whitthorne), who anxiously anticipates seeing his father back on Earth. While Rick and Bernie bully Ethan, Fran and Albert show him more appreciation. After examining the pod, Ethan discovers the emblem of the old Intergalactic Council on the side and questions the legality of claiming it for salvage. After reporting their find, the ship gets a communication from Councilor Tetra (Terrance Mann), of TerraCor, who offers Rick three times the going rate if he brings the pod to a nearby station. Fran, Bernie and Albert encourage Rick to accept the deal, but Ethan disputes going off course as it will delay his trip home. Eventually, the crew decides to go to the station, but find the facility abandoned and barely kept running by a malfunctioning central computer named \\"Angela\\" that will not obey orders unless given the exact opposite instruction. Matters are more problematic when Albert learns the reactor is leaking radiation although he does not anticipate it becoming critical for a month or so. Rick has bigger plans and secretly decides to rip off the others and take the contents of the pod for himself. Eventually, Ethan stumbles upon Rick tampering with the pod, and Rick offers to cut him into his scheme saying his plan will get them back to Earth sooner. When Ethan refuses to abandon the others, Rick knocks him unconscious with a fire extinguisher. Rick manages to open the pod and encounters an excited Charlie who quickly jumps out. Infuriated, Rick refuses to believe Charlie is the only thing in the pod and crawls inside for himself. There, he discovers the freshly hatched baby Critters who quickly attack and kill him. Charlie tries to shoot the Critters with Rick's gun but the critters manage to run off. He then revives Ethan and goes off to pursue the Critters with the confused boy in tow. Eventually, they meet up with the rest of the crew and Charlie explains who he is and how he came to be in the pod. While the crew contemplates his wild story, Bernie departs refusing to believe that \\"man-eating furballs\\" are running loose on the station. Ethan then uses a computer keycard he earlier found outside a research lab to access a report made by Dr. McCormick (Anne Ramsay), who reveals that she was conducting research on various alien organisms for use as a bioweapon. Unfortunately, her creations could not reproduce on their own and she requested finding a suitable organism capable of rapid reproduction. After realizing what has been going on aboard the station, Albert strongly suggests they all leave it immediately. Meanwhile, Bernie sneaks into the station's pharmacy to steal drugs. The Critters sneak up on him and he becomes their next meal. After the others find his remains, Angela announces that the reactor will go critical within hours and starts sealing off sections of the station. Albert realizes the reactor was in far worse shape than he originally thought. The crew are then forced to crawl through tight service tunnels to reach their ship, during which they find a clutch of freshly laid Critter eggs and learn the Critters are breeding. Unknown to the crew, the Critters have made their way to the Tesla and program the ship to head for the nearest inhabited planet ‚Äì Earth. One Critter tells the other to \\"get the kids\\" while it preps the ship for take-off. Once the crew arrive, Albert hands Charlie the only weapon he has; an antique Colt revolver. Charlie wastes no time using it when they encounter the Critters on the ship, but his shots not only kill the Critters, but destroys the flight controls leaving the ship dead in the water. While the crew attempt repairs, Ethan takes the gun to hunt down the last Critter himself. He finds the creature in the science lab using the equipment there to rapidly grow several baby Critters to full size. He then runs back to the ship to warn the others just as a Terracor ship carrying Tetra and his troopers arrives. The surviving crew rush to meet Tetra, but finds the troopers pointing their weapons at them. Tetra demands the Critter eggs but Albert refuses to be threatened. Ethan arrives just as Tetra shoots and kills Albert. Tetra then knocks Fran to the deck while Charlie stands confounded that his old alien friend Ug has turned selfishly evil. Ug says \\"things change\\" and then orders his troops to go find the eggs. Still unnoticed, Ethan runs back to the science lab and sets up a trap for Tetra's troopers. When they arrive he seals them inside with the pack of hungry critters. He then retrieves the Critter eggs from the tunnel and brings them back to Tetra while juggling them carelessly in the air. To Tetra's astonishment, Ethan purposely drops and breaks two of the eggs leaving one left. After Tetra threatens to kill Fran, Ethan tosses the last egg to distract him. Fran then notices the revolver hidden in Ethan's waistband and quickly strikes Tetra in the head with it, knocking him out. Charlie and Fran then rush aboard Tetra's ship to prepare for take-off, but Ethan lingers to mourn over Albert's body. Suddenly, the last Critter appears and attacks him, but Ethan manages to flash freeze the Critter with a fuel hose. As Ethan recovers he finds Tetra pointing a gun at him. Charlie returns and points the revolver at Tetra who doubts that Charlie even has the guts to pull the trigger. Charlie utters, \\"Things change, Ug\\", and shoots Tetra in the head. Angela then warns that the reactor will go critical in a matter of moments and the survivors rush aboard Tetra's ship to escape. As Angela counts down to detonation, the station suddenly explodes a few seconds early leaving Ethan to laugh at how stupid the computer was, and that it could not even correctly tell time. With the critters now extinct, Charlie, Fran and Ethan depart on their continuing voyage to Earth and Charlie contemplates on how the future will look bright for him.

Rider and Company) I Was Monty's Double (released in the US as The Counterfeit General MontgomeryAbeBooks: \\"The Counterfeit General Montgomery\\" - James, M. E. Clifton Retrieved 2012-01-15) is a book by M. E. Clifton James, first published in London in 1954. It was made into a film in 1958, directed by John Guillermin, from a screenplay adapted by Bryan Forbes. It tells the story of Operation Copperhead: James had an uncanny resemblance to General Montgomery in real life, and he was used to impersonate Montgomery to confuse the Germans during the Second World War. Film vs book The film broadly follows the account by James in his book of the same name, but according to James, there was no attempt to kidnap him. The German High Command did plan to have him killed, but Hitler vetoed the plan until he could be sure where the landings would actually take place. Gibraltar was in reality a hotbed of German agents, and James/Montgomery was spied on by several operatives who were smuggled into Gibraltar specifically to discover what \\"Monty\\" was up to. James/Montgomery deliberately talked nonsense about non-existent operations and plans, in the hope that the spies would overhear and take such information seriously. Satires * The Goon Show broadcast a parody episode entitled I Was Monty's Treble on 10 November 1958 (9th series, show 2). * In 1959, Cecil Parker and Leslie Phillips appeared in a spoof version, The Night We Dropped a Clanger (known as Make Mine a Double in the U.S.), alongside Brian Rix. * The 1961 film On the Double, starring Danny Kaye, was also a take-off of I Was Monty's Double, in which Kaye plays the twin roles of the General and the private who (comically but successfully) impersonates him. * The 1989 Jason Connery film Casablanca Express freely borrows from the original tale, but with Churchill as the kidnap target. Glenn Ford appears briefly as a character resembling Gen. Williams. * British satirical magazine Private Eye carried a spoof version of the War Picture Library graphic novels entitled \\"Battle for Britain\\", a satire on then-current British political issues, most notably the miners' strike. The author was credited as \\"Monty Stubble\\", a pun on Monty's Double. Since 2010, the name 'Monty's Double' has been adopted by the actor Colin Brooks-Williams as the identity for his popular Field-Marshal Montgomery lookalike and impersonation act, with which he tours 1940s-themed events nationwide ; as a tribute to the Field-Marshal himself and to M.E.Clifton James (the original war-time 'Monty's Double'). Colin has registered the name 'Monty's Double' as his professional stage name with the actor's union 'Equity' and carries the name on his Equity membership card. References *James, M. E.

D. Beresford. It is one of the first novels to involve a wunderkind. The child in it, Victor Stott, is the son of a famous cricket player. This origin is perhaps a reference to H.G. Wells's father Joseph Wells. The novel concerns his progress from infant to almost preternaturally brilliant child. Victor Stott is subtly deformed to allow for his powerful brain. One prominent, and unpleasant, character is the local minister. As Beresford's father was a minister, and Beresford was himself partially disabled, some see autobiographical aspects to the story. However this is unproven. What is more concrete is that the story of Christian Heinrich Heineken was an inspiration for the story. Whether the biography of that child prodigy was accurate or not, \\"the Lubeck prodigy\\" is mentioned in the work. In the original version, the progressionist ideas of Henri Bergson on evolution were a significant influence. References Sources * George M. Johnson. J.D. Beresford.

Location MetroTech Center lies between Flatbush Avenue Extension and Jay Street, north of the Fulton Street Mall and south of Tillary Street, close to Brooklyn's Civic Center (Borough Hall and the courts) and Brooklyn Heights. The center is above the Jay Street‚ÄìMetroTech station of the New York City Subway, served by the . It is the nation's largest urban academic-industrial research park. The early occupants included JPMorgan Chase, the New York City Fire Department, the New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, Verizon Human Resources, Keyspan Energy (now National Grid), Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, the New York City College of Technology and the New York University Tandon School of Engineering. Later tenants include MakerBot Industries, the Brooklyn Nets, Slate magazine, the Ms. Foundation for Women, El Diario La Prensa, Robert Half International, and UniWorld Group. The NYU Tandon School of Engineering, previously named Polytechnic Institute, and later Polytechnic University, was one of MetroTech's founding institutions. The Marriott Hotel at Brooklyn Bridge is located across Jay Street. The MetroTech Business Improvement District, a non-profit organization, provides sanitation, marketing, and events programming services. History Former church at east end of plaza, now part of NYU The 1980s and 1990s were a period of major large-scale development activity and renewal in Downtown Brooklyn. The MetroTech Center office complex was at the center of this revitalization and within walking distance of several other major development projects including Pierrepont Plaza, the Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge, Atlantic Terminal Mall, and Renaissance Plaza. MetroTech was controversial when it was created because it involved the demolition of over 100 homes and 50 businesses. As part of an effort to resuscitate Downtown Brooklyn in the 1970s, George Bugliarello, a professor at Polytechnic Institute located in the area, had advanced an idea to create a center for research and development along the lines of the development then starting in Silicon Valley in California. About a decade later the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, like several other scientific and engineering organizations, was unsuccessfully seeking locations for expansion in Manhattan matching their needs and budget. When the AIAA chose to relocate to Washington D.C. due to lack of suitable space in New York, Bugliarello, who had by then become the President of Polytechnic, decided to try again to put his idea of a technology-centered development in Brooklyn into action. A few years later, New York City agreed to designate what had then become Polytechnic University as the main sponsor of the urban renewal project that would become MetroTech, under the condition that there would be at least two other tenants. The city and Polytechnic chose Forest City Enterprises as the project‚Äôs main developer based on its years of experience, commitment to stay in the area, and financial capacity. Forest City's co-founder Bruce Ratner and Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden put together a public-private partnership and quickly redefined the MetroTech vision from a research and development park to a campus-centered back office complex. As Forest City negotiated with Morgan Stanley, two other major corporate players were being wooed for the site: the Securities Industry Automation Corporation (SIAC) and Brooklyn Union Gas. The key to SIAC's decision to move to Metrotech was that the site was on a separate power grid from Manhattan's, which meant their operations would be safe if Manhattan experienced a power failure, as had happened in the New York City blackout of 1977. The move that sealed the decision to build the MetroTech vision begun by Bugliarello was convincing Chase Manhattan Bank to relocate its back office operations there. MetroTech Center was formed in 1992 by making a rectangle of downtown Brooklyn into a superblock (bounded by Jay Street, Johnson Street, Flatbush Avenue, and Myrtle Avenue), to allow the erection of new office buildings and parking garages. Dozens of older buildings had to be demolished in order to clear this space for the construction of the new center. The entire area was designated a pedestrian zone, and, as a consequence, the north ends of Lawrence and Duffield Streets were closed to automobile traffic. From 2000 to 2016, the MetroTech complex generated more than $1 billion in new investment, representing more than five million square feet of new space. In 2017, New York University announced that it would invest over $500 million in its Brooklyn Campus that mainly includes the NYU Tandon School of Engineering and Center for Urban Science and Progress. MetroTech Commons MetroTech Commons, the privately owned public space at the heart of the MetroTech complex, hosts events including concerts, health fairs, chess tournaments and holiday celebrations. Bounded by Lawrence and Duffield Streets, the square is frequently adorned by modern art exhibits. Two pieces called Alligator and Visionary are part of the Commons' permanent public art collection by the well-known sculptor Tom Otterness.

Hodj 'n' Podj was originally designed for Media Vision but it divested all of its multimedia interests following a securities- fraud scandal and the title was purchased by Virgin Interactive. The Space Bar was originally to be published by Rocket Science Games (RSG) but SegaSoft bought out RSG and became the game's publisher. History In late 1993, designer Steve Meretzky began to consider founding an independent game development studio with his friends Mike Dornbrook and Leo DaCosta. The three of them had gone to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology together, and Meretzky had worked with Dornbrook at Infocom and with DaCosta during the 1990s. Following the 1989 closure of Infocom, Meretzky worked on a contractual basis for companies such as Legend Entertainment. However, Meretzky later called this period of remote work \\"creatively unsatisfying\\" and sometimes \\"frustrating\\". He preferred to work on location with a team, and he decided that he no longer wanted \\"to design games for someone else thousands of miles away.\\" The involvement of Dornbrook, a business school graduate, made the idea of an independent company more viable. According to Meretzky, the final impetus for the project came when Dornbrook read an article about Media Vision's new game division, founded in mid-1993 under record label executive Stan Cornyn. As Cornyn was an acquaintance of Dornbrook's, Dornbrook was able to secure a New York meeting with the executive's second-in-command, Linda Rich.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1914 to 1920 as a member of the Manitoba Liberal Party, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Tobias Norris. He later served in the House of Commons of Canada from 1921 to 1925, as a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. In 1936, Hudson was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Hudson was born in Pembroke, Ontario, the son of Albert Hudson and Elizabeth Blellock, and was educated in Portage la Prairie and Winnipeg. He received a law degree from the University of Manitoba in 1898 and was called to the Manitoba bar the next year. He founded the firm of Hudson, Ormond & Marlatt, with which he practised law for thirty-one years. In 1914, he was named King's Counsel. Hudson married Mary R. Russell in 1908. In religion, Hudson was a Presbyterian. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1914, defeating incumbent Conservative Lendrum McMeans by 998 votes in the Winnipeg South \\"A\\" constituency. The Conservatives won this election, and Hudson sat with his party on the opposition benches. The Conservative administration of Rodmond Roblin was forced to resign from office in 1915 amid a corruption scandal, and the Liberals were called on to form a new government. Norris was sworn in as Premier of Manitoba on May 15, 1915, and named Hudson as his Attorney-General and Minister of Telephones and Telegraphs. A new election was called, which the Liberals won in a landslide. Hudson was easily returned in Winnipeg South \\"A\\", and held both of his cabinet portfolios until resigning from office November 10, 1917. According to a Winnipeg Free Press report, Hudson had wanted to resign for several months to better oversee his personal business. He served as a backbencher for the remainder of legislative sitting, and did not seek re-election in the 1920 campaign. Hudson then moved to national politics, seeking election to the Canadian House of Commons in the 1921 federal election. He defeated Conservative George Nelson Jackson by 2,866 votes to win the Winnipeg South riding, and served as a backbench supporter of William Lyon Mackenzie King's government for the next four years. He did not seek re-election in the 1925 campaign. On March 24, 1936, Hudson was appointed a Puisne Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. He held this position until his death in 1947.

Its work included internal training films, travelogues (extolling the virtues of places that could be visited via the British transport system ‚Äì mostly by rail), and \\"industrial films\\" (as they were called) promoting the progress of Britain's railway network. It was headed by Edgar Anstey until 1974, and from then until its demise by John W. Shepherd. Initially, it made films mostly for the British Transport Commission, but after that organisation was broken up in 1963 the majority of its films were for the British Railways Board. However it also made films for London Transport, the British Waterways Board, the travel company Thomas Cook & Son and the coach company Thomas Tilling. Output Many of the unit's films celebrated the running of Britain's nationalised railway network; early titles such as Train Time,Train Time (1952) British Transport Films by Railroad Classics on YouTube Elizabethan Express and Snowdrift at Bleath Gill aimed to document and celebrate the achievements and hard work of railway staff and their machinery.BFI Screenonline Others documented a particular aspect of running a railway, for example running a station as seen in This is York and later Terminus.

In September 1981 BTF's film library closed, with the material being offered back to its retrospective owners. BTF ceased to exist as a full unit in 1982, although the BTF name was still used for various British Rail internal works, many of them by then made on video, until around 1986.

In 1996 the British Railways Board was broken up and the BR films ‚Äì the bulk of the BTF archive ‚Äì were acquired by the British Film Institute. Archives and legacy  In the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s many of the films were released on video, latterly mainly by the British Film Institute (BFI) and by Beulah, which evolved out of FAME and owns the release rights to the BTF films made for London Transport. The British Waterways Board has also released its own library of BTF films on video, and these have latterly appeared on DVD. In recent years several have been released on DVD, with a number of films made for London Transport appearing on Beulah DVDs before the first BFI DVD compilation of BTF films appeared, after many delays, in June 2005. Ten two- disc compilations of BTF films have now been released by the BFI (as of October 2012).

It is similar to the original temple of Confucius in his hometown Qufu and to the Beijing temple, but on a smaller scale. The temple is located on Wenmiao Road () in Huangpu District. The Wenmiao Market lies around it. The market opens every Sunday morning and hosts a temple fair. Shanghai Confucian Temple History The Confucian Temple was first founded during the Yuan Dynasty, when Shanghai, once a small fishing village, was elevated to the status of a county seat. It was also the most prestigious learning institution of the county, as in ancient times a Confucian Temple was typically a combination of temple and school. In the following centuries, it was rebuilt several times. From 1851 to 1855, the temple was occupied by the Small Swords Society and became their headquarters. The temple was almost completely destroyed during the battle when government troops retook control of it. The government eventually decided to rebuild the temple at the present site. The temple was badly damaged during the Cultural Revolution, but in 1995 it was designated for renovation by the local government. Now it is the site of one of the biggest book markets in Shanghai.

In contrast to its Chinese name, which means green hill, Castle Peak is notorious for its severe loss of vegetation and weathering of its granite surface. The area to the west of the hill is an industrial area with several power plants owned by CLP (Castle Peak Power Station and Black Point Power Station). It is also the old name of Tuen Mun during early British rule before starting development of Tuen Mun New Town. In early proposal of the development, the new town was named Castle Peak New Town. Castle Peak Hinterland Castle Peak Hinterland viewed from the summit of Castle Peak Most areas north of the mountain and west of the mountain are commonly known as the Castle Peak Hinterland. Much of this large rocky Hinterland is a designated firing range used by the People's Liberation Army and police forces in Hong Kong, and is named the \\"Tsing Shan Firing Range\\". Warnings are issued to the public before live military exercises are carried out. Sometimes the Fire Range is open to the public, but before venturing into the Hinterland, it is best to confirm the days on which the Hinterland is open to the public by searching for \\"fire range\\" in the Hong Kong Government press release website. The press releases concerning the fire range for any given month is typically released one week prior to the start of that month. Generally speaking, Sundays and Public Holidays are open days. There are many hills that are considered sub-peaks of Castle Peak within this Hinterland. Mountains Kon Shan and Por Lo Shan are frequently visited by hikers because the area's terrain has been compared to that of the Grand Canyon in the US, but in a smaller scale. Note that while the summit of Castle Peak is not part of the Hinterland and is accessible daily, some of the routes leading up to the summit, namely from the north and west, may be closed because of military exercises on select days. Castle Peak is unique in that it is among the few prominent mountains in Hong Kong which are not inside a Country Park. History The name Pui To Shan was associated with a Buddhist monk Pui To Sim Shi (). In Cantonese, Pui means \\"cup\\", To means \\"water- crossing\\", Sim Shi means \\"Monk of Zen\\". Legend has it that the monk had travelled over water in a cup and finally reached the Castle Peak. He established a monastery on the hill, which became the present-day Tsing Shan Monastery. Early records have indicated that the peak was an island once named Tuen Mun Island (). Its former channel with Kau Keng Shan of an important sea route in South China.

It is used in card illusions, and as a method of card sharp. The deck is typically held in a modified mechanic's grip in the dealer's non-dominant hand. The dealer slides the top card partially off the deck as if to deal it, while the dominant hand instead takes hold of the bottom card. The card is snapped away from the deck while the top card is reset. Unless the dealer is particularly skilled at bottom dealing, the technique produces a slightly different sound from standard dealing, and the second-to-bottom card may be drawn slightly out of place.

E. G. (2011). \\"A giant Ordovician anomalocaridid\\". Nature 473 (7348): 510‚Äì513. doi:10.1038/nature09920. edit The name of Dinocaridids comes from Greek, \\"deinos\\" and \\"caris\\", meaning \\"terror shrimp\\" or \\"terror crab\\", due to their crustacean-like appearance and the hypotheses suggesting that members of this class were amongst the dominating and most diverse apex predators of their time.Earth‚Äôs First Diverse Marine Predators Produced Killer Babies Dinocaridids occasionally referred as 'AOPK group' by some literatures, as the group compose of Radiodonta (Anomalocaris and relatives), Opabinia, Pambdelurion and Kerygmachela. It is probably paraphyletic, with Kerygmachela and Pambdelurion more basal than the Opabinia and Radiodonta clade. Anatomy Dinocaridids were bilaterally symmetrical, with a mostly non- mineralized cuticle and a body divided into two major groupings of tagmata (body-sections): head and trunk. The head comprised only one segment (ocular somite) and had two specialized frontal appendages just in front of the mouth and eyes. The frontal appendages are either lobopodous (in gilled lobopodians) or arthropodized (in Radiodonta) and usually paired, but highly fused into a nozzle-like structure in Opabinia. Based on their preocular position and protocerebral origin, the frontal appendages are most likely homologous to the labrum of euarthropods and primary antennae of onychophora. The trunk possessed multiple segments, each with its own gill branch and swimming flaps (lobes). It is thought that these flaps moved in an up-and-down motion, in order to propel the animal forward in a fashion similar to the cuttlefish. In gilled lobopodian genera, the trunk may have borne a lobopodous limb (lobopod) underneath each of the flaps. The midgut of dinocaridids had paired digestive glands similar to those of siberiid lobopodians and cambrian euarthropods. Based on the neuroanatomical evidence from Kerygmachela and Lyrarapax, the dinocaridid brain comprised only a protocerebrum, with frontal appendage nerves and optic nerves connected to its anterior and lateral region respectively.  Classification  Although some authors may rather suggest a different taxonomic affinities (e.g. as cycloneuralian relatives), most of the phylogenetic studies suggest that dinocaridids are stem group arthropods. Under this scenario, Dinocaridida is a paraphyletic grade in correspond to the arthropod crown group (Euarthropoda or Deuteropoda) and also suggest a lobopodian origin of the arthropod lineage. In general, the gilled lobopodian genera Pambdelurion and Kerygmachela which have lobopodian traits (e.g. lobopodous appendage, annulation) occupied the basal position; while Opabinia and Radiodonta are more derived and closely related to the arthropod crown group, with the latter even have significant arthropod affinities such as arthropodization and head sclerites. Only one order, Radiodonta, had been founded for Dinocaridida. Traditionally, Radiodonta included all dinocaridid taxa and all radiodonts were grouped under a single family: Anomalocarididae (hence the previous common name 'Anomalocaridids'). In later studies, Opabinia, Pambdelurion and Kerygmachela were excluded from Radiodonta, and many radiodonts were reassigned to other new families (Amplectobeluidae, Tamisiocarididae and Hurdiidae).  Distribution  The group was geographically widespread, and has been reported from Cambrian strata in Canada, China and Russia, as well as the Ordovician of Morocco and Devonian of Germany.

The Neocatechumenal Way, also known as the Neocatechumenate, NCW, colloquially The Way, is an itinerary of Christian formation within the Catholic Church.Statute of the Neocatechumenal Way, Title I, Art. 1. It was formed in Madrid in 1964 by Kiko Arg√ºello and Carmen Hern√°ndez.(primary source) Taking its inspiration from the catechumenate of the early Catholic Church by which converts from paganism were prepared for baptism, it provides post-baptismal formation to adults who are already members of the Church or to those far from the Church who have been attracted by the testimony of Christian life of love and unity in the communities (referencing such Bible verses as and ),The term post-baptismal catechumenate is also used in the ¬ß1231 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, related to the teaching of the Catechism of the Catholic Church itself, ‚ÄúBy its very nature infant Baptism requires a post-baptismal catechumenate.‚Äù in accordance with the designs of the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults (RCIA).Statute of the Neocatechumenal Way, 2008, p. 2. Due to numerous vocations coming from the families formed in the communities, it has also helped to establish and run over 100 missionary diocesan seminaries in various locations. They are called \\"Redemptoris Mater\\" seminaries. It is responsible for communities of \\"families in mission\\", called \\"Missio ad gentes\\", living in many cities around the world. Together with a priest and his socius, and some celibate women, they make present the Church in places of little or no Catholic presence. The Neocatechumenate, as an itinerary of Christian initiation, is implemented in small, parish-based communities of up to 50 people. In 2007 there were around 20,000 such communities throughout the World, with an estimated million Catholics following the itinerary.Kiko Arg√ºello meets with Benedict XVI (27 May 2007).  Early history  In the early 1960s, Francisco \\"Kiko\\" Arg√ºello moved to the shanty town of 'Palomeras Altas' in Vallecas, Madrid, and gathered a community of Gipsies and marginalised poor.Anuth, B. S. (2006). Der Neokatechumenale Weg. Geschichte, Erscheinungsbild, Rechtscharakter. Echter, W√ºrzburg. He was soon joined by Carmen Hern√°ndez, who linked the community to the theological and liturgical zeitgeist surrounding the Second Vatican Council, and won the support of the archbishop of Madrid , who had been a relator during sessions of the Council.Michael Hayes, New Religious Movements in the Catholic Church 12 (2006)(Carmen Hern√°ndez speech says Morcillo visited the slums (in Italian) June 28, 2002) (primary source). Gradually, the community's approach was codified in a \\"catechetical synthesis\\" referred to as the \\"tripod,\\" \\"Word of God-Liturgy-Community\\", with the stated aim of seeking to lead people to fraternal communion and mature faith. The movement spread through the Archdiocese of Madrid and to other Spanish dioceses. In 1968, it began to spread beyond Spain when Arg√ºello and Hern√°ndez arrived in Rome and settled in the Borghetto Latino. Leadership and governance The community of Neocatechumens was led by the \\"International Responsible Team of the Way\\": Arg√ºello, Hern√°ndez, and Fr. Mario Pezzi, a priest of the Diocese of Rome, until Hern√°ndez's death, in 2016. Under the terms of the 2007 statute, the three members of this leadership team will remain in place for life, after which an electoral college of senior neocatechumenal catechists will elect a new team which, with the approval of the Pontifical Council for the Laity, will have a mandate to lead the Way for a period of seven years until new elections are held.Statute of the Neocatechumenal Way, Title VI, Art. 34-35.

In the Second Scrutiny the great phases of the history of salvation: Abraham, Exodus, Desert, Promised Land, etc., and a time is given to them so that they may prove to themselves the sincerity of their intention to follow Jesus Christ. The local ordinary often presides over the rites of the Neocatechumenal Way. The Neocatechumenal Way has encountered resistance and criticism from both clergy and theologians. In 1995, Gordon Urquhart, known for his cooperation with Catholics for a Free Choice Foundation, accused the Way and other lay movements, like Focolare and Communion and Liberation, of conservatism, fanaticism, sectarianism, devaluing of reason, \\"brainwashing\\", and a \\"personality cult\\" of the founders. In his publication he wrote that after the Neocatechumenate was introduced into the parish of St Germain-des-Pr√©s in Paris, the Archbishop of Paris, Fran√ßois Cardinal Marty, blocked any further expansion before his retirement in 1981, and similar controversy in 1992 prompted the Bishop of Nancy to transfer the neocatechumens to a different church.Michael McGrade, \\"The Last Trojan Horse\\", Christian Order, October 2002 Daniel Lifschitz criticizes an excess of centrality of the Way on the initiators' charism and aesthetics, although not totally rejecting the validity of the movement.Lifschitz, Daniel (2017). Kiko, ti voglio parlare... Udine, Edizioni Segno. . In 1985, then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, in the Rapporto Sulla Fede, spoke of new lay movements, including the Way. The future Pope remarked that they also entail greater or lesser dangers, but that it \\"happens with all living beings,\\" while enumerating the fruits born in these charisms: enabling youth to live their faith fully, a great missionary √©lan, serious life of prayer, full and undivided catholicity, and numerous vocations to priesthood and consecrated life.Ratzinger, Joseph; Messori, Vittorio (1985). The Ratzinger Report: An Exclusive Interview on the State of the Church. San Francisco: Ignatius Press. . There have been allegations that the Way has a divisive impact on parishes. In 1996, Mervyn Alexander, Bishop of Clifton, in England, established a panel of inquiry to explore claims made by parishioners in three parishes (St Nicholas of Tolentino in Bristol, St Peter in Gloucester and Sacred Heart at Chariton Kings in Cheltenham) that had been harmed and experienced ‚Äòconsiderable stress‚Äô as well as ‚Äòspiritual, personal and mental anguish‚Äô by activities of the Neocatechumenal Way. The report stated that \\"it understands, from this presentation paper and the submitted evidence, that the Neocatechumenal Way over a long time (20 years) seeks to lead people towards salvation,\\" but it is a cause of 'considerable stress', and 'spiritual, personal and mental anguish' for some individual members. The report recognized at the same time that \\"there is undoubtedly a 'conversion experience,'\\" and that it is drawing people in different conditions towards God.Report into the presence and activities of the NeoCatechumenal Way in the Diocese of Clifton. 1 November 1996 (‚ÄòClifton Report‚Äô). Commissioned by the Bishop of the Diocese, Mervyn Alexander In some places such as China and the Middle East, local Catholics have complained that missionaries of the Way have forced European songs, rituals and prayers on them, without inculturation.

On 10 January 2009, Benedict XVI met with over 10,000 people for a celebration marking the 40th anniversary of the Neocatechumenal Way in Rome. From this celebration several whole communities were sent on mission, along with itinerant catechists, mission families, and the Missio Ad Gentes (a newer form of mission that sends three to five families to a particular area at the request of the bishop). =The World Youth Days= Approximately every three years, the World Youth Day has been organized by the Roman Catholic Church, during which the Pope summons youths from all over the world to a chosen city. The Way has been an active supporter of these. During the event, young members of the Neocatechumenal Way meet with Arg√ºello for a \\"vocational call.\\" In Sydney, for example, approximately 1,500 men answered the call for the priesthood and 850 young women stood up to show their willingness to enter the consecrated life, and in Bonn (2005) around 1,500 young men and another 900 young women answered the call. These young men and women begin a process of discernment in their own dioceses and communities, which may lead to priesthood (most of the priestly vocations go to a \\"Redemptoris Mater\\" seminary) or consecrated life.Neocatechumenal Meeting Attracts 90,000 (Zenit News Agency). =The Neocatechumenal Way in the Eastern Rites and the Holy Land= During the Neocatechumenal Way vocational meeting held near the Sea of Galilee following Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the Holy Land in May 2009, Arguello described the Way's situation in the Holy Land. There are seven communities in the Latin Church, in Jaffa, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Nazareth, Bethlehem and Cana. In March 2000, the Way opened its Domus Galilaeae formation center on the slopes of the Mount of Beatitudes in Israel. The facility is used for studies and retreat, Christian seminars and conventions. In February 2007, bishops of the Holy Land addressed a letter in which they ask to the Neocatechumenal Way \\"to take place in the heart of the parish in which you announce the Word of God, avoiding to form a separated group\\", to root believers \\"in the parishes and in the liturgical traditions in which they have lived for generations\\", and that all Eucharistic celebrations would be presided by the parish priest. The document stated that the liturgical rite has preserved the Christian faith through the history of their nations and it was \\"like an identity card, not just a way like another to pray\\" in the Church. In June 2007, Melkite archbishop Elias Chacour proposed the establishment of a new \\"branch\\" of the Neocatechumenal Way for the Eastern Catholic Churches, Archbp. Chacour stated in his message that he searched for \\"someone or some community to preach the Good News to my parishioners\\" as an answer to proselytism of the sects, and that the Neocatechumenal Way is an answer. A spokesman for the Way reported the letter to ZENIT, saying that \\"We share the sense of urgency expressed by Archbishop Chacour to evangelize 'the living stones' in the land of the Lord.\\"Melkite Leader Invites Neocatechumenal Way (Zenit).The seal of Redemptoris Mater seminaries =The Redemptoris Mater Seminaries= The Way also operates several seminaries dubbed Redemptoris Mater seminaries which combines the priestly formation found in a seminary with the Christian formation received in a neocatechumenal community. Potential candidates often undergo a time of \\"Pre-Vocational Formation\\" before entering the seminary, which operates somewhat in the manner of a pre-med course, designed to prepare and awaken their vocations. The intent was to establish a seminary that was both international, i.e. with vocations coming from different nations, and missionary, i.e. upon ordination, the priests are available to go wherever their ordinary sends them,(cfr. chapter 10 of Presbyterorum Ordinis) In 1988, the first Redemptoris Mater Seminary was established in Rome by Ugo Cardinal Poletti.Michael Mullaney, Incardination and the universal dimension of the priestly ministry 216 n.259 (2002). The Statutes and the Catechetical Directory In 1997 Pope John Paul II \\"encouraged [Arg√ºello and Hern√°ndez] to examine their thirty-year experience of the Way, and to formalize it with a written statute,\\"Brendan Leahy, Ecclesial Movements and Communities 68 (2011). and Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger urged the drafting of the Statutes as \\"a very important step that will open the way to the formal juridical recognition by the Church, and giving you a further guarantee of the authenticity of your charism\\" (citing Address to the Neocatechumenal Way, 25 January 1997, p. 4; ORE, 5 February 1997, p.9) (primary source) The Statutes drafted in response were approved ad experimentum for five years in 2002,Decree of the Pontifical Council for the Laity: Approval of the Statutes of the Neocatechumenal \\"ad experimentum\\", 2002. Note: During the process, Card. Ratzinger was elected Pope, and at a Q&A; section in February 2007, responded to a question of how pastors should integrate movements in order to develop a real ministry of unity in the universal Church by talking about the Way: > \\"For example, we ask ourselves whether, after five years of experience, it > is possible to confirm definitively the Statutes for the Neocatechumenal > Way, whether a trial period is necessary or whether, perhaps, certain > elements of this structure need perfecting. In any case, I knew the > Neocatechumenals from the very outset. It was a long Way, with many > complications that still exist today, but we have found an ecclesial form > that has already vastly improved the relationship between the Pastor and the > Way. We are going ahead like this! The same can be said for other > Movements.\\" Lenten meeting with the clergy of Rome: Address of his Holiness Benedict XVI and on June 13, 2008, Stanislaw Cardinal Rylko published a decree containing the definitive approval of the statutes of the Neocatechumenal Way.Multiple sources report this: The Statutes describe the nature of the Way and regulate its charism and specific tasks within the Church. (primary source) Through them the Neocatechumenal Way was endowed with \\"public juridical personality\\" status. The Way is thus closely governed by an ecclesiastical authority, performs entrusted functions \\"in the name of the church,\\" and has no material goods of its own.Statutes of the Neocatechumenal Way Title 1 Art. 4 (primary source). After thorough examination by various Vatican dicasteries, on December 26, 2010, the Pontifical Council for the Laity approved the text of the catecheses which are handed on to neo-catechumens during their itinerary. (primary source)Neocatechumenal Way receives Vatican approval for its teachings, instructions from Pope (EWTN)Church Gives Final OK to Neocatechumenate (Zenit) Pope Benedict XVI praised the approval: \\"With these ecclesiastical seals, the Lord confirms today and entrusts to you again this precious instrument that is the Way, so that you can, in filial obedience to the Holy See and to the pastors of the Church, contribute, with new impetus and ardor, to the radical and joyful rediscovery of the gift of baptism and to offer your original contribution to the cause of the New Evangelization.\\". Liturgy A Neocatechumenal Eucharist in Porto San Giorgio, Italy. The Neocatechumenal Way regards liturgy as one of its three fundamental elements (tripod), along with the Word of God (scripture), and Christian community.Cf. Statutes Art. 8 ¬ß 2. The Paschal Mystery, celebrated in the Sacred Triduum, is seen as a liturgical axis and source of Christian life and a fulcrum of the Neocatechumenate which leads to \\"rediscovery\\" of Christian initiation.Cf. Statutes Art. 12 ¬ß 1. The Eucharist is essential to the Neocatechumenate, since this is a post-baptismal catechumenate lived in small communities. In fact, the Eucharist completes Christian initiation.Cf. Statutes Art. 13 ¬ß 1. The Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments has observed the Way's liturgical practices from the beginning.Cf. Notice of the Congregation for the Divine Worship on the celebrations in the groups of the Neocatechumenal Way, in L‚ÄôOss. Rom. (Italian), 24 December 1988 Pope John Paul II celebrated the Eucharist at the meeting with the communities in Porto San Giorgio in 1989, exactly as the communities do it, including the communion rite in a sitting position. Cardinal Francis Arinze, the Prefect of the Congregation from 2002 until 2008, wrote in December 2005 a private letter to Arguello, Hern√°ndez and Pezzi on behalf of Pope Benedict.On Liturgical Norms for the Neocatechumenal Way, Zenit, February 16, 2006.Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, Letter of December 1, 2005 in Notitiae 41 (2005), 563‚Äì565. . One of the points of Arinze's letter has been superseded by the Final Statutes of the Neocatechumenal Way, in which the celebrations of the Eucharist of the Neocatechumenal communities on Saturday evening have been recognized as \\"a part of the Sunday liturgical pastoral work of the parish open also to other faithful.‚ÄùFinal Statute of the Neocatechumenal Way, Art. 13, ¬ß 3. In an interview with the Spanish newspaper La Raz√≥n, Antonio Cardinal Ca√±izares, then Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship, expressed his view on the Eucharistic celebration of the Neocatechumenal Way: :\\"There are no liturgical anomalies [in the Eucharist]; everything is in full compliance with the guidelines of the ‚ÄòOrdo Missae.‚Äô What I have really seen there are Eucharists celebrated without any hurry, with a great faith, and where you can perceive the joy and the thanksgiving for the gift which is being bestowed in the Eucharist.‚ÄùInterview with Cardinal Antonio Ca√±izares, Prefect of the Congregation of Divine Worship, December 14, 2008. The Statutes also mention the sacrament of Penance celebrated according to the rite of reconciliation for multiple penitents, with individual confession and absolution.Statutes of the Neocatechumenal Way, Title II, Art. 14 ¬ß 1 In April 2012, journalist Sandro Magister reported that Pope Benedict XVI asked the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to review whether Masses celebrated by the Neocatechumenate are ‚Äúin keeping with the liturgical teaching and practice of the Catholic church‚Äù. Papal statements Pope Paul VI stated in 1974: \\"What great joy and what great hope your presence and activity give us!... Living and promoting this reawakening is what you call a form of 'follow-up to Baptism', which will renew in today's Christian communities those effects of maturity and deepening which in the early Church were achieved by the period of preparation for Baptism.\\" John Paul II, in 1980, regarding the nature of the Way, said that, \\"being a way, it is also movement\\". In his letter Ogni Qualvolta (1990), he \\"recognize[d] the Neocatechumenal Way as an effective means of Catholic formation for society and for the present time.\\" In February 2014, Pope Francis told the members of the Neocatechumenal Way that \\"[t]he Church is grateful for your generosity! I thank you for all that you do in the Church and in the world.\\" Francis added that \\"[t]he freedom of the individual must not be forced, and you must respect even the eventual choice of those who should decide to look outside of the Way, for other forms of Christian life\\". On March 6, 2015, Pope Francis again addressed the Neocatechumenal Way in Vatican City: \\"I confirm your call, I support your mission and I bless your charism. I do not do so because he [pointing at Kiko] paid me, no! I do so because I want to do it. You will go in Christ's name to the whole world to bring his Gospel: Christ precedes you, Christ accompanies you, Christ will bring to fulfilment the salvation of which you are bearers!\\" See also * Light-Life Movement Notes, documents and references External links * * Statute of the Neocatechumenal Way (in English) Neocatechumenate Category:1964 establishments in Spain ","title":"Neocatechumenal Way"},{"id":"2510155","text":"Planes Mistaken for Stars is an American rock band formed in Peoria, Illinois in 1997. Working with several different labels, they released three studio albums and four EPs before breaking up in 2008. While rooted in the post- hardcore and emo scenes of the turn of the century, Planes Mistaken for Stars developed a distinctive musical style strongly influenced by heavy metal and rock and roll. Reuniting for live performances in 2010, they went on to release their fourth album Prey in 2016. History =Formation (1997‚Äì1999)= In 1997, lead singer and guitarist Gared O'Donnell started the band with guitarist Matt Bellinger, bassist Aaron Wise and drummer Mike Ricketts.Strong, Martin C. (2003) \\"Planes Mistaken for Stars\\", in The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, Shortly after the band self-released a self- titled EP in 1998, Wise was replaced by Jamie Drier. Deep Elm later reissued the EP in August 1999. They also released the 7\\" single \\"Fucking Fight\\" on Steve Aoki's Dim Mak Records later that same year. =Intermediate years (1999‚Äì2006)= In 1999, Planes Mistaken for Stars moved to Denver, Colorado. After the move, the band recorded their second release for Deep Elm, Knife In The Marathon. In 2001, the band signed to Gainesville, Florida's No Idea Records to release Fuck with Fire. The next year they released an EP titled Spearheading the Sin Movement and also made an appearance on Black on Black: A Tribute to Black Flag, a tribute to the hardcore punk band Black Flag. In 2003, Planes saw its second line up change. Jamie Drier left the band and was replaced by Chuck French. Chuck played his first show with Planes on November 2, 2003. Later that year, Planes recorded Up in Them Guts with A. J. Mogis, whose most notable work is with Saddle Creek artists Bright Eyes and The Faint. Up in Them Guts was released in 2004 on No Idea. To promote the record, the band took on one of the lengthiest tour schedules of their career, covering the United States and Europe with a bands such as The Ataris, Cursive, Against Me!, Dillinger Escape Plan, Hot Water Music and High on Fire on six separate tours.Ankeny, Jason \\"[ Planes Mistaken for Stars Biography]\\", AllMusic, Macrovision Corporation They also made festival appearances at Skate And Surf Fest, Strhess Fest, and Hellfest. In 2005, Planes completed three additional headlining tours; one in the United Kingdom, and two in the United States. In early 2006, Planes' original guitarist Matt Bellinger parted ways with the band to pursue other musical endeavors starting with Ghost Buffalo and Il Cattivo. Despite rumors of the band signing with metal label Relapse Records, they announced a deal with Abacus Recordings/Century Media Records in late-2005 and planned to release a new record mid-2006. Originally scheduled for a June 6, 2006 (6/6/6) release, the record had been pushed back in order to accommodate the schedule of the producer they chose to work with, Matt Bayles, who has worked with bands such as Mastodon and Isis. What would be their final record, Mercy, was released on October 3, 2006. =Dissolution (2007‚Äì2008)= In July 2007, Planes Mistaken for Stars announced that they had broken up. They performed their final concert on February 16, 2008 at the Marquis Theater in Denver. Chuck French and Neil Keener are together in a group called Git Some. Keener is also in a drone band called Bull of Heaven with songwriter Clayton Counts. French is in a band called Wovenhand with former 16 Horsepower singer David Eugene Edwards. Gared O'Donnell is in a project titled Hawks and Doves. Matt Bellinger was in a project called Ghost Buffalo who had two records out on Denver's Suburban Home Records, and was later in a rock band called Il Cattivo. Mike Ricketts and Jamie Drier are playing together in a group called onYou in Chicago. =Reunion and Prey (2010‚Äìpresent)= Starting in 2010, Planes Mistaken for Stars began to sporadically play shows and go on tour, starting with Fest 9 in Gainesville, Florida. Planes Mistaken for Stars toured the US East Coast in mid-2012, and the US West Coast in mid-2014. Following a series of cryptic online videos with testimonials from Brann Dailor (Mastodon), Ryan Patterson (Coliseum), Nate Newton (Converge, Old Man Gloom) and Jeremy Bolm (Touch√© Amor√©), the indie label Deathwish Inc. announced it would reissue Planes Mistaken for Stars' 2006 final album Mercy on July 14, 2015, which was followed by a short promotional East Coast US tour. Along with the announcement of the reissue, the band also revealed they had been \\"quietly and persistently working on new music\\" for a near-future release also on Deathwish. A little over a year after initially teasing it, Planes Mistaken for Stars will release its fourth full- length album and first release of new material in 10 years titled Prey on October 21, 2016 through Deathwish. On September 19, 2017, an article from Westword by Jason Heller confirmed that guitarist Matt Bellinger had died on September 7. Bellinger was imprisoned in Douglas County Jail for charges including vehicle trespass, theft, possession of a weapon, and obstructing the police. According to CBS4, the death was ruled as a suicide by hanging, although an investigation was opened to determine the cause of death. Musical style According to The A.V. Club, Planes Mistaken for Stars have \\"always excelled\\" in a \\"space between classic rock, stoner metal, and discordant hardcore\\". Stereogum called them one of the \\"heaviest\\" groups of the \\"post-hardcore underground of the '00s\\"; similarly, Metal Hammer called them one of few good bands of the \\"post-hardcore/emo boom of the early part of the millennium\\", stating that their \\"gritty, rough and discordant punk always came laced with melody and imbued with the spirit of classic rock'n'roll\\". Punknews.org wrote that they are \\"one of the few [bands] who could mix genres such as metal, hardcore, punk and post-hardcore all together, to such great effect\\". According to SLUG Magazine, they have existed \\"on the periphery of emo, punk, hardcore and rock n' roll\\".

It became a civil airport in 1990 with the rebuild of the runway (from asphalt to concrete) and construction of a new terminal. After undergoing major renovations to be able to reach international standards and category 1 status, it reopened as a civilian airport on 2 December 2007. On 9 June 2014, it was captured by militants from ISIL. In February 2017, the Iraqi government recaptured the airport from the ISIL militants. It took Iraqi forces just 4 hours to battle the retreating ISIL opponent and clear them off the airport. The retaking of the airport was part of an offensive, that started on 19 February 2017 to retake Western Mosul from ISIL. History The airfield was used by the British Royal Air Force (RAF) at the end of the Mesopotamian Campaign of World War I and from 1920 RAF aircraft squadrons (and from 1922 also Royal Air Force armoured car companies) were based there while Iraq was under the League of Nations British Mandate.Jefford, RAF SquadronsWarwick, In Every Place RAF Mosul was handed over to the Royal Iraqi Air Force in 1936 under the terms of the 1931 Mandate but was used again by the RAF during World War II. It subsequently became a major Iraqi Air Force base, with at least a squadron of MiG-21s stationed there. The military airfield was one of several Iraqi Air Force airfields in the mid-1970s which were rebuilt under project \\"Super-Base\\" in response to the experiences from Arab-Israeli wars in 1967 and 1973. It was seized by Coalition forces in 2003 after Operation Iraqi Freedom. It became a United States Army facility. The 101st Airborne was the first Army Unit to occupy the base in 2003. The Base was divided into two FOB's. FOB Marez to the West and FOB Diamondback to the East which incorporated the Airfield. On 21 December 2004, fourteen US soldiers, four American employees of Halliburton, and four Iraqi soldiers were killed in a suicide attack on a dining hall at the Forward Operating Base (FOB) Marez, west of the main US military airfield at Mosul. The Pentagon reported that 72 other personnel were injured in the attack carried out by a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest and the uniform of the Iraqi security services. The Islamic terrorist group Army of Ansar al-Sunna (partly evolved from Ansar al-Islam) declared responsibility for the attack in an Internet statement. During 2006-2007, the U.S. government spent millions of dollars (15+) restoring the airfield lighting, generators, and built a new air traffic control tower on the East side of the Field. At this time, the Airfield was under the control of the 82nd Airborne (1/17th CAV) which fell under the 25th Aviation Brigade which was based at Camp Speicher/COB-FOB Speicher (Al Sahra Airfield.) The FARP or refueling point was located at the Southeast end of the airfield. In 2007, during the \\"so-called\\" surge the base was downsized and consolidated into one FOB even though the footprint did not change. The name FOB Marez remained and the name of FOB Diamondback went away. Many of the extra CHU's and other types of portable structures were sent to Baghdad to accommodate the surge that was occurring in that area. The former Iraqi Passenger Terminal was also restored and reopened for a flight in December 2007. The Passenger Terminal was at the far Southwest corner of the airfield. The flight was for The Hajj. Iraqi Airlines flew 152 passengers to Baghdad which was the first commercial flight since U.S. Forces declared the no fly zone in 1993. In 2011, the airfield and facility were turned back over to the Iraqi Government. On 9 June 2014, the airport was captured by militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant as part of the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive. Satellite images taken on 31 October 2016 shows that the airport runways have been damaged, with wide trenches carved into them and rubble placed along their lengths, according to Stratfor. Taxiways and aprons have also been sabotaged by ISIL militants. The airport was retaken by the Iraqi government in an effort spearheaded by the Federal Police on 23 February 2017.

A comic science fiction story, it follows detective Alias Node as he searches for a shapeshifting killer inside The Thirsty Tentacle, a fantastical bar on the planet Armpit VI. The player assumes the role of Alias and uses his Empathy Telepathy power to live out the memories of eight of the bar's patrons, including an immobile plant, an insect with compound eyes and a blind alien who navigates by sound. Gameplay is nonlinear and under a time limit: the player may solve puzzles and gather clues in any order, but must win before the killer escapes the bar. The Space Bar was conceived and directed by Steve Meretzky, a former Infocom employee who had previously created titles such as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Meretzky hoped to design a graphic adventure in the spirit of text-based interactive fiction games, and to recapture that genre's breadth and level of interactivity. The Space Bar began development at Boffo Games in May 1995 under publisher Rocket Science Games, whose co-founder Ron Cobb‚Äîdesigner of the Mos Eisley cantina in Stars Wars‚Äîserved as the game's art director and concept artist. Its 18-month production was troubled, and Rocket Science went bankrupt before the game's release. The Space Bar was ultimately launched by publisher SegaSoft in July 1997, several months after its completion. The game was a commercial flop, and Meretzky has described its sales performance as possibly the biggest disappointment of his career. Critics highlighted The Space Bars extensive content and number of puzzles, and regularly noted its difficulty. Some praised it as a welcome return to its genre's roots, although Computer Gaming World found the game poorly designed and needlessly abstruse. The Space Bar became the second and final title released by Boffo Games, which folded in fall 1997. Steve Meretzky later joined WorldWinner to become a developer of casual games. Gameplay and plot pop-up menu displays options such as \\"touch\\" and \\"chat\\", and the PDA head-up display takes up the bottom of the screen. The Space Bar is a graphic adventure game that takes place from a first-person camera perspective. The player points and clicks with a mouse cursor to navigate the game world, examine and manipulate the environment, look around and converse with non-player characters. In a manner that has been compared to Myst and Zork Nemesis, player movement is restricted to jumps between panoramic static screens; the camera view can rotate 360¬∞ on each screen. A pop-up menu is used to interact with characters and the environment: the menu's options change depending on the object selected, and can include actions such as \\"greet\\" or \\"take\\". At the bottom of the game screen, the PDA interface contains an item inventory, a mini-map, a journal and other features. The Space Bar is a work of comic science fiction and detective fiction, set on the planet Armpit VI and inside a fantastical alien bar called The Thirsty Tentacle. The story begins with the murder of a private investigator near The Thirsty Tentacle, in an act of industrial espionage. Human detective Alias Node and his partner Maksh witness the murder, committed by a shapeshifting assassin; and Maksh is kidnapped by the perpetrator, who hides inside the bar. Assuming the role of Alias, the player interrogates roughly 40 aliens within The Thirsty Tentacle to locate the killer. Gameplay is nonlinear: the player may progress through The Space Bar and search for clues in any order. However, there is a time limit, and the player receives a game over for failing to arrest the assassin before they escape. It is also possible for the player character to be killed. The core gameplay of The Space Bar occurs through Alias Node's Empathy Telepathy power. Activated when the protagonist establishes an emotional connection with another character, it inserts the player into the target's mind to live out its memories. Eight of these vignettes are included, with estimated lengths of 5-10 hours per segment. The Space Bars structure and puzzles change to suit each alien. For example, the blind Auditon creature must navigate by sound; objects in the game world are invisible until they make noise. Seedrot of the Vedj race is an immobile plant, and must solve puzzles from a single location, while \\"714-Z-367\\" of the Zzazzl race views the world through compound eyes. In the end, the player rescues Maksh and identifies the killer, Ni'Dopal, via an Empathy Telepathy excursion into the shapeshifter's memories. Development =Origins= Boffo Games began pre- production of The Space Bar in May 1995, after signing with publisher Rocket Science Games earlier that year. The game had initially been pursued by other publishers, including Microsoft and Viacom New Media; the latter had offered to implement it with the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine license. Boffo selected Rocket Science in large part to collaborate with that company's co-founder Ron Cobb, a concept artist whose previous design work had appeared in the Mos Eisley cantina in Star Wars. Other bonuses included Rocket Science's marketing power, which had attracted high-profile press coverage to its past titles, and the publisher's promise to create 3D models for the game's alien characters. According to Boffo, Rocket Science sought The Space Bar as part of an effort to recover from its early years, following a string of major commercial flops. \\"They'd failed miserably with the first batch of games, and they were looking for folks ... who would fix that,\\" Boffo's Mike Dornbrook said in 1998. He noted that it was \\"painful on the business side\\" to reject Microsoft's proposal, and that the publisher was \\"not happy\\" with the decision. The companies made an informal agreement to work together in the near future. With The Space Bar, Boffo Games sought to emulate text-based adventure design, but with visuals. The Space Bar was directed by Steve Meretzky, a designer previously responsible for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Planetfall and other Infocom games. His core vision for the title was \\"an adventure game composed of a lot of smaller adventure games\\", which he compared to a short story collection. This was both an experiment and an effort to invent an adventure suited to the decreasing free time he perceived among people of the era. To design The Space Bar, Meretzky collaborated with his long-time associates Patricia Pizer and Tomas Bok, and included Ron Cobb in \\"a few of the early design brainstorming sessions\\". He later noted that Cobb provided \\"countless ideas\\" on the design front. Meretzky had imagined the basis for the game in the 1980s, during Activision's purchase of Infocom. At the time, Infocom's New Zork Times newsletter was retitled The Status Line for legal reasons; however, Meretzky wanted to rename it The Space Bar and set it inside a fantastical spaceborne bar. This idea later developed into a game concept, and Meretzky began planning The Space Bar in the early 1990s. In 1996, Meretzky called the result's similarities to the contemporaneous Legend Entertainment game Callahan's Crosstime Saloon a coincidence. One of Meretzky's concerns with The Space Bar was to create a graphic adventure game with as much breadth and interactivity as Infocom's interactive fiction, which had not featured graphics. He sought to match the \\"background detail\\" of these titles, including their abundance of non-essential content to explore. Meretzky also tried to mimic the high difficulty of these older games, which he felt would lead to greater satisfaction for players. He noted during development, \\"I think it comes closest to recapturing the depth we've only seen until now in text adventures\\". Believing that an adventure game composed only of minigames would be incohesive, he devised The Space Bars murder mystery storyline and Empathy Telepathy mechanic to bridge the gaps between the game's shorter segments. Meretzky considered the result his furthest-ever push into nonlinear gameplay, and later compared the solution to his design for Boffo's previous game Hodj 'n' Podj. After roughly four months of developing the design, Boffo began production of The Space Bars visuals and code in the middle of September 1995. =Production= The Space Bar was created with the BAGEL (\\"Boffo Adventure Game Engine and Libraries\\") engine, which was designed to advance technological and interface ideas that Steve Meretzky had enjoyed in Activision's Return to Zork. However, like QuickTime VR and the Z-Vision engine of Zork Nemesis, Boffo Games chose to enable 360¬∞ panoramic scrolling of each environment the player visits. As Meretzky believed that \\"traditional 2D sprite-based animation wasn't suitable for much of what they wanted to accomplish,\\" according to PC Gamer USs Todd Vaughn, the team opted to pre-render the game's graphics. In 1996, Meretzky summarized BAGEL as an amalgam of the most successful elements of every adventure game released during \\"the last few years\\", which he had studied for ideas. Boffo co-developed the engine with Rocket Science Games. Continuing a trend that had started with Hodj 'n' Podj, Meretzky wrote no code for The Space Bar, although he did offer design input on the engine. BAGEL was programmed in C++ and was created to be platform-independent; The Space Bar was developed for both Microsoft Windows and Mac OS. A very high-level programming language was implemented for the creation of in-game content, such as conversations, locations and puzzles. Artist Ron Cobb's concept art for The Space Bar (left) guided creation of the finished game graphics by subcontractors such as Dub Media, and was Boffo Games' main impetus to sign with Rocket Science Games. Ron Cobb worked as The Space Bars concept artist and art director, the first time the latter position had existed in a Meretzky production. Previously, Meretzky had relied on his own \\"awful sketches\\" to direct the art team. One such sketch was the starting point for The Space Bars Vedj race, which was then developed through several iterations by Cobb. The Mos Eisley Cantina sequence was among the game's points of influence, and the team sought to match that scene in quality, according to Meretzky. He noted that the game's diverse cast meant that they \\"weren't just creating new characters every week, but entirely new races.\\" Boffo relied on out-of-house subcontractors for The Space Bars graphics, including Dub Media, which had produced the 3D visuals for the developer's canceled Reverse Alien game. Calling Cobb \\"something of a perfectionist\\", Meretzky described a moment when the final graphics for the Marmali race were first delivered; their number of toes was inconsistent, as Cobb's concept art had left this element vague. Cobb composed a rough model sheet to clarify the issue, and the graphics were revised. Meretzky later considered his collaboration with Cobb \\"one of the real thrills of my career\\". Mike Dornbrook, discussing the decision to choose Rocket Science for The Space Bar, said in 1998 that he believed \\"Steve was right about what Ron could contribute to the game\\". The Space Bar was initially developed alongside several other titles at Boffo, including projects with Time Warner Interactive and Time. The Rocket Science and Boffo collaboration was first revealed in 1995, as one of two games made with the BAGEL engine; the other was with Time Warner. According to Dornbrook, the budgeting scheme to develop the engine was split across \\"at least\\" two games, a gamble that Boffo felt was viable because of its number of simultaneous projects. The Time Warner contract collapsed in the fall of 1995, alongside the publisher itself, and the Time contract was lost after roughly four months of production. Microsoft, planned as what Dornbrook called a \\"fallback\\", became unavailable after the start of its partnership with DreamWorks Interactive in March 1995. This had given DreamWorks exclusive rights to develop games in the interactive movie and adventure game genres; Microsoft agreed not to compete in these fields. With The Space Bar as Boffo's sole project, its engine was left underfunded. As a result, Boffo was forced to pitch new titles to other publishers to raise money, a process that continued throughout its development. Like the games with Time and Time Warner, however, none of these further projects were ultimately released. During early 1996, a rumor about Rocket Science's impending closure spread within the game industry. Company co-founder Peter Barrett exited the publisher, which then underwent corporate restructuring in February: new hires included Bill Davis of Sierra On-Line, who became the vice president of product development. That same month, Rocket Science partnered with CyberCash in a venture to develop microtransaction-based arcade games for the Internet. According to Dornbrook, outside infusions of capital allowed Rocket Science to remain in business. The publisher signed Boffo for several more titles, and a deal was reached to increase The Space Bars budget, which fully funded creation of its engine. The Space Bar was announced in mid- February 1996, alongside Rocket Science's games Obsidian and Rocket Jockey. According to Bill Davis, the titles represented a push toward greater interactivity in the publisher's catalog; this broke with its earlier reliance on full-motion video. The Space Bar was set for release between July and September, with an eye toward capitalizing on the holiday shopping season. The Space Bar was the largest production of Meretzky's career at the time, with a team size and budget bigger than any of his previous games. He noted during development, \\"I've never worked this hard on a game before, or put so much of myself into it.\\" Its development lasted roughly 18 months and its cost surpassed that of Hodj 'n' Podj‚Äîoriginally his most expensive project‚Äîmore than twofold. However, Meretzky later remarked that The Space Bar still cost less than many of the era's other adventure games, and that \\"Boffo was a pretty lean operation\\". Budget limitations led to a number of excised features and cost-cutting measures, and became \\"extremely stressful\\" for the team. \\"[I]n terms of what we wanted to do versus what we could afford to do, it was actually my most financially tight project\\", Meretzky said. He gave the example that an on-screen character for the PDA interface was removed to save money. Additions to The Space Bars script were made throughout development, including a significant portion in the beta test phase, for which the team was unable to record new voice-over. Ultimately, Boffo included the beta-era dialogue as silent text. =Switch to SegaSoft and release= As 1996 progressed, The Space Bar was pushed back to an October release in the United States, and translation efforts got underway for its international versions. Steve Meretzky said that Rocket Science Games' European partner company would be \\"marketing heavily in Europe.\\" Rocket Science demonstrated The Space Bar alongside Obsidian at the mid-1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3); Peter Smith of Computer Games Strategy Plus wrote that the two titles \\"made a big splash\\" at the show. However, Meretzky later told Gamasutra, \\"With typical Boffo luck, they [Rocket Science] ran out of money halfway through the project and sold our game to SegaSoft.\\" In August 1996, Rocket Science laid off its marketing team of 20 people in an effort to transition exclusively to game development, and signed with SegaSoft to publish The Space Bar, Rocket Jockey and Obsidian. By the 20th, Rocket Science's old marketing division had been picked up by the publisher and put to work on these titles' promotional effort. All three games were set to launch by Christmas. SegaSoft described the deal as an effort to break into the computer game industry; its first releases in this market‚ÄîPuzzle Castle and Fractured Fairy Tales‚Äîlaunched later that year. Estimated in PC Gamer USs September 1996 issue as three-fourths complete and on track for October, The Space Bar ultimately missed Christmas, alongside Obsidian. The latter game failed commercially upon its January 1997 release, as did Rocket Jockey in late 1996. In reaction, SegaSoft split with Rocket Science in early April 1997 and the developer entered a financial downward spiral, closing later that month. This upheaval left The Space Bar \\"very much in peril\\", wrote Kate Hedstrom of GameSpot. The game was finished months before it shipped; Mike Dornbrook said development concluded in early 1997, but issues at SegaSoft regarding marketing delayed its release for half a year. Gamasutras Frank Cifaldi noted that SegaSoft had begun to pivot to \\"online ventures such as the ill-fated Heat.net\\", and was uninterested in heavily pushing The Space Bar. The first advertisements for The Space Bar, circulated in early 1997, were done in a National Enquirer style that Boffo greatly disliked. According to Dornbrook, the marketing staff responsible for the campaign and The Space Bars initial packaging was fired, but the replacement effort was hampered because the former team \\"wasted most of the marketing budget\\". He accused SegaSoft of ignoring contractual guarantees to involve Boffo in marketing decisions, and rumors arose in April that Boffo was seeking an alternative publisher for the game. SegaSoft similarly scrapped Boffo's plan to run a \\"hint line\\" for The Space Bar, according to Meretzky, who believed that this hurt its accessibility for players. Dornbrook later called SegaSoft's handling of The Space Bar \\"a disaster\\", and said that Boffo \\"actually had to threaten cancellation of the contract to even get the slightest bit of involvement\\". On July 8, 1997, SegaSoft released The Space Bar for Windows 95 and Mac OS. Reception and aftermath The Space Bar was a commercial flop. The editors of Computer Gaming World noted that it was \\"one of the year's best adventures, but, unfortunately, it never seemed to find an audience (call it the curse of Rocket Science).\\" Steve Meretzky later summarized that it \\"sold like bat guano\\", and described its commercial performance as possibly the biggest disappointment of his career. Noting that \\"the mentality of gamers had definitely changed\\" since the 1980s, Meretzky also expressed regret over his decision to make The Space Bar extremely difficult. He characterized this move as the most major design mistake of his career by 2000. However, both Mike Dornbrook and Meretzky were pleased with the game's critical reception. In 2011, Adventure Gamers named The Space Bar the 98th-best adventure game of all time. PC Gamer US writer Allen Rausch hailed The Space Bar as a return to form for its genre, which combined the high points of interactive fiction with the strengths of modern graphic adventures. Its puzzle design, humor and level of interactivity received plaudits, although Rausch found fault with its disk swapping and some of its voice acting. Conversely, Scorpia of Computer Gaming World wrote that The Space Bar \\"just misses the mark\\" and is recommendable mostly to players \\"with a high tolerance for frustration.\\" While Rausch and Scorpia agreed on the game's high difficulty and reliance on trial and error gameplay, she considered both the result of poor puzzle design. She also criticized the time limit and lack of traditional detective gameplay, and called The Space Bars comedy strained and inferior to that of Superhero League of Hoboken, despite \\"some genuinely humorous touches\\". CNET Gamecenters Barry Brenesal enjoyed the game's visuals, humor, puzzles and Empathy Telepathy sequences, but noted that The Space Bar \\"is not the end all of adventure games.\\" He agreed with Rausch's and Scorpia's assessments of the puzzles: the game features \\"arguably ... a greater density of sheer fiendishness than anything else on the market\\". In Computer Games Strategy Plus, Cindy Yans similarly praised the game as \\"a puzzle parfait from heaven\\", with an unusually extensive amount of content. Despite sharing Brenesal's admiration for the visuals, she broke with him on the quality of its animation, particularly the lack of lip sync, and agreed with Rausch on the spotty voice-over. As with Brenesal, Rausch and Scorpia, she noted the game's high level of difficulty: \\"Meretzky has constructed the most devious set of puzzles you're likely to encounter anywhere (with few exceptions)\\", Yans wrote. As a result, she echoed the latter two reviewers in recommending The Space Bar primarily to experienced adventure game players. Steve Smith of GameSpot called The Space Bars humor \\"tedious\\" and immature, and its art direction \\"uninspired and bland\\", despite Cobb's involvement. While Rausch found the character design \\"good, if a bit simplistic\\", Smith described the designs as \\"sterile and underdone\\". However, Smith still recommended the game, and praised its puzzle design and level of interactivity as a revival of earlier adventure game design. Next Generations reviewer disagreed, calling The Space Bars world non-interactive to a \\"frustrating\\" degree, and criticizing the design of certain puzzles. The reviewer liked its comedy and Empathy Telepathy mechanic, however, and concluded, \\"If you're a fan of Steve Meretzky, you might be slightly disappointed, but not by much.\\" Summarizing the game, Michael Gowan of Macworld called The Space Bar funny and found its graphics strong. He considered it \\"good for a diversion\\" for fans of the Mos Eisley Cantina scene. The Space Bar became Boffo Games' second and final release. The company attempted to survive through 1997, according to Dornbrook, but was \\"forced to give up\\" after concrete deals with publishers did not materialize. Meretzky noted that a failed project with MGM Interactive that year ultimately ended the company: the publisher requested several redesigns and platform changes, before canceling the game outright. As a result, Boffo closed in fall 1997, which Meretzky called in 2005 \\"one of the saddest days in my twenty-plus years in the industry.\\" Dornbrook joined Harmonix by May 1998, while Meretzky became a consultant on Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans and joined developer GameFX in the late 1990s. After the failure of the latter venture, he began a job developing casual games at WorldWinner in August 2000.

It forms part of Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone's Fighting Fantasy series. It is the 15th in the series in the original Puffin series (). There are currently no announced plans to republish the book as part of the modern Wizard series. Story The Rings of Kether is a science-fiction scenario in which the hero is an agent of the Galactic Federation out to uncover and break the drug rings of the Kether system. Unlike most Fighting Fantasy gamebooks, the story takes place in a science fiction setting, with the player taking on the role of a Narcotics Officer seeking to break up a drug ring located on the planet of Kether. Players are given a reasonable degree of freedom as they travel between various locations on the planet's surface and in orbit, and there are multiple paths to the final confrontation with the heads of the crime ring. The major element which distinguishes this gamebook from others in the series is the heavy use of Skill rolls, which are employed several times in quick succession during the course of the book. There are also rules for ship-to-ship combat and, unusually for a Fighting Fantasy book, different rules for unarmed and armed personal combat. Unlike most Fighting Fantasy gamebooks, The Rings of Kether is unusual in that it has two ways to win the adventure. The player can either destroy the smugglers' base or fight and kill their leader instead, a man named Blaster Babbet, to achieve ultimate victory.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1914 to 1920 as a member of the Liberal Party.  Biography  Parrish was born in Vroomanton, Canada West (now Ontario), the son of Samuel Parrish and Jane Cash, and was educated at Uxbridge. He began work in the grain trade with his father and then, in 1879, moved to Huntsville where he operated a grist and flour mill. In 1881, Parrish moved to Manitoba and operated as a grain dealer in Brandon and then, later, in Winnipeg. In 1885, he married Annie Ellen Card. He was a member of Brandon town council for two years. Parrish also served as president of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. In 1909, he co- founded the Parrish & Heimbecker grain company. He was also the director of Fidelity Trust Co., Equitable Trust Co., Capital Loan Co. and Inland Mortgage Co. Parrish was an honorary captain and paymaster with the 90th Winnipeg Rifles, and was a Methodist in religion. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1914 provincial election, defeating Conservative Harry W. Whitlaw by 910 votes in the constituency of Winnipeg South \\"B\\". The Conservatives won this election, and Parrish sat with his party in opposition. In 1915, the Conservative administration of Rodmond Roblin was forced to resign from office amid a corruption scandal. A new election was called, which the Liberals won in a landslide. Parrish was easily re-elected in his constituency, defeating Conservative Lendrum McMeans by 3,332 votes. He served as a backbench supporter of Tobias Norris's administration for the next five years. Winnipeg's electoral boundaries were dramatically changed before the 1920 provincial election. The city became a single ten-member constituency, with members elected by a single transferable ballot. Parrish finished 17th on the first count with 945 votes, and was eliminated on the 28th count. William Parrish died in Winnipeg on February 20, 1949.

Enrico Baj (October 31, 1924 - June 15, 2003)June 15 according to the Guardian, June 17 according to the-artists.org was an Italian artist and writer on art. Many of his works show an obsession with nuclear war. He created prints, sculptures but especially collage. He was close to the surrealist and dada movements, and was later associated with CoBrA. As an author he has been described as a leading promoter of the avant-garde. He worked with Umberto Eco among other collaborators. He had a long interest in the pseudo-philosophy 'pataphysics. Biography He was born in Milan into a wealthy family, but left Italy in 1944 having upset the authorities and to avoid conscription. He studied at the Milan University law faculty and the Brera Academy of Art. In 1951 he founded the arte nucleare movement with Sergio Dangelo, which unlike abstract art was overtly political. Baj himself was aligned with the anarchist movement. His most well-known pieces are probably the series of \\"Generals\\": absurd characters made from found objects such as belts or medals. He made numerous works using motifs from other artists, from Leonardo da Vinci to Picasso. Sometimes he recreated entire works of other painters. In 1972 public display of a major work, Funeral Of The Anarchist Pinelli (a reference to Carlo Carr√†'s painting The Funeral of the Anarchist Galli of 1911), was banned after the murder of the police officer believed to be responsible for Giuseppe Pinelli's death in custody. However his work continued to be political. In 1989 he designed thirty marionettes for Le Bleu-blanc-rouge et le noir, an opera by Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero to a libretto by Anthony Burgess, written for the bicentenary of the French Revolution.

Steel Phantom at Kennywood set the world record for speed before engineers added additional brakes to slow the ride down because of safety and rider comfort concerns.Kennywood history page Name Fujiyama is named after the iconic Mount Fuji, which stands to the west of Tokyo. The term Fujiyama comes from \\"fuji\\", and \\"yama\\" which means mountain. Mount Fuji is seldom referred to as \\"Fujiyama\\" in Japanese culture, but is instead more commonly referred to as \\"Fujisan\\", using the on'yomi pronunciation of the \\"mountain\\" character. The roller coaster Fujiyama is named as a play on the common foreign mistransliteration. Design As with many Japanese roller coasters, Fujiyama has a maximum rider age (~64 years old) and a (if an unlimited ride ticket has not been purchased) separate entrance fee (2,000 yen) in addition to the height restrictions typical of any roller coaster.List of roller coasters at Fuji-Q Highland The layout of Fujiyama is that of a typical out-and-back roller coaster. It incorporates many of the elements that are typical of this coaster design, including a large first drop, \\"headchopper\\" elements and a series of small \\"bunny hills\\" near the end of the coaster's course. Reception Daytime view of Fujiyama Given its record-breaking status, Fujiyama attracted considerable attention when it was built. The ride has been rated positively by some reviewers, garnering 5 stars in Steven Urbanowicz's The Roller Coaster Lover's Companion. Fujiyama did not, however, achieve a listing amongst the top 50 steel roller coaster in Amusement Today's 2009 Golden Ticket Awards.2009 Golden Ticket Award results published by Amusement Today In medical literature Fujiyama inadvertently attracted attention in 2000 after an article was published in the journal Neurology. The article discussed the possible relationship between riding roller coasters and the occurrence of subdural hematomas. The primary case study cited by the authors was a woman who had reported severe headaches after riding several roller coasters at Fuji-Q Highland (including Fujiyama). Upon investigation, it was discovered that this woman did in fact have a subdural hematoma. Subsequent research, however, has maintained that this risk remains low and is not unique to this particular coaster.

Geography Liugong Island is located about 4 kilometers from the city of Weihai. It has an area 3.15 square kilometers, with a maximum length of 4.08 kilometers (in east-western direction) and a maximum width of 1.5 kilometers. The coastline has a total length of 14.93 kilometers. In general, the terrain of the island slopes down from the north to the south. With an altitude of 153 meters, Qiding Mountain, is the highest point of the island. Its northern slope is made up of cliffs, whereas the southern side of the hill slopes down more gently. Tourists can only arrive by boats. More than half of the island's area (about 1.8 square kilometers) is covered by forest, predominantly consisting of black pine trees. The forest is protected by a national forestry park. On the island there is also a zoo, within which there are two pandas and a few other animals, of which some were gifts by the Taiwanese government to China. Naval training grounds are also located on the island, along with a museum documenting the history of the First Sino-Japanese War, and a memorial to the Beiyang Fleet. History Former British residence Archaeological evidence suggests that the island has been inhabited at least from the Warring States Period onwards. During the times of the Han Dynasty, the island was settled by members of the Liu family which resulted in the present-day name. The use of the island was subject to several changes during the Ming Dynasty: At first, all inhabitants left the island because of pirate threats. During the reign of the Jiajing Emperor, a rebel force led by Xian Wang sought refuge on the island, but the rebellion was put down shortly thereafter. Towards the end of the reign of the Wanli Emperor, settlers were recruited to re-cultivate the island. They were guarded against pirate attacks by a detachment of troops. Subsequently, a rise in shipping activities between the north and the south of China brought prosperity and an increase in population to the island. In 1663, the island's population was evacuated yet again, this time in response to the outbreak of an epidemic. 27 years later, in 1690, the island was resettled by three families (Cong, Zou, and Jiang). In 1703, the island was chosen as the base for another rebel force, but again the rebellion was short-lived. Historical navy facilities During the reign of the Guangxu Emperor, the Beiyang Fleet was founded as China's first modern navy and a telegraph center, a naval academy, and the headquarters of the Beiyang Naval Units were set up on Liugong Island. This resulted in the construction of many facilities and an increase in the island's population. Eight out of 15 modern warships which were bought from the United Kingdom and Germany were assigned to the Beiyang Fleet. On September 14, 1888, Ding Ruchang was given the command of the Beiyang Fleet. From 1887 onwards, more than 100 cannons were set up around the harbor of Weihai as well as on the islands of Liugong and Ri. Eventually, Ding Ruchang made Liugong Island his official residence. A T-shaped dock, known as the \\"iron dock\\", was constructed in the years 1889 to 1891. During the First Sino- Japanese War, the Beiyang Fleet suffered a crushing defeat and in the spring of 1895, the island was occupied by Japanese forces. Ding Ruchang committed suicide. The Japanese occupation lasted for about three years. In 1898, the United Kingdom bought the island (along with the rest of Weihaiwei) from the Japanese and agreed to hand it back to China after 25 years of use or when the Russians left the nearby Port Arthur. Local Chinese were recruited into a British regiment but the island was not fortified. The Royal Navy established a base on Liugong Island occupying and extending the existing facilities. Residences, hospitals, churches, tea houses, a sport ground, a post office, and navy cemeteries were constructed as part of the British development of the area. When the Russians left Port Arthur in 1905, the terms of the lease meant Britain should return the island to China. Britain re-negotiated the lease with the Chinese to counter a new German presence in the area. Weihaiwei was returned to the Republic of China in 1930, after which it was a special administrative region. The Chinese government allowed the Royal Navy to continue to use the naval base for another ten years under a lease. Japan invaded Weihaiwei in 1938, so after that there was a withdrawal of most British forces and supplies from Liugong, and finally a Japanese military landing and occupation of the island on 1 October 1940 (a day after Japan considered the lease expired, although Britain did not agree that their rights had lapsed since a new lease had been negotiated). In 1949, the island was occupied by the People's Liberation Army.

It is a saturated fat which is the triglyceride of myristic acid. Trimyristin is a white to yellowish-gray solid that is insoluble in water, but soluble in ethanol, benzene, chloroform, dichloromethane, and ether. Occurrence Trimyristin is found naturally in many vegetable fats and oils. =Isolation from nutmeg= Seed of nutmeg contains trimyristin The isolation of trimyristin from powdered nutmeg is a common introductory-level college organic chemistry experiment. It is an uncommonly simple natural product extraction because nutmeg oil generally consists of over eighty percent trimyristin. Trimyristin makes up between 20-25% of the overall mass of dried, ground nutmeg. Separation is generally carried out by steam distillation and purification uses extraction from ether followed by distillation or rotary evaporation to remove the volatile solvent. The extraction of trimyristin can also be done with diethyl ether at room temperature, due to its high solubility in the ether. The experiment is frequently included in curricula, both for its relative ease and to provide instruction in these techniques.

There are around 325 species in this almost cosmopolitan genus, which are commonly known as heliotropes (sg. ). It is highly toxic for dogs and cats. Etymology The name \\"heliotrope\\" derives from the old idea that the inflorescences of these plants turned their rows of flowers to the sun.Chittenden, Fred J. Ed., Royal Horticultural Society Dictionary of Gardening, Oxford 1951 ·º≠ŒªŒπŒøœÇ (helios) is Greek for \\"sun\\", œÑœÅŒ≠œÄŒµŒπŒΩ (trepein) means \\"to turn\\".

Several heliotropes are popular garden plants, most notably garden heliotrope (H. arborescens).

This style is prevalent throughout the English-speaking world, though it is by no means universal. Other Western knitting styles include continental knitting (also known as \\"left-hand knitting\\") and combined knitting. Despite the names, choice of knitting style has nothing to do with the handedness of the knitter. Various non-Western styles also exist, many of which are substantially similar to these, but which twist each stitch, making for a subtly different-looking fabric.  Technique  Here, we assume that there are already stitches on the needles, having been cast on previously. The yarn is wrapped around the right hand for tension (in one method, the tail of the yarn is wrapped around the little finger of the right hand for tension, and over the index finger for control‚Äîsee illustration). The right hand will hold the needle with the most recently knit stitches. (If at the beginning of a row, the right hand will hold the empty needle.) The left hand holds the other needle. = The knit stitch = If the yarn is sitting in front of the right needle (closer to the knitter), it should first be moved between the needles to the back. We will make one knit stitch into the first loop on the left needle. The right needle is inserted into the left side of that loop. To see what is happening, we can use the two needles to hold that loop wide open: it is through this loop that we will pull the new stitch. The yarn is wrapped counter-clockwise (as you look down at it; see photo) around the right needle, and this new loop is pulled with the right needle through the old one. The stitch is now complete. To prepare for the next stitch, we now withdraw the left needle from the just-completed stitch.

We will make one purl stitch ---which looks like the back of a knit stitch---into the first loop on the left needle. The right needle is inserted into the right side of that loop. Again, to see what is happening, we can use the needles to hold the loop open. Instead of pulling the new loop forward, the right needle is now situated to pull the new loop backward through the old loop.

Growing to tall and broad, it is a bushy, evergreen, short-lived shrub with dense clusters of bright purple flowers, notable for their intense, rather vanilla-like fragrance.Plants for a Future Common names also include cherry pie and common heliotrope. Note that the common name \\"garden heliotrope\\" may also refer to valerian, which is not closely related. Cultivation As a perennial, is hardy in zones 9 to 11, and requires wintering indoors in zones 8 or colder. It is hardy down to about . It can also be grown as a half-hardy annual (grown from seed under glass and planted out after all danger of frost has passed) in those areas. Alternatively soft-wood cuttings may be taken in summer. During the Victorian era in England this plant gained great recognition, often appearing in gardens and the herbaceous borders of parks. They were also grown as standards. A vanilla-scented heliotrope was laid on the coffin of the American poet Emily Dickinson.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/3343213/New-feet-within-my- garden-go.html =Cultivars= Its popularity may have become less in more modern times, but hardy and colourful cultivars, such as 'Princess Marina', have ensured that this plant still regularly appears in seed catalogues and garden centres. Other popular cultivars include, 'Mary Fox', the highly scented 'White Lady' or 'White Queen' and the taller 'Florence Nightingale'. *'Fragrant delight' has more fragrant purple flowers, and leaves with purple highlights. *'Marine' has large highly fragrant dark purple flowerheads to 15 cm (6 in) diameter, and burgundy leaves. *'Sweet heaven' has paler fragrant flowers and is more heat-tolerant. *'White' has flowers that smell of almonds. ‚ÄòChatsworth‚Äô and 'Princess Marina' , both strongly scented with deep purple flowers, have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Toxicity The seeds are poisonous. The ASPCA's Animal Poison Control Center article on heliotropes lists them as a substance which is toxic to horses and can induce liver failure in equines. The plant is not very palatable, but will be eaten by animals with no other forage; poisonings typically occur from ingestion of green plant material or material in hay. The toxic components can cause liver failure, referred to as \\"walking disease\\" or \\"sleepy staggers\\". Signs include weight loss, weakness, sleepiness, yawning, incoordination, yellowish discoloration to mucous membranes (icterus), neurologic problems secondary to liver failure (aimless walking, chewing motions, head pressing). Animals may appear to be normal at first, then become suddenly affected; the syndrome progresses rapidly over a few days to a week.  Medicine  The purple coloration of the flower lent itself to the so-called \\"heliotrope cyanosis\\" that was characteristic of severely ill patients in the 1918 flu pandemic.

It was Satyajit Ray's first film outside of The Apu Trilogy. It was also his first comedy and first magical realist film. Adapted from a short story of the same name by Parasuram (Rajsekhar Basu), the film offered an early glimpse of Ray's sense of humour, centered on a middle-class clerk who accidentally discovers a stone that can turn other objects into gold. Plot Paresh Chandra Dutt (Tulsi Chakrabarti), a middle-class bank clerk in Kolkata, attends a charity match on a rainy day rather reluctantly. At Curzon Park (modern-day Surendranath Park), where the match is apparently to be held, he finds a small, round stone. Thinking it is a marble, he gives it to his nephew. The child discovers that it turns metal into gold (i.e. the philosopher's stone). Dutt \\"buys\\" the stone from the child with sweets after witnessing the stone's power himself. He decides to take a few old cannonballs from the city dump, turn them into gold, and sell them. This scheme makes him rich; as a chauffeur drives him home from the dump, the car pulls into the driveway of a mansion (his new home). He now has a young secretary named Priyatosh Henry Biswas (Kali Banerjee) who, among other things, mentions that Dutt is invited to a cocktail party (his first). At the party, Dutt acts slightly unnatural before engaging in drunken revelry. When another guest orders him to get out, he turns an iron figurine into gold (thus partially revealing how he became successful). It is not long before this incident is posted as a headline in the papers, causing a panic in Bengal. Paresh Dutt flees with his wife, Giribala (Ranibala Devi), leaving nearly everything (including the stone) with Priyatosh but cautioning him to hand it over if the police arrive. Soon, Mr. and Mrs. Dutt are taken to a police station for interrogation, and the police discover that the desperate Priyatosh has swallowed the stone. Dr. Nandi (Moni Srimani), a medical specialist, informs the inspector (Haridhan Mukherjee) that Priyatosh is digesting the stone. Soon after Paresh and Giribala Dutt hear of this, they notice the golden objects turning back into iron. The Dutts happily rejoin their servant (Jahar Roy) and Priyatosh.

Other credits * Art Direction ‚Äì Bansi Chandragupta * Sound Editor ‚Äì Durgadas Mitra The credits for Parash Pathar are presented not in Bengali (the language used for credits in almost all of Satyajit Ray's films), not even in English, but in French. (This is probably because Ray's films had begun to be quite popular in France.) For this reason, some DVDs of the film include the title \\"Parash Pathar (la pierre philosophale),\\" i.e. the title in Bengali and French, respectively. This is the first Satyajit Ray film to be released with Chhabi Biswas as an actor. In this film, he is merely one of the several guests at the cocktail party. However, in Ray's next film (Jalsaghar), he has the lead role. Critical reception Parash Pathar \\"would belong among Ray's best work, were it not for some rough edges which betray the speed at which it was shot .... its humour only partly transplants to the west.\\" says Andrew Robinson. Satyajit Ray himself described the film as a \\"combination of comedy, fantasy, satire, farce and a touch of Pathos.\\"Parash Pathar URL accessed on 3 April 2006 The film was entered into the 1958 Cannes Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Palme d'Or (Best Film).

He is best known for leading an anti-internment march which developed into the Bloody Sunday massacre on 30 January 1972, in Derry, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, after British soldiers opened fire on the crowd. Early years Cooper was born to a working-class Protestant family in Killaloo, County Londonderry, and later moved to the \\"Bogside\\" area of Derry city. He was briefly a member of the Claudy Young Unionist Association until April 1965 when he joined the Northern Ireland Labour Party. As the Labour candidate in the Stormont general election that year, he attracted a moderate amount of cross-community support, but was not elected. Committed to non-violence, he became a major figure in the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association, which campaigned for equality during the late 1960s. In 1968, Cooper resigned from the Labour Party and founded the Derry Citizens' Action Committee (DCAC), serving as its president until the following year. In the summer of 1968, at a protest meeting in the Guildhall foyer, he suggested that Catholics and Protestants alike should fight for their rights \\"as the blacks in America were fighting\\". Attempting to rise above sectarian politics, he remained hopeful that both Catholics and Protestants could work together, particularly the working classes of both groups, who he believed shared the same greater interests. His nationalist stance, however, led many fellow Protestants to view him as a traitor. Cooper nonetheless remained loyal to the Anglican Church of Ireland. Civil rights campaign Cooper continued his civil rights campaigning, ignoring a month- long ban imposed on marches in Derry in November 1968 by organising a march two days later with the DCAC in which up to 15,000 people took part. Following violence resulting from numerous illegal marches in the city, Cooper called for a halt to spontaneous marches. After escalation of street disturbances at the start of the year, following a march by the People's Democracy movement, which resulted in residents of the Bogside cordoning off areas with impromptu barricades, Cooper managed to persuade locals to remove the barricades. The damage seemed irreparable, however, after a march in Newry got out of control. Most Protestants and many Catholics who had remained supportive of the civil rights actions now withdrew their support. Parliament In the 1969 general election, Cooper was elected as an independent member of the Parliament of Northern Ireland for Mid-Londonderry, defeating the sitting Nationalist Party MP, Paddy Gormley. On 12 August ‚Äì the start of the few intense days of violence which have become known as the Battle of the Bogside ‚Äì Cooper tried to restrain Catholics protesting an Apprentice Boys of Derry parade by linking arms with John Hume and Eddie McAteer. However, they were swept aside and Cooper was knocked unconscious by a brick.Ibid pp. 666 Cooper was suspended from Stormont for a week on 20 March after a protest in the Chamber over a Public Order Bill. SDLP On 21 August 1970, Cooper co-founded the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) with Hume, Paddy Devlin, Austin Currie, Paddy O‚ÄôHanlon and Gerry Fitt. Cooper organised a civil rights and anti- internment march for 30 January 1972, which was to develop into Bloody Sunday, whereupon fourteen unarmed civilians were murdered by soldiers from the Parachute Regiment on duty in Derry, who opened fire on the crowd. After the prorogation of the Stormont Parliament, Cooper was elected as one of the representatives of Mid Ulster to the Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973 and the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention in 1975. He was also the SDLP's candidate in the constituency in both the February 1974 and October 1974 Westminster elections. By standing in the first of these, he split the nationalist vote and in effect ensured the defeat of independent MP Bernadette McAliskey. In 1983, Cooper stood aside after the boundary changes for the new Foyle constituency to let his colleague and friend John Hume contest the seat. The increase in levels of violence intertwined with the politics made Cooper slowly move away from politics. He was later an insolvency consultant. Legacy At the height of his political career, Ivan Cooper commanded the largest support of any nationalist Stormont MP. A film was released in 2002, called Bloody Sunday, in which Cooper is portrayed by actor James Nesbitt. He was the husband of Frances Cooper, and had two daughters; Sinead and Bronagh Cooper.https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/tributes-for- ivan-cooper-protestant-in-vanguard-of-civil-rights-movement-38257141.html References Category:1944 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Members of the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention Category:Members of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland 1969‚Äì1973 Category:Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly 1973‚Äì1974 Category:Socialists from Northern Ireland Category:Politicians from County Londonderry Category:Protestant Irish nationalists Category:Social Democratic and Labour Party members of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland Category:Members of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland for County Londonderry constituencies Category:Junior ministers of the 1974 Northern Ireland Assembly ","title":"Ivan Cooper"},{"id":"2510463","title":"Fuji-Q Highland"},{"id":"2510465","text":"The Undead is a 1957 horror film directed by Roger Corman and starring Pamela Duncan, Allison Hayes, Richard Garland and Val Dufour. The authors' original working title was The Trance of Diana Love. The film follows the story of a prostitute, Diana Love (Duncan), who is put into a hypnotic trance by psychic Quintis (Dufour), thus causing her to regress to a previous life. Hayes later starred in Attack of the 50 Foot Woman (1958). The film was released by American International Pictures as a double feature with Voodoo Woman. Plot Quintus, a psychic researcher who has spent seven years in Tibet, wants to send someone back in time into a past life. He hires a prostitute, Diana Love, and plans to send her into a trance over 48 hours so she can access her past life. He does it in front of a doctor and pays Diana Love $500. Quintus puts Diana into a trance and sends her back into the Middle Ages, where she shares the body of her past self, Helene, who is in prison, sentenced to die at dawn under suspicion of being a witch. At Diana's urging, Helene escapes prison, earning the attention of Livia (the witch for whose crimes Helene has been blamed) and of Satan himself. Via the psychic link between Diana and Helene, Quintus physically goes back in time to convince Helene to avoid her death, so he can witness the results of history changing. However, if Helene evades execution, her future selves, including Diana, will never come into existence, so she accepts her fated death. When Helene dies, her link with Diana disappears, leaving Quintus physically stranded in the past, much to Satan's amusement.Synopsis at AMG Cast *Pamela Duncan as Diana Love/Helene *Richard Garland as Pendragon *Allison Hayes as Livia *Val Dufour as Quintus Ratcliff *Mel Welles as Smolkin *Dorothy Neumann as Meg-Maud *Billy Barty as The Imp *Bruno VeSota as Scroop *Aaron Saxon as Gobbo *Richard Devon as Satan *Dick Miller as The Leper Production =Script= The Undead was inspired by an interest in reincarnation during the 1950s (as was the film The She-Creature). Notably the book The Search for Bridey Murphy by Morey Bernstein was made into a film in 1956. Charles Griffith recalls: > It was originally called ‚ÄúThe Trance of Diana Love‚Äù. Roger said to me, ‚ÄúDo > me a Bridey Murphy picture.‚Äù And I told him that by the time Paramount > finishes theirs, ours will fail.

He‚Äôd > send girls out with scripts.Aaron W. Graham, 'Little Shop of Genres: An > interview with Charles B. Griffith', Senses of Cinema, 15 April, 2005 > accessed 25 June 2012 Griffth later elaborated: \\"I separated all the different things with sequences with the devil, which were really elaborate, and the dialogue in the past was all in iambic pentameter. Roger got very excited by that. He handed the script around for everybody to read, but nobody understood the dialogue, so he told me to translate it into English. The script was ruined. Mel Welles said \\"it was a wonderful script and it probably would have been the cult film rather than Little Shop of Horrors had it been shot that way. But either Roger or someone at American International Pictures didn't think it was commercially viable to do it that way and at the last minute a decision was made to rewrite the script without that.\\" By the time The Undead was being made, the popularity of reincarnation was starting to dwindle. Therefore, Corman decided that they needed to change it up a little and added the time travel elements of Quintis, and a title change. =Finance= In May 1956 Corman announced the movie was to be made for Walter Mirisch at Allied Artists.Drama: Preminger Places 'Saint Joan' First in New Deal; Hypnosis Rage Goes On\\" Schallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times 4 May 1956: B9. In July 1956 Variety reported that Corman would fully finance the film himself, although it would be distributed by AIP. =Cast= Pamela Duncan says Roger Corman called her up \\"out of the blue\\" and offered her the lead. \\"I don't know what made him think of me except that he must have seen me in something; I worked a lot and I was on TV a lot.\\" She later worked with Corman on Attack of the Crab Monsters. Mel Welles called his role of Smolkin \\"one of the best characters I ever played. I played him kind of insane and what was wonderful was the one of my reviews compared me to Stanley Holloway in one of his Shakespearean gravedigger roles.\\" Shooting Filming started 26 July, 1956. The movie was filmed in a converted supermarket, and was completed in only ten days, according to Griffith, costing $70,000.Joe Dante on The Undead at Trailers From HellRoger Corman & Jim Jerome, How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never lost a Dime, Muller, 1990 p 44 Duncan says it was shot in six days. Griffith has also said \\"it was fifty-five thousand dollars, fifteen trees with Spanish moss and a fog machine. That was a big deal for Roger then.\\" The bats that the imp and witch continually change into were left over from another Corman movie, It Conquered the World. Griffith says the film was \\"a fun picture to shoot... We filled it [the supermarket] with palm trees and fog, and it was the first time Roger had used any of that stuff. He didn't like to rent anything. You could see the zipper on the witch's dress and all the gimmicks were very obvious and phony‚ÄîRoger deliberately played to skid row, a degenerate audience.\\" Welles recalls \\"we almost died of asphixiation from all the croesete fog that was created in\\" the supermarket. Devon said \\"They had a bee-smoker to create the dreadful-smelling fog.\\" Some exteriors were shot at a place called The Witch House in Beverly Hills. The movie was the first of several Devon made with Corman. However he did not enjoy The Undead: > His temper was really quite awesome.

We did it in one take, and that was it. Devon also recalled that \\"Mel Welles just played everything off the top of his head and he came out all right, but it was difficult to keep from looking foolish. Pamela Duncan pressed very hard, and Dick Garland worked hard, too. but everything was against them as far as the dialogue was concerned. It was just coming down around their ears. Everybody that was on the show was quite professional and they really tried. They really put forth an effort.\\" Pamela Duncan says she enjoyed working with Corman. Reception Corman wanted to use a crypt to launch the film. The movie's release was delayed until 1957. =Critical= The Los Angeles Times called The Undead \\"a better than usual horror film... a rather imaginative yarn... for this type picture the acting is quite good...

The series was produced by Mandalay Television for Columbia TriStar Television. Oh Baby was based on the real-life experience of the show's executive producer Susan Beavers. The show's theme song was performed by Jimmy Beavers, Susan's brother. Plot The series follows Tracy Calloway, a single working woman who decides to have a child through artificial insemination, a decision that was spurred by an increase in working mothers at her workplace. Using a fourth wall technique, she tells the audience watching about the joy and sorrows of being a single mother while showing videos of her and her family and friends in her life. As Tracy successfully goes through with the process, she eventually finds support in Dr. Charlotte St. John, her best friend--who also works at Tracy's company as a psychiatrist and can dole out advice on how to be a single mother (she was twice divorced and had two children with different fathers)--and in her brother Ernie, an aspiring painter who wants out of his marriage and to move to Europe. The only person who initially has mixed feelings about Tracy's decision was her mother, Celia. At first, Celia thinks that Tracy has made the biggest mistake of her life by going through with the procedure, but eventually Celia comes to accept it. Despite that, Tracy knows her mother's reputation for trying to control her and Ernie's life, which indeed did play out through her pregnancy, with hilarious results. Tracy's pregnancy also involves other situations which meet with hilarious results such as constant and uncontrollable water bursts and learning to breastfeed, including an incident when her lactating breast is accidentally exposed at a restaurant. Tracy also plays matchmaker for Charlotte, by hooking her up with her gynecologist Dr. Doug Bryan, leading to an on-again-off-again romance between the two. By the end of the first season, Tracy gives birth to a son (a viewers' contest sponsored by Lifetime allowed fans to pick the baby's name). In August 1999, \\"Daniel\\" was the choice picked by viewers. During the second season, Tracy finds herself trying to balance a life as a working mother as well as bearing Celia's constant interference, with disastrous results. That friction eventually also costs Tracy her job. As soon as she is let go, her fellow co-workers snatch everything from her cubicle. Following that event, she and Charlotte decide to go into business for themselves by launching an online retail business called TrustMom.com whose logo is a picture of Celia, despite Tracy's objections.

He was drafted by the then- Anaheim Angels in the 38th round (1137th overall) of the 1997 MLB draft. He began his career as a reliever in with Low-A Boise, earning a 7-2 record with two saves and a 2.94 ERA. The next year, he moved to Single-A Cedar Rapids, compiling a 6-5 record, seven saves and a 3.65 ERA. In , he split his time as a starter and a reliever at High-A Lake Elsinore, gaining a 10-3 record with a 2.52 ERA and one save. In nine starts, he pitched two complete games and one shutout. For his efforts that year, he was named Angels Minor League Pitcher of the Year. He was promoted to Triple-A Edmonton in , where he struggled with a 7-13 record and a 5.41 ERA. Major league career Though he started the season with the Triple-A Salt Lake Stingers, Shields was called up to the MLB on May 25, making his debut against Tampa Bay Rays on May 26, pitching one- plus innings and allowing one hit and one walk. He was optioned back to Salt Lake, but was recalled on June 27. In eight relief appearances with the Angels, Shields allowed eight hits and seven walks before being optioned back to Salt Lake, where he stayed for the remainder of the season. Though he began with the Stingers, Shields was recalled to the major leagues on June 14, this time for good. In his final 38 relief appearances, he allowed only seven earned runs, only allowing opponents a .176 average, the best in the league. He also started for the club on September 27 against the Seattle Mariners, receiving a no-decision and allowing four hits and two earned runs while striking out two. Shields was a fixture in the Angels bullpen after the 2002 campaign. He was a member of the 2002 World Series Championship team, but did not fare well in the postseason‚Äîhe allowed 2 home runs in 1 innings in Game 5 of the Series, his only appearance in the playoffs that year. Shields began , his first full year in the majors, in the bullpen. He posted a 1.68 ERA, working at least three innings twelve times. He led the American League with 69.2 innings of relief before moving into the Angels' starting rotation to end the season in August. As a starter, Shields was 4-6 with a 3.89 ERA, pitching at least seven innings in six of his thirteen starts. He ended the season with a 5-6 record and a 2.85 ERA. For the campaign, Shields returned to the Angels bullpen. He pitched 22 consecutive shutout innings from May 9 to June 11, and worked three scoreless innings five times during the season. With fellow reliever Francisco Rodr√≠guez, he was part of the first pair of relievers to post 100 strikeouts in one season since , and was third in the American League in strikeouts with 109. In the post-season that year, he struggled in two appearances during the ALDS, pitching three innings and allowing two earned runs with a 6.00 ERA. When Rodr√≠guez replaced veteran Troy Percival as the Angels' closer in , Shields emerged as the club's trusted setup man, pitching the eighth inning as the bridge to Francisco. In this capacity, he led the American League with 91.2 innings of relief pitching, and ranked second with 98 strikeouts and 32 holds. When Francisco was placed on the disabled list from May 15 to May 31, Shields stood in as the club's closer, earning five saves in six save opportunities. Overall, Shields posted a 10-11 record with a 2.75 ERA. Shields represented the United States in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, the only member of the Angels to play for the USA squad. Shields finished the season with a 7-7 record, an ERA of 2.87 and 84 strikeouts. He led the league in holds with 31, and was second among American League relief pitchers in innings pitched with 87.2 innings. Shields' 2007 season saw his ERA rise to 3.86 as he also failed to surpass 80 innings. He finished 4-5 in 71 games. In 2008, Shields had a career low 2.70 ERA in 64 games. Early in the 2009 season, he had to receive surgery on his left leg which forced him onto the disabled list for the remainder of the season. He finished with only 20 appearances on the season. Shields was the team's setup man for the Angels prior to his surgery, holding the lead if necessary in the 8th and sometimes both 7th and 8th innings until the Angels go to closer Brian Fuentes. After the surgery, Shields was not the same for the 2010 season. He pitched in 43 games while also starting a game for the first time since 2003. His ERA rose to 5.28 while also walking 34 in only 46 innings. His control issues were due to the injury he sustained in the previous year. Shields retired after the end of the 2010 season. In 2011, he was named by Sports Illustrated as the \\"Setup Man of the Decade.\\" Pitches and abilities He is highly praised not only for the quality of his performance, but for his versatility. In his career with the Angels, he has served as a starter, long reliever, middle reliever, setup man, and closer, depending on the needs of the team at the time. Shields is known to have a \\"rubber arm\\", meaning he has excellent endurance and does not need to ice his arm after pitching. During college, he once pitched a game of 16 innings, throwing 261 pitches. He throws a hard, sinking fastball that clocks anywhere between 92 and 95 MPH, and a slurve. He is most famous though for throwing his 2-seam/No-seam fastball with tremendous movement. Personal life Shields resides in Northville, Michigan, during the offseason with his wife, Jaimie McGovern Shields and two daughters, Kayla and Ella. Shields graduated from Fort Lauderdale High School, where he played as a pitcher as number 10.

Manufactured by S&S; ‚Äì Sansei Technologies, the launched coaster uses compressed air to propel its trains. It opened on 21 December 2001 as the fastest roller coaster in the world with the fastest acceleration, reaching a top speed of in 1.8 seconds. The fastest speed record was previously held by Superman: The Escape and Tower of Terror, both of which accelerated to in 7 seconds. The ride was refurbished in 2017, removing the top hat element in favor of a vertical loop and increasing its speed and acceleration to in 1.6 seconds. Steel fabrication was provided by Intermountain Lift, Inc. Speed and acceleration The 55 second ride takes the rider across of steel tracks, and peaks at a maximum height of . Reaching top speeds of in 1.6 seconds, Do-Dodonpa retained the title of world's fastest roller coaster for nearly a year and a half before Cedar Point's Top Thrill Dragster took it in May 2003. This gives the ride an acceleration of , and up to 3.3 g. By comparison, astronauts only experience 3 g at liftoff, though for a duration substantially longer than 1.6 seconds. While the ride has been tested at speeds of up to , its rubber tires prevent it from performing reliably at these speeds, so engineers capped the speed at prior to the ride's renovation. Before Do-Dodonpa's initial opening, only two roller coasters reached or went beyond the barrier. As of 2020, that number stands at six (including Do-Dodonpa): Superman: Escape from Krypton; Red Force; Top Thrill Dragster; Kingda Ka; Do-Dodonpa; and Formula Rossa, the world's fastest roller coaster. Furthermore, Tower of Terror II, which was previously known as Tower of Terror, once traveled at least , but it is currently no longer in operation. 2017 renovation Dodonpa closed in 2016 for a major renovation. The ride's top hat was removed and replaced with a vertical loop, announced in a February 2017 press release from the manufacturer. Dodonpa reopened on July 15, 2017. The renovated and revamped ride featured an increased acceleration and maximum speed, which changed from in 1.8 seconds to in 1.6 seconds. The track length also increased from . The renovation made Dodonpa the world's first air-powered coaster to feature an inversion, as well as the fastest coaster in the world with an inversion. Ride experience The name of the ride stems from the deep, ominous drumming sound that flows from the speakers as passengers wait in line to board the train. This repetitive percussive music is created by taiko drums, an old traditional Japanese drum that was used to demonstrate power and influence in pre-modern Japanese villages. These drums were supposedly used in warfare to rally troops and scare off the enemy with their thundering sound. While waiting in line, riders hear the drums played through speakers, building up tension and excitement. Often, riders will chant along with the drum sound, which plays three consecutive beats represented by the sounds Do-don-pa. Once passengers board the ride, the train moves them from the loading station to the launch pad, where it waits, allowing time for the compressed air to build up. When the ride is ready to launch, a voice in English says \\"Launch time!\\" and begins a three-second countdown to launch. To keep riders on their toes, designers added a false start feature, in which riders will occasionally experience a \\"failed\\" launch, signaled by loud ringing alarms, followed by a surprise \\"accidental\\" launch. After the coaster shoots off at , it enters a wide-radius curve followed by a vertical loop (previously a top hat prior to 2017). The train then enters a slight left turn before hitting a brake run. A second left turn followed by a right U-turn, both taken at slower speeds, brings the train back to the station. The ride has a total of 4 trains with 4 cars per train. Each car seats 2 riders side-by-side, resulting in a total capacity of 8 riders per train. Incidents Since its opening in 2001, Dodonpa has had one incident resulting in an injury. The injury occurred on 15 May 2007 when a 37-year-old man sustained a minor injury when a plastic cover at the front of the train came loose and hit his right knee. The man was not badly injured because the plastic cover disconnected near the end of the ride when the train had slowed down significantly. The park operator stated that the cover likely came off due to cracks created over time by vibrations in the train. Further inspection of the other trains showed no similar damage.

He was superintendent, principal, teacher, and coach for Cheyenne Mountain Schools in Colorado Springs, Colorado from 1916-1951, and taught folk dancing. Biography Shaw was born in Denver, Colorado, but the family moved to Southern California when he was two years of age. His father was in the real estate business. The family returned to Denver when Shaw was nine years old, and then to Colorado Springs two years later. He graduated from Colorado College in 1913 and married poet Dorothy Stott Shaw. They had two children; daughter, Doli, and son, David. He started teaching biology and sophomore English at Colorado Springs High School, and then became superintendent of the Broadmoor District's Cheyenne Mountain School on the outskirts of Colorado Springs. During his time teaching folk dance he noticed that all the square dancing callers were getting old, and there was no new generation to take over. He also noticed a lack of continuity in the activity in different parts of the country. Shaw came up with a solution that he hoped would keep the activity from dying out. Shaw traveled the country, and compiled instructions for traditional square dances from different callers all over the country. He documented them, and tried them out on the students he taught. He formed the Cheyenne Mountain Dancers, a high-school exhibition team, which toured the United States in the 1930s and 1940s, appearing in more than 50 major cities. In 1949 the American Academy of Physical Education cited \\"the Lloyd Shaw Folk Dance Program as a noteworthy contribution to physical education.\\" He also wrote books and articles and conducted week-long summer classes for teachers and callers into the 1950s, where he not only taught the dances to other teachers, but taught them also the principles of teaching, and his vision of good dancing. As the popularity of square dancing grew, square dance callers began extracting individual calls from these dances, and attempts at standardised lists were developed. These lists were later adopted by callers, and organisations such as Callerlab and later the American Callers Association formed to manage and promote a universal list and the type of dance leadership that Shaw envisioned. Dr. Lloyd Shaw died of a stroke in 1958. The Lloyd Shaw Foundation was created in 1964 to preserve and promote his approach to square dancing.

It is more commonly known as the Beaubien House, and is currently the headquarters of the Michigan Architectural Foundation and the American Institute of Architects of Michigan. The building is one of the oldest remaining houses in Detroit, and was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1975 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. History The Beaubien House is built on the site of one of Detroit's original ribbon farms, owned by Antoine Beaubien. The farm had a quarter of a mile frontage on the river, but which ran nearly three miles inland. Beaubien was a Colonel in the Detroit Militia and received the patent certificate for his land in 1810.Beaubien House History In June 1850, just before his death, Antoine Beaubien sold lot 8 on Jefferson to Charles J. Trombly for the sum of $2,000. Trombly was Beaubien's cousin and a recent graduate of Georgetown College. The consensus among historians is that the house was built by Trombly sometime during 1851 for use by Trombly and his new wife. Over the next two decades, the house was owned or rented by multiple families. These include some of the city's oldest and most familiar names, such as McClelland, Cicotte, Whipple, Chapoton, Campau, and Beecher, among others. In 1872, the house was sold to John F. Antisdel, whose family owned or rented the home until 1943 (save a five-year period when William H. Machen lived in the home). After World War II, ownership records are spotty. In 1956, photographer Fred A. Plofchan rented the house; he bought it in 1965. During this time, plumbing lines were extended to the upper levels, which were rented as studio apartments, and the house was used as a combination of office and residential space. The Michigan Architectural Foundation later rented the building, completely renovating it in 1987. Architecture The house is constructed of brick and sits on a fieldstone foundation. Walls are constructed of plaster over 2\\" X 6\\" studs. The house has a full basement and three floors above. The first floor consists of a front parlor with a marble manteled fireplace, and two smaller rooms, one of which was likely a dining room. Both the second and third floors had two rooms.

It uses the same pseudo-3D overworld system for which the series is most famous. Other features of Dragon View are its side-view action role-playing game (RPG) hybrid gameplay (used when exploring more detailed areas such as towns and dungeons), it's well translated first-person storyline, and its emphasis on player-driven undirected exploration. The Drakkhen series' most recognizable feature is its custom overworld engine. First used by the original Amiga version of Drakkhen, it was later used in the PC and SNES ports. The Dragon View version sports basic terrain shading and mountainlike \\"boundaries\\" that enclose areas of the continent. While not \\"True 3D\\", the overworld engine simulates depth on its own (without the aid of supplementary hardware such as the Super FX chip) using sprite scaling and rudimentary rendering. This system is able to run smoothly on standard SNES hardware because little more than half of the total screen area is ever in use. Since the top and bottom panels are completely static during overworld navigation, all hardware power is focused on rendering the first-person view. Even so, framerates can suffer as many sprites are sometimes present on a single screen. Dragon View has also been ported to Steam, along with many other classics by Piko Inc.

Sagene was one of Norway's oldest industrial areas dating to the mid-19th century. Oskar Braaten attended school in Sagene until he was 15 years old. In 1899, he was hired by antiquarian bookstore Bertrand Jensen, where he remained until 1910. Though born and raised in Oslo, Braaten joined the mostly rural landsm√•l-movement. Braaten is best known for his popular plays and novels depicting the life of factory workers alongside Akerselva in Oslo. He published seven novels between 1917 and 1925. Braaten convey a new image of the Oslo not seen before in literature. Braaten was able to provide vivid and richly nuanced images of working-class life on the east side of Oslo during a historical period of industrialization. Criticism of injustice and inequality arises, but there is relatively little political tendency in his literary works. .Oskar Braaten (Dagbladet) He served as an advisor and theater manager at the Det Norske Teatret in Oslo from its start in 1915 until his death. He was a consultant for the theater 1915-25, served as its theater director (Teatersjef) from 1934 to 1936 and dramatic performance manager from 1937 until his death. He was editor of For Bygd og By in 1912 and co-editor of the St. Hallvard from 1933.

The town is located in a valley below Stacks Bluff (1527 m) and it is an old tin mining town, though the mine closed in 1982. Prior to this Rossarden was one of Australia's major tin producing towns. The main road into and out of the town is Rossarden Road. At the , Rossarden and the surrounding area had a population of 172. According to the 2011 census, this number appeared to have grown to 301 people. In 2008 an irregularity in the deed paperwork belonging to the residents of Rossarden was discovered. It was discovered that each resident actually owned the house next door to their own. The irregularity has since been corrected by the State Government. By 1933 the town was said to be growing steadily with a town hall, a post office, and 17 dwellings built in a matter of months, while a community ball was reported to have been arranged in order to raise funds for a tennis and badminton court. The post office opened on 20 November 1933. Nearby locations include Storeys Creek, where there was a wolfram mine, Fingal and Avoca. The town's decline was captured in the Weddings Parties Anything song 'Rossarden'. A book was written about the town in 2004 focusing on the stories of former residents. There are also various books written about the mineralogy in the area. In recent times there has been a campaign to draw tourists to the area. In 2016 plans for a new base station that would better serve mobile telephone coverage in the Rossarden area were revealed.

It was Ray's second entirely original screenplay, after Kanchenjungha (1962). The story revolves around a matinee idol on a 24-hour train journey from Kolkata to Delhi to receive a national award. However, he ends up revealing his mistakes, insecurities and regrets to a young journalist, who realises that behind all his arrogant facade lies a deeply troubled man as his life‚Äôs story is gradually revealed through seven flashbacks and two dreams. Plot A famous actor of Bengali films, Arindam Mukherjee (Uttam Kumar), is invited to the capital, Delhi to receive a prestigious award. He travels by the train. The morning newspaper arrives and carries with it a article on an altercation he had been involved in. In the restaurant car, he meets Aditi Sengupta (Sharmila Tagore), a young journalist who edits a modern women's magazine, Adhunika. Filled with contempt for the likes of him, she secretly plans to interview him because she thinks it would attract more readers. He soon starts to reveal his personality, and also brings to surface the inner insecurities and his consciousness of the limitations of his 'powers'. Aditi initially takes notes, surreptitiously, but later on, out of empathy almost bordering on pity, stops. However, critical of the star, she interrogates him, leading to further introspection on his part. Slowly, his guilt about the way things turned out is very visible. Arindam also mentions Shankar-da, his mentor, who had never wanted Arindam to join films, being a strong opposer of the medium. He talks about his first day in film, and on the different experiences he faced with other workers in the field and some of the things that happened to them. Toward the end of the train journey, Arindam is drunk and feels a need to confide his wrongdoings. He asks the conductor to fetch Aditi. He begins to reveal the reason behind the altercation he was a part of, but Aditi stops him, as she has already guessed. It was an affair he'd had with one of his co-actors, Promila. Afraid that he might commit suicide, Aditi makes sure he returns to his cubicle, before going back to her own. As the star re-lives and examines his life with Aditi, a bond develops between them. Aditi realizes that in spite of his fame and success, Arindam is a lonely man, in need of empathy. Out of respect for him, she chooses to suppress the story and tears up the notes she has written. She lets the hero preserve his public image.

Romance was out ‚Äì the time being so short ‚Äì but I wanted something with an interesting development. The transition from apathy mixed with a certain dislike, to sympathetic understanding, seemed a promising one. So I made Aditi a slightly snooty sophisticate who questions and resists the easy charm, good looks, sangfroid, etc etc. of the Idol, until she discovers there‚Äôs an area where he is helpless, lonely, and in need of guidance. From the point where he begins to unburden himself, Aditi can ignore his fa√ßade because she‚Äôs had a glimpse of what lies beneath. At first he is ‚Äòmaterial‚Äô for her for a journalistic probe, until the process of unbarring reaches a point where she realizes it would be unethical to exploit it. Sympathy and desire to help is the next step. The bond between the two is tenuous, but real. Intellectually clearly above him, her goodness consists in providing him with the small area of contact that exists between them‚Ä¶\\" Accolades *National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Bengali, 1967 *Bodil Award for Best Non-European Film, 1967 *Special Jury Award, Berlin International Film Festival, 1966 *Critics' Prize (UNICRIT Award), Berlin International Film Festival, 1966 *B.F.J.A Best Actor Award: Uttam Kumar *B.F.J.A Best Director Award: Satyajit Ray Nominations *Golden Bear for Best Film, Berlin International Film Festival, 1966 Preservation and restoration The film is one of four Ray films which were digitally restored and set for a re-release in January 2014.

She is the younger sister of FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder and the daughter of Teena and Bill Mulder. As a child, Samantha was abducted, ostensibly by aliens, and was never returned. It is this experience that drives her older brother Fox Mulder to join the FBI, and later take the reins of the X-Files section. Character arc On the evening of November 27, 1973, Samantha Mulder was mysteriously abducted by aliens from the Mulder family home on Martha's Vineyard, when she was 8 years old. Her older brother Fox Mulder, who was 12 years old at the time, witnessed the abduction that began his life-long obsession with finding the truth about extraterrestrials to shed light on this unexplained incident. Many episodes of the show focused on Mulder's determined efforts to discover what happened to his little sister and find out about her whereabouts or unveil her fate. However, much of Mulder's attempts had failed. When a woman who claimed to be Samantha first reappeared 22 years later as an adult, she claimed that she lost her memory after her abduction and was adopted by a new family when the aliens returned her to earth in 1979. She stated she had been gradually regaining her memory regarding her tragic childhood during the last year before finally reuniting with her real family and Mulder. Shockingly, this person was later revealed to be an imposter who was just one of the several adult Samantha clones, all of whom were killed by the Alien Bounty Hunter. Jeremiah Smith takes Mulder to a covert bee husbandry facility in remote Alberta. There, he finds a group of Samantha clones, all no older than the day the real Samantha originally disappeared in 1973. The clones had been working on the alien colonists' and Syndicate's joint project of spreading the Black Oil. The facility was soon after destroyed, and the clones were presumably killed by the Alien Bounty Hunter. Later in the fourth season, Mulder becomes convinced that Samantha was kidnapped and murdered by John L. Roche. Roche is a serial killer whom Mulder previously profiled, and helped lock up for the murder of thirteen young girls. His signature was the removal of a heart-shaped piece of cloth from each girl's clothing. Through a dream, Mulder finds another girl, and the discovery of the missing \\"paper hearts\\" reveals that two are still missing, for a total of sixteen. Roche manipulates Mulder into believing that Samantha is one of his victims, taking him to the scene of the abduction to explain it. However, Mulder took him to the wrong house and catches him in the lie. At the end of the episode Roche gives the location of one of the missing victims, but is shot and killed by Mulder during a standoff before revealing the location of the last body. At the beginning of the fifth season, The Smoking Man introduced Mulder to a woman who he claims is, and who herself believes to be, Samantha. She tells Mulder that she has children of her own, thought that her mother had died some time ago, and believed Cigarette Smoking Man to be her father. She leaves abruptly during the meeting, and is never seen again. According to Cassandra Spender, she was indeed another clone, but not the real Samantha. Samantha's true storyline is revealed and presumably resolved in the seventh season episode Closure. In that episode, Dana Scully watches a 1989 tape in which Mulder undergoes hypnotic regression therapy, which another agent describes as \\"garden-variety compensatory abduction fantasy\\" which feeds Mulder's \\"unconscious hope that his sister is still alive\\". Later, with the help of a medium, Mulder discovers that Samantha was neither abducted nor murdered. She was actually given up by their own father, who had made a secret deal with the aliens and gave them special permission to take his child. When the Syndicate formed in 1973 to work with the aliens, the aliens decided to make an arrangement to take one human member from each main Syndicate family as \\"collateral\\". William Mulder discussed this deal with his wife Teena, as to which child they would give up, but she refused to make a choice. William later decided to choose Fox, as he was the eldest. However, that decision was superseded by the Cigarette Smoking Man who forced them to take Samantha instead because he wanted the aliens to test on at least one adolescent female. The medium also helps Mulder find Samantha's old diary, which states that after she had been kidnapped by the extraterrestrials in 1973, she was constantly experimented on and then somehow returned shortly after the aliens no longer considered her valuable. She was immediately taken to an isolated place called April Air Force Base in California. Once there, she was held captive along with Jeffrey Spender, and was the subject of many torturous hybrid tests at the hands of the Cigarette Smoking Man, who she was brainwashed to believe was her father. Over time, Samantha grew to hate the tests and the scientists who mercilessly performed them on her. Unable to bear the pain of the testing any longer, in 1979 at age 14, six years after being taken from her original home, Samantha ran away. She believed that all those performing the tests had erased most of her memories, as she had only vague memories of a brother, and nothing else. Eventually, she was picked up by police as a wandering runaway and taken to Dominic Savio Memorial Hospital, suffering from paranoia and what authorities considered to be self-inflicted wounds. She gave no name or personal information and allowed no one but the emergency room nurse, Arbutus Ray, to touch her. Decades later, Ray informs Scully and Harold Pillar, the psychic, about the mysterious young girl (while Mulder stands nearby). Ray adds that a group of men (who seemed to be working for Cigarette Smoking Man) came to the hospital to claim the girl, only to find out upon their arrival that she was gone, despite being locked in her hospital room. Samantha had suddenly vanished into thin air, never to be seen or heard from again. Ray also describes how she had a vision that was eerily similar to those of others who lost children in a similar fashion. It is revealed that Samantha was consumed by \\"spiritual intervention\\" beings called \\"Walk-ins\\", which try to save the innocent souls of children who are unfairly doomed to live unhappy lives or suffer terrible fates. When Cigarette Smoking Man and his team found out where Samantha was located, the Walk-Ins took pity on the girl and turned her into an energy form called starlight, which made her die a painless death, and without leaving behind a body. While in the nearby woods later, Mulder has a paranormal experience and is briefly reunited with Samantha's ghostly spirit, which is finally at peace among all the other starlight children. After Mulder returns, Scully asks if he is all right. Finally at peace, Mulder replies, \\"I'm fine. I'm free,\\" suggesting that he, like several of the other parents whose children have disappeared, accepts that Samantha is technically dead, had been for decades. But she is no longer in pain and her soul is in \\"a better place\\". Mulder also tells Harold that he saw Harold's son and that he, like Mulder, needed to \\"let it go.\\" Samantha is mentioned again in the series finale, where Jeffrey Spender testifies at Mulder's trial he and Samantha grew up together at the military base and she died in 1987, and in The X-Files: I Want to Believe, being the inspiration that drives Mulder to try to save a likely-dead agent. Mulder is seen to admit she is dead, but keeps her picture on the wall with newspaper clippings of his own exploits with the FBI and alien evidence. Portrayal history Samantha Mulder was played as a child by Vanessa Morley, and as an adult by Megan Leitch. Several other actors played the part for individual episodes‚ÄîBrianne Benitz in the first season's \\"Miracle Man\\", Ashlynn Rose in the sixth season's \\"Dreamland II\\", and Mimi Paley in the seventh season episode \\"Closure\\". Reception Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club praised the way Samantha was presented in \\"Colony\\", saying that \\"In the seasons to come, we end up with enough Samantha's to fill a clown-car, but here, the reveal is shocking, effective, and unsettling\\".

The district has three tehsils, Budhlada, Mansa and five development blocks, Bhikhi, Budhlada, Mansa, Jhunir and Sardulgarh with three sub-tehsils.There are about 70 villages in Sardulgarh block, Mankhera village is the last village of punjab, this village is(14.7 km) away from sardulgarh and 24.9 km away from Sirsa in Haryana state. Geography Indian Punjab along with their headquarters The district is roughly triangular in shape and is bounded on the northwest by Bathinda district, on the northeast by Sangrur district, and on the south by Haryana state. It is situated on the Bathinda-Jind-Delhi railway and the Barnala-Sardulgarh-Sirsa road. The district is divided into three tehsils, Budhlada, Mansa, and Sardulgarh. The Ghaggar River flows through the Sardulgarh Tehsil in the southwestern corner of the district. Punjabi is the mother tongue as well as the official language of the district. History Mansa District was formerly a part of the Phulkia Sikh Dynasty (1722‚Äì1948) then part of Kaithal Sikh Kingdom (1762‚Äì1857). The present district was formed on 13 April 1992 from the erstwhile Bathinda district. The town is said to have been founded by Bhai Gurdas who hailed from Dhingar, Mansa district. He is said to have been married at this place among the Dhaliwal Jat Sikh. Once he came to his in-laws to take his wife along with him but they refused to send her. At this, Bhai Gurdas sat in meditation before the house of his in-laws. After some time, the parents of the girl agreed to send their daughter with Bhai Gurdas. But he refused to take her along with him, stating that he had now renounced the worldly way of life. In his memory, his Smadh was constructed where a fair is held every year in March‚ÄìApril. People in large numbers attend the fair and offer Laddus and Gur (jaggery) at Smadh. Class ‚ÄòA‚Äô municipality has been functioning in the town since 1952. The town has two Colleges, viz. Govt. Nehru Memorial Post Graduate College and S.D. Kanya Mahavidyalaya College, 3 Senior Secondary Schools, 90 High Schools, 1 Middle School, 1 Primary School, and one District Library and has one civil hospital, 3 Dispensaries, 1 Ayurvedic, and 4 Homeopathic dispensaries. There are two police stations i.e. PS City and PS Sadar and also a railway station. Ancient period The ancient history of the Mansa district has been traced to the Indus Valley civilization. The archaeological finds at different villages of Mansa district are almost similar to those of Harappa and Mohanjodaro. It is divided into three parts Pre-Harappa, Harappa and Late Harappa. Demographics According to the 2011 census Mansa district has a population of 769,751, roughly equal to the US state of Alaska. This gives it a ranking of 489th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 11.62%. Mansa has a sex ratio of 880 females for every 1000 males and a literacy rate of 62.8%. Agriculture and industry Mansa is situated in the cotton belt of Punjab and therefore popularly called the \\"Area of white gold\\". Indeed, agriculture forms the backbone of the district economy. Mansa is home to the largest Thermal Power Plant of Punjab. The Thermal Power Plant has the capacity to produce 1980MW of electricity Industrially, the district is very deficient, yet some trade and industry is being carried out in urban areas.

It was developed in New Zealand in the 1940s and rapidly adopted elsewhere in the 1950s. The Auster Agricola, a specialist aerial topdressing plane A PAC Cresco aircraft in action, with the fertiliser emerging from between the wings. Origins =Previous aerial applications= The first known aerial application of agricultural materials was by John Chaytor, who spread seed over a swamped valley floor in Wairoa, New Zealand, in 1906 using a hot air balloon with mobile tethers. The first known use of a heavier-than-air machine in aerial application was on 3 August 1921 when, as a result of advocacy by Dr Coad, a USAAC Curtiss JN4 Jenny piloted by John A. Macready was used to spread lead arsenate to kill catalpa sphinx caterpillars near Troy, Ohio, United States. The first commercial operations were attempted in the US in 1924 and use of insecticide and fungicide for crop dusting slowly spread in the Americas and, to a lesser extent, other nations. Crop dusting poisons enjoyed a boom in the US and Europe after World War II until the environmental impact of widespread use was recognised following the publication of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring in 1963. Crop dusting was not adopted in New Zealand until after top dressing was well established. =Early efforts= Initial interest in New Zealand concentrated on seed sowing, but much of New Zealand's central North Island farmland, given to returned servicemen after World War I, had proven deficient in trace minerals such as cobalt, copper and selenium, forcing difficult topdressing by hand in rough country, or abandoning the land for forestry. The possibility of using aircraft was soon investigated. Spreading superphosphate by agricultural aircraft was independently suggested in 1926 by two New Zealanders, John Lambert of Hunterville and Len DaniellJust turned 25 he purchased his remote Wairarapa hill-country farm in the winter of 1913. Wearing a harness supporting a hand-operated seed distributor and towing packhorses, he began re-seeding his farm. Enlisting in 1915, he watched from the trenches in France and ached for the day the bomber aircraft might instead spread seed and fertilizer on Wairere. When it became known Henry Ford had invested in the heavy cargo-carrying aircraft industry, he at once wrote to Ford pointing out this potential but never received an acknowledgment from Ford. To the irritation of the new leaders of the new aerial-topdressing industry, Len always remained an advocate of so much less accident-prone large aircraft, in particular Bristol Freighters. He believed real cargo aircraft to be properly powered and designed and built for the job. Furthermore, the industry as it developed with small aircraft required substantial farmer investment in infrastructure unnecessary for the big planes. Accordingly, he declined persistent offers of directorships of their companies, instead long maintaining hopeful watch on SAFE. of Wairere. There was some publicity when in 1936 Hawkes Bay farmer Harold McHardy used a de Havilland Gypsy Moth to sow clover seed on his own land. This led the Soil Conservation and Rivers Control Council to decide to fund aerial sowing and topdressing trials in 1937 to prevent erosion, but little progress was made, despite strong advocacy by Doug Campbell. At that time it was illegal to drop anything from an aircraft, which dissuaded several advocates who felt a law change was needed before experiments could begin. =Alan Pritchard= The idea of spreading seed also occurred to Alan Pritchard, a pilot for the New Zealand Public Works Department, as he was flying E. Madden of the Ministry of Works in a de Havilland Moth, sharing grapes and throwing the seeds out of the open cockpits. A few months later Pritchard was tasked with conducting an aerial survey in Northland. The survey was delayed when the Ministry's Miles Whitney Straight, ZK-AFH, was grounded by bad weather. A supervisor, J. L. Harrison, complained that Pritchard was holding back men needed to sow lupin seed. Remembering the grape seeds, Pritchard suggested sowing the seed by air. Burying the hatchet, Harrison and Pritchard spent that evening experimenting with methods of dispersal, before settling on sewing a sack onto a piece of downpipe. The following morning, 8 March 1939, Pritchard flew over Ninety Mile Beach while Harrison, on his signal, held the downpipe out a window and emptied the sack. They then landed and examined the spread of the seeds. It was found a distribution of 1 seed per square foot was obtained from a height of 100 to . On Monday 10 March, they sowed , using 2 lb/acre (224 kg/km2) instead of the 5 lb/acre (560 kg/km2) used when sowing by hand. The pair returned to examine the site at 2 weeks, 1 month and 2 years and at all points the aerially sown land was indistinguishable from that sown by hand. Pritchard wrote up the experiment in the NZ Journal of Agriculture (vol 70 p117-120). This came to the attention of the Minister Bob Semple, who Pritchard occasionally flew as a VIP. Semple asked how Pritchard had obtained permission. Pritchard admitted he had not, and had \\"cribbed\\" back the time in the ZK-AFH's logbooks by extending the time of other flights. Semple encouraged Pritchard to continue, adding \\"Don't let anyone catch you, and if they do, send them to me\\". After the outbreak of World War II, he had the good fortune to retain the use of ZK-AFH, when most aircraft were impressed for war service. Pritchard conducted various trials between 1939 and 1943, from an early stage adding fertiliser to the seeds, which was found to dramatically improve growth. The success of the fertiliser was such that his trials came to concentrate on this aspect, and its possible application to existing pasture. As a result of Pritchard's experiments, in 1945 the Department of Agriculture estimated aerial topdressing would cost about ¬£4 per ton of fertiliser (on a basis of 2 cwt per acre), which was economic (actually, this price turned out to be a significant overestimate). Pritchard now found an ally who could officially sanction further trials. =Doug Campbell= Doug Campbell was an agricultural academic concerned about soil erosion. He had been suggesting the spread of both seed and fertiliser for erosion control and aerial spreading of trace minerals since the 1930s, but had not conducted trials until he met Pritchard. Campbell brought official backing and academic responsibility to Pritchard's work. Immediately after the war, he obtained permission to build a sheet metal hopper for ZK-AFH to test the spread of bluestone crystals. In 1946 the first pure topdressing flight was conducted without seed. Mixtures of bluestone crystals, sulphate of ammonia, slaked lime and carbon black were used. The lack of a lid for the hopper initially resulted in irritating dust spreading through the aircraft in turbulence: in cold wet conditions it was necessary to heat the hopper to prevent the fertiliser coagulating, while in dry conditions the powder tended to disperse in the wind before reaching the ground. Nevertheless, in July Campbell arranged for ZK-AFH to topdress 1,100 acres (4.5 km2) of a copper-deficient farm. In August 1947 trials with cobalt sulphate in liquid form were conducted on the farm of K. M. Hickson near Taumarunui, with a horseback-mounted radio used to convey results to the pilot. It was soon suggested that cobaltised superphosphate would be easier to spread, although it was felt a specialised aircraft would be needed to do this. Campbell published his research in the New Zealand Journal of Science and Technology, Volume X, 1948 as \\"Some observations on top dressing in New Zealand\\". Convinced by the trials, Campbell formed the co-ordinating and advisory committee on aerial topdressing with representatives from the Ministry of Public Works, Department of Agriculture, Department of Air, DSIR and the Soil Conservation Council. At the committee's first meeting on 27 November 1947 it resolved to ask the Royal New Zealand Air Force for assistance. =RNZAF trials= Between the second world war and the cold war, the RNZAF was a large and competent organisation without a lot of work to do. It responded enthusiastically to Campbell's suggestion, initially proposing to use Tiger Moth and DC-3 aircraft, but concerns about corrosion lead them to use \\"expendable\\" war surplus Grumman Avengers. Experiments were resumed on 5 September 1948 using a Miles Whitney Straight and three Grumman Avengers; the RNZAF put superphosphate in a converted long range fuel tank in Avenger NZ2504 and dropped it over the concrete runway at Ohakea. (NZ2504 is now preserved in the Royal New Zealand Air Force Museum). The superphosphate was too powdery but a more granular form was found before final trials measuring distribution pattern of spread by air on 16 September 1948. The results were considered very promising. Trials proceeded to hill country at Te Mata near Raglan, and were extended to three other sites. Grumman Avenger used in the trials, preserved in the RNZAF Museum. For 1949 a Research and Development flight was formed under Stan Quill, equipped with the three Avengers and a Douglas DC-3, while instructions were sent to England to modify 2 RNZAF Miles Aerovans then on the production line to carry one-ton hoppers. A ground convoy of station wagon, car, one-ton truck, jeep, fuel tanker and radio van supported them. The 1948 fuel tank was replaced by a hopper with sides angled at 60¬∞ with a vibrating rod to loosen the superphosphate. Large-scale topdressing started on 14 March 1949 spreading clover-super mix. The \\"Topdress III\\" trials culminated on 21 May 1949 with a demonstration drop on 11 different properties close to Masterton in front of large numbers of farmers and press. These trials were calculated to have spread 2.5 cwt/acre (31,000 kg/km2) at an all- up cost of 15 shillings ($1.50) per acre (4047 m2), despite the use of inappropriately over-powered combat aircraft. Further public displays were given to cabinet ministers on 30 August at Johnsonville, on 9 September at Ohakea and at a 17 September Air Force Day air show. As these trials were a resounding success, in addition to the Aerovans, 12 Bristol Freighters then under construction for the RNZAF were modified to take superphosphate hoppers. Following these successful trials, in 1950, farmers' groups lobbied the government to have the RNZAF provide subsidised topdressing with the Bristol freighters and even advocated using large Handley Page Hastings. But by this time government work was being overtaken by private enterprise as ex-airforce pilots bought New Zealand-built De Havilland Tiger Moth biplanes cheaply, placed a hopper in the front seat and went into business flying from the paddocks of any farmer willing to pay. The RNZAF was waking up to the Communist threat and preferred to concentrate on defence and the government was reluctant to spend money or interfere with the increasing number of commercial operators. Research in other nations =Australia= The first experimental topdressing in Australia was done by a private Tiger Moth in 1948. =Great Britain= Faced with far greater difficulty of operating aircraft from small British farms, the British Government assumed topdressing aircraft would need to operate from an ordinary runway. Economies of scale then dictated using large aircraft, which would in turn have to fly higher. Accordingly, in 1950 the RAF conducted trials over Scottish farm land with Avro Lincoln and Avro Lancaster bombers carrying canvas trays with 5 tons of superphosphate in and paper bags designed to burst on impact. These trials were a failure due to poor spread achieved from the bags. The Bristol Aeroplane Company conducted private trials on hill country in the same year with scaled-up versions of the New Zealand hoppers fitted to Bristol Freighters. The success of these trials was widely publicised through Farmers' Weekly magazine. Hopper conversions were marketed for the Freighter and the even larger Handley Page Hastings. However low capitalisation for start up costs and the difficulties of low level operation in large transports led British private industry to use smaller machines, even though they could not operate directly from farms. Success in New Zealand James Aviation Tiger Moth at Te Papa‚ÄîNational Museum of New Zealand. Several factors lay behind the development of aerial topdressing in New Zealand. The New Zealand public service gave its employees time and resources to pursue their ideas and publish research. Many farms included hill country, where it was impossible to spread fertiliser by truck. New Zealand farms tended to be large enough to make the costs worthwhile. New Zealand farmers were well educated and enjoyed the third highest standard of living in the world. High prices for lamb, beef, and wool in the early 1950s gave farmers the extra capital. World War II had left behind cheap, war-surplus Tiger Moths and highly trained ex-air force pilots.New Zealand Historical Atlas ‚Äì McKinnon, Malcolm (Editor); David Bateman, 1997, Plate 89 The majority of the 40,000 plus New Zealanders trained by the RNZAF were aircrew. Most were sent to Europe, and served in squadrons where the ground crew were from the United Kingdom. On returning to their rural homes, many bought cheap war-surplus aircraft, particularly the Tiger Moth primary trainer, available for ¬£100. These were used for weekend flying, but also dropping fencing, feed and people into remote areas, as well as occasional aerial sowing and dropping of rabbit poison. By the end of 1949 there were five firms; Airwork had five Tiger Moths, James Aviation three, Aircraft Services three, Gisborne Aerial topdressing (which was to become Field Air) had one, and Southern Scenic Airtrips had converted an Auster. In addition Wally Harding was top dressing his own property with his private Tiger Moth. Rex Garnham started Rangitikei Air Services with one DH82 and held the first Aerial application license Within the following five years nearly 50 other companies‚Äîmostly one-man operations‚Äîjoined as competition. Collectively, they were called the 'Super men', and when amalgamation occurred it was these pioneers who came to dominate the New Zealand industry. Topdressing in rugged conditions in New Zealand =Airwork (NZ)= Since 1947, Airwork (NZ) Limited had been operating Tiger Moths for rabbit killing by spreading poisoned carrots in Canterbury. In early May 1949 Charles Brazier used ZK-ASO to spread lime. Airwork was aware that Fred \\"Popeye\\" Lucas had conducted aerial seeding as well as rabbit poisoning and discussed the possibility of dropping seeds with fertiliser (as Pritchard had done) with Ces Worrell, a grain and seed merchant. He suggested spreading superphosphate alone would be more profitable, (a suggestion he may have wished he had kept to himself‚Äîthe following year, Worrell started a rival firm, Aerial Sowing). Acting on Worral's suggestion, Airwork arranged a public demonstration on Sir Heaton Rhodes's property at Tai Tapu, south of Christchurch, on 27 May 1949. They advertised spreading superphosphate for ¬£5 per ton, and several orders came from the audience. Airwork pioneered the technique of landing on the farmer's property, loading and turning the aircraft round in three or four minutes. To save time, bulk loading from a vehicle was pioneered instead of emptying bags into the hopper. For the first drop a hurriedly converted Hupmobile was used, but this soon broke down and was replaced by a Land Rover chassis fitted with hydraulic arms. This investment was justified when Pyne Gould Guinness placed the first large contract at Christmas 1949. Airwork would go on to have a major role in the development of the Fletcher aircraft. =Fieldair= Lawson Field (1896‚Äì1981), a farmer and pilot, converted one of Gisborne Aero Club's de Havilland Tiger Moths, Barbara II, so that Ken Young could drop superphosphate during the week and the club could fly the plane at weekends. The arrangement was typical of the system adopted by all early firms; a steep sided hopper was installed in the Tiger Moth's front seat, which the pilot, by pulling a lever, opened the vent at the bottom to release its load. When the club complained the hopper could not be removed from the passenger seat without causing structural damage, Field bought Barbara II and started the Gisborne Aerial Topdressing Company on 2 August 1949. He calculated his first drop cost ¬£2.10s. per ton of fertiliser, and he was able to charge farmers ¬£5 per ton. In September 1949 he became the founding president of the New Zealand Aerial Work Operators' Association, later the Aviation Industry Association of New Zealand. In 1951 he renamed the company Fieldair Limited and brought in modern De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beavers, and in 1955 Lockheed Lodestars and DC-3s. Fieldair developed the tractor-mounted hopper loader, adopted throughout the industry, and became the largest topdressing firm in the country by the time of Field's death in 1981. Fieldair's logo is a strangled goose. According to legend, a hungry Fieldair pilot flying between airstrips saw a single goose which looked like dinner. His somewhat hopeful method was to attempt to manoeuvre alongside the bird, side slip into it and grab hold. The first few attempts failed and the goose got wise. A dogfight developed, and both fliers lost altitude. A hundred feet over a gully the goose broke towards the aircraft, and hit the prop, breaking it. The pilot force-landed, and concocted a suitable story of a bird strike, which was sadly undone when the farmer requested the company's services, as \\"You blokes must have the best pilots in the country ... one of your blokes chased this goose around my farm for about a half an hour. He must have just missed by inches every tree on my place. And to top it off this bloke succeeded in killing the goose and landed to pick it up\\". (Ewing & MacPherson, p182). =Wanganui Aero Work= Wally Harding, a pioneer Waiouru farmer, converted his Tiger Moth into a top dresser in 1949 to use on his own not particularly productive high country station. The following year he founded Wanganui Aero Work Ltd. By 1954 the company added the first PAC Fletcher to its five Tiger Moths. It also operated Beavers, Ceres, Cessna 180/185s, Piper PA-25 Pawnees, Piper Cubs and Cessna AGwagons, but eventually standardised on Fletchers for its fixed-wing fleet, purchasing eight PAC Crescos when these were introduced. In 2004 the family business was bought out by Ravensdown Fertiliser Cooperative, although two of Wally's grandsons remain in the company: Bruce, chief pilot, and Rick, operations Manager. The fleet currently consists of eight Crescos, two Fletchers, and one each Robinson R44, Bell 206B, Aerospatiale AS350, Hughes 369C and McDonnell Douglas MD520N helicopters. In 2013 Wanganui Aero Works changed from their famous red and white markings to a cleaner, white livery as a result of the buy-out by Ravensdown. =James Aviation= Ossie James was another pilot and farmer who started with a Tiger Moth salvaged from floodwaters in 1948 and progressed to owning the largest fleet of Fletchers in the country. James Aviation flew a number of Douglas DC-3s and Lockheed Model 18 Lodestars as well as Fletchers. James was heavily involved in the New Zealand International Field Days, the Salvation Army, and Waikato Aero Club. Ossie James was made a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2004. Aircraft Typical of many, pre-war Tiger Moth ZK-AIO was converted to topdressing in early 1950 and lost in a crash the same year. By 1952 there were 38 firms in the business in New Zealand, operating 149 aircraft, of which 138 were Tiger Moths. A smattering of higher powered de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beavers were the only modern types. By 1956 there were 182 aerial topdressing Tiger Moths but it was obvious the lightweight Tiger Moths would need to be replaced. At the beginning of the 1950s there were no specialist designs for even crop dusters, due to the proliferation of World War II surplus trainers. But for topdressing something larger and more robust was needed. =War surplus= Conversions of more robust World War II aircraft started. In 1954 the RNZAF had conducted some further topdressing tests at Masterton using a Bristol Freighter fitted with three 2-ton hoppers. To appease higher government command the aircraft was given a civilian registration, ZK-BEV, and hired to the private company 'Industrial Flying Limited'. These trials lead to large numbers of heavy twin-engined types, such as Douglas DC-3s and Lockheed Lodestars being converted for topdressing. The Harvard and its Australian-built counterpart the CAC Wirraway were adapted by rebuilds, the Wirraway into the CAC Ceres. Bits of Harvards were used by Luigi Pellerini to make most of the bizarre twin-tailed cockpit-over-the-engine PL-11 Airtruck. Flight tested at Te Kuiti in 1950 this aircraft not only had a long and successful career but was put into production (as an all-new-built aircraft) in Australia, the Transavia PL-12 Airtruk that also appeared in one of the Mad Max movies. =Existing designs= The DHC Beaver was purchased in numbers and there were abortive plans to build it under license in New Zealand, but its high wing and bulky cabin were unsuited to the role. In the UK Miles Aerovans proved underpowered. In the Eastern Bloc, where economy mattered less, the Antonov An-2 was used for the role. Developing specialist machines Fletcher Fu24 Entirely new designs were clearly needed in Australasia. In Britain Auster produced the Auster Agricola and Percival the Percival EP-9 for the New Zealand market. Both robust but primitive fabric- covered aircraft. In Australia the small but more advanced Yeoman Cropmaster was developed. In the United States Fletcher Aviation Corporation was persuaded by a delegation of New Zealanders to develop an aircraft for the New Zealand market and Jim Thorpe adapted a design for the FD-25 Defender light attack aircraft into the Fletcher Fu24, a stressed skin monoplane with a high lift wing. It had more than three times the load capacity of the Tiger Moth and the cockpit located well forward, ahead of the hopper, giving the pilot all round view. This‚Äîwith a few changes such as an enclosed cockpit‚Äîturned out to be the winning formula and orders soon reached three figures. Cable Price Corporation funded two prototypes with the New Zealand Meat Producers Board acting as financial guarantor‚ÄîGibson having brow-beaten a reluctant Fletcher board into building a prototype. Airparts was formed to assemble the American kits. The first prototype was flown in America in June 1954, the second in New Zealand in September 1954 and it received type approval in May 1955. A hundred Fletcher kits were delivered to New Zealand that year. Airparts bought out the rights and continued development locally. Specialist crop dusters such as the Schweizer Agcat emerged in America in the mid-1950s, designed for the flat mid-west. These generally had poorer forward vision and lesser payload to weight ratios than the Fletcher, which continued to dominate the New Zealand market‚Äîhowever, in places where aircraft primarily were used to drop insecticide, these American designs were superior. =Pacific Aerospace= The Fletcher was responsible for starting New Zealand's small aircraft building industry. Having taken over from Air Parts and AESL, Pacific Aerospace is the manufacturer of the PAC Fletcher and the similar but larger and turboprop powered PAC Cresco, as well as the PAC 750XL and PAC CT/4 Airtrainer. Pacific Aerospace of Hamilton is New Zealand's largest aircraft manufacturer. Fletchers and Crescos have been exported to Australia, Africa, the Middle East and South America. Differences between the demands of American and European markets, as well as entry barriers, have ensured the Antipodean style of topdresser did not compete with the cockpit behind the hopper designs of American manufacturers. PAC Cresco in a hard banking turn at the end of a run. Mature industry The amount of fertiliser used in aerial topdressing rose from almost nothing in 1950 to over 250,000 tons in 1955, to over 450,000 tons in 1960 and to over 900,000 tons in 1965, approximately doubling every five years. By 1958 there were 73 aerial topdressing firms in New Zealand, flying 279 aircraft‚Äîalthough the amount of superphosphate dropped and the area it fell on would continue to increase‚Äîfrom then on the numbers of companies, aircraft and pilots dropped as the larger more expensive Fletchers came to dominate the market and the one-man companies that began in the 1940s were amalgamated. By 1965 the million tons of superphospate dropped annually was being spread over 9 million acres (36,000 km2). The amount an aircraft dropped had increased from 2.5 tons to 8 tons and there were 10,000 privately owned airstrips for topdressing in New Zealand. Other work was also done by agricultural aircraft, as in foreign countries, particularly outside the February to May prime season. Clover seed is sown and spraying is carried out with insecticides, fungicides and weedkillers as well as general utility work. Aerial Topdressing has been attributed with vastly increasing agricultural production‚Äîin New Zealand alone, sheep numbers increased from 40 million to over 70 million, the majority of the increase being attributed to the increased feed that superphosphate made available. Environmental impact Limestone pinnacles remain after phosphate mining in Nauru. Ironically, given the industry was started by government research aimed at soil conservation, a number of negative impacts have emerged. The two major criticisms are the run off of fertiliser into streams and waterways which encourages marine plant growth, leading to choking of the waterways and altering the fresh water ecosystem, disadvantaging many fish, (and frustrating anglers). To minimise impact, topdressing is now prohibited within certain distances of water. The second impact is less direct. By enabling sheep to be run profitably on steep hillsides, the topdressing industry stopped reforestation of otherwise uneconomic land, contributing to the erosion it was originally designed to prevent. The mining of superphosphate from guano deposits on the tiny South Pacific island of Nauru temporarily made the island one of the richest nations in the world on a per capita basis, but removed most of the soil from the island making 80% of it unusable.

He was the son and successor of Meli≈°ipak, from whom he had previously received lands, as recorded on a kudurru,Land grant to Marduk-apla-iddina kudurru Sb 22, excavated at Susa and currently in the Louvre. and he reigned for 13 years,Kinglist A, BM 33332, ii 13. during a time when The Dark Ages cast a heavy cloud over the contemporary events. Biography He claimed, like his father, descent from Kurigalzu and evidently kept court in D≈´r-Kurigalzu itself because tablets found in the burnt ruins of the Tell-el-Abyad quarter which marked the later Elamite destruction of the city, are dated in the first two years of his reign. These include lists of garments received or distributed for the New Year, or akitu, festival and indicate a normal economic relationship with Babylonia's western and eastern neighbors, the Subarians and Elamites respectively, whose singers apparently entertained the royal household. Documents surviving from his reign date only as late as his sixth yearNamely, tablet IM 50025. and include his repair of the E-zida temple at Borsippa,VS 1, 34, VAT 4131. where he credited the god Enlil with raising him to kingship despite recording this in an inscription wholly dedicated to Marduk. There is evidence of thriving commerce in woolen garments with Assyrian traders,IM 49992. and numerous royal land grants in northern and especially northeastern Babylonia. The Chronicle of the Market PricesChronicle of Market Prices (ABC 23), BM 48498, lines 10 and 11. references his 21st year, but neither king with this name ruled longer than 13 years. Like his two predecessors, some of the economic texts show a curious double-dating formula which has yet to be satisfactorily explained. The Synchronistic King ListSynchronistic King List ii 9. gives his Assyrian contemporary as Ninurta- apal-Ekur, which is unlikely as he is also shown against the earlier two Kassite kings, despite his short reign. =Kudurrus= Detail from a kudurru of Marduk-apla-iddina I.Land grant to Marduk-zƒÅkir-≈°umi kudurru, BM 90850, published as BBSt 5. Several inscribed kudurrus, or boundary stones, survive which document large donations of land and tax exemptions during his reign. Marduk-zƒÅkir-≈°umi, the bƒìl pƒ´·∏´ati, or provincial governor, was the beneficiary of a piece of land as a perquisite from the king. He was son of Nab√ª-nadin- a·∏´e, grandson of Rimeni-Marduk, great grandson of Uballissu-Marduk, who had been ≈°atammu, or an official under Kurigalzu II‚Äôs regime and descendant of Arad-Ea, um-mi-a-niƒü2-kas7, scholar of accounting. His responsibilities included inspector of temple and land and controller of forced labor. One of the witnesses was Nab√ª-≈°akin-≈°umi, also described as ‚Äúson of‚Äù Arad-Ea. Another stele records that Ina-Esaƒüila-zƒìra-ibni, ‚Äúson of‚Äù Arad-Ea, measured a field, after replacing the previous land surveyor. The symbol of the stylus, representing the god of writing and wisdom, Nab√ª, makes its first appearance on one of his kudurrus. A kudurru comes with an unusual trinity of gods in its invocation of a divine curse,dAG dNa-na-a √π dTa≈°-me-tum bƒìlƒì ≈°ip·π≠i u puruss√™ ana lemutti lis·∏´ur≈´≈° ana la ·π≠ƒÅbti [li≈°]te'u≈°. ‚ÄúMay Nab√ª, Nanaya and Ta≈°mƒìtum, lords of the decrees and decisions, surround him with evil and search him out for misfortune.‚Äù The continuity of the reign with those earlier in the dynasty is evident in a kudurru providing confirmation of an earlier land grant by Adad-≈°uma-u·π£urAdad-bƒìl-kala kudurru AS 6035 (Sb 169) published as MDP VI 42. and a copy of a kudurruKudurru of Nazi-Marutta≈°, Sb 21, published as MDP II 86. from the reign of Nazi-Marutta≈°, the original of which was destroyed when a wall collapsed on it. Kudurrus were also used to record legal settlements, and two examples include a lawsuitLand grant to Munnabittu kudurru, Sb 26, published as MDP VI 31. concerning land in ·∏™udadu (Baghdad?) province, on the Elamite border east of the Tigris from his accession year, and oneKudurru of Marduk-apla-iddina, Sb 33 (AS 6018), published as MDP 6 39. recording legal actions over a field. =List of kudurrus dated to this reign= Around eighteen kudurrus could be assigned to his reign based upon the art-history of their iconography. The following lists those which actually identify him as the monarch in their texts. * Land grant to Marduk-zƒÅkir-≈°umi kudurru, the bƒìl pƒ´·∏´ati * Land grant to Munnabittu kudurru * Uzbi-Enlil kudurruUzbi-Enlil kudurru, IM 67953, published as Sumer 23 (1967) 45‚Äì67, pl. 1‚Äì6. * Broken kudurru of Marduk-apla-iddina * Adad-bƒìl-kala kudurru confirming a gift by the earlier king Adad-≈°uma-u·π£ur * Fragmentary kudurru of Marduk-apla-iddinaKudurru of Marduk-apla-iddina, NBC 9502, partially published as Hallo & Simpson (1988) 100, fig. 21. * The Tehran kudurruTehran kudurru, published as Borger AfO 23 (1970) 1‚Äì11. Also dated to his reign is the stone copy of the Nazimarutta≈° kudurru stone. =End of his reign= The events at the end of his reign are uncertain, but it is clear from later sources that it ended dramatically, when Elamite troops led by Shutruk-Nahhunte, who had married a sister of Marduk- apla-iddina, invaded Babylonia and sacked several cities, including the capital. Whether these events were the cause of his demise, or whether they followed a succession crisis in which Zababa-≈°uma-iddina, an individual whose relationship with Marduk-apla-iddina is unknown, attempted to succeed him to the kingship, has yet to be determined. The Prophecy AProphecy A, tablet VAT 10179, KAR 421. text may portray him in the figure of the 4th king, whose 13-year reign ends with an Elamite attack on Akkad, the booty of Akkad taken away, confusion, social disorder, usurpation and famine, events which seem to mirror much of what is known about this period.

LGBT newspaper Metro Weekly, a 2003 profile in The New York Times by Tour√©, and a feature in The Advocate. prominent hip-hop figures took interest and began to endorse Caushun publicly. In a 2007 interview in Allhiphop.com, Ivan Matias revealed that he created Caushun and that he wrote, recorded and performed all of the work attributed to Caushun. Matias revealed that the Caushun persona started out as a prank when he and friends called into the STAR & BUC WILD SHOW on HOT 97 WQHT radio station in New York as a flamboyantly gay rapper. After a series of call-in performances that became increasing popular, Matias agreed to meet with radio host STAR aka Troi Torain at Hot97, where he explained the situation. Together, they decided that Caushun needed a face as the popularity and demand for the character grew. Matias contacted Jason Herndon who agreed to play the role of Caushun in public.

It has been described either as a member of Western Pahari, a group of languages mostly spoken to the west in Himachal Pradesh, or as a dialect of Garhwali, a Central Pahari language. It shares between one half and two thirds of its basic vocabulary with neighbouring varieties of Garhwali and with the Western Pahari languages of Jaunsari and Sirmauri.  Centum substrate hypothesis  Bangani is of interest amongst scholars of Indo-European languages, due to some unusual features. Since the 1980s, Claus Peter Zoller ‚Äì a scholar of Indian linguistics and literature ‚Äì has claimed that there is a centum language substrate in Bangani. Zoller has also suggested that Bangani has been misclassified as a dialect of Garhwali and is more closely related to the Western Pahari languages. The substance of Zoller's claims has been rejected by George van Driem and Suhnu Sharma, in publications since 1996, which claim that Zoller's data was flawed and that Bangani is an unambiguously satem language. Zoller does not accept the findings by van Driem and Sharma, citing methodological issues and outright falsities in van Driem and Sharma's work. Support for Zoller's hypothesis and his underlying data has been offered by other linguists and Indologists, such as Anvita Abbi, Hans Henrich Hock,Hans Henrich Hock & Elena Bashir, 2016, The Languages and Linguistics of South Asia: A Comprehensive Guide, Berlin/Boston, Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, p. 9n. and Koenraad Elst.See, for example, Koenraad Elst, 2007, Asterisk in BhƒÅropƒ´yasthƒÅn: Minor Writings on the Aryan Invasion Debate, Delhi, Voice of India, p. 31.

He, Sean Yates and Tony Doyle finished seventh. Elliott's breakthrough came at the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane where he first took gold in the team time trial and then again in the 184 kilometre road race by outsprinting Steve Bauer, Roger Sumich, Steve Lawrence and Russell Harrington. 1983 was Elliott's final year as an amateur and he took six stages of the Milk Race and was also third overall in the Circuit des Ardennes before turning professional with Raleigh- Weinmann in 1984. Further domestic success followed in 1984 and 1985 before switching to the ANC‚ÄìHalfords Cycling Team for the 1987 season, alongside Graham Jones, Paul Watson and Joey McLoughlin. Professional career ANC‚ÄìHalfords raced on the continent as well as in Britain. Elliott finished third in the 1987 Amstel Gold Race. The team received an invitation to the 1987 Tour de France with Elliott finishing 94th overall and third on the stage into Bordeaux. In 1988 Elliott joined the Fagor team, led by Stephen Roche. Elliott took his first stage in the Vuelta a Espa√±a that year and another two in 1989, by which time he had switched to the Spanish Teka team riding alongside fellow British rider Darryl Webster. He rode in Europe until the end of 1992 when he signed for the American team, Chevrolet‚ÄìLA Sheriffs. Elliott had many wins for Chevrolet, winning the First Union Grand Prix in 1993 and 1994 and the Redlands Classic in 1993 and 1994, and two stage wins in the Tour DuPont in 1993 and 1995. In 1996 he was then selected for the Olympic Games road race, but finished a disappointing seventy ninth. The race was won by Pascal Richard. In 1997 he moved to Comptel‚ÄìColorado Cyclist but the team hit financial trouble. That led Elliott to retire at the end of 1997 aged 36. =Comeback= Elliott in the Jersey Town Criterium 2009 in Saint Helier Elliott returned at the start of 2003 at 41. Riding as an individual for the Pinarello-Assos squad (set up by his former manager at ANC‚ÄìHalfords, Phil Griffiths), he won in the Havant International GP and stages in the Irish Milk Ras. In 2004, he won the season long Premier Calendar, and the National Elite Circuit Series. For 2006 Elliott signed for Plowman Craven team and again won the National Elite Circuit Series. On 24 August 2006 in St. Johann, Austria, he became UCI road masters world champion. In 2007 he won the UCI 1.2 ranked International CiCle Classic, and the Shay Elliott Memorial, the Irish one-day classic. In 2009 he was inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame. For the 2010 season, Elliott raced with the newly launched Motorpoint Pro-Cycling Team. The ten-strong team, based in Stone in Staffordshire, saw Elliott managed by Keith Lambert and the team run by Phil Griffiths. The team competed in such high-profile races as the Tour of Britain and 'UK Tour Series' ‚Äì the city centre-based cycling race series broadcast on TV, in which Elliott won the Durham round and the Motorpoint team took overall honours. On 16 May 2010 he set the record for completing the Etape du Dales sportive in 5 hours and 43 minutes. He left the roster after the 2011 season, but remained with the team as a sporting director. Doping In 1992 Elliott failed a dope test on stages 3 and 5 of the Tour of Andalucia, testing positive for nandrolone, an anabolic steroid. As the two tests were so close this was treated as a single infraction and he was stripped of the win on stage 3.

These terms are usually coupled, sometimes with additional terms, to indicate more details of the woman's obstetric history. When using these terms: * Gravida indicates the number of times a woman is or has been pregnant, regardless of the pregnancy outcome. A current pregnancy, if any, is included in this count. Multiple pregnancy is counted as 1. * Parity, or \\"para\\", indicates the number of pregnancies reaching viable gestational age (including live births and stillbirths). The number of fetuses does not determine the parity. Twin pregnancy carried to viable gestational age is counted as 1. * Abortus is the number of pregnancies that were lost for any reason, including induced abortions or miscarriages. The abortus term is sometimes dropped when no pregnancies have been lost. Stillbirths are not included. Gravidity in humans In human medicine, \\"gravidity\\" refers to the number of times a woman has been pregnant, regardless of whether the pregnancies were interrupted or resulted in a live birth. * The term \\"gravida\\" can be used to refer to a pregnant woman. * A \\"nulligravida\\" is a woman who has never been pregnant. * A \\"primigravida\\" is a woman who is pregnant for the first time or has been pregnant one time. * A \\"multigravida\\" or \\"secundigravida\\" is a woman who has been pregnant more than one time. Terms such as \\"gravida 0\\", referring to a nulligravida, \\"gravida 1\\" for a primigravida, and so on, can also be used. The term \\"elderly primigravida\\" has also been used to refer to a woman in their first pregnancy, who is at least 35 years old. Advanced maternal age can be a risk factor for some birth defects. Gravidity in biology In biology, the term \\"gravid\\" ( \\"burdened, heavy\\"Oxford English Dictionary) is used to describe the condition of an animal (most commonly fish or reptiles) when carrying eggs internally. For example, Astatotilapia burtoni females can transform between reproductive states, one of which is gravid, and the other non-gravid. In entomology it describes a mated female insect. Parity Parity is the number of pregnancies >20 weeks (duration varies from region to region, 20 - 28 weeks, depending upon age of viability). A woman who has never carried a pregnancy beyond 20 weeks is nulliparous and is called a nullipara or para 0.F. Gary Cunningham, 2005. Williams Obstetrics, 22nd Edition, McGraw-Hill Companies. A woman who has given birth once before is primiparous and is referred to as a primipara or primip. A woman who has given birth two, three, or four times is multiparous and is called a multip. Grand multipara describes the condition of having given birth five or more times. Like gravidity, parity may also be counted. A woman who has given birth one or more times can also be referred to as para 1, para 2, para 3, and so on. Viable gestational age varies from region to region. In agriculture, parity is a factor in productivity in domestic animals kept for milk production. Animals that have given birth once are described as \\"primiparous\\"; those that have given birth more than once are described as \\"pluriparous\\".Mehrzad J, Duchateau L, Py√∂r√§l√§ S, Burvenich C. (2002). Blood and milk neutrophil chemiluminescence and viability in primiparous and pluriparous dairy cows during late pregnancy, around parturition and early lactation. Journal of Dairy Science \\"85\\" (12): 3268-76.D. Vecchio, G. Neglia, M. Rendina, M. Marchiello, A. Balestrieri, R. Di Palo (2007). Dietary influence on primiparous and pluriparous buffalo fertility. Italian Journal of Animal Science \\"6\\" (Suppl. 1): 512‚Äì514. Those that have given birth twice may also be described as \\"secondiparous\\", in which case \\"pluriparous\\" is applied to those that have given birth three times or more. =Nulliparity= A nulliparous () woman (a nullipara or para 0) has never given birth. It includes women who have experienced spontaneous miscarriages and induced abortions before the mid-point of pregnancy, but not women who have experienced pregnancy loss after 20 weeks. Prolonged nulliparity () is a risk factor for breast cancer. For instance, a meta- analysis of 8 population-based studies in the Nordic countries found that never giving birth was associated with a 30% increase in the risk of breast cancer compared with women who have given birth, and for every 2 births, the risk was reduced by about 16%. Women having their first birth after the age of 35 years had a 40% increased risk compared to those with a first birth before the age of 20 years. Recording systems A number of systems are incorporated into a woman's obstetric history to record the number of past pregnancies and pregnancies carried to viable age. These include: * The gravida/para/abortus (GPA) system, or sometimes just gravida/para (GP), is one such shorthand. For example, the obstetric history of a woman who has had two pregnancies (both of which resulted in live births) would be noted as G2P2. The obstetric history of a woman who has had four pregnancies, one of which was a miscarriage before 20 weeks, would be noted in the GPA system as G4P3A1 and in the GP system as G4P3. The obstetric history of a woman who has had one pregnancy of twins with successful outcomes would be noted as G1P1+1. * TPAL is one of the methods to provide a quick overview of a person's obstetric history.http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/obgyne/tools.pdf In TPAL, the T refers to term births (after 37 weeks' gestation), the P refers to premature births, the A refers to abortions, and the L refers to living children. When reported, the \\"abortions\\" number refers to the total number of spontaneous or induced abortions and miscarriages, including ectopic pregnancies, prior to 20 weeks. If a fetus is aborted after 20 weeks, spontaneously or electively, then it is counted as a premature birth and P will increase but L will not. The TPAL is described by numbers separated by hyphens. Multiple births (twins, triplets and higher multiples) count as one pregnancy (gravidity) and as one birth. For example, a pregnant woman who carried one pregnancy to term with a surviving infant; carried one pregnancy to 35 weeks with surviving twins; carried one pregnancy to 9 weeks as an ectopic (tubal) pregnancy; and has three living children would have a TPAL annotation of T1, P1, A1, L3. This could also be written as 1-1-1-3. * The term GTPAL is used when the TPAL is prefixed with gravidity, and GTPALM when GTPAL is followed by number of multiple pregnancies. For example, the gravidity and parity of a woman who has given birth at term once and has had one miscarriage at 12 weeks would be recorded as G2 T1 P0 A1 L1. This notation is not standardized and can lead to misinterpretations. Though similar, GPA should not be confused with the TPAL system, the latter of which may be used to provide information about the number of miscarriages, preterm births, and live births by dropping the \\"A\\" from \\"GPA\\" and including four separate numbers after the \\"P\\", as in G5P3114. This TPAL form indicates five pregnancies, with three term births, one preterm birth, one induced abortion or miscarriage, and four living children. Criticism In humans, it can lead to some ambiguity for events occurring between 20 and 24 weeks, and for multiple pregnancies.

He was one of the most significant spiritual figures in Hinduism during the 20th century. He was known to be a Jivanmukta (Sanskrit for one liberated while alive).Sages of Sringeri, A Tattvaloka Publication, Shri Sharada Peetham, Shringeri, 2005. Biography Chandrashekhara Bharati SwaminahHindu peethadipathis (peethadipathis are heads of Hindu Mathas) are addressed respectfully as Swaminah or Mahaswami or Jagadguru. In this article, the same convention is followed was born to pious parents in Sringeri on Ashvayuja Shukla Ekadashi (the eleventh day of the bright fortnight in the month of Ashvayuja) in the Hindu lunar year Nandana (corresponding to October 16, 1892). His father was Gopala Sastri and mother, Lakshmamma. He was the last of 12 children born to this couple and the only one who survived past infancy. A notable feature of his life was that his birth, upanayanam, sannyasa and videha mukti (death), all happened on Sundays. =Childhood days= The childhood days of Narasimha Sastri (as he was named by his parents) were passed in Sringeri. He was an introvert and had little attraction for the objects of the world. He was lodged in the house of Srikanta Sastri, the then administrator of the Sringeri Matha. His parents performed the Choodakarma (a rite performed as one of the sixteen sa·πÉskƒÅras that enables one to go to school). He was then sent to the local Anglo-vernacular school run by the government. His Brahmopadesha was performed when he was eight. He was regular in the performance of Sandhyavandanam three times a day, and Agnikarya, twice a day. Narasimha, after his twelfth year, changed over to Sadvidya Sanjivini Pathasala in Sringeri under the express wishes of Jagadguru Sri Sacchidananda Shivabhinava Narasimha Bharati Swaminah, the then head of the matha. The Jagadguru kept a close watch over the progress of his ward. =Higher studies at Bangalore= The then Acharya of the Sringeri Matha had established in 1910 an institution of higher Vedantic training- Bharatiya Girvana Prouda Vidya Vardhini Shala in Bangalore. Narasimha Sastri was chosen to be a disciple at that institution. Narasimha Sastri moved to Bangalore in 1911 with his parents and plunged into his studies. Mahamahopadhyaya Mahamahopadhyaya is a title acquired by Sanskrit Pundits after completing their studies Vellore Subrahmanya Sastri and Mimamsa Shiromani Vaidyanatha Sastri taught him Purva Mimamsa by texts such as the Bhatta Dipika. Mahamahopadhyaya Virupaksha Sastri taught him Vedanta. Even in Bangalore there was no change in Narasimha's inwardness. He spent his free time in the peaceful environs of the Gavigangadhareshwara Temple in Gavipuram, Bangalore. =Taking Sannyasa= In 1912, Acharya Sacchidananda Shivabhinava Narasimha Bharati Swaminah decided to name Narasimha Sastri as his successor to the Sharada Peetham. A devotee, Rama Sastri, was entrusted with the task of personally carrying the Acharya's letter carrying the naming of his successor to the Peetham to Krishnaraja Wodeyar, Maharaja of Mysore. Before Narasimha could arrive in Sringeri, the Acharya had attained Videha Mukti. So, on April 7, 1912, Narasimha Sastri was initiated into Sannyasa by Sri Satyananda Sarasvati Mahaswami and given the yoga patta The name one receives after taking Sannyasa (ascetic vows) in Hinduism of Chandrashekhara Bharati. He received the saffron robes, the sacred staff and the kamandalu (water pot) from the Mahaswami. He was thus ordained in the dashanami tradition of Sri Adishankaracharya. =Kumbhabhishekam and Digvijayam= In 1916, the Kumbhabhishekam (consecration) of the Sharada Temple in Sringeri was performed by Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswami. In 1924, he left Sringeri on his first Digvijayam (tour). He first reached Mysore and consecrated a temple at the house of his Guru. It was named Abhinava Shankaralaya. Then, from Mysore, the Mahaswami proceeded to Satyamangalam via Nanjanagud and Chamrajanagar. He then toured the southern parts of the Tamil country including Thirunelveli and Kanyakumari. He then toured Thiruvananthapuram and Kaladi in Travancore. At Kaladi, in 1927 he established a Vedanta Pathashala (an institution for higher studies in Vedanta). He then returned to Sringeri after visiting a few more places in Karnataka and Travancore. =Avadhuta Sthiti and naming his successor= After returning to Sringeri, the Mahaswami assumed the Avadhuta Sthiti (the state of being an Avadhuta). He was absorbed in the inward bliss of the Atma. To enable himself to spend more time in meditation and contemplation of the Self, he named a successor to the Peetham: a boy named Srinivasa Sastri. On May 22, 1931, he initiated Srinivasa Sastri into Sannyasa and gave him the yoga patta of Abhinava Vidyatirtha. In 1938, he undertook a yatra (pilgrimage) to Bangalore, Mysore and Kaladi. After returning to Sringeri, he resumed his classes on Vedanta and wrote thought-provoking and erudite articles in Asthikamathasanjeevini,a journal published by the Matha. He granted interviews to genuine seekers and gave darshan to the public. =Final years and Videha Mukti= After 1945, the Mahaswami gradually withdrew from all activities. However, his fame had spread far and wide. On August 24, 1954, the first President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, visited Sringeri to pay homage to the Jagadguru. The President, a pious man having deep faith in the Hindu scriptures, discussed with the Mahaswami on Dharma and other allied subjects. On September 26, 1954 (the day of the Mahalaya Amavasya festival), the Mahaswami took a bath in the Tunga River, which ran in Sringeri. Afterwards, he sat in padmasana posture and attained Videha Mukti on the banks of the river. His body was discovered floating in the river. His assistant Ramaswami jumped in the water and with the help of Kehavachari brought the body to the shore. The Jagadguru's body was then interred In the Hindu tradition, bodies of Sannyasis are buried whereas, those of non- Sannyasis are cremated or buried depending on the family custom by Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha, his successor to the Sharada Peetham. His body was buried beside his Guru's samadhi (shrine) and a samadhi was constructed for him. A Shiva Linga was consecrated over it. It is worshipped today and is called Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati Linga. After the videha mukti of Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswami, another shrine was constructed and the Mahaswami was buried there beside Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswami's shrine.

A right-handed batsman and right-arm fast-medium pace swing bowler, Johnson made his first-class debut as a teenager in the 1992 County Championship as an opening bowler for Middlesex. He made headlines in 1994 when he took all ten Derbyshire wickets in their second-innings, returning figures of 10/45. He moved to Somerset in 2001, and made his Test debut two years later. He played three Tests and ten One Day Internationals (ODIs) for England in 2003, his only year of international cricket. He announced his retirement from first-class cricket in October 2007, aged 32.  Career  =International recognition= Johnson's first taste of international cricket came during the 1992‚Äì93 Coca-Cola International Youth Cricket Challenge in South Africa, where he represented England Under-18s, alongside fellow future Test cricketers Marcus Trescothick and Vikram Solanki. The following winter, he toured Sri Lanka with England Under-19s, playing one youth Test and three youth One Day Internationals. He claimed three wickets in each innings of his Test appearance, including that of Mahela Jayawardene, and followed this up with four wickets in the ODI series, finishing the tournament with a bowling average of 14.16 from his Test and 16.50 from the ODI series. After his ten- wicket haul against Derbyshire, Johnson was named as part of the England A squad to tour India and Bangladesh in the winter of 1994‚Äì95. Johnson's Test career began in impressive fashion, as he claimed six wickets in the first- innings of his debut against Zimbabwe in June 2003. Although he remained wicket-less in the second-innings, Johnson received the man of the match award. His figures were the sixth best by an Englishman on Test debut. His One Day International debut came later in the same month as part of the 2003 NatWest Series against Zimbabwe and South Africa. Opening the bowling alongside Darren Gough, he claimed three wickets as Zimbabwe won with two overs to spare. He went wicket-less in two matches against South Africa before claiming another two Zimbabwean wickets in the following match. Following the return of James Anderson, Johnson was no longer opening the bowling, instead being used as first-change bowler. A five-man pace attack bowled Zimbabwe out for just 92, and despite four wickets from Heath Streak, England won the match in just 17.5 overs. He claimed his first non-Zimbabwean wicket in the penultimate match of the competition, having Jacques Kallis caught, following it up two overs later with the wicket of Andrew Hall. Another wicket in the final meant that Johnson finished the tournament with eight wickets for a respectable bowling average of 22.12. A knee injury prevented Johnson from playing in the following Test series against South Africa. Despite his performance on debut, Johnson was not picked as part of the England Test squad to tour Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. However, when Anderson was ruled out with a knee injury, Johnson cancelled his honeymoon and an injury to Steve Harmison in the first Test saw him selected for the second. He responded by becoming the first English bowler since Nick Cook in 1983 to take five-wicket hauls in his first two Tests. He finished with match figures of 9/93, and was once again rewarded by being named man of the match. In the subsequent ODIs, Johnson claimed three wickets in the second match after remaining wicket-less in the first. Johnson's third, and final, Test appearance came in the first Test against Sri Lanka in December 2003. He claimed a solitary wicket, that of Kumar Sangakkara. England opted to replace Hoggard and Johnson with a sixth batsman and James Kirtley for the second Test, with both bowlers receiving criticism for lacking the variety needed on a flat track at Galle.

The film stars Robert Redford, Jennifer Lopez, and Morgan Freeman. It is the story of a gruff Wyoming rancher (Redford) who must reconcile his relationship with his struggling daughter-in-law (Lopez) and previously-unknown-to-him granddaughter, after they show up unexpectedly at his ranch and ask to stay with him and his disabled best friend and neighbor (Freeman). Plot One year ago, a bear stole a calf from Mitch (Morgan Freeman) and Einar‚Äôs (Robert Redford) ranch. The two friends attempted to save the calf, but the bear viciously attacked Mitch ‚Äî and because Einar was drunk, he failed to save Mitch from serious injury. The bear escaped into the mountains. A year later, Mitch‚Äôs wounds still cause him constant pain. Einar cares for Mitch daily, giving him morphine injections, food, and friendship. He leans his guilt on emotional crutches, while Mitch struggles to walk with real crutches. The bear is later seen foraging for food in town. Sheriff Crane Curtis (Josh Lucas) captures it and it ends up in the town zoo. About the same time, Einar‚Äôs long- lost daughter-in-law Jean (Jennifer Lopez) shows up on his doorstep, trying to escape an abuser. Jean and her daughter, Griff (Becca Gardner), move in with Einar and Mitch. Einar‚Äôs son, Griffin, had married Jean years ago. She discovered that she was pregnant with Griff after Griffin died in a car accident, after which the family broke up. Tension exists between Einar and Jean, as both are still grieving for Griffin; tensions build as Einar has always blamed Jean for his son's death. Since Griffin died, Jean has been in a series of unsuccessful relationships. She moved in with Einar to escape her latest abusive boyfriend, Gary (Damian Lewis). Jean starts working at a local coffee shop to earn money to become independent. There she befriends Nina, another waitress (Camryn Manheim). The local sheriff also becomes her friend. Meanwhile, Gary has tracked Jean down and appears in town. Initially, Einar and the sheriff throw him out of town. Einar asks Jean to tell him how Griffin died. Jean says they flipped a coin to determine who would drive, and she lost. At 3 a.m., the two tired souls had set out on the last leg of a long trip. Jean fell asleep at the wheel. The car flipped six times. Griffin died, but Jean survived. When Einar learns the truth about his son's death, he says they‚Äôll have to talk about Jean moving out. Jean says she‚Äôs through talking. The next morning she takes Griff with her and leaves to stay with Nina, who ends up helping her understand Einar‚Äôs gruff ways and bitterness. Griff, who has begun to build a relationship with her grandfather, leaves her mother and goes back to the ranch alone. Einar meets Jean at the diner and invites her to come back and live with him after he and Griff go on a camping trip. The \\"camping trip\\" is a cover story meant to allow them time to carry out a request from Mitch to set free the bear who mauled him. The plan to get the bear into a transport cage does not go well. Griff accidentally knocks the gearshift lever into neutral while Einar is luring the bear into the cage. The bear gets free, and Einar gets injured as he jumps out of the way. Griff drives Einar to the hospital, where he and Jean attempt to reconcile. Back at the ranch, Mitch survives a peaceful confrontation with the bear from his past. It goes into the mountains, where it belongs. Meanwhile, Gary returns to the area and comes to the ranch the next day to accost Jean. He and Einar have an explosive confrontation that ends in Einar threatening Gary with his rifle, before badly beating him up. We later see Gary, battered, on a Trailways bus as it moves through Nebraska. In the final scene, Einar affectionately talks with one of his cats, who throughout the whole story he'd coldly ignored. Griff invites Sheriff Curtis for lunch when he drops by to see Jean (previously Griff, knowing of her mother fooling around with Sheriff, had told him not to stay for lunch). All is well as Mitch narrates the last seconds of the story, describing to Einar his dreams of flying above the earth and coming to understand things about life.

The museum is a central part of a larger consortium of 18 museum units in nine municipalities with the county of Nordland. Background The museum was established in 1888 as the Bod√∏ Fisheries Museum (Bod√∏ Fiskerimuseum). The majority of the museum's collections were destroyed during World War II when the museum was hit by two bombs on May 27, 1940. The museum building was also stripped of its function as a museum during the war, when it housed the Nasjonal Samling, a Norwegian fascist party active from 1933 to 1945. The museum has since regained its function as a museum and houses today several exhibitions that cover Northern Norwegian culture and history. Collections The main building was designed by engineer Ole Aarnseth and built in 1903. The museum building has been preserved by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage. The museum houses an interactive dry fish aquarium exhibition from the mid 1950s, which has also been persevered by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage. On the first floor the museum has two exhibits: one about the Lofoten fisheries and the international stockfish trade with the Hanseatic League, and a second covering the local Sami people. Most of the Sami material on display is from Tysfjord, north of Bod√∏. The exhibition on the second floor shows a silver treasure from the Viking Era. This treasure was found in Bod√∏ in 1919 and is one of the biggest that has been found in Northern Norway. The treasure consists of silver jewellery and silver pieces, among them Anglo- Saxon and Arabic coins. The largest silver piece, a silver decorative needle for fastening capes, was part of a larger international exhibition. Vikings: Life and Legend was a collaboration between the British Museum, the National Museum of Denmark and the Berlin State Museums which focused on the core period of the Vikings from the late 8th century to the early 11th century. The third floor shows an exhibit about the history of Bod√∏ from the founding in 1816 to the present. Central to the exhibit is the destruction of the old town during the German occupation of Norway, a dramatic highpoint in the town history. The exhibition also contains a 25-minute documentary with English subtitles about the town's older history (1816-1940).

He found himself at Varna in the summer of 1854, when the English and French armies were encamped there, either as a mere visitor and colonel unattached, as Kinglake says, or in command of the battalion of Coldstream guards, when his promotion to the rank of major general was gazetted on 20 June 1854. As a general officer on the spot, he was requested by Lord Raglan to take command of the 1st Brigade of the Light Division, consisting of the 7th, 23rd, and 33rd regiments, which had become vacant owing to the promotion of Brigadier General Richard Airey to be quartermaster-general in the place of Lord de Ros. As a general commanding a brigade and absolutely without experience of war, Codrington went into action in his first battle, the Battle of Alma. The light division got too far ahead and fell into confusion in crossing the Alma, and Codrington, seeing that his men could not lie still and be slaughtered by the Russian guns, boldly charged the great redoubt and carried it. But he had soon to fall back before the weight of the Russian column, and ran a risk of being utterly crushed, until the Russian column was broken by the charge of the highland brigade under Sir Colin Campbell. His bravery in this battle showed that Codrington deserved his command, and he again proved his courage at the battle of Inkerman, where he occupied the Victoria Ridge throughout the day, and perpetually sent off all the troops who came up to his help to assist in the real battle on the Inkerman tusk. Sir George Brown, who commanded the light division, was severely wounded in this battle, and after it Codrington assumed the command of the whole division as senior brigadier. Throughout the winter of 1854‚Äì55 he remained in command of the division, and on 5 July 1855 he received the reward of his constancy by being made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. Codrington arranged with General Edwin Markham, commanding the 2nd Division, the attack on the Redan of 8 September, but blame seems to have been showered more freely on Sir James Simpson, who commanded in chief since Lord Raglan's death, than on the actual contrivers of that fatal attack. On 11 November 1855, for some reason that has never been properly explained, Codrington succeeded Sir James Simpson as Commander-in-Chief instead of Sir Colin Campbell, who had much better claims to the succession, and he commanded the force occupying Sebastopol, for there was no more fighting, until the final evacuation of the Crimea on 12 July 1856. On his return to England, Codrington was promoted lieutenant general, appointed colonel of the 54th Foot, and in 1857 was elected MP for Greenwich, in the liberal interest. From 1859 to 1865, he was Governor of Gibraltar. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the latter year, and was promoted general in 1863. In 1860, he was transferred to the colonelcy of the 23rd Foot, and in 1875 to that of the Coldstream guards, the regiment in which he had risen. He remained an active politician to the end of his life, and contested Westminster in 1874, and Lewes in 1880, in the liberal interest. He saw no active service except in 1854 and 1855. He wore a medal and four clasps for the Crimea, and was a Commander of the Legion of Honour, a Knight Grand Cross of the Military Order of Savoy, and a member of the first class of Order of the Medjidie. Codrington died on 6 August 1884, in his eightieth year, at Danmore Cottage, Heckfield, Winchfield in Hampshire. Political career In politics, Codrington was a Liberal supporter of Viscount Palmerston. He particularly liked his leader's foreign policy. He was in favour of \\"progressive reform\\" and \\"civil and religious liberty\\", but did not support the secret ballot. He was Member of Parliament for Greenwich between a by-election in February 1857 and 1859. He contested Westminster in 1874 and Lewes in 1880. In 1868 he stood for the seat of Greenwich, replacing fellow Liberal Sir William Bright who had declined to stand. When William Gladstone failed to take the seat of Lancashire, Codrington himself stood aside to allow him to represent Greenwich. [Kentish Mercury, 12 September 1868.] Family In 1836 he married Mary Ames and together they went on to have two sons and two daughters. His son, Alfred, also joined the Army, commanding a Home Service army during the First World War; his daughter Mary married William Earle, an Army officer killed commanding the forces the Battle of Kirbekan. The other two children died young. References ;Attribution Sources * Who's Who of British Members of Parliament: Volume I 1832‚Äì1885, edited by M.

He was known also as an improving landlord, philanthropist and writer.  Life and career  He was born in Edinburgh 5 April 1739. His father Willam Forbes, heir to a Nova Scotia baronetcy, was an advocate; the family estate at Monymusk in Aberdeenshire, had been sold by his grandfather. Forbes's maternal grandmother was a sister of Lord Pitsligo, whose activities in 1745 led to the forfeiture of his estate, also in Aberdeenshire. His mother, Christian Forbes, was a member of a collateral branch of the Monymusk family, and was left a widow when William, the elder of two surviving boys from a family of five, was only four years old. She settled in Aberdeen in 1745 for the education of her children, who were brought up as Scottish episcopalians. The younger boy died in 1749, and in October 1753 Lady Forbes, with her surviving son, settled in Edinburgh. A friend of the family, Sir Francis Farquharson of Haughton, arranged with Messrs. Coutts, a prominent firm of bankers in Edinburgh, to admit Forbes as an apprentice, and he entered their service in 1754. It was run by the sons of John Coutts. The apprenticeship lasted four years, and then he was clerk in the counting-house for two years more, at the end of which he was given a small share in the business as a partner. In 1761 John Coutts, the principal partner of the Edinburgh firm, died, leaving none of the sons of John Coutts the elder in a position to run it. A new partnership, including Forbes, was proposed and established in 1763. After seven years (in 1770) he married Elizabeth Hay, eldest daughter of Sir James Hay of Smithfield, bart. His mother died in 1789. Late Sir Will.m Forbes Bar.t - print made by John Kay (1806) From 1763 to 1773 the active members of the firm, still under the original name, were Sir Robert Herries, Forbes, and James Hunter. The name Coutts was retained till 1773, when a new contract was made, and the firm became Forbes, Hunter, & Co., Sir William Herries having settled in London to conduct in St. James's Street the business later known as Herries & Co. Forbes now was the head of the firm, and decided to confine the transactions of the house to banking alone. The house became one of the most trusted in Scotland, and remained stable in the financial crises and panics of 1772, 1788, and 1793. In 1783 the firm, after difficult preliminaries, began to issue notes. Forbes had become an authority on finance, and in 1783 he took part in preparing the revised Bankruptcy Act. William Pitt used to consult him, and adopted in 1790 some of his suggestions on the stamps on bills of exchange. In 1799 Pitt offered him an Irish peerage, which he declined. The company in 1838 became the Union Bank of Scotland. Forbes worked to win back some of the alienated possessions of his ancestors. Lord Pitsligo's only son, the Hon. John Forbes, had bought Pitsligo. William Forbes bought some of the upper barony (the lower barony had passed by purchase to a stranger), and on the death of John Forbes he succeeded in 1781 to the whole. He improved the estate and laid out the village of New Pitsligo in 1783. In that year he was one of the co-founders of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Forbes was also involved in philanthropic projects in Edinburgh: the High School, the Merchant Company, the Morningside Lunatic Asylum, and the Blind Asylum. Forbes and his business partner Hunter Blair supported the construction of the South Bridge. He also succeeded in giving the Scottish episcopalians a surer standing in Edinburgh. Archibald Alison was brought to the city at his suggestion, and in Alison's works there is a funeral sermon to his memory. The grave of Sir William Forbes of Pitsligo, Greyfriars Kirkyard Forbes declined invitations to stand for parliament. He was a member of Samuel Johnson's literary dining club, and he is mentioned in James Boswell's Tour to the Hebrides. Lady Forbes, with whom he made his only lengthy visit to the continent in 1792‚Äì3, died in 1802. He died at 39 George Street in Edinburgh on 12 November 1806. He is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard in the vault immediately east of MacKenzie's domed tomb on the south side. The vault was built at the height of the graverobbing fears in Edinburgh and demonstrates the design art of \\"secure burial\\". Works His long friendship with the poet James Beattie enabled him to produce An Account of the Life and Writings of James Beattie, LL.D., including many of his Original Letters. This appeared in two quarto volumes in 1806, and was republished in three octavo volumes the following year. Forbes had written before this the tribute to his mother, which remained in manuscript till 1875, another portion of the same manuscript, not hitherto printed, being devoted to the memory of his wife. In the Narrative of the last Sickness and Death of Dame Christian Forbes, 1875, Forbes paid tribute to his mother. He was also author of \\"Memoirs of a Banking-House\\" in 1803.  Children  On 20 September 1770 Forbes married Elizabeth Hay (died 26 December 1789), daughter of Sir James Hay of Haystoun, 4th Baronet of Smithfield and Dorriel Campbell. They had thirteen children: # Sir William Forbes, 7th Baronet of Pitsligo (21 December 1773 ‚Äì 10 October 1828) # Christian Forbes, daughter, (6 June 1775 ‚Äì 1863), who married Sir Alexander Wood # John Hay Forbes, Lord Medwyn (19 September 1776 ‚Äì 25 July 1854) # James Forbes (9 April 1778) # Rebecca Forbes, daughter, (24 Dec 1779‚Äì1826) who married Alexander Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry # Elizabeth Forbes, daughter, (2 March 1781 ‚Äì 1840), who married Colin Mackenzie of Portmore WS FRSE.

It is included in the 2017‚Äì21 National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems as a regional general aviation airport. It had 1,800 enplanements in 2014. Facilities Salinas Municipal Airport covers and has two asphalt runways: 8/26 is 6,004 x 150 ft. (1,830 x 46 m), and 13/31 is 4,825 x 150 ft. (1,471 x 46 m). It has one helipad, 90 x 90 ft. (27 x 27 m) asphalt/concrete. In the year ending June 30, 2007 the airport had 77,896 aircraft operations, average 213 per day: 97% general aviation, 2% air taxi and 1% military. 229 aircraft were then based at this airport: 70% single-engine, 21% multi-engine, 3% jet and 6% helicopter. History A first airport was proposed by members of the local American Legion post. With city support, it was established in the summer of 1928 and was called Salinas American Legion Airport, later known simply as Legion Field. It was located near the current American Legion Post #31 and the runway ran parallel to West Laurel Drive. Commercial service was available as early as 1933 via Pacific Seaboard Air Lines on twice-daily flights between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Legion Field closed shortly after the current airfield was turned over to civilian control following the end of the Second World War. The current airfield opened in late 1941 as Salinas Army Air Field (AAF). It was used by the United States Army Air Forces Fourth Air Force as a subpost to Fort Ord during the war. Its mission was that of an incoming personnel processing center and a training field for Army pilots in reconnaissance and observation duties in various aircraft from light observation planes to medium bombers. The Air Transport Command also used the field and had an air freight terminal here for transshipment of cargo. =Reconnaissance units= Initially, IV Air Support Command used Salinas as a training base for photo-reconnaissance units. The 69th Observation Group arrived at the base in October 1941 equipped with a variety of O-38, O-46, O-47 and O-52 light aircraft which were also used in conjunction with Army ground forces at Fort Ord in their maneuvers. The 69th moved to San Bernardino AAF in Southern California after the Pearl Harbor Attack in December and engaged in anti-submarine patrols. The 71st Observation Group replaced the 69th in December 1941, moving in from Third Air Force at Birmingham Airport, Alabama. The 71st was equipped with a similar mixture of observation aircraft and engaged in anti-submarine patrols over the Central California coast until August. The group was temporarily assigned to the Army Desert Training Center at Rice AAF in the Mojave Desert in August, training with General George Patton's forces prior to the Operation Torch invasion of North Africa in November. It moved back to Salinas in October 1942, and trained with Fort Ord units. It was reassigned back to Third Air Force, moving to Esler Field, Louisiana in January 1943 where it served as the observation unit for Army forces training at Fort Polk. The last observation group at Salinas was the 70th Observation Group, being moved from Second Air Force in Washington. It continued the anti-submarine and support observation mission at Fort Ord until August, when it was reassigned back to Second Air Force at Redmond AAF, Oregon. =P-38 Lightning training= In September, the field was transferred to IV Fighter Command, which assigned the 360th Fighter Group as a P-38 Lightning Replacement Training Unit (RTU). The 360th trained replacement pilots on the Lightning with the 371st, 372d, 373d and 446th Fighter Squadrons as its operational squadrons. =P-61 Black Widow training= The move of the Army Air Forces Night Fighter School to Hammer Field, California dictated the move of the 360th Fighter Group to Santa Maria AAF in January 1944. Its designation was also changed from an Army Airfield to Salinas Army Air Base. Salinas was used as an auxiliary airfield by the 481st Night Fighter Operational Training Group (NFOTG) at Hammer Field, and moved a combination of modified Douglas A-20 Havocs for night fighter operations, designated P-70, and brand-new prototype YP-61 Black Widow purpose-built night fighters. The 548th Night Fighter Squadron was formed at Salinas in April 1944. Like all of the Night Fighter squadrons being trained by IV Fighter Command, it moved among several bases in the San Joaquin Valley. Flights of P-61s from the 426th, 427th, 547th, 549th and 550th Night Fighter Squadrons moved in and out of Salinas AAF during 1944 as part of their training prior to being deployed to combat units, primarily in the Pacific and CBI theaters. In December 1944 the 481st NFOTG was inactivated as part of an AAF reorganization. It was essentially re-designated as the 451st Army Air Forces Base Unit, and instead of training squadrons, it became a Replacement Pilot Training (RTU) organization which sent pilots overseas to established Night Fighter Squadrons. The 451st was made up of a number of lettered squadrons, which were expressed as the 451st AAFBU (A Squadron), and so on. These replacement training squadrons operated at the same airfields as was used by the 481st NFOG in the San Joaquin Valley. The 451st was under the operational control of the IV Fighter Command 319th Wing, headquartered at Hammer Field. The 451st AAFBU concluded its training of replacement pilots in May 1945 and operations at the airfield were phased down to a standby status. With the end of the war, the base was declared excess to requirements and returned to civil control. =Commercial service= Salinas Municipal Airport has been without commercial service since 1962, when United Airlines ended its daily Convair service. As late as 1961, United was offering once-daily stops both northbound and southbound between San Francisco and Los Angeles with intermittent stops in Monterey and Santa Barbara. California International Airshow Salinas Airport is the location of the annual California International Airshow, set at various times during the year. The air show often features top-tier aerobatic teams such as the Canadian Forces Snowbirds, U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds and the U.S. Navy Blue Angels, with the proceeds going to local charities.

He was later a long-serving Member of Parliament. Life Evans was born in 1787, in Moig, County Limerick, Ireland. Educated at Woolwich Academy he followed his elder brother Richard (1782‚Äì1847) into the military, joining the East India Company's forces in 1800 before volunteering for the British Army in India in 1806. He obtained an ensigncy in the 22nd Regiment of Foot in 1807 then exchanged into the 3rd Light Dragoons in order to take part in the Peninsular War. He was sent on the expedition to the United States of 1814 during the War of 1812 under Major General Robert Ross. Evans was quartermaster general to Ross at the Battle of Bladensburg on 24 August 1814, and during the Burning of Washington, as well as at the Battle of North Point on 12 September 1814, where Ross was killed. Evans photographed in 1855 Evans was actively involved in the New Orleans campaign at the conclusion of the War of 1812. He was the only British Army officer present at the Royal Navy 'small boat action' on Lake Borgne, and was wounded at the battle of New Orleans. Returning to the European war with the restoration of Emperor Napoleon I, Evans was present at the battle of Quatre Bras on 16 June 1815 and the battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815. Evans commanded the British Legion, which volunteered to assist Isabella II of Spain in the First Carlist War. During the Crimean War he commanded the 2nd Division of the British Army. In 1853 he was given the colonelcy for life of the 21st Regiment of Foot (Royal North British Fusiliers) and promoted full general on 10 March 1861. He served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Rye in 1830, and from 1831 to 1832, and for Westminster from 1833 to 1841 and from 1846 to 1865. He was also awarded the Grand Cross of the French Legion of Honour.A dictionary of general biography: with a classified and chronological index of the principal names, William Leist Readwin Cates, page 44 In 1854, Evans was appointed to command the 2nd Division at the start of the Crimean war, and fought at the Battle of the Alma. Around the time of the Battle of Inkerman, he was sick, so Major General John Pennefather was in command of the division. He was later invalided home. Beginning in the middle 1850s Evans became a strong advocate for reform of the British army. In particular he was harshly critical of the system by which British army officers purchased their commissions and were expected to pay for each rank of promotion. While he did not live to see the final abolition of the purchase system which occurred in 1871, his persistent call for amelioration was instrumental in its ultimate demise. Evans died on 9 January 1870, and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London. Portraits of Evans were painted by Peter Edward Stroehling (above) and Richard Buckner. An engraving based on the latter can be seen on the web site of the British Library, London. The original life-size Buckner portrait was rediscovered in 2012 and was authenticated by art historian Philip Mould on the BBC Antiques Road Show at Cheltenham in 2013.

The studios and offices are in suburban Fremont and the transmitter is in nearby Hayward near the San Mateo‚ÄìHayward Bridge. KFAX broadcasts with 50,000 watts, the highest power permitted for AM stations. But because 1100 AM is a clear- channel frequency reserved for Class A WTAM in Cleveland, KFAX must use a directional antenna to avoid interference, aiming most of its signal away from the east. The station is the most powerful Christian-formatted AM station west of the Mississippi.  History  = As KJBS = The station now assigned the KFAX call letters was first licensed in 1925 as KFUQ, and made its first broadcast on January 3, 1925. Its five-watt radio transmitter provided an advertising gimmick for Julius Brunton & Sons, operators of an automobile service station and local distributor of Willard Storage Batteries, which were popularly used in both experimental transmitters and receivers during radio's early days. Shortly after making its debut, KFUQ became KJBS. The station's first address was 1380 Bush Street, a building which remains an auto-service facility today. In its early years, the station broadcast police dispatch calls, amongst its regular schedule, in the days before police departments could afford their own radio transmitters. In 1927, KJBS's power was increased to fifty watts, and on March 1, 1928, its power was increased to 100 watts. On April 5, 1929, the station's frequency was changed to 1070 kHz. On April 19, 1930 KJBS debuted its Owl program, signing on at midnight. In the mid-1930s, its power was increased to 500 watts. In the 1940s in order to increase its range of coverage, KJBS was assigned to 1100 kHz, sharing time with the dominant station in North America on 1100 kHz, which was in Cleveland. This required that KJBS go off the air at local sunset, but allowed it to come back on the air when Cleveland signed off at 1:00 a.m. in the East, 10:00 p.m. local time. By this time, KJBS had moved to 1470 Pine Street, a building incorporating a stand-alone vertical transmitting tower at the front entrance to the building. In 1959 KJBS was granted a construction permit to increase its daytime power to 50,000 watts.\\"Government notes\\", Broadcasting. July 27, 1959. p. 76. Retrieved August 30, 2019. This change in broadcasting power required the station to operate one of the most distinctive schedules in the history of broadcasting. It operated from a directional set of 4 towers in the suburban town of Hayward from 6:00 a.m until local sunset, then from the Pine Street 1,000 watt transmitter from 10:00 p.m. until 3:00 a.m. (when Cleveland's WTAM would come back on the air, at 6:00 a.m. Eastern time). During the summer, this meant that KFAX was off the air for only 1.5 hours (8:30 sunset until 10:00 p.m.). =As KFAX= Logo as an all-news station In 1960, KJBS was sold to Argonaut Broadcasting for $425,000.\\"Changing Hands\\", Broadcasting.

Trivia  In light of a radio often being the first electrical device in a home not connected to centrally generated electric power, both the Cleveland- based Willard Storage Battery Company and a local outlet for Willard Batteries founded and owned stations in the early 1920s, as with WTAM in Cleveland (9 months' ownership) and KJBS (apparently for several decades). In this case, however, these two stations with an early link began in 1941 sharing clear channel use of the 1100 kHz frequency.

Selfridge Jr. Memorial to Thomas O. Selfridge, Jr., Vicksburg National Military Park. Thomas Oliver Selfridge Jr. (February 6, 1836 ‚Äì February 4, 1924), son of Rear Admiral Thomas O. Selfridge, was an officer in the United States Navy. Early life Born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, Selfridge graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1854. He was the first officer to receive a diploma from the Academy. Civil War At the beginning of the American Civil War, he helped with efforts to destroy the untenable Norfolk Navy Yard; and he then escaped from that burning and beleaguered base in the USS Cumberland, helping to save the sloop of war for the Union Navy. He participated in the capture of the Hatteras forts and was on board Cumberland on 8 March 1862 when she was sunk by Confederate ironclad, CSS Virginia. He then briefly commanded USS Monitor, after Lieutenant John L. Worden was wounded; and then commanded the USS Alligator, an experimental submarine, in testing operations based at the Washington Navy Yard. In August, he joined the Mississippi Squadron, and subsequently commanded the USS Cairo and the USS Conestoga when those ships were sunk in action. Late in the war, he returned to the Atlantic where he commanded the USS Huron in the attacks on Fort Fisher; and he participated in the ensuing bombardment of Fort Anderson and the capture of Wilmington, North Carolina. Postwar His postwar service included command of USS Nipsic, USS Enterprise, and USS Omaha ‚Äì the last two on the Asiatic Station. He was promoted to captain in 1881. While in command of the Omaha in 1887, Selfridge conducted target practice off the coast of the Japanese island of Ikeshima which resulted in the deaths of four Japanese and the wounding of seven others. This created an international incident and Selfridge was acquitted at a court martial in 1888. In 1885, Captain Selfridge, of the U. S. man-of-war Omaha, delegated a lieutenant to present his compliments to Captain De Saune, the French commander of the Is√®re, laden with the Statue of Liberty, and suggest that Gravesend Bay would be a safer anchorage than the Sandy Hook Horseshoe. He was promoted to commodore in 1894 and then had duty as Commander in Chief of the European Squadron from 1895 to 1898. While commanding the European Squadron his flagship was the cruiser USS San Francisco. He was promoted to rear admiral in 1896, which made he and his father the first father and son to be admirals in the United States Navy. His nephew, Thomas Etholen Selfridge, a US Army Field Artillery officer and one of the first pilots in the nascent Army Air Service, became the first person ever to die in the crash of a powered airplane in 1908. Rear Admiral Selfridge retired on February 6, 1898 and died from heart disease in Washington, D.C. on February 4, 1924. Like his father, he was a Veteran Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and an Honorary Hereditary Companion of the Military Order of Foreign Wars. He was also a Chevalier of the French Legion of Honor. Namesake ships USS Selfridge (DD-320) was named for the elder Rear Admiral Selfridge, while USS Selfridge (DD-357) was named for both officers.

It is a two-dimensional wavelet transform which provides multiresolution, sparse representation, and useful characterization of the structure of an image. Further, it purveys a high degree of shift-invariance in its magnitude, which was investigated in. However, a drawback to this transform is that it exhibits 2^{d} (where d is the dimension of the signal being transformed) redundancy compared to a separable (DWT). The use of complex wavelets in image processing was originally set up in 1995 by J.M. Lina and L. Gagnon in the framework of the Daubechies orthogonal filters banks . It was then generalized in 1997 by Prof. Nick Kingsbury of Cambridge University. In the area of computer vision, by exploiting the concept of visual contexts, one can quickly focus on candidate regions, where objects of interest may be found, and then compute additional features through the CWT for those regions only. These additional features, while not necessary for global regions, are useful in accurate detection and recognition of smaller objects. Similarly, the CWT may be applied to detect the activated voxels of cortex and additionally the temporal independent component analysis (tICA) may be utilized to extract the underlying independent sources whose number is determined by Bayesian information criterion .  Dual-tree complex wavelet transform  The Dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) calculates the complex transform of a signal using two separate DWT decompositions (tree a and tree b). If the filters used in one are specifically designed different from those in the other it is possible for one DWT to produce the real coefficients and the other the imaginary. Block diagram for a 3-level DTCWT This redundancy of two provides extra information for analysis but at the expense of extra computational power. It also provides approximate shift-invariance (unlike the DWT) yet still allows perfect reconstruction of the signal. The design of the filters is particularly important for the transform to occur correctly and the necessary characteristics are: * The low-pass filters in the two trees must differ by half a sample period * Reconstruction filters are the reverse of analysis * All filters from the same orthonormal set * Tree a filters are the reverse of tree b filters * Both trees have the same frequency response See also * Wavelet series * Continuous wavelet transform  References  External links * An MPhil thesis: Complex wavelet transforms and their applications * CWT for EMG analysis * A paper on DTCWT * Another full paper * 3-D DT MRI data visualization * Multidimensional, mapping-based complex wavelet transforms * Image Analysis Using a Dual-Tree M-band Wavelet Transform (2006), preprint, Caroline Chaux, Laurent Duval, Jean-Christophe Pesquet * Noise covariance properties in dual-tree wavelet decompositions (2007), preprint, Caroline Chaux, Laurent Duval, Jean-Christophe Pesquet * A nonlinear Stein based estimator for multichannel image denoising (2007), preprint, Caroline Chaux, Laurent Duval, Amel Benazza-Benyahia, Jean-Christophe Pesquet * Caroline Chaux website (M-band dual-tree wavelets) * Laurent Duval website (M-band dual-tree wavelets) * James E.

The retarded time is the time when the field began to propagate from the point where it was emitted to an observer. The term \\"retarded\\" is used in this context (and the literature) in the sense of propagation delays. Retarded and advanced times Position vectors r and r‚Ä≤ used in the calculation. The calculation of the retarded time tr or t‚Ä≤ is nothing more than a simple \\"speed-distance-time\\" calculation for EM fields. If the EM field is radiated at position vector r‚Ä≤ (within the source charge distribution), and an observer at position r measures the EM field at time t, the time delay for the field to travel from the charge distribution to the observer is r ‚àí r‚Ä≤/c, so subtracting this delay from the observer's time t gives the time when the field actually began to propagate - the retarded time, t‚Ä≤.Electromagnetism (2nd Edition), I.S.

Corresponding to retarded and advanced times are retarded and advanced potentials.McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B. Parker, 1994,  Retarded position  The retarded position can be obtained from the current position of a particle by subtracting the distance it has travelled in the lapse from the retarded time to the current time. For an inertial particle, this position can be obtained by solving this equation: :\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r'} = \\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r_c}+\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r'}}{c}\\\\mathbf{v} Where rc is the current position of the source charge distribution and v its velocity. Application Perhaps surprisingly - electromagnetic fields and forces acting on charges depend on their history, not their mutual separation.Classical Mechanics, T.W.B. Kibble, European Physics Series, McGraw-Hill (UK), 1973, The calculation of the electromagnetic fields at a present time includes integrals of charge density œÅ(r', tr) and current density J(r', tr) using the retarded times and source positions. The quantity is prominent in electrodynamics, electromagnetic radiation theory, and in Wheeler‚ÄìFeynman absorber theory, since the history of the charge distribution affects the fields at later times.

This action is called subculturing or passaging the cells. Subculture is used to prolong the life and/or expand the number of cells or microorganisms in the culture. Role Cell lines and microorganisms cannot be held in culture indefinitely due to the gradual rise in toxic metabolites, use of nutrients and increase in cell number due to growth. Subculture is therefore used to produce a new culture with a lower density of cells than the originating culture, fresh nutrients and no toxic metabolites allowing continued growth of the cells without risk of cell death. Subculture is important for both proliferating (e.g. a microorganism like E. coli) and non-proliferating (e.g. terminally differentiated white blood cells) cells. Typically, subculture is from a culture of a certain volume into fresh growth medium of equal volume, this allows long-term maintenance of the cell line. Subculture into a larger volume of growth medium is used when wanting to increase the number of cells for, for example, use in an industrial process or scientific experiment. Passage number It is often important to record the approximate number of divisions cells have had in culture by recording the number of passages or subcultures. In the case of plant tissue cells somaclonal variation may arise over long periods in culture. Similarly in mammalian cell lines chromosomal aberrations have a tendency to increase over time. For microorganisms there is a tendency to adapt to culture conditions, which is rarely precisely like the microorganism's natural environment, which can alter their biology. Protocols for passaging The protocol for subculturing cells depends heavily on the properties of the cells involved. =Non-adherent cells= Many cell types, in particular, many microorganisms, grow in solution and not attached to a surface. These cell types can be subcultured by simply taking a small volume of the parent culture and diluting it in fresh growth medium. Cell density in these cultures is normally measured in cells per milliliter for large eukaryotic cells, or as optical density for 600nm light for smaller cells like bacteria. The cells will often have a preferred range of densities for optimal growth and subculture will normally try to keep the cells in this range. =Adherent cells= Adherent cells, for example many mammalian cell lines, grow attached to a surface such as the bottom of the culture flask. These cell types have to be detached from the surface before they can be subcultured. For adherent cells cell density is normally measured in terms of confluency, the percentage of the growth surface covered by cells. The cells will often have a preferred range of confluencies for optimal growth, for example a mammalian cell line like HeLa or Raw 264.7 generally prefer confluencies over 10% but under 100%, and subculture will normally try to keep the cells in this range. For subculture cells may be detached by one of several methods including trypsin treatment to break down the proteins responsible for surface adherence, chelating calcium ions with EDTA which disrupts some protein adherence mechanisms, or mechanical methods like repeated washing or use of a cell scraper. The detached cells are then resuspended in fresh growth medium and allowed to settle back onto their growth surface.

In the late 18th century he became an art dealer and collector in association with Frenchman . The pair were commissioned by Polish king Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski to compile a collection of paintings, which they spent five years doing, but Stanis≈Çaw's exile in 1795 meant the contract could not be completed and they were left with a large collection of paintings. Bourgeois outlived Desenfans and bequeathed the art to Dulwich College with an additional ¬£2000 to build a permanent building to house it. This became the Dulwich Picture Gallery, England's first purpose-built public art gallery. Biography Bourgeois was born in London in November 1753 (or, according to Royal Academy records, in 1756). He was the son of Isaac Emanuel Bourgeois, a prosperous emigre Swiss watchmaker, and Elizabeth Bourgeois (n√©e Gordon or Garden). He had a sister. In 1768, when he was fifteen, his mother died and he and his sister were abandoned by their father. Some time afterward he was taken into the protection of Noel Joseph Desenfans, a writer who had come from France to Britain in 1769. Bourgeois studied painting as a pupil of Philip James de Loutherbourg. In 1776, at the age of 23, Bourgeois made a tour of Europe. When in Warsaw he met bishop Michal Jerzy Poniatowski, primate of Poland and brother of the Polish king, Stanislaw II. Francis Bourgeois and No√´l Desenfans The sealed coffin of Sir Peter Bourgeois, Dulwich Art Gallery In the same year, his protector Noel Desenfans married Margaret Morris, an heiress and sister of the Swansea industrialist, John Morris. By the 1780s Margaret and Noel Desenfans were collecting pictures and discreetly dealing. Bourgeois lived with them at their house in Charlotte (now Hallam) Street, London. In December 1787 Bourgeois was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy and was elected a full member on 11 February 1793, when he donated a landscape painting as his diploma work. In 1791 Bourgeois's friend, Michal Poniatowski visited London to commission Bourgeois to paint a portrait of the king Stanislaw (now in Dulwich Picture Gallery). For this Bourgeois was presented with the Polish medal \\"Merentibus\\", for which George III allowed him to use the title of 'Sir' in Britain. While in London Poniatowski asked Noel and Margaret Desenfans and Bourgeois to assemble a royal collection for Poland. During the next five years, Bourgeois joined Margaret and Noel Desenfans touring Europe and buying pictures and continued his own painting In 1794 he was appointed landscape-painter to George III. The collection assembled for King Stanislaw included works by Vernet, Rembrandt, Veronese, and others. In 1795 Desenfans was appointed Polish consul general in London, but a few months later Stanislaw was forced to abdicate and the dealers were left with the collection. Their attempts to sell it to Alexander I of Russia or the British Government proved unsuccessful and in 1799 Desenfans published a PlanN. J. Desenfans, A Plan, Preceded By A Short Review Of The Fine Arts, To Preserve Among Us, And To Transmit To Posterity, The Portraits Of The Most Distinguished Characters ... Also, To give Encouragement to British Artists, and to enrich and adorn London with some Galleries of Pictures, Statues ... Without any Expence to Government (1799) for establishing some national galleries in Britain, of which the collection might form a basis, and in 1802 he exhibited the collection in London with a sale Catalogue.A Descriptive Catalogue (With Remarks And Anecdotes Never Before Published In English) Of Some Pictures Of The Different Schools, Purchased For His Majesty The Late King Of Poland; Which will be exhibited early in 1802 ... By Noel Desenfans ... (2nd. ed., 2 vols. 1802) The collection remained unsold. Bourgeois shared the Desenfans' wish that the collection should be exhibited publicly, and when he died in 1811 he left it to Dulwich College with ¬£10,000 to build a public gallery. Dulwich Picture Gallery - one of the first public art galleries anywhere in Britain was founded. The gallery was designed by Sir John Soane, who also designed the attached mausoleum, in which Bourgeois, Margaret Desenfans and N√∂el Desenfans rest in sealed coffins (visible on request). His death was indirectly caused by a horse riding accident and came about when he refused to have his leg amputated and dismissed his physician. His body was later entombed in the Mausoleum of Dulwich Picture Gallery. A portrait of Bourgeois by William Beechey is in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery and another by James Northcote is at the Dulwich Picture Gallery. George Dance the Younger made a pencil portrait of him, and he is included in H. Singleton's The Royal Academicians in general assembly 1795 (at the Royal Academy of Arts, London). Family members of Francis Bourgeois included Victor H. Bourgeois (1864-1935) and Louise Forget-Bourgeois (1830-1914). Paintings * Paysage Anglais, huile signe P.F.

However, due to the fame of the characters, he continued to voice Zippy and George in guest appearances on television in series such as The Weakest Link and TV Burp until his death. As well as providing the iconic Rainbow voices, Skelton also voiced several Doctor Who villains including the Daleks, Cybermen and the Krotons. He started performing the Daleks in 1967 (continuing the role from fellow voice actor Peter Hawkins whom he also replaced as Zippy on Rainbow) and notably performed in the Doctor Who specials The Five Doctors and The Curse of Fatal Death. In 2002, he guest-starred in Sarah Jane Smith: Test Of Nerve, an audio drama produced by Big Finish Productions.

Sir Frederick Cavendish Ponsonby (6 July 178311 January 1837) was an Anglo-Irish military officer. Early life and education Ponsonby was the second of three sons of Frederick Ponsonby, Viscount Dungannon (who succeeded as the 3rd Earl of Bessborough in 1793) and Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough. He was the brother of John Ponsonby, 4th Earl of Bessborough and William Ponsonby, 1st Baron de Mauley, and his sister was the \\"notorious\\" Lady Caroline Lamb, who married the Prime Minister Viscount Melbourne. He was educated at Harrow. Early career Ponsonby joined the army as a cornet in January 1800, serving in the 10th Light Dragoons. He was promoted lieutenant in June 1800 and Captain on 20 August 1803. He exchanged to the 60th Regiment of Foot in April 1806 and served on the staff of the Duke of Bedford, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Promoted major on 25 June 1807, he went into the 23rd Light Dragoons on 6 August 1809 and went with them to serve in the Peninsular War. He fought well at Talavera. He was promoted lieutenant colonel on 15 March 1810, and served as assistant adjutant-general at Bu√ßaco and Barrosa, directing a successful charge by a squadron of the 2nd Regiment of Hussars (KGL) against the French dragoons. He was given command of the 12th Light Dragoons on 11 June 1811. After the fall of Badajoz, he distinguished himself in the battle of Villagarcia (or Llerena) on 11 April 1812, temporarily commanding Anson's brigade. Ordered by Sir Stapleton Cotton to detain a superior force of French cavalry under Charles Lallemand, he successfully delayed them until reinforcements could arrive to flank the French and pursue them into Llerena. He led the 12th Light Dragoons to disperse some of the broken French infantry after the Battle of Salamanca, and was wounded while covering the withdrawal from Burgos. At Vitoria, his regiment was part of the force, under Sir Thomas Graham, that blocked the French retreat towards Bayonne. He took part in the Battle of the Pyrenees and the fighting that followed in the south of France, bringing to Wellington the news that Napoleon had abdicated. Waterloo Campaign During the Waterloo Campaign, the 12th Light Dragoons were attached to Sir John Ormsby Vandeleur's light cavalry brigade. At the Battle of Waterloo, the 12th and 16th Light Dragoons were told to charge down the slope, but no further, to support the withdrawal of the Union Brigade of heavy cavalry. But, like the Union Brigade (led by his second cousin, William Ponsonby), the light horse charged (as he later admitted) too far. Ponsonby was wounded in both arms, and knocked off his horse by another sabre cut. A French lancer saw him move where he lay and stabbed him in the back with his lance, exclaiming \\"Tu n'es pas mort, coquin\\" (You're not dead, you rascal). A French skirmisher then robbed him but luckily for Ponsonby, a Major de Laussat of the French Imperial Guard Dragoons found him and treated him kindly, giving him some brandy and promising to send help should the French prove victorious. Later, another French skirmisher used Ponsonby as a shield as he talked with him and fired over his body. Toward the end of the battle, he was ridden over by Prussian cavalry. During the night after the battle, he was roughed up by a Prussian looking for plunder, and a mortally wounded soldier of the Royal Dragoons had crawled upon Ponsonby's legs and lay dying. At last, Ponsonby was discovered by a soldier of the 40th Foot, who stood guard over him during the night. The next morning he was carried away in a cart, to a surgeon who tended to his seven major wounds. Despite his wounds, he was bled of over two days but nevertheless survived. He convalesced under the supervision of his sister Lady Caroline Lamb who nursed him back to health. Later career Plinth of Ponsonby's Column, a monumental column erected in Valletta in 1838. The column was destroyed by lightning in 1864, and only the plinth survives today. Ponsonby went on half-pay on 26 August 1820, and was appointed \\"inspecting field officer\\" in the Ionian Islands on 20 January 1824. On 27 May 1825, he was promoted major-general, commanding the troops in the Ionian Islands. The next year, on 22 December 1826, he was appointed Governor of Malta, and remained there for eight and a half years. He met Baron de Laussat, his saviour at Waterloo, in 1827. During his Maltese tenure, he was made GCMG in 1828, and KCB and KCH in 1831. He left the governorship in May 1835 (but remained the de jure Governor until 30 September 1836), and was appointed colonel of the 86th Regiment of Foot on 4 December 1835. He was transferred to the colonelcy of the Royal Dragoons on 31 March 1836. During this period, he maintained a high degree of interest in the handling of cavalry, and corresponded with Wellington. He died suddenly at an inn, The Wellesley Arms at Murrell Green near Basingstoke on 11January 1837 and was buried in the crypt of St Nicholas' Church, Hatherop, Gloucestershire.

He was born in Nava de la Asunci√≥nJaime Gil de Biedma, veinte a√±os despu√©s from www.diariodejerez.es 15 January 2010 on November 13, 1929. He stopped writing poetry some ten years before his death. He insisted that the character he had invented, the poet Jaime Gil de Biedma, as opposed to the respectable bourgeois businessman of the same name, had nothing left to say and he refused to go on playing the role of a poet in literary society. He died on January 8, 1990, of complications due to AIDS.Jaime Gil de Biedma, veinte a√±os despu√©s from www.diariodejerez.es 15 January 2010 English influence Among his readers, he is considered one of the most consummate Anglophiles in the field of contemporary peninsular literature. This Anglophilia was initiated when he first read T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets (translated in 1952). He was also a considerable Francophile as befitted a young Spaniard of his elevated social class, bearing in mind that Spanish society had always been notoriously 'afrancesada' until well into the 20th century. This state of affairs begin to change under the influence of poets like Gil de Biedma and Luis Cernuda. His lifelong adherence to and assimilation of Anglo-American culture was consolidated by his studies in Oxford in 1953 where he read T. S. Eliot for the first time in English (along with W. H. Auden and Stephen Spender), thus beginning a lifelong fascination with the work of the Anglo-American poet. Moreover, the long periods spent in the largely Anglophone circles of Manila would also contribute to his Anglophile literary sensibility and on numerous occasions he would declare England to be his 'segunda patria', his second country, and would also say that he was 'in great measure, a product of the Anglo-Saxon literary tradition. Even though, also shows conscious relations with Spanish and French tradition. Generation of '50 Poetically, Gil de Biedma belongs to the group of poets known as the \\"Generation of '50\\", a loose term referring to poets who come from the cultivated social realism in the wake of the Civil War. While earlier post-war poets focus strongly on social issues and lack attention to the poem itself, poets from Generation of '50 as Gil de Biedma, √Ångel Gonz√°lez, Jos√© √Ångel Valente or Francisco Brines, while still concerned with democracy or class struggle, are aware about the literary character of their work. They all introduced in Spain, partly because of the late Cernuda's influence, what Langbaum called poetry of experience', the main poetic trend in Spain from the 1980s. In their writings from 1950 to 1970, at least, they all tried to rearrange intellectually immediate experience, by the means of a fictional-self. Common topics In his early poems, he displays a strong criticism of Spanish dictatorship, titling his first important publication Compa√±eros de viaje, after a Trotskyist expression for Communist sympathizers. Gil de Biedma was known for his hard-partying ways and his unrepentant social life, and addressed the schism between public and private personae in several famous poems, arguably the most well-known being 'Contra Jaime Gil de Biedma' ('Against Jaime Gil de Biedma') or 'Despu√©s de la muerte de Jaime Gil de Biedma' ('After the death of Jaime Gil de Biedma'). Along with Francisco Brines, he helped to reinvigorate homoerotic topics on poetry, probably inspired by the exiled Luis Cernuda. Homosexuality As a homosexual in a strongly conservative environment, Jaime Gil de Biedma was forced to lead a double life for most of his life, and he suffered discrimination and even blackmail at different times. He was rejected for membership of the then illegal Spanish Communist Party, allegedly because Franco's dictatorship could use his sexuality to threaten him if he were discovered to be a communist. Living in Franco's Spain, being part of a conservative family and holding an important position in the Compa√±√≠a General de Tabacos de Filipinas, Gil de Biedma smartly played a two-faced game: in the eyes of his family and the general public he was an discreet and respectable executive, while in the company of close friends and peers he was openly gay, quick-witted and with a sharp tongue. In many ways his poetry was a reflection of this duality, for while it very directly address themes of love, sex and the routine of romance, the gender of the loved one is never disclosed. Referring to Gil de Biedma's poetry as \\"gay poetry\\" is a gross misconception. Even at the end of his life he was adamant about keeping it neutral: in the late 80s a journalist contacted Gil de Biedma to let him know he was doing an analysis of his poetry from the point of view of gay literature. Learning this Gil de Biedma was terrible distressed and went to great lengths to make sure the journalist didn't go through with his plans. Personal life Gil de Biedma's niece is the liberal conservative politician Esperanza Aguirre Gil de Biedma, former president of the Autonomous Community of Madrid and one of the main policy-makers in the Partido Popular, Spain's most important liberal- conservative party.

He saved Alexander's life at the Battle of the Granicus in 334 BC and was killed by him in a drunken quarrel six years later. Cleitus was the son of Dropidas (who was the son of Critias) and brother of Alexander's nurse, Lanike. He would be given the epithet 'the Black' to distinguish him from Cleitus the White.  Military Service  Cleitus was made a commander of the Greek Cavalry under Philip II, a position he would retain under Alexander the Great. At the Battle of the Granicus in 334 BC, when Alexander was personally under attack by Rhoesaces and Spithridates, Cleitus severed Spithridates's hammer arm before the Persian satrap could bring it down on Alexander thus saving his life.Arrian, Anabasis Alexandri, i. 12, 15, 16Plutarch, The Life of Alexander, 16. He would later be promoted to one of the two commanders of the companion cavalry following the trial and execution of Philotas.  The death of Cleitus  The quarrel between Alexander and Cleitus In 328 BC Artabazos resigned his satrapy of Bactria, and Alexander gave it to Cleitus.Smith, William (editor); Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, \\"Cleitus (2)\\", Boston, (1867), p. 785. On the eve of the day on which he was to set out to take possessions of his government, Alexander organized a banquet during a feast day for Dionysus in the satrapial palace at Maracanda (what is now the town of Samarkand). At this banquet an angry dispute arose, the particulars of which are disputed by various authors. Most of the members were rather drunk, and Alexander announced a reorganization of commands. Specifically, Cleitus was given orders to take 16,000 of the defeated Greek mercenaries who formerly fought for the Persian King north to fight the steppe nomads in Central Asia. Cleitus knew that he would no longer be near the king and would be a forgotten man. Furious at the thought of commanding what he saw as second-rate soldiers and fighting nomads in the middle of nowhere, he spoke his mind. To make matters worse, when Alexander arrogantly boasted that his accomplishments were far greater than that of his father, Phillip II, Cleitus responded by saying that Alexander was not the legitimate king of the Macedonians, and that all of his achievements were due to his father. Alexander called for his guards, but they did not want to intervene in a quarrel between friends. Alexander kills Cleitus, painting by Andr√© Castaigne 1898‚Äì1899 Alexander threw an apple at Cleitus' head and called for a dagger or spear, but the party near the two men removed the dagger, restrained Alexander, and hustled Cleitus out of the room. The Hypaspists had conveniently left the vicinity of Alexander. Alexander then called for his trumpeter to summon the army; the alarm was not sounded. Nevertheless, Cleitus managed to return to the room to utter more grievances against Alexander (it is possible that Cleitus had not even left the room). But sources agree that at this point Alexander got hold of a javelin and threw it through Cleitus's heart. In all of the four major known texts, it is shown that Alexander grieved for the death of Cleitus. Alexander may have genuinely not wanted to kill Cleitus. However, Cleitus was a member of Philip II's generation and Alexander had been removing that generation from power to keep his own peers in power. The motives of Cleitus in this quarrel have been interpreted in various ways. Cleitus may have been angered at Alexander's increasing adoption of Persian customs. After the death of King Darius III, Alexander was legally King of the Persian Empire. Alexander was now employing eunuchs and was tolerant of such Persian customs as proskynesis, which was considered degrading by many in the Macedonian army. Cultural references Cleitus, as Clito, appears as a character in Handel's opera Alessandro. The American poet John Berryman recounts the tale of \\"Kleitos\\" in his thirty-third \\"dream song.\\" The death of Cleitus at Alexander's hand is depicted in a scene of the film Alexander. Cleitus' death is also described in Mary Butts' 1931 novel The Macedonian. Cleitus' story is recalled in Henry V in comparing Sir John Falstaff and King Henry V to Cleitus and Alexander in Act IV Scene 7 Lines 33-50 FTLN 2544-2561 Seneca the Younger makes a reference to Cleitus' death in letter 83 of his book Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium.

Founded in Hanau in 1851, the company is one of the largest family-owned companies in Germany in terms of revenue.http://www.griequity.com/resources/industryandissues/familybusiness/topglobal.html According to company statements, in 2017 Heraeus generated product revenues of ‚Ç¨2.2 billion and precious metals trading revenue of ‚Ç¨19.6 billion on the strength of approximately 13,001 employees in more than 100 companies.https://www.heraeus.com/en/group/about_heraeus/facts_and_figures/facts_and_figures.aspx  History  = 1851 ‚Äì 1895 = The Einhorn Apothecary in Hanau In 1851, at the age of 24, the pharmacist and chemist Wilhelm Carl Heraeus took over his father's \\"Einhorn Apothecary\\" in Hanau. The business had been in the ownership of the Heraeus family since 1660, acting as an official court apothecary to local counts. Wilhelm Carl Heraeus began laying the foundations for a global family business, which has now been headquartered in Hanau, east of Frankfurt, for more than 150 years. At the time, Hanau was a town of goldsmiths. Since the end of the 18th century, platinum had been processed in the town for the production of jewellery. Goldsmiths had extreme difficulty processing platinum due to its toughness and high melting point of 1770 degrees Celsius. Until a melting process was discovered, platinum could only be processed by using complex forging processes using the white-hot metal. Having studied chemistry and pharmacy, Wilhelm Carl Heraeus understood the problems faced by goldsmiths. After a series of experiments, he first succeeded in melting platinum in large volumes and producing pure metal in 1856, using his own specially developed oxyhydrogen blowpipe. It was already known at the time that platinum could be melted using oxyhydrogen, a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gas ‚Äì but until then, only small quantities had been melted in a laboratory. With his gas blowpipe, Heraeus could produce enough oxyhydrogen and a large enough flame front to melt several kilograms of platinum- containing materials. This pioneering achievement enabled Heraeus to found the \\"W.C. Heraeus First German Platinum Smelters\\", supplying a variety of customers such as goldsmith workshops and jewellery factories throughout the world, as well as dental manufacturers, chemistry laboratories and other branches of industry. In 1857, W.C. Heraeus succeeded in producing around 30 kilograms of pure platinum. By 1896, he was melting and processing more than 1000 kilograms of pure platinum.http://corporate.heraeus.com/en/berheraeus/unternehmensgeschichte/history_hh.html = 1896 ‚Äì 1927 = Crucibles made of platinum and quartz Further experimentation in the platinum smelters‚Äô laboratories resulted in a variety of inventions and revolutionary new production processes. These included the production of pharmaceutical iron compounds, chemically pure hydrofluoric acid, rubidium and caesium. Most production at this time still involved platinum, which was used in more and more applications due to its chemical and physical properties. As it is also highly resistant to acids and heat, platinum was also used to make instruments such as scientific tools, crucibles and vessels used in chemistry and physics. As early as the 19th century, platinum had already been used in locking pins to hold false teeth in place. Platinum was also used to make filaments in light bulbs and non-corrosive electrical contacts in telephones. As the company continued to expand, it needed new premises ‚Äì so in 1896, the W.C. Heraeus Platinum Smelting Factory was established just outside Hanau, employing 40 people. Two years later, Wilhelm and Heinrich Heraeus, the two sons of the company founder, took over as managers. They were responsible for pushing ahead with research and development, and bringing on board a former school friend, the physicist and chemist Richard K√ºch. K√ºch, who became a director in 1909, had many contacts in the world of science and continued to carry out fundamental research, resulting in further growth in the company. Among his achievements were the development of a process to melt rock crystal at around 2000 ¬∞C to produce quartz glass. The quartz glass produced by the company was almost entirely free of defects and was of outstanding purity. It is still used in medicine today and is a highly sought-after material in manufacturing on account of its translucence and resistance to heat and acids. With the advent of ceramic colours, more and more platinum was needed for production processes and Heraeus started supplying products to the electrochemical and plastics industries. By the beginning of the 20th century, a major platinum processing boom was underway, caused by demand in the chemicals industry for large volumes of platinum thermocouples and platinum-rhodium catalysts needed to produce nitric acid. One of the most significant technical innovations in metal processing is credited to Heraeus: the melting of metals under vacuum. Heraeus Vacuumschmelze and Doctor Wilhelm Rohn applied for a patent on this process on 12 January 1918 and were granted a German patent DE 345161.Patent DE 345161, Vacuumschmelze and Dr. Wilhelm Rohn, Verfahren zum Vakuumschmelzen und Vergueten von Metallen und Legierungen, priority date 12 January 1918, published 12 June 1921. Heraeus was subsequently granted British patent GB 138648, Swiss patent CH 89145, and several French patents on the process. For a short time, Heraeus set up an independent division dedicated to this technology, ‚ÄòHeraeus Vacuum Smelting‚Äô, which registered 84 German patents in 10 years. = 1927 ‚Äì 1945 = The third generation of the family took over the business in 1927, under Wilhelm Heinrich Heraeus and his cousin Reinhard Heraeus, who remained at the helm of the business for nearly 40 years. During this time, Heraeus tapped into a variety of new material discoveries. For example, they started producing the first dental alloys. This approach took the company from strength to strength and broadened its product portfolio. The company also suffered setbacks during this time. The First World War and hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic resulted in the collapse of the precious metal market in Russia and massive swings in the price of platinum. As a result, Heraeus began focussing its research activities on recycling techniques and started to look for suitable ersatz materials and substances to replace precious metals. Despite the turbulent times in Germany, the business continued to grow. By 1939 it employed around 1000 people, with annual sales of around 20 million Reichsmarks. With the outbreak of the Second World War, many workers were drafted into military service. The company shifted its production to electrical contacts with low densities of precious metals, catalysts, and rhodium reflectors for anti-aircraft searchlights. Allied bombing raids in 1944 and 1945 resulted in the near-total destruction of the town of Hanau as well as Heraeus production facilities. = 1945 ‚Äì 1983 = During German reconstruction, the company turned its attention back to its established products and expanding new production facilities. The first steps towards expanding internationally and entering foreign markets had already been laid at the beginning of the 20th century by the company's founder. The company re-established its network of contacts after the Second World War, allowing it to gain new customers in the American market for quartz glass for optical applications. Beginning in 1958, the company founded its first sales subsidiaries in France and Italy, followed by full subsidiaries and international holdings as of 1972. The company subsequently set up new quartz glass factories in Japan and the United States, followed by manufacturing facilities in South Korea and the Philippines to produce contact wires (wire bonding) made of pure gold for use in semiconductor components. In 1970, Helmut Gruber, a respected physicist in the field of metallurgy, took over as head director, with company-wide responsibility for the technical department. Gruber pushed ahead with operations in the fields of quartz glass, precious metal chemistry and special metals. He also set up even more subsidiaries outside Germany. Sales outside Germany first outstripped domestics sales in 1979. = Since 1983 = A troy ounce of gold with a Heraeus imprint From 1983 until 2000, the company ‚Äì by now in its fourth generation ‚Äì was headed up by J√ºrgen Heraeus, the son of Reinhard Heraeus and a company director since 1970. Under his management, the business grew into a global group of companies. To pave the way for this expansion, the company was fundamentally reorganised and modern management structures introduced. Following the founding of Heraeus Holding GmbH in 1985, the company underwent an intense period of decentralisation in 1990. Under the umbrella of the management holding, the group's core activities of precious metals, dental materials, quartz glass, sensors and medical technology were reorganised into five decentralised, independent management divisions. Simultaneously, the company expanded in Asia. Heraeus also entered strategically important markets, such as through the acquisition of Electro-Nite. As the company grew, sales and operating profits reflected its standing as an international group. By 2001, sales outside Germany first broke the 74% mark. To exploit synergies throughout the group, Heraeus refocused its activities on core business, resulting in the setting up of Heraeus Noblelight as an independent business in 2001. The Heraeus Med part of the company was sold in 2002, as were the group's shares in Kendro Laboratory Products. At the same time, W. C. Heraeus intensified its involvement in industrial precious metals by expanding its activities in the field of thin film materials. The company's wire bonding operations in China were also expanded, and the company entered into a joint venture in South Africa which soon evolved into a fully-fledged subsidiary. Heraeus also expanded its activities in medical technology with the acquisition of the Swiss company Metalor Medical Division. = Since 2001 ‚Äì More than 160 years of Heraeus = After Heraeus Dental was sold to the Mitsui Group, a Japanese company, in 2013, Heraeus Holding comprised six business groups. Under a restructuring of the organization, the business groups Heraeus Precious Metals and Heraeus Materials Technology were converted to seven new Global Business Units. The four remaining business groups were retained and are now likewise managed as Global Business Units (GBUs). As of January 2015, the Heraeus Group is organized under the umbrella of Heraeus Holding with eleven Global Business Units. In October 2018, Heraeus extended its sales channels in Germany by opening the online platform Heraeus-Gold.de in co-operation with the precious metals trader Ophirum GmbH. The platform allows retail customers to buy Heraeus precious metal bars and a variety of popular coins.  Corporate structure  = Heraeus Metal Management = This Global Business Unit includes products of the precious metals cycle, including precious metals trading, precious metals recycling, and the melting and pre-production of precious metals. These functions, which were formerly located in Heraeus Precious Metals and Heraeus Materials Technology, were combined to form the current Heraeus Metal Management. = Heraeus Chemicals = This Global Business Unit specializes in the development of products and solutions for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. In addition to catalysts, it also sells pharmaceutical ingredients. = Heraeus Electronics = This Global Business Unit manufactures products for the electronics, consumer goods and automotive industries. These include bonding wires and assembly materials for integrated circuit and mounting technologies, as well as miniaturized electronics components such as thick film pastes, powders and conductive polymers. = Heraeus Photovoltaics = This Global Business Unit is a manufacturer in the field of thick film technology for the photovoltaics industry. = Heraeus Medical Components = This Global Business Unit develops and produces components and solutions for the medical technology industry. These include microparts such as pacemaker components and components for the treatment of vascular diseases. = Heraeus Performance Products = Products manufactured by Heraeus Performance Products can be found in the hard drive industry, the watchmaking and automotive industries, and in the areas of lab equipment and decorative coloring. = Heraeus Medical = Heraeus Medical manufactures bone cements and develops coatings for medical implants. Its products are used in orthopedic surgery as well as traumatology and biosurgery. = Heraeus Electro-Nite = Heraeus Electro-Nite provides measurement and sampling technology for metal smelting. Its portfolio includes sensors, sampling devices tailored for specific applications, and hardware and software for systems technology. = Heraeus Quarzglas = Heraeus Quarzglas specializes in the manufacture and processing of high-purity quartz glass. This Global Business Unit manufactures quartz glass for the semiconductor and telecommunications industries as well as for applications in the optical, chemical and lamp industries. = Heraeus Noblelight = Specialty light sources from Heraeus Noblelight are used in the industrial, scientific and medical fields, with wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet to infrared. = Heraeus Emerging Businesses = This Global Business Unit includes the two business lines Sensors and Display & Semiconductors. = Incubator New Businesses = The Incubator New Businesses is a platform for new, high growth businesses. These activities are independently managed and include among others: * Heraeus Fuel Cells GmbH, producer of AnkaloN(R) Catalyst Coated Membranes (CCMs) for PEM fuel cells in automobiles, transport and commercial vehicles, as well as stationary applications. * Heraeus Additive Manufacturing GmbH (H3D), solution provider for Additive Manufacturing. H3D develops powders and manufacturing processes for advanced materials such as metallic glasses,https://3dprint.com/138610/3d-printing-amorphous-metals/ refractory metals, titanium aluminides and precious metals.  Sold, restructured and disinvested businesses  As part of the reorganization in 2015, Heraeus Precious Metals and Materials Technology were converted to seven Global Business Units. = W.C. Heraeus = The precious metals division of the company always generated the most sales for Heraeus. When the price of gold, silver and platinum rose sharply in the 1930s, Heraeus also turned to platinum group metals such as palladium, rhodium and ruthenium. The development of the precious metal strowger switch and high-speed contact opened the market to Heraeus in 1950 to sell large volumes of contact rivets and springs. This laid the foundations for the company to enter markets such as telecommunications, microelectronics and computing. W. C. Heraeus was split up in 2010 to form Heraeus Precious Metals and Heraeus Materials Technology.http://heraeus- contactmaterials.com/en/aboutus_1/aboutwch/history_packagecorporatecontent.aspx = Heraeus Kulzer = The particularly hard nature of the dental material Alba (an alloy of gold, silver and palladium) allowed Heraeus to supply dental technology as early as the 1930s. In the years that followed, Heraeus developed a variety of gold and ceramic bonding alloys. Heraeus Kulzer was split up in 2009 to form Heraeus Dental and Heraeus Medical.http://heraeus- dental-us.com/en/company/history/history_1.html = Heraeus Vacuum Smelting = The process of smelting metals in a vacuum is based on early development work carried out by Heraeus. The first vacuum furnaces came into use before the First World War. They were used to make alloys in the total absence of air. The first vacuum induction furnace was developed in 1917. Heraeus Vacuum Smelting started operations as an independent company in 1923, producing a variety of base metal alloys for use in electrics. The company owned 84 German patents between 1923 and 1933, resulting in 101 foreign registrations. Due to the increasingly high cost of investment and the different nature of this area of the business compared to the rest of the company, Heraeus sold its Vacuum Smelting business to Siemens (now SMS-MEVAC) in 1933. The Ruhrstahl-Heraeus process for vacuum degassing of steel was also a Heraeus innovation.http://www.heraeusvectra.com.br/ingles/historico/frame_historico.asp = Heraeus Analytical Technology = In the beginning of the 20th century Heraeus became a pioneer in the automatization of combustion analysis for the determination of non-metallic elements like carbon, nitrogen, sulphur, hydrogen and oxygen in chemicals, pharmaceuticals and environmental samples.Fritz Pregl mentioned this company several times in his book on micro- analysis of organic substances (Pregl, Fritz: Die quantitative organische Mikroanalyse. Berlin: Springer, 1917. . pp. 60, 109, 124) This development was made possible through the experience gained in the high temperature furnace technology needed for melting of platinum, which has a high melting point of 1770 degrees Celsius.http://corporate.heraeus.com/en/berheraeus/unternehmensgeschichte/history_hh.html Heraeus corporate history. Website of Heraeus Holding. Retrieved 2015-08-04. Building on the know-how in handling high temperatures for chemical processes, Richard K√ºch, a researcher at the Heraeus Platinum Smelting Factory, was able to produce quartz glass of very high purity,http://spie.org/x41658.xml Society of Photographic Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). Retrieved 2015-08-04. which is still the material of choice for combustion tubes used in modern combustion analyzers. Richard K√ºch's invention together with the experience in high temperature furnace technology resulted in the commercial production of automated and semi-automated elemental analyzers. Due to the too low profitability and different nature compared to the precious metal core business of Heraeus, the Analytical Technology Division was sold in 1995 to form Elementar.  Speciality products  = Quartz glass = Heraeus began to continuously expand its product portfolio starting at the turn of the 20th century, moving into areas such as the production of optical instruments, infrared emitters and laboratory equipment. It produced plates, prisms and corrective lenses for the optical industry (under the names Homosil and Ultrasil) plus opaque quartz glass under the name Rotosil. In the late 1960s, Heraeus also produced ultra-pure isotropic/homogeneous quartz glass for space exploration. This special optical quartz glass was used in retroreflectors set up on the moon during the Apollo landings. These were used to measure the exact distance between the earth and the moon and are still in use today. Heraeus also developed a new process for making high-quality synthetic quartz glass from silicon tetrachloride. In the late 1960s, this opened up a completely new market for the company: quartz fibre technology for the optical transmission of data in the telecommunications industry, followed by product developments in the field of optical fibres in 1972. In 1986, the first synthetic waveguide tubes were developed, and in 1992, production of synthetic quartz glass began in Bitterfeld. Heraeus has established itself as a supplier of devices and optical components for the semiconductor industry.http://heraeus-quarzglas.com/en/quarzglas/quarzglas_1/Quarzglas.aspx = Speciality lighting = In 1904, Richard K√ºch discovered that evaporated quicksilver (mercury) in a quartz tube acted as an intense light source when stimulated with electricity. In light of this discovery, Heraeus joined forces with AEG and founded a quartz lamp company, culminating in the development of the ‚ÄòOriginal Hanau Synthetic Sunlamp‚Äô which flooded onto the German market as early as the 1930s. By the 1950s, the tanning lamp had become a popular consumer electronics item. After buying out AEG in 1973, a number of newly developed products were added to the range. Heraeus Noblelight now supplies infrared and ultraviolet emitters as well as UV-LEDs to a variety of industries, for use in automotive production, printing, plastics and semiconductors, analytical instruments, laser and environmental technology in solariums, and water and air treatment.http://heraeus- noblelight.com/en/divisions/hng_divisions_overview.aspxhttp://heraeus- noblelight.com/en/applications/hng_applications_overview.aspxhttp://heraeus- noblelight.com/en/products_1/hng_products_overview.aspx = Sensors = Heraeus first started producing thermocouples and thermometers with platinum and platinum alloy wires under the directorship of Richard K√ºch. The technology still forms the basis of Heraeus temperature measurement technology today. By the mid-1960s, analysis technology was added to the product portfolio. After the takeover of the Belgian Electro-Nite Group in 1987, immersion thermocouples and gas probes were added to Heraeus's array of measurement technology for use in the steel and aluminium industry. In 1997, the company founded Heraeus Sensor-Nite, specialised in temperature sensors needed in platinum thin-film technology for use in automotive construction, electronics and household appliances.http://heraeus-sensor- technology.de/en/home/home.aspxhttp://heraeus-sensor- technology.de/en/produkte_1/produkte_start.aspx  Customers  Heraeus supplies products to manufacturing companies in the automotive sector, the aerospace sector, telecommunications, the chemical industry, medical technology and the steel industry.http://corporate.heraeus.com/en/berheraeus/konzernstruktur/business_groups.html References External links * Official Company Website * Heraeus Kulzer South America Category:Medical technology companies of Germany Category:Companies based in Hesse Category:German companies established in 1851 Category:Bullion dealers Category:Manufacturing companies of Germany Category:German brands ","title":"Heraeus"},{"id":"2511164","text":"Banducci outside the club in 1969 The hungry i was a nightclub in San Francisco, originally located in the North Beach neighborhood. It played a major role in the history of stand-up comedy in the US. It was launched by Eric \\"Big Daddy\\" Nord, who sold it to Enrico Banducci in 1951. The club moved to Ghirardelli Square in 1967 and operated mostly as a rock music venue until it closed in 1970. Name How the club's name came about is something of a mystery. According to one story, the lower-case \\"i\\" was meant to represent \\"intellectual\\". Banducci swore that it was Freudian and was short for \\"the hungry id\\". In another story, the sign was not finished in time for the club's opening, and next-day reviews in the San Francisco papers cemented the name for all time. \\"I was going to call it the Hungry Intellectual, but I ran out of paint\\" for the sign, Nord would tell interviewers. In another story, artist Mark Adams came up with the name. \\"It (the lowercase 'i') designated the first-person singular, with all of its various cravings,\\" he explained in a 1985 interview quoted in a 2007 obituary for him.Nolte, Carl (October 9, 2007) \\"Enrico Banducci: 1922-2007 The impresario of North Beach\\" (obituary) San Francisco Chronicle Retrieved October 20, 2011 Eric Nord (right, 1959 in Los Angeles) Club The hungry i was founded in 1949 or 1950 as an 83-seat venue in the Sentinel Building's basement at the corner of Kearny and Columbus, by Eric Nord, who sold it to Banducci in 1951. After operating it as a venue for folk singers including Stan Wilson, Banducci began hiring comedians in 1953 with Mort Sahl, encouraging them to express themselves freely. Their success caused queues around the block, until Banducci moved the hungry i to the nearby International Hotel (nicknamed \\"the I-Hotel\\") on Jackson Street in 1954. The hungry i and Banducci were instrumental in the careers of actor/comic Ronnie Schell, comic Bill Cosby, comic Lenny Bruce, and minister Malcolm Boyd. Musically, The Kingston Trio recorded two noted albums at the hungry i,‚Ä¶from the \\"Hungry i\\" including the first live performance of their version of \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\". Tom Lehrer's final satirical album That Was the Year That Was (1965) was also recorded there, as well as The Limeliters' album Our Men in San Francisco (1963). Jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi, folk singer Glenn Yarborough, the Gateway Singers, and comedians Godfrey Cambridge, Professor Irwin Corey, Joan Rivers and Mort Sahl were also given career boosts from their appearances at the hungry i, as well as Dick Cavett and Woody Allen. The folk-rock group We Five were signed to A&M; records after Herb Alpert saw them perform there. John Phillips and his group The Journeymen were the house band in the early '60s. Phillips would later achieve fame with The Mamas & the Papas. The young Barbra Streisand begged Banducci for a single night at his nightclub, insisting that she would soon be a huge star. Banducci agreed to sign the singer, who had never performed professionally but was soon starring in I Can Get It for You Wholesale on Broadway. The resulting concerts (March‚ÄìApril 1963) were well-attended, giving Streisand nationwide acclaim.'hungry i' at Barbra Archives website On 16 January 1967, Laura Nyro started her debut live performances at the hungry i. Later in the same year, Ike & Tina Turner performed at the club and a photograph of Tina Turner by Baron Wolman was used for the cover of the second issue of Rolling Stone magazine. The comedy and folk music scene wilted in the mid-1960s. On 12 October 1967 Banducci closed the club at its International Hotel location and moved to Ghirardelli Square; it was mainly a rock music venue, and closed in 1970. Banducci and many of the club's performers, including Mort Sahl, Jonathan Winters, Professor Irwin Corey, Jackie Vernon, and many others, reunited in 1981 for a one-night performance, which also featured film of the late Lenny Bruce.

History Since the fifteenth century, and possibly even earlier, the \\"Holy House\\" of Loreto has been numbered among the most famous shrines of Italy. Loreto is a small town a few miles south of Ancona and near the sea. Its most conspicuous building is the basilica. This dome-crowned edifice, which with its various annexes took more than a century to build and adorn under the direction of many famous artists, serves merely as the setting of a tiny cottage standing within the basilica itself. Though the rough walls of the little building have been raised in height and are cased externally in richly sculptured marble, the interior measures only 31 feet by 13. An altar stands at one end beneath a statue, blackened with age, of the Virgin Mother and her Divine Infant. As the inscription, Hic Verbum caro factum est, reminds us, this building is honoured by Christians as the veritable cottage at Nazareth in which the Holy Family lived, and the Word became incarnate.CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Santa Casa di Loreto (Holy House of Loreto) Ordinaries *Gaetano Malchiodi ‚Ä† (25 Jan 1935 ‚Äì 26 Jan 1960 Retired) *Angelo Prinetto ‚Ä† (18 Oct 1961 ‚Äì 25 Apr 1965 Resigned) *Aurelio Sabattani ‚Ä† (24 Jun 1965 ‚Äì 30 Sep 1971 Appointed, Secretary of the Apostolic Signatura) *Loris Francesco Capovilla ‚Ä† (25 Sep 1971 ‚Äì 10 Dec 1988 Resigned) *Pasquale Macchi ‚Ä† (10 Dec 1988 ‚Äì 7 Oct 1996 Retired) *Angelo Comastri (9 Nov 1996 ‚Äì 5 Feb 2005 Appointed, Coadjutor Archpriest of Saint Peter's Basilica) *Gianni Danzi ‚Ä† (22 Feb 2005 ‚Äì 2 Oct 2007 Died) *Giovanni Tonucci (18 Oct 2007 ‚Äì 20 May 2017 retired) *Fabio Dal Cin (20 May 2017 ‚Äì Present) See also *Territorial prelature *Prelate References Category:Roman Catholic dioceses in Italy Category:Christian organizations established in 1965 Category:1965 establishments in Italy Loreto Category:Territorial prelatures Category:Loreto, Marche ","title":"Roman Catholic Territorial Prelature of Loreto"},{"id":"2511170","text":"General The Honourable Sir George Cathcart (12 May 1794 ‚Äì 5 November 1854) was a British general and diplomat. Military career He was born in Renfrewshire, son of William Cathcart, 1st Earl Cathcart. After receiving his education at Eton and in Edinburgh, he was commissioned into the Life Guards in 1810. In 1813 he went to Russia to serve as aide-de-camp to his father, who was ambassador and military commissioner. George Cathcart was present at the battles between the Russian and the French army in 1813 and he followed the Russian army through Europe, entering Paris in March 1814. General Cathcart death at Inkerman When Napoleon returned in 1815, Cathcart served as aide-de- camp to the Duke of Wellington and was present at the battles of Quatre Bras and Waterloo. After the war he was commissioned in the 7th Hussars, promoted to lieutenant-colonel in 1826. He then joined the 57th Regiment in 1828, the 8th Hussars in 1830 and the 1st Dragoon Guards in 1838. Cathcart was promoted to colonel in 1841. In 1852 to 1853, as Governor of the Cape of Good Hope, he granted the first constitution to the colony, ended the 8th Cape Frontier War and crushed the Basutos. In 1853 he was appointed Adjutant-General to the Forces. At the start of the Crimean war, he was appointed to command the 4th infantry division. The British government gave him a \\"dormant commission\\" which meant that if something were to happen to Lord Raglan, Cathcart would take command. At the Battle of the Alma in September 1854, his division saw no action and after the Battle of Balaclava, where his division was called into action, his dormant commission was revoked. He advised a infantry assault on Sevastopol, thinking it could be taken, but was turned down by Lord Raglan. He took command of the 1st Brigade during the Battle of Inkerman, where there was great confusion, was told to \\"Support the Guards\\", and then led his men too far, and was shot through the heart while charging up a hill with a company of 50 men from the 20th Regiment of Foot on 5 November 1854.

At the age of 18, he graduated with high distinction the School of Music in Chisinau in the class of piano of the prominent teacher and pianist Juliy (Idely) Guz. By that time he met the Romanian virtuoso Grigora»ô Dinicu who invited him in his ensemble as a concert pianist, accompagnateur and arranger. In 1920 he entered the class of piano at the National University of Music Bucharest.

While studying there, he began to concentrate on the development of the written Lithuanian language, and wrote a commentary on Lithuanian and Samogitian dialects Apie lietuvi≈≥ ir ≈æemaiƒçi≈≥ kalbƒÖ. It was the first scholarly attempt to distinguish these different Lithuanian dialects. While in the seminary, Baranauskas started writing poems in Lithuanian, and from that time essentially wrote in that language. One of his earlier works written under the influence of Mickiewicz was Anyk≈°ƒçi≈≥ ≈°ilelis (The Forest/Pinewood of Anyk≈°ƒçiai). It is considered a classic work of Lithuanian literature. Literature critics consider it as a symbolic reference to Lithuanian history and language. While some critics contend that Baranauskas wrote the poem in anger, in response to an assertion by his lector Alexander Gabszewicz that the Lithuanian language was not beautiful enough to write poems in, others dispute this as a misinterpretation. The poem was first published in 1861, and again in 1862 in Laurynas Ivinskis' calendars. From 1858 to 1862, Barnauskas studied at the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy, receiving a master's degree in theology. Between 1863 and 1864, he studied at Munich's, Rome's, Innsbruck's and Louvain's Catholic universities. Starting in 1871, he worked at the Kaunas Priest Seminary, and began teaching the Lithuanian language. He authored a grammar textbook in Lithuanian, Mokslas lietuvi≈°kosios kalbos. After Baranauskas went to Sejny, he gained a considerable reputation by being able to preach in both Polish and Lithuanian. By 1880, after he realized that the ban of printing in the Lithuanian language would not be lifted, in spite of several unofficial promises by Tsarist authorities to do so, his desire to promote the Lithuanian language slowly declined. He never ceased to believe, that Lithuanian should be developed and expanded and until his death worked on a translation of the Bible into Lithuanian, and working 10‚Äì12 hours a day, succeeded to translate three fifths of the Old Testament. In his later years, Antanas Baranauskas, enjoyed some of the comforts of life. His beliefs were similar to the later Krajowcy group. Therefore, for the rest of his life he tried to reconcile nationalists from both - Lithuanian and Polish - sides. For that he was rather unpopular amongst the nationalists in both sides. Most of the Lithuanians did not attend his burial, considering him a traitor of the national revival movement, mostly Russian officials and Poles attended it. It was a completely different story when a monument for him was built in Sejny. Only Lithuanians attended the event, and even then paint was spilt on the monument the following night.  Legacy  Before Baranauskas, the main \\"respectable\\" languages in the area were considered to be Russian and Polish, so Baranauskas was one of the few primary individuals responsible for re-legitimizing the Lithuanian language, and by extension, Lithuanian culture. Referring to Baranauskas in a lecture, the early 20th century Lithuanian poet Maironis once said, \\"Without him, there might not be us\\". Baranauskas's home is preserved in the Anyk≈°ƒçiai Regional Park.

At the time of the address, sickness was spreading through Philadelphia and Adams notes in his introduction that he was tempted to relocate the assembly of the national legislature but avoided this due to inevitable expense and general inconvenience. French aggression Adams began his State of the Union Address by expressing concern over European, most notably French, aggression towards American merchant vessels. He emphasizes the importance of America's growing role in international commerce, citing accomplishments in agriculture and commercial fishing. In July and August 1797 delegates traveled to the Batavian Republic and then to France. They arrived in Paris on September 19 and began negotiations in the hope of pacifying Franco-American relations. At the time the speech was delivered, the status of the meetings in France were unknown, but Adams knew and stated in the speech that war, with France or possibly other European countries, for example Great Britain, was becoming an increasingly likely turn of events. The Federalist Party advocated going to war, but Adams ignored Francophobia and avoided going to war with France until 1798 in the Quasi-War. The U.S. later went to war with Britain in the War of 1812, partly due to Jefferson's refusal to pay tribute to a foreign nation. John Adams was a communist.'''''' Colonial competition and intimidation of the U.S. Piracy of American ships in international waters by the French was a microcosm of French and British colonial competition; specifically, French aggression was a reaction to the Jay Treaty, which they perceived was an Anglo-American alliance, and the belief that tribute could be collected from the infantile republic by exerting sufficient military pressure. Adams' assertion that \\"respect to treaties has been so diminished\\" is a reference to the violation of the Treaty of Alliance by the French through piracy and the violation of Pinckney's Treaty by the Spanish through illegal garrisons in the western U.S. frontiers. The Jay Treaty, Pinckney's Treaty, the Treaty of Tripoli, also negotiated by Thomas Pinckney, the Treaty with Tunis, and France's attempt at forming a similar treaty with the U.S. in March 1797, the infamous XYZ Affair, were attempts by foreign powers to extort money and power from the U.S. government while limiting the influence other world powers had on the emerging nation. Although these treaties were highly unfavorable to the U.S., the policy of appeasement carried out during the Washington and Adams administrations was necessary to provide time for the U.S. to build up its navy and militia. Foreign intervention in domestic affairs of the U.S. was not limited to abuses in the water. Adams condemned ventures by foreign agents, such as those of Spain, who tried to incite an insurgency among Native Americans. Adams expresses hope that the as yet unfulfilled obligations of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce (1797), surveying the St. Croix River between Maine and New Brunswick and paying debts American citizens owed to British subjects prior to the American Revolutionary War, due to various unstated causes, and the unfulfilled obligations of the Spanish regarding compensation for American ships stolen or destroyed in recent Franco-Spanish hostilities, will continue without offending citizens of any country. He deplores the impressing of American soldiers by French and Spanish forces and criticizes the legal framework concerning the proper reaction to such action; how to guarantee the safe return of captured seamen from foreign territories, and the inability of consuls to \\"demand an inspection of the registers and sea letters.\\" National debt Adams directly addresses the House of Representatives in regard to the national debt and taxes which had to be raised in order to fund a larger, more mobile Army. He warns against loans as he believed that they had contributed to the vast debt and economic collapse of historical empires. He ends his address by reiterating his general theme of the necessity to militarize to adequately defend against foreign imperialism.

He served in the court of Henry VIII and fought in the Scottish campaign where he was knighted for his valour. In 1553 he was selected by a company of London merchants to lead a fleet of three vessels in search of a northeast route to the Far East. Willoughby and the crews of two ships died on the voyage while the third vessel went on to open a successful and long-lasting trading arrangement with Russia. Biography Willoughby was the third and youngest son of Sir Henry Willoughby of Middleton, Derbyshire, a wealthy and influential gentleman who served in the courts of Richard III and Henry VII and was knighted by Henry VII following the Battle of Stoke Field in 1487.Payling, 2004 Hugh Willoughby served various roles in the court of Henry VIIIEvans 2014 and then joined the military to serve as a captain in the Scottish campaign of 1544. He was knighted at Leith by Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, then Earl of Hertford. In 1548 he became commander of Thirlestane Castle and served there until 1550, successfully withstanding a siege by the Scots and the French.Mayers, 2005 In 1551 he was again campaigning in the border country and eastern marches. The downfall and execution of Somerset in 1552 affected Willoughby's standing and caused him to look for other opportunities.Laughton, 1900McDermott, 2004 In 1553 a company of London merchants and courtiers were financing a voyage of exploration and trade. Organized by Sebastian Cabot, they hoped to find a northeast sea route to the Far East. Initially called the Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands, the trade organization became better known as the Muscovy Company. Willoughby petitioned to lead this expedition and although he lacked significant maritime experience, he was selected based on his distinguished family and his \\"singular skill in the services of war.\\" Three new vessels were constructed specifically for the voyage; on one ship the keel was lined with lead in hopes of preventing attack by shipworms. The fleet was well- provisioned for a lengthy voyage and an experienced crew was selected. On 10 May 1553, Willoughby set sail on the Bona Esperanza as captain-general of the fleet with two other vessels, the Edward Bonaventura and the Bona Confidentia, under his command. His chief pilot, Richard Chancellor, sailed on the Edward, captained by Stephen Borough. They left London with great fanfare and travelled slowly down the Thames, pausing at Greenwich to fire an artillery salute for the young King Edward. They were seriously delayed by unfavourable winds, only reaching the coast of Norway on 14 July, more than two months after leaving London. The ships were careful to stay together and agreed that if they were separated, they would rendezvous at Wardhouse, a small fortified outpost on Norwegian island of Vard√∏. On 30 July, they were beset by storms and \\"terrible whirlwinds\\" probably in the vicinity of the North Cape. Willoughby and one other ship, the Bona Confidentia, became separated from Chancellor on the Edward. The Edward sailed to Wardhouse as agreed and waited for seven days but the other two ships never appeared. Setting out again to resume their eastward journey, Chancellor found the entrance to the White Sea and moored at the mouth of the Dvina River near the convent of St. Nicholas. From there he was summoned to Moscow and Ivan the Terrible's Court, where he negotiated an agreement opening trade with Russia through the northern ports that lasted three hundred years. Willoughby and his crew were never seen alive again but the events following their separation can be pieced together from Willoughby's journal which was later recovered. The storm had blown them far from the coast and without any landmarks they became disoriented. Willoughby attempted to reach Wardhouse but their maps were misleading, compass readings were unreliable, and the weather was too overcast to measure latitude. For two weeks the ships sailed eastward until they encountered an uninhabited shoreline that was teeming with ducks and other birds. It was likely a part of the south island of Novaya Zemlya which came to be known to the Russians as Gusinaya Zemlya (Goose Land). They turned back and headed west, coasting along Kolguev Island and just missing the entrance to the White Sea where Chancellor had already landed. As the weather became colder and sea ice began to form they decided to winter in a bay formed by the Varzina River on the coast of the Kola Peninsula. Searches were made in three directions but no settlements were discovered. No one survived the winter; the two ships with the bodies of the crews, including Willoughby and his journal, were found by Russian fishermen the following spring. For many years it was assumed that they died from some combination of starvation and bitter cold. More recently it has been suggested that the crew may have been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning, resulting from a decision to insulate their ship and block their stove chimney to fight the Arctic cold.Gordon, 1986 The discovery was quickly reported back to the tsar in Moscow who ordered the ships secured and transferred to the White Sea to await recovery by the English. It was not until 1556 that crews were sent to Russia to sail the ships back to London. It was claimed that Willoughby's body was put on board for transport home. After leaving St. Nicholas on 20 July 1556, the two ships made it as far as the west coast of Norway when they encountered a storm that sank them both. Willoughby's journal did make it back to England safely on another ship. During the voyage, Willoughby thought he saw islands to the north. Based on his description, these were subsequently depicted on maps as Willoughby's Land and Macsinof or Matsyn Island.Hacquebord, 1995 See also * List of solved missing persons cases * Nesbit Willoughby * Risley Hall Notes References   * * External links *The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques,and Discoveries of The English Nation, v3: North-Eastern Europe and Adjacent Countries: Part II.

Plot A poet named Dan (Heath Ledger) falls in love with an art student named Candy (Abbie Cornish) who gravitates to his bohemian lifestyle ‚Äì and his love of heroin. Hooked as much on one another as they are on the drug, their relationship is alternating states of oblivion, self-destruction, and despair. The film is organized in 3 acts of roughly 3 scenes each, titled Heaven, Earth, and Hell: In Heaven, the young lovers ecstatically experience sex and drugs. Constantly seeking drug money, they borrow from Candy's parents or eccentric university professor Casper (Geoffrey Rush), selling things, stealing, even prostituting when desperate. In Earth they are married and confront the realities of addiction and family life. Dan purchases the drugs; Candy becomes a prostitute. Dan steals a credit card and gets the owner's PIN, then steals money from his bank funds. Candy becomes pregnant, and despite their efforts to \\"go clean\\", the baby is delivered stillborn at 23 weeks. They finally stop taking drugs with huge effort, going through agonizing withdrawal symptoms in the process. Despite poor living conditions, constant struggles for money, and frequent disputes, they love each other very much. In Hell they experience the dissolution of their relationship and recovery. They choose to move to the country to \\"try methadone\\" as a way to ease into a more normal life. After a disastrous Sunday lunch, Candy fights with her parents, breaks down, and screams at them to leave. Eventually, she becomes involved with a neighbor, a fellow drug user, and relapses to her previous lifestyle. She has a complete mental breakdown and becomes extremely distant toward Dan. He looks up Casper again, returning to his prodigal father, and instantly relapsing with his patented \\"yellow jesus.\\" Dan is informed the next morning of Candy's hospitalization back in Sydney, upon where he finds her in an unresponsive, semi-catatonic state. Dan returns to find Casper has died of a drug overdose; this forces Dan to reconsider his life. While Candy recovers in a clinic, Dan gets clean and gets a dishwashing job. When Candy returns to Dan, he says \\"There's no going back. If you're given a reprieve, I think it's good to remember just how thin it is\\" and she stands up and leaves.

There are also definitors in religious orders who generally provide counsel and assistance to the superiors general and provincial superiors of their order. Secular definitors In a deanery or vicarate forane, which is a grouping of several neighboring parishes within a diocese, a definitor is either the second (and unique) highest office, immediately below the dean or vicar forane and his deputy, or is the priest in charge of any of a number of even smaller districts within the deanery, called definitio. They oversee the ecclesiastical property and generally assist the dean, under the ordinary authority of the bishop. Alternative titles for this position are chamberlain or treasurer. These diocesan offices are not prescribed by canon law, and can be omitted. Regular definitors In the Cistercian Order, the Abbot General is assisted by a council of five definitors, traditionally two French- speaking, one German-speaking, one English-speaking and one Dutch-speaking. Among the Franciscan Observants, the Definitor is the third highest office of the Order, below the Minister General and Procurator General. In the Camaldolese Order, Definitor may be given as the personal title of a prior. In the Dominican Order a Provincial Definitor serves under the Prior Provincial.

Hodgson composed and sang the majority of the band‚Äôs hits such as \\"Dreamer\\", \\"Give a Little Bit\\", \\"Take the Long Way Home\\", \\"The Logical Song\\", \\"It's Raining Again\\", and \\"Breakfast in America\\". Hodgson left Supertramp in 1983 and moved his family away from the Los Angeles music scene to live a simpler lifestyle close to nature and be home with his children as they were growing up. Hodgson returned to touring in 2001. He often writes about spiritual and philosophical topics, and his lyrics have been described as personal and meaningful. Biography =1950‚Äì1969: Early years= Hodgson was born in Portsmouth, Hampshire, England, on 21 March 1950, the son of Charles and Jill Hodgson (n√©e Pomfret), and grew up in Oxford. He attended boarding schools Woodcote House near Windlesham, Surrey, where he was the first boy to learn electric guitar, and Stowe School near Buckingham, Buckinghamshire. Hodgson's first guitar, given to him when he was 12, was a parting gift from his father when his parents divorced. He took it to boarding school with him, where his teacher taught him three chords. He began composing his own music and lyrics and within a year gave his first concert at school with nine original songs at the age of 13. Hodgson's first band at school consisted of him on guitar and his friend Roy Hovey playing snare drums. They were dubbed the \\"H-bombs\\" because of their last names. When aged 19, Hodgson made his first appearance in a recording studio as guitarist for People Like Us, a band he joined shortly after leaving boarding school. The group recorded a single, \\"Duck Pond\\" and \\"Send Me No Flowers\\"(B-side), which was never released. See entry on \\"People Like Us\\" After People Like Us disbanded, Hodgson auditioned for Island Records, with Traffic's road manager providing him a foot in the door with the label. Island set him up in a recording studio as vocalist for the one-off \\"flower power\\" pop band Argosy, which also included Reginald Dwight (later known as Elton John), Caleb Quaye, and Nigel Olsson. See entry on \\"Argosy\\". Their sole single, \\"Mr. Boyd\\" and B-side \\"Imagine\\", consisted of two pieces of orchestrated pop (both penned by Hodgson) and was issued in 1969 on the DJM (UK) and Congress (US) record labels. \\"Mr. Boyd\\" was covered in 1997 by Jake Shillingford and his band My Life Story on their album \\"The Golden Mile\\". =1969‚Äì1983: Supertramp= Roger Hodgson in 2017 After the break-up of Argosy, Hodgson, responding to an advert placed in Melody Maker by Rick Davies, auditioned for the guitarist spot in the progressive rock band Supertramp. Similar to fellow British prog rockers Genesis' search for a new lead vocalist, 93 guitarists auditioned before Hodgson was chosen for the role, but when Richard Palmer arrived the next day to audition for the same spot, Hodgson agreed to learn bass instead. All the songs on Supertramp's self-titled first album, released in 1970, were composed by Hodgson, Davies, and Palmer. Hodgson and Davies collaborated on the composing while Palmer wrote the lyrics. Palmer left shortly after the album's recording, allowing Hodgson to switch back to guitar (as well as providing keyboards with Davies). From their second album Indelibly Stamped forward, Hodgson and Davies wrote separately with each singing lead vocals on their own compositions. Crime of the Century, released in 1974, was the first of their albums to feature the line-up of Hodgson, Davies and new members Bob Siebenberg (drums), Dougie Thomson (bass) and John Helliwell (saxophone, clarinet, keyboards, backing vocals). This line-up would remain unchanged for the remainder of Hodgson's tenure in the group. Hodgson's song \\"Dreamer\\" became the band's first hit and drove the album to the tops of the charts. It was one of the first keyboard songs Hodgson wrote on his new Wurlitzer piano that he bought when he was 19 years old. \\"Dreamer\\" was written after setting the keyboard up at his mother's house, at the first opportunity he had to play it. At the time, Hodgson had a two-track tape recorder and made a \\"very magical\\" demo of the song on the spot with multiple vocal harmonies, using tin cans, lampshades and cardboard boxes for percussion. Hodgson has expressed that he loves playing the song in concert because it \\"just brings out the dreamer in everyone. So often we let go of that side of ourselves and it kind of reminds the audience and reminds me when I'm singing it, too, to keep that place in us alive.\\" The follow-up Crisis? What Crisis?, their first album to be recorded in the US, was released in 1975. The album charted on both the UK Top TwentySupertramp in the UK Charts , The Official Charts. Retrieved 6 August 2011. and the US Top Fifty. By their 1977 release Even in the Quietest Moments, the band had permanently relocated to the United States. Hodgson's opening song on the album, \\"Give a Little Bit\\", became an international hit single (number 15 US, number 29 UK, number8 in Canada) and was written at 19 or 20 years of age; he introduced it to the band for recording five to six years later. Hodgson has stated the song was inspired by the Beatles' \\"All You Need Is Love\\", released during the love and peace movement of the 1960s. Diana, Princess of Wales loved the song, and Hodgson performed it in her honour at the 2007 Concert for Diana at Wembley Stadium. Hodgson said of the performance: \\"It was very wonderful when the audience all stood up, and the princes also, to sing 'Give a Little Bit' with me. That was a magical moment.\\" Hodgson has said it is a wonderful feeling as an artist to close his concerts with the song: \\"I look out and people just start hugging each other and they start singing with me. It's a very unifying song with a beautiful, simple message that I'm very proud of and really enjoy playing today.\\" Supertramp released their most successful album, Breakfast in America, in 1979; it has sold over 20 million copies to date. From that same album, \\"The Logical Song\\", written by Hodgson, is Supertramp's biggest chart hit in both the US and UK. In 1980, Hodgson was honoured with the Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters for \\"The Logical Song\\" being named the best song both musically and lyrically. To this day, \\"The Logical Song\\" also has the distinction of being one of the most quoted lyrics in schools. Hodgson composed the song from an autobiographical point of view, inspired by his experience of being sent away to boarding school for ten years. In recent interviews, Hodgson has said of the song's meaning that it was \\"born from my questions about what really matters in life. Throughout childhood we are taught all these ways to be and yet we are rarely told anything about our true self. We are taught how to function outwardly, but not guided to who we are inwardly. We go from the innocence and wonder of childhood to the confusion of adolescence that often ends in the cynicism and disillusionment of adulthood. In 'The Logical Song', the burning question that came down to its rawest place was 'please tell me who I am,' and that's basically what the song is about. I think this eternal question continues to hit such a deep chord in people around the world and why it stays so meaningful.\\" \\"Breakfast in America\\" was written by a young Roger before joining Supertramp. An error on a demo copy credits Rick Davies as the writer, but an addendum corrects it prior to the album's release. Hodgson has said that he wrote it during his late teens at a time when he \\"had a lot of dreams\\" and that it \\"still brings a smile to his face\\" when he sings it on stage. Prior to writing the song, he was driven to find a harmonium (also known as a pump organ); he found one at an elderly woman's house in a village in the English countryside, which he bought for 24 pounds. Hodgson brought it home and proceeded to write many songs on it immediately, \\"Breakfast in America\\" being one of them - because the harmonium \\"had a magical quality to it and still does\\". He had the lyrics written in about an hour in a \\"stream-of-consciousness\\" fashion, expressed from a \\"real joyful, playful place he was in at the time\\", while \\"dreaming of having kippers for breakfast to flying to America and seeing the girls in California, among other things\\". Hodgson still has the instrument today. The sound on the record is the original harmonium and a grand piano. The live album Paris was released in 1980. ...Famous Last Words..., released in 1982, included Hodgson's compositions \\"It's Raining Again\\", \\"Don't Leave Me Now\\", \\"C'est le Bon\\", \\"Know Who You Are\\" and \\"Crazy\\". Hodgson wrote hits such as \\"Give a Little Bit\\",(2009). 30th Anniversary Supertramp Feature, In the Studio. \\"It's Raining Again\\", \\"Take the Long Way Home\\", \\"Dreamer\\", and \\"Fool's Overture\\". In 1981, Hodgson moved his family from Los Angeles to northern California, where he built a home studio and began contemplating solo recordings. The rest of Supertramp remained in Los Angeles and the geographic separation created a rift between them and Hodgson; feuding was virtually non-existent, but the group harmony was lost. Hodgson felt increasingly constrained in the group context, and during the tour for ...Famous Last Words... he made the decision to leave Supertramp. He has stated that there were not any real problems in his relationship with Davies, as was speculated.(8 March 2009). \\"30 Years on From Breakfast in America\\", Swindonweb. =1984‚Äìpresent: Solo career= Roger Hodgson recorded three solo albums at his new home studio, the first before his departure from Supertramp. Titled Sleeping With the Enemy, it was cut in the months between the release of ...Famous Last Words... and its supporting tour, and mixed during Supertramp rehearsals for the tour in hopes of fitting in some solo promotion while on the road. However, at the last minute Hodgson had second thoughts about the album's quality and decided to scrap it, planning to record a new and better album after his last tour with Supertramp. In the Eye of the Storm, released in late September 1984, would prove to be Hodgson's biggest success without the group. The album became an international hit, selling over two million copies. The single \\"Had a Dream (Sleeping With the Enemy)\\" peaked at number 48 on Billboard's Hot 100 charts and number 11 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and the follow-up single \\"In Jeopardy\\" peaked at number 30. Hodgson's second album was Hai Hai (1987). However, just prior to the album's release, Hodgson fell from a loft in his home and broke both wrists, which disabled him from promoting the album. Doctors told him he would never play music again. Within a year and a half, he was playing again. He decided to take a long break from both touring and recording in order to spend more time with his children. In 1990, Hodgson was approached by Yes to join them as lead vocalist, but he declined the offer. One of the songs he co-wrote with Trevor Rabin, \\"Walls\\", appears on Yes's 1994 Talk album, with lyrics revised by Jon Anderson. A version of \\"Walls\\" with only Hodgson and Rabin on vocals was released on Rabin's 2003 archival release 90124. After a long break, Hodgson launched into his first tour in over ten years, and released 1997's Rites of Passage to document the tour. The live album was recorded at the Miners Foundry in Nevada City, California. He performed with a full band that included his son Andrew and Supertramp sax player John Helliwell. The album did not chart in the UK or the US, though it did reach number 34 in Germany. Hodgson played King Arthur in the rock opera Excalibur: La Legende Des Celtes, and appeared on the album for two songs: \\"The Elements\\", and \\"The Will of God\\". The project was headed by Alan Simon and released in 1999. In 2000, Hodgson contributed vocals on a track titled \\"The Moon Says Hello\\" by Carlos N√∫√±ez, on the CD Mayo Longo. Hodgson's fourth solo effort, Open the Door, was released in 2000 and continued in the vein of his previous work. He collaborated again with Alan Simon on the album. AllMusic stated of the album: \\"Fans will be delighted to hear Hodgson returning to the craft of writing high-quality songs\\"... \\"Open the Door is the closest thing to Supertramp since ...Famous Last Words....\\" In August 2000, Hodgson guested with Fairport Convention at that year's Cropredy Festival. He performed \\"Breakfast in America\\", \\"The Logical Song\\", \\"Open the Door\\" and \\"Give A Little Bit\\". Roger Hodgson performing on his Breakfast in America World Tour. In 2001, Hodgson toured as a member of Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band playing guitar and singing, and has since collaborated with Trevor Rabin (who appears on the track \\"The More I Look\\" on Open the Door). Hodgson continued touring, often playing alone, and frequently joined by his band or a full orchestra. He took part in the Night of the Proms concert series in Belgium and Germany in late 2004, as well as the rock festival Bospop in 2005 with return performances in 2011, 2013 and 2017. On 30 November 2005, he held his first concert in England for over twenty years, at Shepherd's Bush, London. While the performance was filmed and scheduled for a DVD release, the plan was scrapped. Instead, the concert recorded at the Place Des Arts in Montreal, Canada on 6June 2006 was his first DVD, released on 22 August 2006, entitled Take the Long Way Home‚ÄîLive in Montreal. In October 2006, the DVD was certified multi-platinum by the CRIA (Canadian Recording Industry Association). In May 2006, Hodgson was honoured by ASCAP in recognition of his song \\"Give A Little Bit\\" being one of the most played songs in the ASCAP repertoire in 2005. He received another ASCAP award on 9April 2008 for the Gym Class Heroes' song \\"Cupid's Chokehold\\", a remake of Hodgson's \\"Breakfast in America\\", recognised as one of the most played songs in ASCAP's repertoire in 2007. Hodgson participated as a mentor on Canadian Idol along with Dennis DeYoung. He continued mentoring several of the finalists during his 2006 Canadian tour. Hodgson performed at the Concert for Diana at Wembley Stadium, on 1July 2007. He sang a medley of his most popular songs: \\"Dreamer\\", \\"The Logical Song\\", \\"Breakfast in America\\" and \\"Give A Little Bit\\". On 18 September 2007, the DVD Take the Long Way Home‚ÄîLive in Montreal was released worldwide, achieving Platinum status in just seven weeks, reaching No.1 in all Canada, and multi-Platinum and Gold in France and Germany. Hodgson toured the US, Australia, New Zealand, South America, Europe, and Canada in 2010. Though Hodgson's former bandmates in Supertramp announced a 40th Anniversary reunion tour, he was not invited to join them.(21 April 2010). Supertramp snub angers Hodgson, Jam! Music. Hodgson's Classics Live is a collection of recordings taken from solo, band, and orchestra shows from his 2010 world tour. In May 2012, Hodgson was honoured by France as a Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters. This prestigious decoration was established in 1957 by the French Minister of Culture to recognise significant contributions to the arts. Hodgson continued to tour worldwide from 2011 to 2016, including two concerts at the Royal Albert Hall. Hodgson's tour continues into 2017 with announced dates in Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, the UK, Netherlands, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Spain, Monaco and Canada. In December 2017, Hodgson toured with Night of the Proms for 17 shows in Germany and Luxembourg. He was accompanied by saxophonist Michael Ghegan; Emily Bear performed \\"School\\" with him. As related by Subba-Cultcha magazine about Hodgson's concerts: \\"Alternating between electric keys, a grand piano and several guitars, Hodgson effortlessly weaves the music around his audience giving an almost cathartic emotional release in some cases\\"... \\"His instantly recognisable voice and pulsating keys are in as fine a form as you will hear, and the genuine friendliness and personality of Hodgson, comes across in waves from stage to audience.\\" During his concerts, Hodgson often shares stories with the audience of how his songs were written and \\"connects deeply with the fans in a way few stars of his stature do\\". In 2018, Hodgson kicked off his Breakfast in America world tour, in honour of the 40th anniversary of Supertramp's Breakfast in America album. Rolling Stone reviewed the tour favourably. On 4 June 2019, he was decorated with the Order of Arts and Letters by Franck Riester, French minister of Culture, in Paris during a tour at the Olympia. On 25 June 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Roger Hodgson among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

A flower bouquet is a collection of flowers in a creative arrangement. Flower bouquets can be arranged for the decor of homes or public buildings, or may be handheld. Handheld bouquets are classified by several different popular shapes and styles, including nosegay, crescent, and cascading bouquets. Flower bouquets are often given for special occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries or funerals. They are also used extensively in weddings. Bouquets arranged in vases or planters for home decor can be arranged in either traditional or modern styles. Symbolism may be attached to the types of flowers used, according to the culture. History Fresh flowers are arranged in front of houses to celebrate Onam, a major celebration in Kerala, India. A Japanese ikebana flower bouquet in a vase. Beach Wedding Bouquet The arrangement of flowers for home or building decor has a long history throughout the world. The oldest evidence of formal arranging of bouquets in vases comes from ancient Egypt, and depictions of flower arrangements date to the Old Kingdom (~2500 BCE). The sacred lotus was often used, as were herbs, palms, irises, anemones, and narcissus. In some cultures, ancient practises still survive today, for example in ikebana, the art of flower-arranging that comes from Japan. The oldest known book on flower-arranging is Japanese and dates from 1445. Simplicity and linear form are core features of ikebana, which has had a great influence on Western flower arranging since the late 19th century. Flower-arranging as an art form was brought to Japan by Buddhist monks, who learned it while in China. In ancient China, flower-arranging developed into a highly refined art form, based on the principle that life is sacred, including the life of plants, therefore cut flowers were used sparingly in carefully planned arrangements. Flowers were a traditional ritual offering among Buddhists, however, and remain so. In Europe, flower arranging as a formal art was first documented among the Dutch, who \\"in particular, painted wonderful informal arrangements of flowers [...] In the 18th century, arrangements were used to decorate the houses of the wealthy families and the aristocracy.\\" Flower symbolism is common in many cultures, and can be complex. In China, certain flowers symbolize seasons: white plum blossoms represent winter, peach and cherry blossoms represent spring, lotus represents summer, and chrysanthemums the fall. Nosegay The term \\"tussie-mussie\\" is sometimes used interchangeably with nosegay. A nosegay was also known as a \\"talking bouquet\\" or \\"flower poesy\\" during the Victorian era, when they became a popular gift. Traditionally, brides will also carry a small nosegay. Tussie mussies were introduced to England in the early 18th century, and were a fashionable accessory for young women by the early 19th century.Laufer et al. p 44 A tussie mussie is a small circular bouquet like a nosegay, but carries symbolic meaning based upon the language of flowers, where particular flowers represent specific sentiments. They were commonly exchanged by lovers, who sent messages to one another based upon the flowers used in the bouquet. Traditionally, tussie mussies are arranged in a cone- or cornucopia-shaped container, made of tin or silver, with a chain attached for carrying the bouquet.Laufer et al. p 48 Language of flowers Flower symbolism originated in Asia and the Middle East, where certain flowers, such as the lotus, were considered sacred, or at least to be associated with spiritual themes. This was often reflected in artwork, for example the use of bamboo in Chinese art to represent longevity and eternity. The language of flowers was introduced to England in the early 18th century by Mary Wortley, Lady Montague, whose husband was Ambassador to Turkey. By the Victorian era, almost every flower had a specific meaning attached to it. Small nosegay or \\"tussie mussie\\" bouquets might include chamomile flowers, which a woman might send to a romantic interest to tell him \\"Patience\\"; goldenrod represented indecision. Wedding bouquets Traditionally the bride will hold the bouquet, and the maid of honor will hold it during the ceremony. After the wedding the bride will toss it over her shoulder, and it is believed that whoever catches the bouquet is the next in line to be married. This practice may be related to the Golden Apple of Discord myth. =Wedding bouquet shapes= There are many different bridal bouquet styles from which to select. Brides typically choose the shape of their bouquets according to popular trends at the time of their wedding, however some choose bouquets which evoke another time period. While the language of flowers can contribute to a message to be conveyed about the couple, the shapes are a personal preference. The Posy bouquet is typically round in shape and is thought of as modern due to the small size and relative simplicity of the arrangement. It is also popular for the ease of carrying and passing-off during the ceremony. It can be composed of an expensive flower, such as a rose, or can be a sampling of country flowers. The Cascading bouquet is usually a large arrangement which tapers near the bottom. It was popularized as the arrangement of choice for the 1980s at the wedding of Lady Diana Spencer and the Prince of Wales at Westminster Abbey. It can, and is often, made up of many types of flowers and is enhanced with Baby's Breath and different types of greenery, such as ivy. This bouquet became less popular as bridal trends shifted towards simplicity, however it has found a resurgence in recent years. The Presentation bouquet saw a surge in popularity at the turn of the twentieth century. It is most frequently composed of a long-stemmed bud, such as the Calla Lily, and is cradled in the bride's arms, rather than carried by the stems. The following gallery shows popular bride's bouquet shapes, including cascading, hand-tied, nosegay, pomander, flower spray and Biedermeier.

Born in Portsea, Portsmouth, Bremer joined the Royal Naval College as a student in 1797. While serving in the East Indies, he became commander of in 1807. He was promoted to captain in 1814 and was nominated a CB the following year. After becoming commander of HMS Tamar, he was sent to Melville Island, Australia, in 1824 to establish a colony. Under his leadership, the north coast of Australia from 129¬∞ to 135¬∞ longitude was claimed as British territory. Bremer served twice as commander-in-chief of British forces in the First Anglo-Chinese War from 1839 to 1841. During the war, he took formal possession of Hong Kong Island for the United Kingdom in 1841. He was made a KCB the same year. In 1846, he was appointed with Sir Francis Augustus Collier to the joint command of the Channel Squadron and became commodore-superintendent of Woolwich Dockyard from which he retired in 1848. He died in 1850, having risen to the rank of rear-admiral.  Early career  Bremer was born on 26 September 1786 in Portsea, Hampshire, England.Laughton, J.

He was the only son of Royal Navy Lieutenant James Bremer (who went missing in the East Indiaman Halswell off the coast of Dorset, England, on 6 January 1786) and his wife Ann, daughter of Captain James Norman. In 1794, as a young lad aged around 12 years old, he joined the Royal Navy as a first-class volunteer on board the flagship of HMS Sandwich at the Nore of Rear-Admiral Skeffington Lutwidge, from which he was discharged in June 1795. On 8 October 1797, he became a student of the Royal Naval College in Portsmouth, and re-embarked on 2 April 1802 as a midshipman on board HMS Endymion of Captain Philip Durham. Until July 1805, Bremer served in the flagship of HMS Isis under Vice-Admiral James Gambier and Rear-Admiral Edward Thornbrough, on the Newfoundland and North Sea stations. Shortly after passing his examination, he was appointed sub-lieutenant of the gun-brig HMS Rapid. On 3 August 1805, he became a lieutenant on board HMS Captain as part of William Cornwallis' force in pursuing a French fleet in Brest, France.O'Byrne, William Richard (1849). \\"Bremer, James John Gordon\\". A Naval Biographical Dictionary. John Murray. p. 120. On 9 May 1806, Bremer was appointed to HMS Diana of Captain Thomas James Maling in the Mediterranean Station, from where he proceeded to the Davis Strait.

On 28 May 1807, he was appointed to the Psych√© of Captain William Wooldridge in the East Indies, where he became commander of HMS Rattlesnake on 13 October. He became a captain on 7 June 1814. On 4 June 1815, he was nominated a Companion of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath (CB).  Australia  On 18 September 1823, just before his 37th birthday, Bremer was appointed commander of HMS Tamar. In February 1824, he was sent to Melville Island, Australia, to establish a colony. The site was intended as a military settlement to secure British trade in the region. It was hoped that a market would open to British merchants in the Malay Archipelago.Scott, Ernest (1988) [1933].

After sailing through the Torres Strait, he arrived in Port Essington on 20 September. The north coast of Australia from 129¬∞ to 135¬∞ longitude was declared British territory. Bremer rejected Port Essington as a settlement due to its lack of fresh drinking water. On 26 September, the party landed at King Cove in Melville Island to build a settlement, which was named Fort Dundas on 21 October. However, the site was unhealthy, expensive to maintain, and did not develop into an advantageous commercial trading post. In November 1828, orders were given to abandon the post. In November 1824, Bremer sailed for India where he served in the First Anglo-Burmese War. On 25 January 1836, he was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order (KCH). In 1837, Port Essington was again selected as a possible trading station by Baron Glenelg. Bremer, who commanded the Alligator and Britomart, was again given charge of the expedition. He established a new post in October 1838, calling it Port Victoria. The port was active until 1843 and by 1849, Port Essington was abandoned after it had no commercial or military value. Under the encouragement of New South Wales Governor George Gipps, Bremer left Port Essington for China in June 1839, with the ships under his command, after news of trouble in the Chinese city of Canton.

It was located in the valley of the Murghab River which has its sources in the mountains of Afghanistan, and passes through Murghab District in modern Afghanistan, and then reaches the oasis of Merv in modern Turkmenistan. Margiana bordered Parthia to the south-west, Aria in the south, Bactria in the east and Sogdia in the north. History =Ancient period= Historians currently disagree as to the exact history of Margiana prior to the Achaemenid conquest. It is considered part of a Bronze Age civilisation, the Bactria‚ÄìMargiana Archaeological Complex (short BMAC), also known as the Oxus civilisation. Some historians have argued that a kingdom was established and an urban society had begun to develop surrounding the oasis. It has also been postulated the region existed as part of a major Iranian state centred in Chorasmia that controlled Aria, Sogdia, Parthia and Margiana. Other historians have noted that whilst advanced irrigation had begun in the 7th century BC, the existence of such a state is unlikely. It has been also suggested that Margiana was part of the satrapy of Bactria under the Median Empire.Herzfeld (1968), p. 344 =Achaemenid period= Behistun relief of Fr√¢da, a king of Margiana circa 522 BC. Label: \\"This is Fr√¢da. He lied, saying \\"I am king of Margiana.\\"\\" Margiana was conquered by the Persian king Cyrus the Great between 545 and 539 BC and remained as part of the satrapy of Bactria.Dani (1999), pp. 40‚Äì42 Cyrus also founded the city of Merv.Williams (2012), p. 54. After Darius the Great's victory over the Magian usurper, Gaumata, in September 522 BC, revolts spread throughout the empire.Rawlinson (1867) The revolt in Margiana, led by a certain Fr√¢da (Phraates),Young (1988), p. 53 was suppressed almost immediately, in December 521 BC by Dadarsi, the Satrap of Bactria.Asheri et al. (2007), p. 533 In the Aramaic version of the Behistun Inscription, it is claimed that 55,423 Margians were killed and 6,972 taken captive in the aftermath of the revolt.Lendering (2011) Margiana was separated from the satrapy of Bactria and joined to the satrapy of Aria at some point after the rule of Darius the Great.Frye (1983), p. 112 Following the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC, in which Alexander the Great defeated Darius III, Darius III began his retreat to Bactria, however he was overthrown by the Satrap of Bactria, Bessus, who continued the retreat eastward through Aria and Margiana.Lendering (1998) Bessus, who had expected an attack from Alexander along the Silk Road, was surprised when Alexander had advanced through Gedrosia and Arachosia and crossed the Hindu Kush mountains in 329 BC to invade Bactria. Bessus fled north to Sogdia where he too was betrayed and was handed over to Alexander by his courtiers, Spitamenes and Datames.Lendering (2000) In July 329 BC, as Alexander founded the city of Alexandria Eschate on the northern border of Sogdia, Spitamenes led a revolt and besieged the Sogdian capital of Maracanda. A Scythian incursion into Sogdia prevented Alexander from responding personally, however, once he had defeated the Scythians in the Battle of Jaxartes, he marched south to relieve Maracanda causing Spitamenes to move south and attack Balkh in the winter of 329 BC. In the spring of 328 BC, Alexander sent his general Craterus to fortify Margiana, where he established a garrison in Merv and re-founded the city as Alexandria in Margiana.Lendering (2006) Alexander's general Coenus defeated Spitamenes in the Battle of Gabai in December 328 BC, and subsequently in the following year Sogdia was merged with Bactria to form a single satrapy under the rule of Philip. =Hellenistic Period= Upon Alexander's death in 323 BC, the empire was partitioned between his generals at the Partition of Babylon and according to some historians, Philip remained as satrap of Bactria, however, it has also been suggested that he was in fact only satrap of Sogdia. Disagreements between the generals led to another meeting and in the Partition of Triparadisus in 321 BC, Philip was replaced as satrap of Bactria and Sogdia by Stasanor. During the Wars of the Diadochi, Stasanor remained neutral, however after the Babylonian War of 311‚Äì309 BC, Margiana came under the control of Seleucus I Nicator. In c. 280 BC, Margiana was devastated by the nomadic Parni tribes and several cities were destroyed.Dani (1999), p. 90 Seleucus responded by sending his general Demodamas to repel the nomads.Frye (1983), p.208 Under Seleucus' successor, Antiochus I Soter, the oasis of Alexandria in Margiana was surrounded by a wall over 300 km long and the city was re-built and re-founded as Antiochia in Margiana as the capital of a separate satrapy of Margiana in an effort to secure communications and trade routes from Antiochus' capital in Mesopotamia to the far east.Frye (1983), p.156 Margiana was successfully defended by Diodotus, the satrap of Bactria, against an invasion by the Parni in c. 239/238 BC.Lerner (1999), p. 29 The invasion demonstrated that Seleucus II Callinicus was unable to respond to threats in the East and therefore Diodotus, who had begun pushing for his independence in c. 245 BC, abandoned hopes of remaining part of the Seleucid Empire and declared himself king, thus establishing what is now known as the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom.Bopearachchi (1995), pp. 422‚Äì423 Margiana was conquered by the Parthians under Mithridates I of Parthia in c. 170 BC. The defeat of the Yuezhi people in 175 BC caused many Yuezhi to flee westwards, displacing the Saka as a result, leading to a mass movement of Saka and Yuezhi towards Sogdia and Bactria. Around 140 BC the Saka invaded Parthian territory through Margiana, venturing as far as Media in central Iran and continued to harass the Parthians until 124 BC, during which they defeated and killed two successive Parthian kings.Wilcox (1986), p.15 The Yuezhi, who had settled in Sogdia along the Oxus, controlled Margiana until 115 BC when Mithridates II of Parthia re-established control over the east, forcing the Yuezhi to move south into Bactria. Strabo 11.8.1 In 53 BC, 10,000 Roman prisoners captured by the Parthians after the Battle of Carrhae in Upper Mesopotamia were settled in Antiochia in Margiana.Rawlinson (1873) The Yuezhi went on to conquer the remaining Greek territories in Paropamisadae and establish the Kushan Empire. =Post-Hellenistic period= The Kushans returned to Margiana in the 1st century AD and helped the satrap Sanabares declare himself king who ruled from ca. 50 AD to 65 AD.Chiesa (1982), pp. 15‚Äì22 At the onset of the 3rd century AD, Margiana had been restored as a vassal of the Parthian Empire, but continued to exist as a \\"virtually independent state\\".Dani (1999), p. 481 After Ardashir I's victory over the last Parthian king, Artabanus V, at the Battle of HormozdgƒÅn in 224 AD, Margiana, ruled by a certain king Ardashir, submitted to Ardashir I and accepted vassalage.Frye (1983), p. 295 The vassal kingdom was permitted to continue minting its own coinage until it was formally annexed by Shapur I in c. 260 AD who granted control of Margiana to his son, Narseh, as part of the province of Hind, Sagistan and Turan.Lukonin (1983), p. 729 In the fifth century, during the reign of the Sasanian king Bahram V, Margiana and the northern territories were invaded and plundered by the Hephthalites, also known as the White Huns.Rawlinson (1875) Bahram, after initially sending an offer of peace, led a surprise attack on the Hepthalites and massacred them whilst they camped and then pursued them as they attempted to flee back to their own territory. Bahram himself pursued the Hepthalites to the river Oxus in Margiana and sent one of his generals beyond the river who crippled them greatly. Despite this, the Hepthalites returned in around 480 AD and occupied Margiana until 565 AD. In 642 AD, after the Sasanian disaster at the hands of the Rashidun Caliphate at the Battle of Nihawand, much like Darius III, the last Sasanian king, Yazdegerd III, fled eastward and arrived in Margiana in 651 AD. Yazdegerd was well received by Mahoe Suri, the marzban of Merv, however, upon arrival Yazdegerd appointed his courtier Farrukhzad as marzban and ordered that Mahoe give absolute control of the city over to him. Mahoe refused and Farrukhzad advised the king to retreat to Tabaristan, which he ignored.Pourshariati (2008), pp. 259‚Äì260 Farrukhzad then left for Tabaristan, where he would later become king himself.Pourshariati (2008), pp. 260‚Äì261 As the Muslim army approached, Mahoe plotted with the Hepthalite ruler Nezak Tarkan to overthrow Yazdegerd who later discovered the plot and retreated to Marwir-Rawdh in southern Margiana. Mahoe agreed to pay tribute to the Rashidun general Ahnaf ibn Qais who began to consolidate Islam in Margiana and awaited reinforcements.Farrokh & Frye (2007) Ahnaf captured Merw i-Rud, forcing Yazdegerd to flee to Balkh with his remaining supporters. Ahnaf was ordered by the Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab to remain at Merv and not pursue Yazdegerd. However, upon learning that Yazdegerd had formed an alliance with Hepthalites beyond Margiana and was approaching Merv, Ahnaf rallied his forces and defeated Yazdegerd at the Battle of Oxus River. After his defeat, the Sasanian king attempted to hide in a mill where he was killed by a Margian miller, bringing the Sasanian Empire to an end.Fowlkes-Childs (2003) Religion Margiana's position along the Silk Road led to the development of a diverse religious demography in the period prior to the Islamic Conquest. Although most of the population in Margiana practised Zoroastrianism, Buddhist, Christian, Manichaean and Jewish communities also existed and thrived in Margiana. Buddhist monasteries are known to have existed in Margiana,Foltz (1999), p. 47 and the city of Merv acted as a major centre of Buddhist learning. A Manichaean community is known to have existed from the mid 3rd century AD. According to Al-Biruni, Christianity had spread to Margiana within 200 years of the birth of Christ.Dani (1999), pp. 482‚Äì483 In the 3rd century AD, at least one Christian monastery was founded and a reference to a diocese based in Merv is first mentioned in 334. A Nestorian diocese, based in the city of Merv, is known to have existed from 424 AD,Chabot, 285 and it later became a metropolitan province in 554. The uncommon name of the first recorded bishop of Merv, Bar Shaba, which means \\"son of the deportation\\", would suggest that the Christian community in Margiana may have been deported from Roman territory. A diocese of Merw i-Rud in southern Margiana also existed in 554.Chabot, 366 See also *Bactria‚ÄìMargiana Archaeological Complex *History of Turkmenistan References Sources        * Strabo (1924). H.

Although never engaged in any major actions, Brisbane served under both Lord Howe and Horatio Nelson and performed important work at the Cape of Good Hope, prior to the Battle of Copenhagen and in the Adriatic campaign of 1807‚Äì1814. In later life Brisbane became commander-in-chief in the East Indies. He contracted dysentery in Burma and arrived in Port Jackson in Sydney aboard , where he died on 19 December 1826. He was a cousin of General Sir Thomas Brisbane who had earlier been governor of New South Wales. Career James Brisbane was born in 1774, the fifth son of Admiral John Brisbane and the younger brother of future Admiral Charles Brisbane. In 1787, Brisbane went to sea aboard and by 1794 he was signal midshipman aboard Lord Howe's flagship . Brisbane served in this capacity at the Glorious First of June, where Queen Charlotte was heavily engaged and badly damaged. In the aftermath of the battle, Brisbane was promoted to lieutenant and was sent to the Cape of Good Hope, later joining George Elphinstone's flagship and being present at the surrender of a Dutch squadron in Saldanha Bay. Squadron attacking Fort Maurigio in 1814, from a sketch by James Brisbane Brisbane was promoted to commander and given command of one of the captured Dutch ships, the sloop , which the Royal Navy renamed Daphne. When she reached Plymouth in September 1797 the Navy paid off Daphne and Brisbane was put on half-pay. Brisbane remained on half-pay until 1800; he married Jemima Ann Ventham shortly before he returned to sea in command of . Cruizer was attached to Sir Hyde Parker's Baltic fleet on commissioning and Brisbane came under the direct command of Admiral Horatio Nelson, who used Cruizer to take soundings and make charts of the approaches to Copenhagen prior to the British attack on the city at the Battle of Copenhagen. Brisbane impressed his superiors in this duty and in 1801 was made a post-captain and commanded under Admiral Thomas Totty until the admiral's death. Between 1803 and 1805, Brisbane commanded the Kent sea fencibles and in 1807 took command of off Ireland. In 1809, he moved to , and commanded her in the Adriatic Sea and Ionian Sea in the early stages of the Adriatic campaign of 1807‚Äì1814. There Brisbane captured the off Valona. He later participated in the capture of several of the Ionian Islands and remained in the region until 1811, becoming an expert in coastal operations. In late 1811, Brisbane took command of , and stayed with her for a year. He then transferred to the command of the newly built in the Channel Fleet. In 1813 he returned to the Mediterranean Sea, where he remained for the rest of the war. A squadron under his command, composed of Pembroke in company with Alcmene and on 11 April 1814 captured Fortune, Notre Dame de Leusainte, and a settee of unknown name, at Fort Maurigio, in the Gulf of Genoa, near Monaco. The squadron silenced the fort's guns, and attacked 20 vessels; 4 were captured, and the cargoes of another 15 taken off ships whose crews scuttled them. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 16 September 1815. In 1816, Pembroke was attached to the force under Lord Exmouth that bombarded Algiers and on his return home, as captain of , Brisbane was knighted. In 1825, Brisbane was made commander-in- chief of the East Indies Station and sailed there as commodore, arriving in 1826 and taking part in the latter stages of the First Anglo-Burmese War, in which he had some success in riverine operations. During the campaign however he contracted a fatal illness and died from it aboard in Sydney in 1826. Brisbane is remembered as a popular and capable commander whose expertise was focused on coastal and riverine operations, which he conducted with success throughout his career.

The game was sponsored by Smiths' British snack Quavers (now owned by Walkers), and the plot revolves around the then Quavers mascot \\"Colin Curly' losing his Quavers packets down a giant ant hill. The player is tasked with controlling 'G.I. Ant', a large soldier ant, to recover the Quavers by solving a series of puzzles. The SNES version lacks the Quavers branding, and instead the aim is to recover bundles of cash dropped down the ant hill by Captain Rat. Gameplay The game consists of 100 levels of increasing complexity over nine different themed worlds. Each level features several interconnected platforms holding a number of \\"dominoes\\". The aim is to rearrange the dominoes, such that with a single push, all of the dominoes are toppled, thus opening the exit to the next level. There are 11 different types of domino, identified by red and yellow patterns, each with different actions. The player controls G.I. Ant, who can move certain dominoes by carrying them one at a time. Various factors can result in failure to complete a level. As well as toppling all of the dominoes, the player must be able to access the exit door once the dominoes have fallen. For instance, the player will be unable to reach the exit if a ledge leading to the exit has been destroyed, or if a gap leading to the exit has not been bridged, or if a line of dominoes lie across the exit. G.I. Ant may die by falling from a large height, by falling off the bottom of the screen, or by being crushed under a falling domino. The player is then greeted with the message \\"You Failed, You Died\\" and has to restart the level. Also, the level will be failed if any dominoes are destroyed by landing one domino on top of another. Each level has a time limit during which it must be completed. However, if the time runs out the player is still able to continue with the puzzle if they wish. By pausing the game once the time has run out, a small hint will be displayed, giving advice on how to complete the level. As a side note, the hint for level 98 informs the player that the game's designer cannot remember how to complete the level without trickery (\\"Use a drop! There is a way to make it work with a push, but I can't find it!\\"). The themed worlds, in order, are an industrial complex, an Aztec world, a space station, an electronic world, a Greek temple, a Medieval castle, a Meccano-inspired world, a dungeon and a Japanese temple. Each world has 11 levels, making a total of 99 regular levels. A packet of Colin's Quavers is retrieved after each world, with nine packets in all to be collected. Many of the early levels are tutorials demonstrating how each type of domino will act. Often there is only a single solution to each level, though some levels have multiple solutions. The final level, level 100, must be completed using dominoes with hidden markings. A password system allows the player to continue an earlier game, without having to restart from the first level. Additionally, upon completing a level the player gains a token, which once a level has been failed, allows the player to return to the point before the domino push, rather than having to return to the initial state of the level. Production Issues Creative differences between RedRat Software and Ocean Software around branding and graphical changes overshadowed this title and a breakdown between both parties occurred once legal action was taken by RedRat to regain creative control/claim a breach of contract. The legal battle led to the downfall of RedRat Software, who were unable to fund continual legal costs vs the much deeper pockets of Ocean Software. Reception The game was reviewed in 1993 in Dragon #193 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in the \\"Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. Entertainment Weekly gave the game a B- and wrote that \\"The theme of Pushover (Ocean of America, for Super NES) is ingenious ‚Äî players have to line up 10 kinds of dominoes, then get them all to fall with a single push ‚Äî but the static execution will have small kids dozing off way before their bedtime.\\" References External links * Category:Ocean Software games Category:Amiga games Category:Atari ST games Category:DOS games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:1992 video games Category:Piko Interactive games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Advergames ","title":"Pushover (video game)"},{"id":"2511354","text":"The Franklin W. Olin Foundation, founded as the Olin Foundation in 1938 by Franklin W. Olin, was an independent grantmaking foundation from its founding in 1938 until it spent down its corpus and closed down in 2005.  History  Olin Hall, the Chemical Engineering building at Cornell University. Olin used the foundation for personal giving, including gifts for a chemical engineering building in the Engineering Quadrangle at Cornell University and a vocational high school in Alton, Illinois. In creating the foundation, Olin passed control of what would become the Olin Corporation to his sons, Spencer and John, while donating controlling shares to the foundation. \\"The old man then took his marbles out of the game,\\" as Fortune described the transaction. \\"He plunked his stock into a charitable foundation. . . . If the boys did not want control of the company to pass to the foundation on his death, they‚Äôd jolly well have to hustle up the money to buy back the shares.\\" The Olin sons did that, which left $50 million in the foundation's corpus, making it one of the largest foundations in the country. After Olin died in 1951, his three trustees‚ÄîCharles L. Horn, an Olin business associate; tax attorney James O. Wynn, and financial consultant Ralph Clark‚Äîcontinued Olin's grant program under the same principles as his Cornell gift: funding academic buildings while paying the full cost, including equipment and furnishings. They hired no staff and administered the program at the trustee level. Grants to vocational schools in the segregated South required that schools be racially integrated. In the 1970s, new board members were elected: business executive Carlton T. Helming, lawyer Lawrence W. Milas, and business executive William B. Horn (son of previous board member Charles). Horn and Helming were later replaced by William Norden and William Schmidt. They continued the previous pattern of grantmaking until 1997. From 1938 to 1997, the Olin Foundation distributed grants for 78 buildings at 58 institutions, including F. W. Olin Hall at the University of Denver and the Olin Fine Arts Center at Washington and Jefferson College. ‚ÄúWe always had a bias toward supporting science and engineering schools because Mr. Olin was an engineer,‚Äù Milas said.  Olin College  In the early 1990s, the board of the Olin Foundation began to worry about the perpetuation of donor intent in subsequent generations. \\"We were concerned about how we were going to find people committed to continue the grant program, who wouldn't come in with their own agenda, their own baggage, and try to change things around,\\" Milas said. \\"With the escalation of building costs, would we be able to sustain that grant program? We were locked into what we had as a private foundation. Would we remain relevant if we couldn't substantially grow our assets?\\" The board evaluated options, and decided to pursue an idea that Olin had suggested in the 1940s: starting a new college. In 1997, they chartered the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering and made an initial gift of $200 million. Milas was president initially, but he soon hired Richard Miller as the college's president and first full-time employee. In 2005, after the college had been up and running for several years, the foundation dissolved itself and transferred the balance of its endowment, about $250 million, to the college. The foundation closed in the same year as the John M. Olin Foundation, which was established by Franklin's son John. The John M. Olin Foundation also shut down for donor intent reasons, but the two foundations were entirely independent and unrelated, except for the family connection of their founders.

Outside of North America and Britain it was, until 1962, marketed under the nameplate Renault Floride. Name Renault was envious of the growing success in North America of the Volkswagen Bug/Beetle and were looking for ways they might match the Volkswagen's success with their own Renault Dauphine. At a convention of North American distributors that took place in Florida, Renault's US dealers called for the creation of a Dauphine coup√©/cabriolet which would improve Renault's image in the critical US market. Renault's chairman, Pierre Dreyfus, agreed, and since the concept had been born at a convention in Florida the car instantly became known within the company as the \\"Renault Floride\\".Floride is the French word for Florida The \\"Floride\\" name was considered unsuitable for 49 of the 50 states of the U.S., however, since it could have implied disrespect to states other than Florida. For this reason an alternative name, \\"Caravelle\\", was from the start used for North America and for other major markets (including the UK) where the principal language was a form of English.AutoPlus n¬∞1182, page 62, \\"Il y a 52 ans, Renault lance la Floride au long cours\\" Renault Floride S convertible (with hardtop). Renault Caravelle coupe. The sloping rear roof line was partially \\"squared off\\" in order to improve rear-seat headroom. Renault Caravelle cabriolet. Launch The Floride was unveiled at the 1958 Paris Motor Show. A small rear-engined design by Pietro Frua at Carrozzeria Ghia, it used the floorpan and engine of the Renault Dauphine sedan. The Floride was launched in the United States and Canada as the Renault Caravelle a year after its introduction in Europe. Specifications =Bodies= The car was offered as a 2+2 coupe, a 2+2 cabriolet and as a convertible, the latter being a cabriolet with a removable hardtop. The wheelbase was shared with the Renault Dauphine but longer overhangs meant that overall the Floride was longer by a significant , as well as being slightly lower and very slightly wider. =Engine= At launch the Floride, like the Dauphine on which it was based, came with an four-cylinder water-cooled engine mounted at the back of the car. However, the power unit on the Floride was fed using a Solex 32 mm carburetor as against the 28 mm diameter of the Solex carburetor on the Dauphine. The Florides making their French show debut on the stand at the 1958 Paris Motor Show came with a claimed power output of SAE. Changes in the way that power output was computed by European automakers did not take place overnight, and data from automakers provided during the late 1950s and early 1960s, as well as sources derived from then, usually do not spell out the computation basis used when quoting Horsepower (hp). Practice in France (and Britain) had since 1945 tended to follow North American practice, measuring \\"SAE\\" gross power whereby prior to measurement the engine was stripped of \\"auxiliary elements\\" such as filters, silencers/mufflers, pumps, dynamo/alternator and transmission. By removing most of the elements that absorbed engine power before it ever came near to the drive shaft, it was possible to maximise the horse-power figure. At the end of the 1950s French and British automakers moved towards the (originally German) DIN standard which measured the power arriving at the drive shaft without removing the \\"auxiliary elements\\" from the engine. In practice there was far more variation in how horse power was measured and quoted than this necessarily simplistic summary allows, and there is no universal formula for converting an SAE horsepower figure to a DIN horsepower figure, but a reduction in the power figure quoted of perhaps 15% when switching to a DIN figure in most cases provides a reasonable approximation. By the time deliveries commenced, in early summer 1959, it was also possible for customers to specify a performance version, engineered by Amedee Gordini, which produced SAE by means of various modifications to the inlet manifold and camshaft, and a compression ratio raised from 7.6:1 to 8.0:1. =Transmission= Power was delivered to the rear wheels via a three-speed manual transmission with synchromesh on the upper two ratios. For a supplement of 200 New Francs customers could instead specify a four-speed transmission on the slightly heavier coup√© version of the car. Having regard to the car's power-to-weight ratio most customers chose to pay extra for the four speed gear box. Subcontracted production Although designed by Frua of Italy, the car's body was constructed locally, by the automobile body maker Soci√©t√© des usines Chausson, based in Asni√®res-sur-Seine at the northern edge of Paris, and known in France as the producer of many of the school bus bodies used for transporting children in country areas. Following the rapid economic growth experienced by France during the 1950s, and despite the fall-off in demand for the 4CV and the lacklustre market performance of the Fr√©gate, thanks to the success of the recently launched Dauphine Renault still found themselves, in the second half of the decade, seriously short of production capacity. The main Billancourt plant,renault.com built on the Seguin island in the middle of the River Seine, was particularly ill-suited to further expansion. A new plant had been opened at Flins in 1952 and a second would follow near Le Havre in 1964, but neither of these addressed the challenge of finding somewhere to assemble the Floride in 1958. The heavy engineering company of Brissonneau and Lotz, better known as a manufacturer of rolling stock for the railways, had launched a small cabriolet sports car in 1956, based on the mechanical underpinnings of the Renault 4CV, but the Brissonneau coup√© had been a tentative project and few cars were sold. Renault now persuaded Brissonneau to abandon their own automobile project and adapt their facilities for assembly of the Floride. Brissonneau's long standing experience with railway locomotives provided abundant relevant experience at operational and workforce level, and Renault contributed much of the investment which during 1958 and 1959 saw the main Creil plant of Brissonneau, comprising 190,000 m2 of which 41,280 m2 were covered, transformed into a production facility for the Floride: the Floride, later rebadged as the Renault Caravelle, would continue to be assembled by Brissonneau and Lotz until it was withdrawn in 1968.fccdf.free.fr: Brissonneau & Lotz: History of the Creil facility (in French) Upgrades In October 1959, ready for the 1960 model year, the Floride, along with the Renault Dauphine, appeared with significant suspension improvements. The new suspension was conceived by the by now almost legendary automotive engineer Jean-Albert Gr√©goire and baptised by Renault \\"Suspension A√©rostable\\", being intended to improve the car's ride and road holding. The addition of extra rubber springs at the front reduced roll and auxiliary air spring units (mounted inboard of the conventional coils) at the rear gave the rear wheels a small degree of negative camber and increased cornering grip. In March 1962, the Caravelle received a new 956 cc engine that would be also used by the new Renault 8 from June. Although the new \\"Sierra\\" series five-bearing engine shared no components with the existing 845 cc Dauphine engine, it was conceptually very similar: the engine size was chosen in order to come in (slightly) below the top of the 5CV car tax band in France. It had a sealed cooling system as well as a new front suspension, new rear geometry, new steering, and a new gear linkage. Moving the radiator behind the engine also freed up an extra 12 cm of space behind the front seat. Maximum power output increased to . Four-speed transmission, already included in the price at no extra cost on some export markets, now came as part of the standard with the new engine even for French buyers, although bottom gear still made do without synchromesh. The upgraded cars, first presented at the 1962 Geneva Motor Show, now featured disc brakes on all four wheels: the Floride was the first French volume car to benefit from this enhancement which also reduced unsprung weight by approximately 6 kg. The Caravelle name also replaced the Floride name in all markets from 1962 onwards. In 1964, another R8-derived engine of 1108 cc was introduced to the Caravelle, producing . This model was tested by the British \\"Autocar\\" magazine in November 1965. The car had a top speed of and accelerated from 0- in 17.8 seconds. An \\"overall\\" fuel consumption of was recorded. The Caravelle's performance closely matched that of the contemporary Triumph Spitfire 4 under most headings, though the Spitfire was a couple of mph ahead on top speed. The British car market was still protected by tariffs at this time, but even allowing for that the Renault looks expensive in this company: The Caravelle came with a UK recommended price of ¬£1039 as against ¬£666 for the Spitfire 4. Commercial Production got under way slowly, with only 3,777 cars completed in 1959. However, in 1960, following the important \\"A√©rostable\\" suspension upgrades, Renault produced 36,156 Florides. By the mid-1960s, the Caravelle, which had been fashionably styled at launch, was looking dated, while the reduction and elimination of internal tariffs within the Common Market led to intensified competition in France for buyers of inexpensive sports cars, notably from Italy. Between 1966 and 1967, annual production tumbled from 4,880 to 2,991. During 1968, only 1,438 were produced, and it was during the summer of that year that Renault withdrew the Caravelle.

In the 8th century BC, Cotyora (ŒöŒøœÑœçœâœÅŒ±) was founded by the Miletians as one of a string of colonies along the Black Sea coast. The Diodorus Siculus write that it was a colony of the Sinopians.Diodorus Siculus, Library, ¬ß 14.31.1 Xenophon's Anabasis relates that the Ten Thousand rested there for 45 days before embarking for home. Olshausen, Eckart, \\"Cotyora\\" in Brill's New Pauly, Antiquity Anabasis V.5.3fEncyclopedia Britannica Eleventh Edition, s.v. Ordu Strabo also mentions it.XII.3.17 Under Pharnaces I of Pontus, Cotyora was united in a synoikismos with Cerasus. Arrian, in the Periplus of the Euxine Sea (131 CE), describes it as a village \\"and not a large one.\\"16.3 Translated in Arrian: Periplus Ponti Euxini, edited and translated by Aidan Liddle (London: Bristol Classical Press, 2003), p. 75 Suda mentioned that it was also called Cytora (ŒöœçœÑœâœÅŒ±).Suda, ka.2170 The area came under the control of the Danishmends, then the Seljuk Turks in 1214 and 1228, and the Hacƒ±emiroƒüullarƒ± Beylik in 1346. Afterwards, it passed to the dominion of the Ottomans in 1461 along with the Empire of Trabzon. The modern city was founded by the Ottomans as Bayramlƒ± near Eskipazar as a military outpost west of Ordu. In 1869, the city's name was changed to Ordu and it was united with the districts of Bolaman, Per≈üembe, Ulubey, Hansamana (G√∂lk√∂y), and Aybastƒ±. At the turn of the 20th century, the city was more than half Christian (Greek and Armenian), and was known for its Greek schools. On 04 Nisan 1921, Ordu province was created by separating from Trebizond Vilayet. Archaeology In 2016, archaeologist discovered a marble statue of Cybele. In 2018, at the same site, they also discovered sculptures of Pan and Dionysus.Dionysus, Pan sculptures found at site of 2,100-year-old goddess Kybele in northern Turkey Ordu today Old houses in Ta≈üba≈üƒ±/Altƒ±nordu. Ordu Municipality The view of the city from Boztepe. The Saƒüra factory shop, selling many varieties of chocolate-covered hazelnuts, is one of the town's attractions. The Boztepe aerial tramway is another popular attraction which is set to become a modern symbol for the city. Local music is typical of the Black Sea region, including the kemen√ße. The cuisine is primarily based on local vegetables and includes both typical Turkish dishes ‚Äî such as pide and kebab ‚Äî and more interesting fare such as plain or caramel 'burnt ice-cream'. Economy Ordu is famous for hazelnuts, producing about 25 percent of the worldwide crop. The province relies on the crop for up to 80% of its economic activity. Turkey as a whole produces about 75 percent of the world's hazelnuts. As of 1920, Ordu was one of the few producers of white green beans, which were exported to Europe. Ordu also had mulberry tree plantations for sericulture. Today, the city is partially industrialized and a member of the Anatolian Tigers with its 7 companies.

Early life Michael Gordon was born in Florida on July 20, 1956, and grew up in Nicaragua and on the outskirts of Managua in an Eastern European Jewish community before moving to Miami Beach at age eight. Gordon's music is an outgrowth of his experience with underground rock bands in New York City and his formal training in composition at Yale where he studied with Martin Bresnick. Bang on a Can Gordon is one of the founders and artistic directors of New York's Bang on a Can Festival, alongside fellow composers Julia Wolfe‚Äîhis wife‚Äîand David Lang. He has collaborated with them on several projects. The opera The Carbon Copy Building, a collaboration with comic book artist Ben Katchor, received the 2000 Village Voice Obie Award for Best New American Work. A projected comic strip accompanies and interacts with the singers, and the frames fall away in the telling of the story. Gordon, Wolfe and Lang subsequently collaborated with librettist Deborah Artman on the 'oratorio' Lost Objects, the recording of which was released in summer 2001 (Teldec New Line). A further project is Shelter, a multi-media work that was commissioned by the ensemble musikFabrik and features the Scandinavian vocalists Trio Mediaeval in a staged spectacle that, in the words of librettist Deborah Artman, \\"evokes the power and threat of nature, the soaring frontier promise contained in the framing of a new house, the pure aesthetic beauty of blueprints, the sweet architecture of sound and the uneasy vulnerability that underlies even the safety of our sleep.\\" Shelter was premiered in Cologne in Germany in spring 2005, and received its US premiere in November 2005. Both Shelter and Carbon Copy Building were staged by New York's Ridge Theater, in collaboration with Laurie Olinder (visual graphics), Bill Morrison (film-maker) and Bob McGrath (director), with whom Gordon has often worked. The opera Chaos, with libretto by Matthew Maguire premiered at The Kitchen in New York in the autumn of 1998 with stage direction by Bob McGrath. The work, which opened to rave reviews and packed houses, is a fast-paced science fiction spectacle in 25 short scenes. In 2017 Chinese singer Gong Linna premiered Cloud River Mountain, written by the three Bang on a Can composers in addition to Lao Luo. They also premiere Road Trip, a celebration of Bang on a Can's 30-year journey, together at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in October 2017. Music Tuneful, rhythmic and raw, Gordon's music has embraced elements of dissonance, minimalism, modality and popular culture for a bold and direct sound. His music has been presented at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Carnegie Hall, The Proms, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Sydney 2000 Olympic Arts Festival, the Kennedy Center, The Kitchen, the K√∂lner Philharmonie, Royal Albert Hall, the Bonn Oper, and the Jewish Museum Vienna, as well as at the Rotterdam, Edinburgh, St. Petersburg, Holland, Adelaide, Huddersfield, Settembre Musica and Dresden music festivals. His music has been choreographed by Eliot Feld, The Royal Ballet, Emio Greco  PC, Wayne McGregor (for Stuttgart Ballet, Random Dance), Pina Bausch's Tanztheater Wuppertal, Heinz Spoerli (for Z√ºrich Ballet), Ashley Page (for The Royal Ballet and the Scottish Ballet), and Club Guy & Roni,. In 2017 Douglas Lee choreographed a new Gordon score for the Ballett Z√ºrich, and in 2018 Brian Brooks choreographs another new score for the Miami City Ballet. Gordon is a featured artist in the repertoires of Ensemble Modern, Alarm Will Sound, and the Kronos Quartet. =Notable works= Since 1991 he has worked extensively with video. His work Van Gogh Video Opera, a collaboration with video-artist Elliott Caplan, was premiered to critical acclaim in New York in 1991 and received its European premiere in Vienna in 1992. Other works with Caplan include Grand Dairy, based on a diner on New York's Lower East Side, which was produced in Vienna in 1996, and Weather (German Tour 1997), in which the 16 string players of Ensemble Resonanz perform on a vertical stage surrounded by video panels. The recording of Weather is available on Arthrob/Nonesuch Records. In 1997 he also worked with playwright Anna Deavere Smith on House Arrest, First Edition, which premiered at the Arena Stage Theater in Washington, DC. Gordon's percussion sextet Timber was written for the percussion ensembles Slagwerk Den Haag and Mantra Percussion. This work, an evening-length piece for six 2x4s, toured with dance throughout 2009‚Äì10 and was premiered in its concert-version in June 2011. The full percussion sextet was released on Cantaloupe Music in 2011, and, in 2014‚Äì15, it was heard all around the world, in Walt Disney Concert Hall, performed by So Percussion and members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, in Belgium, by Ictus, and in Scandinavia, by Nordic Seks. Other recent pieces for single-instrument ensembles include Rushes for seven bassoons and Amplified for four electric guitars, in which he pushes the boundaries of the sonic possibilities of both instruments. Decasia, a large-scale symphony with projections, commissioned by the Europ√§ischer Musikmonat 2001 for the Basel Sinfonietta, was also staged by the Ridge Theater. The orchestra sits on a triangular pyramid structure that surrounds the audience, while Bill Morrison's film of black and white 'found' footage in various states of deterioration is projected onto scrim draping the structure. The ensuing Bill Morrison film, Decasia, cut to Michael Gordon's complete score, was shown at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival and has been screened at film festivals worldwide. Other large-scale symphonic works include Rewriting Beethoven's Seventh Symphony, a radical reworking of the original, commissioned by the 2006 Beethoven Festival in Bonn and premiered by Jonathan Nott and the Bamberg Symphony, and Sunshine of your Love, written for over 100 instruments divided into four microtonally tuned groups. Under the baton of composer/conductor John Adams, the Ensemble Modern toured Sunshine of your Love to seven European capitals in 1999. In 2008 Gordon again collaborated with Ridge Theater on the multi-performer song-cycle lightning at our feet, co-commissioned by Cynthia Woods Mitchell Center for the Arts at the University of Houston and the Brooklyn Academy of Music for the Next Wave Festival. lightning at our feet puts Emily Dickinson's poetry to music and encompasses her words in a world of visual imagery. A further collaboration with Ridge Theater, Gotham, a commission from the American Composers Orchestra, incorporates film, projections, lighting and an orchestra of 35 musicians to explore the 'other' New York City. Directed by Bob McGrath, the work premiered at Carnegie's Zankel Hall in February 2004 with the American Composers Orchestra and combines Bill Morrison's archival and original footage of New York with Laurie Olinder's photographic projections of the urban landscape. Gordon and Morrison's works together also include Dystopia (about Los Angeles), written in 2008 for David Robertson and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and El Sol Caliente about Miami Beach, commissioned by the New World Symphony for the 100th anniversary of the city. The two also collaborated on a piano concerto for Tomoko Mukayaima and the Seattle Symphony in 2016 called The Unchanging Sea. Gordon has worked extensively with London's Icebreaker. His work Yo Shakespeare was recorded by Icebreaker on their debut Argo/Decca recording Terminal Velocity, recently re-released by Cantaloupe Music. Gordon's work Trance was written for Icebreaker with the additional component of eight brass players. The 52-minute work was also originally recorded for Argo and was released in the autumn of 1996; a new re-mixed version is now on Cantaloupe Music. Link was written for the group in 1998, in collaboration with David Lang, as a complementary piece to Yo Shakespeare and Lang's Cheating, Lying, Stealing for a new ballet by Ashley Page for The Royal Ballet in London, subsequently revived by Page at the Scottish Ballet. In 2004 Gordon released Light Is Calling (Nonesuch), an album of tracks created with producers R. Luke DuBois and Damian LeGassick, and scored for a small ensemble of musicians (most notably Todd Reynolds on violin) with complex electronic arrangements orchestrated by DuBois and LeGassick. He has since collaborated with DuBois extensively on the electronic backing arrangements for subsequent pieces, including All Vows for cellist Maya Beiser (2006, for which DuBois also served as a video artist), Sad Park for the Kronos Quartet (2006), and the opera What to Wear, libretto by Richard Foreman (2006). The Sad Park uses the voices of child witnesses to September 11 as its subject. Gordon‚Äôs Natural History, inspired by Crater Lake National Park in Oregon and commissioned by the Britt Festival, was performed in July 2016 on the rim of the lake itself, as part of the 100th anniversary of America‚Äôs National Park Service. The premiere was performed by forty members of the Britt Orchestra, a chorus of fifty regional choristers, fifteen members of Steiger Butte Drum, whose members are all from the local Klamath Tribes, and thirty brass and percussionists from Southern Oregon University. Gordon had three world premieres in the spring of 2016: The Unchanging Sea, a piano concerto for Tomoko Mukayaima and the Seattle Symphony, with video by Bill Morrison; Material, for four-person percussion and piano ensemble Yarn/Wire, playing one piano, and Observations on Air, a bassoon concerto for Peter Whelan and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. In 2017 The Crossing premiered Anonymous Man, a choral memoir, based on conversations that Gordon has had with a homeless man living on his street. Big Space, to be premiered at the 2017 BBC Proms, distributes the musicians throughout the audience. Awards and recognition The recipient of multiple awards and grants, Gordon has been honored by the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, a 2002 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Formed in 1983 as the \\"Michael Gordon Philharmonic\\" and renamed the \\"Michael Gordon Band\\" in 2000, Gordon's own ensemble has performed across Europe and the United States at venues as diverse as Alice Tully Hall and the punk mecca CBGB, on the Contemporary Music Network Tour, and at the Almeida Festival in London. In September 2016 Gordon was named the first-ever composer-in-residence of the Young People's Chorus of New York City.  List of works  *Thou Shalt!/Thou Shalt Not!

Known as Orayvi by the native inhabitants, it is located on Third Mesa on the Hopi Reservation near Kykotsmovi Village. There are no accurate census counts or estimates for the village population. History Oraibi was founded sometime before the year 1100 AD, making it possibly the oldest continuously inhabited settlement within the United States.Casey, Robert L. Journey to the High Southwest. Guilford, CT: Globe Pequot Press, 2007: 382. . Archeologists speculate that a series of severe droughts in the late 13th century forced the Hopi to abandon several smaller villages in the region and consolidate within a few population centers. As Oraibi was one of these surviving settlements its population grew considerably, and became populous and the most influential of the Hopi settlements. By 1890 the village was estimated to have a population of 905, almost half of the 1,824 estimated to be living in all of the Hopi settlements at the time. Oraibi remained unknown to European explorers until about 1540 when Spanish explorer Pedro de Tovar (who was part of the Coronado expedition) encountered the Hopi while searching for the legendary Seven Cities of Gold. Contact with the Europeans remained scant until 1629 when the San Francisco mission was established in the village. In 1680 the Pueblo Revolt resulted in decreased Spanish influence in the area and the cessation of the mission. Subsequent attempts to reestablish the missions in Hopi villages were met with repeated failures. The former mission is still visible today as a ruin. =Split= Hopi interaction with outsiders slowly increased during the 1850-1860 time period through missionaries, traders and surveyors for the US government. Contact remained sporadic and informal until 1870 when an Indian agent was appointed to the Hopi, followed by the establishment of the Hopi Indian Agency in Keams Canyon in 1874. Interaction with the US government increased with the establishment of the Hopi reservation in 1882. This led to a number of changes for the Hopi way of life. Missionary efforts intensified and Hopi children were kidnapped from their homes and forced to attend school, exposing them to new cultural influences. In 1890 a number of residents more receptive to the cultural influences moved closer to the trading post to establish Kykotsmovi Village, sometimes called New Oraibi. The continuing tension caused by the ideological schism between the \\"friendlies\\" (\\"New Hopi\\" to the traditional Hopi), those who were open to these cultural influences, and the \\"hostiles\\" (or \\"Traditionalists\\" led by Yukiuma) who opposed them (those who desired to preserve Hopi ways) led to an event called the Oraibi Split in 1906. Tribal leaders on differing sides of the schism engaged in a bloodless competition to determine the outcome, which resulted in the expulsion of the hostiles (Traditionalists), who left to found the village of Hotevilla. Subsequent efforts by the displaced residents to reintegrate resulted in an additional split, with the second group founding Bacavi. With the loss of much of its population Oraibi lost its place as the center of Hopi culture. Although the Hopi tribal constitution, maneuvered into being by the Coal Mining Interests in 1939, provides each village with a seat on the tribal council, Hotevilla, where most of the traditional Hopi settled, has declined to elect a representative and maintains independence from the tribal council. Kykotsmovi Village is now the seat of the Hopi tribal government. Today In spite of the \\"friendly\\" (\\"New Hopi\\") outcome of the Oraibi Split, Old Oraibi has since maintained a more traditional Hopi way of life and has resisted the adoption of the more modern culture visible in Kykotsmovi. While visitors to the pueblo are welcomed (a short road connects to Arizona State Route 264), the residents tend to be very private and do not allow photographs to be taken in the town. There are thus few ground-level photographs of the settlement as it exists in the modern day. (Public satellite imagery is, however, readily available.) Very old abandoned house and panoramic view on the outskirts of Oraibi village Old Oraibi is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. Cultural references Oraibi features prominently in a famous writing by Aby Warburg, \\"Das Schlangenritual. Ein Reisebericht.\\", which is the transcript of a lecture given in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland in 1923 (English translation \\"Images from the Region of the Pueblo Indians of North America\\"; also translated into many other languages). Warburg visited Oraibi in 1896 and with the help of Henry Voth attended a ritual spring dance. He found in the symbolism of the Hopi (in particular the snake symbol) a key to understanding similar symbols in other cultures. Warburg took several pictures of Oraibi and of the Hopi ceremonies. Hopi life in Oraibi is also described in Don C. Talayesva's autobiography, Sun chief, the autobiography of a Hopi Indian. Talayesva was born in Oraibi in 1890, where he was raised as a traditional Hopi. Talayesva started working in 1938 with a Yale University anthropologist, Leo Simmons, who helped him write his autobiography. Hopi educator, writer, and potter Polingaysi Q√∂yawayma (1892‚Äì1990) related stories of growing up in Oraibi in her 1964 autobiography No Turning Back.

It was opened to the public in 1988 and is the largest privately owned military museum in the United Kingdom. History ATS women operate a rangefinder at the anti- aircraft training camp at Weybourne, 23 October 1941. A mobile 3.7-inch AA gun can be seen in the background. The museum is located on the site of the Second World War and post-war Weybourne Anti Aircraft Training Camp. Weybourne Camp is north west of the coastal village of Weybourne. The site, originally called Carvel Farm, was first used in 1935 by the Anti‚ÄìAircraft Division of the Territorial Army as a summer training camp. In 1937 and as a result of the growing threat of war, it was decided to make the camp permanent and more fixed structures and defences were erected. During the Second World War, the camp was surrounded by a perimeter anti-tank ditch and defended by a system of gun emplacements and barbed wire. The interior of the camp consisted of groups of Nissen huts, barracks and other military buildings. The cliff top to the north was covered by a line of heavy anti-aircraft guns and batteries, slit trenches and pillboxes. In 1941, the camp was visited by Winston Churchill, to view a demonstration of the Unrotated Projectile anti‚Äìaircraft weapon. As the war progressed, defences at Weybourne Camp became more complex and were altered regularly and significantly and a grass airstrip was laid out, which remains in use. After the war, the camp became known as the AA permanent Range and Radar Training Wing and gunnery training continued until 1958. The site still has a RAF radar receiving station and is the location of the University of East Anglia Weybourne Atmospheric Observatory and a Metrological Station. The museum When Weybourne Camp closed, the site returned to private ownership and many buildings that were beyond repair were demolished. The Muckleburgh Collection was founded by Squadron Leader Berry Savory and his son Michael Savory. At the time of the museum's opening in 1988, the principal display consisted of 30 vehicles and a small room describing the camp history. The museum has expanded to include over 150 artillery pieces, tanks and other vehicles, most of which are in working order. The Muckleburgh Collection is home to The Suffolk and Norfolk Yeomanry collection,Suffolk Yeomanry#World War II the North Norfolk Amateur Radio GroupNorth Norfolk Amateur Radio Group and numerous special displays. The vehicles, museum site, and its unspoilt has been used for television films, documentaries and dramas.Muckleburgh Collection on TV The museum offers rides in a military vehicle and hosts \\"tank driving\\" in a FV432.

The summit was the location of a private halt from 1900 to around 1926.Butt (1995), page 30 Steam locomotives frequently required banking assistance in getting their heavy trains up the incline, particularly in the northbound direction, which had steeper gradients. There was an engine shed at Beattock which had banking locomotives on standby twenty-four hours per day to minimise train delays. The severity of the climb to the summit is referenced in W. H.

In all these contexts, it means \\"trying to make that which belongs to the afterlife happen here and now (on Earth).\\" Theologically the belief is akin to postmillennialism as reflected in the Social Gospel of the 1880‚Äì1930 era, as well as Protestant reform movements during the Second Great Awakening in the 1830s and 1840s such as abolitionism. Origin Modern usage of the phrase started with Eric Voegelin in The New Science of Politics in 1952. Conservative spokesman William F. Buckley popularized Voegelin's phrase as \\"Don't immanentize the eschaton!\\" Buckley's version became a political slogan of Young Americans for Freedom during the 1960s and 1970s. Voegelin identified a number of similarities between ancient Gnosticism and the beliefs held by a number of modern political theories, particularly Communism and Nazism. He identified the root of the Gnostic impulse as belief in a lack of concord within society as a result of an inherent disorder, or even evil, of the world. He described this as having two effects: *The belief that the disorder of the world can be transcended by extraordinary insight, learning, or knowledge, called a Gnostic Speculation by Voegelin (the Gnostics themselves referred to this as gnosis). *The desire to implement a policy to actualize the speculation, or as Voegelin said, to Immanentize the Eschaton, to create a sort of heaven on earth within history. See Scientism. One of the more oft-quoted passages from Voegelin's work on Gnosticism is that \\"The problem of an eidos in history, hence, arises only when a Christian transcendental fulfillment becomes immanentized. Such an immanentist hypostasis of the eschaton, however, is a theoretical fallacy.\\"Eric Voegelin, The New Science of Politics, 1952, in: The Collected Works of Eric Voegelin, Volume 5, Modernity Without Restraint, edited and introduced by Manfred Henningsen, University of Missouri Press, Columbia, Missouri, 1999, page 185. . The book Fire in the Minds of Men explores the idea further.Fire in the Minds of Men, introduction Christianity The Lutheran Confessions directly reject the idea of an immanentized eschaton, condemning the belief \\"that before the resurrection of the dead the godly shall take possession of the kingdom of the world, the ungodly being everywhere suppressed.\\" The Catechism of the Catholic Church makes an oblique reference to the desire to \\"Immanentize the Eschaton\\" in article 676: > The Antichrist's deception already begins to take shape in the world every > time the claim is made to realize within history that messianic hope which > can only be realized beyond history through the eschatological judgment. The > Church has rejected even modified forms of this falsification of the kingdom > to come under the name of millenarianism, especially the \\"intrinsically > perverse\\" political form of a secular messianism. At the end of the 12th century, Joachim of Fiore theorized the coming of an age of earthly bliss right before the end of time. Although not a full immanentization, Joachim has opened the way to an anticipation of the eschaton in the course of time. His ideas have influenced the thoughts on an immanentized eschaton. Political interpretations In contemporary terminology this process is sometimes described as \\"hastening the eschaton\\" or \\"hastening the apocalypse.‚Äù In this sense it refers to a phenomenon related to millenarianism and the specific Christian form millennialism which is based on a particular reading of the Christian Bible's Book of Revelation especially popular among evangelicals in the United States. Some conservative critics sometimes use these terms as a pejorative reference to certain projects such as Nazism, socialism, and communism. In popular culture The phrase is cited in the Discordian text Principia Discordia, first published in 1965, and appears fifteen times in Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea's 1975 The Illuminatus! Trilogy, the first line of which reads: \\"It was the year when they finally immanentized the Eschaton.\\" In Ken Macleod's 1997 science fiction novel The Stone Canal, one of the chapters is called, \\"Another crack at Immanentising the Eschaton.\\" The phrase is also used in issue four of Warren Ellis' 2007 comic, Doktor Sleepless. It appears to be the goal of the title character to bring about the end of the world, driven by disappointment over how the future of the past has transpired. Sleepless wants to end the world to keep it from getting worse. The phrase is quoted several times, and can be regarded as the driving force behind the comic. Frederik Pohl wrote a trilogy of books from 1997 to 1999 known as The Eschaton Sequence. In these books, the human race is caught up in a galactic war fought between two alien races attempting to immanentize the eschaton. The books are titled The Other End of Time, The Siege of Eternity and The Far Shore of Time. It is quoted (on a banner) in Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle's 2009 novel Escape from Hell. It was used in the lyrics of the two rave singles \\"All You Need Is Love\\" by The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu in 1987, and the Shamen's \\"Destination Eschaton\\" in 1995.

As of 31 March 2013, 1.4% (12,514) of Scotland's children were subject to a supervision requirement (now known as a compulsory supervision order). A children's hearing is carried out by three specially trained lay tribunal members of the children's panel, a children's reporter, child and legal guardian and a representative of the local social work department. The children's reporter takes no part in the decision making process of a children's hearing. A change to the role was introduced in September 2009 and the reporter is able to make representations if the panel is at risk of making a decision which is not, in the reporter's view, competent or procedurally correct. The reporter is responsible for the administration of the Hearing and also represents the decisions of hearings in a court setting when grounds of referral (now known as the statement of grounds) are disputed or the child or relevant person is unable to understand and comment on the statement of grounds (for example, due to the child's age). As of 24 June 2013, Children's Hearings Scotland took over the running of thirty two local authority panels to have one national children's panel for Scotland with approximately 2,700 volunteers supported by 22 area support teams. Procedure =Selecting cases for hearings= Children referred to hearings are first referred to the Scottish Children's Reporter Administration. Uniquely in Scotland, referrals may be made on offence grounds and/or care and protection grounds. The children's reporter investigates the case (usually via information provided by the social work department) and will decide whether or not compulsory measures of supervision may be required. If, in the reporter's opinion, such measures are required, a Hearing will be arranged. The Reporter may take other steps short of arranging a hearing, for example arrange for some form of restorative justice. In 2012‚Äì13, 4,472 of the 22,348 referrals received (20%) were referred to a hearing as new grounds and 36.39% of referrals did not require compulsory measures of supervision. Any child generally under the age of 16, or under the age of 18 but still subject to a compulsory supervision order (CSO), who offends is referred to a hearing unless the area procurator fiscal decides that the seriousness of the case merits prosecution in either a sheriff court or the High Court of Justiciary. =People involved with hearings= Duty to attend * Panel Members Right and Duty to attend This group of people, unless excused by the panel, must attend every hearing to contribute to the proceedings of the hearing. * Child * Relevant Person (Relevant person is a person who is either the birth parent, unless these rights and responsibilities have been removed by a court; an individual with parental rights and responsibilities that has been appointed by a court order; or, an individual who has been deemed by a Children's Hearing where they have (or has recently had) a significant involvement in the upbringing of the child) Right to attend * Child Representative * Relevant Person Representative * Principal Reporter (or as delegated to a Children's Reporter, Trainee Reporter or Assistant Reporter) * Safeguarder * Member of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council or the Scottish Committee of that Council (acting in that person's capacity as such) * Member of an Area Support Team (acting in that person's capacity as such) * Representative of a newspaper or news agency * Escort supporting Child / Relevant Person (for example a constable, prison officer, or other person) Other persons Finally are the group of people where attendance is not compulsory, however would assist the proceedings by giving information to the panel and aid discussion. The chairing person, however, has a responsibility to keep attendees down to a minimum. Other persons may include: * Social workers * Teachers * Health Visitors Some people maybe excluded from the hearing if it would be in the benefit of the child/young person. If relevant persons, their representatives and/or (if necessary) the press are excluded, the \\"substance\\" of the discussion which took place needs to be discussed on their return. =Hearings= For the hearing itself, a child may automatically be entitled to legal assistance when specific circumstances apply. These are when: * an application is made to the Sheriff for variation or recall of a child protection order * a children‚Äôs hearing is to be held on the second working day after a child protection order has been granted * a children‚Äôs hearing, or pre-hearing panel, considers that it may be necessary to make a compulsory supervision order including a secure accommodation authorisation * a hearing is arranged after the child is detained in custody by the police. In other circumstances, the child and/or relevant persons can apply for legal assistance via the Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB). Children‚Äôs Legal Representatives are members of special panels maintained by SLAB, with all costs met by the Scottish Government. The hearing may also appoint an independent person known as a Safeguarder whose purpose is to prepare a report to assist the hearing in reaching a decision; the Safeguarder must act in the best interests of the child, which indeed is the basis of all decisions made by children's hearings. Each Children's Hearing must consider whether the child's immediate safety is assured. If this is not the case panel members have the power to issue an Interim Compulsory Supervision Order (when the child does not already subject to a Compulsory Supervision Order) or Interim Variation of a Compulsory Supervision Order (when the child already has a Compulsory Supervision Order but there is not enough information to make a substantive decision). This interim measure empowers the social work department to the move the child to \\"a place of safety\\" (e.g. Children's Residential Home, Foster Care, the care of relatives). Panel members also have the powers to issue a warrant when necessary to enforce the attendance of a child who has failed to attend his/her hearing. Section 67 Grounds For a child to be required to attend a Children's Hearing, one or more Section 67 Ground must be relevant to the child. They include various care and offence related grounds. The grounds are that: *(a): the child is likely to suffer unnecessarily, or the health or development of the child is likely to be seriously impaired, due to a lack of parental care *(b): a schedule 1 offence has been committed in respect of the child *(c): the child has, or is likely to have, a close connection with a person who has committed a schedule 1 offence *(d): the child is, or is likely to become, a member of the same household as a child in respect of whom a schedule 1 offence has been committed *(e): the child is being, or is likely to be, exposed to persons whose conduct is (or has been) such that it is likely that **(i) the child will be abused or harmed, or **(ii) the child‚Äôs health, safety or development will be seriously adversely affected *(f): the child has, or is likely to have, a close connection with a person who has carried out domestic abuse, *(g): the child has, or is likely to have, a close connection with a person who has committed an offence under Part 1, 4 or 5 of the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 (asp 9) *(h): the child is being provided with accommodation by a local authority under section 25 of the 1995 Act and special measures are needed to support the child *(i): a permanence order is in force in respect of the child and special measures are needed to support the child *(j): the child has committed an offence *(k): the child has misused alcohol *(l): the child has misused a drug (whether or not a controlled drug) *(m): the child‚Äôs conduct has had, or is likely to have, a serious adverse effect on the health, safety or development of the child or another person *(n): the child is beyond the control of a relevant person *(o): the child has failed without reasonable excuse to attend regularly at school *(p): the child **(i) is being, or is likely to be, subjected to physical, emotional or other pressure to enter into a marriage or civil partnership, or **(ii) is, or is likely to become, a member of the same household as such a child. * (q): the child **(i) has been, is being or is likely to be forced into a marriage (that expression being construed in accordance with section 1 of the Forced Marriage etc. (Protection and Jurisdiction) (Scotland) Act 2011 (asp 15)) or, **(ii) is, or is likely to become, a member of the same household as such a child. Decisions Following a grounds hearing, the panel may decide that compulsory measures of supervision are not required and discharge the referral. However, if required, hearings have power to make a number of orders ‚Äì these are: * Compulsory supervision order (CSO) * Interim compulsory supervision order (ICSO) * Medical examination order * Warrant to Secure Attendance. When making either a CSO or ICSO, the hearing could attach a number of measures which may range from attendance on a particular programme, conditions regulating contact with parents or other significant adults/family members, contact with a social worker, placement in foster care, residential accommodation or secure accommodation. Once issued a CSO must be reviewed by a Hearing within 12 months. Relevant persons (as described above) and children can ask for this to be reviewed at any stage after 3 months. The social work department have powers to ask for the order to be reviewed though at any time. History The children‚Äôs hearings system was initiated by the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, and further reinforced by Children (Scotland) Act 1995 and Children's Hearings (Scotland) Act 2011. It followed a report in April 1964 of a committee set up by the Secretary of State for Scotland under the chairmanship of Lord Kilbrandon, a Senator of the College of Justice, to examine how young offenders were dealt with. The existing juvenile courts were regarded as unsuitable because they had to combine the characteristics of a criminal court with those of a treatment agency. Separation of functions was recommended. The establishment of the grounds of referral (where disputed) was to remain with the courts but decisions on treatment were to be the responsibility of a new and unique kind of tribunal, which would be neither a court of law nor a local authority committee. On 15 April 1971, hearings took over from the courts most of the responsibility for children under 16. The Children's Hearings (Scotland) Act 2011 came into force on 24 June 2013 and brought a number of changes including updated grounds, updated legal orders, pre-hearing panels and the use of interim measures (instead of warrants).

An early version was published in The Dancing Master, 9th edition (1695). The Virginia Reel is probably related to it. The name refers to a fox, and the dance's steps are reminiscent of a hunted fox going in and out of cover.  References in modern culture  It is mentioned in Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol (1843) when the Ghost of Christmas Past shows Scrooge a party from his apprenticeship with Mr. Fezziwig. \\"...the great effect of the evening came after the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler ... struck up 'Sir Roger de Coverley'. Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig.\\" In the 1951 film Scrooge, based on Dickens's story and starring Alastair Sim in the title role, the fiddler is shown playing the tune at an energetic tempo during the party scene. It also figures in William Makepeace Thackeray's short story \\"The Bedford-Row Conspiracy\\" as the musical center piece of a political feast pitting the Whigs against the Torys and in Arnold Bennett's novel \\"Leonora\\" as music considered more suitable for a ball by the older gents to the likes of the Blue Danube Waltz. It is mentioned also in the book Silas Marner by George Eliot, when the fiddler at the Cass New Year's Eve party plays it to signal the beginning of the evening dancing; it is furthermore mentioned in the children's book The Rescuers by Margery Sharp. Also Harry Thompson, in his first novel This Thing of Darkness, mentioned this dance. \\"... and so it was that, five minutes later, he found himself bowing to her, and she curtsying in reply, as they lined up facing one another for the commencement of the Sir Roger de Coverley\\". The dance plays a part in the Dorothy Sayers short story \\"The Queen's Square\\", and is mentioned in Washington Irving's The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.. Sir Roger de Coverly also gets a mention in \\"Stig of the Dump\\" by Clive King when Barney and his sister attend a fancy dress party. It is also mentioned in D H Lawrence's Sons and Lovers (1913), where Gertrude Morel is reported never to have learned the dance. The dance is also mentioned in Anthony Trollope's novel Can You Forgive Her? Vol. 2 Ch. IX The tune was used by Frank Bridge in 1922 as the basis of a work for strings titled Sir Roger de Coverly (A Christmas Dance). H. E. Bates used the name Sir Roger to refer to a real hunted fox in the novel Love for Lydia. Sir Roger de Coverley was also the name of a character in The Spectator (1711), created by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele. An English squire of Queen Anne's reign, Sir Roger exemplified the values of an old country gentleman, and was portrayed as lovable but somewhat ridiculous ('rather beloved than esteemed') (Spectator no. 2), making his Tory politics seem harmless but silly. He was said to be the grandson of the man who invented the dance. Joseph Heller included a character, \\"Major ‚Äî‚Äî de Coverley\\" (a possible reference to \\"...Coverly\\") in his novel, Catch 22. Thomas Pynchon, in his 1973 novel, Gravity's Rainbow, includes a character, DeCoverly Pox. The name is a likely play on \\"DeCoverley\\" and Roger the fox of the eponymous dance..

His family castle was the Isenburg near Hattingen, Germany. Murder According to recent research, Frederick of Isenberg was a leading figure in the opposition of Westphalian nobles to the aggressive power politics of the Archbishop of Cologne, Engelbert of Berg. In 1225 at the Nobles' Assembly in Soest, Count Frederick met his cousin Count Engelbert von Berg, Archbishop of Cologne, in order to bring about a peaceful agreement concerning the stewardship (Vogtei) of Essen Abbey, which Count Frederick, according to contemporary complaints, was abusing to his own benefit and to the detriment of the abbey. No conclusion was reached. During their return together from Soest to Cologne, Count Frederick arranged to ambush his cousin, in a defile at the foot of the Gevelsberg between Hagen and Schwelm in the late afternoon of 7 November 1225, in the course of which the Archbishop was killed. There is no consensus as to whether it was a deliberately planned murder, or whether the Archbishop was killed in the heat of combat. Current research assumes the latter, and that it was intended to take him into \\"knightly detention\\" so that the political demands of the opposing nobility could be pushed through. This was in accordance with the customs of the medieval feuding ethos. Aftermath Frederick of Isenberg was outlawed and excommunicated. He was stripped of all offices and stewardships and his entire personal wealth. In the winter of 1225/1226 the new Archbishop of Cologne, Heinrich von M√ºllenark, besieged and destroyed his castle. Frederick travelled with his brothers Dietrich and Engelbert, bishops of M√ºnster and Osnabr√ºck (both also implicated in the death of the Archbishop), and the notary of Isenberg with the necessary documents to the Curia in Rome, in order to have the excommunication lifted. On the return journey Frederick was taken prisoner at Li√®ge and sold for 2,100 silver marks to the chapter of Cologne Cathedral. On 14 November 1226 he was executed in front of the Severin Gate in Cologne. His arms and legs were smashed and he was broken on the wheel, after which he was displayed on a stone pillar. He did not die until the next day. His son, Count Dietrich von Altena-Isenberg, later fought to recover his paternal inheritance and founded the house of the Counts of Limburg and the County of Limburg at Hohenlimburg. Marriage and children Frederick married c. 1210 Sophie of Limburg, a daughter of Waleran III, Duke of Limburg and Cunigunde of Lorraine. They had issue: * Dietrich I (born before 1215, died 1301), last Count of Isenberg and Altena, 1st Count of Limburg (a.d.Lenne) * Friedrich of Altena (born before 1220, died after 1243) * Elisabeth of Altena (born before 1220, died after 1275), married ca. 1234 Dietrich II Count of Mors (born 1226, died 1275) * Sophie of Altena (born before 1222, died after 1292), married in 1237 Heinrich III von Volmestein * Agnes of Altena (born before 1228, died after 1282), married in 1243 Burchard III von Broich.

The game is based on Richard Wagner's four opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen, and features music from various performances of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Georg Solti from 1958 to 1964, chosen in collaboration with PolyGram and Decca. French comic-book artist Philippe Druillet also worked on the game, providing much of the artwork. The game makes a significant departure from the source material by binding the stories behind the four parts of the cycle with a surrealist science fiction background; the main plot involves a being by the name of ISH, who is guided by the voice of Erda (played by Charlotte Rampling), and who discovers the story of the Nibelungen. Ring received largely negative reviews in North America, but was a commercial hit, with sales above 400,000 units worldwide by October 2002. Gameplay The central hub in Ring. Gameplay is similar to Cryo's previous game, Atlantis: The Lost Tales. The game is played primarily from a first-person perspective which is controlled by the mouse. To speak to people or interact with objects, the player must click on them with the pointer. The pointer also controls the direction of movement. However, when ISH moves from one location to another, the game briefly switches to a pre- rendered third-person view. The game itself is, as per the source story, divided into four levels which can be played in any order. An asteroid serves as a \\"hub\\" to the game, allowing level selection, and is also the location of the introduction sequence which presents all of the major protagonists. The game also ends on the asteroid. Story Set in the 40th century, the game begins with the introduction of ISH, one of the last surviving humans. Humanity has been enslaved by an alien race that destroyed Earth millennia ago, and took away all creativity and creative expression, meaning humanity slowly lost all sense of its cultural history. However, ISH is given the chance to save humanity by the aliens. They present to him the story of the Nibelungen, and have him embody each of the four main characters in the hopes that his experiences will lead him to lust for power, which is what led to the downfall of humanity in the first place. However, the goddess Erda believes she can help ISH by guiding him towards rejecting the desire for power. The four characters are Alberich (a cruel and sadistic dwarf king), Loge (a fire spirit), Siegmund (the son of the god Wotan), and Br√ºnnhilde (a Valkyrie warrior). The story begins with Alberich arriving back in his kingdom to discover that he has very little left, nothing in the kingdom works, and his workers have formed a union and gone on strike. In order to break up the strike, Alberich must find something to satisfy the disgruntled workers, and with this aim in mind, he sets off to procure the gold of the Rhinemaidens. The second part has the player in control of Loge. His story intertwines somewhat with that of Alberich's - in the employ of the gods, he is charged by Wotan with retrieving the Nibelungen ring and the magic crown of Wotan from Alberich. The third section tells the story of Siegmund, son of Wotan, as he attempts to unravel the circumstances surrounding the death of his mother and sister. The fourth section tells the story of Br√ºnnhilde, Siegmund's half- sister, who saves him at the end of the third chapter. Her act enrages Wotan, and she is forced to flee to Valhalla where she can obtain a magic artifact to bring back to the asteroid on which the story begins - thus completing the titular \\"ring\\". Development Ring was the second game developed by Arxel Tribe, following its 1997 title Pilgrim: Faith as a Weapon. References and differences to the original opera The four individual chapters of the game refer to the first two parts of the opera cycle, Rheingold and Die Walk√ºre, and the story is, for the most part, recognisable from its source material. However, there are several significant differences. The most obvious alteration is the inclusion of a science fiction backstory that precedes and concludes the game. Another change is that in the opera, Siegmund is killed while fighting his sister's lover Hunding, whereas in the game he is saved by Br√ºnnhilde. In the opera, Wotan confronts Br√ºnhilde for saving Siegmund and confines her to eternal sleep, while in the game, she brings a magic artifact to the asteroid.  Reception  =Sales= Ring was a commercial hit. Lib√©ration reported its sales as 150,000 units by May 1999, following its launch in October 1998. According to Guillaume de Fondaumi√®re of Arxel Tribe, it continued to sell for two years after release, which brought it to 270,000 units sold by March 2001. By October 2002, its sales had reached 400,000 units. Philippe Druillet placed Rings lifetime sales in France near 200,000 units by 2006, and its overall sales above 450,000 units by 2007, at which time it had been released in 47 countries. Conversely, de Fondaumi√®re reported in 2009 that it had sold more than 600,000 copies worldwide. =Critical reviews= The game received mainly negative reviews. It holds an aggregate score of 40.38% on GameRankings, based on twelve reviews. Ray Ivey of Adventure Gamers wrote that it \\"received some of the worst reviews of any game in the late 90s.\\" However, The Electric Playground named it one of the best adventure games of 1999. Reviews in Slovenia were more positive.https://archive.today/20190227021908/https://www.dnevnik.si/1042719436 GameSpot's Ron Dulin scored the game 3.7 out of 10. While he was impressed with the graphics engine, he criticised the art design as \\"bland and colorless.\\" He was especially critical of the puzzles, which he felt suffered from a lack of logic. He concluded that \\"There are many problems with Ring, but the greatest one is that it is so utterly uninviting. A cold world filled with uninteresting, incoherent characters, bad voice acting, puzzles involving little or no logic, and an almost absolute lack of direction all add up to create a world that is unpleasant for all but its musical accompaniment.\\" Daniel Erickson reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it one star out of five, and stated that \\"Even if you're a fan of adventure games, opera, and Wagner's Ring Cycle, you'll still hate Ring.\\" IGN's Tal Blevins scored the game 2.7 out of 10 calling it \\"abysmal at best.\\" He was highly critical of the science-fiction aspect of the story, and argued that anyone not familiar with the opera would be completely lost for the majority of the game. As with GameSpot, he was critical of the puzzles, which he called \\"utterly ridiculous.\\" He praised the music and sound but was critical of the graphics, and called the game \\"a complete travesty\\" and \\"a 10 hour CGI movie with a horribly confusing plot.\\" Game Revolution's Johnny Liu gave the game an F. He too was highly critical of the puzzles and the trial- and-error nature of the gameplay. He argued that playing the game could be summarised as \\"you watch a sequence. Then you turn around, a lot, looking for \\"hot spots,\\" and then watch another sequence. It's about as involving as channel surfing.\\" He called the graphics \\"pixelated crap,\\" although he praised the art design, and concluded that \\"Poor Richard Wagner is probably rolling in his grave. Even if it had the graphics, without strong gameplay and logical puzzles, Ring snaps under its own weighted ambitions.\\" Adventure Gamers' Rey Ivey was more impressed, scoring it 3.5 out of 5. He felt that the plot of the game made little sense and was critical of the dialogue, but, unlike almost all other reviews, he praised the graphics and the puzzles, saying \\"the graphics are a knock-out,\\" and lauding the unusual nature of the puzzles. Sequel Cover art In 2003, Ring was followed by a sequel, Ring II: Twilight of the Gods, which brings the cycle to an end, following the two last parts of Wagner's Ring des Nibelungen, Siegfried and G√∂tterd√§mmerung. Ring II was met with extremely negative reviews and considered a failure.

This is because several revisions in classifying the great apes have caused the use of the term \\"hominid\\" to vary over time. Its original meaning referred only to humans (Homo) and their closest relatives. That restrictive usage has been largely assumed by the term \\"hominin\\", which comprises all members of the human clade after the split from the chimpanzees (Pan). The modern meaning of the term \\"hominid\\" refers to all the great apes, including humans. Usage still varies, however, and some scientists and laypersons still use the term in the original restrictive sense; the scholarly literature generally will show the traditional usage until around the end of the 20th century. For further information, see Hominini (at \\"hominins\\") and Hominidae (at discussion of the terms \\"hominid\\" and \\"hominin\\" in the lede section).

The remains from Kamoya's Hominid Site (KHS) were called Omo I and those from Paul I. Abell's Hominid Site (PHS) Omo II. Fossils The bones include two partial skulls, four jaws, a legbone, around two hundred teeth and several other parts. The specimens, Omo I and Omo II, are both classified as anatomically modern humans (or Homo sapiens) but differ from each other in morphological traits. The Omo I fossils indicate more modern traits, while Studies of the postcranial remains of Omo II indicate an overall modern human morphology with some primitive features. The fossils were found in a layer of tuff, between a lower, older geologic layer named Member I and a higher, newer layer dubbed Member III. The Omo I and Omo II hominin fossils were taken from similar stratigraphic levels over Member I.Ian McDougall, Francis H Brown, John G Fleagle Sapropels and the age of hominins Omo I and II, Kibish, Ethiopia. Journal of Human Evolution (2008) Volume: 55, Issue: 3, Pages: 409-20 PubMed: 18602675 Copyright ¬© 2012 Mendeley Ltd. All rights reserved. [Retrieved 2012-01-02] Because of the very limited fauna and the few stone artifacts that were found at the sites when the original Omo remains were discovered, the provenance and estimated age of the Kibish hominids are uncertain. In 2008, new bone remains were discovered from Awoke's Hominid Site (AHS). The AHS fossil's tibia and fibula were unearthed from Member I, the same layer from which the other Omo remains derive. Dating and implications About 30 years after the original finds, a detailed stratigraphic analysis of the area surrounding the fossils was done. The Member I layer was argon-dated to 195,000 years ago, and the (higher layer) Member III was dated to 105,000 years ago. Numerous recent lithic records verify the tool technology from Members I and III to the Middle Stone Age. The lower layer, Member I, (below the fossils) is considerably older than the 160,000-year-old Herto remains designated as Homo sapiens idaltu. The rainy conditions at that time‚Äîwhich are known from isotopic ages on the Kibish Formation corresponding to the ages of Mediterranean sapropels‚Äîsuggest increased flow of the Nile River and, therefore, increased flow of the Omo River. But the climates changed such that after 185,000 years ago conditions were so dry as to not allow speleothems to grow in the caverns in the Levantine land-bridge region, the vital inroad for migration to Eurasia. Parts of the fossils are the earliest to have been classified by Leakey as Homo sapiens. In 2004, the geological layers around the fossils were dated, with the age of the \\"Kibish hominids\\" estimated at [thousand years ago].https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/25/oldest-known-human- fossil-outside-africa-discovered-in-israel For some time, these were the oldest known fossils classified as H. sapiens (the Florisbad Skull is older, but its classification as H. sapiens was then disputed). With the dating of the Jebel Irhoud 1-5 to before 250 ka (315 ¬± 34 ka, and ) in 2017, as well as the classification of the Florisbad Skull as H. sapiens, this is no longer the case.

Caparas and artist Steve Gan. His stories were first serialized in the comic series Ang Panday in Pilipino Komiks during the late 1970s. The character, whose real name is Flavio, became a Philippine pop culture icon since it was adapted to film (Ang Panday) in 1980 with Fernando Poe Jr. portraying Flavio and Max Alvarado as his archenemy Lizardo. The film spawned three direct sequels as well as other more loosely connected films and television series including an animated version. Publication history In the 1970s, Carlo J. Caparas was thinking of a new comics adventure novel due to the wishes of his publisher Don Ramon Roces and then later he came up with a legendary folk hero named Panday. He patterned the character to look like Fernando Poe Jr. as he instructed the artist and co-creator Steve Gan to draw Panday's face similar to Poe's. Upon making the character, Caparas already conceived in his mind that Poe would be Panday even before the character was still yet to be portrayed by Poe in film. The character along with its look, villains and powers also drew inspiration from Philippine history and culture. Their creation first appeared in Pilipino Komiks in 1979 as the comic serial Ang Panday. It sold hundreds of thousands copies every week during its run in the 1980s. The first stories do not contain fantastical elements and Panday is just an ordinary blacksmith named Flavio who fights criminals by using his sledgehammer. He has no superpowers and no supernatural weapons. In the later stories, Panday possesses a dagger that turns magically into a sword which he forged from a mystical meteorite. Caparas got the idea of meteorite from his childhood where he and his playmates would find these kind of rocks and when they break them, sparkling materials that seems magical can be seen inside. In the 1980s, the character was later serialized in Liwayway magazine entitled Dugo ng Panday and then as a comic strip in the People's Journal tabloid entitled Hiwaga ng Panday. In 2005, an Ovaltine sponsored comics series was released about the character. The story of this comics was connected to the 2005 television series Panday aired at ABS-CBN and was still penned by Caparas but was drawn by Rico Rival and colored by Richard Bonzon. Character background A Buster Warenski dagger that bears resemblance to Panday's balaraw The common story line for Panday indicate that Flavio is a noble blacksmith and then one day a meteorite falls from the sky. He forges its ore into a dagger (balaraw in Filipino), which magically turns into a sword when he raises it and points to the sky. He uses this sword to fight evil forces who are oppressing his hometown. Flavio is just a normal human and has no special powers or skills, except for his blacksmithing and swordsmanship. He uses his magical blade that emits energy bolts to fight his supernatural enemies. The blade hums when danger is near and can cut through anything without resistance. He uses a shield on occasion, which is likewise also forged from the meteorite. Flavio wears a distinctive costume, composed of a red vest, dark pants and boots. Besides Flavio's love interest, supporting characters in the series include a boy sidekick and an old hermit-like adviser. For example, in the first film adaptation Ang Panday, there is a boy named Lando (portrayed by Bentot Jr.) that serves as Flavio's buddy and an old man named Tata Temyong (played by Lito Anzures) that serves as Panday's adviser. Panday's initial enemies are ordinary bandits, criminals and even Spanish soldiers and then later he battles supernatural beings including witches, ghosts, flesh-eating beasts and demons. His archnemesis is demon prince Lizardo. In other media Fernando Poe Jr. featured in one of the 2010 postage stamps released in his honor. The other postage stamps feature his Panday character. Outside the comics world, Panday is featured in various media, most notably in film and television as well as theme songs for these medium. The character became more popular due to the portrayal of Fernando Poe Jr. in Ang Panday film series from 1980 to 1984. Poe's Panday also appeared as cameo in other films including She-Man, Msitress of the Universe and Ang Pagbabalik ni Pedro Penduko. In 2010, Panday and other characters portrayed by Poe are featured in commemorative stamps issued by Philippine Postal Office. =Films= The Ang Panday original film series consisted of four films: Ang Panday (\\"The Blacksmith\\", 1980), Pagbabalik ng Panday (\\"The Return of the Blacksmith\\", 1981), Ang Panday: Ikatlong Yugto (\\"The Blacksmith: The Third Act\\", 1982), and Ang Panday IV: Ika-Apat Na Aklat (\\"The Blacksmith IV: The Fourth Book\\", 1984). These films all starred Fernando Poe, Jr. as the title character, Flavio and Max Alvarado as Lizardo. After four films starring Poe, other Panday films were produced continuing or rebooting the story line of the original series. The original Ang Panday 1980 film is considered to be one of the most persisting and frequently rebooted film in the action-fantasy genre in the Philippines. In 1993, Ramon \\"Bong\\" Revilla, Jr. headlined the film Dugo ng Panday (\\"Blood of the Blacksmith\\") as a descendant and namesake of the original Flavio and Edu Manzano as the antagonist. The plot of the film takes place centuries after the first Flavio's death and then his descendant finds the balaraw because of his pure heart, and takes up his mantle as the Panday. Meanwhile, Lizardo's brain has been transplanted to an alien cyborg body (played by Manzano), while his head (still played by Alvarado) is preserved in a tank. Eventually, the new Panday destroys the cyborg and kills the head. Also released in 1993 was Pandoy: Ang Alalay ng Panday (\\"Pandoy, the Blacksmith's Apprentice\\"), a parody of and homage to the original film series, which starred comedy actor Joey de Leon as Pandoy. In the film, Panday is absent and stable boy Pandoy became the new blacksmith and he get rid of the pirates and white slavers lead by villainous Redentor (portrayed by Joel Torre) who is terrorizing his town. The film features a subplot of Pandoy having to choose between two romantic interests. A film in 1998 entitled Hiwaga ng Panday (\\"Mystery of the Blacksmith\\") stars Jinggoy Estrada as Guiller, a gunsmith, and Kris Aquino as Emy, his love interest. The strory stars as Flavio, the original Panday, dies and before his death he was able to plant his magic sword in a wall in a small chapel, and the only one with a clean heart and noble intentions may pull it out. In the present day, Guiller, an expert gunsmith and protector of the poor, meets Emy after both are taken hostage by criminals. Guiller becomes the new Panday after he retrieves the balaraw and fights a kidnap-for-ransom gang. The sword is melted and reforged into a shotgun which fires bullets and stun rays. It magically turns back to a sword when needed. Unlike all other incarnations of the Panday, Guiller wears a black jacket and jeans. In 2009, a reboot of the series, Ang Panday was released by GMA Films as one of the entries of 2009 Metro Manila Film Festival and stars Bong Revilla who also starred in 1993 Dugo ng Panday film as a descendant of the original Flavio but this time he played as Flavio himself. Lizardo is played by Phillip Salvador who also played Flavio in the 2005 Panday television series. Ely Buendia and his Pupil band performed the theme song of the film. In 2011, a sequel, Ang Panday 2, was also shown in theaters as an entry of 2011 Metro Manila Film Festival, with the stars reprising their roles. In 2017, it was announced that another Panday film was in the works with Coco Martin set to direct and star as Flavio after Caparas approved the film. The film marked Martin's directorial debut. The film (entitled also as Ang Panday) was eventually shown during the 2017 Metro Manila Film Festival. The theme song entitled \\"Ang Panday\\" is performed by Gloc-9 and Ebe Dancel. The evil Lizardo is played by Jake Cuenca in this film. As like with the previous Panday iterations, Flavio in this film is a descendant of the original Panday. =Television series= In 1987, RPN aired its first ever Filipino animated television series, Ang Panday based on Poe's character. The animated series, the first television adaptation of the Panday character, was created by Geirry Garccia with Poe reprising his role as the voice of Panday. Garccia was honored for his animated works including the Ang Panday television series. In 2005, ABS-CBN aired a live-action Panday television series. It features a young new Panday named Tristan, played by Jericho Rosales, Heart Evangelista as Eden, his love interest, and Victor Neri as Lizardo. Philip Salvador plays a version of Poe's character who appears in the introductory episodes. In this version Flavio defeated Lizardo. However, Lizardo's brain is still alive, and Tristan, a man from the present time, becomes the Panday in Flavio's stead, as Flavio ascended to Heaven. The theme song entitled \\"Makita Kang Muli\\" (To See You Again) is performed by Sugarfree and it is included on their second album. According to Spot.PH, this series is one of best fantasy series in Philippine television. In 2010, after the film Dugo ng Panday that starred Bong Revilla as Flavio was released, GMA Network aired its spin-off, Panday Kids. It is a re-imagining of the Panday franchise of Carlo J. Caparas as well as a homage to Poe's film character. The series is about the three young descendants prophesied to combat evil and preserve the Panday spirit by protecting the legendary sword. It stars Robert Villar, Sabrina Man and Julian Marcus Trono as the Panday kids. Marvin Agustin played the main nemesis of Flavio, Lizardo, who previously played by Philip Salvador from the Ang Panday reboot film. Iza Calzado, who is from the previous film, reprised her role as Maria Makiling. The theme song of the series is performed by Parokya ni Edgar. In 2016, TV5 aired its first TV series remake of the series, Ang Panday starring Richard Gutierrez as Flavio. The series was co-produced by Viva Television with TV5. Caparas was heavily involved in this project and he said that the series features three parts: a prequel, the story about Flavio and his journey to becoming the Panday. In this version, Flavio is a foundling and was raised by a priest. He also has a brother who was raised by bad elements. Chistopher de Leon portrayed the antagonist Lizardo. See also *Carlo J.

Wave Dragon is a joint EU research project, including partners from Austria, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, Sweden, and the UK. It was the world's first offshore wave energy converter. History The 237 ton prototype Wave Dragon was towed in March 2003 to the first test site at the Danish Wave Energy Test Center in Nissum Bredning fjord. It was tested until January 2005. In 2006 a modified prototype was deployed to another test site with more energetic wave climate. The prototype was scrapped in 2011. Technology Wave Dragon seen from reflector, prototype 1:4¬Ω Wave Dragon is a floating, slack-moored energy converter of the 'overtopping' type which can be deployed as a single unit, or in arrays of up to 200 units; the output of such an array would have a capacity comparable to traditional fossil-fuel power plants. The first prototype was connected to the power grid in 2003 and is currently deployed in Nissum Bredning, Denmark. Long term testing is under way to determine system performance; i.e. availability and power production under different weather and tide conditions. A multi-MW deployment is expected in 2009. The Wave Dragon concept combines existing, mature offshore and hydro turbine technology. In the Wave Dragon, the Kaplan turbine is being tested at the Technical University of Munich. This turbine uses a siphon inlet whereas the next 6 turbines to be installed will be equipped with a cylinder gate to start and stop water inlet to the turbine.Keulenaer, H. http://www.leonardo- energy.org/wave-dragon, 2007-04-13. Retrieved on 2013-01-23: Principles =Construction= Over topping principle of Wave Dragon Wave Dragon uses principles from traditional hydropower plants in an offshore floating platform to use wave energy. The Wave Dragon consists of two wave reflectors that direct the waves towards a ramp. Behind the ramp, a large reservoir collects the directed water, and temporarily stores the water. The reservoir is held above sea level. The water leaves the reservoir through hydro turbines.Wave Dragon Wave Dragon Homepage, Retrieved on 2008-04-10: Three-step energy conversion: Overtopping (absorption) -> Storage (reservoir) -> Power-take-off (low-head turbines) Main components of a Wave Dragon: *Main body with a double curved ramp (reinforced concrete and/or steel construction) *Two wave reflectors in reinforced concrete and/or steel *Mooring system *Propeller turbines *Permanent Magnet Generators =Design= Wave energy converters make use of the mechanical motion or fluid pressure. Wave Dragon does not have any conversion, e.g. oscillating water/air columns, hinged rafts, and gyroscopic/hydraulic devices. The Wave Dragon directly utilises the energy of the water's motion. The Wave Dragon is of heavy, durable construction and has only one kind of moving parts: the turbines. This is essential for any device bound for operations offshore, where extreme conditions and fouling, etc., seriously affect any moving parts. Wave Dragon model testing has been used in order to: *Optimize 'overtopping' *Refine hydraulic response: anti-pitching and anti-rolling. *Reduce stress on wave reflectors and the mooring system, etc. * Reduce construction costs, maintenance and running costs. Main body The main body to or platform consists of one large floating reservoir. To reduce rolling and keep the platform stable, the Wave Dragon must be large and heavy. The prototype used in Nissum is of a traditional (ship-like) plate construction of plates of 8 mm steel. The total steel weight of the main body plus the ramp is 150 tons, so that 87 tons of water must be added to achieve the 237 tons total weight needed for stable continuous operation.

Since 1999, it has been a subsidiary of the Swiss Swatch Group. Headquartered in L'Abbaye, Switzerland, Breguet is one of the oldest surviving watchmaking brands and a pioneer of numerous watchmaking technologies such as the tourbillon, which was invented by Abraham Breguet in 1801. Abraham Breguet also invented and produced the world's first self-winding watch (the Perp√©tuelle) in 1780, as well as the world's first wristwatch in 1810 (the Breguet No.2639, for Caroline Bonaparte, Queen of Naples). Breguet is a highly regarded watch manufacturer. Over the years, notable Breguet patrons and timepieces owners include King George III, Queen Victoria, Alexandre I of Russia, Napol√©on Bonaparte, Ettore Bugatti, Sir Winston Churchill, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Gioachino Rossini, Arthur Rubinstein and so on. In particular, the Breguet & Fils, Paris No. 2667 (1814) pocket watch ranks as one of the world's most expensive watches ever sold at auction, fetching US$4.69 million (4,339,000 CHF) in Geneva on 14 May 2012. The Breguet Sympathique Clock No.128 & 5009 (Duc d'Orl√©ans Breguet Sympathique), on the other hand, currently holds the title of the most expensive Breguet timepiece ever sold at auction, fetching 6.80 million US dollars in New York on 4 December 2012. History = Early history = 226x226px Breguet was founded in 1775 by Abraham-Louis Breguet, a Swiss watchmaker born to Huguenot parents in Neuch√¢tel. He studied watchmaking for ten years under Ferdinand Berthoud and Jean-Antoine L√©pine before setting up his own watchmaking business at 51 Quai de l'Horloge on the √éle de la Cit√© in Paris. The dowry that came with his marriage to the daughter of a prosperous French bourgeois provided the backing which allowed him to open his own workshop. Breguet's connections made during his apprenticeship as a watchmaker and as a student of mathematics helped him to establish his business. Following his introduction to the court, Queen Marie Antoinette grew fascinated by Breguet's unique self-winding watch; Louis XVI bought several of his watches. In 1783 the Swedish count Axel Von Fersen, who was the queen's friend and reputed lover, commissioned a watch from Breguet that was to contain every watch complication known at that time as a gift to Marie Antoinette. The result is a Breguet's masterpiece, the Marie- Antoinette pocket watch (Breguet No.160). The business was a success, and around 1807 Abraham-Louis Breguet took on his son Louis-Antoine as his partner, renaming the firm \\"Breguet et Fils\\" (Breguet and Sons). Louis-Antoine took over the firm upon the death of his father in 1823. After Louis-Antoine retired in 1833 (he died in 1858) the business was passed to Abraham-Louis' grandson Louis Cl√©ment Francois (1804‚Äì1883). Abraham-Louis' great-grandson Louis Antoine (1851‚Äì1882) was the last of the Breguet family to run the business. Although he had two sons and a daughter, they did not enter the business, so the Breguet company hired noted English watchmaker Edward Brown of Clerkenwell to manage the Paris factory. Brown eventually became a partner and, after Breguet's grandson's death, the owner and head of the company. When Brown died in 1895 the firm was taken over by his sons, Edward and Henry. On Edward's retirement in the early 1900s, Henry Brown became the head of the firm.Salomons, 1921, pp.7‚Äì8 = Recent development = From 1870 to 1970, Breguet was owned by the English Brown family. But the ownership changed hands several times during the quartz crisis in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1976, Breguet's then-owner Chaumet closed its French factory and moved production to the Vall√©e de Joux in Switzerland. In 1987, Breguet was acquired by Investcorp which, in 1991, created the Groupe Horloger Breguet (GHB). The Breguet Group consists of four subsidiaries: Montres Breguet SA, Breguet SA, Valdar SA and Nouvelle Lemania SA (which Breguet Group acquired in 1992). As a result, Breguet-brand watches are now made at the Nouvelle Lemania factory in Switzerland. In particular, Montres Breguet SA is the main company that sells timepieces under the brand name of \\"Breguet\\", and Breguet SA is the name of Breguet Group's distribution company in France. In 1999, Groupe Horloger Breguet was acquired by the Swatch Group from Investcorp. Breguet is an active member of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry FH.  Motto and slogan  One of Breguet's company mottoes is \\"In every woman is a queen.\\" The motto was introduced for Breguet's lady's collection, the Reine de Naples collection. Watch manufacturing A Breguet pocket watch in the alt= Breguet watches are often easily recognized for their coin-edge cases, guilloch√© dials and blue pomme hands (often now referred to as 'Breguet hands'). In addition to watches, Breguet also manufactures writing instruments, women's jewelry, and cufflinks. = Notable inventions and patents = The following are some of the important inventions of Abraham-Louis Breguet and Breguet company. * In 1780, invented and produced the world's self-winding/automatic watch (the Perp√©tuelle). *In 1783, invented the Gong-spring, laying the foundation for minute repeaters. * In 1783, invented the Breguet hands. * In 1790, invented the Pare-chute, one of the world's first shock protection systems. * In 1795, invented the Breguet overcoil or Breguet spiral, being widely used in watchmaking industry to this day. * In 1801, invented tourbillon, balancing the effect of gravity. * In 1810, invented and produced the world's first wristwatch (Breguet No. 2639).\\"Histoire de la Maison Breguet\\" , Tendance Horlogerie, 16 April 2009 (French) *In 1929, created the world's first (possibly) perpetual calendar movement for wristwatches (Breguet No. 2516). * In 2010, patented the magnetic pivot, used to improve watch precision using magnetism. *In 2010, introduced the magnetic strike governor. = Environmental rating = Top 5 gold producing nations In December 2018, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) released an official report giving environmental ratings for 15 major watch manufacturers and jewelers in Switzerland. Breguet, along with 7 other manufacturers including Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet and Rolex, was given the lowest environmental rating as \\"Latecomers/Non- transparent\\", suggesting that the manufacturer has taken very few actions addressing the impact of its manufacturing activities on the environment and climate change. There are concerns over the lack of transparency in manufacturing activities and the sourcing of precious raw materials such as gold, which is a major cause of environmental issues such as pollution, soil degradation and deforestation. The situation is especially serious in the developing countries which are top producers of gold, including China, Russia and South Africa. It is estimated that the watch and jewelry sector uses over 50% of world's annual gold production (over 2,000 tons), but in most cases the watch companies are not able to or are unwilling to demonstrate where their raw materials come from and if the material suppliers use eco-friendly sourcing technologies.  Notable models  = Most expensive pieces = Breguet No.160, Marie-Antoinette pocket watch * On 14 May 2012, a Breguet pocket watch, the Breguet & Fils, Paris No.2667, was sold in Christie's Geneva auction with a final price of 4.69 million US dollars (CHF 4,339,000). * On 14 May 2012, a Breguet pocket watch, the Breguet, Paris, No.4111, was sold in Christie's Geneva auction with a final price of 2.75 million US dollars (CHF 2,547,000). *On 4 December 2012, the Breguet Sympathique Clock No.128 & 5009 (Duc d'Orl√©ans Breguet Sympathique, owned by Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans) was auctioned by Sotheby's for 6.8025 million US dollars in New York, making it the most expensive Breguet timepiece ever sold at auction. The clock was auctioned by Sotheby's for the first time in 1999, fetching a record- breaking US$5,777,500 in New York, after the shutdown of the celebrated Time Museum in Rockford, Illinois. *On 16 May 2016, a Breguet pocket watch, the Breguet & Fils, No.217, was sold in Christie's Geneva auction with a final price of 3.33 million US dollars (CHF 3,245,000). = Marie-Antoinette pocket watch = In 1783, an admirer of Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France, commissioned a watch from Abraham-Louis Breguet as a gift for the Queen. The requirement was that the watch should be \\"as spectacular as possible, incorporating the fullest range of horological expertise known at the time\\". There was no time deadline or financial limit with the commission. The final product was the Breguet No.160 grand complication (Marie-Antoinette pocket watch). However, the watch was only finished in 1827, 34 years after the death of the Queen during French Revolution, and 4 years after the death of Abraham- Louis Breguet (the watch was eventually completed by the son of Abraham Breguet). In total, it took 44 years to make the watch. The watch had been kept in the Museum for Islamic Art in Jerusalem until it was stolen in 1983. In 2007, the watch was eventually recovered and returned to the museum. = Gentleman's collection = *Classique: Simple, Grandes Complications ‚Äì popular round pieces, usually with reeded casebands and soldered lugs; **The Classique Tourbillon Extra-Flat, available in rose gold or platinum. **The Classique Small Seconds, available in rose gold or in white gold. *La Marine ‚Äì water- resistant, distinguished by the presence of crown guards; *Heritage ‚Äì tonneau- shaped cases; *Type XX, XXI, XXII ‚Äì sports chronographs, based on World War II-era pilots' watches; **The Type XXII Flyback Chronograph, available in rose gold. *Tradition ‚Äì similar to the long gone Souscription by Breguet, open- faced watches with the movement on the front, along with a small face. = Lady's collection = *Classique; *La Marine; *Heritage; *Type XX; Reine de Naples ‚Äì oval bezels.

The line was developed by Robert Stephenson following the great success of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway line. The Victorian era new towns of Wolverton and New Bradwell were built to house the workers and service the works. The older towns of Stony Stratford and Newport Pagnell grew substantially too, being joined to it by the Wolverton and Stony Stratford Tramway and the Wolverton to Newport Pagnell Line (a branch line), respectively. The trams were also hauled by steam locomotives: the tram cars were certainly the largest ever in the UK and possibly the world. In modern times Wolverton railway works remains notable as the home of the British Royal Train but otherwise is very much reduced from its heyday. , the facility is much reduced: a full-scale train maintenance, repairs and refurbishment works is operated at the western end of the site, the central area is derelict but slated for redevelopment, the eastern end is a Tesco store with canal-side housing development at the extreme eastern end. History =Foundation= Old Wolverton railway works with Stephenson bridge, adjoins and crosses the Grand Union Canal The 1833 Act of Parliament approving the London and Birmingham Railway included a clause that specified that a railway works be built around the mid-point, as it was considered scientifically unsafe at the time for railway locomotives to move more than without further inspection. After surveying all possible sites, Wolverton was chosen due to its co-location alongside the wharfing facilities of the Grand Union Canal, there-by also enabling the railway company to gain an easy agreement to build a viaduct over the canal company's land at this point. The actual site was selected in October 1836 by Edward Bury, an engineer and locomotive manufacturer of Liverpool, who had been appointed in May 1836 as contractor for working the company's trains. Under this arrangement, the company would provide locomotives to Bury's specification while he would maintain them in good repair and convey passengers and goods at a rate per person, per ton and per mile, at a speed not exceeding . Seven manufacturers, including Bury's firm, supplied the original stock of engines. Because of the unforeseen demand for increased speed, this contract for working the line was annulled in July 1839; thereafter Bury was employed as the Manager of the Locomotive Department on a salary, with a profits bonus.Harry Jack: Locomotives of the LNWR Southern Division. =Locomotive Works= At first the Works was used for the maintenance and repair of locomotives purchased from outside firms. Two locomotives were built there in 1845/6, and another in 1848, but following enlargement of the buildings and increased facilities, they were turned out in quantity. In total, 166 locomotives were built at Wolverton. These included three varieties of the 2-2-2 LNWR Bloomer Class, 86 of the Wolverton Express Goods 0-6-0 and four varieties of 0-4-2. In 1846 the London & Birmingham became part of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR); Bury resigned in 1847 and was succeeded by James E. McConnell as Locomotive Superintendent of the LNWR Southern Division. An innovative engineer who during his tenure experimented with hollow axles, rubber springs, brakes working on the rails, and elaborate boilers and fireboxes, but perhaps his greatest claim to fame is the 2-2-2 Bloomer type of 1851, which was closely based on a Bury design. A total of seventy-four were built in three classes between 1851 and 1862, similar in design and layout but different in dimensions. In 1861 the cost-conscious Richard Moon was appointed Chairman of the LNWR, and became very critical of McConnell; after the Board passed a motion of censure on him, McConnell was obliged to resign in March 1862. In 1862, Moon drove through a policy that Crewe would become the sole locomotive manufacturing centre for the LNWR, and so the last of the 166 Wolverton-built locomotives left the works in September 1863. =Carriage works= Having retained its maintenance role, in 1865 Wolverton was designated as the LNWR Carriage Works, eventually becoming the largest carriage works in the UK. Initially Wolverton produced numbers of six-wheel carriages on a rigid wheelbase. In 1873 a sleeper service was introduced to Glasgow, and in 1875 to Liverpool and Holyhead. The carriages for these were again three-axle, limited it is said, to by the traverser in the Euston carriage sheds. This remained the pattern for many years, though some used Webb's patent \\"radial truck\\". The 1880s saw the introduction of first-class twin-car sets with an interconnecting gangway. The 1881 sleeping cars for the Irish Mail were of this form, and in 1889 some of the first-class twins were adapted to become the LNWR's first dining cars. In 1883, sleeping cars were introduced on the Glasgow service but, though bogies had come into use on other railways, the LNWR preferred to simply add an extra radial truck. This configuration remained in use until 1893, when Charles Park built a rake of corridor coaches for the expresses to Edinburgh with six-wheeled bogies. This was first and third class only, although second class remained for many other services until 1911. In 1892, the non-automatic brake finally disappeared and in 1896 Stone's patent electric train lighting was introduced, along with communication cords. =Twentieth century= In 1901, Wolverton was the first railway works to use electricity for lighting and driving machinery throughout. All coaches for principal services now included corridor connections and were mounted on bogies instead of radial trucks. During World War I, the works altered carriages to be used as ambulance trains both within the UK and overseas. Part of the works was also turned over for use by the Ministry of Munitions. In 1923, when the LNWR merged into the LMS, wagon building was introduced. From 1926 the works was supplied with electricity from Northampton Power Station. At the outbreak of World War II, as a major manufacturing facility, the works was camouflaged, with the exterior walls still showing signs of green paint. No Luftwaffe bombs landed on Wolverton,http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/centre-for- buckinghamshire-studies/online-resources/bombs-over-bucks/ although nearby New Bradwell suffered the destruction of some housing and the loss of five lives due to aerial bombing.New Bradwell The works itself ceased all railway- associated work, instead using its vast engineering and wood working to produce Horsa gliders for the D-Day airborne assault. It also repaired Whitley bombers, Hawker Typhoon wings and converted some seven hundred commercial motor vans into armoured vehicles. Post-war it continued its carriage and work construction work, including making large numbers of the all-new British Railways Mark 1 carriage, until the intervention of Dr. Beeching. In 1962, the works was downgraded to a repair facility, with the last new vehicle being completed in 1963. By 1964 the workforce had dropped from 4000 to 2000, but the works had picked up new work through the repair and maintenance of the British Rail Class 304 Electric Multiple Units. Although no new general service carriages were built, twenty four vehicles were built in 1977 for the Royal Mail, and twenty one diesel multiple units for the Northern Ireland Railways. In February 1986 British Rail Engineering Limited split into two new groups, with Wolverton becoming part of the new BR Maintenance Group, which again reduced staff to 850. =Royal train= Wolverton has a long history associated with providing carriages for the British Royal Train. The works produced Queen Victoria's 1869 saloon, comprising two six-wheelers joined by the first bellows gangway in Europe; the carriage is now part of the collection of the National Railway Museum, York. Further Royal coaches were built in 1903 for King Edward VII, and in 1961 for Queen Elizabeth II. The most recent Royal train was fitted out at Wolverton in 1977. It comprises eight prototype British Rail Mark 3 coaches built in 1972 for the High Speed Train, refurbished with two Royal Saloons. The Royal Train is operated and maintained by DB Schenker and stored within the remaining Knorr Bremse service depot. Ownership and management of the Royal Train Service is with Network Rail.Official Website of the British Monarchy =21st century= The carriage maintenance works was consolidated its operations in the western end of the site. In July 2013, the then operators, Railcare, entered administration, with immediate redundancy for many of the 225 workforce.Railcare jobs to go in Glasgow and Milton Keynes BBC, 2 August 2013) In August 2013, Knorr-Bremse purchased Railcare, including the sites in Glasgow and Wolverton. The company operated as KnorrBremse RailServices (UK) Limited, until 9 November 2018, when the business was bought by Mutares. Wolverton Works is now operated by Gemini Rail Services UK Limited (a division of Mutares), although the site is owned by the St. Modwen Properties plc development group. The eastern end of the original works site has become a canal-side housing development: some new build and some repurposed historic buildings. The central area is now a Tesco supermarket, a community centre and a Lidl supermarket. The Tesco frontage has been built to resemble the original buildings and a small independent shop on Stratford Rd displays the sign of the LNWR fire station formerly on that site. Further abandoned buildings remain and their redevelopment is anticipated in the town plan. The marshalling yards by the West Coast Main Line are used as an entrepot for white goods, but this is purely a road distribution centre and there are no rail links to the warehouses, although the rail works access line is close by. Heritage =Listed structures= Stephenson bridge made from cast iron girders Landslip on Wolverton viaduct The original bridge across the Grand Union canal was built in 1834-5 (chief engineer, Robert Stephenson) and is a Grade II* listed monument. The bridge is composed of numerous cast iron girders, many made by the Butterley Company Iron works. It is a rare survival since most similar bridges were removed at the end of the Victorian era. The more imposing Wolverton viaduct to the north of the old station yard is one of the most impressive viaducts on the line, and was built in 1838 across the River Ouse valley. There were many problems encountered during construction, especially landslips on the adjacent embankment. They can still be seen just south of the viaduct and were portrayed by John Cooke Bourne in his description of the railway published just after it had opened.. =Archives and artefacts= A variety of archival material and artefacts from the Works is stored at the nearby Milton Keynes Museum.

Its wood is often traded as Argentine lignum vitae or Paraguay lignum vitae, since it has properties and uses similar to the \\"true\\" lignum vitae trees of genus Guaiacum, which are close relatives. Another trade name is \\"vera\\" or \\"verawood\\", which may also refer to the even more closely related B. arborea. Another common but rather ambiguous name is \\"palo santo\\" (Spanish: \\"holy wood\\"), which it shares with the species Bursera graveolens. It is also known as ibioca√≠ in Argentina. Bulnesia sarmientoi heartwood is brown, black, and green (varying in color from light olive green to chocolate brown), with streaks. The sapwood is mostly thin and light yellow. The basic specific gravity of this wood is between 0.92 and 1.1 g/cm¬≥. Conservation Bulnesia sarmientoi was listed as endangered in the 2018 publication of the IUCN Red List, due to the deforestation of Gran Chaco and a strong global demand for its wood, extracts, and essential oils since 2001. IUCN estimates indicate that over three generations the global population will decline by around 50%. Previously, it was listed as lower risk/conservation dependent in the 1998 publication of the IUCN Red List. It has been listed in Appendix II of CITES since 2010. Uses Wood of B. sarmientoi Palo santo is employed for engraving work and for the making of durable wooden posts. From its wood, also, a type of oil known as oil of guaiac (or guayacol) is produced, to be used as an ingredient for soaps and perfumes. Its resin can be obtained by means of organic solvents, and is employed to make varnishes and dark paints. Palo santo wood has also been used in indigenous medicine in South America. In northwest Argentina, the Criollo people burned the wood of Aura palo santo together with the leaves of Ruta chalepensis. The resulting smoke was blown into the ears of patients with otitis. Palo santo is appreciated for the skin- healing properties of its essence and also because it provides good charcoal and a high quality timber. It ignites easily despite being so dense, and produces a fragrant smoke. Natives of the Chaco region employ the bark to treat stomach problems. Small pieces of the wood are also used as a form of natural incense in spiritual rituals. Mat√© infusion, served in a mat√© / guampa (traditional mat√© cup) carved from the wood of B. sarmientoi. In it a metal bombilla (drinking straw), with which to suck up the infusion. American beer micro brewer Dogfish Head regularly produces a beer called \\"Palo Santo Marron\\" that is aged in tanks made of palo santo wood. References Further reading *Richter, H. G. and M. J.

Transport Bassendean rail museum A depot existed at Zanthus prior to 1915 when the east to west section of the Trans Australian Railway was still not completed. Trains were arriving daily at the station in 1915 mostly carrying materials to the railhead from Kalgoorlie. Passengers were stranded at Zanthus in 1948 when a train was delayed resulting from floodwaters causing washaways along the tracks between Zanthus and Kalgoorlie. Several passengers completed the journey to Kalgoorlie via a Goldfield Airways airplane while over 50 men worked to fix the two big washaways. A derailment of a train occurred in 1953 when five coaches of the transcontinental eastbound express left the tracks near the town tearing up a section of the line. Repair crews worked through the night and built a deviation by the following day. In 1975, large amounts of rain had inundated inland Western Australia from the remnants of Cyclone Trixie. A large washaway close to Zanthus had resulted in the closure of the line. A new bridge was constructed as part of the repairs in just two weeks. Zanthus has a crossing loop on the line. On 8 August 1999, the Indian Pacific passenger train collided with a stationary steel train in the area.

KPEN KIOI was first licensed in 1957 as KPEN, licensed to the San Francisco Peninsula community of Atherton, California by James Gabbert, a Stanford University engineering major, fellow student Gary M. Gielow, and realtor John S. Wickett, doing business as Peninsula FM. The station was assigned to 101.3 FM, a frequency which had been vacated two years earlier with the deletion of the Oakland Tribune newspaper's KLX-FM,\\"The Short Life of KLX-FM (1948-55)\\" by John F. Schneider, 2014 (theradiohistorian.org) which had begun broadcasting May 3, 1948, simulcasting sister station KLX's programming 17 of the 18 hours it was on daily. KLX-FM was deleted on October 10, 1955.FCC History Cards for KLX-FM (FCC.gov) KPEN debuted on October 27, 1957, with 1,500 watts from a transmitter located on Kings Mountain in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Unusual for the era, KPEN was not affiliated with any stations on the AM band, which meant it had to have 100% original programming. The station put an emphasis on high audio quality, in contrast to other FM stations that did not take advantage of FM broadcasting capabilities. During the day, KPEN played mostly orchestral pop music, switched to a lighter blend of background \\"dinner music\\" in the early evening, then classical music after 8. Eventually Gabbert and Gielow hosted an evening program called Excursions in Sound, which showcased high fidelity recordings and took advantage of the high quality broadcast signal. Two years after KPEN's successful debut, the transmitter was moved to San Bruno Mountain and power increased to 35,000 watts. Then, on August 14, 1964, power was further increased to 125,000 watts, making it the most powerful signal west of the Mississippi River (it was grandfathered in at that power level by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which capped stations in that part of the country at 50,000 watts). KPEN became the first station west of the Mississippi to broadcast in multiplex stereo, officially beginning August 10, 1961, after a series of field tests.KPEN 101.3 FM - Atherton/San Francisco KPEN's technological achievements were recognized by the Electronic Industry Association, the FCC, and President John F. Kennedy. \\"Excursions in Sound\\" was renamed \\"Excursions in Stereo\\"; hosted by James Gabbert, the show focused on recordings that made good use of stereo. Gabbert also had a Sunday afternoon show Anything Goes that played music, sound effects, and almost anything that dramatically demonstrated the stereo effect. In the 1960s, the station moved studios from Atherton to San Francisco, first in a SoMa location, then to Nob Hill in a luxurious penthouse atop 1001 California Street at the corner of Mason Street. With this move, the \\"PEN\\" in KPEN changed from representing \\"PENinsula\\" to representing \\"PENthouse\\". (The same penthouse was later the home of Randolph Hearst, father of kidnapped Patty Hearst.) By the mid-1960s, KPEN played primarily orchestral and light vocal performances of pop songs and standards, in competition with similar FM station KFOG (owned by Kaiser Broadcasting). K-101 On December 1, 1968, KPEN changed its call letters to KIOI (\\"K-101\\"), considered an innovative matching of call letters to a dial position. Eventually, the station added pop and rock music to its MOR playlist, to compete with upstart freeform rock stations KMPX and KSAN. Gabbert aggressively began promoting the station via outdoor advertising, which was a first for the market. \\"K-101\\" is likely the first station in the country to develop what is now called the adult contemporary format. Even though KIOI's programming was mainly focused on music, it also featured many popular on-air personalities over the years including Don Kelly, Bill Keffury, Hoyt Smith and Jeff Serr. By 1970, K-101 advertised itself as being at 101 on the FM dial and had the address of 1001 California Street, with Zip Code 94101. During the 1970s, Gabbert developed another lasting technological achievement as KIOI became the first station in the country to develop circular polarization, which was a key element to FM reception in automobiles, which used to be difficult. Gabbert also experimented with quadraphonic sound (in association with RKO General's KFMS-FM). By the mid-1970s, Gabbert purchased KSAY-AM, changing its call letters to KIQI. Originally programmed as an oldies station, by the end of the decade, it was flipped to a Spanish language format. In September 1980, Gabbert sold KIOI to Charter Company for $12.5 million, then the highest price paid for an FM station. He then purchased KEMO-TV (Channel 20) in San Francisco, changing the call letters to KTZO (\\"TV 20\\"). Gabbert later returned to local radio when he purchased KHIT- FM, KOFY (1050 AM) and KDIA (1310 AM). KIOI was profitable, however, various management tweaked the format to compete with market leader KOIT at various times, leaning softer-AC, or would lean towards Hot AC, which they retained throughout the 80s. In February 1996, sister station WYNY in New York simulcast KIOI for a day as part of a week-long stunt of simulcasting sister stations nationwide before flipping formats to rhythmic adult contemporary as WKTU. Star 101.3 During the late 1990s, KIOI was flanked by soft AC KOIT and the emerging CHR KZQZ, and suffered in the ratings. The re-emergence of the CHR format by core artists such as Backstreet Boys, NSync, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera forced KIOI to a Hot AC format and re-branded itself as \\"The New K-101\\". The station remained competitive; however, the station clearly suffered an identity crisis as the ratings did not improve with the Hot AC approach. On November 16, 2000, the station rebranded itself as \\"Star 101.3\\" and debuted an exclusive \\"all-80s hits\\" format that had been successful in other markets, especially in San Jose on sister station KCNL, as well as Portland and Seattle. The first song on \\"Star\\" was \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\" by Simple Minds.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2000/RR-2000-11-24.pdf \\"Star\\" was programmed by KCNL Program Director Gary Schoenwetter, who brought San Francisco legend and former KITS- FM jock Steve Masters for Afternoon Drive. Though the station performed well for a while with its 1980s format, management decided to take the station back to the Hot AC format and abandoned the 1980s format (which was picked up 14 years later by sister station KOSF) by January 2002, while letting go Schoenwetter, Masters, and other on-air talent.Sullivan, James. \\"The '80s are so over, on the radio, at least.\\" THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE, FINAL ed., sec.

Throughout the changes, local morning host Don Bleu has remained consistent and more importantly, a ratings success through various co-hosts Renee Brinkley (1998‚Äì2002), Uzette Salazar (2002‚Äì2006), April Sommers (2006‚Äì2010) and Trish Jentz (2010‚Äìpresent). Bleu is a Minnesota native, who was also well known at KYUU in San Francisco and KDWB in Minneapolis. Popular show segments during Bleu's morning show included Bleuper calls (prank calls to unsuspecting listeners), The Daily Dish (entertainment gossip), and the Bleu Room, an in- studio lounge session that featured acts including Dido, Natasha Bedingfield, Matchbox Twenty and others performing acoustic versions of their hits. Since June 30, 2008, afternoon drive has been hosted by the nationally syndicated On-Air with Ryan Seacrest program with cut-aways to local traffic by Dina Lawrence. Also in the line-up is the Hot Adult Contemporary version of American Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest, which airs on Sunday mornings. In January 2012, Bleu moved over to mornings at sister station KOSF. In June, Frosty Stillwell, formerly of KLSX in Los Angeles, and Sandy Stec, formerly of KEZR in San Jose, were announced as KIOI's new morning hosts. (Frosty would later leave the station and be replaced by Marcus D. Najera, formerly of KLLC.) Boosters HD Programming On January 19, 2006, Star 101.3 entered the HD Radio world with an HD-2 channel. The channel was originally an All '80s music format, reflecting back to the days when the station used to air 1980s hits upon rebranding itself as Star 101.3 from K-101. The music featured the best songs from the 1980s from acts like The Police, Prince, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Cyndi Lauper, and more. The format would later be replaced with a Dance hits format, carrying iHeart's \\"Pride Radio\\" network, targeting the LGBTQ community.

It is located in the town of Crewe, in Cheshire. It is currently owned by Bombardier Transportation. The railway also built 200 cottages, establishing a new community in what had been the rural township of Monks Coppenhall. Among the first workers to arrive were those from the old works at Edge Hill, producing an increase in the town's population by some 800 men, women and children.  History  = Grand Junction Railway = The first locomotive built at Crewe went into service in 1843. By 1846, the demand for space was such that wagon building was moved, first to Edge Hill and Manchester, then to a new works at Earlestown. By 1848, the works employed over 1,000 producing one locomotive a week. = London and North Western Railway = In 1845, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was merged with the Grand Junction. These, in turn, merged in 1846, with the London and Birmingham Railway and the Manchester and Birmingham Railway to form the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). All four had their own workshops but, in time, locomotive building was concentrated at Crewe. In 1857, John Ramsbottom became Locomotive Superintendent. He had previously invented the first reliable safety valve and the scoop for picking up water from troughs between the tracks. He went on to improve the precision and interchangeability of tools and components. In 1862, locomotive work was transferred from Wolverton. Wolverton became the carriage works, while wagon building was concentrated at Earlestown. In 1853, Crewe had begun to make its own wrought iron and roll its own rails, and in 1864 installed a Bessemer converter for manufacturing steel. In 1868 it became the first place to use open-hearth furnaces on an industrial scale. It also built its own brickworks. Later the works was fitted with two electric arc furnaces. Production increased steadily and, with the sale to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway of ten 2-4-0 and eighty six 0-6-0 locomotives, privately owned manufacturers took out an injunction in 1876 to restrain the railway from producing anything but its own needs. This remained in force until British Rail Engineering Limited was established in 1969. = London Midland and Scottish Railway = Royal Scot Class No. 46123 Royal Irish Fusilers receiving attention at Crewe Works with other locomotives When the LNWR became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923, its passenger locomotives were eclipsed by those of the former Midland Railway, which offered light, fast and frequent services. As traffic density increased, there was a need for longer trains and more powerful locomotives to haul them. In 1932, William Stanier became Chief Mechanical Engineer and set out to rationalise production. Since Crewe had experience with heavier locomotives and had its own steel making facilities, he chose it as his main production location. There followed the Princesses and Duchesses, along with the Jubilees and the \\"Black Fives\\". Crewe produced all the new boilers for the LMS, and all heavy drop stampings and forgings. It also produced most of the heavy steel components for the track and other structures. During World War II, Crewe produced over 150 Covenanter tanks for the army.

Buxton shed August 1960. After British Railways (BR) was formed in 1948, Robert Riddles introduced the BR standard classes, and Crewe built Britannia and Clan mixed traffic engines and some of the Class 9 freight locomotives. The last steam locomotive built at Crewe, Class 9 number 92250, was completed in December 1958. Crewe Works built 7,331 steam locomotives.Last Steam Locomotive from Crewe Works Railway Gazette 26 December 1958 page 762 Diesel production commenced, with D5030 the first main line example completed in 1959.Crewe Works Builds Its First Main-Line Diesel- Electric Locomotive Railway Gazette 26 June 1959 The final diesel locomotives built at Crewe Works were the Class 56 with the last completed in 1984, while the final class of electric locomotives were the Class 91 with the last completed in 1991.The Making of Crewe and What Made Crewe The Railway Magazine issue 1254 October 2005 pages 14-23 = Privatisation = Much of the site at Crewe was cleared in a major redevelopment in the mid 1980s. Crewe Works became a part of British Rail Engineering Limited when the former BR Workshops were set up as a separate business in 1969 and was privatised in 1989. This company was soon sold to ASEA Brown-Boveri, which merged with Daimler Benz in 1996 to form Adtranz. Adtranz was itself taken over by Bombardier in 2001.Bombardier cleared to buy Adtranz Railway Gazette International May 2001 = Today = At its height, Crewe Works employed over 20,000 people; in 2005 fewer than 1,000 remained on site, with a further 270 redundancies announced in November of that year and more cutbacks or even closure possible. Current work is largely focused on general maintenance and the inspection of seriously damaged stock. Much of the site once occupied by the works has been sold off and is now occupied by a supermarket, leisure park and a large new health centre. Internal railway From 1862 until 1932, the works was served by an internal narrow gauge tramway, the Crewe Works Railway. In fiction In The Railway Series, as well as Thomas and Friends, Henry the Green Engine underwent a rebuild there after he crashed into a goods train while pulling the Flying Kipper.  Locomotive production  Under the London and North Western Railway, Crewe Works produced many famous locomotives: the Webb Jumbo class and the compounds, the Whale Experiment and Precursor classes, and the Bowen-Cooke Claughtons. In particular, Whale's 1912 superheated G1 Class developed from a locomotive introduced by Webb in 1892, lasted, in many cases until 1964, near the end of steam in 1968. Under the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, the works was especially noted for Sir William Stanier's locomotives and in particular the 'Jubilee' s, the Class 5 mixed traffic s and the 'Princess Royal' and 'Princess Coronation' s. Under British Railways, the works built many notable steam designs including the Britannia s and the Franco-Crosti boilered Class 9 freight locomotives.

The music originally featured was jazz, blues and R&B; from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. In the summer of 1982, KPOO started playing rap music on Sunday afternoons from 3pm-7pm with DJ LeBaron Lord King, becoming the first radio station on the West Coast with a rap show. For several years this was the only radio station in the Bay Area that played rap music with live interviews. Rap became a staple of choice music on some of the station's other programs and two years later other Bay Area stations followed KPOO's lead. KPOO is the only place to hear local public commentaries and talk programs with community and national Black leaders discussing what's going on in the Black community locally and nationally. The focus on the community continues with commentaries on a variety of talk and music programs.

In 1939, the station was sold to the owners of San Francisco‚Äôs KTAB, who, in turn, were required to sell it in 1944 as a result of the FCC‚Äôs ‚ÄúDuopoly‚Äù edict, which forbade ownership of more than one station in a market area. On December 19, 1944, Sheldon F. Sackett, publisher of the Oakland-based Olympic Press weekly newspaper, bought KROW for $250,000 and continued operating it until May 1959.\\" The Oakland Post-Enquirer wanted a radio station to compete with the Oakland Tribune's KLX. This station became KROW in June 1930, and used those call letters until 1959. It was a full- service station known for launching the career of comedian Phyllis Diller and for helping the career of \\"the world's greatest disc jockey\\" Don Sherwood, prior to his great career at KSFO. In 1947, the station built a new transmitter on a 20-acre island leased from the Port of Oakland. The new transmitter was accompanied by an increase in power from 1 KW to 5 KW full- time. =KABL= This station is best known as the longtime home of KABL, the successor to KROW and one of the first beautiful music stations in the United States, owned by 1950s radio pioneer Gordon McLendon. The genesis of KABL According to longtime McLendon national program director, Don Keyes (d. 2006), in his book Gordon McLendon and Me, McLendon wanted to own a station in the San Francisco market, and 960 KROW seemed ideal because of its relatively low dial position and strong coverage of the San Francisco market. The original plan had been to launch a Top 40 format on KROW, but after McLendon and his team visited the market and discovered there were already several Top 40 stations, they decided there wasn't room for another one. As a result, they looked to KIXL, a beautiful-music station in the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, market that was enjoying a fair amount of success despite being daytime-only, and decided to launch a similar format on KROW using KIXL's formula of quarter-hour blocks of familiar musical selections (three instrumentals, arranged by tempo, and one vocal) as a template. The new calls were to be KABL, as in San Francisco's legendary cable cars. In early May 1959, KROW began \\"stunting\\" with a continuous loop of a song called \\"Gila Monster,\\" the theme song from a horror film that Gordon McLendon had co- produced that year. Based on this stunt, it was assumed by the general public ‚Äî and by the competition ‚Äî that KROW was to become a Top 40 station along the lines of McLendon's KLIF in Dallas, WAKY in Louisville or KILT in Houston, but the station then proceeded to take everyone by surprise by debuting KABL as a beautiful music station. KABL quickly captured the erudite listening audience that disliked rock and roll and soon became the number one radio station in San Francisco, and would remain at or near the top of the ratings for years afterward. KABL's format As KABL, the station combined a mixture of easy listening string and orchestra music with light classics and an occasional Latin cocktail hour tune. KABL was known for presenting poetic vignettes about San Francisco life, a harp interlude between songs, and a cable car bell to announce the news. Licensed to Oakland, with a transmitter near the east end of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge, KABL was also noted in radio history for its failure to properly identify its city of license. While KABL could have legally identified as \\"Oakland/San Francisco,\\" it instead deliberately tried to identify with San Francisco rather than Oakland. It was notorious for using slogans such as \\"KABL Oakland, serving San Francisco on your San Francisco radio dial, in the air, everywhere over San Francisco\\". This raised the ire of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), resulting in a fine and an admonishment to all broadcasters that they were licensed to serve a particular community, not surrounding ones. The final years In 1997, the station switched to an adult standards format of traditional pop and big band music. At one point, presumably inspired by the \\"swing dancing/zoot suits\\" craze of the late 1990s, they added a nightly \\"swing/dance\\" show several hours in length, which played music by the retro swing groups of the period such as Brian Setzer's and the Cherry Poppin' Daddies, as well as standard material such as Glenn Miller's \\"In The Mood\\". This program didn't last very long. They also carried the syndicated When Radio Was Old-Time Radio anthology series, tending to move its time slot around. In 2000, they briefly switched to a 1960s-1970s soft rock format, but went back to older music after complaints from their regular audience. In fact, later-years KABL tended to go back and forth on including greater amounts of more \\"modern\\" softer pop-rock material then not identified with \\"traditional\\" adult standards - Peter & Gordon and Dusty Springfield from the '60s, even Kenny Rogers and Air Supply from the turn of the '80s. On September 28, 2004, 960 AM dropped the adult standards programming and the KABL call letters. KABL subsequently reemerged at then co-owned 92.1 FM in Walnut Creek, California. The station had a very limited signal beyond its immediate broadcast area, however, and in July 2005, switched to an adult contemporary music format. KABL reborn on the Internet KABL then began broadcasting as an internet radio station. This lasted until January 31, 2007, when Clear Channel Conmmunications discontinued KABL's streaming music. On June 1, 2007, under license from Clear Channel, the Bay Area Radio Museum launched a streaming tribute to KABL on the Internet, which featured Beautiful Music, Easy Listening, Adult Standards, Big Bands, traditional pop and middle-of-the- road music, to represent the various musical styles presented during the station's forty years on the air. The URL that was used now directs to Clear Channel Corporation's iHeart Radio website. This leaves Radio Sausalito and KCEA as the only two adult standards radio stations in the Bay Area. =Progressive talk as KQKE and KKGN= Replacing KABL on September 28, 2004 were new call letters KQKE and a progressive talk format, branded as \\"960 The Quake\\". The Quake's tag lines are \\"The Bay Area Home of Air America\\", \\"Talk Radio for the Rest of Us\\" and \\"Talk Radio from the Left\\". The station carried a mix of Dial Global programs, such as Ed Schultz, Stephanie Miller and Thom Hartmann, and other distributors. At one time it also carried programs from the now-defunct Air America network. The station also aired some local weekend programming. One weekend show, Shake!, aired on Sunday nights and was targeted toward the Bay Area's gay and lesbian community. The show also aired on co- owned KLSD in San Diego until November 2007. In 2006, KQKE introduced a local morning show featuring political satirist Will Durst and former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown. Keeping it Real with Will and Willie aired from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. Monday through Friday. The show was canceled, and aired its final regular broadcast on September 29, 2006. At that time, the program director indicated that \\"the pair will still do special broadcasts and appearances for the station.\\" John Scott was hired as AM operations manager for both KQKE and KNEW in 2007, and introduced new shows and elements into the programming mix. He would be the last local manager of the stations, with those duties now handled by Clear Channel corporate. In 2009, the station introduced another weekend program, An Organic Conversation, airing Saturdays at 10am PST. Presented by Helge Hellberg, executive director of Marin Organic, and Mark Mulcahy, organic produce consultant, An Organic Conversation features ecology- based thinking and insight into the organic food and holistic health movement. The Progressive News Hour with John Scott once aired weekdays from 6 a.m. to 7 a.m., leading into Keeping it Real with Will and Willie and was a rundown of local and national news, as well as weather and traffic reports. Shortly after Will and Willie disappeared, Stephanie Miller's morning show arrived to take the 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. slot on KQKE. The remodeled show The Progressive News then moved to 4-6PM, and its content was more focused on the Bay Area, including more interviews and news about Bay Area people and politics, with less repetition of national stories. \\"AM 960 The Quake\\" was not related to KQAK, a San Francisco station that was on the air from 1982 to 1985 that also called itself \\"The Quake\\". However, Paul \\"Lobster\\" Wells holds the distinction of working for both \\"Quake\\" stations, as he served as producer and on-air contributor for KQKE's former morning show. KKGN Former Green 960 logo 2010-2012 On August 13, 2007, Clear Channel changed the KQKE call sign to KKGN, with a repositioning as \\"Green 960\\" and initially with programming focused on environmental issues. =KNEW= On January 3, 2012, Clear Channel management changed KKGN to KNEW and shifted to a wider-based talk format. The move was part of a broader restructuring of talk programming in Clear Channel's San Francisco cluster.Clear Channel San Francisco Shuffles Talk Station Lineups All Access Music Group, November 29, 2011 While still predominantly progressive talk for most of the day, KNEW also carried the decidedly conservative Glenn Beck Program during morning drive as well as The Dave Ramsey Show in middays. On January 2, 2014, Rush Limbaugh's daily syndicated program moved from KKSF to KNEW. At this point, KNEW dropped all progressive talk programs, as it flipped to conservative talk and rebranded as \\"The Patriot\\". Affiliation with Bloomberg Radio On September 29, 2014, KNEW dropped conservative talk for business talk programming provided by New York City-based Bloomberg Radio. Limbaugh, Beck, and Hannity's programs were moved to KSFO. On July 30, 2020, KNEW reached an agreement with the Oakland Athletics to broadcast their games for the remainder of the 2020 season, after having initially forewent a radio home in Oakland in favor of streaming only.

During his 2007 UK Tour, Webbe previewed some songs from his third studio album, including \\"Run\\", which he claimed had been announced as the first single. He also claimed that 'Run' could possibly be the title of the album.

Life Born at Cove, Suffolk in December 1689, was the son of Richard Webster (d. 1722), by his wife Jane, daughter of Anthony Sparrow; his father was a nonjuring clergyman, who later submitted and became vicar of Poslingford. Webster was educated at Beccles, and was admitted to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 2 March 1708. He graduated B.A. in 1712, M.A. in 1716, and D.D. in 1732. Webster was ordained deacon on 24 June 1713 as curate of Depden in Suffolk, and priest on 26 February 1716 as curate of St. Dunstan-in-the-West, London. Leaving St. Dunstan's in 1731, he was appointed in August 1732 to the curacy of St Clement, Eastcheap, and in February 1733 was presented to the rectory of Depden. In July 1740 he was instituted to the vicarages of Ware, Hertfordshire and Thundridge, which he retained till his death, resigning his rectory and curacy. In later life he fell into great poverty. He died unmarried at Ware on 4 December 1758. Works Webster was a voluminous writer. In 1723 he edited The Life of General Monk (London), from the manuscript of Thomas Skinner, contributing a preface in vindication of George Monck's character. A second edition appeared in 1724. In 1730 he translated ‚ÄòThe New Testament, with Critical Remarks‚Äô (London, 2 vols.), from the French of Richard Simon. On 16 December 1732, under the pseudonym of ‚ÄòRichard Hooker of the Inner Temple,‚Äô he began to edit a periodical entitled The Weekly Miscellany; not very successful, it was discontinued on 27 June 1741. From the number of religious essays it contained it became known as ‚ÄòOld Mother Hooker's Journal.‚Äô It is known for the attacks made in its columns on William Warburton's Divine Legation of Moses. Webster's contributions to the controversy were republished probably in 1739, under the title of Remarks on the Divine Legation. They earned him a place in the Dunciad, Alexander Pope, in 1742, inserting a passage (bk. ii. l. 258) in which Webster was coupled with George Whitefield, who had also criticised Warburton. In 1740, from materials furnished by a merchant, Webster published a pamphlet on the wool industry called Consequences of Trade to the Wealth and Strength of any Nation, by a Draper of London. It sold well and went into a fifth edition in 1741, the same year as Webster wrote a refutation of his own arguments, published under the pseudonym Andrew Freeport as The Draper Confuted. Christopher Smart addressed to Webster his seventh ode, complimenting him on his ‚ÄòCasuistical Essay on Anger and Forgiveness‚Äô (London, 1750).

They have maintained the traditional form of government led by hereditary Seneca chiefs (sachems) selected by clan mothers. The Seneca are one of the original Five Nations (later six) of the Haudenosaunee or Iroquois Confederacy. Their people speak the Seneca language, an Iroquoian language. The Tonawanda Seneca Nation is one of two federally recognized Seneca tribes in Western New York; the other is the Seneca Nation of Indians. The latter approved a republican constitution in 1848, electing a council and executive officials to govern their lands of the Allegany, Cattaraugus and Oil Springs reservations. The Tonawanda Band opted out of participating in the republic (in part due to hostilities stemming from the Buffalo Creek sale), leading to the band's formation nine years later. In 1857, the Tonawanda Band signed a treaty with the United States (US) and was recognized as a tribe independent of the Seneca Nation of New York. The new treaty with the US allowed the Tonawanda Band to buy back lands from the Ogden Land Company, which had been sold out without their permission in the Treaties of Buffalo Creek. The Tonawanda retrieved the horns of authority and other artifacts from the other Seneca tribes; they re- established a continuation of the traditional Seneca government that existed prior to 1848. They have a matrilineal kinship system; hereditary chiefs are selected through the maternal line by clan mothers. In addition, some Seneca relocated to Indian Territory in the early 19th century; their descendants now form part of the Seneca-Cayuga Nation in present-day Oklahoma. The Cayuga people are another of the Iroquois nations. In the 21st century, the majority of Seneca people live in western New York. A small number live in Canada at the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation within Ontario; they are also descendants of the Keepers of the Western Door. History Jesse Cornplanter, the last descendant of Cornplanter, making a ceremonial mask, Tonawanda Community House, 1940 On 15 January 1838, the United States government entered into the Treaty of Buffalo Creek, with nine Indian nations of New York, including the Seneca. The treaty was part of the United States Indian Removal program, by which they persuaded or forced Native American peoples from eastern states to move west of the Mississippi River to lands reserved for them in the large Kansas Territory (now the state of Kansas and parts of Colorado). This displaced peoples native to those areas. The US wanted the Seneca and other New York tribes to move there to free up lands in New York for European-American settlement. Under the treaty, the US acknowledged that the Ogden Land Company was going to buy the four remaining Seneca reservations in New York. The proceeds would be used to pay for the nation's removal to Kansas Territory.\\"Treaty of Buffalo Creek\\", 15 January 1838, 7 Stat. 550. The US modified the 1838 treaty by the \\"Treaty with the Seneca of 1842\\". The new treaty reflected that the Ogden Land Company had purchased only two reservations, including the Tonawanda Reservation. The Seneca retained the Cattaraugus and Allegany reservations.\\"Treaty with the Seneca of 1842\\", Oklahoma State Library, accessed 22 Mar 2010 At this time, the Seneca of the Tonawanda Reservation protested they had not been consulted on either treaty, nor had their chiefs signed either treaty. They refused to leave their reservation. In 1848, the Seneca Indians of the Cattaraugus and Allegany reservations held a constitutional convention. They adopted a new form of constitution and government modeled on that of the United States, including tribal popular election of chiefs. Traditionally, hereditary chiefs were selected by clan mothers and ruled for life (unless one displeased his clan's mother.) PETER L. POODRY, DAVID C. PETERS, SUSAN LAFROMBOISE, JOHN A.

They reorganized and re-established their traditional government with a council of chiefs representing each of their eight clans. In 1857, under the \\"Treaty with the Seneca, Tonawanda Band\\", the Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians secured federal recognition as an independent Indian nation.\\"Treaty with the Seneca, Tonawanda Band\\", Oklahoma State Library, accessed 22 Mar 2010 With their share of proceeds from the earlier land sale, they bought back most of the Tonawanda Reservation. Under their traditional government, hereditary chiefs typically served for life. They governed by a consensus of leaders of the clans, which formed the basis of the band. The Seneca and all the Iroquois peoples had a matrilineal kinship system, in which descent and property were passed through the maternal line.

He has played a continuing role in the South Africa cricket team as a player and selector. He was voted a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1966. He was primarily a fast bowler, but was also a useful late-order batsman. Family and personal life Pollock is of Scottish ancestry through his father Andrew Pollock, who was born in Edinburgh to a minister and moved to present-day South Africa. Peter's brother, Graeme Pollock, an acclaimed left hand batsman, was a regular player for the South Africa cricket team at the same time as Peter, and two of his nephews also played first-class cricket, both for Transvaal and Leicestershire amongst other sides. Perhaps most famous of all is his son, Shaun Pollock, who played 108 Tests and over 300 ODIs for South Africa and is widely regarded as one of the finest all-rounders to ever play the game. Peter attended Grey High School, a school famous for its sporting achievements, with his brother Graeme. Career On his debut, he took six wickets in the second innings against New Zealand in Durban in 1961. He was South Africa's leading bowler in the 1960s, playing every Test between 1962 and 1970. Perhaps the highlight of his career came alongside that of his brother when they were both playing in a Test match at Trent Bridge in 1965. Peter took ten wickets in the match with innings figures of 5 for 53 and 5 for 34, while his brother Graeme, batting, made 125 and 59. South Africa won the match, and with it the three-Test series. Peter and Graeme were leading figures involved in the famous Walk-off at Newlands in 1971 as a protest against apartheid and political interference in cricket. Post-retirement Pollock was convenor of selectors for South Africa in the 1990s, immediately following their re-admittance into world cricket after the collapse of apartheid. He is often credited with establishing the work ethic and style of play (based on tight fast bowling) that led to the team rapidly rising to become one of the top two teams in the game. Later, he led calls for the famous fast bowler Allan Donald to retire from the game when that player became very injury-prone due to his age. Pollock is an Honorary Life Member of the MCC. Outside cricket, Peter was a journalist and company director and is now an international evangelist. He has written books on cricket and Christian belief.

As the only rail freight corridor between Western Australia and the eastern states, the line is strategically important. The railway includes the world's longest section of completely straight track. The inaugural passenger train service was known as the Great Western Express; later it became the Trans-Australian. , two passenger services use the line, both upmarket tourist services: the Indian Pacific for the entire length of the railway, and The Ghan between Port Augusta and Tarcoola, where it leaves the line to proceed to Darwin. History Cook, once a major station and servicing point In 1901, the six Australian colonies federated to form the Commonwealth of Australia. At that time, Perth, the capital of Western Australia, was isolated from the remaining Australian States by thousands of miles of desert terrain and the only practicable method of transport was by sea, a time-consuming, inconvenient and often uncomfortable voyage across the Great Australian Bight, a stretch of water known for rough seas. One of the inducements held out to Western Australians to join the new federation was the promise of a federally funded railway line linking Western Australia with the rest of the continent. In 1907 legislation was passed, allowing for the route to be surveyed. The survey, completed in 1909, endorsed a route from Port Augusta (the existing railhead at the head of Spencer Gulf in South Australia's wheatfields) via Tarcoola to the gold mining centre of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia, a distance of . The line was to be to the standard gauge of , even though the state railway systems at both ends were narrow gauge at the time. Its cost was estimated at ¬£4,045,000. Legislation authorising the construction was passed in December 1911 by the Fisher Commonwealth Government and work commenced in September 1912 in Port Augusta. Work proceeded eastwards from Kalgoorlie and westwards from Port Augusta through the years of the First World War. By 1915, the two ends of the line were just over apart with materials being delivered daily. Construction progressed steadily as the line was extended through dry and desolate regions until the two halves of the line met at Ooldea on 17 October 1917.Chambers, T.F. (1968) The Golden Jubilee of the Trans Australian Railway Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin November, 1968 pp267-275 Commonwealth Railways was established in 1917 to administer the line. In 1937 the eastern end was extended south to Port Pirie, reducing one break of gauge in the journey across Australia, but at the same time establishing a three-gauge junction at Port Pirie, with the South Australian Railways line to Adelaide being broad gauge. The long-anticipated conversion of the entire line between Sydney and Perth to standard gauge occurred in 1970. In 2004, the gap in standard gauge connections between the mainland state capitals was finally closed with a connection between Port Pirie and Adelaide, thence Melbourne, and by completion of the northern component of the Adelaide‚ÄìDarwin rail corridor, which diverges from the Trans‚ÄìAustralian Railway at Tarcoola. In 2008, the engineering heritage of the railway was recognised by the Engineering Heritage Recognition Program of Engineers Australia when markers were installed on the platform at the Port Augusta station in South Australia and the ticket office at Kalgoorlie station in Western Australia. On 17 October 2017, centenary celebrations were held at Ooldea.Paid subscription required \`subscription\`: the source is only accessible via a paid subscription (\\"paywall\\") Named services When the line was inaugurated, the passenger service was named as the Great Western Express. Later, the train became known as the Trans-Australian or, colloquially, \\"The Trans\\". After the Sydney‚ÄìPerth route was converted to standard gauge in 1970, the railway was no longer flanked at both ends by narrow-gauge lines and an all-through service, called the Indian Pacific, was started. Although passengers no longer had to move to different carriages at change-of-gauge localities, Commonwealth Railways remained responsible for the service where it operated between Port Pirie and Kalgoorlie, with its crews and locomotives taking over at those stations. In 1975, Commonwealth Railways was absorbed into an enlarged federal government corporation, Australian National Railways Commission, branded as Australian National Railways and later as \\"AN\\", which continued to operate the Trans Australian.\\"Interstate cutbacks\\" Railway Digest July 1991 page 231 In 1993, Australian National took over operation of the entire coast-to-coast service following agreement with the governments of Western Australia and New South Wales.\\"IP to come under sole control of AN\\" Railway Digest March 1992 In 1997 the Indian Pacific was sold to a company, Great Southern Rail (as of 2020 trading as \\"Journey Beyond\\"), following the privatisation of Australian National.Great Southern Railway Consortium completes acquisition of Australian National Railways Passenger Business Serco Group plc 31 October 1997 , the Indian Pacific is an all-through weekly service.Indian Pacific Timetables 2016-2017 Great Southern Rail From the start of construction until 1996, the Tea and Sugar supply train carried vital provisions to the work sites and localities, all of them isolated, along the route: a butcher and banking and postal services were among the services on board. Terrain The line's distance as constructed was , slightly less than the original survey. The railway includes the longest stretch of straight track in the world. A Commonwealth Railways map marks the western end as 793 miles from Port Augusta, between Loongana and Nurina, and states: \\"The 'Long Straight' extends from this point for a distance of 297 miles and terminates at the 496 miles [sic] between Ooldea and Watson.\\" According to former astronaut Andy Thomas, the line is identifiable from space because of its unnatural straightness: \\"It's a very fine line, it's like someone has drawn a very fine pencil line across the desert\\". At no point along the route does the line cross a permanent fresh watercourse. Bores and reservoirs were established at intervals, but the water was often brackish and unsuitable for steam locomotive use, let alone human consumption, so water supplies had to be carried on the train. In the days of steam locomotion, about half the total load was water for the engine. In later years, condenser plants were built at several major stations. Names of stopping places A map on one side of a leaflet provided to passengers showing all localities on the Trans-Australian Railway at the time and the origins of their names (click to enlarge) Reflecting the line's ownership by the Commonwealth Government, eight of the localities were named (or renamed) after Australian Prime Ministers. Other prominent people's names were also allocated, as shown on the adjacent map. Operations The Trans-Australian proceeding from Port Pirie Junction to Port Augusta and Western Australia in 1938, soon after the Trans- Australian Railway was extended to Port Pirie In 1986 the Trans-Australian at Rawlinna, WA is bound for Port Pirie. It will be another 18 years before all mainland state capitals are connected by standard gauge tracks. Because of the inevitable problems of finding suitable water for steam locomotives in a desert, the original engineer, Henry Deane envisaged diesel locomotives for the line and made inquiries with potential manufacturers, although the technology was not well developed at the time. Unfortunately, a scandal involving the supply of sleepers led to Deane's resignation before the proposal had advanced. Initially trains were hauled by G class locomotives and from 1938 by C class locomotives, both steam. From 1951, diesel-electric locomotives hauled passenger services, using the new GM class locomotives.New Train Service Across Australia The West Australian 12 November 1951 The railway originally had -long crossing loops (passing sidings) every or so. As traffic increased the number of crossing loops increased. To handle longer trains, crossing loops were lengthened so that in 2008 they were all at least long and spaced about to apart. Most crossing loops are unattended and train crew operate the turnouts as required. Crossing loops have self-restoring points, so that points are reset to the straight route when a train departs from a crossing loop. The loops are fitted with radio controls so that train crew can set the points as they approach. Locomotive cabs are fitted with an activated points system (ICAPS) to set the required route without having to stop the train. Safeworking is by train orders, using verbal communication.

(retrieved 6 Feb 2009) After the Indian Removal Act of 1830 passed, another Shawnee band relocated to Indian Territory in July 1831. The final band, who would become the Shawnee Tribe, relocated to Kansas in August 1831. Their Kansas lands were drastically reduced in 1854 and broken up into individual allotments in 1858. During the Civil War many of the Shawnee Tribe fought for the Union, which inspired the name, \\"Loyal Shawnee.\\" Instead of receiving compensation or honors for their service, they returned to their Kansas lands, only to find much of it taken over by non-Indian homesteaders. Settlers were granted of Shawnee land, while remained to for the tribe, of which were granted to the Absentee Shawnee. In 1861 Kansas became a state, and the White people of Kansas demanded that all Indian tribes must be removed from the state. The Loyal Shawnee made an agreement with the Cherokee Nation in 1869, allowing 722 to gain citizenship within the Cherokee tribe and receive allotments of Cherokee land. They predominantly settled in what is now Craig and Rogers County, Oklahoma. They became known as the \\"Cherokee Shawnee,\\" primarily settling in the areas of Bird Creek (now known as Sperry); Hudson Creek (now known as Fairland); and White Oak. The Shawnee Reservation in Kansas was never legally dissolved and some Shawnee families still hold their allotment lands in Kansas. Beginning in the 1980s, the Shawnee Tribe began an effort to regain their own tribal status, independent of the Cherokee Nation.

During the 13th century Prussian Crusade, the area was conquered by the Teutonic Knights. To protect Samland from the Nadruvians and Scalvians, the crusaders built a wooden fort between the Deime and Pregel Rivers in 1283‚Äì1290. This was replaced by Tapiau Castle, a stone Ordensburg, in 1351. The settlement gradually became known by the German crusaders as Tapiau. Vytautas, the later Grand Duke of Lithuania, was baptized in Tapiau in 1385. Upon the request of the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation in 1454 Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon incorporated the region and town to the Kingdom of PolandKarol G√≥rski, ZwiƒÖzek Pruski i poddanie siƒô Prus Polsce: zbi√≥r tekst√≥w ≈∫r√≥d≈Çowych, Instytut Zachodni, Pozna≈Ñ, 1949, p.

The Tapiau Castle was often used as a second residence of the Prussian dukes; Albert of Prussia died there in 1568. It became a part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701, receiving town privileges from King Frederick William I of Prussia in 1722. It became a part of the newly established Prussian Province of East Prussia in 1773 and was administered in Landkreis Wehlau (1818‚Äì1945). Tapiau became a part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany in 1871. In August 1939, the Germans imprisoned the principal, teachers, other staff and 162 students of the Polish gymnasium in Kwidzyn in the town.Miros≈Çaw Cyga≈Ñski, Hitlerowskie prze≈õladowania przyw√≥dc√≥w i aktywu ZwiƒÖzk√≥w Polak√≥w w Niemczech w latach 1939 - 1945, \\"PrzeglƒÖd Zachodni\\", nr 4, 1984, p. 41 (in Polish) They were held in the former psychiatric hospital. In September 1939, during the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, it was converted into a prisoner-of-war camp for Polish POWs, and Polish teachers and youth were deported elsewhere. Later on, students under the age of 18 were released, older students were forcibly conscripted to the Wehrmacht, while teachers and staff were deported to Nazi concentration camps, where most of them were murdered.Cyga≈Ñski, p. 43 Also a Nazi prison for women was operated in the town. Unlike most other towns in northern East Prussia, Tapiau was largely undamaged during World War II. Following the war's end in 1945, it was annexed by the Soviet Union and renamed Gvardeysk (\\"guard town\\") in 1946. The town's German population of more than 9,000 either fled or were killed during the war, and those remaining after the war were expelled and gradually replaced by Soviet residents.

History The city was founded on 14 December of 1570 by Captain Francisco Fern√°ndez de Contreras, as part of the third populating project of the east, patronised by the Audiencia y Cabildo de Pamplona. The objective of the foundation was the opening of a route which would connect the urban centre Pamplona with the Caribbean Sea and the centre of the new kingdom. Given the geographic location of the settlement, the Audiencia de Santaf√©, presided over by Andr√©s D√≠az Venero de Leiva, decided that the new town would fall under the jurisdiction of the province of Santa Maria, the governor of which was, at the time, Don Pedro Fern√°ndez del Busto. The name Oca√±a was given to the new town to honour Fern√°ndez del Busto, who was born in Oca√±a, Spain. The native peoples in the region were those traditionally called Hacaritamas and those called Cultura Mosquito (Mosquito Culture) or Bajomagdalenense. Geography and climate # Location: .

It is located on the extreme north of the tableland known as the Mesa de Oca√±a, and has a station on the railway from Aranjuez to Cuenca.  Toponymy  The term Oca√±a seems to have the base word olca- that originates from the Celtiberian 'fertile ground, meadow', and could have evolved into: Olcania > Ocania < Oca√±a. There are other theories, like the one by Nieto Ballester, who states that Oca√±a is a pre-Roman term, maybe Indo-European, but not Celtic. On the other hand, Men√©ndez Pidal quotes the name of Oca√±a to support his thesis of the Ligurian substratum in the Iberian Peninsula.  Geography  This town is located on the north side of the plain known as Mesa de Oca√±a, where you can find many towns of the region. It is close to other towns and cities as Aranjuez in the northeast, Ont√≠gola in the north, Noblejas in the east, Villatobas in the southeast, Dosbarrios, Caba√±as de Yepes and Huerta de Valdecar√°banos in the south and Yepes and Ciruelos in the west. History The town is surrounded by ruined walls which contain the remains of an old castle. Oca√±a is the Vicus Cuminarius of the Romans. The Battle of Oca√±a was fought near here, on 19 November 1809; the Spanish under Juan Carlos de Ar√©izaga were routed by the French under Joseph Bonaparte and Marshal Soult.

Disney Software published the game. It is a spin-off of the 1988 Disney/Amblin film, Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Plot The game follows the same basic pattern of the cartoon at the beginning of Who Framed Roger Rabbit and related shorts. After opening with a Maroon Cartoons title card, Mommy explains to Roger that (once again) he is in charge of babysitting Baby Herman, and if he proves incompetent at this task, \\"he's going back to the science lab!\\". Roger swears to perform faithfully, but immediately after Mommy's departure, Baby Herman catches sight of the large baby-bottle-shaped sign on top of a local bottling plant. He escapes the house, heading for the plant, so that Roger has to find his way out of the house, and up onto the roof of the plant, before Mommy arrives home and discovers Baby Herman missing. At the end of the game (whether successful or not) Roger must face Mommy and ultimately his director on the cartoon set. Jessica Rabbit makes brief cameos in a couple of the environments. Gameplay The player moves Roger around in each room, interacting with objects‚Äîfor example, turning on a stove, pushing a bouncy cushion to a different position, etc. Once the correct objects are in the correct states they form a convoluted, Rube Goldberg-like method of exiting the room. The game is extremely challenging due to not only the puzzles themselves, but the time limit imposed by Mommy's impending return \\"one hour\\" from the start of the game. As a result, the player has much less time to learn the later environments, and a winning game requires almost flawless completion of each room's puzzle. A few hidden power-ups allow the player to turn back the clock a few minutes, but they generally take a little extra time to obtain, so remembering which are actually worth the trouble is crucial. The game's running speed varies with processor speed. At high speed, the game becomes unplayable, especially when accompanying sound effects prevent Roger's actions from speeding up at the same rate. For this reason, the game provides a setup option to deliberately run the game more slowly.

He composed numerous works, including several film scores, the regional anthem of the Turkmen SSR (which was used in the 1990s as the Turkmen national anthem), and the current national anthem of Turkmenistan. He was awarded the title of People's Artist of the USSR in 1965, the Stalin Prize in 1951 and 1952, and the Order of Lenin twice. He was also twice a member of the Supreme Soviet.  Biography  Mukhatov studied music from 1929 to 1933 at a boarding school in Ashgabat. Beginning in 1936 he began studies in the Turkmen Department of the Moscow Conservatory. His most prominent works include the opera \\"End of the Bloody Watershed\\", the symphonic poem \\"My Homeland\\", the symphony \\"In Memory of Magtymguly\\", and his 1944 composition of the national anthem of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic. Mukhatov's studies were interrupted in 1941 by the outbreak of World War II in the Soviet Union. Mukhatov returned to Ashgabat and joined the Red Army, assigned to the 99th Rifle Division, which saw combat in the Don River basin. He was demobilized in 1943 and returned to Ashgabat to the position of choir director of the Opera and Ballet Theater. This period was marked by composition of a series of patriotic songs.

In origin, it is a Bon dance that is performed by young people of each community during the Bon festival to honor the spirits of their ancestors. It underwent drastic changes in the 20th century and is today seen as a vital part of Okinawan culture.  Popular style  Modern eisa is danced by 20 to 30 young men and women, mainly in doubled lines or circles to the accompaniment of singing, chanting, and drumming by the dancers as well as by folk songs played on the sanshin. Three types of drums are used in various combinations, depending upon regional style: the , a large barrel drum; the , a medium-sized drum similar to ones used in Noh theatre; and the paarankuu (), a small hand drum similar to ones used in Buddhist ceremony. The dancers also sometimes play small hand gongs and yotsutake castanets. Eisa dancers wear various costumes, usually according to local tradition and gender of the dancer; modern costumes are often brightly colored and feature a characteristic, colorful knotted turban. Special vests, leggings, and shoes are also popular.  History  = Origin = The origin of Eisa is unclear, like for many other folk performing arts. Iha Fuy≈´ argued that the name of Eisa was related to wesa omoro (), a phrase appearing in Volume 14 of the Omoro S≈çshi (16th‚Äì17th centuries). This theory is no longer supported. It is more likely that the name derived from an exclamation used in the original song of Eisa, the \\"Mamauya Ninbuchi\\" (). The standardization of the written form was relatively new. Meiji era newspaper articles used various forms including yensaa (), yaisaa (), and ensaa (). The core of Eisa consists of nembutsu songs. The Ry≈´ky≈´-koku yuraiki (1713) attributes the introduction of nembutsu to Taich≈´ (1552‚Äì1639), a J≈çdo sect monk from Mutsu Province. According to the record, he translated Buddhist teaching into the vernacular speech and taught it to the people of Naha during the reign of Sh≈ç Nei. Other sources confirm that Taich≈´ stayed in the capital region for three years in the early 1600s and converted the king and other high-ranking officials. Some researchers speculate that he introduced odori nembutsu or dancing nembutsu to Naha. However, Taich≈´'s teaching did not prevail; it was barely carried on by his followers in Kakinohana, Naha. Another important factor related to the origin of Eisa is Chondaraa (), a group of puppeteers. The Ry≈´ky≈´-koku yuraiki records two theories regarding the etymology of Chondaraa. One is that it indicates their origin, Kyoto. The other is that its founder was named Ky≈ç (no) Kotar≈ç (‰∫¨Â∞èÂ§™ÈÉé). The fact that their origin had been obscured by the early 18th century suggests that they came from mainland Japan a long time ago. Based on modern-day Shuri Kubagawa- ch≈ç (part of the capital Shuri), they performed puppet plays, chanted Banzei (manzai) on celebratory occasions and sang nembutsu songs as a funeral service. For these reasons, they were also called Ninbuchaa (nembutsu prayer) or Yanzayaa (banzei chanter). It is uncertain if the Chondaraa performed nembutsu from the very beginning or learned later from a different group. Unlike Taich≈´'s followers, they wandered around Okinawa Island. The spread of nembutsu from mainland Japan was not limited to Okinawa. In the Yaeyama Islands, Bon dance is usually called Angama and is accompanied with nembutsu songs. The Amami Islands also have nembutsu songs, but at least some of them may belong to a tradition different from Okinawa's Chondaraa. Note that these traditions are not identified with Eisa. Eisa is considered specific to the Okinawa Islands. = Pre-World War II traditions = It is not clear when nembutsu songs spread to central Okinawa, which later played a central role in transforming Eisa. According to an oral tradition, Eisa was introduced to Kamiyama, Ginowan in the Meiji period, when a wealthy farmer invited performers from Shuri and made them teach Bon dance to young villagers. The community of Ganeko, Ginowan has a similar oral history. It appears that Eisa spread to northern Okinawa from the late Meiji period to the early Sh≈çwa period. Several communities in northern Okinawa believe that Eisa was introduced from Sesoko, Motobu, a supplying center of seasonal workers. In modern Okinawa, Eisa has gradually changed itself into popular entertainment by incorporating non-Buddhist folk songs and by adding visually appealing choreography although the Eisa dance still began with nembutsu songs such as \\"Mamauya Ninbuchi\\", \\"Ch≈çja nu Nagari\\" (), and . It has also developed regional variants. Kobayashi Yukio, a researcher of Okinawan folk songs, classified various forms of Eisa into four groups: # Taiko Eisa: mainly performed in central Okinawa. A parade is led by male drummers and is followed by female or mixed dancers. A dozen songs are performed in a mid-tempo. # Paarankuu Eisa: distributed in Uruma of midwestern Okinawa. A parade led by hand drummers and followed by a mixed group of men and women. A dozen songs are performed in an unhurried tempo. # Drumless Eisa: typical of the Motobu Peninsula (Nago, Motobu and Nakijin) in northern Okinawa. Men and women line up in a circle around a wooden scaffold where sanshin is played. Dancers use no drum. A dozen to twenty songs are performed in a fast tempo. # Female Eisa: distributed in the northern end of Okinawa. A dozen to twenty songs with varying tempo are performed solely by women. Kobayashi Yukio analyzes modern Eisa as a result of the effort by each community's newly organized youth associations, an influence from sophisticated theatrical performance of Naha, and a social movement of modernization that forced young people to turn from \\"sexually explicit\\" gatherings to the \\"healthy\\" dance. Eisa was to be performed at the Bon Festival. It is not known when it extended to other occasions. Newspaper articles confirm that Eisa, together with other folk performing arts, had been performed as an attraction at various government-sponsored exhibitions in central Okinawa already in 1900s. = Post-World War II transformation = Eisa underwent drastic changes in post-World War II Okinawa. In 1956, then under U.S. occupation, the first Zent≈ç Eisa Contest was held in Koza (part of the modern-day Okinawa City). It was originally an effort to recover from the great damage to the base-dependent commercial city caused by the \\"Off Limits\\" ordinance by the U.S. military. As a contest, participating groups were judged by screening criteria such as costumes, formation, technique, the number of performers, and innovativeness. Folklorist Kumada Susumu noted values imposed by the criteria. They clearly emphasized group dynamics, although earlier groups were not necessarily large. Contrary to today's perception of Eisa as Okinawa's tradition, they did encourage the creative nature of Eisa. In fact it was not uncommon to wear Western clothing during the performance. Another major event, the \\"Youth Furusato Eisa Festival,\\" began in Naha in 1964, originally under the name of \\"All Okinawa Seinen Eisa Contest.\\" At first, both events were competitive. In 1975, the latter abolished the contest and changed itself into a non-competitive festival, which was followed by the former in 1977. One reason behind the change was that some youth associations started showing their dissatisfaction at values imposed by the contests. Eisa had changed itself into spectacular group dynamics that was to fascinate the audience. To give the performance more punch, participating groups adopted an increasingly large number of drums. The adoption of luxurious uniforms was another effort to win the contest. A theme park, Ryukyu Village, is created showcasing traditional Ryukyuan attire and the daily work of weaving cloth, grinding sugar cane, and performance of the Eisa dance. = Creative Eisa = The 1980s saw the beginning of a new style of Eisa, called \\"creative Eisa\\" or \\"club team Eisa,\\" which holds many distinctions from traditional forms of Eisa. Whereas traditionally Eisa groups consist of people from a village or community due to the sacredness of the activity in honoring the ancestors of a specific community, creative Eisa teams are usually independent of local communities, and admit anyone regardless of their heritage. Creative Eisa is characterized largely by its song selection, with groups usually choosing to dance to newer songs, rather than the traditional standards. Hidekatsu, a Taketomi-born Ryukyu music artist, has become one of the most popular artists that creative Eisa groups dance to. His hit song, Mirukumunari, has become one of the most frequently performed creative Eisa dances. Hidekatsu is unique in that his songs are almost entirely sung in the Ryukyu languages, which is a marked departure from most modern day Ryukyu pop singers, who sing primarily in Japanese, making Hidekatsu's music a vital link for young modern Ryukyuans to the languages of their ancestors, who otherwise receive little exposure to the languages. All of the Ryukyu languages are endangered due to over a century of social and political prejudice against the Ryukyu languages by the Japanese government. Some examples of creative Eisa clubs include Ryukyukoku Matsuri Daiko and Chinagu Eisa (based in Hawai ªi). Ryukyukoku Matsuri Daiko, formed in 1982, was one of the first creative Eisa clubs, and has since expanded to form chapters in mainland Japan, Hawai ªi, the mainland United States, and other locations with Okinawan populations. Whereas traditionally men would dance Eisa utilizing drums, while women would dance drumless, creative Eisa features many females who choose to dance with drums. In addition to having the freedom of dancing to new songs, creative Eisa groups often create their own choreographies, typically using elements of traditional Eisa and ti (karate). Since its formation, creative Eisa has been hugely popular in Okinawa, and has also been exported to the Miyako and Yaeyama Islands, Yoron Island (1992) Okinoerabu Island (1993), Kagoshima Prefecture, and to the Kant≈ç and Kansai regions, where people of Okinawan descent concentrated. Creative Eisa has also been exported internationally to virtually anywhere with sizeable Okinawan populations, such as Hawai'i, the continental United States, and South America. For many young Ryukyuans in the 21st century, creative Eisa has become an integral part of their cultural identity, providing a vital link between tradition and modern creativity. One consequence of the rise of creative Eisa is a crisis in authenticity. In response, youth associations increasingly see their community-based Eisa as Okinawan tradition although the perceived tradition is a result of \\"growing pains\\" up to 1970s.

The clan is directly descended from Jacobo Z√≥bel y Zangroniz (1842-1896) and Trinidad de Ayala (1856-1918). Ayala y Compa√±√≠a (established in 1876) traces its origins to Casa R√≥xas, a business partnership established in 1834 between Domingo R√≥xas (1792-1843) and Antonio de Ayala (1803-1876). History =Jacobo Z√≥bel (1842-1896)= Jacobo Z√≥bel y Zangroniz was the son of Jakob Hinsch Z√≥bel and Ana Maria Zangroniz (daughter of a justice at the Real Audiencia of Manila, who had come from an old family in Navarra, Spain). He was born on October 12, 1842 and was the first Z√≥bel born in the Philippines. His grandfather, Johannes Andreas Z√≥bel, arrived in the Philippines from Hamburg, Germany in 1832, together with his wife, Cornelia Hinsch, and their son, Jakob. Johannes Andreas Z√≥bel came from a long line of German pharmacists and established the Botica Z√≥bel pharmacy in 1834, located in 28 Calle Real in Intramuros. Z√≥bel was sent to Hamburg, Germany for his primary education (1848 to 1859) and continued his higher studies at the Universidad Central de Madrid, taking up natural sciences. It was there he explored his lifelong fascination with medicine, chemistry and archaeology. In doing so, he mastered eleven languages. He befriended the young numismatist Don Antonio Delgado (1805-1879) from Madrid, who inspired his scholarship on antiquarian coins. He traveled to several museums in Europe to research more about his collecting hobby and he published the classic monograph titled \\"Memoria Sobre Las Monedas Libiofenicias o Teudetanas\\" which is still published and used in Spanish universities to this day. He graduated from the university in 1864 and returned to Manila to assume management of Botica Z√≥bel. Brought up as a liberal, Z√≥bel welcomed his appointment by Governor General Carlos de la Torre as a member of the Manila Municipal Board and the Sociedad Econ√≥mica de los Amigos del Pa√≠s. During his term, Z√≥bel introduced many liberal reforms: public schools, the first tree- planting activities and campaigned for representation in the Spanish Cortes. He also opened the first public reading room and library during his term. Because of his many liberal ideas, he became suspect following the Cavite Mutiny of 1872. On September 22, 1874, he was imprisoned in Fort Santiago for several months on the charge of sedition. He was cited also for possession of firearms and revolutionary pamphlets. The Prince of Bismarck made representations to the Spanish government to have him released. Z√≥bel married Trinidad de Ayala (1856-1918) on February 5, 1875. The couple took a whirlwind honeymoon trip to Japan, San Francisco, the World‚Äôs Fair of 1876, and Europe, where their children were born. The couple decided to live briefly in Spain after Jacobo decided to study transportation systems in Europe, and he renewed his numismatic research, publishing a major work entitled \\"Estudio Hist√≥rico de la Moneda Antigua Espa√±ola Desde Su Origen Hasta El Imperio Romano\\" in 1878. Sometime in 1880, the couple returned to Manila. He became a representative of Eiffel et Cie of Paris and built the Ayala Bridge in Manila. Ayala y Compa√±ia (the successor-in-interest to Casa R√≥xas) was established in 1876 and Z√≥bel became one of its partners until 1891. He was appointed member of the Consejo de Administraci√≥n by the King of Spain on May 25, 1882. He was also member of the Sociedad Econ√≥mica de los Amigos del Pa√≠s, a conciliario (adviser) of Banco Espa√±ol Filipino and the secretary of the C√°mara de Comercio de Manila. He became a member of the prestigious Real Academia de la Historia from 1865 to 1896. He received numerous awards, including the Gran Cruz de la Real Orden Americana de Isabel la Catolica in 1880, the Caballero de la Orden de Carlos III, and knight-commander of the Order of the Northern Star of Sweden and Norway. On December 1885, Z√≥bel established the first tram system in Manila, the Manila-Tondo line, which extended to Malabon and was powered by steam. His capitalist partner was the Spanish banker Don Adolfo Bayo and his local partner was one of the richest Filipinos of the time, Don Gonzalo Tuason. Eventually, he built four other major tram lines in Manila and its vicinity (Malate, Sampaloc to Tondo), drawn by horses. Z√≥bel died on October 7, 1896, while under suspicion once again of supporting the Philippine revolution. =Trinidad de Ayala (1856-1918)= Trinidad de Ayala was the youngest daughter of Antonio de Ayala and Margarita R√≥xas (the eldest child of Domingo R√≥xas y Ureta). She was very supportive of her husband's liberal causes, a trait she inherited from her mother. She was very much interested in the arts and she cultivated singing. La Ilustraci√≥n Filipina magazine reported on March 28, 1892 that she was invited to sing in Malaca√±ang with other sopranos of the period. In 1898, upon the death of her husband and with her brother-in-law, Pedro Pablo R√≥xas (1847-1913), away in Paris, France, Ayala divested her husband's tramcar and pharmacy businesses, and various assets of Ayala y Compa√±ia. Showing extreme astuteness, she redeployed capital into marketable securities in hotels and trade, which later boomed after the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War and World War I. She increased the family‚Äôs holdings in Banco Espa√±ol Filipino, bought into The Hong Kong & Shanghai Banking Company Ltd. and invested in Hong Kong real estate. Under her stewardship, Banco Espa√±ol Filipino expanded into branch banking, opening an office in Iloilo City. She funded the development of Manila's first community water system, known as the Carriedo waterworks. In 1898, she led Ayala y Compa√±√≠a into its first real estate development. Upon the death of her brother-in-law Pedro Pablo R√≥xas in 1912, she took over his interests in Ayala y Compa√±ia. In 1914, she gave Hacienda San Pedro de Macati to her grandchildren ‚Äì Jacobo Z√≥bel, Alfonso Z√≥bel and Mercedes Z√≥bel (the children of her son Enrique with his first wife, Consuelo). She died in 1918 at the age of 62. Descendants Jacobo Z. Zobel and Trinidad R. Ayala-Zobel had five children ‚Äì Fernando Antonio A. Zobel (1876-1949); twins, Enrique (1877-1943) and Alfonso (1877-1882); Margarita (1881-1963) and Gloria ‚Äì who were the first-generation Z√≥bel de Ayalas. Among the children, Fernando Antonio and Enrique would assume leadership of Ayala y Compa√±√≠a. Enrique‚Äôs descendants would inherit Ayala y Compa√±√≠a after his death in 1943. After the end of World War II, the family‚Äôs fortunes would increase with the development of Hacienda San Pedro de Macati. In 1968, Ayala y Compa√±√≠a shifted from a partnership to a corporation, becoming Ayala Corporation. Bloodline *Domingo R√≥xas (1792-1843) m. Maria Saturnina Ubaldo ** Margarita R√≥xas (1826-1869) m.

The film was based on the series of children's stories of the same name by Hugh Lofting, but used no material from any of the novels; the main connection is the name and a doctor who can speak to animals, although the pushmi-pullyu, a much-loved feature of the books, notably makes a very brief appearance in a couple of scenes. The first novel, The Story of Doctor Dolittle (1920) had originally and previously been filmed in 1967 as a musical of the same name, which was a closer (albeit still very loose) adaptation of the book. The 1967 film was a box office bomb, but became a cult classic, while the 1998 version of the film was a box office success, and was received warmly by audiences who praised its humor and thematic profundity. It has become a cult classic in recent years due to Murphy's performance, despite receiving mixed reviews from film critics upon release. The film's success generated one theatrical sequel, Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001), and three spin-offs: Dr. Dolittle 3 (2006), Dr. Dolittle: Tail to the Chief (2008), and Dr. Dolittle: Million Dollar Mutts (2009), all being direct- to-video. Plot In 1968, 5-year old John Dolittle displays an ability to talk to and understand animals, starting with his own dog. John asks his dog questions like: \\"Why do dogs sniff each other's butts?\\"; the dog's response is that it's their own way of shaking hands and he does it when meeting his new principal. However, his behavior distracts his father, Archer. Archer hires a local priest to perform an exorcism on John in order to remove the \\"devil\\" from him, but during the exam, the dog bites and attacks the man, therefore resulting in Archer sending the dog away. Following this ordeal, John eventually stops talking to animals. Thirty years later in 1998, John becomes a doctor and a surgeon, while living in San Francisco, California. He is happily married to his wife Lisa, and has two daughters, typical teenager Charisse, and nerdy Maya, who has a pet guinea pig named Rodney, and what she believes is a swan egg, which she hopes will bond with her upon hatching. A large medical company owned by Mr. Calloway seeks to buy John's practice, a deal in which one of his colleagues, Dr. Mark Weller, is enthusiastic about. Their other colleague, Dr. Gene Reiss, is skeptical about the deal due to the potential of downsizing patients and staff. John's family goes on vacation, but he goes back to work to see a patient, and then pick up Rodney. Unfortunately, on his way home, he accidentally nearly hits a dog with his SUV, causing the dog to shout at him in anger. Afterwards, Rodney starts talking to John, causing him to believe he is having a mental breakdown. John has a CT scan after animals start asking for favors when he helps a wounded owl, and he then unwittingly adopts the dog he ran over, eventually naming him Lucky. John starts secretly helping various animals, including a suicidal circus tiger named Jake, who suffers great cerebral vein. Through all this, John begins learning to re-appreciate his gift, at one point confiding to both Lucky and Mark that he has never felt excited about his work in years. However, Lisa and Mark catch him performing CPR on a rat, and have him sectioned in a mental hospital. Believing his gift is a hindrance, John rejects all abnormality in his life and returns to work, but in doing so, ostracizes Maya as well, who comes to believe he doesn't like her. Maya admits to Archer that she liked the idea of her father talking to animals. However, John has a change of heart when he eavesdrops on the conversation. He admits to Maya that he does like her for who she is, and encourages her to continue being what she wants to be. John then apologizes to Lucky, and together, they steal Jake from the circus to perform surgery on him. Mark and Gene catch John, but Gene is sympathetic of the former's opportunistic attitude. Archer reveals to Lisa that John's gift is real, encouraging her to venture into the operating theatre and keep Jake calm while John and Gene remove the cause of pain, saving Jake's life. John becomes both a doctor and a veterinarian afterwards, embracing his ability to talk to animals. The film ends with Maya's egg hatching and revealing to be a baby alligator.

Ghosh-Schellhorn, Martina & Alexander, Vera), page 116, LIT Verlag Berlin- Hamburg-M√ºnster, 2006, Neologism \\"ABCD\\" or \\"American-Born Confused Desi\\" has become a polarizing factor in the South Asian diaspora in the US, with first-generation immigrant parents and young South Asians of second or later generations.Airriess, Christopher A., Contemporary Ethnic Geographies in America, page 287, Rowman & Littlefield, 2007, Though the term was originally coined in reference to Indian-Americans, it has been adopted by the South Asian community at large. The term \\"desi\\" comes from the word \\"des\\" (homeland) in Hindi. The word has its origin in Sanskrit \\"desh\\". It's pronounced as \\"desh\\" in Bengali language (Bangla) too. \\"Desi\\" means \\"of the homeland\\" and denotes anything or anyone from South Asia. The term has been commonly known since at least the 1980s. The term \\"confused\\" is used to describe the psychological state of many second-generation South Asian Americans who struggle to balance values and traditions taught at home with attitudes and practices that are more conducive to the majority white culture. The longer and lesser known form \\"American Born Confused Desi, Emigrated From Gujarat, House In Jersey\\" is also occasionally seen; playing on the alphabet theme, it has been expanded for K-Z variously as \\"Kids Learning Medicine, Now Owning Property, Quite Reasonable Salary, Two Uncles Visiting, White Xenophobia, Yet Zestful\\" or \\"Keeping Lotsa Motels, Named Omkarnath Patel, Quickly Reaching Success Through Underhanded Vicious Ways, Xenophobic Yet Zestful\\". The former version of the A‚ÄîZ expansion was proposed by South Asian immigrants as a reaction to the latter version that derogated them.Mitra Kalita, S., Suburban Sahibs, page 13, Rutgers University Press, 2005, \\"Confused Americanized Desi (CAD)\\" is a related term, which refers to people of South Asian origin who are both born and living in the subcontinent but tend to follow western lifestyle and values. Coconuts is also a term used which basically refers to people who are \\"white from the inside and brown from the outside\\". Cultural implications Among South Asian Americans, the term may be considered divisive, as first generation South Asian Americans use it to criticize the Americanization and lack of belonging to either Indian Asian or American culture they perceive in their second-generation peers or children. Writer Vijay Prashad describes the term as \\"ponderous and overused\\" and notes it as one of the mechanisms by which new immigrants attempt to make second- generation youth feel \\"culturally inadequate and unfinished.\\". Movies The term American-Born Confused Desi first appeared in the movie American Desi (2001). ABCD: American-Born Confused Desi is a 2013 Malayalam language movie released in India. The film narrates the journey of two young American Malayalees to their motherland, Kerala, with the title based on the term \\"American-Born Confused Desi\\".

Work Vanhanen's Index of Democracy Vanhanen developed an interest in evolutionary biology after studying E. O. Wilson's sociobiology and later in his career wrote about intelligence and inequality. He supported applying evolutionary and genetic methods to social sciences. However, most of his academic work dealt with democratization, which he had studied with international comparative methods. Vanhanen was known for his Index of Democratization. In 2004, the Ombudsman of Minorities, Mikko Puumalainen, asked the police to start an investigation regarding Vanhanen's interview with a Helsingin Sanomat magazine Kuukausiliite, in which he stated that \\"Whereas the average IQ of Finns is 97, in Africa it is between 60 and 70. Differences in intelligence are the most significant factor in explaining poverty\\". The Finnish National Bureau of Investigations was considering launching a preliminary investigation on Vanhanen's speech but later decided against it, not finding that he had incited hatred against an ethnic group or committed any other crime.

After the Romans withdrew from the fortress, Mor Shlemon transformed it into a monastery in 493 AD. In 793 the monastery was renovated after a period of decline by the Bishop of Mardin and Kfartuta, Mor Hananyo, who gave the monastery its current name. The monastery was later abandoned and re-founded by the bishop of Mardin, John, who carried out important renovations and moved the see of the Syriac Orthodox Church here before his death on the 12th of July 1165.http://www.syrianchurch.org/ch/saffronmonastery.htm Therefore, From 1160 until 1932 it was the official seat of the patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church, after which it was moved first to Homs and in 1959 to Damascus.

Christoph Baumer. I. B. Tauris, New York, p. 21. The monastery has 365 rooms - one for each day of the year. This monastery is the key reason to visit Mardin. In 451, the Miaphysite congregation of the Syrian Orthodox Church (Jacobites) splits from the Byzantine Church after the Council of Chalcedon‚Äôs debate about the true nature of Christ. It served as the seat of the Syrian Orthodox church from 493 to the 1920s. The hardy Mardin Christian community has dwindled from 2000 to 200 over the past 30 years. The church still uses Aramaic, Jesus‚Äô language, as its liturgical tongue. Services are held daily, led by one of the two remaining monks. To the right of the entrance, down a few steps is a prayer room originally used as a temple to Baal in 2000 B.C. Above it is an old mausoleum formerly used as a medical school; the wooden doors are inlaid with lions and serpents. The main chapel still retains patches of its original turquoise coat and houses a 300-year-old Bible, a 1000-year-old baptismal font, and a 1600-year-old mosaic floor.https://premiumtravel.net/turkey-cities/mardin/ File:Deyrulzaferan P1030925 20080501122627.JPGThe Saffron Monastery File:Deyrulzaferan P1040066 20080501123239.JPGThe tree lined path to the monastery File:Deyrulzaferan P1040045 20080501123133.JPGThe main entrance, taken from the outer courtyard File:Deyrulzaferan P1030952 20080501122753.JPGThe inner courtyard File:Deyrulzaferan P1030983 20080424115008.JPGThe Patriarchal throne File:Zaferan.jpgClose-up picture of a column inside the monastery File:Mor Hananyo.jpgMor Hananyo Monastery, or The Saffron Monastery in English File:Bible and Pulpit, Mor Hananyo.jpgBible and Pulpit Mor Hananyo Monastery 6.jpgOutside View  Printing press  The monastery has made a great effort to print books. A printing press was bought during a journey to England in 1874 and subsequently shipped to Antonius Azar in Aleppo. in 1881 the press got moved to the Monastery and in 1882 a separate house for the press was built. In the 1880s the archbishop off Jerusalem was sent to England to learn the printing. He came back with a second press as a back up for the first, which was located in Jerusalem. In 1888 the first book was printed in the monastery and a copy of the first book was sent to the Queen Victoria. In the Monastery books kept being printed until 1917. From 1913 to 1914 also a periodical named Hikmet was printed. In the Turkish Republic the printing press was used to print official documents as it was the only press in the region.

It was made with the NScripter engine. The work was originally written in Japanese by Tomo Kataoka, and subsequently localized and translated into English, Chinese, French, Korean, Russian and Vietnamese by various fan translators. Unlike most fan translations, however, this was an authorised work. The author, however, was not actively involved in the translation process as it had been the case for True Remembrance. Both the original Japanese visual novel and its English version were released as free downloads over the Internet. The web edition of Narcissu has lower graphics and music quality, to conserve bandwidth. Narcissu is an experimental work: it uses minimalist graphics in a very narrow window, and includes two full scripts, one accompanied by a voice track, and the other adapted to work without voices. In the English translation, different translators translated each version, to provide different perspectives on the story. Synopsis The anonymous protagonist is diagnosed with lung cancer shortly after his twentieth birthday, and is admitted to hospice care at a hospital in Mito, Ibaraki. There he meets Setsumi, a woman who is two years older than he is, who is also terminally ill. Finding that they both refuse to die in the hospital or at home with their families, they run away together in a silver Honda Integra belonging to the protagonist's father. They travel west across Japan's many highways and prefectures, initially not knowing where to go, but later collectively decide on taking the narcissus fields of southern Awaji Island as a somewhat arbitrary destination. Characters ;The Protagonist :A young man, 20 years of age. Your typical university student. Attends a technical institute, and has just taken (and passed) his driver's license examination. Lives with his family‚Äîa taciturn and unsupportive mother and father and a little sister who only ever has harsh words for him. Has never really been sick in his entire life. Has never really had much of an aim for his entire life, either. :The protagonist's name is never given in the first two games, but is revealed to be in various supplementary works. ; : :A young woman, 22 years of age. Has a body physique like a child. She has a quiet personality. She loves cars and is knowledgeable about them. She expresses to the protagonist her desire to die neither at the seventh floor of the hospital nor at her home. Himeko Shinohara is the protagonist of the 2nd Side prequel. Yuka Akishima is the 23-year-old best friend of Himeko. Chihiro Shinohara is the 21-year-old younger sister of Himeko. She is a devout Christian.  Release history  The original Japanese version uses the NScripter engine; for the English localization, the open source clone ONScripter was used instead, as this has been modified to support English. Narcissu has also been ported to the Nintendo DS. A second game and a prequel named Narcissu: Side 2nd was released on May 15, 2007 while the third game in the series named Narcissu 3rd - Die Dritte Welt - was released on April 27, 2009. The final game in the series named was developed by Kadokawa Shoten playable on the PlayStation Portable. The final game is a compilation of all three games with some new extra content added. It was released on June 24, 2010. A complete remake of the Narcissu series, published by Sekai Project has been announced. It will include all of the previous Narcissu games with updated graphics and audio, as well as a new 4th Narcissu game.  Influences  Narcissu is both stylistically and thematically similar to the opening chapter of Gin'iro, a commercial title by the same writer; Tomo Kataoka himself describes it as essentially a modern-day version of Gin'iro, which is set in medieval Japan. On a level more familiar to Western audiences, the work has much in common with road movies; the screen layout is even intended to evoke a cinema screen. Many of the scenes and events of the story are road- movie clich√©s, and the ending, in which the physical journey itself is explicitly linked with the metaphorical journeys the characters have undergone (their lives, their self-discovery), is typical of the movie genre. Soundtrack Several of the music tracks in Narcissu are arrangements from other visual novels. 12 of the game's music tracks are accessible on-demand via the in-game jukebox, which is called the \\"Sound Mode\\". The titles in the following list are based on the Sound Mode of Narcissu: Side 2nd, which contains updated and corrected titles; in the original release of Narcissu, Tracks 2, 3, 7, 8 and 12 had slightly different titles, while Tracks 4 and 9 were incorrectly listed as \\"Rather Than a Life of Finality\\" and \\"Eightmoon\\" respectively. However, Narcissu: Side 2nd still mislabels the source of Track 4 as \\"The World is Coming to an W/end\\", instead of \\"The world is drawing to an W/end\\".  Print adaptations  On 25 July 2008, MF Bunko J released a light novel adaptation of Narcissu and Narcissu -side 2nd-, which was written by Tomo Kataoka himself and illustrated by GotoP. The novel is licensed in Chinese by Tong Li Publishing, and licensed in Korean by Haksan Culture Company. A manga illustrated by Pochi Edoya started serialization in the seinen manga magazine Monthly Comic Alive on 27 November 2008. Two bound volumes have been released by Media Factory under their MF Comics label, and are licensed in Chinese by Sharp Point Press.

Rhine-Neckar has a population of some 2.4 million with major cities being Mannheim, Ludwigshafen and Heidelberg. Other cities include the former Free imperial cities of Speyer and Worms. The metro area also encompasses parts of the Baden and Palatinate wine regions, the second largest vine region of the country called Deutsche Weinstra√üe and territory from the three federal states of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Rhineland- Palatinate and Hesse. It has a strong local identity as a successor of the historical Electorate of the Palatinate state. The region is named after the rivers Rhine and Neckar, which join at Mannheim. Since 2005, the region is officially recognized as a European Metropolitan Area.  Economy  The Rhine-Neckar Region is one of Germany‚Äôs driving economic forces, with global players such as BASF, SAP, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen or Fuchs Petrolub. It is also home to various SMEs. It is known as the largest technology cluster in Europe, also labeled IT-Cluster Rhine-Main-Neckar.Truffle Capital: Rhine‚ÄêMain‚ÄêNeckar cluster is ahead in Europe. (PDF; 175 kB) In 2010, regional gross value added was around EUR 67.5 billion, regional GDP over 75 billion euro. Just under 58% of the goods produced in the region are exported. The main sectors are the automotive industry, mechanical engineering and plant construction, chemicals, information technology, biotechnology and life sciences, energy and the environment and the creative and cultural industries. Rhine-Neckar has a leading position both nationally and internationally in many of these fields. More recent information shows a BIP of EUR 92.6 billion in 2015. The GDP per inhabitant is EUR 39,139; the Rhine-Neckar region is among the areas with the lowest unemployment in Germany. According to the \\"Industrie und Handelskammer\\" (IHK), there are 134,000 companies registered in the region. The Rhine-Neckar region also has high-volume purchasing power, therefore it is an attractive location for retailers and investors. Per capita income in 2008 was EUR 19,300, exceeding the national average by EUR 300.  Transportation  The Metropolitan region is a strong economic driver as well as a centre of the European transportation network. The central location and infrastructure of the region makes it accessible nationally and internationally. Individual and delivery traffic can connect to the national highway network, with highways A5/A67 and A61/A65 from north to south and the A6 from east to west, as well as the respective federal highways. Connection to Frankfurt International Airport takes 31 minutes by ICE train from Mannheim Hbf. In addition, domestic business air travel is served by Mannheim City Airport with an own local airline (Rhein-Neckar Air) and a second regional airport in Speyer. Travelling by rail also provides direct access to national major cities as well as European capitals. With around 240 long-distance departures daily at the central station, Mannheim is the second largest ICE terminal in Germany and connects the region to the European long-distance rail network. The Rhine-Neckar public transport system (VRN), with the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn as its backbone, provides infrastructure and connects to neighbouring regions. The Mannheim/Ludwigshafen harbor complex has the second-largest railway yard in Germany together with one of the largest inland ports in Europe and is a central hub for the European handling of goods. The Mannheim railway yard dispatches up to 5,300 freight cars daily.  Education  The region has a long history when it comes to the pursuit of scientific discovery as does Rhine-Neckar. In 1386, the University of Heidelberg was founded as Germany‚Äôs first university and remains one of the most prestigious universities in Germany. Around 94,000 students are enrolled at the region‚Äôs institutes of higher education, roughly one in ten of whom are international students. The 22 institutes of higher education in the Rhine-Neckar Region List of Universities in Rhine-Neckar (in German) come together with a wide range of well-known research institutions such as the European Molecular Biology Laboratory or the German Cancer Research Center to form a creative environment for innovative technologies. In the conurbation of Mannheim/Heidelberg/Ludwigshafen, more than twice as many experts work in research than the German average.

Three World Heritage Sites - Lorsch Abbey, frontiers of the Roman Empire, and the Speyer Cathedral - and more than 200 castles, cathedrals and palaces dot the history-steeped landscape, including world-famous historical sites such as Heidelberg Castle, Schwetzingen Castle and Hambach Castle. There are three nature parks (the Palatinate Forest, Neckartal-Odenwald, and the Bergstrasse-Odenwald geopark) within the region as well as four wine-growing areas (Baden, Hessische Bergstrasse, Palatinate, Rhine-Hesse). In terms of sports, the Rhine-Neckar region features professional teams like Adler Mannheim (ice hockey), Rhein- Neckar L√∂wen (handball) and SV Sandhausen and 1899 Hoffenheim (association football). Notable venues are the Golf Club St. Leon-Rot and the Hockenheimring motorsport circuit. The Olympic training centre for the Rhine- Neckar Metropolitan Region keeps local sportspeople at Olympic level. With more than 2,700 sports associations getting people moving from the Palatinate Forest to the Odenwald mountains, the region offers a broad range of non- professional sports activities. The SAP Arena built in 2005 serves as the region's most important indoor event venue. The Rhein-Neckar-Arena opened in 2009 as the new home of 1899 Hoffenheim.

Similar to wave surfing, hee h≈çlua involves the use of a narrow ( long, wide) wooden sled (papa h≈çlua). The sled is used standing up, lying down, or kneeling, to ride down man-made or naturally occurring courses (kahua h≈çlua) of rock, often reaching speeds of or greater. In the past, Hawaiian lava sledding was considered both a sport and a religious ritual for honoring the gods. Keauhou museum Sleds Papa h≈çlua are composed of a pair of runners and a superstructure (platform). The runners are made from hard native woods, traditionally that of kauila (Alphitonia ponderosa or Colubrina oppositifolia), uhiuhi (Caesalpinia kavaiensis), or mƒÅmane (Sophora chrysophylla). The runners have up-curved fore edges, straight aft edges, and rounded lower edges. Crosspieces keep the runners apart. The superstructure, two rails smaller in diameter than the runners and spaced apart by pieces of bamboo, sits on top of the crosspieces. The runners, crosspieces, and rails are bound together with sennit cordage. The rails are wrapped in white kapa cloth and the rail frame is covered in lauhala matting. Oil from kukui (Aleurites moluccana) nuts coats either the course or the runners to provide lubrication. Courses A kahua h≈çlua foundation, which is made of rocks, is built in a depression on a hillside. The foundation is covered in packed-in dirt and an outer layer of pili grass (Heteropogon contortus) or k≈ç (Saccharum officinarum) flower tassels. Courses are wide enough for a single sled and are not sloped at the bottom. A skilled rider can travel on the course, reaching the flat portion.

In 1847, the City of New York authorized the construction of railroad tracks along Tenth and Eleventh Avenues on Manhattan's West Side. The street-level tracks were used by the New York Central Railroad's freight trains, which shipped commodities such as coal, dairy products and beef. For safety the railroad hired \\"West Side cowboys\\", men who rode horses and waved flags in front of the trains. However, so many accidents occurred between freight trains and other traffic that the nickname \\"Death Avenue\\" was given to Tenth and Eleventh Avenues. In 1910, one organization estimated that there had been 548 deaths and 1,574 injuries over the years along Eleventh Avenue. Public debate about the hazard began during the early 1900s. In 1929 the city, the state, and New York Central agreed on the West Side Improvement Project, conceived by Robert Moses. The project eliminated 105 street-level railroad crossings and added to Riverside Park; it also included construction of the West Side Elevated Highway and the West Side Line elevated viaduct. It cost more than $150 million, about $2 billion in 2017 dollars. The last stretch of street-level track was removed from Eleventh Avenue in 1941.

The CCI offices are located in the Ottawa suburb of Gloucester. Mission The CCI is recognized as a pioneer and leader in the conservation of cultural heritage in Canada. The CCI supports the heritage community in preserving Canada's heritage collections so they can be accessed by current and future generations. The CCI is charged with the duty \\"to promote the proper care and perservation of Canada's moveable cultural heritage, and to advance the practice, science, and technology of conservation.\\" History The CCI originated within the National Gallery of Canada in 1957, as its Conservation and Scientific Research Division under the leadership of Dr. Nathan Stolow. In 1964, the division was granted greater autonomy and became the National Conservation Research Laboratory (\\"NCRL\\"). As a result of its success, in 1972 the NCRL was split off from the National Gallery of Canada and was renamed the Canadian Conservation Institute with Dr. Stolow as its first Director General. It now operates as an agency of the federal government of Canada, currently under the auspices of the Department of Canadian Heritage. The CCI is primarily a research organization, but provides education and services on conservation and restoration-related matters. The CCI now promotes the proper care and preservation of Canada's cultural heritage and to advance the practice, science, and technology of conservation. The Institute has worked closely with hundreds of Canadian museums, art galleries, archives, libraries, historic sites, academic institutions, and other heritage organizations to help them better preserve their collections. The primary role of CCI's clients is to acquire, conserve, research, communicate, and exhibit permanent heritage collections that are accessible to the Canadian public for purposes of study, education, and enjoyment. As a Special Operating Agency of the Department of Canadian Heritage, CCI has widened its scope of activities and now markets its services and products around the world. The CCI was included amongst other architecturally interesting and historically significant buildings in Doors Open Ottawa, held June 2, 2012.http://ottawa.ca/doorsopen Doors Open Ottawa Programs The following are but some of the services CCI provides: * Conservation research and laboratory services. * Preventative and restorative conservation. * Transportation of artifacts. * Scientific examination and analysis of museum objects and archaeological materials. * Advice on preserving a historic house or property. * Collections assessment surveys. * Advice for conservation or restoration treatment for valuable works of art. * Conservation and restoration training. CCI also provides project-specific teams for conservation, scientific, and testing projects. Its Paper Group works with archives and libraries in preserving and restoring their collections. Research conducted by the Paper Group includes paper bleaching, enzyme use, washing, and de-acidification. The CCI also self-publishes a variety of materials related to its work. As well, each year it publishes the CCI, the Journal of the Canadian Conservation Institute. With a staff of about 80 to 100, the CCI has treated more than 13,000 objects for the heritage community, has published hundreds of scientific papers, and has distributed in excess of one million publications. The Institute responds to at least 2,000 requests for assistance annually. Working together in well-equipped, fully secure, climate-controlled laboratories, conservators, chemists, engineers, biologists, and other professionals handle projects ranging from information inquiries to complex treatments and research.

The route and the area around it is a mountainous \\"theme route\\" running north‚Äìsouth along the western edge of the Odenwald forest in southern Hesse and northern Baden-W√ºrttemberg. The route passes through the Bergstra√üe administrative district, and independent viticultural regions of Hessische Bergstra√üe and Badische Bergstra√üe. Between the cities of Heidelberg and Weinheim the Upper Rhine Railway Company (OEG) tram route runs alongside. Route The route goes almost straight from north to south at the spot where the Rhine lowlands meet the western edge of the Odenwald. The name comes from the road's route along the foot of the mountains, the Rhine lowlands once being too damp to build a road there. The route mostly follows the modern B3 road. It begins in Darmstadt and, after passing through Eberstadt, splits into the \\"Old Bergstra√üe\\" and the \\"New Bergstra√üe\\", which goes somewhat further to the west. The two routes meet again at Zwingenberg. In Weinheim-L√ºtzelsachsen an old and a new Bergstra√üe once more form, the new one passing west of the old route as far as Heidelberg-Handschuhsheim, where the two meet once more. The route carrying on after the Neckar from Heidelberg to Wiesloch is still usually known as the Bergstra√üe, even though the type of country and climate typical of the Bergstra√üe is no longer as pronounced. Heppenheim The Bergstra√üe passes through three rural districts and two urban districts: Darmstadt, Landkreis Darmstadt-Dieburg, Kreis Bergstra√üe, Heidelberg and the Rhein-Neckar-Kreis. The northern part belongs to Hesse and the southern part to Baden. The border between these two L√§nder is between Heppenheim and Laudenbach. The Bergstra√üe was used as a trading route as far back as Roman times. The name bergstrasen was first recorded in 1165. A Latinised form of the name (strata montana) did not arise from the Romans but during the Renaissance. Older names are: strata publica (795), platea montium (819) and montana platea (1002). The route has changed slightly in places across the centuries. In 1955 traces of the old paved Roman road were discovered during work on the drains in Heppenheim. They were moved to the Ferdinand Feuerbach Unit (on the corner of Karlstra√üe and Karl-Marx-Stra√üe) and can still be seen there today. They cover an area of about 20 m¬≤. Places along the route Bergstra√üe The Bergstra√üe travels through the following towns (from north to south): *Darmstadt **Darmstadt **Darmstadt-Eberstadt *Seeheim-Jugenheim (Old Bergstra√üe) **Malchen **Seeheim **Jugenheim *Alsbach-H√§hnlein (Old Bergstra√üe) **Alsbach *Bickenbach (New Bergstra√üe) *Zwingenberg *Bensheim **Bensheim-Auerbach **Bensheim *Heppenheim *Laudenbach (Rhein-Neckar) *Hemsbach *Weinheim **Weinheim-Sulzbach **Weinheim **Weinheim-L√ºtzelsachsen **Weinheim-Hohensachsen *Hirschberg an der Bergstra√üe **Gro√üsachsen **Leutershausen *Schriesheim *Dossenheim *Heidelberg **Heidelberg-Handschuhsheim **Heidelberg-Neuenheim *:Neckar **Heidelberg **Heidelberg-Rohrbach *Leimen (Baden) *Nu√üloch *Wiesloch  Countryside The countryside directly along the route is also named after the road. The weather in the region is typically particularly mild and sunny, with around 1500 hours of sun every year. Spring starts earlier here than anywhere else in Germany. This and the good soil conditions (a fertile loess soil) make the Bergstra√üe one of Germany's richest fruit-producing areas, with grapes, other fruit, almonds, sweet chestnuts and walnuts. The Bergstra√üe is famous for its almond trees which thrive in the area and bloom as early as March. Other Mediterranean plants such as figs and olive trees also grow there. Because of the mild climate, Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor (1765‚Äì1790), pausing at the Bergstra√üe on a trip back from Frankfurt am Main, is said to have exclaimed \\"This is where Germany starts to become Italy\\". As part of the conurbation at the point where the Rhine, Main and Neckar rivers meet, the Bergstra√üe is highly developed and industrialised. But tourism is also of some importance there. Apart from the countryside, the most important sights are Heidelberg with its castle and old city; Darmstadt, the center of Jugendstil art, with its artists' colony; the chain of castles on the edge of the Oden forest (Castle Frankenstein, Alsbach Castle, Auerbach Castle, Starkenburg above Heppenheim, Wachenburg and Windeck above Weinheim, Strahlenburg above Schriesheim), as well as the picturesque old town centers in many cities and towns, especially the almost completely preserved (except for the city walls) town of Heppenheim with its splendid city hall, marketplace, \\"Bergstra√üe Cathedral\\", and numerous medieval half-timbered structures; and in addition the old town centers of Zwingenberg, Bensheim and Weinheim. An extraordinary sight in the immediate vicinity of the Bergstra√üe is the Carolingian-era entrance hall of the one-time Lorsch monastery, designated by UNESCO as a world cultural heritage site.  Population history The Bergstra√üe area was settled in early times. Numerous excavations have uncovered finds dating back to the times of the Linear Pottery and Corded Ware cultures, who tilled the land and herded cattle there in around 2500 to 1500 BC. The population grew in Roman times and settlements were built in different sizes, villae rusticae. These were the dominant economic units of the mountainous country along the Bergstra√üe between 120 and 260 AD.

The film was released on 22 December 1994. It is a remake of the 1972 film Fist of Fury, which starred Bruce Lee as the lead character.

Plot Chen Zhen attends class in Kyoto University when thugs from the Black Dragon Clan burst in and attempt to force him out because he is Chinese. Mitsuko, one of Chen's classmates who is in a romantic relationship with him, along with Chen's professor and classmates, defend his presence. The thugs turn violent but Chen easily defeats them using a variety of controlled Chin Na techniques. The Japanese thugs' sensei, Funakochi Fumio, who is also Mitsuko's uncle, arrives to take control of the situation and apologizes for his students' behavior. Fumio is impressed by Chen's skill and converses with him, and Chen learns that his master, Huo Yuanjia, has died after losing in a match against a Japanese karateka, Akutagawa Ryoichi. Chen is distraught after hearing the bad news and he leaves Kyoto for Shanghai immediately. Chen returns to Jingwu School and learns that his master's son, Huo Ting'en, has become the new master of Jingwu School. The next day, Chen goes to the Japanese dojo to challenge Akutagawa, who honorably accepts. Chen defeats Akutagawa easily and concludes that Akutagawa is not capable of defeating Huo Yuanjia, after which he suspects foul play in his master's death. Chen has Huo Yuanjia's corpse exhumed for an autopsy against the wishes of Huo Ting'en and his fellow Jingwu members. It is revealed that Huo Yuanjia was poisoned and weakened before his match against Akutagawa. Over the next few days, word of Chen's victory against Akutagawa spreads and Chen becomes a local celebrity in Shanghai. The Jingwu members begin to look up to Chen as their new instructor, which incurs the jealousy of Huo Ting'en. Huo remains silent and seeks comfort in a brothel, where he becomes romantically involved with a prostitute. Meanwhile, Akutagawa confronts General G≈ç Fujita of the Imperial Japanese Army after suspecting that his match against Huo Yuanjia had been rigged, which he considers dishonorable. After a heated argument, Fujita kills Akutagawa by breaking his back in front of the Japanese ambassador, and then places the blame on Chen. Enraged by their master's death, Akutagawa's students attack the Jingwu School, culminating in a fight that is eventually stopped by the local police. Chen is arrested and placed on trial for allegedly murdering Akutagawa. Several bribed witnesses provide false and conflicting accounts of the murder, but the court refuses to accept testimony from any Chinese defense witnesses on the grounds of bias towards Chen. Mitsuko shows up and testifies that Chen is innocent because he spent the night with her, and the court accepts her false testimony because she is Japanese. Chen is exonerated, but his apparent relationship with Mitsuko ruins his reputation because the Chinese view it as an act of betrayal against his fellow Chinese. Huo Ting'en and the senior Jingwu members demand that Chen leaves either Mitsuko or the school. Huo uses the opportunity to settle his personal vendetta against Chen by challenging him to a fight. Although Chen defeats Huo, he still chooses to leave with Mitsuko. Huo feels humiliated by his defeat so he gives up his position as master of Jingwu before leaving to join his lover. Jingwu's members eventually discover Huo's relationship with her and reprimand him. Huo learns his lesson and returns to Jingwu. Chen and Mitsuko faces hostility from the locals and are forced to take shelter in an abandoned hut near Huo Yuanjia's grave. At the same time, Fumio arrives from Japan, as requested by Fujita, to eliminate Chen. Fumio engages Chen in a fight, which ends in a draw and the conclusion that if Chen learns to adapt to his opponent's moves, he will be unbeatable. Fumio leaves after warning Chen about Fujita's ill intentions and brutal methods. Days later, Huo Ting'en visits Chen and apologizes for his earlier behavior, saying that Jingwu School accepts Chen and Mitsuko's relationship now. Huo teaches Chen the Mizong Fist that night while Mitsuko leaves secretly, leaving behind a message for Chen that she will wait for him in Japan. The next day, Chen and Huo confront Fujita at his dojo, where Fujita exposes a traitor from Jingwu who played a role in Huo Yuanjia's death, and shoots him. Huo Ting'en then fights Fujita, who appears to be incredibly strong and resilient, and Huo suffers grave injuries. Chen engages Fujita in a long and exhausting fight, and eventually defeats him. Just as Chen and Huo are about to leave, the enraged Fujita comes after them with a katana. Huo pushes Chen out of the katana's way but is stabbed in the arm, and Chen is forced to kill Fujita. Japanese soldiers surround them and prepare to open fire. The Japanese ambassador, who is a pacifist against rising militarism in his country, arrives and orders his soldiers to stand down. He agrees with Chen's actions as he has been aware that Fujita is a madman, but also warns them that the Japanese government will use Fujita's death as an excuse to start a war with China, unless the Chinese can account for Fujita's death by executing the murderer. Chen expresses his willingness to accept the blame for Fujita's death in order to prevent war, earning the ambassador's further admiration. Instead of ordering Chen's death, the ambassador stages a fake execution and substitutes the dead Jingwu's traitor's body for Chen's. Meanwhile, Chen secretly leaves Shanghai for Manchuria.

The style of fighting in the two films bears some resemblance. In 1996, an unofficial sequel titled Fists of Legends 2: Iron Bodyguards was released starring Jet Le (not Jet Li). Later films have also been influenced by Fist of Legend. Hitman also has a scene involving him using a belt as a weapon as seen previously. The more realistic and less wire-driven fight choreography seen in Kiss of the Dragon was a result of fan criticism to Corey Yuen's choreography in Romeo Must Die and preference for the style seen in Fist of Legend. In 2006, Jet Li played his character's teacher, Huo Yuanjia, in Fearless. In 2010, Gordon Chan and Andrew Lau produced a continuation of this film named Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen with Donnie Yen as Chen Zhen in his thirties. Box office Though Fist of Legend is widely considered one of Li's best films, during the downturn period of the Hong Kong film industry, its HK $14,785,382 box office gross was considered a disappointment. By comparison, Li's Fong Sai-yuk grossed over HK $30 million, and Fong Sai-yuk II grossed HK $23 million. However, its overall box office from other countries was good. Different versions =Miramax= The English-dubbed U.S. release by Miramax and Buena Vista Distribution contains four specific mistranslations that drastically alter the meaning of the film as a whole. # Before Chen leaves Japan, Mitsuko asks him if he hates the Japanese. In the U.S. version he replies, \\"I don't hate.\\" In the Hong Kong version he replies, \\"I don't know.\\" # In the U.S. version of the scene where Chen fights Fumio, Fumio asks him what the most effective way to defeat an enemy is. Chen replies that the most effective way is to focus one's energy and strike, and Fumio agrees with him. In the Hong Kong version, they begin by discussing their match. Chen says that the purpose of martial arts is to defeat an enemy. Fumio says, \\"No, you're wrong. The best way to defeat your enemy is to use a gun. Martial arts is about personal development.\\" # Prior to the final fight sequence in the U.S. version, Chen and Huo face Fujita who holds up a sign reading Dongya Bingfu (Êù±‰∫ûÁóÖÂ§´) and he tells them that the sign says, \\"Jingwu is closed\\". The Chinese characters are commonly translated to \\"Sick men of the East\\" and is used as a famous reference to Fist of Fury. The subtitles in the Hong Kong version translate the sign correctly. # At the end in the U.S. version, Chen's driver asks him if he will go to be with Mitsuko. Chen responds, \\"If I no longer have a country, at least I can still be with the woman I love.\\" His response in the Hong Kong version is, \\"Where is war with Japan most likely to break out?\\" The driver says, \\"Manchuria\\" and he says, \\"We'll go to Manchuria then.\\" With regard to footage, this version deletes the final moments of students training and contains a brand new set of opening (animated) and closing credits in English, abandoning the previous ones completely. =Taiwan= Compared to the Hong Kong version, the 106-minute Mandarin-dubbed Taiwanese version contains the following footage: # An extension to the scene where Fujita gives a harsh lecture to several men, prior to his order to spy on certain Japanese individuals. # An extension of the scene with Chen after bowing to his master's shrine where Liu Zhensheng then hands over a suitcase to Chen and the latter proceeds to leave. Prior to following him, Mitsuko also respectfully bows. # An entire scene where Hill Hung is looking for Huo Ting'en at a brothel, only to find him smoking opium with a prostitute. # An entire scene where Hill Hung brings tea to Huo Ting'en, the night prior to the final match. # An extension of Fumio talking with the ambassador, prior to the former winning the Renju game. # After the final fight ends, a very small extension sees the Japanese soldiers pause for a moment prior to entering the Dojo. In the Mandarin soundtracks of the film, there is background music when Chen fights Huo. However, in the Cantonese soundtrack, the music only plays after Chen performs a Capoeira-style kick later on in the fight. =Hong Kong= The Hong Kong version in return, has the following unique footage: # A reaction shot of the cook in the kitchen (followed by a shot from Huo Yuanjia's shrine) after Uncle Nong dispatches students to search for Huo Ting'en. # A few seconds of Chen Zhen feigning death to Fujita. # After the credits finish, we see the crew waving to the camera. Both Hong Kong and Taiwanese version have slightly different end credits. Media =DVD= Ritek In 1997, the first DVD was released by Ritek in Taiwan, which fans later reported to be an \\"uncut\\" version. This has been a widely held misconception - whilst this version does carry some more footage (as a Taiwanese version), it is in turn missing a few moments that the Hong Kong version has. Miramax On 15 February 2000, Miramax issued a DVD of this film in the U.S. (later in the U.K. too by Hollywood Pictures on VHS first, then DVD later on 29 March 2002). Whilst it featured better visual quality than any other release (some agree even to this day), it immediately caused an uproar with the Hong Kong Cinema fan community because it contained only a new English dub/score with alterations to the original dialogue and no original Cantonese option - a defect shared with many of their Hong Kong-acquired titles (not to mention the edits). HKVideo On 20 March 2002, the first official DVD of the Hong Kong version with a Cantonese soundtrack was issued by HKVideo in France. However, it contained no English subtitles. One notable difference to other versions carrying a Chinese/Taiwanese version is that it doesn't contain the ending text describing the aftermath of Jingwu School, but is otherwise the same and, bar a few missing frames, uncut. Maxam A lesser-known DVD was issued on 25 March 2005 by Japanese distributor Maxam which contains the Hong Kong version (and its ending text) in complete form, but no English subtitles. Dragon Dynasty A R1 2-DVD \\"Ultimate Edition\\" was finally released on 9 September 2008 from The Weinstein Company's Dragon Dynasty label in America, which features many extras and the original Cantonese soundtrack with English subtitles, marking the first official DVD release to do so. This version was also released in Australia (Region 4), in single disk. However, this is still visually the previous US version with the Cantonese soundtrack edited to fit its visuals. Matters are worsened when the subtitles revert to dubtitles towards the end - relying on the previous incorrectly transcribed \\"Sick Men Of Asia\\" sign and story-changing ending (see above) from Miramax's English dub. New Age 21/HMH German-issued DVDs from distributor 'New Age 21' (released 12 November 2008) and 'HMH' (released 20 November 2008) were released in an uncut state and contain a Cantonese soundtrack with English subtitles. Other releases Other uncut English- subtitled releases of the Hong Kong Cantonese-language versions (now OOP) include the US Tai Seng VHS (released 20 October 2000), the Australian Chinatown Video VHS, the U.K. Made in Hong Kong VHS (released 1 October 1999), and the Mei Ah VCD, VHS and LD. The Malaysian Speedy VCD also contains a similar version, but enforces cuts to some scenes for violence: # Fujita kneeing Ry≈çichi Akutagawa's back. # Huo Ting'en hitting his head on a window during the finale. # Chen Zhen hitting his head on a window during the finale. The Spanish Manga Films DVD titled El Mejor Luchador (released 24 October 2001) and a slightly edited Indian Diskovery VCD titled The Hitter: Fist of the Legend contain an English-dubbed version intended for export to English- speaking territories. Strangely, this version has aired occasionally on US TV with a Miramax ident instead of their own produced version. =Blu-ray= Cine Asia released a Blu-ray version 22 March 2010 in the UK and on 20 April 2010 in USA.

Part of the Greater Glasgow conurbation, it is located on the Auldhouse Burn about south of Glasgow city centre, and just outside the city's administrative boundaries (the closest neighbourhoods within Glasgow, to the west and north of Thornliebank, being Arden, Carnwadric, Eastwood, Jenny Lind and Mansewood). The neighbouring East Renfrewshire town of Giffnock lies directly to the east, with Rouken Glen Park to the south. The original village was founded in the 18th century and began to develop after the opening of a printworks in 1778, and subsequently other light industry. Despite industrial decline in the 20th century, Thornliebank continued to expand due to extensive public and private housing construction. As of the 2011 Census, the area has a population of 4,051. History It is not known when Thornliebank was first settled although it has been ascertained that it did not exist prior to the 18th century. The village first makes its appearance on Thomas Richardson's map of 1795 and was, at the time, referred to as 'Thorny Bank', a title believed to have been inspired by the substantial number of thorn trees that were prevalent in the area. In 1789 it was a little street of cottages but it had grown by 1845, to have a population of 1366. This was largely due to the Crum family, who established and ran the Thornliebank printworks. John Crum founded the works in Main Street in 1778 to print locally woven linen.Portal to the Past: East Renfrewshire's Heritage Collection - ThornliebankGlasgow, Thornliebank, Main Street, Thornliebank Print Works, Canmore Map of Thornliebank in the early 1900s Walter Crum who was in charge by 1819 was a chemist and Fellow of the Royal Society. He replaced spinning and weaving by calico printing with bleaching, turkey red dyeing and \\"beetling\\". This brought immigrants from Northern Ireland and the New Statistical Account of Scotland described Thornliebank as \\"a very flourishing village where, thirty years ago, three families did not exist\\". Walter's son Alexander Crum who took over the printing works was a major philanthropist supporting housing, education, and leisure facilities in the village. He also provided funds for the village club and Thornliebank Parish Church. Alexander Crum was Member of Parliament for Renfrewshire from 1880 to 1885. After his death he was commemorated by the Crum Library which was designed by the Scottish architect Sir Rowand Anderson and formally opened on 20 March 1897.Glasgow Herald 22 March 1897 Woodfarm Woodfarm is a residential area of Thornliebank, next to Rouken Glen Park and Eastwood Park. The housing is a mix of (mostly formerly) council-owned property, ex Army-owned houses, older bungalows and villas, and newer flats and family homes built within the last twenty years. Woodfarm Playing Fields sports complex was completed in 2004. The development features a full-sized football pitch, three five-a-side football pitches (that can also be used as tennis courts), and a clubhouse with changing rooms.

The song was first recorded by the French singer Roland Gerbeau in 1945. When Trenet's version was released in 1946, it became an unexpected hit, and has remained a chanson classic and jazz standard ever since. Background and history Trenet said that he had written an initial version of the song's lyrics as a poem at the age of 16, many years before he came up with a tune for it. The tune came to him while he was traveling by train in 1943 between Montpellier and Perpignan as he was gazing out of the window at the √âtang de Thau, a lagoon in the south of France. He jotted it down on a piece of paper and in the afternoon he worked out the details with his pianist L√©o Chauliac. That evening they performed it in front of an audience without much of an impact. The song was not recorded before the end of World War II. It was first offered to Suzy Solidor, who, however, declined it. After that the job fell to Roland Gerbeau, who recorded it together with Jo Bouillon's orchestra at the end of 1945. The orchestration and chorus were provided by Albert Lasry. Trenet himself recorded his song for the first time in 1946. Over the years the song turned out to be rather popular throughout the world and developed into a chanson classic and jazz standard with a large number of prominent artists recording their own versions. Besides the original in French, the song was also recorded in several other languages with the English version \\"Beyond the Sea\\" being particularly popular and becoming the signature song for the American singer Bobby Darin. In 1966 there were already over 100 different recordings of La Mer and it was considered to be France's best selling song together with Edith Piaf's \\"La Vie en rose\\". By the time of Trenet's death in 2001 there were more than 4000 different recordings of itFrench singer Trenet dies. BBC News, 2001-2-19 with over 70 million copies sold in total. Despite various translations into other languages the original French version was popular outside France and with non-French musicians as well. Trenet published his recording in the US in 1947 and Bing Crosby recorded La Mer on his 1953 album Le Bing: Song Hits of Paris. Charles Trenet's recording of 'La Mer' is choreographed in Matthew Bourne's 1989 ballet suite, Infernal Galop, \\"a French dance with English subtitles\\", in which a merman seduces three matelots. The song was also recorded by Cliff Richard. In 1976 Julio Iglesias included the song on his live album En el Olympia. The song was included on Dalida's 1999 posthumous album Besame Mucho. Demis Roussos included the song on his 1995 studio album Immortel. More recent versions include Kristina & Laura, Miguel Bos√©, Manlio Sgalambro, Lisa del Bo, Bir√©li Lagr√®ne, Patricia Kaas, Lola Dutronic, Mireille Mathieu, Chantal Chamberland and others. Instrumental versions were done by Ray Conniff His Orchestra and Chorus, Le Grand Orchestre de Paul Mauriat, Richard Clayderman, Django Reinhardt. Other languages =\\"Beyond the Sea\\"= English lyrics, unrelated to the French lyrics, were later written by Jack Lawrence and entitled \\"Beyond the Sea\\". The English version has been recorded by many artists, including Benny Goodman, Mantovani, Roger Williams and Gisele MacKenzie, but Bobby Darin's version released in 1959 is the best known by many, reaching #6 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song reached the top 40 twice prior to the Darin version (Goodman's version in 1948, Williams's in 1955).

It was performed as a jazz tune by Rob de Nijs. =\\"Das Meer\\"= The first German version was written in 1948 by Hans Fritz Beckmann und Lale Andersen.

In 1832 he built an early form of alternating current electrical generator, based on the principle of electromagnetic induction discovered by Michael Faraday. Mohamed A. El-Sharkawi, Electric Energy: An Introduction, Third Edition, CRC Press, 2015, ,page 3 Pixii's device was a spinning magnet, operated by a hand crank, where the north and south poles passed over a coil with an iron core. A current pulse was produced each time a pole passed over the coil. He also found that the current direction changed when the north pole passed over the coil after the south pole. Later, acting on a suggestion by Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re, other results were obtained by introducing a commutator which produced a pulsating direct current. At that time direct current was preferable to alternating current. Although Pixii did not fully understand electromagnetic induction, his device led to more sophisticated devices being constructed.

Cecilienhof was the last palace built by the House of Hohenzollern that ruled the Kingdom of Prussia and the German Empire until the end of World War I. It is famous for having been the location of the Potsdam Conference in 1945, in which the leaders of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States made important decisions affecting the shape of post World War II Europe and Asia. Cecilienhof has been part of the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. Location View from Neuer Garten Cecilienhof is located in the northern part of the large Neuer Garten park, close to the shore of the Jungfernsee lake. The park was laid out from 1787 at the behest of King Frederick William II of Prussia, modelled on the W√∂rlitz Park in Anhalt-Dessau. Frederick William II also had the Marmorpalais (Marble Palace) built within the Neuer Garten, the first Brandenburg palace in the Neoclassical style erected according to plans designed by Carl von Gontard and Carl Gotthard Langhans, which was finished in 1793. Other structures within the park close to Schloss Cecilienhof include an orangery, an artificial grotto ('), the \\"Gothic Library\\", and the Dairy in the New Garden, also constructed for King Frederick William II. The park was largely redesigned as an English landscape garden according to plans by Peter Joseph Lenn√© from 1816 onwards, with lines of sight to nearby Pfaueninsel, Glienicke Palace, Babelsberg Palace, and the Sacrow Church. Construction Since the Marmorpalais, which had been the traditional Potsdam residence of the Hohenzollern crown prince, had become inadequate for current tastes, Emperor Wilhelm II ordered the establishment of a fund for constructing a new palace at Potsdam for his oldest son, Crown Prince Wilhelm (William) and his wife, Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin on 19 December 1912. After their marriage in 1905, Wilhelm and Cecilie had previously lived at the Marmorpalais for most of the year and at the Berlin Kronprinzenpalais in winter. In 1911, the Crown Prince had been appointed commander of the Prussian 1. Leibhusaren- Regiment and moved to Danzig-Langfuhr. On 13 April 1914 the Imperial Ministry and the Saalecker Werkst√§tten signed a building contract that envisaged a completion date of 1 October 1915 and a construction cost of 1,498,000 Reichsmark for the new palace. The architect was Paul Schultze-Naumburg, who visited the couple in Danzig to work out the design for the palace. It was based on English Tudor style buildings, arranged around several courtyards featuring half-timbered walls, bricks and 55 different decorative chimney stacks. With the start of World War I in August 1914, construction stopped but was resumed in 1915. Architecture and interior design Crown Prince Wilhelm was so impressed with cottage and tudor style homes like Bidston Court in Birkenhead (England) that Cecilienhof was inspired by it.http://www.hiddenwirral.org/bidston-court-of- wirral/4590121505http://www.gpsmycity.com/attractions/schloss- cecilienhof-39177.html Also, due to Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin's family ties, German tudor-styled Gelbensande Manor near Rostock in Mecklenburg-Schwerin was an inspiration. The palace was designed in such a way as to be inhabitable for most of the year. Its low structure and multiple courts conceal the fact that it boasts a total of 176 rooms. Besides the large Ehrenhof (three-sided courtyard) in the centre, which was used only for the arrival and departure of the Crown Prince and his wife, there is a smaller garden court, the Prinzengarten, and three other courts around which the various wings of the building are arranged. The \\"public\\" rooms were located in the centre part on the ground floor, around a central great hall, while above on the first floor were the \\"private\\" bedroom, dressing rooms and bathrooms. The living area of the great hall also features a massive wooden stairway made of oak. This was a gift from the city of Danzig. The ground floor rooms included an area for the Crown Prince with smoking room, library and breakfast room as well as an area for his wife with music salon, writing room and a room designed like a cabin on an ocean liner. The latter was used by Cecilie as a breakfast room. Like some of the other rooms it was designed by Paul Ludwig Troost, who also designed actual interiors of ocean liners for the Norddeutscher Lloyd shipping line. History before 1945 The palace was finished in August 1917. It was named Cecilienhof after the Duchess and the couple moved in immediately. Cecilie gave birth at Cecilienhof to her youngest child, who was born on 5 September 1917. However, when the revolution erupted in November 1918, for security reasons Cecilie and her six children moved for a while to the Neues Palais, where the wife of Emperor Wilhelm II, Empress Augusta Victoria, was living. After the Empress followed her husband into exile in the Netherlands, Cecilie remained in Potsdam and returned to Cecilienhof where she lived until 1920. As the property of the Hohenzollern family had been confiscated after the revolution, Cecilie then had to move her residence to an estate at Oels in Silesia, which was a private property. Only her sons Wilhelm (William) and Louis Ferdinand remained at Cecilienhof while they attended a public Realgymnasium (school) in Potsdam. Crown Prince Wilhelm had gone into exile in the Netherlands on 13 November 1918 and was interned on the island of Wieringen. He was allowed to return to Germany‚Äîas a private citizen‚Äîon 9 November 1923. In June 1926, a referendum on expropriating the former ruling Princes of Germany without compensation failed and as a consequence, the financial situation of the Hohenzollern family improved considerably. A settlement between the state and the family made Cecilienhof property of the state but granted a right of residence to Wilhelm and Cecilie. This was limited in duration to three generations. Wilhelm subsequently broke the promise he had made to Gustav Stresemann, who allowed him to return to Germany, to stay out of politics. He supported the rise to power of Adolf Hitler, who visited Cecilienhof three times, in 1926, in 1933 (on the \\"Day of Potsdam\\") and in 1935. However, when Wilhelm realized that Hitler had no intention of restoring the monarchy, their relationship cooled. After the assassination attempt on 20 July 1944, Hitler had Wilhelm placed under supervision by the Gestapo and had Cecilienhof watched. In January 1945, Wilhelm left Potsdam for Oberstdorf for a treatment of his gall and liver problems. Cecilie fled in early February 1945 as the Red Army drew closer to Berlin, without being able to salvage much in terms of her possessions. At the end of the war, Cecilienhof was seized by the Soviets. Potsdam Conference of 1945 Potsdam Conference: Churchill, Truman and Stalin in the Cecilienhof garden, 25 July 1945 The Potsdam Conference (officially the \\"Berlin Conference\\") took place from 17 July to 2 August 1945. It was the third and longest summit between the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States, the major forces in the anti-Hitler-coalition that had just won the war after VE day, 8 May 1945. The conference was mainly organized by the Soviets. Although the British prime minister Winston Churchill had refused to hold a summit \\"anywhere within the current Soviet military zone\\", US President Harry Truman and Soviet leader Josef Stalin had agreed in late May 1945 to meet \\"near Berlin\\". As Berlin itself had been too heavily damaged by Allied bombing and street-to-street fighting, Cecilienhof in Potsdam was selected as the location for the conference. The delegations were to be housed in the leafy suburb of Potsdam-Babelsberg, which had suffered only slight damage in the bombing raids and also offered the advantage that the streets to the conference venue were easy to guard. Soviet soldiers repaired the streets connecting Babelsberg to Cecilienhof, built a pontoon bridge to replace the Glienicker Br√ºcke, which had been destroyed during the last days of the war, planted trees, bushes and flower beds‚Äîincluding the Soviet red star in the Ehrenhof of the palace. At Cecilienhof, 36 rooms and the great hall were renovated and furnished with furniture from other Potsdam palaces. The furniture of Wilhelm and Cecilie had been removed by the Soviets and stored at the Dairy. The main rooms used for the conference were as follows: * Cecilie's music salon‚ÄîWhite Salon, used by the Soviet delegation as a reception room (on the first day of the conference, this was also the site of a buffet Stalin provided to the other delegations), * Cecilie's writing room‚ÄîRed Salon, used by the Soviet delegation as a study, * Great hall‚Äîthis was the conference hall, fitted by the Soviets with a round table of 10 feet diameter (probably custom-made by a Moscow-based furniture company), * Wilhelm's smoking room‚Äîstudy of the American delegation, * Wilhelm's library‚Äîstudy of the British delegation, * Wilhelm's breakfast room‚Äîpossibly used as a secretary's office. However, according to the official guide to the palace, evidence has recently emerged that indicates that the current designation of the British and American studies may have been switched by the Soviets after the conference. Post World War II and today After the conference ended, Soviet troops used the palace as a clubhouse. It was handed over to the state of Brandenburg and in 1952 a memorial for the Conference was set up in the former private chambers of Wilhelm and Cecilie. The government of Eastern Germany also used the palace as a reception venue for state visits. The rest of the complex became a hotel in 1960. Some of the rooms were used by the ruling party (SED) for meetings. However, after 1961, a part of the Neuer Garten was destroyed to build the southwest section of the Berlin Wall (as part of the Grenzsicherungsanlagen) which ran along the shore of Jungfernsee. Beginning in 1985, the VEB Reiseb√ºro (state-owned travel agency) modernised the hotel. Today, parts of Cecilienhof are still used as a museum and as a hotel. In 1990 it became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site called Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin. The private rooms were opened to the public in 1995 after comprehensive restoration work. Queen Elizabeth II visited Cecilienhof on 3 November 2004. On 30 May 2007, the palace was used for a summit by the G8 foreign ministers. In 2011, Schloss Cecilienhof was awarded the European Heritage Label. The redesigned permanent exhibition on the Potsdam Conference was reopened in April 2012.

He achieved fame by becoming the youngest Briton to climb Mount Everest in 2005, aged 21 years 4 months. In doing so, Meyer also became the youngest man in the world to complete the Seven Summits challenge.. More recently in 2018 he summited K2, the second highest mountain in the world. He has taken part in over 30 expeditions around the world.  Early life  From Tetbury in Gloucestershire, England, Meyer was educated at Beaudesert Park School, Hawtreys, Cheam School and Marlborough College, then embarked on the study of Environmental Geoscience at Bristol University, where he was also a member of Bristol University Officer Training Corps. He has since been commissioned into the Royal Wessex Yeomanry as an Armoured Troop Leader and has served in Afghanistan.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/army-reservist- jake-meyer-becomes-10th-briton-to-scale-k2-the-world-s-second-highest- mountain-93ndrvm3b Meyer began climbing at 13. Aged 15, he saw in the new millennium with his father from the crater rim of his first summit, Kilimanjaro. At 18, he climbed Mount Elbrus in Southern Russia, Europe's highest peak. In 2002, he was awarded with a Winston Churchill Memorial Trust travelling fellowship to climb Elbrus (aged 18), Aconcagua (aged 18), Denali (aged 19) and Mount Kosciuszko (aged 19), the highest peaks in North and South America and Australia. He then climbed Mount Vinson, the highest peak in Antarctica, before attempting Everest. Everest Meyer ascended from the Tibetan side, via the North Col-North East Ridge route. The climb started on 2 April 2005, reaching the summit on 4 June 2005. He was accompanied by Diahanne Gilbert, the Scottish team leader, and two Sherpas, Mingma Nuru and Anil Bhattarai. Meyer's climb was in aid of the Children's Wish Foundation. Mountaineering/Adventures Meyer is a self-confessed peak- bagger/Highpointer and enjoys collecting country highpoints around the world. Many of these are not considered technical challenges, or may not even count as a true mountain, however they often represent a logistical challenge, or a mini adventure to a country, region or area which he wouldn't otherwise travel to, and visit with family/friends. To date this includes: *Europe: UK, Ireland, Spain, Malta, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Russia *North America:USA, Mexico, Barbados *South America: Argentina, Chile, Venezuela, Ecuador *Asia: Nepal/China, Pakistan, Oman, Kuwait, UAE, Bahrain, Jordan *Africa: Egypt; Morocco; Kenya; Tanzania; Lesotho, South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini (Swaziland), Mauritius *Australasia: Mt Kosciuszko *Antarctica: Vinson Massif Records Meyer has broken and holds or has previously held several records: *Youngest Briton to climb Mount Everest (2005-held until 2006). His \\"youngest Briton to climb Mount Everest\\" record was broken in 2006 by Rob Gauntlett who was 19 at the time. *Youngest man in the world to have completed the Seven Summits (Bass Variant). Meyer was 'pipped at the post' to the title of youngest person in the world to climb the Seven Summits by 20-year-old American Danielle Fisher, who summitted three days earlier, taking the South Col route, but was able to claim the 'youngest man in the world to complete the Seven Summits' *Youngest ascent of Mount Vinson (highest mountain in the Antarctic) (2004 - held for 8 days!) *Youngest solo ascent of Mount Aconcagua (highest mountain outside the Himalayas) (2002) *Tenth (and youngest) Briton to summit K2 2018. His successful summit was the culmination of 3 attempts over 9 years (2009, 2016 and 2018). At the time he was the seventh Briton to have survived summiting K2. Meyer used his 2016 and 2018 expeditions to raise money for Walking With The Wounded. *Shortest time to visit the highest point in every county in the UK. 82 counties, metropolitan counties and unitary authorities in 7 days, 4 hours and 20 minutes (2008) *Shortest time to climb the highest peak in each of the 48 states of the Continental USA. The Freestyle Challenge was completed in 23 days 19 hours 31 minutes in 2006 as Meyer reached the summit of Mount Katahdin in Maine. The British team shaved nearly six days off the existing record of 29 days, previously held by American Ben Jones. Meyer's record held for nearly 9 years until it was broken by American's Josh and Lindsay Sanders in a time of 19 days, 7 hours and 37 minutes.  Personal life  Jake married Saskia Stoop in 2013. They have three daughters: Ottalie (born 2014), Poppy (born 2016) and Sienna (born 2020). They currently live in Earlsfield, London. He is a full- time leadership development consultant for The Inspirational Development Group, a UK based global development consultancy. He was the first ambassador for the British watch maker Bremont, and is their longest serving ambassador.

In the mid-8th century BCE, Bian He (ÂçûÂíå) of Chu discovered an unworked piece of valuable jade and presented it to two successive kings, each of whom judged the jade to be a worthless stone and punished his apparent deception with a foot amputation. When the jade was finally cut and polished into a ritual bi (Áíß, \\"jade-disk with a round hole in center\\") it was recognized as a priceless treasure. Mr. He's jade-disk became an object of contention among the Warring States, it was stolen from Chu circa the 4th century BCE, acquired by the Zhao, and temporarily traded to Qin in 283 BCE. When the Qin dynasty was founded in 221 BCE, Mr. He's renowned bi jade was carved into the Heirloom Seal of the Realm, which was transmitted through subsequent Chinese dynasties until it was lost during the 10th century. Terminology Uncut jade Bi jade-disk with dragon designs, 4th-2nd century BCE Huang semi-circular jade pendant, 9th-8th century BCE Modern Standard Chinese H√©sh√¨b√¨ (ÂíåÊ∞èÁíß, \\"Mr. He's jade-disk\\") has a literary synonym H√©sh√¨zhƒ´b√¨ (ÂíåÊ∞è‰πãÁíß) using the Classical Chinese grammatical possessive affix zhƒ´ (‰πã). When Bian He (ÂçûÂíå) is read as a typical Chinese name, Bi√†n (Âçû, lit. \\"law; rule; impetuous\\") is the surname (e.g., Bian Lan) and H√© (Âíå, \\"harmonious; agreeable; comfortable\\") is the given name. However, He is also an uncommon surname (e.g., He Qia) and early texts refer to Bian He as both Bianshi (ÂçûÊ∞è, \\"Mr. Bian\\") and Heshi (ÂíåÊ∞è, \\"Mr. He\\"), with the word sh√¨ (Ê∞è, \\"clan; family; [a suffix after surnames] Mr., Mrs., or Ms.\\"). Most scholars translate Heshi as \\"Mr. He\\" with suffixed shi, some as \\"Master He\\" (Yap 2016: 182), and a few literally interpret shi and translate Heshi as \\"He Clan\\" (Nienhauser 1995: 263) or \\"He family\\" (Knoblock and Riegel 2000: 236). Some alternate names for Mr. He are Heshi (Èæ¢Ê∞è, with the ancient variant character H√©), Heshi (ÂíºÊ∞è, with the unique variant Gu≈ç (Âíº) only pronounced He in this name), and Jing He (ËçäÂíå, \\"He from Jingzhou\\", an ancient name for Chu). B√¨ (Áíß, \\"carved jade-disk with a round hole in center\\") is an ancient Chinese artifact, dating back to the Liangzhu culture (3400‚Äì2250 BCE). Bi signified heavenly kingship in Zhou times, and were \\"often used ceremonially as symbolic of a covenant or guarantee, as between persons, states, heaven and a dynastic house, etc.\\" (Kroll 2017: 17). In addition to denoting \\"ceremonial stone disks, usually of jadeite, or similar-looking gemstones\\", the word can also be used more loosely referring to \\"jade in general\\" (Hill 2015 1: 274). B√¨ < Old Chinese *piÃØ…ík (Áíß) originally named \\"a flat stone ring\\", but the word was also used interchangeably with p√¨ < *piÃØ√§k (Á§ï), \\"dark blue-green stone\\" and sometimes \\"luminescent blue-green stone\\" probably \\"chlorophane\\" (Schafer 1963: 238). Many Chinese classics refer to Bian He's jade-disk in context with other legendary gems, jades, and swords constituting the ceremonial regalia of ancient Chinese states. The most common example is Marquis of Sui's pearl, a legendary glow-in-the-dark gemstone given to the marquis by a grateful snake whose life he saved. Other luminous gemstones frequently mentioned with Mr. He's jade-disk (e.g., Shiji below) are the yeguangzhibi (Â§úÂÖâ‰πãÁíß, \\"night-shining jade-disk\\") or yeguangzhizhu (Â§úÂÖâ‰πãÁè†, \\"night-shining pearl\\") and m√≠ngyu√®zhƒ´zh≈´ (ÊòéÊúà‰πãÁè†, \\"bright-/luminous-moon pearl\\"). These ancient Chinese names were sufficiently well-known to have been applied to foreign gemstones in the earliest accounts of Daqin (the Roman Empire). \\"The Kingdom of Daqin\\" section of the 5th-century Book of the Later Han, which was largely based on Ban Yong's report presented to Emperor An of Han in around 125, lists precious Roman trade goods including \\"luminous jade [Â§úÂÖâÁíß]\\" and \\"bright moon pearls [ÊòéÊúàÁè†]\\" (tr. Hill 2015 1: 25). Mr. He's jade-disk is occasionally (e.g., Huainanzi below) mentioned with the Xiahou clan's semi-circular jade pendant: Xiahoushi zhi huang (Â§èÂêéÊ∞è‰πãÁíú), which was a fabulous jewel supposedly included in the ducal regalia of Lu state (Major et al. 2010: 247). Xi√†h√≤u (Â§èÂêé) is a Chinese compound surname from the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BCE), and the hu√°ng (Áíú, \\"semi-circular jade pendant\\") was anciently used for ritual purposes or as a belt ornament. Tai'e or Tai'a (Â§™Èòø) is the name of a famous Spring and Autumn period iron sword that is usually considered one of the ten legendary swords of China. The legendary bladesmith Ou Yezi made three swords for King Goujian (r. 496‚Äì465 BCE) of Yue, named T√†i'ƒì (Ê≥∞Èòø, Great Riverbank), L√≥ngyuƒÅn (ÈæçÊ∏ä, Dragon Gulf), and G≈çngb√π (Â∑•Â∏É, Artisanal Display) (tr. Milburn 2010: 285). Legends The Chinese story of Mr. He's jade-disk has been repeatedly iterated for over two millennia. =Hanfeizi= The earliest extant account is the Heshi (ÂíåÊ∞è, \\"Mr. He\\") chapter of the c. 3rd-century BCE Legalist classic Hanfeizi, attributed to Han Fei (c. 280-233 BCE). The Hanfeizi version involves Mr. He presenting his jade to the first three \\"kings\\" of Chu state: \\"King Li of Chu\\" (Ê•öÂé≤Áéã) posthumously refers to Viscount Fenmao (r. 757-741 BCE), his brother King Wu of Chu (Ê•öÊ≠¶Áéã, r. 740-690 BCE) who was the first to style himself \\"king\\", and his son King Wen of Chu (Ê•öÊñáÁéã, r. 689-677 BCE). Several Hanfeizi commentaries say these three 8th-century BCE Chu rulers of Pian He should be three 11th-century BCE Zhou dynasty rulers: King Wu of Zhou (Âë®Ê≠¶Áéã, r. c. 1050-1043 BCE) who founded the Zhou dynasty, his father King Wen of Zhou (Âë®ÊñáÁéã, r. 1100-1050), and King Cheng of Zhou (Âë®ÊàêÁéã, r. 1042-1021 BCE). The posthumous names for princes and kings of many dynasties after the Chu imitated these famous Zhou royal names Wu (Ê≠¶, \\"Martial; Military; Valiant\\") and Wen (Êñá, \\"Cultured; Civilizing\\")‚Äîw√©n-w«î (ÊñáÊ≠¶, means \\"civil and military\\"). The following three English translations of Hanfeizi illustrate the range of interpretations. The first (Liao 1939) changes the Chu Kings Li, Wu, and Wen to the Zhou Kings Wu, Wen, and Cheng; the next (Watson 1964) translates with two Chu Kings Li and Wu, omitting Wen and having Wu reexamine the jade (cf. Chuci below); and the third (Yap 2016) gives the original three Chu Kings. First, W.K. Liao notes his translation follows the Hanfeizi commentary of Wang Xianshen (ÁéãÂÖàÊÖé;1859‚Äì1918), based on the 212 CE Huainanzi commentary by Gao You, that the three successive rulers with whom Bian He met were the Zhou kings, thus \\"throughout my translation Ê≠¶Áéã is found in place of Âé≤Áéã, ÊñáÁéã in place of Ê≠¶Áéã, and ÊàêÁéã in place of ÊñáÁéã.\\" > Once a man of Ch'u, named Pien Ho, came by an uncut jade in the Ch'u Hills. > He brought it home and submitted it as a present to King Wu. Thereupon King > Wu had a jeweller give an opinion of it. \\"It is an ordinary stone,\\" said the > jeweller. The King, regarding Ho as a liar, had his left foot cut off. Upon > King Wu's death, King W√™n ascended the throne, when Ho again submitted it as > a present to King W√™n. King W√™n also had a jeweller give an opinion of it. > Again he said, \\"It is an ordinary stone.\\" The King, also regarding Ho as a > liar, had his right foot cut off. When King W√™n died and King Ch'√™ng > ascended the throne, Ho, carrying the uncut jade in his arms, cried at the > foot of the Ching Hills. After three days and three nights his tears were > all exhausted and blood flowed out. At this news the King sent men out to > ask him the reason, saying, \\"Throughout All-under-Heaven men whose feet were > cut off are many. Why should you be crying so bitterly?\\" \\"I am lamenting not > the loss of my feet,\\" said Ho in reply, \\"but for the calling a precious gem > an ordinary stone and for their dubbing an honest man a liar. This is the > reason why I am lamenting.\\" Meanwhile, the King had a jeweller polish up the > jade and got the treasure out at last. So it was designated \\"the Jade of > Pien Ho\\" [ÂíåÊ∞è‰πãÁíß]. (tr. Liao 1939: 113) The subsequent Hanfeizi context criticizes contemporary rulers and recommends that a wise person who hopes to avoid punishment should not present a ruler any \\"uncut jewels of wisdom and statecraft\\" (tr. Watson). Second, Burton Watson notes that sources vary over the list of Chu kings to whom Bian He presented his treasure, and has King Wu rather than King Wen discover the jade's high value. > Once a man of Ch‚Äôu named Mr. Ho, having found a piece of jade matrix in the > Ch‚Äôu Mountains, took it to court and presented it to King Li. King Li > instructed the jeweler to examine it, and the jeweler reported, ‚ÄúIt is only > a stone.‚Äù The king, supposing that Ho was trying to deceive him, ordered > that his left foot be cut off in punishment. In time King Li passed away and > King Wu came to the throne, and Ho once more took his matrix and presented > it to King Wu. King Wu ordered his jeweler to examine it, and again the > jeweler reported, ‚ÄúIt is only a stone.‚Äù The king, supposing that Ho was > trying to deceive him as well, ordered that his right foot he cut off. Ho, > clasping the matrix to his breast, went to the foot of the Ch‚Äôu Mountains, > where he wept for three days and nights, and when all his tears were cried > out, he wept blood in their place. The king, hearing of this, sent someone > to question him. ‚ÄúMany people in the world have had their feet amputated‚Äîwhy > do you weep so piteously over it?‚Äù the man asked. He replied, ‚ÄúI do not > grieve because my feet have been cut off. I grieve because a precious jewel > is dubbed a mere stone, and a man of integrity is called a deceiver. This is > why I weep.‚Äù The king then ordered the jeweler to cut and polish the matrix, > and when he had done so a precious jewel emerged. Accordingly it was named > ‚ÄúThe Jade of Mr. Ho.‚Äù (13, tr. Watson 1964: 80-81). Third, Joseph P. Yap translates the Hanfeizi story with the three Chu kings Li, Wu, and Wen. > At around 8th century BCE, Bian He a jeweller from the kingdom of Chu > discovered a piece of stone; he knew from experience that it was a piece of > priceless jade. He presented the piece of stone to King Li of Chu, (757-741 > BCE). The king thought the jeweller was trying to deceive him and had his > left foot chopped off as a punishment. When the next king, King Wu of Chu > (r. 740-691 BCE) ascended to the throne, Bian He again presented the piece > of stone to the new king; this time, the king had his right foot chopped off > as he also maintained that the jeweller was trying to deceive him. Bian He > embracing his piece of stone cried for three days and three nights at the > foothills of Jingshan Mountain. Much later, when King Wen of Chu (r. 690-675 > BCE) ascended the throne the king sent someone to ask the jeweller why he > was so adamant about his belief. He answered, 'This is a piece of priceless > jade, and the two former kings regarded it as a useless piece of stone. I am > not saddened by the loss of my feet, but I am distressed by the fact that a > patriot is misconstrued as being wicked and evil.\\" [The king] then asked a > jade expert to cut open the stone, and it transpired that it was indeed a > piece of priceless jade. Legend has it that it was pure white and flawless. > The king of Chu named it Heshibi, Master He's jade. (tr. Yap 2016: 182) =Gao's Huainanzi commentary= The next significant version of Pian He's story is found in Gao You's 212 CE Huainanzi commentary for the passage (below) that compares the Way of Heaven with the Marquis of Sui's pearl and Mr. He's jade-disk. Gao changes the original three Chu kings state to the three Zhou kings. > A man from Ch'u named Pien Ho found a piece of unpolished jade at the foot > of the Ching Mountains. He offered it as tribute to King Wu [of the Chou > dynasty]. King Wu had it inspected by a jade expert, who declared it to be > ordinary stone. [Pien Ho] had his left leg cut off [as punishment]. When > King Wen came to the throne, [Pien Ho] once more presented the jade. King > Wen took it to be ordinary stone, and [Pien Ho] had his right leg cut off. > Pien Ho wrapped the jade carefully and wept tears of blood. When King Ch'eng > ascended the throne, Pien Ho once again presented the jade. King Ch'eng > said: 'Dear sir, you disregard having your legs cut off, as long as you can > have your jade piece cut up for examination.' As soon as the stone was cut, > it appeared that it was truly fine jade, and it was made into a jade disk > (pi). (tr. Le Blanc 1985: 132). The above English translations consistently render most Chinese words, such as yu√® (Âàñ, \\"foot amputation, one of the Five Punishments): \\"had his left foot cut off\\" (Liao), \\"ordered that his left foot be cut off in punishment\\" (Watson), \\"had his left foot chopped off as a punishment\\" (Yap), \\"had his left leg cut off [as punishment]\\" (Le Blanc). However, the translators differ over four key terms describing what Bian He found, where he found it, the king's expert, and his appraisal. Y√πp√∫ (ÁéâÁíû, \\"uncarved jade\\"; now usually p√∫y√π ÁíûÁéâ): \\"an uncut jade\\" (Liao), \\"a piece of jade matrix\\" (Watson), \\"a piece of stone\\" (Yap), and \\"a piece of unpolished jade\\" (Le Blanc). Wang Xianshen's commentary says Chushan (Ê•öÂ±±, Chu Mountains) should be Jingshan (ËçÜÂ±±, Jing Mountains in ancient Chu): \\"Ch'u Hills\\" (Liao), \\"Ch‚Äôu Mountains\\" (Watson). \\"Ching Mountains\\" (Le Blanc), and untranslated (Yap). Y√πr√©n (Áéâ‰∫∫, lit. \\"jade person\\") is either translated in reference to the king's \\"jeweller\\" (Liao), \\"jeweler\\" (Watson), and \\"jade expert\\" (Le Blanc); or in reference to Mr. He himself \\"jeweller\\" (Yap). The expert appraises Mr. He's jade as a sh√≠ (Áü≥, \\"stone; rock\\"): \\"ordinary stone\\" (Liao, Le Blanc), ‚Äúonly a stone‚Äù (Watson), and untranslated (Yap). History Beginning with the Zhanguo ce and Shiji, many Chinese histories have discussed Mr. He's jade-disk but the early historicity remains uncertain. =Zhanguo ce= The 3rd-century BCE Zhanguo ce (Strategies of the Warring States), which is a compendium of political and military anecdotes dating from 490 to 221 BCE, relates that Mr. He's jade-disk was a national treasure of Chu, stolen from the Prime Minister, and eventually obtained by Zhao state. King Wei of Chu (r. 339-329 BCE) bestowed the priceless jade upon Prime Minister Zhao Yang (Êò≠ÈôΩ) in gratitude for his defeat of the Yue kingdom in 333 BCE. On one occasion, Zhao Yang displayed the jade for his guests at a banquet when someone started a commotion, and in the midst of the confusion, the jade-disk disappeared. The School of Diplomacy political strategist Zhang Yi (fl. 328-309 BCE) was accused as the thief, and Zhao Yang had him questioned under torture before he was released. After this incident, the whereabouts of the jade was lost until it resurfaced at Zhao (Yap 2016: 182). The Zhanguo ce records how another School of Diplomacy strategist Su Qin (380-284 BCE) persuaded Li Dui (ÊùéÂÖå), the Chancellor of Zhao, to provide Mr. He's jade-disk in order to acquire funding for the Vertical Alliance of six states against Qin. During their first audience, Su Qin convincingly explained his Vertical Alliance strategies to Li Dui and said, \\"You killed your ruler, [i.e., King Wuling of Zhao], and you extirpated his kin, and find your position in the empire as perilous as though you were perched atop a pile of eggs. If you heed my plans you will live; if you heed them not you will die.\\" After Li told Su to return on the next day for an audience, one of his attendants said Su's \\"arguments and their scope are beyond you. Will you be able to do as he advises?\\" Li replied that he could not and followed the attendant's suggestion that he plug up his ears in order to avoid listening to Su's rhetoric. Su Qin persuasively spoke for the entire day during the second audience with Li. When the attendant escorted him out, Su asked \\"A day ago I spoke only crudely and your ruler was moved. Today I spoke in detail and he was not. Why?\\" \\"Your plans are great and their scope is lofty, sir\\", replied the attendant. \\"My lord cannot use them, so I asked him firmly to stop both his ears so that he would not heed what was said. However, come again on the morrow and I will ask that the Master be well rewarded.\\" During the final audience, Li Dui gave Su Qin \\"a moon pearl [Áß¶ÊòéÊúà‰πãÁè†], the Jade of Ho [ÂíåÊ∞è‰πãÁíß], a black sable coat and a hundred pieces of pure gold.\\" Thus, Su got the wealth he needed in order to go westward into Qin state. (250, tr. Crump 1970: 314-315). =Shiji= The Han dynasty historiographer Sima Qian's c. 94 BCE Shiji (Records of the Grand Historian) relates the history and background of Hr. He's jade-disk in two biographies. The Shiji \\"Biographies of Lian Po and Lin Xiangru\\" section records a famous story that in 283 BCE, King Zhaoxiang of Qin (r. 306-251 BCE) schemed to obtain Mr. He's bi disk‚Äîthis is the first recorded usage of modern term Heshibi ÂíåÊ∞èÁíß without classical zhi ‰πã‚Äîfrom King Huiwen of Zhao (r. 298-266 BCE) and deceitfully offered to trade away a large portion of Qin territory for the jade. However, when Xiangru discovered that Zhaoxiang never intended to give away Qin land, he tricked the king and managed to return the jade-disk back to Zhao. \\"During the time of King Huiwen, Zhao [Ë∂ô] acquired Chu's Jade of the Ho Clan [Ê•öÂíåÊ∞èÁíß]. King Zhao [Êò≠] of Qin heard of this and sent a messenger to deliver a letter to the King of Zhao, saying that he wished to offer fifteen walled cities in exchange for the jade-disk [È°ò‰ª•ÂçÅ‰∫îÂüéË´ãÊòìÁíß].\\" The King of Zhao was distrustful and told his advisors \\"If we give it to Qin, we most likely will not obtain Qin‚Äôs cities, but will only be cheated. If we do not give it, then we must fear the arrival of Qin‚Äôs soldiers.\\" The king sought the opinion of Lin Xiangru, who said, \\"Qin is mighty and Zhao is weak, you must grant his request.\\" The king replied, \\"If he takes my jade, but gives us no cities, what then?\\" Lin said, \\"If Qin seeks the jade with its cities and Zhao does not accede, the fault lies with Zhao. If Zhao gives Qin the jade and Qin does not give Zhao the cities, the fault lies with Qin. In weighing these two measures, it would be better to accede, and lay the fault on Qin.\\" Xiangru agreed to undertake the mission to Qin, and promised the king, \\"If the cities are granted to Zhao, the jade will remain in Qin; if the cities are not granted, allow your servant to return to Zhao with the jade intact.\\" When Lin Xiangru arrived in the Qin capital, he respectfully presented the jade to King Zhaoxiang with both hands. The king was delighted and \\"passed it around to his Beauties and courtiers, who all shouted 'Long live the King!'\\" When Xiangru realized that the King of Qin had no intention of honoring the agreement, he came forward and said, \\"The jade has a flaw. Allow me to show it to Your Majesty.\\" The king handed him the jade, and Xiangru retreated and stood with his back to a pillar. With his \\"hair bristling against his hat in rage,\\" he threatened to destroy the jade. \\"It seems to me that Your Majesty has no intention of giving the King of Zhao the cities owed him. Thus I have reclaimed the jade. If you must press me, Great King, my head and the jade will both shatter against this pillar!\\" Since the King of Qin feared the jade would be demolished, he apologized and said, \\"The fifteen cities from here on will be given to Zhao.\\" Concluding that Zhao would never acquire the Qin cities, Xiangru then told the king, \\"The jade of the Ho Clan [ÂíåÊ∞èÁíß] is a treasure that the entire world has transmitted with reverence.\\" He then falsely said that before the King of Zhao sent off the jade, he fasted and purified himself for five days, and convinced the King of Qin that he too needed to fast for five days, after which, \\"your servant would dare to offer up the jade.\\" The king agreed, and while he was fasting, Xiangru arranged for his retainer to disguise himself as a commoner, conceal the jade, and safely smuggle it back to Zhao. After the King of Qin had finished fasting and purification, he held a ritual ceremony in his court, and when Lin Xiangru arrived, he confessed having secretly sent the jade back to Zhao and then insulted the king's ancestors, \\"Out of the twenty odd lords of Qin since Duke Mu Á©Ü (r. 659-621 B.C.), not one has honored his agreements and oaths. Your servant truly feared he would be cheated by Your Majesty and thus betray Zhao.\\" Xiangru told the enraged king that he would willingly accept the Qin death penalty for deceiving a king, and requested the pƒìng (ÁÉπ, \\"death by boiling\\") punishment. Although some of the courtiers wanted to boil Xiangru immediately, the King of Qin said, \\"If We kill Xiangru now, We still cannot acquire the jade, and it would ruin the good relations between Qin and Zhao. It would be better to treat him with great civility instead, then send him back to Zhao.\\" After Xiangru had returned, the King of Zhao praised the skillful diplomacy of his mission to Qin, and appointed him Senior Grand Master (81, tr. Nienhauser 1995: 263-265, Wade-Giles changed to Pinyin romanization). This story is the source of the Chinese idioms ji√†zh√≠li√°nch√©ng (ÂÉπÂÄºÈÄ£Âüé, lit. \\"as valuable as multiple cites\\") meaning \\"invaluable; priceless\\" and w√°nb√¨guƒ´zh√†o (ÂÆåÁíßÊ≠∏Ë∂ô, lit. \\"return the whole jade-disk to Zhao\\") \\"to return something intact to its rightful owner\\". The Shiji biography of Qin dynasty Grand chancellor Li Si (c. 280-208 BCE) collectively mentions Sui He zhi bao (Èö®Âíå‰πãÂØ∂, \\"treasures of [Marquis] Sui and [Mr.] He\\") in a letter advising Emperor Qin Shi Huang not to follow Zheng Guo's advice to expel all foreigners from Qin. > Now Your Majesty imports jade from the Kun Mountains and possesses the > treasures of Sui and He [Èö®Âíå‰πãÂØ∂]. Dangling moon-bright pearls [ÊòéÊúà‰πãÁè†], you > buckle on the sword Taia, are drawn by fine steeds like Xianli, set up > phoenix banners blazoned with kingfisher feathers, and employ drums of > sacred lizard skin. Not one of these various precious things is a product > native to Qin, and yet Your Majesty takes joy in them. Why? If something > must be a product of Qin before it can be acceptable, then no night-shining > jewels [Â§úÂÖâ‰πãÁíß] would adorn the court chambers, no vessels of rhinoceros horn > or elephant tusk would amuse and delight you, no women of Zheng and Wey > would throng the harem, and no fine horses and spirited thoroughbreds would > fill your stables. The gold and tin from south of the Yangtze could not be > utilized, the vermilion and blue of Shu could not be used for pigment. (87, > tr. Watson 1961 3: 182) =Imperial seal of China= ln 228 BCE, Qin overwhelmed the kingdom of Zhao and seized Mr. He's jade-disk from King Dai of Zhao. In 221 BCE, the Qin kingdom had conquered all six Warring States and Qin Shi Huangdi founded the Qin dynasty. The emperor ordered that the Heshibi jade-disk be carved into his imperial jade seal that read, \\"Having received the Mandate from Heaven, may (the emperor) lead a long and prosperous life.\\" (ÂèóÂëΩÊñºÂ§©, Êó¢Â£ΩÊ∞∏Êòå). The Qin Chancellor Li Si wrote this inscription in Seal script characters and Sun Shou (Â≠´Â£Ω) carved them into the jade. This Qin dynasty jade seal came to symbolize the Mandate of Heaven, and beginning when the last Qin ruler Ziying handed it over to Emperor Gaozu of Han in 206 BCE, it was successively passed on to later dynastic emperors signifying the right to govern the Chinese world. The Heirloom Seal of the Realm was lost sometime between the Tang and Ming dynasties. Another version of the legend claims that it was interred in the burial crypt of the first Emperor of Qin Shi Huangdi and the jade seal which was passed on for over one thousand years was another piece of jade from Lantian (Yap 2016: 183). Literature The jade-disk of Mr. He was mentioned in numerous classical Chinese texts, and present day Sinophones know the story from traditional chengyu idioms, such as w√°nb√¨guƒ´zh√†o (ÂÆåÁíßÊ≠∏Ë∂ô, lit. \\"return the whole jade-disk to Zhao\\") means \\"to return something intact to its rightful owner\\". The following literary examples are divided between using Mr. He's jade-disk as a trope for something valuable or using it with other legendary treasures such as the Marquis of Sui's pearl. =Heshibi as a single treasure= The c. 239 BCE L√ºshi Chunqiu (Master L√º's Spring and Autumn Annals) is an encyclopedic text compiled under the patronage of the Qin dynasty Chancellor L√º Buwei. The Mengdong (Â≠üÂÜ¨, \\"Almanac for the First Month of Winter\\") writes Mr. He (Èæ¢Ê∞è) with an early variant character. > Now, if one were to show a child a hundred pieces of gold and a ball of > glutinous millet, the child would surely take the millet. If one were to > show an ignorant person the jade disc of the He family [Èæ¢Ê∞è‰πãÁíß] and a hundred > pieces of gold, the ignorant man would surely take the gold. If one were to > show a worthy man a jade disk of the He family and the most perfect > teachings concerning the Dao and its Power, the worthy man would surely take > the teachings. The more refined one's knowledge, the more refined one's > choices. The cruder one's knowledge, the cruder one's choices. (10, tr. > Knoblock and Riegel 2000: 236) The preceding L√ºshi Chunqiu story similarly concerns \\"A rustic from Song found a jade while plowing and presented it to the Director of the City Walls, [who refused it and explained] \\"You regard jade as a treasure, but I regard not accepting it as a treasure.\\" The c. 3rd-1st century BCE Chuci (Songs of Chu) poetry anthology mentions the story of Bian He several times. \\"Disgust with the World\\" includes him in a context of rulers who rejected loyal people, \\"And I grieve, too, for Bian He, the man of Chu [ÊÇ≤Ê•ö‰∫∫‰πãÂíåÊ∞èÂÖÆ] / The jade he presented was judged worthless stone [ÁçªÂØ∂Áéâ‰ª•ÁÇ∫Áü≥] / Both King Li and King Wu refused to examine it / And he ended with both his feet cut off for his pains.\\" (tr. Hawkes 1985: 251). \\"Reckless Remonstrance\\" says, \\"Bian He clasps his block of jade and weeps tears of blood [ÂíåÊä±ÁíûËÄåÊ≥£Ë°ÄÂÖÆ] / Where can he find a craftsman good enough to shape it?\\" (tr. Hawkes 1985: 257). \\"Lament for the Worthy\\" includes Jing He in a list of loyal retainers who were mistreated, \\"Or Shen Sheng of Jin who met a hapless end / Or Jing He who wept tears of blood [ËçäÂíåÊ∞è‰πãÊ≥£Ë°Ä] / Or Shen Xu of Wu who had his eyes gouged out.\\" (tr. Hawkes 1985: 292). Two contexts in the c. 139 BCE Huananzi (quoted above) refer to Mr. Bian's (ÂçûÊ∞è) jade-disk and to Mr. He (ÂíåÊ∞è) crying bloody tears. \\"If you understand the proper sequence of things, you will be calm. Now when it came to giving away Mr. Bian's jade disk [ÂçûÊ∞è‰πãÁíß], when he had not yet obtained it, [Mr. Bian] was ahead. When he pleaded to present it and would not give up despite his indignation, he was behind.\\" (14.56, tr. Major et al. 2010: 565). \\"Thus when your [views] tally with what is essential, you will value what is true and [give] equal [consideration to] the present and the ancient. If you do not have the means to heed persuasions, then you will value what has come down from the past, [simply] because it is remote. This is why [Bian] He [ÂíåÊ∞è] cried so hard that he bled at the foot of Mount Jing. (19.7, tr. Major et al. 2010: 784). =Heshibi with other treasures= Shang dynasty (c. 1300-1046 BCE) bronze ding The Marquis of Sui's pearl is commonly used with Mr. He's jade- disk, for example, the Shiji lists \\"the treasures of Sui and He [Èö®Âíå‰πãÂØ∂] among Qin Shi Huangdi's imported valuables. The c. 4th-2nd centuries BCE Mozi ([Sayings of] Mozi) mentions them with the legendary Nine Tripod Cauldrons, namely, a set of Chinese ritual bronze ding \\"tripod cauldrons\\", said to have been cast by mythical Yu the Great after controlling the Great Flood. In response to criticism from his disciple Wu Mazi (Â∑´È¶¨Â≠ê) that \\"To leave contemporaries alone and to praise the early kings is to praise rotten bones\\", Mozi (c. 470-391 BCE) explains how a state's yi (\\"righteousness; justice\\") is more important than the ritual \\"efficacy\\" (l√¨, Âà© \\"benefit; profit\\") of its treasures. > The jade of Ho [ÂíåÊ∞è‰πãÁíß], the pearl of Duke Sui, and the nine tings‚Äîthese are > what the feudal lords value as excellent treasures. Can they enrich the > country, multiply the people, put the government in order, and place the > state in safety? Of course they cannot. Excellent treasures are to be valued > for their efficacy. Now since the jade of Ho, the pearl of Duke Sui, and the > nine tings cannot benefit men, then they are not the excellent treasures in > the world. On the other hand, if righteousness is employed in the government > of the state the population will be increased, the government will be in > order, and the state will be secure. The excellent treasures are to be > valued for their efficacy. Now righteousness can benefit men. So then > righteousness is the excellent treasure of the world. (11, tr. Mei 1929: > 215-216) The 3rd-century Hanfeizi Jie Lao (Ëß£ËÄÅ, \\"Explanations of Laozi\\") chapter uses He's jade-disk and Sui's pearl in order to differentiate between l«ê (Á¶Æ, \\"ritual; ceremony; good form; propriety\\") and w√©n (Êñá, \\"ornamentation; embellishment; elaboration; cultured\\"). > Propriety is the mode expressive of feelings. Embellishment is the > decoration of qualities. Indeed, the superior man takes the inner feelings > but leaves the outer looks, likes the inner qualities but hates the outer > decorations. Who judges inner feelings by outer looks, finds the feelings > bad. Who judges inner qualities by outer decorations, finds the inner > qualities rotten. How can I prove this? The jade of Pien Ho was not > decorated with the five bright colours [ÂíåÊ∞è‰πãÁíß‰∏çÈ£æ‰ª•‰∫îÈáá]. The bead of Marquis Sui > was not decorated with yellow gold. Their qualities are so good that nothing > is fit to decorate them. Verily, anything that functions only after being > decorated must have poor qualities. For this reason, between father and son > propriety is simple and not brilliant. Hence the saying: ‚ÄúPropriety is > superficial semblance only.‚Äù (tr. Liao 1939: 167) The c. 3rd-1st century BCE Chuci anthology collectively refers to Marquis Sui's pearl and Bian He's jade-disk as Sui He (Èö®Âíå), and with the Tai'e sword. The \\"Quenching the Light\\" poem says, \\"Shards and stones are prized as jewels / Sui and He rejected [ÊçêÊ£ÑÈö®Âíå] / The leaden knife is praised for sharpness / Tai E discarded as blunt.\\" (tr. Hawkes 1985: 277). King Liu An's c. 139 BCE Huainanzi (Philosophers of Huainan) philosophical compendium has five occurrences of Mr. He's jade-disk, three with the Marquis of Sui's pearl, and one with the Xiahou clan's jade. The \\"Surveying Obscurities\\" chapter figuratively uses these legendary gems as a simile for someone who has attained the Tiandao (Â§©ÈÅì, Way of Heaven), \\"It is like the pearl of Marquis Sui [Èö®‰æØ‰πãÁè†] / or the jade disk of Mr. He [ÂíåÊ∞è‰πãÁíß] / Those who achieved it became rich / those who lost it became poor.\\" (6.3, tr. Major et al. 2010: 218). \\"A Mountain of Persuasions\\" chapter mentions the treasures of Mr. He and Marquis Sui twice. The former explains the philosophical essence of Chinese jade. > When a piece of jade is moistened, it looks bright. [When struck], its sound > is slow and harmonious. How expansive are its aspects! With no interior or > exterior, it does not conceal its flaws or imperfections. Close up, it looks > glossy; from a distance, it shines brightly. It reflects like a mirror > revealing the pupil of your eye. Subtly it picks up the tip of an autumn > hair. It brightly illuminates the dark and obscure. Thus the jade disk of > Mr. He [ÂíåÊ∞è‰πãÁíß] and the pearl of the marquis of Sui [Èö®‰æØ‰πãÁè†] emerged from the > essence of a mountain and a spring. When the Superior Man wears them, he > complies with their purity and secures his repose. When lords and kings > treasure them, they rectify the world. (16.19, tr. Major et al. 2010: 631) The latter compares true understanding with wealth, \\"Acquiring an army of ten thousand men does not compare to hearing one word that is apposite / acquiring the pearl of the marquis of Sui [Èö®‰æØ‰πãÁè†] does not compare to understanding from whence events arise / Acquiring the jade disk of Mr. Gua [ÂíºÊ∞è‰πãÁíß] does not compare to understanding where events will lead.\\" (16.105, tr. Major et al. 2010: 652). The Huainanzi mentions Mr. He's jade-disk along with the Xiahou clan's semi-circular jade. \\"As for [ritual emblems like] the jade disk of Mr. He [ÂíºÊ∞è‰πãÁíß] and the jade half-disk of the Xiahou clan [Â§èÂêé‰πãÁíú],\\" if [courtiers] bow courteously and advance with them, they create harmony and amity. [But] at night because of thieves, they create resentment. Such is the difference between the right time and the wrong time.\\" (16.90, tr. Major et al. 2010: 649).

Held in Inglewood, California on April 23, 1977, the bout was not recognized as a unification fight by either of the sanctioning bodies without any specific reason given for withholding the sanction. As it turned out, the fight was one of the most-anticipated 10-round fights in history among boxing fans. Before the fight Alfonso Zamora was the first one of the so-called \\"Z boys\\" to become a world champion, when he knocked out Soo Hwan Hong in four rounds on March 14, 1975 in Inglewood. He defended his title three times before Zarate had his first world title shot; one of his challengers was Eusebio Pedroza, the future WBA world Featherweight champion, whom Zamora defeated by knockout in two rounds in Tijuana on April 3 of 1976. Zarate, for his part, won the WBC world title one year and two months after Zamora became WBA world champion, on May 8, 1976, when he defeated defending champion Rodolfo Martinez by an eighth round knockout in Inglewood. Zarate and Zamora were both once trained by the same man, Arturo Hernandez. But Hernandez sold Zamora's contract to his father, Alfonso Zamora Sr., and Mr. Zamora Sr. took this as a form of disrespect towards him and his son. Ever since, Zarate and Zamora's managerial teams carried on a war of words that was not missed by the Latin American sports media. Zarate had a record of 38-0 with 37 knockouts, and Zamora was 29-0, with 29 knockouts. Their combined record of 67-0 with 66 knockouts arguably made for one of the most power-punch-packed matchups in boxing history. Fans in Mexico and the rest of Latin America were captivated by the announcement of the fight. The fact that both the WBA and WBC refused to recognize it as a world championship bout did little, if anything, to cool the ardor of enthusiastic boxing fans. The fight The Los Angeles police department knew from experience, (such as the 1969 fight between Lionel Rose and Chucho Castillo, which was fought in Inglewood, and, much later on, the first bout between Riddick Bowe and Andrzej Go≈Çota) that boxing fights can end up in riots. Because of this, they sent an anti-riot squad to the Inglewood Forum on the day of the event. The anti-riot team would have to jump into the ring when, fifty two seconds into the fight, an apparently drunk fan jumped into it, with the apparent intention of attacking one of the combatants. The man did not reach any of the night's main stars, however, because five policemen were able to stop him, immediately took him out of the arena. Zamora and Zarate began slugging right after that incident, with Zamora earning the first round on the judge's scorecards by throwing more punches than Zarate. In the second round, Zamora appeared hurt after a right and left combination by Zarate, but he roared back to hit Zarate with a right and left combination of his own later in that round. Round three was filled with combinations from both fighters. Zarate, however, began to connect with long jabs and short-range hooks. Zamora began to throw wide punches and seemed spent. He suffered a knockdown towards the end of the round. By round four, Zarate looked stronger and fresher than Zamora. He kept attacking the WBA champion, who tried in vain to answer. Early in the round Zarate dropped Zamora twice and Alfonzo Zamora Sr. threw in the towel, giving Zarate a fourth round knockout victory. The aftermatch Immediately after the fight was over, Alfonso Zamora Sr. and Arturo Hernandez had a fight of their own, and the anti-riot police once again intervened, putting a stop to the fight between Zarate and Zamora's trainers. Zarate went on to lose to Wilfredo G√≥mez for G√≥mez's WBC World Jr. Featherweight championship. He defended his WBC World Bantamweight title five more times before losing it, on June 3rd of 1979, to Lupe Pintor by a fifteen round split decision in Las Vegas, Nevada. Admiration towards Zarate by boxing fans grew considerably after he beat Zamora. Zarate retired after losing to Pintor, but had a mildly successful comeback during the middle 1980s, going as far as challenging Jeff Fenech for the WBC World Jr. Featherweight championship on October 16, 1987 in Sydney, Australia. Zamora's popularity was not diminished after losing to Zarate, but his self-esteem was. Zamora lost his WBA World Bantamweight title in his very next fight, being knocked out in ten rounds by Panamanian Jorge Luj√°n on November 19 in Los Angeles. He only won four of his last eight bouts, retiring before the 1970s were over. A proposed \\"super-fight\\" against Wilfredo G√≥mez was mentioned early in 1983, but Zamora did not accept, as he had permanently retired from boxing.

Niccol√≤ Ammaniti, \\"Ai miei lettori\\", Branchie, Torino, Giulio Einaudi editore, 1997. In 1999, Branchie was adapted into a movie with the same title. In 1995 Ammaniti published, together with his father Massimo, the essay Nel nome del figlio. In 1996 he appeared with his sister in the low- budget movie Growing Artichokes in Mimongo. As a young Italian novelist, he wrote a short novel together with Luisa Brancaccio for the anthology Giovent√π Cannibale by Daniele Brolli (1996). In 1996 he also published the collection of short stories Fango. In 1999 it was published the novel Steal You Away (Ti prendo e ti porto via), and in 2001 he wrote the novel I'm Not Scared (Io non ho paura), winning the 2001 Viareggio Prize. This novel was also adapted into a film version directed by Gabriele Salvatores in 2003. In 2006, he published As God Commands (Come Dio comanda), winning the Strega Prize. The novel was adapted into a movie, once again by Gabriele Salvatores. In 2009, he published Let the Games Begin (Che la festa cominci). In 2010, he wrote Me and You (Io e te), which was later adapted into a movie directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. The script, co-written, among others, by Bertolucci and Ammaniti, was nominated for Best Screenplay at the 2013 David di Donatello awards and at the 2013 Italian Golden Globe. In 2015, he published the novel Anna. =Worklist= *Branchie, Roma, Ediesse, 1994. ; Torino, Einaudi, 1997. . *Ti prendo e ti porto via, Milano, Mondadori, 1999. . *Io non ho paura, Torino, Einaudi, 2001. . *Come Dio comanda, Milano, Mondadori, 2006. . *Che la festa cominci, Torino, Einaudi, 2009. . *Io e te, Torino, Einaudi, 2010. . *Anna, Torino, Einaudi, 2015. .

It was authorized and initiated by the order of the President of Pakistan Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1988. The designation is derived from Tupac Amaru II, the 18th-century revolutionary who led the war of liberation in Peru against the Spanish rule. The program is thought to be active as the ISI is currently engaged in covertly supporting Kashmiri separatists, Islamists and militants in their fight against the Indian authorities in Kashmir. The objectives of Operation Tupac were; a) to disintegrate India; b) to utilize the spy network to act as an instrument of sabotage; c) to exploit porous borders with Nepal and Bangladesh to set up bases and conduct operations. Though all the separatist militant groups received funding the Pro-Pakistani groups were reportedly favored.

Origins He was the son of Godfrey II and Lutgarde of Sulzbach.Frans Theuws and Nico Roymans, Land and Ancestors: Cultural Dynamics in the Urnfield Period and the Middle Ages in the Southern Netherlands, (Amsterdam University Press, 1999), 331. He was still an infant at his succession (therefore called dux in cunis) of which a few Brabantian vassals sought to take advantage to become independent of the duke (Wars of Grimbergen, 1141‚Äì1159). Career On 30 March 1147, Godfrey was present at the coronation of Henry Berengar, son of Conrad III of Germany, in Aachen. When Conrad left on Crusade, war began anew in 1148. Peace was elusive until the election of Conrad's successor, Frederick Barbarossa. By marriage to Margaret, daughter of Henry II of Limburg, Godfrey united two powerful and antagonistic houses in the region. In 1159 Godfrey ended the war with the Berthout, lords of Grimbergen, by burning their impressive castle at Grimbergen. In 1171, Godfrey was at war with Hainaut, but was defeated. In 1172, he bought the County of Aarschot from its wayward count Godfried III, which in future generations would give rise to the dynasty of the Dukes of Aarschot that remain to this day. In 1179, he gave his son Henry in marriage to a niece of Philip of Alsace, Count of Flanders. Between 1182 and 1184 Godfrey went on a Jerusalem campaign. In the interim, Barbarossa granted Henry the title \\"Duke of Brabant\\". Godfrey died in 1190, on 10 or 21 August. He left an increased territory and built the fortress of Nedelaer (near Vilvoorde). The ducal title was transmitted to his son at the Diet of Schw√§bisch Hall (September 1190). Marriages and children Godfrey married twice: *Firstly to Margaret of Limbourg, daughter of Henry II, Duke of Limburg, in 1158, by whom he had two children: at Medieval Lands ** Henry I, Duke of Brabant (1165 ‚Äì 5 Sep 1235).

It is related as a historical novel set in the late Roman Empire, in the second half of the Third Century. There is a science- fictional twist to the story, starting with hints of a time warp on the very first page and slowly revealing to the reader -- and the protagonist -- what is really going on behind the scenes. The story is told in a very vivid style, suggestive of cinematography. Plot summary The novel relates an episode in the life of Aulus Perennius, a middle-aged operative of the Bureau of Imperial Affairs, an agency which has evolved into an intelligence service over the life of the Empire. He is accompanied by his prot√©g√© Gaius, a dashing young cavalry officer with an unfortunate tendency to act without thinking, and an odd figure named Calvus, tall, slim, bald, incredibly strong, and rather clueless. (The story hints that Gaius is Aulus' biological son, but never makes a clear statement on the matter.) At the beginning of the story Aulus' own mentor, head of the Bureau of Imperial Affairs, has summoned him back to Rome on a matter urgent enough to pull him out of a deep-cover operation in Palmyra just as it was coming to its critical phase. (This scene is a bit reminiscent of James Bond being summoned by his own boss for a new assignment). At the direct behest of the emperor the Bureau has been ordered to provide Calvus with any sort of support requested, and Calvus has asked only for the services of the Bureau's best agent -- requesting Aulus by name. Invoking the authority of the Bureau, Aulus orders an ancient Liburnian out of dry-dock storage to be outfitted for a trip to Cilicia in southern Anatolia, technically a part of the Roman Empire but at that time under the control of Odenath, to provide some unspecified service for Calvus. En route they are beset by pirates and other parties; the story of the journey takes up the greater part of the book. (In a sea battle with pirates, the Romans face a desperate plight due to the authorities in Rome having failed to provide an adequate Marine contingent; capture by brutal Gothic and Herulian raiders; the apparent warm hospitality offered by an isolated Christian community turns out to mask a virulently bloodthirsty, fanatic sect; a giant, predatory Allosaurus, displaced from the distant past, rampages in the countryside...) Calvus, though taken for a male, is actually a female (of sorts) sent back from the far distant future to destroy the seed creche or \\"brood chamber\\" of monstrous aliens - intelligent social insects - who, by her time, have multiplied into billions, emerged from their underground creches, and are in the process of destroying the human race. As a desperate measure a set of six mutually telepathic sisters, including Calvus, are specially bred to be sent on the mission together. (The book hints that the future human race has evolved to be somewhat different from ourselves, and that the six sterile sisters - akin to worker ants or bees - are uncommon only in their preparation for this particular mission; there is a suggestion that, waging an existential struggle against social insects, future humanity was driven to emulate these enemies...) Calvus is the only one of the siblings to arrive at the proper time in the past; there are strong hints that the presence of a handful of extinct creatures such as dinosaurs and sabre-toothed cats in Aulus' time are a side effect of the unintentional displacement of the other siblings into the far distant past. The time-travel technology did not allow Calvus to take any weapons or other gadgets along, so she herself serves as the weapon. She has a limited ability to influence the thoughts of humans other than her sisters -- which is how she induced the emperor to issue orders for the Bureau's cooperation -- and at the end of the story she destroys the creche by self- destructing as a nuclear or thermal bomb. Before then, through her association with Aulus and separation from her sisters, she learns to experience her humanity almost in the way ordinary humans do.

The story takes place in the midst of the Roman Empire's Third Century Crisis. The Empire is in a very bad shape: Emperors replace each other rapidly, usually by civil war or coup d'√©tat; the current Emperor, Gallienus, has effective power only in Italy and parts of North Africa; to the west, the rival Emperor Postumus rules Gaul, while to the east Palmyra has become an effectively independent power and encroaches on Imperial territory; the urban population bursts out into frequent riots; the Imperial borders are broken, with Germanic Barbarians raiding overland and into the waters of the Mediterranean. Throughout the book, the protagonist Aulus Perennius is acting under the assumption that the Empire is irrevocably doomed - and still, he is doggedly and completely devoted to this doomed Empire, even when having seen much of its seamy side. In this he is similar to Poul Anderson' Dominic Flandry (who serves a space empire consciously modeled on the Roman Empire). Those who know the basics of Roman history are aware that in fact, this is far from the Empire's end - two decades hence, Diocletian will consolidate, launch the Dominate period and give the Empire another two centuries of life (and much longer to its eastern portion). However, the book provides a bit of secret history: The Roman Empire was indeed on the verge of collapse, about to fall already in the Third Century; it was Calvus, the traveler from the far future, who gave the Empire another lease on life. It was she who used her mental abilities to provide the young Diocletian with the qualities needed to fulfill his crucial role in history. In fact, the future Emperor had been present in the book's plot all along, though under a different name, and on the very first page Drake provides a clue of it to sharp-eyed readers. For herself, Calvus cared little about the Roman Empire and how long it would last - but she knew that to Aulus the future of the Empire was of paramount importance and that he would fight better when given such an incentive; also, contrary to her training and conditioning, she had come to care very much for Aulus and seek to make him happy... =Religion= Sol Invictus (\\"Unconquered Sun\\"), Perennius' favorite god Aulus Perennius is a staunch devotee of the Sun god, whose worship flourished in the Third Century Roman Empire, and calls upon this god at moments of crisis (\\"Unconquered Sun, Creator and Sustainer of life, give me now the strength I need!\\").\\"Birds of Prey\\", Ch. Thirty-Four He does not believe in the gods of the traditional Greek-Roman Pantheon, though he respects the goddess Roma as a manifestation of the Empire to whose service he is devoted. Perennius does not care much for Christianity, lumping it together with other Oriental mystery religions: \\"Fools and their mystery religions, their Isis and Attis and Christos! But when there is increasingly little hope for security in the world, how could anyone blame people who look for hope elsewhere?\\".\\"Birds of Prey\\", Ch. Nine Still, he has a thorough knowledge of the Christians, the basics of their theology and the differences between their various factions and sects - such knowledge of the Imperial society being needed in his professional capacity. When told by Calvus - who knew his future, which was her very ancient history - that a rump of the Roman Empire (i.e., the Byzantine Empire) would endure for a thousand years as a Christian theocracy, Perennius finds that unpalatable - but still prefers a Christian Empire to no Empire at all.

It is an adjective and prefix for texts, ceremonies or person associated with ≈õruti. The term, for example, refers to Brahmins who specialise in the ≈õruti corpus of texts, and ≈örauta Brahmin traditions in modern times can be seen in Kerala and Coastal Andhra. Etymology and meaning The Sanskrit word ≈örauta is rooted in ≈õruti (that which is heard, referring to scriptures of Hinduism). ≈örauta, states Johnson, is an adjective that is applied to a text, ritual practice or person, when related to ≈õruti. Klostermaier states that the prefix means \\"belonging to ≈õruti\\", and includes ceremonies and texts related to ≈õruti. The word is sometimes spelled Shrauta in scholarly literature.Shrauta sutra, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2015) History Spread via Indian religions, homa traditions are found all across Asia, from Samarkand to Japan, over a 3000-year history. A homa, in all its Asian variations, is a ceremonial ritual that offers food to fire and is ultimately descended from the Vedic religion. The tradition reflects a ritual eclecticism for fire and cooked food (Paka-yajna) that developed in Indian religions, and the Brahmana layers of the Vedas are the earliest surviving records of this., Quote: \\"The homa, the ritual offering of food in a fire, has had a prolific career in Asia over the course of more than three millennia. In various forms, rites of this type have become a part of most of the religions that arose in India as well as their extensions and offsprings from Samarqand to Japan. All of these homas ultimately descend from those of the Vedic religions, but at no point has the homa been stable. (...) The rules of Vedic fire offerings have come down to us in two parallel systems. A few of the later exegetical passages (brahmana) in the Vedas refer to cooked food (paka) offerings contrasted with the multiple-fire ritual otherwise being prescribed. (...) several ways in which a homa employing a cooked offering (pakayajana) can be distinguished from a Srauta offering (...)\\" Yajna or vedic fire sacrifice ritual, in Indian context, became a distinct feature of the early ≈õruti (Vedic) rituals. A ≈õrauta ritual is a form of quid pro quo where through the fire ritual, a sacrificer offered something to the gods, and the sacrificer expected something in return. The Vedic ritual consisted of sacrificial offerings of something edible or drinkable, such as milk, clarified butter, yoghurt, rice, barley, an animal, or anything of value, offered to the gods with the assistance of fire priests. This Vedic tradition split into ≈örauta (≈õruti-based) and Smarta (Smriti-based). The ≈örauta rituals, states Michael Witzel, are an active area of study and are incompletely understood. ≈örauta \\"fire ritual\\" practices were copied by different Buddhist and Jain traditions, states Phyllis Granoff, with their texts appropriating the \\"ritual eclecticism\\" of Hindu traditions, albeit with variations that evolved through the medieval times.Phyllis Granoff (2000), Other people's rituals: Ritual Eclecticism in early medieval Indian religious, Journal of Indian Philosophy, Volume 28, Issue 4, pages 399-424 The homa-style Vedic sacrifice ritual, states Musashi Tachikawa, was absorbed into Mahayana Buddhism and homa rituals continue to be performed in some Buddhist traditions in Tibet, China and Japan.

The first versions of the Kalpa (Vedanga) sutras were probably composed by the sixth century BCE, starting about the same time as the Brahmana layer of the Vedas were composed and most ritual sutras were complete by around 300 BCE. They were attributed to famous Vedic sages in the Hindu tradition.James Lochtefeld (2002), \\"Kalpa\\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing, , page 339 These texts are written aphoristic sutras style, and therefore are taxonomies or terse guidebooks rather than detailed manuals or handbooks for any ceremony. The ≈örautas≈´tras differ from the smƒÅrtas≈´tra based on sm·πõti (that which is remembered, traditions). The Smartasutras, in ancient vedic and post-vedic literature, typically refer to the g·πõhyas≈´tras (householder's rites of passage) and sƒÅmayƒÅcƒÅrikas≈´tras (right way to live one's life with duties to self and to relationships with others, dharma≈õƒÅstras). =≈örauta Sutras= BaudhayƒÅna ≈õulbas≈´tra state that the squares of any rectangle's width and length add up to the square of its diagonal. This is known in western literature as the Pythagorean theorem. The ≈örautas≈´tras form a part of the corpus of Sanskrit sutra literature. Their topics include instructions relating to the use of the ≈õruti corpus in great rituals and the correct performance of these major vedic ceremonies, are same as those found in the Brahmana layers of the Vedas, but presented in more systematic and detailed manner. Baudhayana srautasutra is probably the oldest text in the ≈õrautas≈´tra genre, and includes in its appendix a paribhƒÅ·π£ƒÅs≈´tra (definitions, glossary section). Other texts such as the early Apastamba ≈õrautas≈´tra and later composed Katyayana start with Paribhasa-sutra section. The ≈õulbas≈´tras or ≈õulvas≈´tras are appendices in the ≈õrautas≈´tras and deal with the mathematical methodology to construct geometries for the vedi (Vedic altar). The Sanskrit word ≈õulba means \\"cord\\", and these texts are \\"rules of the cord\\". They provide, states Kim Plofker, what in modern mathematical terminology would be called \\"area preserving transformations of plane figures\\", tersely describing geometric formulae and constants. Five ≈õulbasutras have survived through history, of which the oldest surviving is likely the BaudhayƒÅna ≈õulbas≈´tra (800-500 BCE), while the one by KƒÅtyƒÅyana may be chronologically the youngest (‚âà300 BCE). Rituals ≈örauta rituals and ceremonies refer to those found in the Brahmana layers of the Vedas. These include rituals related to fire, full moon, new moon, soma, animal sacrifice, as well as seasonal offerings made during Vedic times. These rituals and ceremonies in the Brahmanas texts are mixed and difficult to follow. A clearer description of the ritual procedures appeared in the Vedanga Kalpa-sutras. The Vedic rituals, states Burde, can be \\"divided into ≈örauta and G·πõhya rituals\\". ≈örauta rites relating to public ceremonies were relegated to the ≈örautasutras, while most Vedic rituals relating to rites of passage and household ceremonies were incorporated in the G·πõhyas≈´tras (literally, homely; also called Laukika or popular, states Lubin). However, the G·πõhyas≈´tras also added many new non- ≈örauta ceremonies over time. The ≈õrautas≈´tras generally focus on large expensive public ceremonies, while g·πõhyas≈´tras focus on householders and sa·πÉskƒÅras (rites of passage) such as childbirth, marriage, renunciation and cremation. The ≈õrautas≈´tra ceremonies are usually elaborate and require the services of multiple priests, while g·πõhyas≈´tra rituals can be performed without or with the assistance of a priest in the Hindu traditions. =Animal versus vegetarian sacrificial offerings= The ≈örauta rituals varied in complexity. The first step of a ≈örauta ritual was making of an altar, then the initiation of fire, next of Havir-yajnas recitations, then offering of milk or drinkable liquid drops into the fire, then prayers all with mantras. More complex ≈örauta rituals were based on moon's cycle (Darshapurnamasa) and the seasonal rituals. The lunar cycle ≈örauta sacrifices had no animal sacrifices, offered a Purodasha (baked grain cake) and Ghee (clarified butter) as an offering to gods, with recitation of mantras. According to Witzel, \\"the Pasubandha or ‚ÄúAnimal Sacrifice‚Äù is also integrated into the Soma ritual, and involves the killing of an animal.\\" The killing was considered inauspicious, and \\"bloodless\\" suffocation of the animal outside the offering grounds was practiced. The killing was viewed as a form of evil and pollution (papa, agha, enas), and reforms were introduced to avoid this evil in late/post-Rigvedic times. According to Timothy Lubin, the substitution of animal sacrifice in ≈örauta ritual with shaped dough (pistapasu) or pots of ghee (ajyapasu) has been practiced for at least 600 years, although such a substitution is not condoned in ≈örauta ritual texts. The discussions about substituting animal sacrifice with vegetarian offering, states Usha Grover, appear in section 1.2.3 of the Shatapatha Brahmana of the Yajurveda. This section, states Grover, presents the progressive change in the material offered to gods during a ≈örauta ritual. The change, adds Grover, may be related to Ahimsa (non- violence principle), or merely a means to preserve the number of cattle, or lack of availability of sacrificial animals. however, according to Grover, the ancient text suggests that \\"animal sacrifice was given up\\", and offering had become \\"vegetable, grains, milk and ghee\\". The view that ancient Vedic texts had begun asserting that vegetable offerings were as efficient as animal offerings, for certain sacrifices, is shared by Max M√ºller and others.Julius Eggeling, The Sacred Books of the East Part 1 Books I and II, Satapatha Brahmana 1.2.3.6 - 1.2.3.7, Oxford University Press, pages 50-52 with footnotes =Decline= According to Alexis Sanderson, ≈örauta ceremonies declined from the fifth to the thirteenth century CE. This period saw a shift from ≈örauta sacrifices to charitable grant of gifts such as giving cows, land, issuing endowments to build temples and sattrani (feeding houses), and water tanks as part of religious ceremonies.Nicholas Dirks (1976), Political Authority and Structural Change in Early South Indian History, Indian Economic and Social History Review, Volume 13, pages 144‚Äì157 =Contemporary practices= Most ≈örauta rituals are not performed in the modern era, and those that are, are rare. Some ≈örauta traditions have been observed and studied by scholars, as in the rural parts of Andhra Pradesh, and elsewhere in India and Nepal. ≈örauta traditions from Coastal Andhra have been reported by David Knipe, and an elaborate ≈õrauta ceremony was video recorded in Kerala by Frits Staal in 1975. According to Axel Michaels, the homa sacrifice rituals found in modern Hindu and Buddhist contexts evolved as a simpler version of the Vedic ≈örauta ritual. Knipe has published a book on ≈örauta practices from rural Andhra. The ≈örauta ritual system, states Knipe, \\"is an extended one, in the sense that a simple domestic routine has been replaced by one far more demanding on the religious energies of the sacrificer and his wife,\\" and is initiated by augmenting a family's single fire Grihya system to a three fire ≈örauta system. The community that continues to teach the ≈örauta tradition to the next generation also teaches the Smarta tradition, the choice left to the youth. The Andhra tradition may be, states Knipe, rooted in the ancient Apstamba ≈örauta and Grihya Sutras. In the Andhra traditions, after one has established the routine of the twice-daily routine of agnihotra offerings and biweekly dara p≈´r·πáamƒÅsa offerings, one is eligible to perform the agni·π£·π≠oma, the simplest soma rite. After the agni·π£·π≠oma, one is eligible to perform more extensive soma rites and agnicayana rites. ≈örauta brahmins specialise in conducting rituals according to the ≈õruti corpus of texts, in contrast to smarta brahmins, known for conducting rituals according to smriti texts. Women reciting mantras at ≈õrauta ceremonies of Hinduism from ancient times have been suggested by a number of scholars such as Mary McGee, Stephanie Jamison, Katherine Young, and Laurie Patton. =Defunct practices= The Ashvamedha and Rajasuya are not practiced anymore. There is doubt the Purushamedha, a human sacrifice, was ever performed.Oliver Leaman (2006), Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy, Routledge, , page 557, Quote: \\"It should be mentioned that although provision is made for human sacrifice (purusha-medha) this was purely symbolic and did not involve harm to anyone\\". Influence The ≈örauta rituals were complex and expensive, states Robert Bellah, and \\"we should not forget that the rites were created for royalty and nobility\\". A Brahmin, adds Bellah, would need to be very rich to sponsor and incur the expense of an elaborate ≈örauta rite. In ancient times, through the middle of 1st millennium CE, events such as royal consecration sponsored the ≈örauta rites, and thereafter they declined as alternative rites such as temple and philanthropic actions became more popular with the royalty. The Upanishads, states Brian Smith, were a movement towards the demise of the ≈örauta-style social rituals and the worldview these rites represented. The Upanishadic doctrines were not a culmination, but a destruction of Vedic ritualism. This had a lasting influence on the Indian religions that gained prominence in the 1st millennium BCE, not only in terms of the Vedanta and other schools of Hindu philosophy that emerged, but also in terms of Buddhist and Jaina influence among the royal class of the ancient Indian society. With time, scholars of ancient India composed Upanishads, such as the Pranagnihotra Upanishad, that evolved the focus from external rituals to self-knowledge and to inner rituals within man. The Pranagnihotra is, states Henk Bodewitz, an internalized direct private ritual that substituted external public Agnihotra ritual (a srauta rite).Henk Bodewitz (1997), Jaiminƒ´ya BrƒÅhma·πáa I, 1‚Äì65: Translation and Commentary, Brill Academic, , pp. 23, 230‚Äì233 with footnote 6 This evolution hinged on the Vedic idea of devas (gods) referring to the sense organs within one's body, and that the human body is the temple of Brahman, the metaphysical unchanging reality. This principle is found in many Upanishads, including the Pranagnihotra Upanishad, the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad section 2.2,Brihadaranyaka Upanishad Robert Hume (Translator), Oxford University Press, pp. 96‚Äì97 Kaushitaki Upanishad sections 1.4 and 2.1‚Äì2.5,Kausitaki Upanishad Robert Hume (Translator), Oxford University Press, pp. 302‚Äì303, 307‚Äì310, 327‚Äì328 Prasna Upanishad chapter 2,Robert Hume, Prasna Upanishad, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pp. 381The Prasnopanishad with Sri Shankara's Commentary SS Sastri (Translator), pp. 118‚Äì119 and others. The idea is also found and developed by other minor Upanishads such as the ancient Brahma Upanishad which opens by describing human body as the \\"divine city of Brahman\\".Patrick Olivelle (1992), The Samnyasa Upanisads: Hindu Scriptures on Asceticism and Renunciation, Oxford University Press, , pp. 147‚Äì151 Bodewitz states that this reflects the stage in ancient Indian thought where \\"the self or the person as a totality became central, with the self or soul as the manifestation of the highest principle or god\\". This evolution marked a shift in spiritual rite from the external to the internal, from public performance through srauta-like rituals to performance in thought through introspection, from gods in nature to gods within.Henk Bodewitz (1997), Jaiminƒ´ya BrƒÅhma·πáa I, 1‚Äì65: Translation and Commentary, Brill Academic, , pp. 328‚Äì329 The ≈örauta Agnihotra sacrifice thus evolved into Prana-Agnihotra sacrifice concept. Heesterman describes the pranagnihotra sacrifice as one where the practitioner performs the sacrifice with food and his own body as the temple, without any outside help or reciprocity, and this ritual allows the Hindu to \\"stay in the society while maintaining his independence from it\\", its simplicity thus marks the \\"end station of Vedic ritualism\\".

Night Shift titles Night Shift was made by a small independent production company called Addictive TV for the ITV network in the United Kingdom. Each episode of Night Shift lasted only five to ten minutes. The show's original run was from 1992 to 1994, while an additional series was produced in 1998. Several of Night Shift's episodes were filmed at the same location, most notably Gatwick Airport and Victoria Station. The original series featured a highly effective model shot, in which a camera moves across a Monopoly-style map of a city into the title, Night Shift, written as a street name. The shot was produced for a pilot in mid-1992, but utilized in the final shows too. The model was constructed by model-maker Peter Poole, and filmed by Dave Hicks. Despite the slick look, there was no film studio involved: just a Brighton garage. A mini- mist smoke machine was used to add depth to the backlit model, which was about 6 by 4 feet in size. A photo appeared in the design magazine, Creative Review, in the What's New In Design? section. The show, filmed entirely hand-held in a style very common now but not at the time, was presented in a lighthearted and informal fashion by the writer and actor, Colin Bennett. Bennett is also known for his appearance on the BBC children's television show, Take Hart, which was presented by Tony Hart. The short episodes would generally show up at a moment's notice if programmes ran early or it was needed to fill in a small gap. In the latter part of scheduling sometimes two episodes or more would be shown back to back. Colin always appeared sporting an Edmonton Oilers jacket and only removed it once during the entire run. The production crew were often spoken to by the presenter, unusual in those days, with reference to \\"Nick\\" and \\"Graham\\". These names actually refer to producer/sound recordist Nick Clarke and producer/director Graham Daniels of Addictive TV. The crew sometimes appeared on camera with one memorable episode at Gatwick Airport, weighing baggage. The series was shot by award-winning cameraman Nic Small. Highlights from the shows include a late night visit to a cab firm who were not very busy at all and Colin learnt that most of their time was spent playing cards. Escort agencies, hospitals, lap dancing bars, police stations and even nuclear power plants were frequented by the team. An individual episode was filmed entirely using a nightvision camera out in the dark with the army giving it an eerie green glow, long before it would become a staple for series such as Most Haunted. The series was also the first ever television programme allowed to film in Gatwick Airport's control tower (before the BBC series Airport).

History  Founded in 1861, classes were originally given in a suite of upstairs chambers at the Public Assembly Rooms, now the New Theatre. In 1878, the School of Art had moved to a Georgian town house on Albion Street. In 1901, an Anlaby Road site was acquired from the North Eastern Railway Company, and an architectural competition advertised. The winning design for a new Hull School of Art was produced by the Bloomsbury firm of Lanchester, Stewart and Rickards; the building was completed in April 1905. In 1930 the school at Anlaby Road became Hull College of Arts and Crafts. In 1962 the College was renamed the Regional College of Art and Design, and began to offer a syllabus leading to the newly recognised Diploma in Art and Design (DipAD). In 1972 a new Art College Building on Queens Gardens was commissioned, designed by the Architectural Partnership of Frederick Gibberd. This building received its first students in September 1974, and offered honours degrees in Fine Art and Graphic Design. The amalgamation of the local authority's higher education provision commenced in 1976 with the foundation of Hull College of Higher Education. It was later renamed the University of Humberside and entered into alliance with higher education institutions in Lincoln. The resulting University of Lincolnshire and Humberside came into being in 1996, and underwent a further name change in 2001 when it became the University of Lincoln. Renamed as the Hull School of Art and Design, the school is now a part of Hull College Group.

Population figures: History The site of today's Znamensk was originally an Old Prussian fort, with a settlement named Velowe nearby. The site featured an unusually large oak tree, considered sacred by the local Prussians. It survived at least until 1595, when it was mentioned by Caspar Hennenberger. Ruins of St. Jacob's church are one of very few historic landmarks still visible in modern Znamensk Around 1255 the locality was fortified, but the castle was surrendered to the Teutonic Knights by its mayor, Tirslo. The Teutons continued to use the castle and began to colonize the region with Germans, giving the settlement the name Wehlau. It received its civic charter in 1335 and in 1339 and became a centre for horse stables and horse trade. Until the late 19th century the town was allowed to organise a six-day linen fair, a three-day horse fair and two additional horse and cattle fairs every year. In 1349 Grand Master of the Teutonic Order Heinrich Dusemer founded a Franciscan Monastery there to commemorate his victory over the Prussians in the battle of Streba River. In 1380 the St. Jacob's church was erected. In 1454, during the Thirteen Years' War, the castle and the city joined the Kingdom of Poland. However, in 1460 the Teutonic Order besieged the town and successfully retook it. In 1490 Grand Master Johann von Tiefen restored (or founded, the sources are unclear) another Franciscan monastery in the town. However, it was destroyed in 1519 in the course of Protestant Reformation, when the burghers converted to Protestantism and decided that such a small town is not able to bear the burden of sustaining two monasteries. Prussian Confederation offered to incorporate Prussia into the Kingdom of Poland, 1454, Polish Central Archives of Historical Records In 1540 the town was destroyed by a large fire and only the St. Jacob's church was left standing. Wehlau was successfully rebuilt, although natural disasters struck it repeatedly, notably in 1542 and 1593. The town finally recovered and by the end of 16th century Margrave Georg Friedrich considered moving the University of K√∂nigsberg to Wehlau, which however never materialised. In the Treaty of Wehlau signed in the town in 1657, Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, received sovereignty over the Duchy of Prussia. Until World War II the town of Wehlau was known mostly for its horse markets In 1818, it became the seat of Landkreis Wehlau in East Prussia within the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1871 Wehlau joined the German Empire. By the end of the 19th century the town had roughly 4000 inhabitants, mostly German Lutherans. The town had a station of the Prussian Eastern Railway connecting K√∂nigsberg and Berlin to the Saint Petersburg‚ÄìWarsaw Railway, as well as a Lutheran church, a regional courthouse and a school. Near the end of World War II, in 23 January 1945, the town was taken by the Soviet Red Army. The old town center was almost completely destroyed, and the German population fled during the evacuation of East Prussia or expelled. It became part of the Kaliningrad Oblast and was renamed Znamensk, losing its civic rights in the process. It was demoted to a rural settlement in 2006.

The Arch was demolished when the station was rebuilt in the 1960s, but much of the original stone was later located‚Äîprincipally used as fill in the Prescott Channel‚Äîand proposals have been formulated to reconstruct it as part of the planned redevelopment of the station, including the station's use as the London terminus of the High Speed 2 line. When Euston station was redeveloped Drummond Street was split into two parts either side of the station complex, with the eastern half renamed Doric Way, after the style of the arch.  Construction  C.F. Cheffins, published 3 April 1837. Construction of the Euston Arch, London, January 1838, by John Cooke Bourne; reminiscent of David Roberts' drawings of ancient Egypt. Ground plan of Euston station 1838. The grey areas were open granite paving. The Euston Arch is on the left (south) of the plan between its four lodges, forming a grand entrance to the station building, on the departures side of the station Designed by the architect Philip Hardwick, it was inspired by the Roman architecture Hardwick encountered on a trip to Italy in 1818 and 1819. Strictly speaking it was not an arch at all, but a propylaeum of the Doric order. The sandstone structure was designed for the London and Birmingham Railway (L&BR;), complementing Birmingham Curzon Street station, at the other end of the company's mainline. The arch was to be not only a fitting gateway to the Midlands, but to the whole new world which the railway was to open up. The construction of the arch was announced by the directors of the L&BR; in a report dated February 1837: The arch was supported on four columns, and bronze gates were placed behind them. It stood and , while the diameter of each of the columns was . The structure was built from stone from Bramley in West Yorkshire, and cost ¬£35,000. Initially it had very little embellishment and no descriptive title until 1870, when the London and North Western Railway incised \\"Euston\\" on the architrave in letters of gold. There were two lodges on each side of the arch, executed like it in strictly classical style. Each of these lodges was separated from its neighbour by an imposing pair of bronze gates. One of the gates between the lodges operated as an entrance for carriages and very heavy goods going by train, while one of the lodges was an office for outgoing parcels. The traveller would drive through the arch into an oblong courtyard running north to south and enclosed by a brick wall nearly and . On the eastern side (the arriving traveller's right) was a range of offices behind a colonnade of pillars. The arch was not admired by everyone in its early years. A guide to London published at the time of the Great Exhibition in 1851 described it as \\"gigantic and very absurd\\", and placed \\"without reference to the courtyard it leads to\\". The British Almanac for 1839 remarked that it was \\"noble\\", emphasising the purity of its style, but stated that \\"it was not necessary, as in the case of many porticoes to country houses, to have sash windows peeping out between Doric columns; the perfection of the style could be maintained and should be appreciated.\\" The addition of the station name was part of station improvements in 1869‚Äì74 which also saw the creation of an entrance drive from the Euston Road to the portico. In 1881, however, the westernmost pier and lodge of the arch structure were demolished to make way for offices, and soon afterwards a hotel extension blocked the view from Euston Road.  Removal  = 1938 proposal = A suggestion to move the arch was made in 1938 by the London Midland & Scottish Railway (LMS), which proposed rebuilding Euston Station according to an American-inspired design by Percy Thomas, a respected architect hired with the help of a loan provided by the government. After returning from a tour of modern stations in the United States, Thomas proposed a large stripped-Classical block with wings, which incorporated a hotel, offices and the station. This plan involved removing the Euston Arch. Gerald Wellesley and Albert Richardson of the Georgian Group, a conservation organisation, managed to persuade Lord Stamp, chairman of the LMS, that it could be resited on the Euston Road, even though Thomas had insisted that it would not be possible to move it. Ultimately these plans for reconstruction were never realised as the Second World War began the following year. = 1960 proposal = In January 1960 the British Transport Commission served the London County Council (LCC) (the local planning authority) with notice of its intention to demolish Euston station. Conceived in the context of the BTC's plans to upgrade and electrify the main line between Euston and Scotland as part of its Modernisation Programme, the proposal called for the demolition of the entire station, including the arch and the Great Hall, which were both Grade II listed buildings. The existing station was regarded as inconveniently sited and impractically small. At a planning inquiry held in late January 1960, the LCC adopted a report by its Town Planning Committee which allowed the removal of the arch and its attendant lodges on condition that they would be \\"re-erected on another site in an appropriate dignified and open setting.\\" Giving evidence to the LCC, the BTC estimated that the re- siting costs would be in the region of ¬£180,000. It refused to countenance any suggestion that it would fund the work. In the House of Commons, the MP Woodrow Wyatt tabled a motion demanding that the arch as well as the Great Hall and Shareholders' Room in the station should be retained. Under the legislation governing the planning procedure, once the BTC's notice to demolish had expired on 17 April 1960, only the Minister of Housing and Local Government could save the buildings by placing a preservation order on them. In default of the Minister's action, the station would be demolished. = Royal Fine Art Commission = In 1960 the Royal Fine Art Commission, the body responsible for advising on questions of \\"public amenity or of artistic importance\\", asked both the BTC and the LCC to consult it. Local planning authorities are 'advised' to seek the Commission's advice on development schemes of national or major regional importance, and the Commission will make non-binding recommendations as to the proposed development from the perspective of its impact on the local environment and its design quality. The BTC referred the Commission to the LCC which itself avoided the issue by stating that it was for the Ministry of Housing and Local Government to call- in the planning application. The Ministry refused to act, stating that it still remained for the LCC to deal with the application. In May 1960 Henry Brooke, the Conservative Minister for Housing and Local Government, was asked to issue a Building Preservation Order in respect of the arch under Section 29 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. This would prevent any works being carried out without the permission of the LCC. He rejected the request, believing that an Order was unnecessary given that the LCC was in discussions with the BTC on the future of the arch. The Royal Fine Art Commission contacted the Minister in June 1960 expressing their concern for the arch, and again requested to be consulted on the proposals for redevelopment of the station site. The Minister did not reply to this letter. = Decision = On 12 July 1961, in a written answer to a Parliamentary question by Sir Frank Markham, https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/written- answers/1961/jul/12/euston-station-doric-arch> the Minister of Transport, Ernest Marples, confirmed that he had given approval to the early reconstruction of Euston station which, in his view, was urgent not only because of the electrification programme but also because three 50-year-old Underground lifts had almost reached the end of their useful lives. The replacement of the lifts would cost ¬£700,000. As he recounted, The arch did not, in his view, justify such expenditure, and although he expressed his regret at the passing of a major monument of the early railway age, there was no practical alternative in his mind. = Reaction and last-minute lobbying = The breakers moved in on 6 November 1961. This photograph was taken on a wet 12 February 1962. When the new 'Great Hall' had been completed in 1968 it was found that there was plenty of room after all. The arch's imminent demolition sparked a preservation protest in which Woodrow Wyatt, John Betjeman and Nikolaus Pevsner were prominent figures, and a wider debate about the modernisation of central London. There was public disquiet over how a local authority with a good track record for architecture and town planning such as the LCC, and the BTC, an important public service operator, could allow the demolition of such an important monument. Figures such as Sir Charles Wheeler, the President of the Royal Academy, backed by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, the Georgian Group and the London Society, lobbied in vain for the arch's preservation. Arguments which had been successfully employed to see off the previous attempted demolition in 1938 failed to sway the BTC which said that it was unable to afford the costs of reconstruction. The Victorian Society, whose vice-chairman was Sir John Betjeman, attempted to raise ¬£90,000 to pay for the relocation of the arch, and pleaded for a stay of execution for the arch until this had been done. A Canadian firm, Nicholas Brothers, had offered to move the portico on rollers to a site 200 yards nearer the Euston Road. It was reported in October 1961 that a promise had been received that the gates of the arch would be preserved and moved elsewhere on the railways. On 24 October 1961, a group of campaigners including J. M. Richards, the editor of the Architectural Review, went to see Harold Macmillan, the Conservative Prime Minister, to plead for the preservation of the arch, arguing that if it really had to be moved, that it should be dismantled and re-erected elsewhere. As J. M. Richards recalled, \\"Macmillan listened ‚Äì or I suppose he listened [...] he sat without moving with his eyes apparently closed. He asked no questions; in fact he said nothing except that he would consider the matter.\\" Two weeks later Macmillan gave his response to the proposals. He stated that he had decided against adopting the suggested preservation strategy, and explained that \\"every possible way\\" of preserving the arch had been investigated by the BTC, but the lack of available land, the operational requirements of the station and the removal costs entailed made the project infeasible. He revealed that the only place the arch could be put where it would not look \\"incongruous\\" was the traffic roundabout on the Euston Road, a possibility which had been considered unsuitable by the LCC. He refused to allow any further delay or to allow the Victorian Society time to raise funds, for that would delay the reconstruction of the station and involve extra expenditure of ¬£100,000. A group of young architects had attempted to delay demolition by climbing the scaffolding around the arch and erecting a 50 ft long banner with the inscription \\"save the arch\\" on it. Sir John Summerson was also present at the demonstration. = Demolition = Demolition began in December 1961. Leonard Fairclough Limited of Adlington in Lancashire were appointed as demolition contractors. The company revealed that it would take several weeks to demolish the arch, as the job would have to be done by hand ‚Äî explosives being out of the question owing to possible damage to the adjacent buildings. = Criticism = The Architectural Review criticised the cynical means employed by British Railways in achieving the demolition of the arch: Frank Valori, a representative of Leonard Fairclough Ltd., later revealed to Lord Esher that he had undertaken the demolition \\"without pleasure\\" and had offered to provide the Government with an alternative site at his own expense at which he would store the stones of the portico with a view to re-erecting it elsewhere. This offer was \\"disdainfully rejected by the Government on the flimsy pretext that no place could ever be found.\\" Valori presented a silver model of the arch to Lord Esher who admitted that the gesture \\"made him feel as if some man had murdered his wife and then presented him with her bust\\". Valori later incorporated part of the arch into the stonework of the house which he had constructed for himself in Bromley. The campaign to preserve the arch was a significant factor in the development of Industrial Archaeology as a distinct discipline.  Remains of the Arch  The main gates from the Euston Arch, now in the care of the National Railway Museum, York A part of one of the columns is recovered from the Prescott Channel in 1994 The ornamental iron gates from the Arch were saved at the time of demolition and are now in the National Railway Museum in York. In 1994 the historian Dan Cruickshank discovered that at least 60% of the stone from the Arch was buried in the bed of the River Lea at the Prescott Channel in the East End of London. The location of the stones, for which he had been searching for 15 years, had been revealed by Bob Cotton, a British Waterways engineer, who had acquired the material in 1962 to fill a chasm in the bed of the channel. Cruickshank revealed on the One Foot in the Past television programme, broadcast on 7 June 1994, that the stone had barely weathered at all. As he explained, \\"This makes the reconstruction of the arch a tangible reality, [...] The arch is made of stone from the Bramley Fall quarry in Yorkshire which is incredibly hard, almost like granite.\\" A section of fluted column was brought up from the river bed, where the stones with \\"Euston\\" marked in gold lettering are believed to be located. Other stones are lying in the gardens of those involved in the arch's demolition. The television programme showed at least one large piece being part of the rear wall of a large rockery in one garden. In May 2009 British Waterways raised many more stones from the Prescott Channel, in conjunction with work to repair waterways serving the Olympic Park. A Fuller's pub in the new station, named The Doric Arch after Euston arch, has a display of some of the recovered stone behind the bar.  Reconstruction plans  In 1996 Dan Cruickshank launched the Euston Arch Trust, an organisation dedicated to the rebuilding of the arch, which counted among its members the modernist architects Peter Smithson (who with his wife Alison had written a history of the arch) and Piers Gough. The trustees saw the opportunity to put right a historical wrong whilst at the same time addressing the fragmented townscape around Euston, including possibly the restoration of Euston Square which was laid out in the early nineteenth century but fell victim to the re-development of Euston Station in 1968. Railtrack were reported to be 'keen' on the idea of reconstructing the arch and the London Borough of Camden were said to have 'no case against revival'. The estimated cost of rebuilding in 1996 was said to be ¬£5 million. On 6 November 2007 the historian Tristram Hunt reported in The Guardian newspaper that a project to rebuild the arch as part of the redevelopment of Euston Station could be led by Alastair Lansley, the lead architect for the reconstruction and rebuilding of St Pancras Station. On 18 February 2008 Marcus Binney reported in The Times newspaper that the Arch may be rebuilt as part of the redevelopment of Euston Station from 2009. In September 2009 the Euston Arch Trust revealed detailed plans to rebuild the Arch in front of Euston Station, between a pair of existing lodges on Euston Road (see right). It was reported that lettable space in the Arch could help pay the cost of construction, now estimated at ¬£10 million. The Trust suggests this might involve a 'banqueting room' at the top of the Arch and a 'nightclub' in the basement.Cruickshank plans to reconstruct Euston Arch Building on line, 21 September 2009 In March 2014 it was announced that a revived ¬£1.2bn scheme to rebuild London‚Äôs Euston station as the gateway to the High Speed 2 line might include reconstruction of the Euston Arch. The Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: \\"I will ... ask HS2 Ltd and Network Rail to develop more comprehensive proposals for the redevelopment of Euston, working with the rail industry and the local community.

Rather unknown to the public, it was held for Colleges of Engineering student teams who built and designed these vehicles which were able to reach speeds up to and competed on both oval and road course type race tracks. Each participant in the Formula Lightning series purchased an identical rolling chassis, then designed and built the electric drive system for their vehicle. There were no changes allowed in the chassis design without majority approval of the Formula Lightning Owners Association. This ensured student teams could concentrate on the electric drive without the necessity of designing specialized mechanical chassis components. These vehicles raced first in 1994 at the Grand Prix of Cleveland CART race with the University of Notre Dame winning the event and since then have participated in venues across the country. The final official series race was held in October 2004 at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course. The Ohio State University was the leading series champion.

Located at the western foot of Black Mountain and bounded on two sides by nature park, the suburb is characterised by its bush setting. During the planning and development of the suburb, a large proportion of large native trees ‚Äì predominantly eucalypts ‚Äì were left in place. The suburb derives its name from the Arrernte tribe of Central Australia, previously known as Arunta, which means 'White Cockatoo'. The streets in Aranda are named after Aboriginal tribal groups from around Australia. The suburb comprises an area of 160ha and in 1967 was the first suburb in Belconnen to be settled. A small plaque at the Aranda District playing fields near the suspension bridge over Belconnen Way marks the settlement of the suburb as the first development in the Belconnen district. It reads: Location Suspension footbridge over Belconnen Way connecting Aranda with Bruce. Aranda is located in the south east of Belconnen. It is bounded by Caswell Drive on the east, separating the suburb from Black Mountain Nature Park, Belconnen Way to the north, Bindubi Street to the west and Aranda Bushland to the south. A pedestrian bridge crossing the six-lane Belconnen Way connects the suburb with the suburb of Bruce to the north. The suburbs of Cook and Macquarie are located to Aranda‚Äôs west on the opposite side of Bindubi Street. Aranda is located 4 km to the west of Civic along Belconnen Way. Bandjalong Crescent, a curved bell shaped street is the main street passing through the suburb, connecting Caswell Drive with Bindubi Street. A number of community facilities are located in the centre of the curve. Transport A bicycle path along Bindubi Street connects Aranda with the Canberra bike path network. A walking path runs through a reserve along the spine of the suburb and connects with the footbridge to the suburb of Bruce. A walking track over Black Mountain connects Aranda with the CSIRO and the Australian National University. Aranda is served by ACTION bus route 32 which connects to Civic via Barry Drive and to Belconnen Town Centre via Cook and Macquarie.Route 32 Transport Canberra Buses to/from Belconnen also stop at or near Calvary Hospital, located in Bruce but easily accessible from Aranda by crossing Belconnen Way at the Haydon Drive T-intersection. Facilities A number of community facilities are located close to one another near the intersections of Bandjalong and Bindel Streets. These include two primary schools (Aranda Primary School and St. Vincent's Catholic school), two churches and a pre-school. Aranda has a local set of shops. The Aranda shops were left vacant for many years but have recently been leased, a cafe and bar has opened, with outdoor seating. The nearby Jamison Centre in neighbouring Macquarie services the area on a much larger scale, including supermarkets, retail and medical outlets, banks and cafes. A number of playing fields are located in the north western corner of the suburb including baseball and soccer fields, as is a Scout hall. A nursing home was located on Bindel Street, but it closed in 2015. The Belconnen Ambulance and Fire & Rescue Station, a co-located facility, opened in September 2016 with their former premises in the nearby suburb of Belconnen closing. Community activity Due to its setting in a bush environment and the interest expressed by its residents, Canberra‚Äôs first Community Fire Unit was established in Aranda in 2003 . The programme provides Aranda residents with training and fire fighting equipment to fight bushfires in their suburb. The Friends of Aranda Bushland group is active in the suburb. The Aranda Residents Group (ARG) is association number A03227 on the ACT register of It is active in representing the interests of its residents on such major planning issues as the Gungahlin Drive Extension, residential development issues, the Emergency Services Station on Aranda Oval (opened 2016), and redevelopment of the Aranda Shops. *The Gungahlin Drive Extension, completed in 2011, is a four lane road connecting Gungahlin Drive in Gungahlin with Parkes Way near Lake Burley Griffin. The road follows the route of Caswell Drive, separating Black Mountain reserve from Aranda.  Political representation  For the purposes of Australian federal elections for the House of Representatives, Aranda is in the Division of Canberra. For the purposes of Australian Capital Territory elections for the ACT Legislative Assembly, Aranda is in the Ginninderra electorate. Geology Aranda is built on top of rocks from the Pittman Formation. These are from the upper Ordovician Age. Mostly the rocks are greywacke formed on a continental slope, but also have bands of the Acton Shale Member, a grey to black laminated shale. The Acton Shale contains graptolites.

The tourist center of Bariloche is on the southern shore of the lake. The June 2011 eruption of the Puyehue-Cord√≥n Caulle volcanic complex, in neighboring Chile, caused parts of the lake's surface to be blanketed in volcanic ash. During the Last Glacial Maximum of the Llanquihue glaciation the lake basin was wholly occupied by a glacier. Etymology The name of the lake derives from the toponym of its major island in Mapudungun (Mapuche language): \\"Island of Puma\\", from nahuel, \\"puma\\", and huap√≠, \\"island\\". There is, however, more to the word \\"Nahuel\\" - it can also signify \\"a man who by sorcery has been transformed to a puma\\". Geography Lake Nahuel Huapi. The surrounding area became Argentina's first National Park in 1903 Lake Nahuel Huapi from space (the elongated, dark feature in the center of the image is the lake and in the bottom is seen the Limay River), North is to the right of the image, 1997. Nahuel Huapi lake, located within the Nahuel Huapi National Park, has a surface of , rests above the sea level, and has a maximum measured depth (as of 2007) of . The lake depression consists of several glacial valleys carved out along faults and Miocene valleys that were later dammed by moraines. Its seven branches are named Blest (36 km¬≤), Huemul (21.5 km¬≤), de la Tristeza (18.5 km¬≤), Campanario (7.9 km¬≤), Machete, del Rinc√≥n and √öltima Esperanza. It is connected to other smaller lakes such as Guti√©rrez, Moreno, Espejo and Correntoso. The deep-blue waters hold a number of islands, most notably Isla Victoria with an area of 31 km¬≤, and Isla Huemul. A curious fact about the lake is that, despite being nowhere near any ocean and being at high altitude, it is also home for kelp gull and the blue eyed cormorant (Phalacrocorax atriceps), otherwise strictly marine birds.Pamela C. Rasmussen The Condor Vol. 88, No. 3 (Aug., 1986), pp. 393-395. University of California Press The lake‚Äôs crystal clear waters are very susceptible to climate changes and have an average surface temperature of 45 ¬∞F (7 ¬∞C); this makes it both beautiful and treacherous. Hypothermia is one of the risks bathers must undertake. Kayaking is a popular sport on this and adjacent lakes. The lake is also the starting point of the Limay River. Fauna This lake harbors several introduced, non- native species of trout, including rainbow trout, brown trout and brook trout which attract anglers from the world over. Nahuelito At the beginning of the 20th century, and following an old aboriginal legend, the rumor of a giant creature living in the deep waters of the lake took up. The creature is known locally as Nahuelito. Reported sightings of it predate Nessie and The Lost World (Arthur Conan Doyle). Local aborigines (Mapuche) called another creature el Cuero (leather) for its smooth skin. The neighboring lake Lago L√°car, has also been the site for accounts of another creature, more consistent with a plesiosaur, with aborigines describing it as a sea-cow with teeth all around it. Members of the Buenos Aires Zoo visited the lake in 1922 trying to corroborate the reports of sightings of the prehistoric animal, but found no evidence to support the theory of such a creature. Hitler conspiracy theory The Inalco House near the current settlement of Villa La Angostura. According to the fringe theory of Abel Basti, Hitler would have lived some years here after 1945. In his 2004 book Bariloche nazi-gu√≠a tur√≠stica, Argentine author Abel Basti claims that Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun lived in the surroundings of Bariloche for many years after World War II. Basti said that the Argentine Nazis chose the estate of Inalco as Hitler's refuge. In his 2004 book Bariloche nazi-gu√≠a tur√≠stica, Argentine author Abel Basti suggests that Hitler and Braun did not commit suicide, but actually escaped to Argentina. The scenario proposed by the two authors is as follows: > A number of U-boats took certain Nazis and Nazi loot to Argentina, where the > Nazis were supported by future president Juan Per√≥n, who, with his wife > \\"Evita\\", had been receiving money from the Nazis for some time. Hitler > allegedly arrived in Argentina, first staying at Hacienda San Ram√≥n, east of > San Carlos de Bariloche.

History Although the present Shap Abbey was built in 1199, the monastic community was founded on another site 20 miles south near Kendal in 1190, but it moved to the present site, then called 'Hepp', in 1199. The old name meant 'a heap' but it gradually assumed the present-day name \\"Shap\\" over the next 100 years. One of the abbots was the impressive Richard Redman (died 1505), later successively Bishop of St Asaph (c. 1471), Bishop of Exeter (1495), and Bishop of Ely (1501). He is remembered by a magnificent funeral monument in Ely Cathedral Shap Abbey escaped the initial phase of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536, but it was closed in 1540 and subsequently sold to the Governor of Carlisle. Most of the abbey buildings have been demolished, however the tower remains are still impressive, and the outline of the building plan is clearly visible. Masonry was robbed away at the end of the 17th century to build Shap Market Hall, and much of the ornate carved stonework was also removed and used in the building of Lowther Castle.

Life Edwin Lord Weeks in his studio. Weeks was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1849. His parents were affluent spice and tea merchants from Newton, a suburb of Boston, and as such they were able to finance their son's youthful interest in painting and travelling. As a young man Weeks visited the Florida Keys to draw, and also travelled to Surinam in South America. His earliest known paintings date from 1867 when he was eighteen years old, although it is not until his Landscape with Blue Heron, dated 1871 and painted in the Everglades, that Weeks started to exhibit a dexterity of technique and eye for composition‚Äîpresumably having taken professional tuition. In 1872 Weeks relocated to Paris, becoming a pupil of L√©on Bonnat and Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me.Telfair Museum of Art., & McCullough, H. K. (2005). Telfair Museum of Art: Collection highlights. Savannah, Ga: Telfair Museum of Art. p. 102. . After his studies in Paris, Weeks emerged as one of America's major painters of Orientalist subjects. Throughout his adult life he was an inveterate traveler and journeyed to South America (1869), Egypt and Persia (1870), Morocco (frequently between 1872 and 1878), and India (1882‚Äì83). In 1895 Weeks wrote and illustrated a book of travels, From the Black Sea through Persia and India, and in 1897 he published Episodes of Mountaineering (which was preceded by the 1894 article Some Episodes of Mountaineering, by a Casual Amateur). Weeks died in Paris in November 1903. He was a member of the L√©gion d'honneur, France, an officer of the Order of Saint Michael (Bavaria), and a member of the Munich Secession. Achievements Weeks exhibited his work in nearly every annual Salon (Paris). He earned a Medal of Honor in 1884, then a Third Class Medal in 1889, followed by a Gold Medal at the 1889 International Exhibition, and finally the Legion of Honor in 1896.

He did play however during two months (April‚ÄìMay 2005) for lowly K.F.C. Verbroedering Geel. International career De Wilde was on squad for the Belgian national team in three FIFA World Cups: 1990, 1994 and 1998. He played the first of his 33 games with the Red Devils against Denmark in a 1989 friendly, coming on as a substitute for Gilbert Bodart at half-time. In the first two World Cups, De Wilde acted as backup to legendary Michel Preud'homme but, after the latter's retirement he became first-choice, playing in the 1998 edition. His last international appearance was a sour one, as the match against Turkey at the UEFA Euro 2000 was lost by the hosts 0‚Äì2 and he was sent off with seven minutes to go (previously, he hesitated and lost the ball to opposing striker Hakan ≈û√ºk√ºr, who opened the scoresheet), as Belgium was eliminated in the first round. Coaching career Upon retiring in June De Wilde immediately rejoined former side Anderlecht, as a goalkeeping coach. De Wilde began working with the Belgian under-21s in 2012, still as a goalkeeper coach.

He is also the husband of Sayd. Fictional character biography Ganthet is one of the Guardians of the Universe, but much less stern and 'by- the-book' than most of these colleagues, showing a human-like, and less stern, personality by displays of empathy, kindness, and concern for individuals, rather than thinking only of the Green Lantern Corps. In such DC crossover limited series such as Kingdom Come, this particular Guardian is presented as being part of the Quintessence, a group of gods who oversee their entire universe (or multiverse), yet shows signs of focusing especially on Earth. Although he has been portrayed much as are the other Guardians, he is often distinguished by tying his hair into a long ponytail, in contrast to the shorter and unkempt hair of other male Guardians. =Green Lantern: Secret Origin= In the Green Lantern: Secret Origin story, Ganthet (without ever revealing himself physically) asks Sinestro to investigate the death of Abin Sur (through a non-official channel, bypassing protocol); this leads to Sinestro first meeting, on Earth, with Hal Jordan.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #30 (April 2008) =Ganthet's Tale= The graphic novel Ganthet's Tale by John Byrne (expanded from a story by Larry Niven) tells the story of Hal Jordan's first encounters with Ganthet. Jordan is asked to help him battle the renegade Guardian Dawlakispokpok (nicknamed ‚ÄúDawly‚Äú), who is trying to use a time machine to change history. In the early era of the planet Oa, a scientist named Krona had attempted to use a device to see the beginning of time, and in using his time machine, somehow -- so to speak -- ‚Äòbled‚Äô the universe of a billion years of its potential duration. Dawly is going to use another time machine to thrust Krona to the end of time, to prevent his following through with that plan; however, in battling Dawly, he learns that Dawly is responsible for the mishap of the universe being 'born old'. When Dawly's family is brought before the Guardians, Ganthet shields Jordan's mind, allowing him to retain his memory of one of the biggest secrets of the Guardians. = Emerald Twilight = After the destruction of Coast City (in the \\"Reign of the Supermen\\" storyline),Green Lantern (vol. 3) #46 (October 1993) the subsequent \\"insanity\\" of Hal Jordan, and the destruction of the Main Power Battery, the Guardians decide to focus all of their remaining power into Ganthet, recognising that he was the only one of them to foresee a catastrophe like Hal Jordan's current attack on them. As such, he becomes the last Guardian. Ganthet creates a new Green Lantern ring from Jordan's ring (which was crushed by the former Green Lantern after murdering Sinestro), and goes to Earth. He appears before Kyle Rayner and hastily hands him the ring, muttering \\"You shall have to do\\".Green Lantern (vol. 3) #50 (March 1994) Guy Gardner later claimed that Ganthet first went to him, but he had turned down Ganthet‚Äôs plan. During Rayner's first few months as Green Lantern, Ganthet is unsatisfied with Rayner, and attempts to take back the ring.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #62 (May 1995) Rayner eventually earns the respect of Ganthet by facing Parallax, without his ring.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #64 (July 1995) = The Quintessence = Ganthet became part of the circle of gods, including (usually) Shazam, Zeus, Highfather, and Phantom Stranger, committed to observing the universe and counseling one another.I don't know when Ganthet became a part of The Quintessence, but in Day of Judgment storyline, he was shown as one of the group observing the chaos on Earth. =Ion and the new Guardians= When Rayner briefly became the godlike Ion, he possessed more power than Hal Jordan did as Parallax.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #144 (January 2002) Realizing that he could not continue as Ion without losing his humanity, Kyle traveled to the recently restored Oa to recharge the Central Power Battery. By doing so, he created a new set of Guardians, this time as small children (both male and female), with the intent that Ganthet, as their \\"father figure,\\" will look after them and teach them how to be better Guardians than their predecessors. After one of the children, Lianna, went missing and was later revealed to have aged prematurely, Ganthet invited the Zamarons to Oa to help raise them with him. When the Martian Manhunter reverted to the 'Burning Martian' identity that the Guardians of the Universe had locked away long ago and attacked the Justice League, Ganthet teleported John Stewart to safety and treated his injuries when the rest of the League teleported to the Fortress of Solitude to escape the Burning's initial attack.JLA #86 (November 2003) Ganthet was later able to tell John the history of the Burning Martians and teach him a way to 'reroute' his mind to think in the first language of the universe so that he could rescue his teammates from Fernus in a hit-and-run attack (Although the intensity of this method of thought meant that John could not use it for more than sixty seconds without burning his mind out), allowing them to come up with a plan to defeat Fernus.JLA #87 (November 2003) =Green Lantern: Rebirth= Ganthet played a crucial role in resurrecting Hal Jordan, who was revealed to be possessed by the fear entity Parallax during Green Lantern: Rebirth. Following the return of Hal Jordan, all the Guardians are aged to adulthood and are just as cold and manipulative as before. The only change is that there are now female Guardians as well as male. Ganthet, of course still retains a sense of individuality amongst the Guardians, believing that they should retain their emotions; Sayd is the only other Guardian who shares his mindset. =Sinestro Corps War= During the Sinestro Corps War he and Sayd are banished from the council for embracing emotions, discovering that they have romantic feelings for each other.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #23 (September 2007) Just as Parallax (freed from any hosts) attacks the Lanterns for freeing Kyle Rayner, Ganthet and Sayd arrive and draw Parallax into four separate lanterns (Hal, Kyle, John, and Guy's, respectively), reasoning that the Earth Lanterns had proven their superior ability to overcome fear and the division would prevent anyone from being able to release Parallax again. As Ganthet explains, he and Sayd were kicked out of the Guardians of the Universe. Ganthet's final act as Guardian is offering Kyle his power ring. He asks if Kyle is willing to downgrade himself to a normal Green Lantern, which Kyle quickly accepts. The four men then take their lanterns and hearing the Sinestro Corps oath, recite the Classic Green Lantern Oath, and depart to confront Sinestro's Corps.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #24 (October 2007) Ganthet and Sayd also explain to the four about the emotional spectrum created at the start of the universe that is separated into seven colors: green (willpower), yellow (fear), violet (love), red (rage), indigo (compassion), orange (greed), and blue (hope), each representing different forms of emotion, with green being the most center balanced of the energies. The further at one end an energy color is, the wilder its power is to control. The energy ends up corrupting its user. Ganthet also reveals that in the coming future, each color will have its own forces like the Lantern Corps, and these forces will fight against the others in a battle across the universe that will lead into the event known as \\"The Blackest Night\\", the worst of the hidden prophecies of the Book of Oa.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #25 (December 2007) =Blackest Night= At the end of the Sinestro Corps War, Ganthet and Sayd are currently living on the planet Odym. They harness the blue energy of hope and make plans to create another intergalactic police force in order to aid the Guardians and the Green Lantern Corps in their upcoming battle against \\"The Blackest Night\\". The first of the Blue Lanterns is an alien named Saint Bro'Dee Walker or Saint Walker. The second is Warth, an elephant like alien from Sector Two. According to Saint Walker, Warth will select another candidate from a different sector of space and the process will continue from there.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #36 (February 2008) Later, Ganthet reveals to the Blue Lantern Corps that he and Sayd are planning to create an alliance to those who wield the indigo power of compassion along with Oa.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #39 (March 2009) However, Ganthet, Sayd, and the Blue Lanterns find themselves being attacked by Agent Orange as the villain seeks the powers they possess; Larfleeze desires anything he does not have.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #42 (June 2009) They were eventually rescued by Hal Jordan, accompanied by Sinestro, Carol Ferris, and Indigo Tribe member Indigo-1.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #47 (October 2009) Ganthet and Sayd then seek Atrocitus and Larfleeze's aid to recreate the \\"white light of creation\\" with their saviors. In order to get Larfleeze to cooperate with them, Sayd offers her servitude to Agent Orange, who expresses a desire of having his own Guardian over Ganthet's protests. Ganthet and Sayd later arrive at Coast City with the Lanterns to aid Earth's heroes. They also try to free the Guardians from the Black Central Battery.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #48 (January 2010)Blackest Night #5 (January 2010) Failing that, Ganthet duplicates Hal Jordan's ring and places it on his own finger, inducting himself into the Green Lantern Corps. He and Sayd also duplicate the other Lantern Rings, allowing the other six corps to gain temporary 'deputies' to fight alongside the seven already present until the rest of the Corps can arrive. As a result, Lex Luthor becomes an Orange Lantern. Wonder Woman- after being freed from the influence of her Black Lantern ring- becomes a Star Sapphire. Barry Allen becomes a Blue Lantern. Scientist Ray Palmer becomes an Indigo Tribesman. Mera becomes a Red Lantern, and Scarecrow becomes a Sinestro Corps officer.Blackest Night #6 (February 2010) =Brightest Day= After the Blackest Night is over, Ganthet is seen plotting with Atrocitus and Guy Gardner a new, universe-saving plan against a new, hidden foe. To further advance his new cause, Ganthet renounces his Guardian status, requesting his fellow Oans to fill in the permanent post of Green Lantern of Sector 0, forging his own lantern and power ring in the process. Notably, his new Power Battery lacks the ordinary, rounder design, and looks much similar to the squared, older ones once wielded by the Manhunters and the Halla's. He was later forced to assist Hank Henshaw, who has learned from the hidden foe that Ganthet is apparently the key to Henshaw's permanent death.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #50 (July 2010) By threatening to make the Alpha Lanterns kill themselves if Ganthet does not cooperate, Henshaw made Ganthet operate several Alpha Lanterns to try and restore them to organic life-forms, believing that the process, once perfected, can be used to return him to a mortal body.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #51 (August 2010) During the process, some Alpha Lanterns perished. Ganthet experiences great grief at the death of these Green Lanterns, emotions he is not quite familiar with. Ganthet was rescued by a squad of Lanterns and Hank Henshaw's form and spirit were destroyed. Afterward, all the Alpha Lanterns have their free will restored as well, thanks to Ganthet. Sadly, they must keep their cyborg appearances.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #52 (September 2010) Ganthet brings up more blood, which transforms into Atrocitus' head, who reveals their alliance. Ganthet is forced to admit to his fellow Lanterns that a short time ago that formed into a tapestry of future events, and that, having learned that Atrocitus had the same thing happen to him, he and Guy entered into their alliance.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #55 (December 2010) =War of the Green Lanterns= With Krona having returned Parallax to the Green Lantern power battery and infecting the other six remaining Guardians with the other emotional entities, Ganthet, Kilowog, and the four Earth-based Green Lanterns are the only ones even partly immune to Parallax's influence due to their prior experience under his influence, but he is still forced to take Kyle and John's rings when they are driven to attack each other. Unfortunately, when Ganthet takes their rings and his own, the three rings explode, destroying his hand, forcing John to bandage the amputated limb. With the other Green Lanterns searching for them, Ganthet orders John and Kyle to depart while he uses his own Guardian-based powers to draw the Lanterns away.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #58 (March 2011) Despite the odds against them, the four Earth Lanterns were able to rescue Ganthet from Krona using the rings of the other six Corps: Hal wielding Sinestro's ring, John Indigo-1's, Kyle Saint Walker's and Guy Atrocitus, Ganthet later advising Hal and Guy to use Larfleeze and Carol's rings respectively to remove Parallax from the Central Power Battery to free the other Green Lanterns from his influence.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #59 (April 2011) Ganthet was also able to help Guy master both of his rings by encouraging him to tap into something that he loved and something that he hated.Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors #10 (May 2011) Afterward, Ganthet is visited by Saint Walker, who restores his hand. His blue ring shows Ganthet an image of Sayd, revealing that he still misses her.War of the Green Lanterns: Aftermath #1 (July 2011) =The New 52= Following the War of the Green Lanterns storyline, to compensate for the new shortage of Guardians, the other Guardians strip Ganthet of his emotions so that he will rejoin their ranks.Green Lantern (vol. 5) #1 (November 2011) Kyle Rayner comes to Oa for help after something has turned him into a 'ring magnet', causing rings from the other six Corps to try and latch on to him. Kyle likens Ganthet's transformation to a lobotomy, though Ganthet himself disputes this because \\"my cognitive abilities are unimpaired.\\" Kyle then compares the process to taking away Ganthet's soul, as he is now nothing more than another Guardian: a charge to which Ganthet does not respond.Green Lantern: New Guardians #2 (October 2011) After Kyle is briefly overwhelmed by the other rings he wields, Kyle's green ring throws Ganthet aside when he attempts to remove it. As the other Lanterns attempt to help Kyle, Saint Walker appeals to Ganthet for help, but Ganthet simply throws Walker off, now regarding the Blue Lantern Corps as a mistake that must be rectified.Green Lantern: New Guardians #3 (November 2011) Ganthet's dismissive attitude towards his past remains even when Sayd is revealed to be accompanying Larfleeze's attack, although he appears to retain a degree of affection for Kyle, as he offers Kyle a chance to return to the Green Lantern Corps if he agrees to remain on Oa so that the consequences of his temporary period wielding the other six rings can be studied. However, hearing Sayd tell him that the Ganthet they knew will be gone forever if Kyle goes with him now, Kyle rejects Ganthet and escapes with the other ring-wielders, stating that, while he may consider Ganthet a father, he has to do things his way.Green Lantern: New Guardians #4 (December 2011) It is later revealed that Ganthet told the other Guardians that during his time as a Green Lantern, he found the Corps, like the Manhunters, has serious flaws because of the disobedience of Green Lanterns like Hal Jordan or Sinestro, and announces that it is time to replace the Green Lantern Corps with the \\"Third Army\\".Green Lantern (vol. 5) #3 (January 2012) Although the 'New Guardians' go their separate ways when it is revealed that Sayd brought them together by drawing rings from weaker wielders to Kyle Rayner due to his connection to Ganthet,Green Lantern: New Guardians #12 (August 2012) Kyle is apparently still trying to recruit other ring-wielders together in an attempt to rescue Ganthet and restore him to what he was, even as Ganthet himself states that he considers the Guardians as having 'saved' him rather than the other way around.Green Lantern (vol. 5) #12 (August 2012) Ganthet arrives on Zamaron to attack Kyle. He nearly kills him with his blasts, while the Third Army invades the Zamaron homeworld, but the injured Kyle transforms into the White Lantern, having mastered the seven powers of the emotional spectrum due to his refusal to give up on Ganthet helping him master the violet power of love. When Ganthet witnesses Kyle being able to destroy the Third Army, he becomes fearful and flees, while the group will apparently be able to stop the Guardians' threat.Green Lantern: New Guardians #16 (January 2013) When the First Lantern Volthoom is freed,Green Lantern Corps Annual #1 (January 2013) he imprisons the Guardians on the planet Maltus and restores their emotions to their original state. Ganthet comes to feel shame for his actions and for his battle with Kyle.Green Lantern (vol. 5) #17 (February 2013) In the final battle after Volthoom is destroyed by Hal Jordan and Nekron, the Guardians are freed but are executed by a Parallax-empowered Sinestro. He spares only Ganthet and reunites him with the still-living Sayd, citing his reasons as being that he knows what it is like to lose everything, but exiles them both from Oa.Green Lantern (vol. 5) #20 (May 2013) Ganthet and Sayd later observe Kyle. Ganthet reflects that he and Kyle have grown a great deal during their time together, but it is time for Kyle to 'leave the nest' and make his own way.Green Lantern: New Guardians #20 (May 2013) =DC Rebirth= Following the Green Lantern Corps disappearance with nobody protecting the universe, Ganthet and Sayd are happy on an unknown planet elsewhere, but the former sensed the spectrum of green light.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps: Rebirth one-shot (July 2016) Their exile has ended when a Green Power ring arrive on the planet Nok, asking them to find Hal Jordan.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #8 (November 2016) Ganthet and Sayd realized Hal's life is in peril so they summoned Kyle Rayner to save his life.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #9 (November 2016) They used their power and Kyle's white ring to open a doorway to Emerald Space in the afterlife and manages to bring Hal back to the realm of the living.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #10 (December 2016) Ganthet encouraged Hal about harnessing the green light of pure willpower and the need of forging a new Green ring. He told Hal that the Green Lantern Corps has returned while they arrived at the base of Mogo and reunited it.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #11 (December 2016) While the Green Lantern Corps are reinstated, Ganthet and Sayd assign Hal and Kyle to find Saint Walker.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #14 (February 2017) After they brought Saint Walker back to the base of the Green Lantern Corps,Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #16 (March 2017) they called Kyle to test his White Lantern power which they believed could bring the resurrection of the Blue Lantern Corps. When Saint Walker attempted a psionic link to Kyle's power, he was prevented from doing so by an unknown presence, which caused Kyle's White Lantern power to shut down, leading to his return as a Green Lantern.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #17 (March 2017) Later, Ganthet and Sayd were attacked and kidnapped by the Controllers.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #33 (November 2017) They wanted to harvest Sayd's power to empower the Controllers, which horrified Ganthet. Four Green Lanterns of the Earth, however, were able to locate the Controllers' base at sector 3001 and attacked.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #35 (December 2017) After the Controllers were defeated, Ganthet announced that Sayd will return as the Guardians of the Universe including the Templar Guardians as new members for that will be their legacy.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #36 (January 2018) Other versions In the Star Trek/Green Lantern crossover series, Ganthet is shown being menaced by an unseen figure that proclaimed it has killed all of the other Guardians and destroyed the six other Corps. This meant that Ganthet was in possession of the last rings of each of the six non- Green Lantern corps rings as the unknown entity attacked him. Using the last of his power, Ganthet transports himself and the rings to the Star Trek universe, where his corpse is later discovered by the USS Enterprise and taken aboard for examination.Star Trek/Green Lantern: The Spectrum War #1 After Hal Jordan makes contact with the Enterprise, it was revealed that the enemy attacking Ganthet was Nekron, who had destroyed virtually all other life in their universe. Ganthet sacrificed himself to initiate the 'Last Light' protocol and send the last rings and ring-wielders to another universe. However, although this action saved Hal, Carol Ferris and Saint Walker, it became apparent that Sinestro, Atrocitus and Larfleeze also escaped and, more importantly, Nekron also survived, finally manifesting at the site of Vulcan's destruction.Star Trek/Green Lantern: The Spectrum War #3 In other media =Television= * Although never called by name, Ganthet and the other Guardians of the Universe appear in Superman: The Animated Series, Justice League and Justice League Unlimited. Ganthet as he appears in Green Lantern: The Animated Series * Ganthet and the rest of the Guardians also appear in Green Lantern: The Animated Series, with Ganthet voiced by Ian Abercrombie. Ganthet is characterized early in the series as being more sympathetic to Hal Jordan's heroic intents, going so far as to suggest outlawed solutions to problems the rest of the Guardians refuse to acknowledge through a prototype Blue Lantern battery. Much in the same way as in the comics, Ganthet advises the Council not to discard emotions completely and emphasizes the need to reinforce their trust in willpower with the emotion of hope. =Film= * Ganthet appears in the animated film Green Lantern: First Flight voiced by Larry Drake.

His former band Los Rodr√≠guez was a major success in Spain and throughout Latin America mainly during the 1990s. He is multi-instrumentalist and became one of the main icons of Argentine rock, selling over 1.3 million records to date. Life and career =Abuelos de la Nada= Andres Calamaro was born in Buenos Aires. At 17 years of age he participated as a guest in the recording of an album of the group Ra√≠ces, and shortly after he started his own band, the Elmer Band, with guitarist friend Gringui Herrera. This band had an underground hit, Tristeza de la Ciudad (City Blues).Official biography (Spanish) When Miguel Abuelo, leader of Los Abuelos de la Nada, returned to Argentina, he reunited the band and invited Calamaro to play keyboards. The band was a big success; Calamaro wrote some of their greatest hits, such as Sin gamul√°n, Mil horas and Costumbres argentinas. =First solo period= Before the dissolution of Los Abuelos de la Nada, Calamaro released his first solo album, Hotel Calamaro in 1984. A second album, Vida Cruel, recorded shortly after his separation from the band, was received warmly by the press but did not achieve commercial success. After a third album, Por Mirarte (1988), Calamaro started producing for bands such as Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, Los Enanitos Verdes and soloists such as Fabiana Cantilo. Calamaro closed the 1980s with his own band, featuring old friends Gringui Herrera and Ariel Rot, who recently came back from Spain. The trio recorded the album Nadie sale vivo de aqu√≠ (No One Gets Out of Here Alive) in 1989 with a number of guest musicians, which obtained the nomination of Best Record of the Year. =Los Rodr√≠guez= Due to the economic situation in Argentina, Calamaro and Rot settled in Spain, where they created the band Los Rodr√≠guez with Juli√°n Infante and Germ√°n Villela on drums. The band didn't have a bass player, but Guillermo Martin, Candi Avello, and later Daniel Zamora accompanied the band in recordings and tours. Los Rodr√≠guez released three successful studio albums: Buena Suerte (1991), Sin documentos (1993) and Palabras m√°s, palabras menos (1995), as well as the live Disco Pirata (1992), and the compilation Hasta luego (1996). Sin documentos gave them international acclaim, with its mixture of Rock, Flamenco and Latin American rhythms. They toured Spain and Latin America, and entered the history of Rock in Spanish. =Solo= Andr√©s Calamaro released Grabaciones Encontradas (\\"Found recordings\\" which in Spanish could also be understood as \\"Conflicting Recordings\\") while working with Los Rodr√≠guez. After Palabras m√°s, palabras menos, the band released a \\"Greatest Hits\\" album, which sold nicely, and then dissolved. In 1996, Calamaro performed \\"Cosas Que Me Ayudan A Olvidar (Things That Help Me To Forget)\\" for the AIDS benefit album Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin produced by the Red Hot Organization. In 1997 Calamaro recorded Alta suciedad (literally \\"High Filth,\\" but also a pun \\"High Society\\"/\\"Alta Sociedad\\"), which sold over half a million copies and took him again touring around Latin America. Calamaro began composing song after song. In six months, he had over 100 songs ready to be released. Thirty seven of these found their way to his next album, Honestidad brutal. The album included hits such as: Te quiero igual, Paloma, Los aviones, Cuando te conoc√≠ and La parte de adelante. This double CD was created after the breakup with his girlfriend, which reflected in the songs. The album also contains a collaboration with Diego Maradona. In 2000, he recorded 103 songs in his five-CD album El Salm√≥n. =Free music= In the following years, Calamaro made many guest appearances in concerts and recordings. He posted unpublished songs from 2001-2002 for free download over the Internet, saying that \\"Music belongs to those who want to hear it; and to nobody else\\".

Filipino audiences, specifically the lower-class population, supported Franzen because of his comedic and emotional nature. He was considered the underdog housemate, especially during his first month inside the house. He is also known for habitually picking his nose at all times and playing strip games with Jason inside the House. Franzen had violated numerous house rules, but despite automatic nominations, popular vote had kept him in the House. His mouthing of words (lip-synching) became the last straw. After much deliberation, Endemol decided on Day 86 (November 15, 2005) that Franzen should be evicted. However, in lieu of this, Cass (who somehow understood Franzen's \\"words\\") made up her mind to voluntarily exit from the house in exchange of his retention. Big Brother valued this and decided to let the public choose whether Franzen should stay or leave. The next day, however, voting was stopped and Franzen's automatic eviction was finalized after Franzen violated the rules again by telling Jason what happened in the confession room.

Buchanan, in which the author argues that western culture is dying and will soon be imperilled. Western cultures have lower-than-replacement birth rates while populations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America are exploding.  Summary  The title of the book is a reference to Oswald Spengler's Decline of the West. Buchanan argues that the culture that produced western civilization as traditionally understood is in its death throes in the United States which will no longer be a western country by the year 2050. He uses United Nations population statistics to analyze the recent trends in global populations, especially major declines in European nations and major increases in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Buchanan argues that the United States has a \\"nation within a nation\\" already. The population of 30 million foreign born (of which 11 million are \\"illegal aliens\\") is larger than the entire population of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. Buchanan argues that \\"counter culture\\" of the 1960s has become the dominant culture, which aims to rewrite American history and dismantle its heritage. He sees this as a hostile culture which regards western civilization with antipathy. He writes: \\"A new generation has now grown up for whom the cultural revolution is not a revolution at all, but the culture they were born into and have known all their lives.\\" He sees the new culture as being intolerant towards those of differing beliefs and determined to impose political correctness. Buchanan argues that the death of the Christian faith is the primary cause of low birth rates, hopelessness, and political utopianism. He cites examples of anti- Christian sentiment such as the negative reactions to Catholic films and the triumphant attitude of secularism. He writes: \\"Western Man has decided he can disobey God without consequence and become his own God.\\" And at the same time: \\"The new hedonism seems unable to give people a reason to go on living.\\" He depicts the United States as a country divided between the old culture and the new with little contact between two diametrically opposed systems of thought. Reception John Attarian praised the book. > To avert catastrophe, Buchanan rightly calls for repudiating the left's > ideology of national suicide. But he offers valuable specifics too. It may > be too late for Europe to exit the highway, but America still can. > Depopulation being the worse problem, we must encourage American women to > have children, with pro-family tax relief such as raising the federal tax > credit for each child, giving employers tax incentives to pay parents higher > wages, and so on... Buchanan concedes that it may be too late to save the > West, but closes by affirming that America is a beautiful country. \\"And that > is why we must never stop trying to take her back.\\" That call to undaunted > perseverance is the right parting note. Kirkus Reviews panned the book. The review called it \\"[s]hameless, embarrassing rantings\\" and also remarked that \\"[l]ittle attests to the moral health of this nation more than the fact that it‚Äôs made a mockery of Buchanan's presidential ambitions time and again.\\" The review particularly criticized Buchanan's claim that \\"[h]ad it not been for the West, African rulers would still be trafficking in the flesh of their kinsmen\\" as an example of dishonest historical revisionism. Jonah Goldberg of The National Review: > First, let me say I both admire and dislike Buchanan's writing for the same > reason: He brilliantly manages to do with one language what Yassir Arafat > does with two. He offers red meat to the extremists while at the same giving > himself the wiggle room to deny he said anything controversial in the first > place. This is no mean feat.

She was one of seven children of James Mangnall of Hollinhurst, Lancashire, and London, and Richmal, daughter of John Kay of Manchester to survive infancy.

The freighter was delivered to the Navy at Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on 21 September 1918 and was placed in commission the following day for service in the Naval Overseas Transportation Service with Lieutenant Commander Francis A. Brannen, USNRF, in command. Aries was named for the constellation. After fitting out, the freighter sailed for France late in October and arrived at St. Nazaire on 11 November, the day Germany signed the armistice ending the fighting of World War I. Lake Geneva was then assigned to European waters. Based at Cardiff, Wales, she carried coal from that port and from Belfast, Ireland, to French ports. After continuing this duty through the spring of 1919, she sailed for Charleston, South Carolina, carrying some 1,500 tons of Army ordnance material. However, while en route to that port, she was diverted to Newport News, Virginia, where she arrived on 12 July.  Between the wars  After discharging her cargo, Lake Geneva was slated for demobilization. She was decommissioned on 17 July 1919 and then returned to the USSB, in whose hands she remained until the mid-1920s. She was then sold to the Bison Steam Ship Company, of Tonawanda, New York, and renamed John J. O'Hagan in honor of the manager of the firm which had purchased her. She operated out of Buffalo, New York carrying coal and iron ore on the Great Lakes.  World War II service  Shortly before the United States entered World War II, the Federal Government repurchased the ship. She was transferred from the Maritime Commission to the US Navy on 22 September 1941. Renamed Manomet on 15 October 1941 and designated AG-37, the freighter was prepared for naval service at East Boston, Massachusetts, by the General Ship and Engine Works. During this work, Manomet was renamed Aries on 7 January 1942 and simultaneously re-designated AK-51. She was delivered on 23 May 1942 to the Marine Lines of New York City, which operated her on a contract basis for the Naval Transportation Service until early July. Returned to Navy custody on 11 July 1942, Aries was placed in commission on 18 July 1942 at the Bethlehem Steel Company in Brooklyn, New York and Lieutenant Philip S. Deane, Jr., USNR, assumed temporary command for Lieutenant Commander L. Sederholt, USNR, who reported a week later. After taking on cargo, ammunition, and supplies, the cargo ship stood out to sea and joined a convoy bound for Iceland. She stopped at Halifax, Nova Scotia, for three days before resuming her voyage to Iceland. On 18 August, she reached Reykjav√≠k and discharged equipment and supplies ashore. For the next 12 months, Aries operated in Icelandic waters under the orders of Commanding Officer, Naval Operating Base, Iceland, transporting US Army cargo between the Icelandic ports of Reykjav√≠k, Akranes, Keflav√≠k, Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur, Budareyri, Sey√∞isfj√∂r√∞ur, and Akureyri. The ship left Iceland on 21 August 1943, on a course for the United States, and reached Boston, Massachusetts on 3 September. She then entered a shipyard for alterations and repairs. On 5 December, the vessel joined a southbound convoy and sailed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She left Cuba on 5 January 1944, proceeded to the Panama Canal Zone, and moored at Balboa for repairs to her main engine before setting a course for San Diego, California. Upon reaching San Diego on 12 February, the vessel underwent more repairs to her main engine. Late in April, she entered the Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California, for replacement of the main engine. After a series of sea trials, the ship got underway on 6 September, bound for Pearl Harbor and arrived there on the 18th. She was drydocked briefly for the installation of a new propeller before sailing for the South Pacific on 6 October. Aries reached Manus in the Admiralty Islands, on 28 October and commenced provisioning warships of the 3rd Fleet. After emptying her holds, the vessel took on more cargo and weighed anchor on 10 December. She made Ulithi five days later and began unloading operations. The ship had completed this task by 7 January 1945 and, a week later, sailed for Guam. She unloaded cargo there and was back at Ulithi on 25 January. The vessel remained at the atoll conducting intraharbor cargo operations until 25 April. She then began preparations for the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines. On 20 May, the ship set a course for San Pedro Bay. She arrived there on the 24th and commenced discharging her cargo. In mid-June, the vessel began taking on various equipment and supplies for transit to Ulithi. She got underway on 2 July, arrived back at Ulithi on the 8th, and was assigned duty as a station ship, her role through the end of hostilities on 15 August.  After VJ Day Aries left Ulithi on the 22nd and proceeded to Apra Harbor, Guam. There, she took on goods for shipment to Leyte. The vessel reached Philippine waters on 5 September and remained off Leyte engaged in cargo operations through early October. The vessel departed the area on the 7th and dropped anchor at Eniwetok 10 days later. After filling her cargo holds, she set a course for Japan, arrived in Tokyo Bay on 6 November, and began discharging her supplies in support of occupation forces ashore. On 30 November, the cargo ship left Japanese waters and set a course for the United States. She paused en route at Midway on 11 December and finally reached San Francisco on the 24th. The ship then discharged all her cargo and ammunition in preparation for deactivation.  Final disposition  She later moved to Oakland, California, where she was decommissioned on 28 March 1946. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 17 April 1946. The vessel was transferred to the Maritime Commission on 1 July 1946. She was sold on 5 May 1947 to Captain A. S. Oko for operation as a bulk carrier. She was scrapped in 1952.

Biography  Dariush Forouhar's wife, she became a member of the Party of the Iranian Nation when she was a university student, launching an anti-Shah campaign alongside Dariush Forouhar. After a while, they got married. Their witness in absentia was Dr. Mohammad Mossadegh and the clergyman marrying the couple was Ayatollah Zanjani. Both of the Forouhars were proponents of a democratic and independent Iran and supported the separation of state and religion, they felt that the Islamic Republic led to a concentration of power and made political reform difficult. Parvaneh Majd Eskandari was stabbed 25 times on the second floor of her home while she was very ill. She was 60 years old at the time of her death. They are survived by a daughter, Parastou Forouhar and a son, Arash Forouhar. Before her death, she had told human rights watchdogs based in New York: \\"We are living with the fear of being killed. Every night when we go to bed we thank God the Almighty for His blessing of living for another day.\\" Concerning her mother, Parastou believes: \\"At the time of her death my mother was wearing an overall over her sleeping gown which indicates that she was not waiting for anyone and because she was killed in front of the wardrobe where family documents were usually kept, she had most probably gone upstairs to fetch the deeds of the house to use it for release of my father on bail.\\" The death of Parvaneh Eskandari Forouhar and Dariush Forouhar was followed by the assassinations of Mohammad Mokhtari and Mohammad-Ja'far Pouyandeh, two well known Iranian writers a few days later. The Iranian Ministry of Intelligence later denied responsibility for these assassinations and claimed the Ministry employees had acted on his own accord.

It was originally in the historic county of Cumberland. Within the parish is St Bees Head which is the only Heritage Coast between Wales and Scotland which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is an RSPB reserve and has the largest seabird colony in north-west England. St Bees Lighthouse stands on the North Head which is the most westerly point of Northern England. St Bees is a popular holiday destination due to the coastline and proximity to the Western Lake District. In the village there is the Norman St Bees Priory, and St Bees School founded in 1583. The Wainwright Coast to Coast Walk starts from the north end of St Bees Bay. The village is served by the Cumbrian Coast Railway.

The name St Bees is a corruption of the Norse name for the village, which is given in the earliest charter of the Priory as \\"Kyrkeby becok\\", which can be translated as the \\"Church town of Bega\\",Liber 1, para i, The Register of the Priory of St Bees, Rev J Wilson, 1915, Published by the Surtees Society. relating to the local Saint Bega.\\"St Bega ‚Äì Cult, Fact and Legend\\", John M Todd, Transactions of Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society 1980 ‚Äì Volume LXXX.

Carved stones at the priory show that Irish-Norse Vikings settled here in the 10th century. St Bees Priory: The Norman west door St Bees Priory St Bees School The Normans did not reach Cumberland until 1092, and when they took over the local lordships, William Meschin, Lord of Egremont, used the existing religious site\\"The pre-Conquest Church in St Bees, Cumbria: a possible minster?\\", John M Todd, Transactions of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and archaeological Society, 2003 to found a Benedictine priory for a prior and six monks sometime between 1120 and 1135. The priory was subordinate to the great Benedictine monastery of St Mary at York. The magnificent Norman doorway of the priory dates from just after this time; probably about 1150. The priory had a great influence on the area. The monks worked the land, fished, and extended the priory buildings. The ecclesiastical parish of St Bees was large and stretched to Ennerdale, Loweswater, Wasdale and Eskdale. The coffin routes from these outlying areas to the mother church in St Bees can still be followed in places. The priory was closed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries on the orders of Henry VIII in 1539. The nave and transepts of the monastic church have continued in use as the parish church to the present day, but much of the extensive monastic buildings were plundered or fell into decay. Remarkably, the small village of St Bees produced two of the archbishops of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I: Edmund Grindal; Archbishop of Canterbury and Edwin Sandys; Archbishop of York.\\"Archbishop Grindal 1519‚Äì1583 The struggle for a reformed church\\" ‚Äì Patrick Collinson 1979 In about 1519 Edmund Grindal was born in Cross Hill House, St Bees, which still exists, and is marked with a plaque.Archbishop Grindal's birthplace; Cross Hill, St Bees, Cumbria. By John M Todd and Mary Todd. Transactions of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society, Vol XCIX, 1999. He was probably educated at the priory across the valley. A devout Protestant, he made his mark in the reign of Edward VI, but had to flee to Strasbourg when the Catholic Mary I ascended the throne. On Mary's death the country once again became Protestant, and Grindal became Bishop of London, Archbishop of York and then Archbishop of Canterbury. His undoing was opposing Queen Elizabeth I on liberal religious meetings and he was suspended. He died in 1583 still in disgrace, but, virtually on his death bed, he founded St Bees School which existed until July 2015, when it temporarily closed; The School re-opened on 6 September 2018. The present primary school in the village was established in the 1870s. Modern growth The site of the priory is on an area of firm ground higher than the peat beds that fill the valley, and it is logical that the original settlement would grow up there. However the area was constricted, and as the village expanded it grew on up the opposite side of the valley. The oldest existing house dates from the early 16th century and the present Main Street was created from a string of farms and farmworkers' dwellings. The 19th century saw the start of great changes. In 1816 St Bees Theological College was founded, and was the first theological college for the training of Church of England clergy outside Oxford and Cambridge. To house the college, the monastic chancel of the Priory was re-roofed and served as the main lecture room, and additional lecture rooms were built in the 1860s. At one time the college had 100 students, and over 2,600 clergy were trained before it closed in 1895.\\"St Bees College ‚Äì Pioneering Higher Education in 19th Century Cumbria\\" Rev Dr Trevor Park, 2008, St. Bees School started its era of expansion with the building of the quadrangle in 1846 using compensation from the rich mine-owning Lowther family, who had illegally obtained the lucrative mineral rights for Whitehaven from the school in 1742 at a derisory sum.\\"The Headmaster, The Provost, and the Earl; The affair of the St Bees School mineral lease, 1812‚Äì1817, John M Todd. Transactions of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society, Vol LXXXIII, 1983 This was the first step in St. Bees School's rise from a local institution to becoming one of the new \\"public schools\\" on the fashionable model of Dr Arnold's Rugby School. By 1916 numbers had reached 350, many new buildings had been erected, and the school had become known nationally. Perhaps some of the greatest changes were after 1849 when the Furness Railway reached the village. St Bees attracted the professional classes which commuted to Whitehaven or Workington. This led to the building of many of the larger houses and Lonsdale Terrace. The railway brought tourists, and as early as 1851 the Lord Mayor of London stayed at the Seacote Hotel. This long history of attracting tourists for \\"bucket and spade\\" holidays has continued to this day. The railway made possible the export of St Bees sandstone. Huge amounts of stone were quarried, much of it for building the boom town of Barrow-in-Furness. This industry died out in the 1970s, but has since been revived, and there are now two working quarries in the parish. Agriculture was originally the mainstay of the village economy. Gradually, during the 19th century, service employment for the school and lodgings for the college gave additional income, and with the advent of commuters, the village's social mix was becoming more middle class. Tourism and quarries also provided employment, and many village men found work in the iron ore mines at Cleator. Thus the 19th century saw the change from a rural backwater based on agriculture, to the more diversified role of a dormitory village for professional and industrial worker alike, and its growth into a minor academic centre. The start of the 20th century saw yet another decline in agriculture, and this has continued to today, when there are only a few farms left. Industrial decline also hit West Cumbria as a whole, particularly after the boom years of both world wars. However, following the Second World War, two major industries were established which have had a profound effect on the community.\\"100 Years of St Bees\\", Douglas Sim. 1995, The former Marchon Chemical Company at Whitehaven, and UKAEA/BNFL at Sellafield both soaked up village labour released by the declining heavy iron and mining industries, and brought a large influx of the technical and scientific university-educated middle class into the village; rather like the first arrival of the professional classes a century earlier. There is now an extensive science park ‚Äì Westlakes, on the northern fringe of the parish, at which the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority has its national headquarters. The last two decades have seen a significant revival in tourism, boosted by the Coast to Coast walk and increasing recognition of the unique landscape of the St Bees Heritage Coast. In 2014, it was rated one of the most attractive postcode areas to live in England. St Bees Man In 1981 an archaeological excavation at the priory revealed a vault with a lead coffin containing an astonishingly well preserved body ‚Äì now known as the St Bees Man.

Effigies of Maud and Anthony can be seen in an extensive history display which includes the shroud in which he was wrapped. Governance St Bees is within the Copeland UK Parliamentary constituency. Trudy Harrison is the Member of parliament. Before Brexit, it was in the North West England European Parliamentary Constituency. Transport links Two passengers trains crossing at St Bees station The village is served by St Bees railway station on the Cumbrian Coast Line, with trains from Barrow-in-Furness, Lancaster, Preston and Carlisle. as from May 20, 2018 there are 30 stopping passenger trains Mon- Friday, and there are 16 trains a day on Sundays, this latter after a break in service of nearly 50 years. The village is on the B5345 from Whitehaven to Iron Bridge junction near Beckermet. Sport and recreation The village has a football team which competes in the Cumbria County league. There are facilities for rugby, football and cricket at the Adams recreation ground adjacent to the Seacote beach. This playing field was created in memory of Baron Adams of Ennerdale. The sports facilities of St Bees School are also available, which include a sports hall, squash, tennis and fives courts, and an indoor swimming pool. St Bees beach from the South Head Coast-based recreational activities at St Bees are: windsurfing, kite-surfing, rock climbing, bouldering, swimming, jet-skiing, water-skiing, canoeing and para- gliding. These are undertaken on St Bees Head and off the large sandy surf beach. The circular walk to St Bees Head and Birkhams quarry featured in the May 2012 booklet of the best coastal walks in UK published by the Daily Telegraph newspaper; it being one of only two walks covered in the north west of England. Wainwright Coast to Coast walk Start of coast-to-coast walk at the beach St Bees is the start of the Wainwright Coast to Coast walk, which was devised by Alfred Wainwright in 1973. It is an unofficial and mostly unsignposted long-distance footpath in Northern England. Devised by Alfred Wainwright, it passes through three contrasting National Parks: the Lake District National Park, the Yorkshire Dales National Park, and the North York Moors National Park. Wainwright recommended that walkers dip their booted feet in the Irish Sea at St Bees and, at the end of the walk, in the North Sea at Robin Hood's Bay. At St Bees the start is marked by the \\"Wainwright Wall\\" which explains the walk and its history. A new interpretation board and the steel banner were installed in summer 2013 by St Bees Parish Council and the Wainwright Society.

Mysterious poet In August 1909, the famous Russian artistic periodical Apollon received a letter with verses on a perfumed paper with black mourning edges, signed only by a single Russian letter Ch. The verses were filled with half-revelations about its author--supposedly a beautiful maiden with dark secrets. The same day a woman with a beautiful voice phoned the journal's publisher Sergei Makovsky and arranged for publication of the verses. Over the next few months, publications of the newfound poetic star were the major hit of the magazine, and many believed that they had found a major new talent in Russian poetry. The identity of the author was slowly revealed: her name was Baroness Cherubina de Gabriak, a Russian-speaking girl of French and Polish ancestry who lived in a very strict Roman Catholic aristocratic family, who severely limited the girl's contacts with the outside world because of an unspoken secret in her past. Almost all of Apollon‚Äôs male writers fell in love with her, most of all the great poet Nikolai Gumilyov. He wrote a series of passionate love letters to her and received quite passionate answers. The mystery of the newfound genius was short-lived. In November it was discovered that the verses were written by a disabled schoolteacher, Elisaveta Ivanovna Dmitrieva, with the participation of a major Apollon contributor and editor, the poet Maximilian Voloshin. Apparently Sergei Makovsky had rejected several of Dmitrieva's verses; and Voloshin, who knew his publisher quite well, invented the legend about Cherubina. There is still controversy about the correct attribution of Gabriak's corpus. Most contemporaries, including all of Apollon‚Äôs critics, were certain that all the verses and most of the letters were written by Voloshin himself; after all, they claimed, Cherubina was a first-rank poet and Dmitrieva was not. Both Elisaveta Dmitrieva and Maximilian Voloshin claimed that the verses were all Dmitrieva's, and that Voloshin only selected them and suggested themes and expressions. Modern researchers tend to support attribution of the verses to Dmitrieva, as they are quite similar to her later works. Duel Nikolai Gumilyov was outraged by the thought that his passionate romantic correspondence might in fact have been with a mocking Maximilian Voloshin. Even so, Dmitrieva claimed that she had written the letters to Gumilyov herself, had indeed been in love, but had known the romance would end the moment Gumilyov saw her. Gumilyov talked in public about his romantic affair with Dmitrieva and he did it in rather rude expressions, and on November 19, 1909, at the studio of artist Ivan Bilibin, Voloshin slapped Gumilyov across the face,–ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º–∏–ª–∏–∞–Ω –í–æ–ª–æ—à–∏–Ω, –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –ß–µ—Ä—É–±–∏–Ω—ã.

Story of Cherubina (written down by T.Shanko), retrieved 6 December 2008 which by the customs of the time made a duel inevitable. The duel took place on November 22 on the banks of the Chernaya River, which had been the site of the fatal duel between Alexander Pushkin and Georges d'Anth√®s. Voloshin's seconds were Aleksei Nikolaevich Tolstoi and Count Shervashidze; Gumilyov's seconds were Mikhail Kuzmin and Eugene Znosko-Borovsky. Gumilyov shot first, but missed. Voloshin's pistol misfired. He proposed to end the duel, but Gumilyov insisted that Voloshin has to shoot. Voloshin shot in the air, being afraid to kill Gumilyov. Later, Voloshin confessed that he simply didn't know how to shoot. The seconds offered that they shake hands, but both refused. All contacts between them were broken off until a few months before Gumilyov's death in 1921, when he visited Voloshin and restored their friendship. Elisaveta Dmitrieva The real author of Gabriak's poetry, Elisaveta Dmitrieva, was born on March 31, 1887. Between 1890 and 1903 she suffered from tuberculosis of the bones and was left lame and barely able to walk. She studied old French and spanish literature at Saint Petersburg State University, and published some verses both before and after her Gabriak period but without much success. In 1911 she married Vsevolod Nikolaievitch Wassilieff, an engineer and uncle of french admiral Alexandre Wassilieff and took his last name. In the early 1920s, she worked with poet and translator Samuil Marshak on theatrical plays for children. Later she also published prose and translations. Starting from 1921, she was searched and interrogated by the State Political Directorate along with other members of the Anthroposophic Society. Finally in 1927 she was exiled to Tashkent where she died in 1928 of liver cancer. Shortly before her death, she was visited in Tashkent by her friend a prominent Sinologist Julian Shchutsky and wrote, influenced by him, 21 poems attributed to Li Xiang Zi, a fictional Chinese poet exiled for his \\"belief in immortality of human spirit\\". The name of Li Xiang, invented by Shchutsky, means \\"a house under a pear tree\\", where Dmitrieva indeed lived in Tashkent. Origin of the name The name, Cherubina, was taken from the story A Secret Of Telegraph Hill by Bret Harte. The last name, Gabriak, was derived from Gabriakh, the name of a toy, a wooden imp, presented by Voloshin to Elisaveta Dmitrieva. Voloshin found the name Gabriakh in the book Demonomanie des Sorciers by Jean Bodin, where it belonged to an imp, protecting people from evil spirits.

ViacomCBS Networks Italia  In February 2011, Viacom set up Viacom International Media Networks Italia to purchase a 30% stake of the Rainbow S.r.l. animation studio for 62 million euros (US$83 million). The purchase was called \\"the most significant transaction [in Italian entertainment]\\" of the year by the Fondazione Ente dello Spettacolo. Viacom originally sought to buy out the entire studio,http://www.businesspeople.it/Business/Finanza/La-Paramount-mette-sotto- contratto-le-Winx_15558 but eventually decided to keep its founder Iginio Straffi at the helm and left him 70% of the studio. As a result of the purchase, Viacom's Nickelodeon networks broadcast Rainbow's shows worldwide. Viacom Italia has also coordinated co-productions between Nickelodeon's American studios and Rainbow, including Winx Club since 2010 and Club 57 in 2019.  MTV in EMEAA  On 1 August 1987, Viacom formed a joint venture with BT and Robert Maxwell, and created the first MTV channel in Europe. The channel was based in Amsterdam upon launch before relocating to London. From 1997, MTV Networks Europe established its regionalisation strategy launching localised channels across many European countries/regions. This is a list of regional MTV channels still operating in Europe, West Asia, Africa, in order of launch: * MTV Europe (August 1987) * MTV Asia (May 1995) * MTV China / MTV Taiwan (April 1995) * MTV Australia & New Zealand (1996; previously MTV Australia) * MTV Germany (March 1997) * MTV UK (July 1997) * MTV Italy (September 1997) * MTV Russia (September 1998, relaunched October 2013) * MTV France (June 2000) * MTV Poland (July 2000) * MTV Netherlands (September 2000) * MTV Spain (September 2000) * MTV Japan (January 2001) * MTV South Korea (July 2001) * MTV Romania (June 2002; closed February 2019) * MTV Portugal (July 2003) * MTV Flanders (February 2004) * MTV Ireland (February 2004) * MTV Africa (February 2005) * MTV Denmark (May 2005) * MTV Finland, MTV Sweden, MTV Norway (September 2005) * MTV New Zealand (August 2006; closed November 2010 replaced with MTV Australia & New Zealand) * MTV Ukraine (August 2007; closed May 2013) * MTV Hungary (October 2007; closed in December 2013; relaunched in October 2017) * MTV Israel (October 2007) * MTV Middle-East (October 2007; closed 2015) * MTV Live HD (September 2008) * MTV Switzerland (April 2009) * MTV South Africa (2015)  MTV branding  Upon its launch in Europe in the late 1980s, MTV Europe made use of MTV US's on-air identity. Overtime, MTV Europe gradually produced its own on-air identity throughout the 1990s. From 1997, MTV's regionalization throughout Europe brought about specialized on-air identity which reflected the tastes and influences from each region. As part of a global rebranding strategy, MTV Networks International decided to produce a new on-air identity that would air on all MTV channels around the world (except MTV US, MTV Canada and MTV Brazil). On 1 July 2009 all 64 MTV channels globally began to share the same on-air branding. This branding made use of a standardised logo, idents and promos (except MTV US, MTV Canada and MTV Brazil). The on-air branding initiative was called Pop X1000 reflecting the changing nature of popular culture with MTV at the heart of these rapid changes. The branding was designed by MTV's design department World Design Studio in Milan (home to both Fininvest and Mediaset), with additional designs added by other global departments throughout the year. The branding was overseen by Universal Everything. This branding was adopted by MTV Networks Europe, MTV Networks Asia, MTV Networks Africa and MTV Networks Latin America. As part of MTV's rebrand awareness campaign MTV teamed up with Spanish retailer ZARA in December 2009 to provide branded themed T-shirts and hoodies representing the \\"Pop X 1000%\\" campaign. On 8 November 2010 MTV launched its third phase of idents. In 2010, MTV US rebranded its entire network of channels producing a revised version of the traditional MTV logo. It was decided that MTV Networks International channels would adopt this logo at a later date. On 1 July 2011 MTV Networks Europe will rebrand its network across Europe and globally. MTV's will replace its traditional logo the MTV:Music Television logo to be replaced by the current MTV US logo. On 30 June 2011 MTV's localized websites throughout Europe began to use the new branding. As part of a new strategy MTV Networks Europe will be part of Viacom Media International Networks. It is expected that MTV Networks Europe will be rebranded in the winter of 2011. In the fall of 2013, Viacom International Media Networks announced it would relaunch its MTV channels globally with a new on-air identity. This came into effect on 1 October 2013. On 25 June 2015, MTV International channels were rebranded with a new initiative to get more viewers involved with the channel. MTV launched MTVBump.com where viewers could upload short video clips which will air on MTV channels worldwide (excluding MTV US and MTV Canada). MTV also launched MTV Art Breaks where creative viewers can create special MTV idents. MTV would also launch MTV Creative, another initiative to coincide with MTV Bump. However, MTV's rebrand still saw falling ratings. In early 2018, MTV Global began to roll out 'MTV Mood' identity on-air and online. The new look was first used by local MTV channels across Latin America. MTV Europe began using the new look at the end of 2017 along with MTV Germany, before rolling out across Europe in January/February 2018.  Websites  Since January 2010, MTV Networks Europe has started to rebrand its localized websites featuring a standard website for each region. The website design is similar for each region but has information, news and entertainment specific to each region. MTV Belgium, MTV Netherlands, MTV Switzerland, MTV Portugal, MTV Sweden and MTV Denmark were the first to receive the new look website layout and design. A new design and layout were released in late 2017 before rolling out across MTV globally in 2018. A new global design was launched in October 2019.  Broadcasting Agreements  ViacomCBS International Media Networks has utilized the broadcasting laws and regulation from both the United Kingdom and Poland to license and secure broadcasting agreements across Europe, whilst maintaining EU regulation. In the past, the majority of MTV's channels were regulated by authorities based in the UK (Ofcom) and Poland (The National Broadcasting Council). However, due to the UK's impending exit from the European Union the company has relocated many of its broadcasting licenses from the UK to regulators based in the Czech Republic (RRTV) and the Netherlands.https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2018/04/26/broadcasters-start- moving-licences-away-from-the-uk/ Following Brexit, all channels operating in the UK will remain under OFCOM, whilst all other channels operated by ViacomCBS International Media Networks for the rest of Europe will be regulated from Poland, Czech Republic and/or the Netherlands. Channels for Ireland, Hungary, Czech Republic and pan-European channels are regulated by RRTV in the Czech Republic.http://mtvnetworks.cz Channels for the Benelux region, the Nordic region, France, Poland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Portugal are regulated by authorities in the Netherlands and the remaining channels will be regulated by authorities in the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and/or under a local arrangement with a relevant regulator.

From 4 April 2011 TMF was gradually replaced by Kindernet and where the channel was only available online from the former TMF.nl website. On 1 September 2011 TMF in the Netherlands ceased broadcasting. TMF Nederland was the original channel before launching local channels in Belgium, UK and Australia. These local channels have been replaced with different channels. TMF's digital channels in the Netherlands TMF Live and TMF NL also ceased broadcasting. TMF Flanders in Belgium currently broadcasts as the only TMF channel. * 2011: On 16 September 2011 it was confirmed by Viacom International Media Networks its operations in the Nordic countries, Benelux region and Germany would operate under Viacom International Media Networks Northern Europe. VIMN Northern Europe operates from its central offices in Amsterdam, Stockholm and Berlin. Resulting in job losses at its offices from MTV Networks Benelux in Belgium and the Netherlands. The re- alignment will see all music programming come from its operations in Stockholm. Its Swedish offices operate local channels such as MTV and VH1 within VIMN Northern European's portfolio of music channels. All kids and family programming operates from Berlin these include localized versions of Nickelodeon, Nick Jr. and Kindernet. Whilst all the localized Comedy Central channels will be operated from Amsterdam. VIMN North European's portfolio includes the following territories: Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark. MTV's Amsterdam offices will remain open and will act as the technical play-out hub for the channels. * 2012: In December 2012, both Viacom International Media Networks and ProfMedia announced the closure of MTV Russia. Prof Media who purchased MTV Russia from VIMN in 2007, claimed the MTV brand is no-longer relevant in the territory and will be replaced by a more youth orientated general entertainment brand called 'Friday' on 1 June 2013. MTV Russia is one of the most widely distributed channels in the Russian Federation and was previously rated the most watched channel in the territory. Today, the channel has been relegated to the Top 20 channels in Russia. VIMN stated its commitment to the region stating its other MTV channels and brands such as VH1, Nickelodeon and the newly localized Comedy Central will continue to broadcast across Russia on cable and digital television providers. It has also been stated in some reports that MTV as a brand is in crisis in other Eastern European territories with falling ratings for MTV Poland and other local MTV channels in Central Eastern Europe. This is an ongoing trend for MTV globally. It was reported in the fall of 2012 that MTV US and its other channels had seen a fall in revenue and audience figures. There is competition from on-demand music websites, and MTV's transformation from music oriented television to youth oriented reality and scripted reality shows has failed to ignite the brand. On 31 May 2013 MTV Ukraine ceased broadcasting due to falling ratings. * 2013 On 3 July 2013 Viacom International Media Networks launched a localized version of MTV Base in South Africa. MTV South-Africa is an opt-out feed of the same channel with selected unique programming targeting South Africa. On 5 July 2013 VIMN announced it has purchased 51% of MTV Italy the channel was previously a joint-venture largely owned by Telecom Italia Media and VIMN. The ownership conditions have changed which means VIMN holds a larger share of the channel. On 12 September 2013 VIMN Europe announced it has gained 100% ownership of MTV Italia and associated channels from Telecom Italia. Following the merger of MTV Networks New Zealand and MTV Networks Australia operations into one network based in Sydney in 2010, MTV (Australia & New Zealand) and its sister brand Comedy Central (New Zealand only) were placed under VIMN's ‚Äì Viacom International Media Networks UK, Ireland, Australia, Central Eastern Europe and International Content Distribution. On 11 October 2013, VIMN's Sydney operations announced it would downsize. From year end all broadcasting is to be relocated to VIMN in London. VIMN's Sydney advertising department and Nickelodeon Australia and New Zealand will not be affected by this move. * 2014 From January 2014, MTV Czech Republic & Slovakia will came under full ownership of VIMN Europe. Following a decision by the current operator CME to hand back the licence to VIMN. The channel was replaced by MTV Europe January 2014, with the possibility of the channel relaunching. Similarly, MTV Hungary ceased broadcasting on 31 December 2013. In early 2014, Czech TV regular (RRTV is the licence holder for MTV channels in Eastern Europe) issued MTV Hungary a new licence but this was handed back on 8 January 2014. On 1 August 2015 in Italy MTV Italia (DTT-free to air station) was sold to Sky Italia. In 2013 Viacom took full control of the channel after Telecom Italia Media sold its 51% share. At the same time Viacom launched on the platform of Sky, the new channel MTV Next. Viacom continues to broadcast in Italy through DTT the free- channel MTV Music (Italia) and remains active with Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. through the platform of Sky Italia. MTV Classic Italia and MTV Hits Italia have been closed down on 1 August. On 17 November 2015 the French versions of MTV Base, MTV Pulse and MTV Idol are closed and a French versions of MTV Hits and BET are launched. The European version of MTV Hits ceased broadcasting in France, Belgium and Switzerland and MTV Rocks ceased broadcasting in Switzerland and CanalSat. On Numericable, VH1 and VH1 Classic returns and MTV Dance is launched. * 2016 On 10 January 2016 VIMN shutdown its Greek MTV channel due to a turndown in advertising and competition from MAD TV, the channel was replaced by MTV Europe. VIMN Europe confirmed its closure on 6 January 2016. This does not affect the Greek Nickelodeon service. * 2017‚Äì2020: In the fall of 2017, VIMN closed plans to close VIVA channels in Hungary, Poland, Ireland and the UK. VIMN Germany, Austria and Switzerland confirmed it would reduce the broadcasting hours of the German-speaking VIVA replacing it with an extended version of Comedy Central Germany. By the spring of 2018, VIMN Germany confirmed it would close VIVA in Germany, Austria and Switzerland in January 2019, replacing it with a 24-hour Comedy Central Germany. meanwhile in the UK Nickelodeon, Nick Jr Too and Nicktoons will go 24/7 in 1 January 2019 the same day as the closure of VIVA.

The story introduced a new Green Lantern, Kyle Rayner, who gained a significant fan following. \\"Emerald Twilight\\" was collected as a trade paperback collection in 1994 reprinting the entire three-issue story arc in one volume as Green Lantern: Emerald Twilight (), with cover art by Tony Harris. It was later collected again in 2003 as the Green Lantern: Emerald Twilight/New Dawn TPB (), reprinting Green Lantern (vol. 3) #48-50 and also #51-55, the early stories of Rayner becoming the new Green Lantern with new cover art by Alan Davis and Mark Farmer. A second collection was released in the 2017 trade Kyle Rayner, Green Lantern Volume 1 including Green Lantern #0 and 56-57, R.E.B.E.L.S. '94 #1 and The New Titans #116-117. Synopsis In Green Lantern #46, as part of the \\"Reign of the Supermen!\\" storyline, the extraterrestrial villain Mongul teams up with a Cyborg Superman that had been passing himself off as the real Superman. They use a series of bombs to destroy Hal Jordan's home city of Coast City with the intention of using the area as one of four way-stations for a giant engine that would ultimately transform Earth into the massive spaceship Warworld. Hal Jordan returns to the city to find a massive fortress-engine standing in the ruins of his home and furiously attacks, hearing the voices of those killed crying out in his mind. The voices fall silent when Jordan defeats Mongul in battle. Hal also witnesses the return of Superman, who has defeated the Cyborg elsewhere in the city. In issue #47, he teamed up with Green Arrow for a completely different mission, and at the end of the issue, his thoughts once again turn to Coast City. Issue #48 began with Hal in the center of what used to be Coast City, clutching the remains of a doll - the only physical evidence of the seven million people who once lived there. In a moment of pure anguish, Hal uses his power ring to re-create Coast City, down to the people who had previously died, including his father. When his ring‚Äôs energy runs out, one of the Guardians of the Universe contacts him via a holographic projection to tell him he is in violation of one of the principal rules of the Green Lantern Corps, which forbids Lanterns from using their rings for personal gain. Enraged at their apathy, Hal siphons off the energy from the projection and makes his way to the Guardians‚Äô planet Oa, with the intent of bleeding off all the energy from the Main Power Battery in order to permanently re-create Coast City. Issue #49 saw him going up against various members of the Green Lantern Corps, each of whom fell against Hal, until he got to Oa. Hal steals the rings from each defeated colleague and leaves them for dead. Issue #50 sees Hal battle the renegade former Green Lantern Sinestro on Oa, who had been previously imprisoned in the Main Battery, but released by the Guardians to stop Jordan. Jordan then proceeds to kill Sinestro, as well as his fellow Green Lantern Kilowog. The Guardians, having realized that their cause was lost, had given all their remaining energy to the Guardian named Ganthet, who became the sole Guardian after this energy transference resulted in the death of the rest of them. Hal takes all the energy in the Central Power Battery, and when he emerged from it, he has a new costume and takes the name Parallax. Aftermath Ganthet travels to Earth and finds an illustrator named Kyle Rayner (who had been briefly introduced at the end of issue #48 when he saw Hal fly off and mistook his green flight streak for a shooting star). Ganthet gives Kyle the last remaining power ring, thus making Kyle the last Green Lantern. As Parallax, Hal Jordan became a recurring villain in the DC Universe. In \\"Emerald Fallout\\", which takes place in issues 18-21 of Guy Gardner: Warrior Guy Gardner receives a vision of the events of \\"Emerald Twilight\\". Guy, along with Wonder Woman, Alan Scott, Arisia, Darkstar Ferrin Colos, the Martian Manhunter, Captain Atom and the Ray go to what was left of Oa. He challenges Hal and is defeated when Hal melts his yellow power ring. The character played a central role during the Zero Hour storyline. Later Hal displays his final act of heroism, sacrificing his life to reignite the Sun at the conclusion of The Final Night storyline. Redeemed in the eyes of many of his fellow heroes, he received a hero's funeral. Not fit either for Heaven or Hell, Jordan‚Äôs soul was destined for Purgatory, until he became the newest host for the spirit of God‚Äôs vengeance known as the Spectre, at the end of the Day of Judgment limited series. During the events of Green Lantern: Rebirth, Hal Jordan's murderous actions were revealed to be the result of being under the influence of the fear entity Parallax. Parallax chose Hal at the behest of Sinestro (who was puppeteering a hard-light duplicate of himself in the battery during their battle on Oa). Jordan is eventually resurrected and returns as a Green Lantern once more, as well as resuming his career as a Captain within the United States Air Force. His and the Guardians' return signify the rebirth of the Green Lantern Corps. Behind the scenes Originally \\"Emerald Twilight\\" was scripted by Gerard Jones and according to Previews Vol. III #8 (Aug 1993) and the November 1993 Comics Scoreboard, was to involve two sets of the extraterrestrial altruists known as the Guardians and Hal Jordan, a member of their intergalactic police force, the Green Lanterns, having to choose which set was real. DC Editorial did not think this idea was interesting enough to draw new readers so then-publisher Paul Levitz, along with senior group editors Mike Carlin, Dennis O'Neil, and Archie Goodwin, and Green Lantern editor Kevin Dooley plotted the \\"Emerald Twilight\\" story. It was given to Ron Marz to write. In other media *\\"Emerald Twilight\\" was to be adapted into a video game for the Super NES by developer Ocean Software. The game would have allowed players to assume the role of Kyle Rayner and take on Hal Jordan. The game was cancelled. *Bat-Mite mentions Emerald Twilight on Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham.

The basic ingredients are barley flour, salt, and water, though many varieties exist which incorporate other staples. It was once generally eaten in all meals, most often with cured herring and cold boiled potato, often along with sour cream and/or butter.

Description It was a near copy of the German Wechselapparat (\\"Wex\\") from 1917. The Mark 1 was used as a training weapon, while the improved Mark 2 was used in action. Over 7,000 units were produced from 1943 to 1944. They were ready for service during Operation Overlord (the Allied invasion of Normandy). The Ack Pack was a harness carrying a doughnut-shaped fuel container with a capacity of 4 Imperial gallons (18 litres) of fuel on the operator's back. In the middle of the \\"doughnut\\" was a spherical container holding nitrogen gas as a propellant, which was pressurized to 2,000 lbf/in¬≤ (140 Bar). This was sufficient to propel the burning fuel 120 feet (36 metres). A hose from the fuel tank passed to the nozzle assembly which had two pistol grips to hold and aim the spray. The back grip had the trigger. In some versions the nozzle was fitted with a 10-chambered cylinder which contained the ignition cartridges. These could be fired once, each giving the operator 10 bursts of flame. In practice this gave 10 one-second bursts. It was also possible to spray fuel without igniting it to ensure there was plenty splashed around the target, then fire an ignited burst to light up the whole lot. At some the flamethrower was considered heavy. Popular culture A flamethrower of this type can be seen in the film A Bridge Too Far, when the British troops decide to try a night assault on the Arnhem bridge, after their first daylight assault fails. The assault team misses the pillbox slit, instead igniting the shack behind the pillbox which explodes, as it has apparently been used to store ammunition. One of the operators is British actor Alun Armstrong.

His early life and his relationship with Dora Carrington were the inspiration for Gilbert Cannan's novel Mendel. The characters of Loerke in D. H. Lawrence's Women in Love, and Gombauld in Aldous Huxley's Crome Yellow were based on him.  Early life  Queen of Sheba, 1922 Marks Gertler was born on 9 December 1891 in Spitalfields, London, the youngest child of Polish Jewish immigrants, Louis Gertler and Kate \\"Golda\\" Berenbaum. He had four older siblings: Deborah (b. 1881), Harry (b. 1882), Sophie (b. 1883) and Jacob \\"Jack\\" (b. 1886). In 1892 his parents took the family to his mother's native city, Przemy≈õl, Austria- Hungary (now Poland), where they worked as innkeepers. Though Louis was popular with his customers, mainly Austrian soldiers, the inn was a failure. One night without telling anyone Louis simply left for America (c.1893) in search of work. He eventually sent word to Golda telling her that once he was settled she was to bring the children to live with him there. However, this venture also failed and his family never joined him in America. Instead Louis returned to Britain, and had his family join him in London in 1896, when Marks' forename was anglicised as \\"Mark\\". From an early age Gertler showed signs of a great talent for drawing. On leaving school in 1906, he enrolled in art classes at Regent Street Polytechnic. Unfortunately, due to his family's poverty, he was forced to drop out after a year, and in December 1907 began working as an apprentice at Clayton & Bell, a stained glass company. He disliked his work there and rarely spoke of it in later years. While there he attended evening classes at the Polytechnic. In 1908 Gertler was placed third in a national art competition; this inspired him to apply for a scholarship from the Jewish Education Aid Society (JEAS) to resume his studies as an artist. The application was successful. Upon the advice of the prominent Jewish artist William Rothenstein, in 1908 he enrolled at the Slade School of Art in London. During the four years he spent at the Slade, Gertler was a contemporary of Paul Nash, Edward Wadsworth, C. R. W. Nevinson, Stanley Spencer and Isaac Rosenberg, among others. During his time at the Slade, Gertler met the painter Dora Carrington, whom he pursued relentlessly for many years. His obsessive love for Carrington is detailed in his published letters (see bibliography below) and in Sarah MacDougall's book Mark Gertler. It is also represented in the feature film Carrington (1995). His love for Carrington was unrequited, and she spent most of her life living with the homosexual author Lytton Strachey, with whom she was deeply in love. Carrington's unconventional relationship with Strachey, of whom Gertler was extremely jealous, and her eventual marriage to Ralph Partridge, destroyed her equally complex relationship with Gertler. He had been so distraught when he learned of Carrington's marriage that he tried to purchase a revolver, and threatened to commit suicide. Career Merry-Go-Round, 1916 Mark Gertler with T. S. Eliot (left) and his patron Lady Ottoline Morrell Gertler's patron was Lady Ottoline Morrell, through whom he became acquainted with the Bloomsbury Group. She introduced him to Walter Sickert, the nominal leader of the Camden Town Group. Gertler was soon enjoying success as a painter of society portraits, but his temperamental manner and devotion to advancing his work according to his own vision led to increasing personal frustration and the alienation of potential sitters and buyers. As a result, he struggled frequently with poverty. In 1914 the polymath art collector Edward Marsh became Gertler's patron. The relationship between the two men proved a difficult one, as Gertler felt that the system of patronage and the circle in which he moved were in direct conflict with his sense of self. In 1916, as World War I dragged on, Gertler ended the relationship due to his pacifism and conscientious objection (Marsh was secretary to Winston Churchill and patron to some of the war poets). Gertler's major painting, Merry-Go-Round, was created in the midst of the war years and was described by Lawrence as \\"the best modern picture I have seen\\". Gilbert Cannan at his Mill, 1916 Gertler's former home at 32 Elder Street, Spitalfields, marked with a blue plaque in 1975 by the Greater London Council In 1913 Gertler met the author and poet Gilbert Cannan, who later described him as \\"a small passionate man with green eyes\\". Cannan subsequently invited Mark to stay with him and his wife Mary at their Mill House in Cholesbury and the two men became good friends. Gertler lived there on and off during 1915‚Äì16, and painted Gilbert Cannan at his Mill (now on view in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford). The picture depicts Cannan outside the Mill with his two dogs. The black and white one, Luath, had been the inspiration for the dog Nana in the stage production of J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan. It was Cannan who was responsible for introducing Lady Ottoline Morrell to Gertler's paintings and encouraging her to support his work. Cannan closely based the young Jewish character of his 1916 novel Mendel on Gertler's early life including his infatuation and affair with fellow artist Dora Carrington. This relationship remained unfulfilled as Carrington spurned his numerous advances and instead declared her love for Lytton Strachey. The friendship of Cannan and Gertler waned after 1916, largely because of Cannan's increasingly unstable behaviour. Virginia Woolf recorded her impressions of Gertler after he came to visit her and her husband in Sussex in September 1918. As he left they cried, > \\"Good God, what an egoist!\\" We have been talking about Gertler to Gertler > for some 30 hours; it is like putting a microscope to your eye. One molehill > is wonderfully clear; the surrounding world ceases to exist. But he is a > forcible young man; if limited, able & respectable within those limits; as > hard as a cricket ball; & as tightly rounded & stuffed in at the edges.

I don't see that, because in my case I have a sense > which other people don‚Äôt have ... I saw in a moment what she had never > dreamt of seeing ...\\" & so on. And if you do slip a little away, he watches > very jealously, from his own point of view, & somehow tricks you back again. > He hoards an insatiable vanity. I suspect the truth to be that he is very > anxious for the good opinion of people like ourselves, & would immensely > like to be thought well of by Duncan [Grant], Vanessa [Bell] & Roger [Fry]. > His triumphs have been too cheap so far. However this is honestly outspoken, > & as I say, he has power & intelligence, & will, one sees, paint good > interesting pictures, though some rupture of the brain would have to take > place before he could be a painter. Gertler's later works developed a sometimes very harsh edge, influenced by his increasing ill health. In 1920 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, which forced him to enter a sanatorium on a number of occasions during the twenties and thirties. Two of Gertler's close friends, D. H. Lawrence and Katherine Mansfield, succumbed to the disease. In 1930 Gertler married Marjorie Greatorex Hodgkinson, which resulted in the birth of a son, Luke Gertler, in 1932. The marriage was often difficult, punctuated by the frequent ill health of both, and with Gertler often suffering from the same feelings of constraint that destroyed his relationships with a number of friends and patrons. During the 1930s he became a part-time teacher at the Westminster School of Art in order to supplement his intermittent income from painting. Gertler gassed himself in his London studio in 1939, having attempted suicide on at least one occasion in 1936. He was suffering at the time from increasing financial difficulties, his wife had recently left him, he had held a critically derided exhibition at the Lefevre Gallery, he was still depressed over the death of his mother and Carrington's own suicide (both in 1932), and he was filled with fear over the imminent world war. He was buried at Willesden Jewish Cemetery. Legacy Gertler's obituary in The Times described his death as \\"a serious loss to British art. Opinions of his work are likely to vary\\", it conceded, \\"but it is safe to say that a considered list of the half-dozen most important painters under fifty working in England would include him\\". Gertler's paintings are held in numerous public art collections, including in the Glasgow Museums. In June 2015 his 1912 painting The Violinist was auctioned for ¬£542,500 at Christie's, London a record for the sale of his work. The house bears a blue plaque erected by the Greater London Council in 1975; while set into the pavement in front of it is a cast-iron roundel created by sculptor Keith Bowler in 1995, depicting a detail from Gertler's Merry-Go- Round.

W. W. Birch, 1874 The Perak War (1875‚Äì76) took place between British and local forces in Perak, a state in northwestern Malaysia. The sultan of Upper Perak and other local chiefs attempted to end foreign influence in the region and remove the British administrator James W.W. Birch. Following the murder of Birch in 1875, British forces were sent in to end local resistance. The start After the murder of James W. W. Birch, the Malays first planned on attacking Bandar Bahru on the night of 2 November, but it is aborted due to heavy rain. British reinforcements started to arrive from Hong Kong and Burma by the 6th. A skirmish happened near a Malay-held stockade near Bandar Tua, Perak on 7 November 1875 involving around 106 British soldiers. This was the first battle in the war. Encountering unexpected resistance, the battle ended with the retreat of the British detachment, who lost 4 men including Captain Innes, an officer. Reinforcements were sent, and 300 men soon arrived in the state with 80 boats. Most of the army were sent from India and Hong Kong. The Siege of Pasir Salak On the 15th, the British army arrived at Pasir Salak. The place was well defended, with a fort that had a six-foot rampart, coupled with a wooden wall on top and with a trench filled with sharpened spikes and traps. The warriors had several lantaka with them, alongside some muskets. The British attacked relentlessly, but the first attack failed, killing Captain Innes. Soon, the attacks gave fruit, and it was captured on 12 December. Pasir Salak was razed by the soldiers under orders from William Jervois. The Battle of Kota Lama Kanan The warriors, under Dato Maharaja Lela, soon retreated to Sayong. The British followed them, attacking enemy forts and villages on the way. Then, on 4 January 1876, they were ambushed at Kota Lama Kanan, Sayong. Brigadier H.J. Hawkins was killed during the fight. Last days of the war Soon, the warriors began to lose strength. By mid-1876, the war ended with the capture of prominent leaders and warriors, such as Sultan Abdullah II, Dato Maharaja Lela, and Ngah Ibrahim. The first was captured and hanged in Matang with two followers in 1877, while the latter two were exiled to the Seychelles. Thus ended any direct opposition over British control of Perak.

The overarching story of this book deals with the effects on society when normal people begin sprouting angelic wings. The story follows two main characters; Alexander 'Zander' Wiles is a petty crook suffering from acute agoraphobia, and Cassandra 'Cassie' O'Conner, a psychiatrist specializing in 'angels' and author of a pop-psychology book titled Angel Blues. Both live and work around Detroit, Michigan, and much of the story takes place either in Detroit or its suburbs. The book starts somewhere in the middle. Zander is attempting suicide by trying to jump off the smokestack of an industrial plant. Cassie is at the same plant intending to do a little night flying. Zander succeeds in knocking himself unconscious and breaking a wing. Cassie drags him to shore and calls paramedics, eventually having to instruct them on how to set the broken bones. Roughly half of the book is involved with Zander and Cassie's backgrounds. Zander grew up in the shadows of industrial plants. His father died under mysterious circumstances and his stepfather locked Zander out when he turned 18. Zander quickly fell under the influence of a class-mate of his, a small-time drug dealer who soon taught Zander about running from the police and how to tell a good stash from a bad one. Zander eventually became a drug runner in his own right until he started undergoing some of the preliminary changes of 'angelism'. As the condition was completely unknown at the time, he thought he was simply dying and holed up in a rent-a-cottage facility, ordering in pizza and beer. Eventually, when he began growing the hard green casing that is the first visible sign, he realized he had something new and became an all-out hermit. Once the wings had sprouted, Zander contacted his old drug buddy and the pair worked out a scam to get money from elderly people. Zander would pretend to be the Angel of Death, but announced that he could be put off by a monetary donation. It wasn't until the pair encountered another angel, this one dead for several weeks, that Zander realized that he wasn't alone. He assaulted his drug buddy, went to a talent agency and became a talk show star. Eventually, this too became tiresome and he once again became a hermit. Cassie's story quite different. Her mother was a bisexual sculptor and a single parent. When Cassie's uncle left them an old farm, they moved out to the farmhouse and Cassie's mother continued her sculpting. Cassie and her mother were always outsiders in the community, never quite able to fit in and never quite wanting to, either. Eventually, Cassie moved to Ann Arbor and started attending the University of Michigan's medical college. While she was there, she 'contracted' angelism and speant her time in a 'coop,' a safehouse run by other angels where you could transform in security. Returning to school, Cassie realized that she didn't really want to become a medical doctor, but still wanted to help people. She chose to become a psychiatrist, and specialized in angels. Cassie's book Angel Blues is considered the definitive work on angel psychology (largely because there is no other work on angel psychology) but Cassie believes herself to be a fake; she claims she wrote the book to \\"meet Oprah.\\" After having a falling out with her patients and her colleagues, she was diagnosed as a flying addict and received treatment for it. This is roughly the time when she saved Zander's life, and he set up a meeting between them to work on his agoraphobia. Working with Zander re-enthused Cassie to get back to working with her regular patients. She began treating Zander's old drug buddy, who had partially transformed into an angel. To be precise he was a 'penguin,' an angel without the extensive nerves in his wings and lacking a sense of balance when upright. Therefore, he had to shuffle around the ground on all fours or be pushed in a wheelchair. Zander takes on the case, declaring that 'he doesn't need a psychologist... he needs an engineer.' Using a series of counterbalances and a walker, he gets his buddy on his feet again and effectively cures penguinism. It's about this point where Zander and Cassie begin really exploring the possibilities of a sexual relationship, beyond doctor-patient and friend-friend.

During mid 1943 he flew missions in North Africa with the Polish Fighting Team attached to No. 145 Squadron. He claimed one Bf 109, one 'probable, and two damaged at this time. In July 1943 he returned to No. 306 as a flight commander, and in August was posted to No. 303 Squadron, claiming a FW-190 on 17 August. In June 1944 he took command of the Polish No. 316 Squadron. He shot down 2 V-1 flying bombs in mid 1944, and a Bf 109 on 14 August 1944. On 6 September 1944 he was forced to bail out over the Netherlands due to his Mustang suffering engine failure. He was interned as a prisoner of war in the German town of Barth.Those Other Eagles, Shores , 2004, page 24 After his release from internment in 1945 he returned to England. In 1947 he moved with his English wife Beryl and daughter to Communist Poland - Wroc≈Çaw, Warsaw and finally Dobrzan√≥w, where he joined his mother. Like many other Poles who had fought in the armed forces of the Western Allies, he suffered repression from the new (Moscow-controlled) government of the People's Republic of Poland until 1956. Between 1944 and 1973 he wrote forty four books, mostly on wartime aviation, including his memoirs, with four million copies sold overall. Bohdan Arct died suddenly in 1973 at the age of 59.

Princess Charlotte Bay is a part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and it is a habitat for the dugong. Reefs in the bay are described as pristine. Barramundi habitat and associated wetlands exist in declared green zones which restrict commercial fishing. History The bay is in the traditional lands of the Bakanambia and Jeteneru people. The bay was named after Princess Charlotte of Wales by Lieutenant Charles Jeffreys of the British Royal Navy in 1815.Princess Charlotte Bay. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved on 10 June 2011. Princess Charlotte Bay and surrounds were devastated by the shrek Mahina Cyclone of 1899 which destroyed all 100 ships moored there at the time. Other estimates suggest a lower figure of 82 boats destroyed. On the 4 March 1899, the entire North Queensland pearling fleet was in the bay where they regularly collected supplies and unloaded shells. Around 100 Aboriginals who were assisting survivors ashore and 307 men from the pearling fleet were drowned in Queensland's worst maritime disaster. Geography The most easterly point of the bay is Cape Melville. Also in this area is Flinders Island, part of the Flinders Group. The bay's most westerly point is Claremont Point. Normanby, Bizant, North Kennedy, Marrett and Morehead rivers terminate in the bay. Marine fossils and old beach ridges have been discovered well inland along the river systems. This indicates the bay has been experiencing a gradual infilling. During spring tides salt water inundates low areas for several kilometres inland. Mixed mangrove forests predominate in tidal areas. The adjacent wetlands are one of the largest in Australia. Extensive areas of seagrass beds exist on the bay's seafloor. There are also large areas of tidal flats covered in sand and mud. Protected areas around the bay include Cliff Island National Park, Lakefield National Park and Cape Melville National Park. The best boat access to Princess Charlotte Bay is from the Bizant boat ramp which is 20 km from Bizant. Fauna The Bizant river shark is a rare species of fresh or brackish water shark. More common marine species found in the bay include barramundi, blue salmon, grey mackerel, queenfish, grunter, mangrove jack, tiger prawn and mud crab. Both Princess Charlotte and nearby Bathurst Bay have some of the highest densities of dugong in Queensland. A Special Management area has been established in Princess Charlotte Bay. It aims to protect the dugong from commercial net fishers by limiting the number of fishing permit holders.

He is the father of the businessman Robert Earl. Career He began his singing career at local functions around London's East End, and soon progressed to singing with some of the top big bands of the day such as those of Sidney Lipton, Nat Temple and Van Straten. In 1953, he auditioned for Norman Newell of Philips Records and was offered a recording contract. In 1957 he had a contract with George Baines and Will Hammer and starred in \\"Big Splash\\", an Aqua Show at The Derby Baths, Blackpool for the summer season. He enjoyed three chart hits during this period, while signed to Philips: \\"I May Never Pass This Way Again\\" (#14) and \\"More Than Ever\\" (\\"Come prima\\") (#26) in 1958 and \\"The Wonderful Secret of Love\\" (#17) in 1959. His agent was Michael Sullivan, who also represented Shirley Bassey. After a 20-year career as a professional singer he retired in 1970, and then devoted much of his time to the Grand Order of Water Rats, a showbusiness charitable organization.

He was a Utopian thinker, a believer in both science and magic, and a figure-head for the Social Credit movement in British politics. Early life Born in Midhurst, Sussex, into an itinerant Quaker family,Hargrave section of Kibbo Kift website (webarchive) and Ross and Bennett (2015) Chapter 4. Hargrave was the son of painter Gordon Hargrave and his wife Babette Bing, of Jewish Hungarian descent.H. F. Oxbury, \\"John Hargrave\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography A bohemian childhood, spent partly in the Lake District, left him with a passion for Nature and a fierce propensity for self-education through reading books and observing the world around him. In 1908, the family moved to Latimer where in 1909 Hargrave joined the First Chorleywood Scouts, a group of Baden Powell's Boy Scouts. In 1910 his career as a published book illustrator began when a few of his vignettes appeared in an edition of Gulliver in Liliiput, published by Thomas Nelson & Sons, a commission almost certainly arranged through the patronage of Lady Chesham. He was also given a year-long trial as a cartoonist on the Evening Times. He became a devotee of the naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton, and one of the leading Scout authorities on Woodcraft. His interests in scouting, nature and art combined to produce the book that made his name, or rather his scouting name of 'White Fox'. This was Lonecraft published by Constable in 1913 and introducing the characteristic 'White Fox' style of no-nonsense text, interspersed with pictures and diagrams. Rising up the Scout hierarchy, Hargrave produced a succession of scouting and woodcraft books for C. Arthur Pearson Ltd, who offered him a position of staff artist in 1914, his first salaried job. Kibbo Kift When World War I broke out, Hargrave joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and saw action at the Battle of Gallipoli. Hargrave's Quaker pacifism was reinforced by the horrors of war. The experience convinced him that modern civilisation had gone awry and he voiced his feelings in his angry polemic of 1919, The Great War Brings It Home. This was a call to action for all groups concerned with the health and character of future generations. Hargrave called for a new national scheme for character-building and physical training, and the result was the foundation of the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift in August 1920. Intended as a movement for all ages and genders, the Kibbo Kift provided a co-educational, and therefore progressive, alternative to the Boy Scouts. Hargrave was initially appointed 'Head Man' as a temporary measure, but by 1924 had succeeded in becoming the undisputed leader. As Head Man, he imported into the Kindred his interest in ritual and art, along with his own views about self-education, science, magic, and healthy behaviour. He was a strong believer in Darwinian evolution, holding that Kibbo Kift training would produce morally upright and healthy individuals, through whom the human species as a whole would evolve into a better state. He believed that building better individuals was the way of building a better society, thus standing apart from those on the left and right who believed in the State as the main vehicle for social change. Hargrave's vision of the better society to come owed much to his Quaker roots: he saw a future society without war, poverty or wasted lives, all kept together by the self-discipline of enlightened individuals. The Kindred of the Kibbo Kift took its name from an old Kentish term for a feat of strengthJohn Hargrave ‚Äì \\"White Fox\\" retrieved 28 Sep 2012. and it attracted support from a number of progressive thinkers, including: Patrick Geddes, Evelyn Sharp, H. G. Wells, and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence. Membership remained fairly small (600‚Äì800) in the 1920s and included many teachers, art teachers and youth workers. Many developed an intense personal loyalty to Hargrave, remaining with him throughout the Kindred's transformation into the Green Shirts, and the Social Credit Party. Artist and writer In the 1920s Hargrave's work as an artist was dominated by the designs, drawings and diagrams he produced for the Kibbo Kift. All express his fascination with 'symbology', the use of symbols or stylised representations to convey meaning. He controlled the visual style of the movement, designing the 'official' robes, badges, symbols, theatre sets and regalia himself: although individual members were encouraged to design and make their own personal totems. He had less success as an artist outside the movement, despite trying to establish himself as a portrait or landscape painter. In 1924 he exhibited a selection of his 'symbolic paintings' 'an attempt to express through the medium of paint Ideas rather than Objects in themselves'.Quoted in Ross and Bennett, op cit., p.33 During the late 1920s and 1930s, he worked as a freelance commercial artist in the advertising industry, producing layouts for Lever Brothers, whose advertising manager Colin Hurry was a friend; and for Carlton Studios, where he worked on campaigns for Watney's and Boot's the Chemist among others. He continued to sell illustrations to book publishers, including some cover work for Mills & Boon in 1922. Hargrave enjoyed more public success as a novelist, publishing a best-seller Harbottle: A Modern Pilgrim's Progress from This World to That Which is to Come in 1924, and following it with a succession of popular novels published by Duckworth's. Many are stylised fables borrowing structures from books that Hargrave admired: Harbottle is based on John Bunyan, and Young Winkle (1926) is based on Rudyard Kipling's Kim. Entirely original, however, is Hargrave's experimental modernist masterpiece Summer Time Ends (1935). This symphonic text aspired to the condition of radio and film, weaving its characters' speech in and out of refrains and rhythms. The book was well received in America (John Steinbeck was a fan), and was praised by Ezra Pound, by this time an admirer of Hargrave. Social Credit In 1924 Hargrave was introduced to the economic theory of Social Credit, the creation of C. H. Douglas. Hargrave took up the creed with fervour, attracted by its seemingly- scientific 'truth' and its sense of mission. Social Credit changed Hargrave's belief in the reformed individual as the key to a better society: the key was actually, he now believed, a reformed economic system. By the late 1920s he had re-purposed the Kindred to be a 'megaphone' for social credit, bringing the esoteric economic theory to the public at large.Ross and Bennett, op cit, p.108 reproduces a Kibbo Kift cartoon of 16 November 1928 showing the Kindred in the role of a 'New Economic Megaphone'. The remaining Kibbo Kift members were transformed into a fighting force, still disciplined and healthy but now engaged in 'unarmed military technique'. Hargrave joined up with the Legion of the Unemployed in Coventry in 1930, and furnished them with green shirts and berets. By 1932, the Kibbo Kift were also in the green uniform, together forming the Green Shirt Movement for Social Credit. The Green Shirts soon became part of the street politics of the 1930s, engaging in battles with both Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists, the Black Shirts, and the Red Shirt supporters of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Hargrave designed a striking new flag for his Social Credit movements, the green and black double K device, which he christened the 'Key Symbol'.Examples of the use of the key symbol as a brand can be seen on items from the Museum of London's collections: see the 'Collections Online' section of www.museumoflondon.org.uk He also introduced a strong element of theatricality into the Green Shirts' political protest, with ritual marches round the Bank of England, drumming, 'street chalking' and publicity stunts such as throwing a green brick into 11 Downing Street. Initially staying out of parliamentary politics, Hargrave changed his mind in 1935, re-branding the Green Shirt movement as the Social Credit Party of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the purposes of fighting the 1935 General Election. He was also impressed by the success of the Social Credit Party of Alberta (Canada). Douglas opposed the entry of the movement into parliamentary politics. Hargrave soon travelled to Alberta, frustrated at the lack of progress that the Social Credit government there was making. He was appointed an economic adviser to the Government of Alberta and was disowned by Douglas. He left Canada in 1936, returning to find the Social Credit Party in disarray after the Public Order Act 1936 banned the wearing of uniforms by non-military personnel. Undeterred, Hargrave steered the Social Credit Party into a more evangelical mood, adopting quasi-religious slogans ('God's Providence is Mine Inheritance') and organising public 'Services of National Regeneration'. He broke with Ezra Pound, an episode which underlined his opposition to Fascism. The Social Credit Party was mothballed during the war, although Hargrave tried to keep his ideas alive through a weekly newsletter,The Message from Hargrave. He was urged to stand for Parliament in the 1945 election, but did not: only returning to public politics in 1950 when he stood as a candidate in Hackney North and Stoke Newington in the 1950 general election. The 551 votes he received convinced Hargrave to give up, and by 1951 he had disbanded the Party. Inventor, healer and cartoonist In 1937 Hargrave became obsessed with solving the technological problems of using maps in moving aeroplanes. By 1938 a prototype of the Hargrave Automatic Navigator was ready to file with the Patent Office and articles of association had been prepared for 'Hargrave Aviation Ltd.'. The prototype was tested during the war, with government approval, but lack of capital meant that the invention was not developed further. The invention lay fallow until 1976 when Hargrave sued the British Government, claiming that the moving map display supplied by Britain to the supersonic Concorde, was, in fact, his Automatic Navigator. His claim was taken up by journalists,see, for example, Tony Crooks, The Sunday Times 11 February 1973. resulting eventually in a Public Enquiry. Hargrave insisted he was only asking for recognition, rather than any financial recompense, but the Public Enquiry found against him. During the war, Hargrave had returned to his interest in science and magic (he always considered both as equally valid methods for harnessing the forces of nature). He became convinced of his own powers and set up as a healer, offering a variety of techniques. Chief among these were the use of 'Therapeutic Psychographs', abstract artworks created by Hargrave which were prescribed to his patients with instructions to stare at the artwork for a set period of time every day.Some of his psychographs are reproduced on the Museum of London website (Collections Online) or Ross and Bennett, op cit., pp.136‚Äì7 In the 1950s Hargrave earned a living as a cartoonist, working under the name of 'Spiv' or sometimes just 'H'. His work appeared in Cavalcade, The Sketch and Time and Tide.some of his cartoons are reproduced in Ross & Bennett, chapter 5 He was commissioned to write the entry on Paracelsus for the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (Hargrave had published The Life and Soul of Paracelsus in 1951). He submitted a stream of manuscripts, radio plays and film scripts to producers and publishers, always searching for opportunities to realise his ideas:His many unpublished manuscripts from the 1950s and 1960s are all held in the Hargrave Mss. at the British Library of Political and Economic Science. he continued to believe that Social Credit was the solution to the world's economic problems. John Hargrave died on 21 November 1982, aged 88 at his home in Branch Hill Lodge, Hampstead. Personal life and surviving papers Hargrave married Ruth Clark, the daughter of the engineer William Clark on 28 November 1919. Their marriage produced one son although the couple were divorced in 1952. He remarried in 1968, his new wife being the actress Gwendoline Florence Gray. John Hargrave's personal papers, including his diaries and unpublished mss., are held at the British Library of Political and Economic Science.

They are also one of three tribes that formed the population of Essaouira, Morocco. The Regraga came from the Jbel Hadid mountains and introduced Islam to the region; the other tribes were the Berber Haha and the Chiadma. In Tachelhit, the term Regraga refers to those who are imbued with the spiritual force called Baraka. The tribe became known by this name because in pre-Islamic times they held a prominent religious role in the region, and because of it were considered nobility. In modern times, the term also refers to a pilgrimage made annually by the Chiadma tribes of the Jbel Hadid and the Haha tribes who live southeast of Essaouira. It takes place in spring and lasts 40 days. During those weeks, pilgrims visit a series of local shrines, from the mouth of the Tensift river south of Safi to the northern outskirts of the High Atlas, including the city of Essaouira itself. They join either of two different groups on a tour of the shrines, stopping at each shrine on the way. One group must adorn at every shrine a holy tent made of fan palm fibres and dyed with henna, the other group arrives in a procession with a muqaddim (religious leader) riding a white horse.

She was the wife of Maharaja Kharak Singh and mother of Nau Nihal Singh, her only son. In 1840 Kharak Singh and Nau Nihal Singh were assassinated and, on the grounds that Nau Nihal Singh's widow Sahib Kaur was pregnant, Chand Kaur staked her claim as regent for the unborn successor to the throne. She remained regent for approximately two-and-a-half months, from 5 November 1840 to 18 January 1841, but abandoned her claim when Sahib Kaur delivered a stillborn son. She was awarded a pension of 900,000 rupees and for a while lived in her late son's palace in Lahore. However her enemies still saw her as a threat and she was battered to death by her servants on 11 June 1842. Life Maharani Chand Kaur, Empress of the Sikh Empire Chand Kaur was born in 1802 into a Jat sikh Sandhu family in Fatehgarh Churian in the Gurdaspur District of Punjab. Her father was Sardar Jaimal Singh, chief of the Kanhaiya Misl. In February 1812, at the age of ten, she married Raja Kharak Singh, the eldest son of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Their son, Nau Nihal Singh, was born on 23 February 1821 and in March 1837 he married Sahib Kaur, daughter of Sham Singh Atarivala. =Reign of son= After the death of Ranjit Singh on 27 June 1839, Kharak Singh was appointed as his successor and Raja Dhian Singh Dogra as his wazir (vizier). The new Maharaja only ruled for a few months until October 1839, when he was overthrown in a coup by his son, Nau Nihal Singh, and Dhian Singh. He was imprisoned at Lahore until his death in November 1840 from slow poisoning. Contemporary chroniclers suggest that the poison had been administered under DhiƒÅn Si·πÖgh's orders. Returning from the cremation of his father on 5 November, Nau Nihal Singh went through the gate of the Hazuri Bagh with his companion Udam Singh, son of Gulab Singh, and Dhian Singh's nephew. As they passed through the gate stones fell from above, killing Udam Singh and injuring the prince. Dhian Singh, who was a few steps behind, immediately arranged for the prince to be taken into the fort. Nobody else was allowed into the fort, not even his mother, Chand Kaur, who beat on the fort gates with her bare hands in a fever of anxiety. Eyewitnesses stated that before he was taken into the fort the prince appeared to be only slightly injured, was conscious and asked for water. However, when his mother and friends were allowed in to see him, he was dead with severe injuries to his head. =Reign= After the deaths of Kharak Singh and Nau Nihal Singh, Dhian Singh supported the claim of Sher Singh, the son of Ranjit Singh's estranged first wife, Mehtab Kaur. Chand Kaur turned to Gulab Singh for support. A compromise was proposed that Chand Kaur should adopt Sher Singh's son Pratap Singh. However, she pointed out that Nau Nihal's widow, Sahib Kaur, was pregnant and might give birth to a rightful successor. The arrival in Lahore of two powerful opponents of Sher Singh, Sardar Atar Singh Sandhanvalia and Sardar Ajit Singh Sandhanvalia, settled the matter. On 2 December 1840 Chand Kaur was proclaimed Maharani of the Punjab, with the title Malika Muqaddasa, Empress Immaculate. On 13 January, Sher Singh arrived in Lahore. The regiments outside the city walls went over to his side, leaving Chand Kaur with 5,000 men and a limited quantity of gunpowder against a force of 26,000 infantry, 8,000 horse and 45 guns. Chand Kaur's troops in the fort fought for two days, but Dhian Singh arrived on the evening of 17 January and arranged a ceasefire. Chand Kaur was persuaded to accept a pension and relinquish her claim to the throne, and on 27 January Sher Singh was formally anointed as Maharaja. =Retirement and assassination= The dowager Maharani retired to her late son's palace in Lahore and received a pension of rupees. In July 1841 Sahib Kaur's son was stillborn, ending any justification for a renewed claim to the regency. However she had made an enemy of Dhian Singh, who replaced her servants, who killed her on 11 June 1842 by smashing her head in with wooden pikes. The samadhi of Maharani Chand Kaur is in the grounds of Islamia College at Civil Lines in Lahore, on the same platform as, and to the south of, the samadhi of Kharak Singh's mother Maharani Datar Kaur, lovingly called Mai Nakain by Ranjit Singh. In between the samadhis of the two maharanis is the smaller samadhi of Sahib Kaur.

His most important role was as the Head of Drama at BBC Television from the late 1960s until 1981, a role he occupied for longer than anyone else. Early life Sutton's father, Graham Sutton, was a theatre critic and novelist as well as being a teacher at Latymer Upper School, where Sutton himself was educated. His mother was an actress, and Sutton followed in her footsteps by enrolling in drama school after leaving Latymer. However, the coming of the Second World War interrupted his career and he joined the Royal Navy, seeing action in the Mediterranean and attaining the rank of Lieutenant. Following the end of the war, Sutton returned to the theatre, but increasingly moved toward writing and producing rather than acting, apparently on the advice of his mother. Later in life, he would claim that this advice had saved him from becoming \\"an ageing, mediocre actor\\". In the late 1940s he met the actress Barbara Leslie, to whom he was married until his death.He had four Children one boy and three girls.Though he hasn't met them all and now can't he has four grandchildren. Television career Sutton moved into television, the medium with which he was to become most closely associated, in 1952, joining the staff of the BBC's drama department. He found particular success in children's serials, writing and directing the likes of Queen's Champion (1958) and Bonehead (1960). In 1963, the new Head of Drama at the BBC, Sydney Newman, offered Sutton the job of being the first producer for the new science-fiction series Doctor Who, but Sutton declined. One of his reasons for declining the role was that by this stage Sutton was beginning to make a name for himself in more adult drama series, directing several early episodes of the highly acclaimed police drama Z-Cars from 1962. He worked as a director on other drama series such as The Last Man Out, The Troubleshooters and the Z-Cars spin-off Softly, Softly until 1966, when he moved into the upper echelons of the drama department by succeeding Gerald Savory as Head of Serials. In this position, Sutton commissioned and oversaw some of the most prestigious of all BBC drama productions of the era, including in 1967 the epic twenty-six episode adaptation of John Galsworthy's The Forsyte Saga, commonly held to be one of the most successful BBC drama productions of all time. After Sydney Newman left the BBC at the end of 1967, Sutton was appointed to succeed him as overall Head of Drama, initially on an acting basis combined with his Head of Serials role, and then from 1969 on a permanent basis. He was to occupy the position for the next twelve years, until 1981, overseeing the entirety of the BBC's 1970s drama output. This era is commonly held to be one of the most successful in all BBC drama, described by The Guardian in their obituary of Sutton as being when \\"the golden age of television drama reached its zenith\\". Or in the words of the Royal Television Society in their obituary, \\"Unmatched by any other television organisation, BBC Television drama, under Shaun, offered in its schedules every shape, style and form of drama. It was a theatrical spectrum of extraordinary width and choice\\". Sutton's reign saw success in many different styles and genres - there were continuing long-running successful and popular series such as Z-Cars and Doctor Who; the eclectic mix of styles and stories in the much- praised anthology strand Play for Today; and prestige serials such as The Six Wives of Henry VIII (1970), I, Claudius (1976) and Dennis Potter's Pennies From Heaven (1978). There were, however, also low points, such as the embarrassing failure of Churchill's People (1974), a twenty-six part series based on Winston Churchill's A History of the English Speaking Peoples. Sutton deemed the production to be unbroadcastable upon seeing the result, but so much time, money and effort had been spent on making and publicising the series that he was left with little choice in the matter. There were also controversies surrounding the 'banning' by his superiors, against Sutton's wishes, of two entries into the Play for Today strand, Dennis Potter's Brimstone and Treacle in 1976 and Roy Minton's Scum in 1978. Nonetheless, Sutton himself was seen as having been a great success in his role, and when he finally departed in 1981 he was not short of further work in the department. He returned to front-line producing duties, taking over the BBC's The Complete Dramatic Works of William Shakespeare series, which had been initiated by producer Cedric Messina under Sutton's aegis in the late 1970s. Sutton produced all of the remaining works between 1982 and 1986, some thirteen plays in all, including some of the less frequently performed plays. He continued to work as a producer following the end of this run and into the late 1980s, mostly of theatrical adaptations for BBC2. His final work was as the producer of an adaptation of Mary Stewart's novel Merlin of the Crystal Cave in 1991, after which he retired to the country cottage in Norfolk which he and his wife had bought in 1970. Honours and private life Sutton was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), for his services to broadcasting, in 1979. In 1982, he published a book, The Largest Theatre in the World, about his experiences of working in the drama department of the BBC. Married to Barbara Leslie from 1948 until his death, they had four children, all of whom survived him. He died following a short illness in May 2004.

Background At the age of twelve he was sent abroad to complete his education, and resided at the principal universities of Germany, the Netherlands, France, Italy, and Switzerland for seventeen years. On his return he found both his parents dead, and was appointed the guardian of his eleven young brothers and sisters, in which capacity, profiting by the spoliation of the church, he accumulated immense riches. Career His extraordinary financial abilities and pronounced political capacity soon found ample scope in public life. In 1552 he was raised to the dignity of Rigsraad (councillor of state); in 1554 he successfully accomplished his first diplomatic mission, by adjusting the differences between the elector of Saxony and Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg. The same year he held the post of governor of Copenhagen and shared with Byrge Trolle the control of the treasury. A few years later he incurred the royal disfavour in the administration of public property. In the spring of 1557, Oxe and the king quarrelled over a mutual property exchange. Failing to compromise matters with the king, Oxe fled to Germany in 1558 and engaged in political intrigues with the adventurer Wilhelm von Grumbach for the purpose of dethroning Frederick II in favor of Christina of Lorraine, the daughter of Christian II. But the financial difficulties of Frederick II during the stress of the Northern Seven Years' War compelled him, in 1566, to recall the great financier, when his confiscated estates were restored to him and he was reinstated in all his offices and dignities.Christian III, Peder Oxe and the 1557 Meeting (Den danske historiske Forening) A change for the better immediately ensued. The finances were speedily put on an excellent footing, means were provided for carrying on the war to a successful issue (one of the chief expedients being the raising of the Sound Dues) and on the conclusion of peace, Oxe, as lord treasurer, not only reduced the national debt considerably, but redeemed a large portion of the alienated crown-lands. He reformed the coinage, developed trade and commerce and introduced numerous agricultural reforms, especially on his own estates, which he was never weary of enlarging, so that on his death he was the wealthiest landowner in Denmark. Oxe died on 24 October 1575, after contributing more than any other statesman of his day to raise Denmark, for a brief period, to the rank of a great power.

He was also a social activist who worked to achieve conditions that might minimize the threat of nuclear war. Biography Berkeley received a BA in Mathematics and Logic from Harvard in 1930. He pursued a career as an insurance actuary at Prudential Insurance from 1934‚Äì48, except for service in the United States Navy during World War II. Berkeley saw George Stibitz's calculator at Bell Laboratories in 1939, and the Harvard Mark I in 1942. In November, 1946 he drafted a specification for \\"Sequence Controlled Calculators for the Prudential\\", which led to signing a contract with the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation in 1947 for one of the first UNIVAC computers. Berkeley left Prudential in 1948 to become an independent consultant when the company forbade him to work on projects related to avoiding nuclear war, even on his own time. He sometimes wrote using the pseudonym \\"Neil D. MacDonald\\". He became famous in 1949 with the publication of his book Giant Brains, or Machines That Think in which he described the principles behind computing machines (called then \\"mechanical brains\\", \\"sequence-controlled calculators\\", or various other terms), and then gave a technical but accessible survey of the most prominent examples of the time, including machines from MIT, Harvard, the Moore School, Bell Laboratories, and elsewhere. In Giant Brains, Berkeley also outlined a device which some have described as the first \\"personal computer\\", Simon. Plans on how to build this computer were published in the journal Radio Electronics in 1950 and 1951. Simon used relay logic and cost about $600 to construct. The first working model was built at Columbia University with the help of two graduate students.Simon fact sheet originally published by Columbia University Retrieved April 10, 2007 Berkeley founded, published and edited Computers and Automation, the first computer magazine. He also created the Geniac and Brainiac toy computers. In 1958 Berkeley joined the Committee for a SANE Nuclear Policy (SANE).  Computer Art  On the title page of the magazine \\"Computers and Automation\\", January 1963, Edmund Berkeley published a picture by Efraim Arazi from 1962 as Computer Art. This picture inspired him to initiate the first Computer Art Contest in 1963. Berkeley had coined the term Computer Art. The annual contest was a key point in the development of computer art up to the year 1973. This way Edmund Berkeley became a pioneer in the field of computer art.http://dada.compart- bremen.de/item/Publication/206Herbert W.

Nelson appears on three tracks. In 2016, the album was released as a remastered, double vinyl record by Folktale Records. History In making her first solo album, Bozulich didn't want \\"the pressure of having to write all new music. \\"I'm a storyteller, and it's a folktale, and I felt like I wanted to bring that tradition to life. I started doing it with a drone box and guitar, but quickly Nels [Cline] got involved and helped me realize some of my ideas, and then his group the Nels Cline Singers jumped in.\\" Jenny Scheinman was added as one of the clarifying members during the recording session, playing the violin and adding vocals. There are also backing vocals by Carla's big sister, Leah Bozulich on the song, \\"Blue Eyes Cryin' In The Rain\\". Carla has stated that the addition of electronic tambura drone box and the melding of Middle Eastern melodies with traditional country parts was a re-action to the US invasion of Iraq after 9/11, as the group was preparing to record. The first performance of Carla's Red Headed Stranger was in 2002 at the Los Angeles club, The Smell. Alan Sparhawk from Low showed up knowing the whole album by heart and proceeded to sit in on the entire fledgling performance.

Bozulich understands implicitly: legend is for extrapolation, and ultimately for re-visioning in a new place and time.

He was born in Venice of good family, though not of the same house as the famous doges, and began his career as a physician. He was a prominent opponent of the oligarchical party in the revolution which took place on the approach of Napoleon; and he was one of the envoys sent to seek the protection of the French. When the request was refused, and Venice was placed under Austria, he removed to Milan, where he was made member of the great council. In 1799, on the invasion of the Russians and the overthrow of the Cisalpine republic, Dandolo retired to Paris, where, in the same year, he published his treatise Les Hommes nouveaux, d'op√©rer une r√©g√©n√©ration nouvelle. But he soon after returned to the neighborhood of Milan to devote himself to scientific agriculture. In 1805 Napoleon made him governor of Dalmatia, with the title of prov√©diteur g√©n√©ral, in which position Dandolo distinguished himself by his efforts to remove the wretchedness and idleness of the people, and to improve the country by draining the pestilential marshes and introducing better methods of agriculture. When, in 1809, Dalmatia was re-annexed to the Illyrian provinces, Dandolo returned to Venice, having received as his reward from the French emperor the title of count and several other distinctions. He died in Varese on 13 December 1819. Dandolo published in Italian several treatises on agriculture, vine-cultivation, and the rearing of cattle and sheep; a work on silkworms, which was translated into French by Fontanelle; a work on the discoveries in chemistry which were made in the last quarter of the 18th century (published 1796); and translations of several of the best French works on chemistry.

Controversy =Political impartiality= In 2007, Ofcom fined Islam Channel ¬£30,000 for breaking the broadcasting code by having Yvonne Ridley present news programmes while standing as a candidate in local elections for the Respect Party during the previous year. Ofcom also condemned the channel for not providing requested recordings. In 2008, Yvonne Ridley was awarded ¬£20,532 in compensation and ¬£5,000 in costs after an employment tribunal upheld her complaint that she was unfairly dismissed, was sexually discriminated against and harassed whilst working at the station.https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/31/yvonne- ridley-islam- channelhttps://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/apr/21/pressandpublishing3 Two cases from 2009 were also punished by Ofcom, for not including an Israeli perspective on discussion of the Arab-Israeli conflict.

A presenter is reported to have said during one programme: \\"it shouldn't be such a big problem where the man feels he has to force himself upon the woman\\", while in another a speaker told a viewer who was phoning in: \\"In Islam we have no right to hit the woman in a way that damages her eye or damages her tooth or damages her face or makes her ugly. Maximum what you can do, you can see the pen over here, in my hand, this kind of a stick can be used just to make her feel that you are not happy with her.\\" The channel was not fined but Ofcom stated: \\"the advocacy of any form of violence (however limited)... is not acceptable\\" and that \\"it was highly likely that any advocacy and support at all of forced sexual relations would be offensive\\". During the program Muslimah Dilemma, Western laws and freedoms were attacked, and that women should not be \\"permitted to hold a position of leadership in government\\". =Anwar al-Awlaki= In 2010 it was reported that Islam Channel had in 2009 carried advertisements for DVDs of radical al-Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki's sermons and for at least two events at which he was due to be the star speaker via video link.

Life =King of Syria= Youngest son of Antiochus II and Laodice I, he was thirteen when his father died in 246 BC. That death led to the Third Syrian War. A year later, probably under the influence of his mother,Justin, Epitome of the Phillipic History of Pompeius Trogus, XXVII Antiochus demands the possession of Asia Minor from his brother Seleucus II Callinicus and quickly declares his independence in order to expand his territory and his authority. Seleucus, struggling against the ptolemaic forces, has no choice but to accept. =War of the Brothers= In 241 BC, Seleucus made peace with Ptolemy III Euergetes and then tried to recover the territories his brother took from him. Ready for the war, Hierax sought the help of two strong allies : Mithridates II of Pontus and Ariarathes III of Cappadocia and thus constitutes a vast coalition of Anatolian states : Cappadocia, Bithynia and a certain number of Galatians. After a first loss in Lydia, he decimated his brother's army in the Battle of Ancyra in ca. 239 BC Overtoom, \\"The Power-Transition Crisis of the 240s BCE and the Creation of the Parthian State,\\" The International History Review Volume 38, 2016 - Issue 5.

Attalus defeated the Gauls and Antiochus at the battle of Aphrodisium and again at a second battle in the east. Subsequent battles were fought and won against Antiochus alone: in Hellespontine Phrygia, where Antiochus was perhaps seeking refuge with his father-in law,Justin, Epitome of Pompeius Trogus, xxvii. 2-3; Polyaenus, Stratagemata, iv. 17; Eusebius, Chronicon (Schoene ed.), pag. 251; Pompeius Trogus, Prologi, 27; Ziaelas of Bithynia; near Sardis in the spring of 228 BC; and, in the final battle of the campaign, further south in Caria on the banks of the Harpasus, a tributary of the Maeander.Hansen, Esther V.

He briefly served as the commander of No. 317 Polish Fighter Squadron; he was shot down on his first mission over France on August 27, 1944. In 1931, Gny≈õ entered military service with the Polish Air Force. In 1933 he began air training in Grudziadz and later in 1936, was a flying instructor at the Polish Air Force Academy at Dƒôblin. During the war he scored six victories - three solo and three shared - in the Polish and French campaigns. The defense of Poland, September 1939 By May 1939 Gny≈õ had been posted to the 121st Eskadra Mysliwska (121st Fighter Escadrille) in the city of Krak√≥w, equipped with obsolete PZL P.11c fighters. On 31 August the Squadron was assigned to operate with the III/2 Dywizjon (Group) and it relocated to a reserve airfield in Balice. In the early morning of 1 September 1939, Gny≈õ was woken by a German bombing raid on Krak√≥w. At about 7 am (according to other sources, 5:30 am) Gny≈õ flew a sortie with Cpt , the Group Commander. Just after take off and at about 300 meters altitude the Polish fighters were suddenly attacked by a pair of German Ju 87B dive-bombers from I/StG 2 \\"Immelmann\\". Unteroffizier Frank Neubert successfully fired at Medwecki and scored probably the first aerial victory of the war. The P-11 fell away having suffered serious damage, and Medwecki was killed. Gny≈õ was now also under attack, but later shot at a \\"Stuka\\" piloted by Lt. Brandenburg. The German aircraft started to smoke, but managed to return to base at Nieder- Ellguth. A few minutes later Gny≈õ attacked two Do 17E bombers from KG 77. After a few passes both Do 17 bombers crashed in the country village of ≈ªurada, near Olkusz. One of the German bombers was coded \\"3Z+FR\\" on its fuselage and all six crew members were killed, one later identified as a Uffz. Klose. On his return to base Gny≈õ met a lone He 111, but he was out of ammunition. There is controversy regarding these victories. According to , based on German wartime sources two Do 17Es from 7./KG 77 did crash near ≈ªurada, but this was caused by a Polish anti-aircraft artillery, which damaged one Do 17 which then collided with the other. The Polish Aviation Museum in Krak√≥w has the only surviving PZL P.11c fighter from the September campaign. Among other armaments, it has four 7.92 mm machine guns. An examination of a fragment from one of the downed Dorniers revealed at least four clearly defined bullet holes having the same diameter to the ammunition on board Gny≈õ's PZL P.11c fighter. Taking into account the bullets' angle of entry and the resulting damage, their diameters match up within one mm of the 7.92. This would conclude that the two Do 17s were not brought down by anti-aircraft fire because shrapnel from an exploding shell does not leave neat holes, but rather jagged and irregular size punctures. The combat in which Medwecki was shot down took place in 5:30-6:00 am and, according to Emmerling, Gny≈õ only fired at the Ju 87, but did not hit it, nor did he meet Do 17s. Other authors however, claim that damage to one of the Do 17s which resulted in a collision with the other, might have been caused by Gny≈õ.Marius Emmerling: Pierwszy zestrza≈Ç w kampanii wrze≈õniowej 1939 r. - Mit ppor.pil.

Gny≈õ was responsible for the first Allied aerial victories of the war.

France 1940  After the fall of Poland, Gny≈õ fled to France and served as a pilot with the French Air Force. Flying the Morane MS 406-C with GC III./1 and stationed at Toul Croix, Gny≈õ scored three shared victories; a He 111 on 12 May and two Do 17s on 16 May. After the French surrender, Gny≈õ escaped via Oran and Casablanca and arrived in Liverpool on 14 July 1940.  With the RAF 1940-44  Gny≈õ later fought with the Royal Air Force, joining No. 302 Squadron as a Pilot Officer on 17 August 1940 and seeing combat in the Battle of Britain and into 1941. On 21 May 1941 Gny≈õ' Hawker Hurricane was badly damaged by fighters although he managed to return to base. Later he served with the No. 316 Polish Fighter Squadron flying Spitfires and No. 309 Polish Fighter-Reconnaissance Squadron, flying tactical reconnaissance Mustangs. On 22 August 1944, he was appointed to the command of No. 317 Polish Fighter Squadron. Two days later, Gny≈õ was shot down over Rouen by flak, was wounded and captured by German forces. Despite his wounds, he escaped from a POW field hospital a few days later, found by the French Maquis and returned to the Allied lines safely. He settled in Canada after the war.

Set in the fictitious Derbyshire village of Shepherd's Delight during Harold Wilson's first term as Prime Minister (1964‚Äì1970), Oh My Darling Daughter is about the Kembles, a well-to-do, conservative and church-going family of five, and in particular about Viola, the eponymous daughter of the house who, at 17, suddenly finds herself in a position of having to care for the rest of the family when her mother Clementine walks out on them after a row with her husband. Plot summary This unforeseen event occurs at the beginning of summer, when Viola has just finished school. St. Winifred's, her \\"Alma mater\\", is an expensive public school which prides itself on turning out \\"ladies\\"‚Äîrefined young women who are mostly \\"unemployable\\" and have certainly not been taught domestic subjects but who will nevertheless, it is believed, have no problem finding suitable husbands among their own social class. Secretly, Viola has already made her choice in this respect: She intends \\"to marry the Reverend Mr Chisholm and have ten children\\". Now she is waiting for Chisholm to respond to her subtle, ladylike advances. However, at the same time she is in charge of the household, tending to her father Harry, who writes articles on literature; her twelve-year-old sister Persephone (\\"Perse\\"), who also goes to St. Winifred's; and her five-year-old brother Nicholas Anthony (\\"Trubshaw\\"). Their large house, The Old Vicarage, has not been renovated in a long time, which has started to show in places and does not make life easier for them. (They have named the spare bedrooms after the problems that have befallen them: Dry rot, Woodworm, the Mildew Room.) While they are slowly adjusting to their new life without Mother, Clementine Kemble occasionally informs them about her current whereabouts‚Äîthey get cheery postcards from such faraway places as Marrakesh, Cairo, Istanbul, Samarkand, Kuala Lumpur, Eureka, California, Los Angeles, and Acapulco. When Harry Kemble thinks they cannot cope alone any longer he hires Gloria Perkins, a friend of his wife's, to keep house for them. However, Gloria turns out to be not only dim-witted but also spectacularly incompetent as a housekeeper‚Äîthe only dish she can prepare is goulash‚Äîwhile at the same time she is a young unattached and very attractive woman. Gossip among the villagers that she might be Harry Kemble's \\"mistress\\" seems inevitable, especially when people find out about her loose morals. (\\"Gloria wouldn't recognize a moral principle if it was served up to her on a plate, with chestnut stuffing\\".) Even the Reverend Chisholm seems to be attracted to Gloria and succeeds in involving her in various church activities. Just as Viola starts becoming slightly suspicious of the two Chisholm, to her great and pleasant surprise, proposes to her, adding that the responsible thing to do will be to wait for a year or two for them to get married. Nevertheless, in seventh heaven now, Viola discards any ideas of continuing her association with Johnnie Wrighton, a friendly young man who has obviously fallen in love with her but whom she considers definitely beneath her as he is the son of ordinary farmers. On Christmas Eve, six months after having bolted from Shepherd's Delight, Clementine Kemble makes a surprise appearance at The Old Vicarage. Looking out of the window, the Kembles see a beautiful woman clad in mink alighting from a London taxi, her baggage in tow. Only gradually does Harry Kemble accept it when his wife informs him that she has made up her mind to stay for good now. Immediately she takes over the regime again, having been used all her life to getting her way in all decisions big and small, whether they concern her own person or another family member. She gets rid of Gloria Perkins by inviting her husband's literary agent for the weekend and having her run off with him back to London without even doing so much as saying good-bye; she subtly prepares for the family's move from Derbyshire to the island of Sark, where she has just inherited a beautiful house but where no one except herself wants to go and live; and she vehemently forbids Viola to marry Chisholm. When Perse gets into trouble by sending poison pen letters to a number of villagers Clementine Kemble once more takes the initiative. To protect her girl from being found out she deliberately spreads the rumour that it was her husband who, allegedly in a temporary state of overwork and confusion, has written and dispatched them. Harry Kemble is furious when she tells him, but at the same time can do nothing about it except thinking about relocating to another part of the country‚Äîmaybe Sark. The tragic aspect of Perse's bizarre adolescent prank is the ensuing suicide attempt of Agnes Buttle, a middle-aged spinster accused by Viola, herself the recipient of an anonymous letter (\\"Leave him alone or I'll kill you\\"), of writing the letters. However, as it soon turns out, Agnes Buttle has had other reasons for being desperate, first and foremost the Reverend Chisholm's abominable behaviour. To further his career in the Church, he made advances to Buttle, whose uncle was a bishop, although she is more than ten years his senior. When that uncle died, he dropped her. Chisholm has also fallen in love with Gloria Perkins and only proposed to Viola to avert attention from his association with Gloria. Viola considers it an important step in her journey from \\"green girl\\" to full-fledged adult when she breaks off her engagement and calls Chisholm a \\"poor little bastard\\". At the beginning of April, shortly before Viola's 18th birthday, the Kembles finally move to Sark. By now Viola has realised that she loves Johnnie Wrighton, but her mother already has other plans for her. Viola is to get a job in Berkshire as a receptionist for a distant uncle of hers who is a GP there. That way, Clementine Kemble assures her, she will meet many eligible young men to choose from. Only by means of a \\"ruse\\"‚Äîshe tells her little sister that she got pregnant from a day tripper to the island‚Äîcan she eventually convince her mother, who for an awful moment loses her poise and fears that it actually might be true, that they are now on the same footing. At the end of the novel Johnnie Wrighton proposes to Viola, and Clementine Kemble not only gives her consent but also surprises them by giving them The Old Vicarage as a wedding present. Quotes * Viola discussing her planned marriage to Chisholm with the Vicar: > \\"How do your parents feel about this?\\" > \\"They don't know, yet. But they won't mind.\\" > He said earnestly, \\"I wouldn't be too sure of that. You're awfully young, > you know.\\" > \\"I'm seventeen. Juliet was only thirteen.\\" > \\"My dear child, look what happened to her.\\" * Viola kissing Johnnie Wrighton for the first time: > \\"I moved closer, and pressed my lips tenderly against his; at last we began > to stroll back to the car, our arms round each other's waists, my head on > his shoulder, his lips in my hair. The moon went with us, jigging over the > treetops, leering a bit now, I thought. I wished I knew what was supposed to > happen when we got back to the car. St Winifred's had been as reticent about > this as about Economics.\\" *Viola discussing her future job in Berkshire with her parents: > \\"Now, Viola dear, no more arguments. You'll thank me for this when you've > got three beautiful children and a husband you adore. Won't she, Harry?\\" > \\"Always provided she doesn't have them in that order,\\" chuckled Father. > There are times, I must admit, when I actively dislike Father. He'll sell > his own daughter down the river, just so that he can make a silly, and > rather coarse, joke. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations Oh My Darling Daughter was filmed in West Germany in 1974 as Als Mutter streikte (When Mother Went on Strike). The film was directed by Eberhard Schr√∂der and starred Peter Hall (as \\"Dr. Harry Kemper\\"), Johanna Matz (Clementine), Belinda Mayne (Viola), Gila von Weitershausen (Gloria), and Elisabeth Flickenschildt (Aunt Clarissa).

It is also about a mother who leaves her family because she believes she cannot cope any more. Like in Malpass's novel, the first person narrator is a 17-year-old girl who realises that it is now up to her to replace her mother and manage the affairs of the whole family.

It was one of the first battles of the Invasion of Poland, of the Second World War and one of the few Polish victories of that campaign, as well as the first German defeat of the conflict.Zaloga, S.J., 2002, Poland 1939, Oxford: Osprey Publishing Ltd., Eve of the Battle According to the Polish mobilization scheme, the main task of the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Army was to secure the connection between the Krak√≥w Army operating in Silesia and Lesser Poland and the Pozna≈Ñ Army defending Greater Poland. It was also to cover the mobilization of a reserve Prusy Army behind the Polish lines. Because of that, the main purpose of the army was to gain time and offer delaying actions and harsh resistance in order for the mobilization to be accomplished. The Wo≈Çy≈Ñska Cavalry Brigade was located north of the town of K≈Çobuck, along the railway to Katowice. Two regiments (19th Volhynian Uhlan Regiment and 21st Vistula Uhlan Regiment, as well as 4th battalion of the 84th Infantry Regiment) were entrenched on both ends of a forest surrounding the village of Mokra, to the west of the north- south rail road line. To the east, Colonel Julian Filipowicz placed the reserves of the brigade: 12th Podolian Uhlan Regiment, 2nd Mounted Rifles Regiment and 21st Armoured Battalion. The main task of the Polish brigade was to keep the connection between the 7th Infantry Division (Poland) operating to the south and the 30th Infantry Division (Poland) to the north. The terrain chosen by the Polish commander was ideal for defence: a railroad earthwork and a forest formed the main defensive line while the foreground was hilly, with a large number of ditches, streams and other obstacles. Battle On September 1, at 0500, the German Tenth Army of Army Group South crossed the Polish border and initiated the invasion of Poland. The German 31st Infantry Division, as well as 1st and 4th Panzer Divisions crossed the border in the operational sector of the Polish Volhynian cavalry brigade. After breaking through small Border Guard and National Defence detachments, the German units seized the towns of Krzepice and Starokrzepice, directly in front of the main Polish positions. After capturing them, the Germans razed both towns and expelled all the local inhabitants towards the Polish lines. The German units were divided into three separate assault groups. The 1st Panzer Division headed directly towards the town of K≈Çobuck, held by the Polish 7th Infantry Division, while the 4th Panzer Division was split into northern and southern columns, each trying to outflank the Polish positions around Mokra. At the same time, the Luftwaffe began a heavy bombardment of the Polish positions. By the end of the day, German aircraft made 15 attacks, with 9 to 26 bombers in each. The planes were mostly Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers. At 0630 in the morning the motorcycle reconnaissance squads of the 4th Panzer Division made contact with the 12th company of the 84th Infantry Regiment under Stanis≈Çaw Radajewicz. Soon afterwards the AFVs arrived, supported by infantry and purportedly using Polish civilians as human shields. However, after several hits from Polish AT weapons on their flanks, the German tanks lost orientation, which allowed the civilians to cross the Polish lines with negligible losses. The German assault was renewed shortly afterwards, but was repelled by heavy machine gun fire. Two AFVs retreated, while the majority of the motorcyclists were taken prisoner. The 4th Panzer Division then mounted an assault on the Polish 21st Uhlans Regiment, further northwards. After a short artillery barrage and aerial bombardment, the German tanks took the village of Wilkowieck and headed directly for the village of Mokra. However, although the regiment lost many horses and approximately five ammunition cars, the bombs mostly missed the Polish defensive positions and the advancing tanks were welcomed at 150 metres by well-positioned Polish-made 37mm Bofors antitank guns. After two Panzers were destroyed, the German tanks withdrew to 400 metres and started shelling the Poles with artillery, but after losing two additional AFVs (one destroyed and one immobilized), the German tanks retreated. The German infantry were left on a flat open field, right in front of the Polish positions, without any cover. They were forced to retreat by a Polish infantry attack that caused heavy losses and resulted in a number of prisoners being taken by the Poles. The positions of the 19th Uhlans Regiment were attacked at 0800 by an assault group composed of tanks, AFVs, motorcyclists and infantry. The German group, divided into three columns, was advancing towards the village of Rƒôbielice Szlacheckie in order to outflank the 21st Regiment from the north. However, the Germans were apparently unaware of the 19th Regiment's positions. The westernmost group easily captured the village, but the central group was caught in an ambush by the Poles near the forest and had to flee. The third group was advancing alongside the Polish positions in the forest, completely unaware of the Polish forces several hundred metres away. When the Polish machine guns and anti-tank guns opened fire, the group was almost annihilated before it could respond. Nevertheless, the Polish northern flank was endangered and the Germans had uncovered its positions. To counter the threat, Col. Filipowicz ordered the 12th Uhlans Regiment under Andrzej Kuczek, until then held in reserve, to strengthen the positions of the 19th Regiment. The newly arrived units were fresh, yet already battle-hardened in the first skirmishes in the early morning, which helped Polish morale. The German Assault Monument to the Vohynian Cavalry Brigade in Mokra At 1000 hours, the Germans started an assault on the northern flank, but were repelled from most positions with significant losses on both sides. Fifteen minutes later the German 4th Panzer Division repeated the attack, this time with artillery support and air cover. The assault was planned in three directions: # Towards the positions of the 19th Regiment and to the north, in order to outflank the brigade # Towards the village of Mokra itself, with approximately 100 tanks and AFVs # Towards the weakened 4th Battalion of the 84th Infantry Regiment The northern assault was carried out quickly. Under heavy covering fire, the German tanks, a mixture of Panzer Is and Panzer IIs, managed to break into the forest and secured a road leading across the railway line to the village of Izbiska Du≈ºe, to the north of the Polish headquarters. At 1030, the Polish 4th Squadron of the dismounted 19th Cavalry Regiment was attacked from behind and pushed out of the forest. This threatened the separation of their 19th and 21st Regiments. Colonel Filipowicz ordered the 19th Regiment to withdraw to the other side of the railway, but the way was already occupied by German tanks and the unit was effectively surrounded. However, the Polish defence was reinforced by the arrival of the Armoured train No. 53, known as ≈ömia≈Çy (\\"Bold\\"), which arrived on the battlefield just as the German tanks were crossing the railway line. It stopped in the middle of the German column and opened fire on the German tanks at close range with its two 75mm guns and heavy machine guns. The German column was dispersed and retreated with heavy losses, losing a number of Panzer I and II tanks, while the 19th Regiment crossed the railroad under cover of the armoured train. Although the 19th Regiment suffered heavy losses, it managed to regroup on the other side. Simultaneously, a German attack on the main positions of the 21st Regiment near the village of Mokra began. German tanks managed to outflank the 4th Squadron of the Regiment from the north, at the same time attacking it frontally. The Polish defenders were pushed out of the forest and heavy fighting for the village itself started. The Germans lost four tanks to the Polish 2nd Artillery Battalion firing from across the railway, but the 4th Squadron was in retreat, fighting for almost every house in the village and suffering heavy losses. Again the day was saved by ≈ömia≈Çy. It arrived in the area at the height of the battle and opened fire from a distance of almost 2.5 km, which was beyond the effective range of all German tank guns of the time, in the end destroying or knocking out several more Panzer I and IIs. Also, more Polish cavalry, made up of the 12th Uhlans Regiment, was moved to the area; the men dismounted and reinforced the 21st Regiment. Polish counter-attack and the \\"Charge\\" The 21st Armoured Battalion under Maj. Stanis≈Çaw Gli≈Ñski, equipped mostly with Polish TKS tankettes was ordered to counter-attack the village, along with the cavalry squadron of Captain Jerzy Hollak. In the clouds of smoke of the burning village, the Polish units accidentally drove right into the middle of a German tank column. Although the Polish tankettes were no match for the heavier Panzer II German tanks and the cavalry was very vulnerable to tank fire, the confusion in German ranks prevented their commander from responding quickly enough. The Polish units managed to break through the German column with negligible losses and seized the forest to the northwest of Mokra. This manoeuvre is sometimes referred to as a Polish cavalry charge against German tanks, although no charge was planned nor executed. Nevertheless, the German tanks again lost orientation and the column withdrew from the village, again leaving it in Polish hands. The tanks withdrew to their initial positions in Wilkowiecko, leaving behind the infantry supporting the failed assault. German losses were high and a large number of German troops were taken prisoner. At the same time, also at 1000, the positions of the 4th Battalion of the 84th Infantry Regiment were attacked by a detachment of German mechanized infantry. After initial clashes the Polish 11th and 12th Companies withdrew deeper into the forest. Colonel Filipowicz ordered the 2nd Mounted Rifles to counter- attack and strengthen the positions between the 21st and 84th regiments. Also the 10th Company managed to charge the enemy and retake the positions lost only a couple of minutes earlier. By noon, the fighting in the centre and in the south of the Polish positions was over. The fighting in the forest on the northern flank was ended after the 19th Regiment successfully withdrew. Final struggles Polish map of the Battle of Mokra; In blue - position of the units of Volhynian Cavalry Brigade on 1 September 1939. Red - the German attack. At 1215 approximately 100 German tanks returned to the village of Mokra. The main assault broke the lines of the 4th squadron of the 21st Regiment and the tanks managed to charge the AT artillery nests, destroying two of the guns and breaking through to the central part of the village. The houses there were set on fire and the 21st Regiment managed to withdraw to the rail line, under cover of the smoke. Only isolated pockets of resistance were left in the village itself, which caused much confusion to the Germans. The withdrawal of the 21st Regiment allowed the Germans to attack the 12th Regiment and the 2nd Artillery Battalion directly. The losses of the latter unit were high since most of the 75 mm field guns were not the best weapon for antitank fire. The 2nd battery lost all three guns and the HMG, while the 5th battery lost two guns. However, the rest of the artillery positions were covered with smoke from the burning houses the Germans had set afire, and were successfully hidden. When a group of tanks unknowingly approached the 1st battery, the Polish guns used direct fire on the German tanks, destroying thirteen of them in a matter of minutes. This allowed the Poles to hold their positions. The 12th Regiment under Andrzej Kuczek attacked the German tanks from the rear, from the previously-retaken forest to the Northwest of the village. Although both sides suffered heavy losses, the Germans withdrew. After the assault ended, the 2nd Artillery Battalion was withdrawn from the battle due to heavy losses and lack of ammunition. At 1500, the Germans repeated the frontal assault with heavy artillery fire, tactical air attacks and almost 180 tanks from Wilkowiecko. Simultaneously, side attacks were commenced on the Polish flanks. The frontal assault was directed on the 2nd Squadron of the 12th Regiment (commanded by Stanis≈Çaw Raczkowski), in the centre of the village. Although the Polish artillery destroyed many of them, the German tanks managed to break through again to the village. The 4th squadron under Feliks Pruszy≈Ñski counter-attacked, but both squadrons were being constantly pressed towards the rail line. Colonel Filipowicz had no further reserves and the German tanks were nearing the railway crossing, while the Polish cavalry was being pushed back with heavy losses. Soon the regiments lost contact with each other. Because of the smoke, the battle broke down to a series of different skirmishes in the forests, the village and along the rails. All batteries but one of the 2nd Battalion were withdrawn from the battle. This made the situation of the 12th Regiment critical. The 2nd Mounted Rifle Regiment, the only unit that was still intact and in contact with the commander of the brigade, was ordered to assault at all costs and reinforce the 12th Regiment and the gap between the cavalry and the 84th Regiment in the south. This helped the Polish defence, but only for the moment. Colonel Filipowicz ordered the Polish tankettes to charge the German tanks in the village. Although the tankettes were not supplied with antitank ammunition, in the chaos of the battle they managed to halt the German advance temporarily. After losing one tankette the Poles withdrew, but managed to gain enough time for the armoured trains to return to the area. To the north, at the positions of the 19th Regiment the tanks also managed to break through and started crossing the railroad near Izbiska. When the German tanks crossed the line, both of the armoured trains arrived and attacked them from behind. While the losses in tanks were limited, the panic that started in German units resulted in many tanks being abandoned by their crews, who could not drive the tanks directly through the railway tracks (elevated some two metres above the ground); the crossing was blocked by burning AFVs. Although both trains suffered some losses and were finally forced to retreat, the panic in German ranks was not stopped. In the smoke some of the German tanks started firing at German positions, while others simply retreated towards their initial position, directly through the German infantry. In the south the Polish infantry was yet again pushed deeper into the forest, but its lines were not broken. By 1700 the battle was over. Aftermath The German 4th Panzer Division was forced back to its initial positions in Opat√≥w and Wilkowiecko, and only the 12th Sch√ºtzen Regiment managed to reach the rail road crossing at Izbiska. However, upon learning that the German 1st Panzer Division had managed to take K≈Çobuck, the Polish forces were withdrawn overnight south- eastwards, to the village of ≈Åobodno located north-east of K≈Çobuck, and then to the second line of defence, some 12 km to the east. Casualties The losses on both sides were quite high. The Germans lost approximately 800 men (killed, captured, wounded or missing), and between 100 and 160 AFVs (at least 50 of them tanks). The Polish brigade lost 200 killed and 300 wounded, as well as 300 horses and several guns. The 2nd Mounted Artillery Battalion lost almost 30% of its men, the 21st Regiment almost 25%; the 12th Uhlans Regiment that was used as a reserve lost 5 officers and 216 men killed and wounded.

He served during the War of the Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War and the American War of Independence, rising to the rank of vice-admiral of the red. Family and early life Not much is known of Francis William's early life. He was born in Buckland Monachorum, Devon in 1724 and was baptized on 22 August that year. He was the third son, and the second surviving son, of Anne Heathcote and Sir Francis Henry Drake. This line of Drakes descended from the brother of Elizabethan naval hero Sir Francis Drake. Francis William is often confused with his younger brother, Francis Samuel, also a naval officer whose death occurred around the same time. All four sons of Sir Francis Henry Drake had Francis as their first name, which further adds to the confusion. The sons‚Äô names were, Francis Henry, Francis Duncombe, Francis William and Francis Samuel. Drake joined the Royal Navy at an early age (about 8 or 10). He was promoted to lieutenant, and then to commander on 18 October 1743. He commanded first the from April 1747 to January 1748. He was then promoted to post- captain on 29 January 1748 at the age of 23. That year he commanded during the War of the Austrian Succession. He went out the West Indies to serve under Charles Knowles, and came across the Spanish vessel St. Judea and captured her with her 108 crew. HMS Fowey was shipwrecked at the Florida Keys while towing the St. Judea to Virginia. An investigation was launched by the Admiralty, but all were exonerated on testimony that they were the victim of a strange current. North America From Fowey he was appointed to command in May 1749 until 1750 and in 1751 took command of the 24-gun . During this time he served under Commodore Sir George Rodney at Newfoundland and was sent into Conception and Trinity Bay's and as far north as Cape Bonavista where he had authority to hear appeals from decisions of fishing admirals and to enforce the various provisions of King William's Act of 1699. In 1750 Drake served as the de facto Governor of Newfoundland under Commodore Rodney, senior naval officer in 1750 and 1751, and was appointed to the position of governor in 1752. Governorship Drake was instrumental in making reforms in the Newfoundland justice system in the way that prisoners were incarcerated and the requirement that people charged with criminal offences had to be transported to England for trial. The instructions given to Drake were to appoint judges and commissioners oyer and terminer to hear all criminal cases except treason. After returning to England Drake had suggested additional reforms urging that the provision forbidding the execution of those convicted of criminal offences be changed. He suggested that a secure prison be built in St. John's as prisoners could easily escape or freeze to death while awaiting transport to England while incarcerated over the winter while the British cabinet determined their fate. Changes were granted including the right to execute prisoners found guilty of crimes. Seven Years' War Drake was appointed to command the 50-gun in October 1755, remaining in command until 1757, when he was succeeded by his younger brother, Francis Samuel. Francis William took command of the 60-gun in December 1758. He remained in command for the rest of the Seven Years' War. He was present at the Battle of Lagos on 18 August 1759 under Sir Edward Boscawen, the Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November 1759 under Sir Edward Hawke, and the Capture of Belle √éle between 4 and 8 June 1761 under Augustus Keppel. Drake then went out to the West Indies again, and was present at the Battle of Havana between 6 June and 13 August 1762 under Sir George Pocock, before retiring on half pay in 1763. Political career and further appointments Drake's elder brother, the fifth baronet, had previously represented Bere Alston in the House of Commons. He was appointed Master of the Household in 1771, and chose not to seek re-election. Instead Francis William was elected in his place, on 29 January 1771. He voted with the government on most issues, and did not seek re-election in the 1774 general election. He was promoted to rear-admiral of the blue on 23 January 1778 and rear-admiral of the red on 19 March 1779, taking up command in the Downs in 1779 during the American War of Independence. He flew his flag at first aboard the 60-gun between July and November 1779, and then aboard HMS Dromedary from November 1779 until 1781. He was promoted to vice-admiral of the blue on 26 September 1780 and was given command of a squadron of the Channel Fleet under Vice-Admiral George Darby. He hoisted his flag aboard the 100-gun and remained there until 29 December 1780. He flew his flag for a brief time in May 1782 aboard the 60-gun , and then transferred to the 60-gun . He does not appear to have gone out with her to the Mediterranean with the fleet to relieve Gibraltar under Admiral Richard Howe. Lord Sandwich offered him further commands in the fleet under Rodney, but severe attacks of gout forced him to decline, and he eventually struck his flag and went ashore. He was nevertheless promoted to vice-admiral of the red in September 1787, and raised his pennant on . Family and later life Gouache and pastel over pencil of Drake and wife, Elizabeth Heathcote, and their two daughters, Sophia and Marianne, by Daniel Gardner (1750‚Äì1805). Drake's family life is confused in later records with those of his younger brother Francis Samuel. He may have married, on 23 January 1788 in Ripley, the only daughter of George Onslow, for many years the member of parliament for Guildford. A special license was apparently required as she was a minor. The same fact is recorded though for his brother, and Pooley would have actually been thirty in 1788. Sir Lewis Namier's work, The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1754-1790, recorded that Francis William married his cousin, Elizabeth Heathcote, the daughter of Sir William Heathcote, 1st Baronet on 3 November 1763. They had two daughters; the elder Sophia (1765 - 14 June 1803), was mother of Peter, 5th Count de Salis-Soglio. Francis William Drake died in late 1788 or early 1789, or more likely December 1787.The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1754-1790, ed. L. Namier, J.

He is best known as the director (Festspielleiter) of the Bayreuth Festival, a position he initially assumed alongside his brother Wieland in 1951 until the latter's death in 1966. From then on, he assumed total control until he retired in 2008, although many of the productions which he commissioned were severely criticized in their day. He had been plagued by family conflicts and criticism for many years. He was the son of Siegfried Wagner, the grandson of Richard Wagner, and the great-grandson of Franz Liszt. Biography His mother, Winifred Wagner (n√©e Williams-Klindworth), was English. He was born at Wahnfried, the Wagner family home in Bayreuth in Bavaria. In addition to his elder brother Wieland (1917‚Äì66), he had an elder sister Friedelind Wagner (1918‚Äì1991), and a younger sister Verena Wagner (1920‚Äì2019). During the 1920s Winifred Wagner was an admirer, supporter and friend of the Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler, who became a regular visitor to Bayreuth. Wolfgang Wagner first met Hitler in 1923, when he was four years old, and the Wagner children were encouraged to call him \\"Uncle Adolf\\" or \\"Uncle Wolf\\" (his nickname). When Hitler became Chancellor in 1933, he showered favours on the Wagner family. Wolfgang was a member of the Hitler Youth but never joined the Nazi Party. He joined the German Army in 1939. During the Polish campaign he was severely wounded in the arm, and he was discharged as medically unfit in June 1940 (Hitler visited him in the hospital). Wagner married twice, to Ellen Drexel (1919‚Äì2002) and Gudrun Mack (1944‚Äì2007).\\"Schock in Bayreuth ‚Äì Gudrun Wagner tot\\". Der Spiegel (28 November 2007). Retrieved on 2 September 2012.

According to Gottfried's autobiography Twilight of the Wagners: The Unveiling of a Family's Legacy (1997, English version: 1999), his father told him in the 1950s: \\"Hitler cured unemployment and restored worldwide respect for the German economy. He freed our people from a moral crisis and united all decent forces. We Wagners have him to thank for the idealistic rescue of the Bayreuth festival.\\"cited by Martin Kettle, \\"The twilight of the Wagners\\", The Guardian, 8 June 2000 Eva was eventually named as his successor as the director of the Bayreuth Festival in conjunction with his preferred candidate, her half-sister Katharina, after the two women reached an agreement following the death of his second wife who was Katharina's mother.\\"Two Great-Granddaughters of R.

Career Wolfgang worked with his older brother Wieland Wagner in 1951 on the resurrection of the Bayreuth Festival following Germany's defeat in the Second World War. Since that time, the festival has run on an annual basis. On Wieland's death in 1966, Wolfgang became the sole director of the festival and, under his directorship, the famous Bayreuth Festspielhaus underwent extensive renovations. He stepped down on 31 August 2008 when the year's festival had finished.Catherine Hickley (29 April 2008). Bayreuth Festival Chief Wolfgang Wagner Steps Down (Update1). Bloomberg.com Both brothers contributed productions to the Bayreuth Festival, but Wolfgang did not enjoy the same critical reception as Wieland did. Like his brother, Wolfgang favoured modern, minimalist stagings of his grandfather's works in his productions. As director of the festival, Wolfgang commissioned work from many guest producers, including innovative and controversial stagings such as the 1976 production of the Ring Cycle by Patrice Ch√©reau. However, he confined the stagings at the festival to the last ten operas by his grandfather that make up the Bayreuth canon established under the direction of his grandmother Cosima Wagner. Wolfgang attracted some criticism for what was seen as his autocratic sway over the Festival,Tom Service (20 July 2007). \\"Wagner's guardian\\", BBC News. much of which comes from within the Wagner family itself. Wieland's daughters, Daphne and Nike Wagner, have accused their uncle of ill- treating their branch of the family, saying that he drove them and their mother out of Wahnfried, the family home, following their father's death and destroyed the scenery, models and correspondence with artists relating to their father's work. Wagner writer Barry Millington notes two rather inconsistent threads of criticism about Wolfgang's role in managing the presentation of the family's connection with the Nazis. Daphne accuses him of blackening her father's name by releasing information on Wieland's connection with the Bayreuth satellite of the Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp, while Wolfgang's own son, Gottfried, accuses him of having tried to suppress all information about the Wagner grandchildren's connection with the Nazis.Barry Millington, \\"Wagner wars ‚Äì the truth behind the long-running family saga\\" , Evening Standard, London, 9 September 2009 Moreover, Christian Kracht described \\"the likes of Wolfgang Wagner\\" as \\"bourgeois & enemy to Christoph Schlingensief.\\"Kracht, C., & Woodard, D., Five Years (Hanover: Wehrhahn Verlag, 2011), pp. 91, 94. Nonetheless, he helped make the Bayreuth one of the most popular destinations in the world of opera. There was a ten-year waiting list for tickets. In 1994, he invited Werner Herzog (who had staged Lohengrin at Bayreuth in 1987) to make a documentary about the festival, which was released under the title Die Verwandlung der Welt in Musik (The Transformation of the World into Music).\\"Addio a Wagner, nipote di Richard e direttore del Festival di Bayreuth\\", Quotidiano.net, 22 March 2010 Notes Sources * Further reading * Wagner, Nike: The Wagners: The Dramas of a Musical Dynasty.

Today it is overshadowed by its larger neighbour, Salisbury, but it still has a range of notable shops and attractions, including Wilton House. The confluence of the rivers Wylye and Nadder is at Wilton. History The history of Wilton dates back to the Anglo-Saxons in the 8th century AD, and by the late 9th century it was the capital of Wiltunscire, a shire of the Kingdom of Wessex. It remained the administrative centre of Wiltshire until the 11th century. Wilton was of significant importance to the church, with the founding of Wilton Abbey in AD 771 amongst other establishments. In AD 871 Alfred the Great fought and lost an important battle here against the Danish armies, leaving him in retreat for several years. Despite further attacks, Wilton remained a prosperous town, as recorded in the Domesday book. The building of Salisbury Cathedral nearby, however, caused Wilton's decline, as the new site of Salisbury, with a new bridge over the River Avon, provided a convenient bypass around Wilton on the trade routes. Wilton Abbey was surrendered to Henry VIII in 1539 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and in 1541 much of the estate was granted to Earl William Herbert of Pembroke, who began to build Wilton House. The Old Courtyard, Wilton Shopping Village. Part of the former Wilton carpet factory site now used as a shopping outlet By the 17th century, weaving had become a busy trade, and the carpet industry began in 1741 when two French weavers were brought in by Earl Henry Herbert of Pembroke to teach the local people new skills. Carpet weaving prospered until 1815, when peace following the Napoleonic Wars introduced European competition. Machinery to produce Axminster carpets was installed in 1835. The Wilton Royal Carpet Factory was founded at the turn of the century, with the help of the then Lord Pembroke, to rescue the previous carpet factory that had fallen into financial difficulty. The factory continued to operate until 1995, when it closed temporarily after a takeover. The factory re-opened, although it was unable to retain the Wilton Royal prefix. An outbreak of smallpox in 1737 killed 132 people. Wilton had two railway stations. One (later known as ) was opened by the Great Western Railway in 1856 on their line from Westbury to Salisbury, and another (later known as ) was opened by the Salisbury and Yeovil Railway in 1859 on the West of England Main Line from London to Exeter. The arrival of the railways led to increased prosperity. The stations closed in 1955 and 1966 respectively; the nearest is now at . Military connections The headquarters of Land Forces (and predecessors) was at Erskine Barracks, northeast of Wilton, from 1949 to 2010. After the headquarters moved to Marlborough Lines near Andover the site was sold for housing. The site of the headquarters has recently been developed into accommodation for ex-service personnel. Governance The boundaries of the modern civil parish originate with the Borough of Wilton defined in 1885. The parish includes the villages of Bulbridge and Ditchampton. In 1894 Wilton absorbed the western part of the neighbouring parish of Fugglestone St Peter, the rest going into a new parish of Bemerton. The parish elects a town council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. Wilton is in the 'Wilton and Lower Wylye' electoral division. This division stretches north from Wilton to South Newton. The total division population taken at the 2011 census was 4,806. Parish church St Mary and St Nicholas' parish church The Grade I listed Church of England parish church of St Mary and St Nicholas was built as a replacement for St Mary's Church between 1841 and 1844 at the instigation of the Countess Alexina Sophia Gallot of Pembroke and her younger son, Baron Sidney Herbert of Lea, designed by the architect Thomas Henry Wyatt in the Romanesque style, with considerable Byzantine influences. For a small town, the church is enormous, representing the wealth of its benefactors. The most notable external feature of the church is the campanile. Many of the materials used in the church's construction were imported from Europe, including marble columns from Italy and 12th and 13th century stained glass from France.

Application-oriented networks are sometimes called \\"intelligent networks\\" or \\"content-based routing networks\\" and they are generally network technology that can use the content of a network packet or message to take some sort of action. Application- oriented networking was popularized by Cisco Systems in response to increasing use of XML messaging (combined with related standards such as XSLT, XPath and XQuery) to link miscellaneous applications, data sources and other computing assets. Most Application-Orientated Networks manipulate structured data based in a human-readable format like XML. Many of the operations required to mediate between applications, or to monitor their transactions, can be built into network devices that are optimized for the purpose. The rules and policies for performing these operations, also expressed in XML, are specified separately and downloaded as required. Cisco has adopted the AON acronym as the name of a family of products that function in this way. Routing decisions During the rise of the internet many routing decisions were made at layer 4 i.e. based on the TCP/IP address and/or the port number. Application-oriented networks work at layer 7 of the OSI stack and because they can examine the content of the message they can make routing decisions based on many different criteria including such things as the value of the purchase order or the ship date.

Due to the ad's popularity in Australia, the line entered the cultural vernacular as a catch phrase used to express a feeling of discontent. Background The television commercial from which the phrase originated was created by advertising agency Clemenger BBDO Melbourne for Sensis (the directories arm of Telstra), to promote the upcoming deadline for advertising in Australia's Yellow Pages. In the commercial, a businesswoman (Kennedy) has just discovered that one of her staff (Jan, played by Rhonda Doyle) has neglected to book an ad in the upcoming year's Yellow Pages. Realising they will have to wait another year, she calmly goes through some anger management techniques. When Jan runs away from work, Kennedy's unnamed character talks to herself and counts to ten before opening the window and shouting \\"Not happy, Jan!\\" towards the fleeing figure of Jan. The phrase was coined by Kennedy on the day of shooting. The ad ended up becoming lucrative for Australia's Yellow Pages with the words \\"Closing Soon. Call 132378\\" appearing on television from 2000 to 2003. Since the advertisement, \\"Not happy, Jan\\" has entered the Australian vernacular to express displeasure, particularly at a problem caused by another's negligence or incompetence. In the time immediately following the advertisement, it was usually said in a manner which mimicked the advertisement, but today is usually spoken with a casual, slightly stern tone. Women named Jan were particularly targeted. The phrase was co-opted by the unsuccessful 'Not happy, John!' campaign, opposing the re-election of Australian Prime Minister John Howard in the 2004 federal election. The title of the campaign also became the title of a book detailing the negative aspects of the Howard Government. Both \\"Not happy, Jan\\", and \\"Not happy, John\\", are common noms de plume used in short letters to newspaper editors. The commercial was featured on the Australian TV series 20 to One as one of the best Australian commercials of all time. On 6 October 2009, the catch phrase \\"Not happy, Jan!\\" was rated as best catch phrase in Australia on the ill-fated Australian TV series of 2009 The Spearman Experiment. The characters were relaunched in 2019, with the ad duplicated almost shot-for-shot, as promotion for the re-launch of Darrell Lea chocolate. Sensis sent cease-and-desist requests to Darrell Lea, their advertising agency Akkomplice and the television stations broadcasting the updated commercial.

The district population (year 2000 census) was 34,500. The population is dominated by Iban as well as Chinese especially the Fuzhou. Etymology History In 1853, James Brooke was able to take over Rajang River and its surrounding settlements from the Brunei Sultanate. A person from Xiamen named Limah Din (ÊûóÁªìÈ∫ü) was the first Chinese to arrive in Julau in 1929. He settled near the mouth of the Julau river and started acres of rubber plantations. He then used his home to start a trade business with the natives in Julau. In memory of his role in opening up Julau, a road is now named after him as Limah Din road.Yii, 2010. Page 270 The Chinese started business activities in 1936 at the mouth of the Julau river between Julau and Nanga Meluan. In the same year, the Brooke government set up a fort at a hill in Meluan in order to defend itself from the Iban attacks led by Penghulu Asun. In 1938, the Brooke government formally put Julau under the jurisdiction of Ng Meluan. The trading of rubber sheets and Engkabang fruits (Shorea macrophylla) between the Iban and the Chinese was the major economic activity in Julau.Yii, 2010. Page 270 During the Japanese occupation of Sarawak,there were some Iban people who took advantage of the power vacuum and went downriver and perform raiding activities. Therefore, the Chinese in Julau decided to cooperate with other more friendly Ibans to start patrolling and protecting the people. Besides, several Ibans decided to let the Chinese to open up their lands for the cultivation of rice, corn, and tobacco.Yii, 2010. Page 271-272 In 1953, the Bao Hua cinema (ÂÆùÂçéÊàèÈô¢Ôºâwas opened.

He was also an author of novels, drama, poetry and lyrics. Chorley was a prolific and important music and literary critic and music gossip columnist of the mid-nineteenth century and wrote extensively about music in London and in Europe. His opera libretti and works of fiction were far less successful. He is perhaps best remembered today for his lyrics to \\"The Long Day Closes\\", a part song set by Arthur Sullivan in 1868. Life and career Chorley was born in Blackley Hurst, near Billinge, Lancashire, England. Chorley was the youngest of four children of Quaker parents, John Chorley (1771‚Äì1816), an iron worker and lock maker, and Jane Chorley, n√©e Wilkinson (1779‚Äì1851). Chorley's father died, leaving his mother alone with young children. Jane Chorley moved her family to Liverpool to help take care of her half-brother, Dr Rutter, when he became ill. Chorley was educated by private tutors in Liverpool and then the school of the Royal Institution. His youth was shaped partly by spending time in the household of the wealthy and intellectual Mrs Benson Rathbone of Green Bank, and he became a close friend of her son Benson, who died in an accident in 1834.Bledsoe, Robert. \\"Chorley, Henry Fothergill (1808‚Äì1872)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 6 October 2008, =Journalism and non-fiction works= He began working in merchants' offices, hoping to become a musician, but his uncle discouraged that as an impractical ambition. However, Chorley soon took to musical and literary criticism. He began to write for the Athenaeum in 1830 and remained its music and literature critic until 1868. While there, he reviewed approximately 2,500 books and wrote reviews and musical gossip columns discussing composers and performers in Britain and on the European continent. In this position, he had much influence. He had strongly conservative views and was a persistent opponent of innovation, but was a lively chronicler of London life.See Preface by Robin Gordon-Powell, Archivist & Music Librarian of the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society, to the score of The Masque at Kenilworth, published by The Amber Ring in 2002 In 1850 and 1851, Chorley edited the Ladies' Companion, which covered fashion and domestic women's issues. In the Athenaeum and elsewhere, Chorley often criticised the music of Schumann and Wagner for what he called \\"decadence\\". In addition to criticism for journals, Chorley wrote voluminously on literature and art. His non-fiction books were widely read and included Music and Manners in France and Germany (1841), which includes a detailed description of contemporary opera in Paris and Felix Mendelssohn's career in Leipzig, Germany. He expanded the German section of this book and published it 1854 as Modern German Music.\\"Modern German Music ‚Äì Recollections and Criticisms\\", The Times review, 25 April 1854, p. 8, col. B His masterpiece was Thirty Years' Musical Recollections (1862), which covers, year-by-year, the opera seasons of European operas in London between 1830 and 1859. In the work, he blames the autocratic manager of Her Majesty's Theatre, Benjamin Lumley, for a decline in the quality of performances there. On the other hand, he praises the efforts of Giulia Grisi, Mario and Michael Costa, together with a group of journalists (including himself), for successfully creating the Royal Italian Opera at Covent Garden in 1847. He also wrote the well-received Memorials of Mrs. Hemans (1836), Handel Studies (1859), an annotated edition Mary Russell Mitford's letters (2 vols., 1872) and The National Music of the World (1882). =Fiction and playwriting= Chorley also wrote, with far less success, novels, stories, drama and verse, and various librettos. His works of fiction included Sketches of a Seaport Town (1834), a collection of stories, essays, and novellas related to Liverpool. The next year, he wrote Conti the Discarded. Neither of these achieved success. His plays, Old Love and New Fortune (1850) and Duchess Eleanour (1854), did not gain a following. He wrote two novels, Roccabella (1859) and A Prodigy: a Tale of Music (1866). His libretti included The Amber Witch for composer William Vincent Wallace, The May Queen ‚Äì A Pastoral (1858) for William Sterndale Bennett, and two for his friend Arthur Sullivan: The Sapphire Necklace and The Masque at Kenilworth.\\"Birmingham Musical Festival\\", The Times review, 12 September 1864, p. 10, col. A He published an English version of Meyerbeer's Dinorah, and wrote the words for several well-known songs, including Gounod's \\"Nazareth\\",Songs with English lyrics by Chorley Edward Loder's \\"The Brave Old Oak\\" and \\"The Three Ages\\", the English form of the Bach-Gounod \\"Ave Maria\\", Sullivan's \\"The Long Day Closes\\", and the hymn \\"God, the Omnipotent!\\". Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery, London Detail of monument Chorley wrote the English libretto for Gounod's Faust, for its first presentation in London in 1863 (at Her Majesty's Theatre). During rehearsals, it was found that the lines were unsingable. Both Sims Reeves and Charles Santley made strenuous and persistent complaints to Messrs. Chappell's, and new translations were made secretly, since no-one dared to tell Chorley. The first he knew of it was at the first performance. Chorley, as reviewer, waited to make his comment until the final announced performance, of which he wrote that it was \\"seriously imperilled by a singular translation\\". Unfortunately for him, the final performance in question had not taken place, so the Musical World was able to compliment him on his poetic imagination.C. Pearce, Sims Reeves ‚Äì Fifty Years of Music in England (Stanley Paul, London 1924), pp. 241‚Äì42. Nevertheless, Chorley's translations of several songs from Faust were published and widely performed, such as \\"The Flower Song\\", \\"When All Was Young\\" and \\"Glory and Love\\".Translations of Gounod songs by Chorley A similar Chorley effort, albeit of an obscure work, fared better: his translation of Mendelssohn's Die Heimkehr aus der Fremde, which Chorley rendered as \\"Son and Stranger,\\" for the work's London premiere in 1851Aldrich, Richard. \\"Of Music and Musicians: Hugo Wolff, His Songs and His Admirers‚ÄîMendelssohn's 'Return of the Roamer' and Its Origin,\\" The New York Times, 22 November 1903, accessed 23 November 2009 is still heard today in that work's rare revivals.Programme notes for Concert Opera Boston performance of 15 March 2009, accessed 23 November 2009 =Personality and last years= Chorley was considered eccentric and abrasive, but he was respected for his integrity and kindness. Chorley enthusiastically gave and attended dinner parties and was known as a big drinker. He cultivated friendships with Elizabeth Barrett and Mendelssohn, and later Charles Dickens, Arthur Sullivan and Charles Santley, among others. After the death of his brother, John Rutter Chorley (1806‚Äì1867), he inherited enough money to retire from the Athenaeum, although he continued to contribute articles for that paper and also for The Orchestra. In spite of his efforts to promote the music of Charles Gounod in England, the composer disliked Chorley intensely. When Gounod lived in England during the early 1870s, he wrote a satirical character piece for piano that was intended to be a parody of Chorley's personality. It greatly amused Gounod's English patron, Georgina Weldon, who described Chorley as having a \\"thin, sour, high-pitched sopranish voice\\" and moving like a \\"stuffed red-haired monkey.\\"Harding, pp. 179‚Äì80 Gounod intended to publish the piece with a dedication to Chorley, but the latter died before this was possible. Weldon then invented a new programme for the piece, which was re-titled Funeral March of a Marionette. It became popular as a concert piece,Hale, Philip. Programme, Boston Symphony Orchestra and in the 1950s, its opening phrases became well known as the theme music for the television program Alfred Hitchcock Presents.Frankel, Chris. \\"Jacopo Pontormo Tournament of Manners\\", #9, 1 July 2005 Chorley died at his home in London in 1872, at the age of 63, and is buried there in Brompton Cemetery.The Times, 21 February 1872, p. 5, col. E He left a very considerable estate of ¬£45,000. Fellow critic Charles Lewis Gruneisen wrote in the Athenaeum that Chorley's personality had impeded appreciation of his qualities.

Its name comes directly from a French piece of furniture, the chiffonier. The French name, which comes from the French for a rag-picker, suggests that it was originally intended as a receptacle for odds and ends which had no place elsewhere.Chiffonier, Oxford dictionaries British chiffonier In British usage, a chiffonier is similar to a sideboard, but differentiated by its smaller size and by the enclosure of the whole of the front by doors. It was one of the many curious developments of the mixed taste, at once cumbrous and bizarre, which prevailed in furniture during the Empire period in England. The earliest chiffoniers date from that time; they are usually of rosewood ‚Äì the favorite timber of that moment; their furniture (the technical name for knobs, handles, and escutcheons) was most commonly of brass, and there was very often a raised shelf with a pierced brass gallery at the back. The doors were well panelled and often edged with brass-beading, while the feet were pads or claws, or, in the choicer examples, sphinxes in gilded bronze. American chiffonier In North America, a chiffonier is quite different. There it refers to a tall, narrow and elegant chest of drawers, frequently with a mirror attached on top. It is also one half of the American portmanteau piece of furniture called a chifforobe. In media * A chiffonier is mentioned in chapters 4 and 18 in Gene Stratton- Porter's last novel The Keeper of the Bees (1925) * It appears five times (chapter 2: once, chapter 3: three times, chapter 13: once) in the novel The Catcher in the Rye by J.

The single, as recorded by Patti Page, became a gold record, having sold over a million copies. Having been hailed by \\"Cape Codders\\" as the \\"unofficial Cape Cod Anthem, if ever there was one\\", the song has been credited with \\"putting the Cape on the map\\" and helping to establish Cape Cod as a major tourist destination. Background The song extols the virtues of Cape Cod as a leisure destination with each verse ending with the line \\"You're sure to fall in love with old Cape Cod.\\" The nucleus of the song was a poem written by Boston-area housewife Claire Rothrock, for whom Cape Cod was a favorite vacation spot. \\"Old Cape Cod\\" and its derivatives would be Rothrock's sole evident songwriting credit. She brought her poem to Ace Studios, a Boston recording studio owned by Milton Yakus. The demo for \\"Old Cape Cod\\" was recorded at Ace, after Yakus adapted Rothrock's poem into the song's lyrics, and Yakus' associate Allan Jeffrey put it to music.The Hour September 22, 1983, p. 29 Patti Page version =Recording and impact= Patti Page had previously had a hit with a Milton Yakus composition, \\"Go on with the Wedding\\", in 1956. However, according to Page, Claire Rothrock herself brought \\"Old Cape Cod\\" to her, approaching Page at a Boston nightclub where the singer was performing. Page says of the song: \\"I just fell in love with it\\", and recorded \\"Old Cape Cod\\" during a day-trip to New York City, enabling her return to Boston in time for that evening's nightclub performance. As \\"Wondering\\" had already been set to be Page's next release, \\"Old Cape Cod\\" was recorded with the intent of serving as \\"Wondering\\"'s B-side. The \\"Wondering\\"/\\"Old Cape Cod\\" single was released by Mercury Records on April 23, 1957, as catalog number 71101. Both tracks debuted on the Billboard magazine charts for the week ending June 3, and \\"Old Cape Cod\\" quickly became the dominant track, peaking at number three on Billboard's Most Played by Jockeys chart, number eight on the Best Sellers In Stores chart, and number seven on The Top 100 composite chart for 1957. \\"Old Cape Cod\\" spent 18 weeks on the Cash Box magazine Best Selling Singles list, peaking at number eight and holding that same slot for three consecutive weeks. Additionally, \\"Old Cape Cod\\" was a hit in Australia, peaking at number 14. =Legacy= Page had never visited Cape Cod until after the song was released and had become a hit. She later recalled her first visit to the Cape, saying: Her last visit to Cape Cod was in February 2010, in which she attended a ceremony held in her honor at the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce, at which Massachusetts State Senator Robert O'Leary remarked: Symbolizing Page's \\"contributions in the promotion of Cape Cod through the years and with her music\\", the ceremony culminated with the Senator's dedication and unveiling of a new street sign: the road leading to the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce was thus renamed \\"Patti Page Way\\". Following Page's death on January 1, 2013, the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce credited the song's success with helping to establish Cape Cod as a major tourist destination: The song was referenced by Bruce Johnston in the lyrics of \\"Disney Girls\\", his nostalgic song about growing up in the 1950s: \\"Patti Page and summer days on old Cape Cod\\". Other versions \\"Old Cape Cod\\" was the subject of a 1990 lawsuit subsequent to a sound-alike version of the Patti Page hit being featured in a 1989 commercial for American Savings Bank. Page sued the advertising agency responsible for the commercial alleging that the commercial implied that Page herself endorsed American Savings Bank. Bing Crosby performed \\"Old Cape Cod\\" on his CBS Radio program in 1957, the recording of which was released after his death. Also in 1957, Michael Holliday covered it for the UK market. His version, which featured the Norrie Paramor Orchestra, failed to chart. The Norman Petty Trio also recorded \\"Old Cape Cod\\" in 1957, which version was originally featured on the Top 12 Vol 4 multi-artist compilation album and subsequently on Songs of New England a 1962 multi-artist compilation album. In 1960 Susan Barrett recorded \\"Old Cape Cod\\" for her A Little Travelin' Music album: the track would be included on the 1994 multi-artist compilation Capitol Sings Coast to Coast. Also in 1960 instrumentalist Billy Vaughn included \\"Old Cape Cod\\" on his album Theme from 'The Sundowners' whose title track in its single release ‚Äì which reached #51 as \\"The Sundowners\\" ‚Äì featured \\"Old Cape Cod\\" as its B-side. Jerry Vale had a 1963 single release of \\"Old Cape Cod\\" which bubbled under the Hot 100 with a #118 peak that summer; it was subsequently included on his 1964 album Have You Looked Into Your Heart. Also in 1963 Bobby Rydell remade \\"Old Cape Cod\\" for his Wild (Wood) Days album. In 1965 the Four Freshmen recorded a remake of \\"Old Cape Cod\\" to serve as B-side for the group's recording of the theme for the film Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines. Neither side became a hit, but \\"Old Cape Cod\\" did reach #33 on the Easy Listening chart. Also in 1965 recordings of \\"Old Cape Cod\\" were made by Robert Goulet for his album Summer Sounds and by Jane Morgan for her album In My Style, with Morgan's recording being issued as a single. Tennessee Ernie Ford recorded \\"Old Cape Cod\\" for his 1968 album release, Tennessee Ernie Ford's World of Pop and Country Hits. That same year, Dottie West recorded \\"Old Cape Cod\\" for her album Feminine Fancy, which mostly consisted of remakes of signature songs of well-known female singers, and also featured West's take on Patti Page's career record \\"Tennessee Waltz\\". Bette Midler recorded \\"Old Cape Cod\\" for release on her 1972 debut album The Divine Miss M although the track ‚Äì produced by Midler with Joel Dorn ‚Äì was debuted in 1976 on Songs for the New DepressionMark Bego Bette Midler: Still Divine Cooper Square Press (NYC) p.59 from which it was issued as a single with a #36 peak on the Adult Contemporary Charts. Anne Murray remade \\"Old Cape Cod\\" for Croonin' a 1993 album consisting of hit songs from the 1950s. An instrumental version of \\"Old Cape Cod\\" was featured on the 1998 album Matinee Idylls recorded by Dean Cassell and Milt Reder of Super Genius under the name Four Piece Suit. Mary Duff recorded \\"Old Cape Cod\\" for her 2006 album release Time After Time, the song being the first title in a \\"Patti Page medley\\" which subsequently features \\"With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming\\" and \\"Allegheny Moon\\". In 2007 the Puppini Sisters recorded \\"Old Cape Cod\\" for their album The Rise & Fall Of Ruby Woo. Other artists who have recorded \\"Old Cape Cod\\" include Beegie Adair, Thumbs Carllile, Wild Bill Davison, Don Lanphere, John Prine, Jimmie Rodgers and a 2008 mid-tempo-version by \\"Buffalo Crooner\\" Mark Weber. A Danish rendering of \\"Old Cape Cod\\" entitled \\"Der er bedst hos dig\\" was recorded by Ivan Meldgaard & the Four Jacks (da) in 1958. In 1967 Shirley Th√©roux (fr) recorded \\"Old Cape Cod\\" with French lyrics for her self-titled album, with the track also serving as B-side of her single \\"Un homme est dans ma vie\\". A sample of Patti Page's recording formed the basis of Groove Armada's 1997 UK hit \\"At the River\\". The lines \\"If you're fond of sand dunes and salty air / Quaint little villages here and there,\\" sung in Page's multi-tracked close-harmony, are repeated over and over, with the addition of synthesizer bass, slowed-down drums and a bluesy trombone solo to produce a chill-out track. American Idol finalist and Cape Cod native Siobhan Magnus covered the song and released it as a single in February 2013, honoring Patti Page who died earlier in the year. She released it on a limited edition vinyl 45 rpm single with a B side of her own: \\"Pure Inspiration\\", a song about bullying. 50% of the sales of that single went to benefit the Cape & Islands United Way, to set up a fund to support anti-bullying activities in schools on Cape Cod. Soundtrack appearances \\"Old Cape Cod\\" was featured in the 1990 film Die Hard 2, playing on a phonograph record in a character's airport basement apartment. The song plays on the radio in the Donna Deitch film Desert Hearts (1985) when the main character, played by Helen Shaver, moves to a new apartment in Reno, Nevada in the late 1950s. In 2006, the song appeared in the Ridley Scott movie A Good Year, starring Russell Crowe and Marion Cotillard. On August 8, 2010, the song appeared on AMC's Mad Men, Season 4, Episode 3: 'The Good News'.

He played in four Tests and fourteen ODIs for England. Maynard was a batsman (and, later in his career, wicketkeeper) known for his aggressive and dashing strokeplay. His first-class career with Glamorgan, saw him achieve a batting average of 42.53, take 372 catches and make seven stumpings with the gloves, earned him several caps for England, but he was never able to translate his county form into Test success. He was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1998. He was the second batsman for Glamorgan to score a century on debut in a first-class match. Life and career Born in Oldham, Lancashire, Maynard was brought up on the island of Anglesey in North Wales where he first joined Glamorgan. His career started in fine fashion when he hit a century on his debut in 1985, hitting three consecutive sixes to reach the 100 and he became the youngest-ever player to score 1,000 runs for the country in 1986. The 54 centuries he scored for Glamorgan during his playing career is also a record - the most any player has scored for the club. These displays of skill did not go unnoticed by the England selectors and he earned a call-up against the West Indies at the Oval in 1988. He was picked again in 1989 but then ran foul of the cricketing authorities by agreeing to go with Mike Gatting, on the controversial rebel tour of South Africa when that country had been banned from international sport because of its policy of apartheid. He later justified his decision by saying that he was desperate for a taste of international cricket having just been dropped from the England team. Nevertheless, his conduct led to a three-year Test ban, but he was eventually granted a recall for the Ashes series in 1993 after he had hit a century for Glamorgan against the Australians, but he failed to make much of an impact with the bat. Back in domestic cricket, Maynard captained Glamorgan for five seasons between 1995 and 2000. His achievement as captain included leading them to victory in the County Championship in 1997, and their first appearance since 1977 in a cup final at Lord's in 2000. That same year he earned one final recall to the England team, but only managed scores of 3 and 0 and it proved to be his last international appearance as a player. In September 2004, he was appointed as assistant coach to the England cricket team, and announced his retirement as a player shortly after, feeling he no longer enjoyed batting. In his short spell as an international coach, he caused some controversy. His appointment was criticised by former England captain Mike Atherton, who felt that the job should not have gone to someone who had been on the rebel tour of South Africa. His attitude came under fire from former coach Keith Fletcher, who accused him of being too fond of drinking and partying, to be a role model for young international cricketers. He hit back at Fletcher, criticising his management skills. Maynard continued to coach the England side and at one point drafted in professional lyricists to help him compose an England team song. After Duncan Fletcher's resignation following the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Maynard was replaced as England assistant coach in May 2007 by Andy Flower. In an interview following the announcement, Maynard said he had been offered a role with the Indian cricket academy. He previously coached the Nashua Titans, one of the six South African domestic cricket franchises. He has enjoyed an extremely successful first season, winning the domestic four day competition (Supersport Series) as well as the domestic T20 competition (MiWay T20 Challenge). At the end of the 2014 season, following the departure of David Nosworthy, Maynard was appointed the Director of Cricket at Somerset County Cricket Club. After three seasons at the club Maynard left his role as coach of Somerset after the end of the 2017 season. He was awarded the MBE in the 2019 New Year Honours. His son Tom was found dead on 18 June 2012. Contemporary usage Maynard was mentioned in the Manic Street Preachers' \\"Mr. Carbohydrate\\", the B-side of A Design for Life, with the lyric, \\"Have you heard of Matthew Maynard/He's my favourite cricketer/I would rather watch him play than pick up my guitar\\".

The band was also formative in creating the Good Time Jazz label under fellow aficionado Lester Koenig, who managed all the band's releases from 1940's \\"The Firehouse Five Plus Two Story, Volume 1\\" to 1970's \\"Live at Earthquake McGoon's\\". Walt Disney was approving of the band, letting them play at the company's Christmas parties, at Disneyland, and other social functions, on the single condition that they never fully leave their jobs at the studio.
