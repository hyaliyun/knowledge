It was endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. It is one of a number of unusual flightless flies native to the islands. It is not known to be arboreal, most specimens have been found in leaf litter. It is believed that this species, and other species from the same genus, may well be extinct. They were described as being locally abundant when collected in 1907 on Tantalus Peak, but not found in the 1980s. One reason for their demise is believed to be due to introduced predatory ants of the genus Pheidole, but other factors, including loss of habitat, may also be involved. The species was originally described and placed in the genus Emperoptera by Percy H. Grimshaw in 1902. It was moved to the genus Campsicnemus by Hardy & Kohn in 1964. However, in 1997, Neal Evenhuis reinstated it to the genus Emperoptera. In 2010, Evenhuis moved the species back to the genus Campsicnemus, after having shown evidence to support the synonymy of Emperoptera with Campsicnemus.

In Britain it was only recorded three times in the twenty years up to 1993 and was considered extinct there. But in 1994 it was found in a couple of places near Dartmoor. Carabus intricatus are nocturnal carnivores that are mainly active in the spring and early summer. Tests have shown they prefer slugs from the genus Limax, especially Limax marginatus. They were also found to have a taste for liver, dog food, and crabsticks. In the wild, the adults are found under bark on dead wood, and under rocks. It does not require ground vegetation, and likes damp, rotten, moss-covered wood. The beetles seem to be active throughout the year and a fully-grown larva has been found in summer. This specimen also ate slugs prior to pupating, and emerged as an adult some three weeks later. It is thought that it may take two years to complete its life cycle. The adults are very long-lived.

It may also occur in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and the Philippines, but confirmed records are lacking. Despite their name, horseshoe crabs are more closely related to spiders and scorpions (all are in the subphylum Chelicerata) than to crabs. Recent phylogenetic analysis suggests that horseshoe crabs may themselves be arachnids. The mangrove horseshoe crab is the only species in the genus Carcinoscorpius. There are four extant (living) species of horseshoe crab. The biology, ecology and breeding patterns of C. rotundicauda and the two other Asian horseshoe crab species, Tachypleus gigas and Tachypleus tridentatus, have not been as well documented as those of the North American species Limulus polyphemus. All four extant species of horseshoe crabs are anatomically very similar, but C. rotundicauda is considerably smaller than the others and the only species where the cross section of the tail (telson) is rounded instead of essentially triangular.  Evolutionary history  Horseshoe crabs are commonly known by biologists around the world as a living fossil because they have remained practically unchanged in terms of shape and size for millions of years. Although their physiology has changed over the years, their typical three piece exoskeleton, consisting of a prosoma, opisthosoma, and telson, has remained since the mid-Paleozoic era. Fossils of horseshoe crabs that have been dated to over look almost identical to those species that are still alive today. The long existence of this body plan suggests its success. It is estimated that the American species of horseshoe crab diverged from the three Indo-Pacific species approximately .  Anatomy  Mangrove horseshoe crab in Bako National Park, Malaysia The basic body plan of a horseshoe crab consists of three parts: the prosoma, the opisthosoma and the tail (telson). The prosoma is the large, dome-shaped frontal part at the carapace. The smaller rear carapace with spines on the edge is the opisthosoma. The rear extension that looks like a spike is the telson, which is commonly described as the tail. Uniquely among the horseshoe crabs, the cross section of the tail is rounded. It is essentially triangular in the other species. The tail is used to turn itself right side up when overturned. The mangrove horseshoe crab is the smallest of the four living species of horseshoe crabs. Like the other species, females grow larger than males. On average in Peninsular Malaysia, females are about long, including a tail that is about , and their carapace (prosoma) is about wide. In comparison, the average for males is about long, including a tail that is about , and their carapace is about wide. There are significant geographic variations in the size, but this does not follow a clear north‚Äìsouth or east‚Äìwest pattern. Those from West Bengal in India average somewhat smaller than those from Peninsular Malaysia, with a carapace width of about and in females and males respectively. Elsewhere it averages even smaller, with the smallest reported from the Balikpapan and Belawan regions in Indonesia where the carapace width of females is about and in males . The largest females of the species may reach up to in length, including the tail. Uncommon for chelicerates, horseshoe crabs have two compound eyes. The main function of these compound eyes is to find a mate. In addition, they have two median eyes, two rudimentary lateral eyes, and an endoparietal eye on their carapace and two ventral eyes located on the underside by the mouth. Scientists believe the two ventral eyes aid in the orientation of the horseshoe crab when swimming. Each individual has six pairs of appendages. The first pair, the chelicerae, are relatively small and placed in front of the mouth. They are used to place food in it. The remaining five pairs of legs are placed on either side of the mouth and are used for walking/pushing. These are the pedipalps (first pair) and the pusher legs (remaining four pairs). Most of the appendages have straight, scissor-like claws, but in males the first and second pair of walking legs have strongly hooked \\"scissors\\", which are used for grasping the female during mating. Located behind their legs are book gills. These gills are used for propulsion to swim and to exchange respiratory gases.  Distribution and habitat  This species occurs only in Asia around the Indo-West Pacific region where the climate is tropical or subtropical. These horseshoe crabs can be found to exist throughout the Southeast Asia region in shallow waters with soft, sandy bottoms or extensive mud flats. The mangrove horseshoe crab is benthopelagic, spending most of its life close to or at the bottom of a body of their brackish, swampy water habitat, such as mangroves. This is the habitat for which it gains its common name: mangrove horseshoe crab. Scientists have studied the distribution of mangrove horseshoe crabs in Hong Kong specifically. The researchers noted their abundance on the beaches of Hong Kong before the sharp decline in population over the past ten years. In the study, they found an uneven distribution of the horseshoe crabs throughout Hong Kong, with a greater abundance found in the western waters. They predict this unevenness is due to the estuarine hydrography in the western waters, influenced by the Pearl River. They also found that T. tridentatus can coexist in the same habitat as the mangrove horseshoe crab.  Diet  Mangrove horseshoe crabs are selective benthic feeders, feeding mainly on insect larvae, small fish, oligochaetes, small crabs and thin-shelled bivalves. Lacking jaws, it grinds up the food with bristles on its legs and places it in its mouth using its chelicerae. The ingested food then enters the cuticle- lined oesophagus and then the proventriculus. The proventriculus is made up of a 'crop' and a 'gizzard'. The crop can expand to fit the ingested food, while the gizzard grinds the food into a 'pulp'. Studies have found that mangrove horseshoe crabs have a strong preference for insect larvae over the other organisms on which it also feeds.  Mating biology  In the spring, horseshoe crabs migrate from the deeper water to the shallow, muddy areas. Nesting usually follows the cycle of the high tide of the full and new moons. During the mating period, the males will follow and cling to the backs of their potential mates using modified prosomal appendages for long periods of time before the egg-laying has occurred. Horseshoe crab species with low spawning densities and 1:1 sex ratios, such as the mangrove horseshoe crab, are found to be monogamous. In addition, the female does not choose her mate. Males find their female mates with the use of visual and chemoreceptive signals. Once a mate is found, the female digs a hole and lays the eggs while the male externally fertilizes them. Once the eggs are laid, the male and female head back to the ocean, and the eggs develop on their own. Their eggs are large, and after a couple weeks, the eggs hatch into miniature versions of the adults. Mangrove horseshoe crabs in Singapore breed from August to April. Juveniles grow about 33% bigger each time they moult, and it takes the juveniles about five moults to grow from to adult size.  Use by humans  Chonburi, Thailand Thousands of the horseshoe crabs are caught by local fishermen. While the crabs have very little flesh, their roe is prized as a delicacy, in Thailand most commonly served as a salad called yam khai maeng da (‡∏¢‡∏≥‡πÑ‡∏Ç‡πà‡πÅ‡∏°‡∏á‡∏î‡∏≤). There have occasionally been cases of food poisonings or even deaths after consuming the crabs as they were misidentified as another horseshoe crab species, Tachypleus gigas. Unlike larger T. gigas, C. rotundicauda is known to often contain lethal tetradotoxin. In addition, horseshoe crabs are prized for their blue blood, as it is widely used in biomedical sciences for the development of drugs for diseases like mental exhaustion and gastroenteritis. The blood contains a chemical called Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) that can be used to detect pathogens and their endotoxins.

This project was originated by Vox Novus, of which called for, collected, selected, and presented 15 varied one-minute acoustic miniatures. The 15 selections are composed for a specific artist or chamber ensemble and then debuted on the Composer's Voice Concert Series.

While a constraint, the one-minute miniature format allows for the composer to write a short composition with greater ease than a longer work. Fifteen Minutes of Fame encourages experimentation and opportunities to write for instrumentation that are not commonly available. With the significantly larger number of works selected being 15 and the frequency Fifteen Minutes of Fame is produced, it becomes a huge resource for composers to have their work played and receive greater exposure. The one- minute miniatures for Fifteen-Minutes-of-Fame are written by composers from all over the globe.Miniature2011: un intero anno di musica con Francesco Di Fiore 04/01/2012 Fifteen Minutes of Fame has presented more than 100 composers including Dennis Bathory-Kitsz, Joshua Barlage, John Bilotta, Scott Brickman, Carson Cooman, Salim Dada, Emma Lou Diemer, Bobby DeLisle,Graduate Composition student premiers work at Vox Novus concert Matthew Van Dongen,Wharton Institute for the Performing Arts Presents Salon Series By WHARTON INSTITUTE February 11, 2018 at 2:49 PM Moritz Eggert, Francesco Di Fiore,http://www.julienews.it/notizia/cultura-e-tempo-libero/francesco-di- fiore-in-piano-solo-alla-fondazione-borsieri-di-lecco/101354_cultura-e-tempo- libero_7.html Arthur Gottschalk, Emma Liddel, David Morneau, Serban Nichifor, James Soe Nyun, Michael Mikulka,http://www.utclutch.org/node/815 Nova Pon, Nolan Stolz, Edward Strauman,https://www.chc.edu/news-center/press/music- composition-edward-strauman-phd-selected-international-competition and David Wolfson.http://davidwolfsonmusic.net/blog/?p=378 Circuit Bridges Circuit Bridges is an electro-acoustic concert series designed to present and promote the electro-acoustic music.

It has an armed wing, the Kachin Independence Army, which operates in Kachin and Shan State.  History  In 1960, two Kachin dissidents and ex-soldiers of the Burma Army, Lamung Tu Jai and Lama La Ring, contacted fellow dissident Zaw Seng and founded the Kachin Independence Organisation. Zaw Seng became the first leader of the KIO, Zaw Tu became the first deputy leader, and Lama La Ring became the first secretary. They provided the KIO with ammunition to form a 27-member private army. On 5 February 1960, the KIO's private army raided a bank, among other activities. When Burmese authorities began responding to the KIO's actions, many young Kachin dissidents went underground to join the KIO. A year later on 5 February 1961, the KIO's 100-strong private army was reorganised into the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and became the KIO's armed wing, with Zaw Seng as commander in chief. Following the 1962 Burmese coup d'√©tat, the KIO expanded its armed wing with new recruits, who dissented against the new military junta under General Ne Win. Soldiers from Myanmar's Tatmadaw (armed forces) fought KIA insurgents for over 33 years until a ceasefire was brokered between the two opposing sides in 1994. The ceasefire lasted for 17 years until June 2011, when the Tatmadaw resumed operations against the KIA. Aside from its major towns and railway corridor, KIO/A-controlled areas in Kachin State remained virtually independent and isolated from the rest of Myanmar from the mid-1960s through 1994, with an economy based on cross-border jade trade with China and narcotics trafficking. In 2005, the KIO moved its headquarters from Pajau to Laiza, and established a military academy and training school.  Services  The KIO operate an education system in areas under their control, running over 200 schools https://www.mmtimes.com/special-features/165-back-to- school-2013/6754-education-takes-a-hit-in-kachin-state.html.  Funding  The KIO funds most of its armed wing's activities through the cross-border trade with China of jade, timber and gold. Money is also raised through KIA-imposed taxes on locals.

His style is that of the late Spanish baroque, pre-classical, and classical periods, with frequent reference to Guatemalan folk music idioms. Life From an early age, Castellanos trained as an apprentice under his uncle Manuel Jos√© de Quir√≥s, chapelmaster of the cathedral of Santiago de Guatemala. In 1740, the young Rafael signed a composition for voice and basso continuo, on the Latin text of the Second Lamentation of Jeremiah. This piece reflects his mastery of baroque writing and an unusual expressive talent. In 1745 he became a journeyman and was admitted as a member of the cathedral orchestra as first violin, sometimes also playing harp. During the 1750s he produced various of his own compositions for the matins services, along with those of his uncle. When Quir√≥s died in 1765, Castellanos was appointed his successor as chapel master, with the duties of conducting cathedral music during matins, vespers, and Mass, and of composing suitable music for different liturgical occasions. After the earthquake of 1773 life changed dramatically in the City of Santiago de Guatemala, which would shortly move to the site of present-day Guatemala City by order of King Charles III of Spain. After 1775 the city would be known as Antigua Guatemala. Castellanos remained loyal to the Archbishop, Pedro Cort√©s y Larraz, and only left with his musicians, the clergy, and the religious orders when they were forced to do so, arriving at the new site in November 1779. Despite the hardship of his new life, Castellanos kept up his work, composing four or five works every year. Among his pupils, several became able composers, such as Manuel Silvestre Pellegeros and Pedro Nolasco Estrada Aristondo, his eventual successor as maestro de capilla. External links * Works One hundred seventy-six of his works are extant and have been catalogued. Some of them have been transcribed into modern score for performance and recording. All of his output is vocal, with villancicos and cantatas for different feasts of the Catholic liturgical calendar, as well as sacred works on Latin texts. Several of his compositions are available on CD, performed by Cristina Altamira and the Millennium Ensemble.

It was a conventional design for the era featuring a two-bay equal-span unstaggered biplane wing cellule. The prototype was exhibited at the 1922 Salon de l'A√©ronautique and evaluated the following year by the A√©ronautique Maritime. The type's favourable performance led to an order of 22 machines for the French military and an export order of seven for Yugoslavia and four for Poland. A single civil example was produced as the CAMS 30T with two extra passenger seats. In August 1924, Ernest Burri used this machine to break the world air speed record for a passenger-carrying seaplane.

It is known by the common names yellowface and inspector. It is native to central Africa, where it has a widespread distribution. This dragonfly lives in swampy habitats. It is affected by the drainage and reclamation of swamps for agriculture, but it is not considered to be threatened. Description Chalcostephia flavifrons is a fairly small species of dragonfly, with a hind-wing length of . The mature adult male is a bluish-grey colour and pruinose (covered with a dusting of wax particles on top of the cuticle). The adult female and the newly emerged male are dark with bold yellow banding. Both males and females can be distinguished from other similar species by their yellow face contrasting with the flattened, metallic green frons (front of the head). The membranous, veined wings are transparent except for the pterostigmata, a small group of thickened cells at the leading edge of the wing-tips, which have pale centres and dark edges. Distribution and habitat This species has a widespread distribution over tropical and sub-tropical, sub-Saharan Africa. Its range includes Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinee-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Republic of Guinea, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, South Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

It is only known from its type locality ‚Äì the Upper Tully River catchment in the Cardwell Range of north-eastern Queensland ‚Äì and is listed as data deficient on the IUCN Red List. It was discovered in a rainforest catchment in a highland of northeastern Queensland during a Queensland Museum expedition to the upper Tully River area in November 1992. It is one of the smallest species in the genus. No species of Cherax has been considered endemic to wet upland or highland areas before it was discovered; most previous records were from elevations less than 400 meters. It also has several morphological features unique to the genus, and does not appear closely related to any extant species, suggesting a long period of geographic isolation.  Anatomy of male holotype = Cephalothorax  The carapace (hard upper shell) is punctuated and slender, with a width of 0.5 to 0.6 mm and a depth of 0.5 to 0.6 mm. The cephalon (the head) has a few tubercles ventrally. The branchiostegites are uninflated, with a few tubercles along the ventral cervical groove. The rostrum (spinelike anterior median prolongation of the carapace) is slender and triangular, with a length of 1.0 to 1.6 mm. It is dorsally flattened and punctuated along the inner margins of the lateral carinae (narrow, longitudinal ridge extending along each side of carapace) and is smooth medially and bristly distally near the acumen (spine-like anterior median prolongation of the carapace). The lateral carinae are moderately developed, commencing at the base of the rostrum, terminating at the acumen, without tubercles or spines. The ventrolateral margins are bristly. The acumen is blunt and upturned. The postorbital carinae are almost obsolete, unarmed anteriorly, excavated with well-separated punctations, commencing close to orbital margin of the carapace, medially curved anteriorly, and diverging posteriorly. The cervical groove is bristly. The branchiocardiac grooves are obsolete. Its eyes are large, globular, and well-pigmented. The eyestalks are largely concealed by the rostrum. The scaphocerite (flattened plate or scale attached to the second joint of the antennae) length slightly exceeds the length of the rostrum, broadest at midlength. The lamina is broadly rounded at the middle, with the lateral margin terminating in a well-developed spine. The peduncles (stalks) of the antennae are bristly ventrally. The coxocerite (basal joint of antennae) is acute anteriorly. The basicerite (the second joint of antennae) has no lateral spine. The epistome (plate in front of the mouth) is strongly concave at the middle and bristly anteriorly with distinct tubercles laterally. The mouthparts do not have unique features for the genus. The branchial formula is typical for the genus with the posterior arthrobranch (gill attached to the articular membrane between the body and the basal joint of a leg) above P4 reduced. Pleurocoxal (of the first segment of the leg) lappets are well-developed and are fringed with long, plumose setae (hair-like projections). The lappet between P4 and P5 is unusually thin and circular, with very long plumose setae. The sternal keel (long ridge that runs lengthwise along the top of the head) is sharp posteriorly, more rounded anteriorly, and bristly laterally.  Chelipeds  The first chelipeds are large. The chela (claw) length exceeds the carapace length. The distal merus (fourth limb segment distally from body) reaches the end of the scaphocerite. The outer margin of the chela is moderately convex. The fingers slightly gape and the opposing edges are dense with bristles ventrally as bristles on the pollex (movable joint of forceps) continue onto the manus (immovable finger and palm). It bears rounded teeth, with one tooth large and prominent on the dactylus (seventh and terminal segment of their thoracic appendages) at midlength, and a similar slightly smaller tooth on the pollex. The pollex is broad basally, evenly tapering. The dactylus is broadest at midlength and equal to the manus in length. The manus is moderately broad and its breadth is equal to its length. The dorsum is slightly convex longitudinally, strongly convex laterally, with teeth in the middle continuing onto the distal half. The carpus (third segment from the distal end of the leg) bears a large, broad, hook-shaped mesial spine (missing on left cheliped). The angle of the distoventral or ventromesial condyle (a heavily sclerotized projection of the mandible's dorsal surface) is not produced into a spine or tubercle. A few tubercles are seen posteromesially. The distomesial angle is smooth. The distodorsal condyle is strongly developed and is enlarged laterally to form a broad, sclerotinous plate. The merus (the upper arm) is of typical shape. The dorsal carina has no obvious tubercles or spines. The ventral surface is sparsely bristly.  Color  The body is dark brown. The first chelipeds are dark brown distodorsally with reticulated pattern on the manus, orange at the fingertips, orange at proximal segments, and cream at the ventral manus and fingers. Second chelipeds and ambulatory legs are greenish-cream dorsally and light cream ventrally.  Biology  This crayfish species lives in fresh water, short phreatic burrows under rocks, or amongst leaf litter in shallow, open water (1 m). It lives on rocks/sand or clay substrates on the edge of notophyll vine forests. It has a close association with rainforest. It lives at 720‚Äì750 m altitude. The waters it inhabits have zero to moderate flow and high clarity. The species can tolerate water with a pH around 5.5, a hardness less than 10 ppm, a temperature between 18 and 20¬∞C, and levels of dissolved oxygen between 5.8 and 6.0 ppm. C. parvus is sympatric with E. yigara, Caridina zebra, and an undescribed Macrobrachium sp.  Distribution  This species is found in the upper Tully River and its tributary, O‚ÄôLeary Creek; above Koombooloomba Dam, at 720‚Äì750 m altitude; and the Cardwell Range.  Status  This species is probably secure. Although abundant at the type locality, more data are required on the distribution of the species and its relative abundance at other sites.  Etymology  Latin (adjective), meaning small.  Systematic position  Crayfish of the genus Cherax are distributed throughout the humid tropics of north Queensland. Although records of C. parvus lie within the broad geographical range of C. depressus, C. parvus does not appear closely related to that complex. The following unique features suggest a long period of geographic isolation: #The almost obsolete postorbital carinae commencing very close to the orbital carapace margin. #The distodorsal condyle on the campus of the first chelipeds is very strongly developed and enlarged laterally to form a broad, sclerotinous plate. #The pleurocoxal lappet between P4 and P5 is unusually thin, and fringed with very long, plumose setae. #The branchiostegites are uninflated in developed specimens. With regard to the last character, inflated branchiostegisites and narrow areolae are generally correlated with the enlargement of the branchial chambers and increased surface area of gills. This is most pronounced in fully grown adults of species living in poorly oxygenated habitats. The relatively small branchial chambers of C. parvus may reflect its preference for cool, well-oxygenated, rainforest streams. In contrast to the unarmed rostrum of C. parvus, all highland New Guinean species, except C. monticola, have two or more pairs of lateral processes (tubercles or spines) on the rostrum. C. parvus, however, has two well-defined uncalcified patches on the first cheliped of mature males and is clearly allied to the quadricarinatus species- group. ReferencesFurther reading * J.W.

At its heyday the club was renowned for discovering talented players who would go on to play at the highest level, for example five former players took part in the 2004 Olympics final. However, Viola was also plagued by financial problems, with the club declaring bankruptcy in three occasions (1997, 2009 and 2019), that later sent it out the Italian elite. In 2019 a phoenix club, called Viola Supporters Trust, wasformed by the fans of Viola Reggio Calabria. It currently plays in Serie C Silver Calabria, the fifth tier of the Italian pyramid. History The club was founded in 1966 as Cestistica Piero Viola by judge Peppino Viola in honour of his late brother Piero. It started playing in the Serie C that season, replacing AICS Reggio Calabria where Piero Viola had played at that level, finishing ninth. The club would establish itself in the Serie C (renamed Serie B from 1974-75) during the succeeding years. It would reach the professional second division Serie A2 in 1983. After a mid-table finish in its first season, Viola won the league in 1984-85 and earned a promotion to the Serie A. It was relegated after one season, returning in 1989 following a three-year stay in the Serie A2. The newly promoted side had its best ever season for its return to the elite, finishing the regular season in seventh place before losing in the playoff quarterfinals to Pallacanestro Varese, as Viola's Dan Caldwell finished as the league's top scorer. Carlo Recalcati took over the coaching reins the following season which ended in relegation. The club would bounce back by winning the Serie A2 in 1991-92. It would best its best finish with a sixth place in the 1992-93 Serie A, before a playoff quarterfinals series against Benetton Treviso ended with a disallowed on the buzzer shot that would have tied the game for Viola in the decisive 18 April game. The club made three other playoff appearances the next four seasons (quarterfinals in 1994 and eighth-finals in 1996 and 1997) with another of its players, Brian Oliver, leading the league in scoring during the 1995-96 season. The Cestistica Piero Viola organisation would be declared bankrupt in December 1997 (a bankruptcy later revoked due to irregularities), it was replaced in January 1998 by Basket Viola Reggio Calabria SPA and then by Nuovo Basket Viola Reggio '98 the same year. After a parenthesis in the Serie A2 in 1998-99, the club, counting a young Manu Gin√≥bili in its ranks, again reached the playoff quarterfinals though they were eliminated by Virtus Bologna. The next season saw Gin√≥bili leave but players such as Carlos Delfino and Leandro Palladino arrive to help Viola stave off relegation and reach the 2000‚Äì01 FIBA Koraƒá Cup Round of 16. After battling relegation again in 2002, Viola returned to the playoffs the following year, with a repeat of the past of they again lost in five games to Benetton Treviso. Nuovo Basket Viola struggled to raise funds prior to the 2004-05 season, with only a last ditch cash injection by the municipality keeping the club, sponsor-less until March 2005, financially afloat. The club would finish in the relegation places in 2005 but kept its top flight status after Scavolini Pesaro folded. It was relegated in 2006, where three successive coaches could not stop the club from moving down to the LegaDue (the renamed second division). Despite securing its LegaDue status on the court in 2007, Viola would see financial difficulties put an end to its professional activity over the summer, with the management unable to raise enough funds to keep the club running. Viola continued operating only through its youth sector, with the team playing in the Serie D. On 7 July 2009, a new organisation acquired the sporting rights of Basket Gragnano and was admitted into the Serie B Dilettanti. A change in ownership over the 2010 summer saw Giancesare Muscolino become president. The club would finish second during the regular season before losing in the promotion playoffs final to Orlandina Basket. The 2011-12 again saw the team stall in the promotion playoffs but it was admitted into the DNA anyway. The club then successfully fought relegation the following two seasons and with the second and third tier merging in 2015-16, play in the second division as of the 2015-16 season. Arena The PalaCalafiore At the beginning of the 1970s, the club transferred to the Scatolone arena, a small venue containing around 500 seats. With the club promoted to the Serie A2 in 1983, the Scatolone did not answer the league's requirements, a new arena - the Botteghelle - was built over fifty-seven days. In 1991 the PalaCalafiore (full name: Palasport Francesco Calafiore in dedication to a local sports journalist) was built; it is the biggest arena in Calabria and the seventh-largest in Italy, with more than 8,500 seats. Viola still plays in this arena (also known as the PalaPentimele, from the Pentimele neighbourhood it is situated in) as of the 2015-16 season.

Early life and career Papley grew up supporting South Melbourne and attended South Melbourne Technical School, the same school as his hero, the legendary Bob Skilton. Papley began playing football for the Melbourne Fourths, and was told by his coach that he was too small. He then went to play with Port Melbourne YMCA before his family moved to Moorabbin, and there he joined the local Moorabbin Football Club, which was competing in the Victorian Football Association (VFA). Despite standing only 179 centimetres, Papley quickly built a reputation as a full-forward and as one of the star players of the VFA. At the age of 23, he captained Moorabbin to the 1963 VFA premiership and kicked six goals in the Grand Final. He played 96 senior games over five seasons for Moorabbin. In February 1964, Papley was cleared to South Melbourne, a couple of months prior to the events which saw Moorabbin expelled from the VFA. He had signed a form with South before his parents relocated to Moorabbin, and much as he loved playing for Moorabbin, Papley was happy to have a boyhood dream come true. He played as a half forward and centreman during his time at South Melbourne, winning their 1966 best and fairest award and representing Victoria in interstate football over four seasons with South Melbourne/ But again Papley's football career would take an unexpected turn. Although Papley enjoyed football and was clearly talented enough to become a star, he also enjoyed playing cricket, and was captain-coach of Moorabbin Cricket Club in the Sub-District competition. Papley had made it clear to South Melbourne that he would continue playing as long as it did not interfere with his cricket commitments. In February before the start of the 1968 VFL season, while Papley was working in the chemical industry with clients in Williamstown, he got to know the president of the Williamstown Football Club. He told Papley that the club's coach had just retired and wondered if Papley would consider taking on the job. Papley told South about the offer and, because the club would not relent over the cricketing issue, he moved to Williamstown without a clearance and took up the job as captain-coach. Papley led the club to Grand Finals in his first three seasons, and winning the 1969 premiership in the VFA Second Division despite having suffered bruised ribs in a car accident in the previous week. He retired from playing after the 1970 season due to hamstring injuries, but remained as coach until 1972 ‚Äì although he did return to the field for a few games in 1972. Papley played 54 games for the Seagulls, and kicked 108 goals, and his contribution was recognized with selection in Williamstown's official 'Team of the Century' in 2003 as centreman. Papley captained the VFA representative team against Tasmania in one match in June 1968; it was the VFA's last representative match during Papley's career. After football After finishing at Williamstown, Papley moved with his family to Bunyip, where he has lived since. His grandson Thomas Papley was drafted to the Sydney Swans on 27 November through the rookie draft. Personal life Papley is married to Laraine. They have four children, Cathy, Vicki, David and Karen, 12 grandchildren and one great- granddaughter. Three of his grandsons have played in the AFL, Ben Ross ( and ), Michael Ross () and Tom Papley ().

She created the National Feminist Party and pressed for suffrage for women by creating a school to teach them political responsibility. She was the first Latin American woman to earn a doctorate in law. She served in the Constitutional Assembly which finally granted women emancipation in 1946 and was the first Panamanian woman named as a Juvenile Court judge. She assisted in drafting the Juvenile Code and founded the Chapala Juvenile Reformatory. Biography Clara Gonz√°lez Carrillo was born on 11 September 1898 in Remedios, Chiriqu√≠ Province, Republic of Panama to Spanish immigrants, David Gonz√°lez and Basilia Carrillo S√°nchez. As an infant, she lived with her family in Costa Rica, where they were exiled between 1900 and 1904. She earned a teaching degree from the Escuela Normal in 1918 and in 1919 enrolled in Escuela Nacional de Derecho (National School of Law). While she was in law school, she taught at the Escuela Manuel Jos√© Hurtado. In 1922, she became the first Panamanian woman to earn a Bachelor of Law, but was prohibited from practicing. Her graduate thesis, La Mujer ante el Derecho Paname√±o (Woman in Panamanian Law) was one of the first studies of the legal status of women and became the basis for a push to change the constitution. President Belisario Porras's administration received many requests to amend the constitution and finally did so in 1925, allowing Gonz√°lez to practice law. The need to organize a feminist movement that favored women's participation in politics led Gonz√°lez and women leaders like Sara Sotillo, Elida Campod√≥nico de Crespo, Rosa Navas and others to create the National Feminist Party in 1923, though it took until 1924 to gain legal organization status. One of the first things that the group did was organize the Escuela de Cultura Femenina (School of Feminine Culture) to counter claims that women could not participate because they knew nothing of politics. The school taught civics, history, politics and any other subjects that would enhance knowledge for women in professional and social spheres. Winning a scholarship in 1927, Gonz√°lez went to the US to attend New York University, earning a doctorate in law in 1929 and becoming the first Latin American woman with the distinction. She returned to Panama in 1930, began working as a professor at the National Institute teaching economics, political science and sociology, and attempted to revive the National Feminist Party. She taught at the Institute until 1937 and with the founding of the University of Panama, began teaching criminology, family law and juvenile justice. With the overthrow of president Arnulfo Arias in 1941, Gonz√°lez found a shift in the political climate. Between 1941 and 1945, she served as host of the Popular Culture Centers for Adults, in 1943 she married American civil engineer Charles A. Behringer, and on 30 December 1944 she founded the Uni√≥n Nacional de Mujeres (National Women's Party). She ran as a candidate with the Liberal Renewal Party and was elected as a deputy of the Constitutional Assembly of 1945. She served as the Vice-minister of Labor, Social Provisions, and Public Health between 1945 and 1946 and was instrumental in pushing the passage of the right to vote and equal political rights bill which became law in 1946. She became the first Panamanian woman named as a Juvenile Court judge in 1951 and helped establish the Juvenile Court guardianship policies, uniform procedures for dealing with juvenile delinquency, as well as founding the Chapala Juvenile Reformatory. She continued working for the juvenile court until 1964 when she took retirement at her husband's request and settled with him in West Covina, California. After his death in 1966, she returned to her homeland and except for a few travels to visit family remained in Panama. Clara Gonz√°lez died after complications of a hip surgery in Panama City on 11 February 1990.

Dodson, Foam Index Test, Concrete Admixtures, Structural Engineering Series, Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York, pp 140‚Äì143 (1990). Introduction AEA surfactants are added into concrete mixes to impart stable air microbubbles to give air void volumes between ~ 5%‚Äì10%. Besides increasing workability, adding the correct amount of AEA during concrete mixing improves its resistance to cracking during freeze and thaw cycles. Adding too much AEA during mixing decreases concrete strengths. Fly ash from pulverized coal combustion is a typical mineral admixture utilized in the production of concrete, where it partially replaces cement and improves concrete workability, pumping characteristics, hardness and resistance to alkali attack. However, cement and components of fly ash adsorb AEA‚Äôs to different extents, making it more difficult to routinely impart the correct amount of entrained air into concrete. The Foam Index Test was developed to measure capacities of AEA for cement-mineral admixtures during concrete mixing. The Foam Index Test is a laboratory titration procedure which determines the AEA absorption on fly ash or fly ash and cement mixtures. An AEA is titrated into a fly ash and cement suspension and the suspension is shaken. The added AEA leads to foam formation on top of the liquid surface, which initially behaves in an unstable manner. At the endpoint of the test, the AEA absorption sites are ‚Äúsaturated‚Äù and the AEA contributes to foam formation on the top of the mixture. The amount of AEA required to obtain stable foam depends on fly ash quality, fly ash-cement interactions, and characteristics of the AEA. Some fly ashes, typically those with high unburned carbon contents,I. Kulaots, A. Hsu, R.H. Hurt and E.M. Suuberg, Adsorption of surfactants on unburned carbon in fly ash and development of a standardized foam index test, Cement & Concrete Research 33 (2003) 2091.Y-M. Gao, H-S. Shim, R.H. Hurt and R.M. Suuberg, Effects of carbon on air entrainment in fly ash concrete: the role of soot and carbon black, Energy & Fuels 11 (1997) 457.I. K√ºlaots, R.H. Hurt and E.M. Suuberg, Size distribution of unburned carbon in coal fly ash and its implications, Fuel 83 (2004) 223. tend to adsorb high amounts of AEA, i.e. more AEA is needed to obtain stable foam. Procedure of foam index test Adding diluted AEA one drop at a time is the most accurate way to measure the foam index, especially when trying to develop your ability to duplicate the test. You may want to add five drops at a time at first with a high dosage rate material until you get near the ‚ÄúIndex‚Äù level. The traditional way to identify foam index values is by visual observation. ‚Ä¢ A ‚ÄúStable Foam‚Äù is achieved when no open areas of liquid show for at least 30‚Äì45 seconds on the surface of the foam. Bubbles break rapidly at AEA levels below the ‚ÄúIndex‚Äù level. Bubbles will still break for several increments above the ‚ÄúIndex‚Äù level as well ‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt continue adding AEA trying to stop the breaking bubbles. This point is difficult to judge at first. Run the same material several times in a row to help calibrate your ‚Äúeye.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ Although the Foam Index test is not designed to determine the actual AEA dosage amounts needed for concrete, it is possible to standardize proceduresAutomated foam index test an automated instrument instead of manual test. to determine AEA dosage amounts. It is also a good test to determine if specific materials will require more or less AEA relative to others. If the test is performed on the same materials and a plot of the results charted against required AEA dosages, correlations are possible between AEA dosage requirements and Foam Index test results. Image:Foamindex0.jpgBubbles do not cover entire surface Image:Foamindex1.jpgBubbles cover entire surface Automated Foam Index Test (AFIT) The AFIT instrument quantifies the dynamic foaming properties of air entraining agents, surfactants and foaming materials. It makes these measurements without intrusion of a probe or device into a working environment. Appropriate foam stabilities are necessary for proper performance of the materials onto/into which AEA‚Äôs or surfactants are applied.

He played college football at the University of Michigan where he set many of the school's receiving records and became an 2001 College Football All-American. In 2001, he led the Big Ten Conference in receptions. In 2004, Braylon Edwards surpassed most of his school records. In high school, Walker set several important New York State Public High School Athletic Association (NYSPHSAA) football records for receptions and reception yardage. All of these records have since been broken. Walker is remembered for a pair of spectacular one-handed catches during the 2001 NCAA Division I-A football season. He was selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with the 86th overall pick in the third round of the 2002 NFL Draft. He was injured during his first year with Tampa Bay and had several brief stints with several other NFL teams over the next two seasons. Walker has yet to succeed as a professional football player. Several scouts have noted that he is not fast enough to dominate at the professional level the way he did at lower levels using other skills such as balance, strength, and size. He had signed to play in the Arena Football League in 2006 but did not play. High school Walker was born in Syracuse, New York, and was a high school football All-American for Henninger High School in Syracuse. He was also a standout basketball player who averaged over twenty points a game as a sophomore and junior, but abandoned the sport for football. In high school, he established numerous NYSPHSAA football records: career receptions (181), single-season receptions (80), and career receiving yards (3352). In addition, he recorded the second highest single-season yardage total (1190). His 13 single-season touchdowns was third in state history, and he totaled thirty-five career touchdowns for Henninger. He played defensive back and accumulated two hundred tackles and fourteen interceptions. Walker was named as the Gatorade High School Football Player of the Year for New York State, and he was named to the 1997 USAToday All-USA high school football team. He was ranked as the ninth best high school football prospect in the country in 1998 by the Sporting News. Walker's career-high school records were broken in 2004 by Bruce Williams out of Syracuse's Christian Brothers Academy, who played for the Syracuse Orange football team from 2005 through 2008. Williams took four years to break Walker's record which was set during only three years. Walker's single-season receptions record was broken in 2001 by Anthony Morat of Rome, New York's \\"Free Academy\\" who later played Division III football at the State University of New York at Cortland from 2003‚Äì2006 and earned 2006 first-team All- conference honors. Harold Jasper, whose career receiving yards record Walker broke, later played for the Iowa Hawkeyes football team and two Arena football teams. Jasper also was the only receiver to have had more single-season yards in New York State history than Walker. College career Walker is best remembered for a pair of one-handed catches he made in 2001. Before the 2002 NFL Draft, Baltimore Ravens Senior vice president of football operations, Ozzie Newsome referred to Walker's collegiate catches as some of the best catches he has seen in college in a long time. One of the one-handed catches was a touchdown catch in the back of the end zone against the Iowa Hawkeyes football team in a 32‚Äì26 comeback from a 21‚Äì7 deficit on October 27, 2001. The Post-Standard, Walker's hometown newspaper, described his grab in the Iowa game this way: \\"There he was in the corner of the end zone, as two Iowa defensive backs stalked him like sentries. The ball delivered high and wide, seemed an improbable stretch, an impossible goal. And yet, as it spiraled toward him, Marquise Walker leaped and lifted his right arm. His fingertips grazed the leather and tipped it skyward. And then, as he tumbled back to earth, he wrapped his hands around the ball and caressed it to his chest. Touchdown Michigan.\\" Walker seriously considered playing for Syracuse University of the Big East Conference, but Syracuse Orange quarterback Donovan McNabb only had one more year remaining. McNabb, who was the Big East Conference offensive player of the decade for the 1990s, was not likely to be replaced by a quarterback of equal skill. Thus, Walker went on to wear #4 at Michigan. Walker played football at Michigan from the 1998 NCAA Division I-A football season through the 2001 season, finishing his career with 176 receptions for 2,269 yards and 17 touchdowns. During his career he played on two Big Ten Championship teams (1998, 2000), but neither team went to the Rose Bowl. During his career, the two teams that he compiled the most total single- opponent receiving yards against were Michigan's fiercest conference opponents: He had 256 yards against Ohio State and 251 yards against Michigan State. His highest career single-opponent touchdown and single-opponent reception totals were also in the Michigan ‚Äì Ohio State football rivalry games and his Paul Bunyan Trophy game totals were tied for second in both of these statistics. Playing at Washington on September 8, 2001, Walker set the Michigan record for the most receptions in a game with 15, surpassing Tai Streets and Brad Myers. He tied his mark later in season against Ohio State. This record continued to stand through the 2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season. Both of Walker's 15-reception efforts came in losses. He first recorded 15 receptions against the Washington Huskies football team in a 23‚Äì18 loss where he accumulated 159 yards and two touchdowns from quarterback John Navarre. On that day he added a 13-yard run and a 15-yard punt return. Then on the November 24, 2001 day that he surpassed Carter as the career receptions leader, he totaled 15 receptions in a 26‚Äì20 loss to the Ohio State Buckeyes football team while accumulating 160 yards and two touchdowns. These two games with 160 and 159 yards receiving were Walker's career highs. His other 150 yard game came against the Michigan State football team during the same season on November 3, 2001 with nine receptions. Walker had two touchdowns in each of his three 150-yard reception games. Walker set several other records at Michigan that have been surpassed. His career reception total surpassed that of Anthony Carter as the most in school history. During his senior year in 2001, Walker set Michigan single-season records with 86 receptions and 1,143 receiving yards, surpassing Jack Clancy (who still holds the record for receptions for ten games) and David Terrell, respectively. Walker also broke Mercury Hayes' school record for most consecutive games with a reception (32 games). These marks were all surpassed by Braylon Edwards in 2004. He also set the single-season 100-yard games record with six. This mark has been surpassed by both Edwards and Mario Manningham. During his time at Michigan he blocked a total of four punts. One block set up a field goal in Michigan's 2001 20‚Äì17 victory against Wisconsin at Camp Randall Stadium. The NCAA Division I-A career record was seven when he completed his eligibility and is now ten, and the Big Ten record was five and is now six based on the NCAA record book. The total continues to be a Michigan record by virtue of the fact that the NCAA record book does not recognize any Michigan player as having recorded more than four. However, some press reports credit Ed Frutig with five punt blocks during the eight-game 1940 season. Walker's statistics ranked him highly in Big Ten Conference history. Both his single-game reception total of 15 and his single-season reception total of 86 were sixth in Big Ten history at the end of his career although both were ninth all time through the 2006 NCAA season. Walker won both the Big Ten Conference games and Big Ten all games receptions titles in 2001. He ranked sixth in the nation in receptions per game with 7.36 and 17th in reception yards per game with 94.82. During the 2001 season, his 1177 yards from scrimmage (1143 yards receiving and 34 rushing) edged out B. J. Askew's 1138 yards (236 yards receiving and 902 rushing) for the team lead in yards from scrimmage. In addition, he threw a 51-yard pass completion to Jermaine Gonzales, and he compiled 206 yards as a punt returner. As a result, he also led the team in All-purpose yards. In a game against the Purdue Boilermakers on October 13, 2001, he totaled 249 yards of total offense, including 134 yards on seven receptions and 112 yards on seven punt returns. Walker earned team MVP honors for the 2001 season. He was a Biletnikoff Award finalist. Among his All-American recognitions were a first-team selection by the American Football Coaches Association, a second-team selection by the Associated Press, and an honorable mention by CNNSI.com. Professional career Jon Gruden made Walker his first draft pick as Buccaneer head coach. Scouts for the professional football teams described Walker as a \\"Big physical receiver, who uses his size to muscle the ball away from defenders...Lacks explosive speed, but has the exceptional body control and balance.\\" In another scouting report he was described as a \\"Striding-type runner who is not quick or sudden. Dominates average defensive backs but has a hard time getting separation vs. a good corner\\" Indirect questioning during interviews, Walker confessed that he never had run a 40-yard dash and did not practice straight- line speed. Thus, there was some consensus that he did not have the speed to play wide receiver in the National Football League and that he did not work on his speed. It was also said that he \\"Lacks soft hands and will do a lot of double-catching and body-catching. Has a lot of drops for a featured No. 1 receiver.\\" When Jon Gruden took over the head coaching job of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from Tony Dungy, he made Walker his first draft selection in the 2002 NFL Draft with the 86th overall selection that came in the third round of the draft. Although Walker was the property of the Buccaneers for the 2002 NFL season, he did not appear in any games. Walker had been behind Keyshawn Johnson, Joe Jurevicius and Keenan McCardell on the Buccaneer 2002 depth chart. Then, he injured his ankle in August and was inactive for the first four games of the season. He was injured in September with torn ligaments in his thumb and had season ending surgery,Original link to Buccaneer team website (http://www.buccaneers.com/bucsnet/ne...px?newsid=3074) is dead for a story entitled \\"One to Build On: Marquise Walker\\" from June 12, 2003 cited at http://www.arizonasportsfans.com/vb/showthread.php?t=11389 which caused the Buccaneers to place him on injured reserve in October. Thus, he was not on the game roster for the Super Bowl XXXVII Champion Buccaneers. He was traded to the Arizona Cardinals for running back Thomas Jones prior to the 2003 NFL season after the Cardinals lost their top three wide receivers (including David Boston and Frank Sanders) to free agency. He was cut by the Cardinals on August 23, 2003 and picked up by the Cincinnati Bengals on August 25, 2003 who released him on August 27, 2003. The Tennessee Titans briefly placed him on their practice squad while trying to convert him to tight end later during the season, and the Miami Dolphins worked him out at different times during the season. Walker, who had signed with the Super Bowl Champion New England Patriots in February prior to the 2004 NFL season for the league minimum $305,000, was released by the Patriots on July 21, 2004. Walker signed with the Orlando Predators of the Arena Football League to play wide receiver and linebacker for Predator head coach Jay Gruden during the 2006 Arena Football League season. Gruden was also an offensive assistant coach with the Super Bowl XXXVII champion Buccaneers. Walker was waived by the Predators, and he has yet to play in the Arena Football League.

(The third direction, normal to the magnetic surfaces, is often called the \\"radial direction\\", denoted by x in the slab approximation and variously \\\\psi, \\\\chi, r, \\\\rho, or s in magnetic coordinates.) Example As a simple example from the physics of magnetically confined plasmas, consider an axisymmetric system with circular, concentric magnetic flux surfaces of radius r (a crude approximation to the magnetic field geometry in an early tokamak but topologically equivalent to any toroidal magnetic confinement system with nested flux surfaces) and denote the toroidal angle by \\\\zeta and the poloidal angle by \\\\theta. Then the Toroidal/Poloidal coordinate system relates to standard Cartesian Coordinates by these transformation rules: : x = (R_0 +r \\\\cos \\\\theta) \\\\cos\\\\zeta : y = s_\\\\zeta (R_0 + r \\\\cos \\\\theta) \\\\sin\\\\zeta : z = s_\\\\theta r \\\\sin \\\\theta. where s_\\\\theta = \\\\pm 1, s_\\\\zeta = \\\\pm 1. The natural choice geometrically is to take s_\\\\theta = s_\\\\zeta = +1, giving the toroidal and poloidal directions shown by the arrows in the figure above, but this makes r,\\\\theta,\\\\zeta a left-handed curvilinear coordinate system. As it is usually assumed in setting up coordinates for describing magnetically confined plasmas that the set r,\\\\theta,\\\\zeta forms a right-handed coordinate system, abla r\\\\cdot abla\\\\theta\\\\times abla\\\\zeta > 0, we must either reverse the poloidal direction by taking s_\\\\theta = -1, s_\\\\zeta = +1, or reverse the toroidal direction by taking s_\\\\theta = +1, s_\\\\zeta = -1. Both choices are used in the literature. Kinematics To study single particle motion in toroidally confined plasma devices, velocity and acceleration vectors must be known. Considering the natural choice s_\\\\theta = s_\\\\zeta = +1, the unit vectors of toroidal and poloidal coordinates system \\\\left(r,\\\\theta,\\\\zeta\\\\right) can be expressed as: : \\\\mathbf{e}_r = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\cos\\\\zeta \\\\ \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\sin\\\\zeta \\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{e}_\\\\theta = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -\\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\cos\\\\zeta \\\\ -\\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\sin\\\\zeta \\\\ \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{e}_\\\\zeta = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -\\\\sin\\\\zeta \\\\ \\\\cos\\\\zeta \\\\ 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} according to Cartesian coordinates. The position vector is expressed as: : \\\\mathbf{r} = \\\\left( r + R_0 \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\right) \\\\mathbf{e}_r - R_0 \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{e}_\\\\theta The velocity vector is then given by: : \\\\mathbf{\\\\dot{r}} = \\\\dot{r} \\\\mathbf{e}_r + r\\\\dot{\\\\theta} \\\\mathbf{e}_\\\\theta + \\\\dot{\\\\zeta} \\\\left( R_0 + r \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\right) \\\\mathbf{e}_\\\\zeta and the acceleration vector is: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{\\\\ddot{r}} = {} & \\\\left( \\\\ddot{r} - r \\\\dot{\\\\theta}^2 - r \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}^2 \\\\cos^2\\\\theta - R_0 \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}^2 \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\right) \\\\mathbf{e}_r [5pt] & {} + \\\\left( 2\\\\dot{r}\\\\dot{\\\\theta} + r\\\\ddot{\\\\theta} + r\\\\dot{\\\\zeta}^2\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\sin\\\\theta + R_0 \\\\dot{\\\\zeta}^2 \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\right) \\\\mathbf{e}_\\\\theta [5pt] & {} + \\\\left( 2 \\\\dot{r}\\\\dot{\\\\zeta}\\\\cos\\\\theta - 2 r \\\\dot{\\\\theta}\\\\dot{\\\\zeta} \\\\sin\\\\theta + \\\\ddot{\\\\zeta} \\\\left( R_0 + r\\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\right) \\\\right) \\\\mathbf{e}_\\\\zeta \\\\end{align} See also * Toroidal coordinates * Torus * Zonal and poloidal * Poloidal‚Äìtoroidal decomposition * Zonal flow (plasma) References * * Category:Coordinate systems ","title":"Toroidal and poloidal coordinates"},{"id":"12700263","text":"Chorthippus acroleucus is a species of grasshopper found in Romania.IORGU, I., E.

Pomo Afro Homos in Anchorage , retrieved 2007-08-09Pomo Afro Homos co-founder dies at 43 retrieved 2007-08-09 Behind the scenes The original concept of the group was to show the issues affecting each black gay person, from family issues and AIDS to acceptance within the community and racism. These issues were controversial during this era because in the 90's, famous athlete Magic Johnson had admitted to acquiring HIV from having multiple sex partners. David Roman had referenced these issues including the play Six Degrees of Separation, comparing them to one another because of their influence on the same subjects. Roman complemented the Pomo's on their bravery to show these subjects instead of backing down from the rejection they received in certain places.Rom√°n, David. Acts of Intervention: Performance, Gay Culture, And AIDS. Indiana University Press, 1998. The Pomo's shows started with a low budget, so they had few props, and the focus was on the actors. Many of the skits were based on Freeman's, Gupton's, and Branner's experience with their homosexuality and the society around them. The skits were portrayed by parodying, over acting, and truly speaking out about the problems they were faced with. In an article by Stephen Holden critiquing the Pomo's show, Dark Fruit (one of the Pomo's later pieces) is more comedic than Fierce Love. Holden praises Freeman for his acting and being able to expose himself on stage. He critiques Branner for his lack of charisma, but still complements him for being soft and moving.\\"Review/Performance Art; Gentle Souls of Gay, Black Defiance\\". The New York Times, July 27, 1993. Fame and controversy The group performed at Lincoln Center and elsewhere nationally.

History The Di√°rio dos A√ßores was founded by Manuel Augusto Tavares de Resende (1849-1892) in 1870, influenced by the publication five years before, in Lisbon of the Di√°rio de Not√≠cias. He headed the newspaper until his death in 1892.Concei√ß√£o Tavares et al. (2009), p. 4 Tavares de Resende was a \\"self-made man\\", who began as a typographer, then bought his own printing press and began the Di√°rio, becoming a pioneer in the Azores with his dedication and innovation. Operating a daily newspaper was difficult (previous newspapers had been fortnightly) not only in technical terms, but also because, from a monetary point of view, many people thought the enterprise would fail. In an environment where literacy was poor, it was difficult to providing a constant circulation, with limited graphics capabilities and limited overseas news sources. To attract subscribers and readers, Tavares de Resende offered gifts and cash through a lottery. He also set up a network of correspondents throughout the island of S√£o Miguel, the Azores archipelago, and outside the region. By the beginning of the 20th century, the Di√°rio dos A√ßores was already situated along a line of traditional 19th century journalism. The paper was journalistically compromised, not just ideologically oriented or supporter of defined political parties, but that its role was political. The paper obtained much of its prestige from progressive supporters of local monarchist intelligentsia. In 1892 when Tavares de Resende died, his nephew Manuel Resende Carreiro (? - 1939) succeeded him as director, remaining for the next 47 years, during which time he introduced the children's supplement Miau in 1934, which introduced many readers to the newspaper. During the tenure of Manuel and Carlos (Manuel's brother) Carreiro, the Di√°rio dos A√ßores witnessed a renaissance. The newspaper was the first S√£o Miguel newspaper to use mechanical composition, introducing the Intertype machine in 1965, and by 1970 two such machines were in use. The Carreiro brothers also had the honour of preparing the commemorative edition, Bodas de Diamante, in 1945, which according to many surpassed the best special editions of the metropolitan newspapers. In 1970 Manuel Cabral de Melo wrote a special supplement commemorating the newspaper's centennial.

Its natural habitats are rivers and freshwater springs. It is threatened by habitat loss. The specific part of the scientific name, mercuriale, is because of the distinctive markings on the second segment of the abdomen that resembles the astrological symbol for the planet Mercury - ‚òø. This also gives the species an alternative common name of mercury bluet. Habitat They require areas of open vegetation, mixed with slow flowing water in which to lay their eggs. The larvae spend 2 years underwater before emerging as damselflies. Status in the United Kingdom It is thought that 25% of the world population exists within the United Kingdom but it has declined by 30% since 1960 due to changes in grazing, land drainage and water abstraction. Places where they are found include the New Forest, Hampshire, Oxfordshire and the Preseli Hills, Pembrokeshire, where work was being carried out in 2015 to improve habitat, work that was reported in 2020 as successful.

With hop-by-hop transport, chunks of data are forwarded from node to node in a store-and-forward manner. As hop-by-hop transport involves not only the source and destination node, but rather some or all of the intermediate nodes as well, it allows data to be forwarded even if the path between source and destination is not permanently connected during communication. However, the End-to-end principle claims that transport control should be implemented end-to-end unless implementing hop-by-hop transport achieves considerably better performance. Moreover, hop-by-hop transport requires per-flow state information at intermediate nodes, which limits its scalability. This is one of the reasons why almost all communication today is controlled by end-to-end transport protocols such as TCP. Current research in the area of sparse mobile networks is considering hop-by-hop transport for application scenarios where end-to-end connectivity is only available intermittently, as under such conditions, hop-by-hop transport can achieve substantial performance gains.

It is part of the Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park. Location Cortegada island is part of an archipelago that includes the Malveiras Islands or Bri√±as Islands, Cies, Ons, and Salvora,Iter Europe:Ilas Atl·∫•ntoas: Pontevedra. and‚Äîthe largest and the most populated one‚ÄîA Illa de Arousa. Cortegada, due to its location near the mouth of the river Ulla, is sheltered from the wind within an estuary named \\"r√≠a de Arousa\\". This and its topography give it environmental conditions more favourable to hydrophilic woodland than the other islands of the National Park. The island is connected to the mainland via a tidal causeway, a trackway 189 metres wide covered at high tide and revealed at low tide. A track was built on the sandbar and it has stabilized a breeding ground for clams as a commercial clam hatchery. The tides in the area change quickly, and can be dangerous for pedestrians on the causeway. History Originally the site of a village of the municipally of O Carril (today Vilagarc√≠a de Arousa), at the start of the 20th century, Cortegada was expropriated from its 211 tenants, on the initiative of a local businessman, with the intention of building a royal summer retreat. Offered as a present to King Alfonso XIII of Spain, who visited the island just once. in September 1907, Cortegada was sold by his son Don Juan de Borb√≥n in 1978 to a private company. It was recently bought back by the government and added to the mentioned Natural Park. The island had been inhabited until the late 19th century and used to site a monastery, hospital and leper house or lazar house. It has the remains of several stone houses, sheds and storerooms, a 17th- century stone chapel and a dock. The island has been transformed by man. The nutrients supplied by human action created a fertile topsoil. Fertilization due to crops, livestock excrement and bird colonies has caused a change in soil composition favoring some species over others. In 2007, in a TV documentary for public television of Galicia some old people descended from islanders, recalled how the island was divided into farms and agricultural land, without tree cover. The present day laurel woods are descended from isolated examples in orchards. Characteristics Cortegada has an oceanic climate with warm summers, and cool mild winters. The dense moisture from the ocean is precipitating constantly. Warm moist air masses blowing off the ocean are forced upwards by the terrain, which cools the air mass to the dew point, causing the moisture in the air to condense as rain or fog, creating a habitat characterized by cool, moist conditions in the air and soil. The resulting climate is wetter and mild, with the annual oscillation of the temperature moderated by the ocean. It has two main fresh water sources: a seasonal lagoon and subterranean fresh water. This last source is peculiar since the island is surrounded by salt water, everybody can dig a well without effort even near the beach, without the need of digging further than several tens of centimetres, around ten inches at the most. The island is almost flat, its highest elevation is 22 feet high. It has an area of 54 hectares of land with a rectangle shape. Due to the large amount of water in the terrain, it flows in streams everywhere or stay quiet in ponds and puddles. The water drips, cover and soak the plants, rocks, soil, logs, moss etc. and still the water is being impassable the island during heavy rain. However the beauty of the set make it a tourist attraction. Ecology Cortegada island is valued by many researchers and scientists, as well as by the richness of its sea, for having on its north side the largest forest of bay laurel that exists in Europe. Ligustrum, Buxus, and bitter orange are some other species on Cortegada with laurel tree shape. From a distance, the island appears to be completely covered with dense woodland; it is renowned for having the last wild laurel forest of Galicia as well as a mixed population of stone pine (Pinus pinea) and maritime pine (Pinus pinaster), and a large oak forest with Quercus robur, Quercus suber, and Quercus pyrenaica. This forest formerly covered much of the coast and coastal mountains of the mainland surrounding and other Atlantic islands in the area with locally favourable wet climate microenvironments, but those forests have been much reduced in extent by logging, clearance for agriculture and grazing, and the invasion of exotic species. The type forests are made up of laurel-leaved evergreen hardwood trees, reaching up to 40 m in height when older. Many of the species are endemic to islands, and harbour a rich biota of understorey plants, invertebrates, some species of lizards (Lacerta lepida, Podarcis bocagei, Chalcides striatus), slowworms (Anguis fragilis), and snakes, (Elaphe scalaris, Coronella girondica, Natrix maura). The island has some goats and wild boars (Sus scrofa), wild horses lived there until recently (Crocidura russula, Erinaceus europaeus, Talpa occidentalis), bats (Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Eptesicus serotinus, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), feral cats (Felix catus), feral mink (Mustela vison), rabbits, mice, rats and birds such as Iberian chiffchaff, the coal tit, the great tit, woodpecker, Eurasian wryneck, collared dove, common wood pigeon, blackbird, Scolopax rusticola, greenfinch, warbler, finch, saithe, stonechat, robin, goldfinch, wagtail, black redstart, buzzard, goshawk, and peregrine falcon. Besides many seabirds species such as cormorants and shorebirds take refuge on the island and several species of gulls nest in the breeding season. The scrubland is formed mainly of autochthonous species, like gorse, broom, spurge flax (Thymelaea), rockrose (Cistaceae), sea pink (Armeria maritima), spiny thrift (Armeria pungens), Corema album, etc. Typically the marshland flora like rushes and other grow in the area of the lagoon and the ponds. The woodland supports a diverse understorey of ferns such as Davallia canariensis (a Macaronesian epilithic fern species) and bryophytes, which require moisture for reproduction, this vegetation besides cover the ruins of the old stone houses with mosses, lichens and creepers. There are numerous herbaceous plants such as genus Sedum, Teucrium scorodonia, stinking iris (Iris foetidissima), Xolantha guttata, Melissa officinalis, Symphytum officinalis, Vinca difformis, Aeonium sp., Hyacinthoides sp. etc. and several species of grasses.http://www.parquenacionalillasatlanticas.com/spa/informacion_saber_mas.php?nar1=28 Some evergreen climbing plants like asparagus species and Araliaceaes as Hedera helix, or Hedera iberica. Various feral fruit trees species occur, such as apple, plum and pear trees, Citrus aurantium, Vitis vinifera, common fig, hazelnut, walnut, Chesnut. The trees Salix atrocinerea, Alnus glutinosa, Platanus √ó hispanica Populus nigra, Ulmus, and allochthonous Cupressaceae are widespread, as are the bird-dispersed shrubs Ligustrum, honeysuckle Lonicera periclymenum, Prunus lusitanica, Prunus spinosa, Crataegus monogyna, Sorbus, Buxus, Osyris, European Mistletoe, Cornus, Taxus baccata, Ulex europaeus subsp. latebracteatus, Rubus ulmifolius, Tamus communis, and Ilex aquifolium. There are two constituent species in the genus Laurus Laurus nobilis and Laurus azorica known as Azores Laurel, a native to the laurel forests of the Azores, was also locally introduced in Cortegada Island. These recent forest are young yet with trees 18‚Äì20 m tall following the eviction of the last inhabitants. Ferns, liverworts, mosses and lichens grow up the trunks and branches. Creepers and vines complete the tangle. A recent study found considerable genetic diversity within L. nobilis, and that L. azorica is not genetically or morphologically distinct. This populations like the Cortegada Island population, famous for its large grove of laurels, come from seeds dispersed by birds but is not indigenous to the island, as this islander forest originated spontaneously from laurel specimens that were planted after the original vegetation was destroyed. The location of the Islands in the North Atlantic Ocean maintained the humid and relatively mild climate which has allowed these forests to persist to the present day, although autochthonous vegetation was almost entirely cleared for orchards, wheat fields, subsistence crops and exotic timber plantations of eucalyptus, mostly Eucalyptus globulus, pine and oak in the past. The forest regenerated easily, its decline was due to the tremendous pressure it supported. The most common epilithic plants are Umbilicus rupestris and the ferns Polypodium interjectum and Davallia canariensis. The willows are very numerous and the laurels of Cortegada live in the soils with standing water. The understorey of these Laurel forest is low, falling almost to the ground lined with ivy, along with some wood-sage plants (Teucrium scorodonia) and snakeroot (Arisarum vulgare). Willows (Salix atrocinerea) occupy the eastern part of the island in permanently or temporarily waterlogged soils as the only tree species, mono- specific forest, and on the west side are mixed with alder (Alnus glutinosa). The Marsh Vegetation provides food for the large herbivores.  Gallery  File:Isla de Cortegada Vela Latina.JPG File:Isla de Cortegada.JPG File:Cortegada mosteiro.PNGCruceiro (Cross).

Colophon beetles are also known as Barnard's stag beetles after Dr. Keppel Harcourt Barnard (1887‚Äì1964), who pioneered studies of this genus while working at the South African Museum. Barnard's mountaineering interest first brought him into contact with the genus, and many species of the beetles were named after his mountaineering friends. Indiscriminate collecting and habitat destruction, especially from fires as the beetles are flightless, are so threatening to the genus, it has been placed under the protection of nature conservation laws in South Africa, with C. primosi being particularly endangered. Being flightless makes recolonisation of burnt areas more difficult for these beetles. Though little is known of its lifecycle and habitat requirements, this has not deterred Japanese and European collectors of C. primosi. Consequently, the genus has been placed on CITES Appendix II, banning all trade, exchange, or sale of the insects. TRAFFIC has reported on insect trade fairs in Germany where tens of thousands of specimens have been offered for sale, and has called for threatened butterfly and beetle species to be placed under EU Wildlife Trade protection.Wood Southern Africa - August 2010 vol.35/10 References Category:Lucaninae Category:Endemic beetles of South Africa Category:Beetles described in 1929 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Colophon primosi"},{"id":"12700460","text":"Colophon stokoei is a species of beetle in family Lucanidae.

It is the third game in the Pin-Bot series, following Pin-Bot (1986) and The Machine: Bride of Pin-Bot (1991). Description This game has a futuristic casino theme. Certain elements of the original Pin-Bot table carry over to this Jack-Bot, such as the spiral ramp, visor targets, and locking the balls in the holes to activate Pin-Bot's eyes. Jon Hey created the music and sound which includes a new arrangement of the Pin-Bot theme previously composed for Williams Pinball by Chris Granner. Game quotes * \\"Double or Nothing\\" Ball purchase/Extra ball button Jack-Bot also allows players to buy an extra ball for one credit, and then pressing the \\"EXTRA BALL\\" button; players can buy a maximum of three balls this way. The game, has two separate high score lists: one for games without buy-ins, and one including buy-ins. The Grand Champion is the highest score of scores where no buy-ins were involved. Pressing the EXTRA BALL button can also activate various cheats if done properly, such as Pin*Bot changing the results of a dice roll. Pressing the EXTRA BALL button during attract mode activates a message on the dot-matrix display, which reads, \\"In memory of Joe Joos, Jr.,\\" who had died a year earlier; the display then tells the player a brief biography on Joos. Objectives The game has two main objectives: to activate Casino Run and to start Multi-Ball; during Multi-Ball, the objective is to score enough Jack*Bots (jackpots) to light Mega Visor. Table Details and Rules=Vortex Skill Shot As in the original Pin-Bot, the plunger launches the ball towards a spiral ramp known as the Vortex, which has a top, middle, and bottom section. To score the highest value offered, shoot the ball into the middle section. The vortex value resets to 10 million for each ball unless it is held (see below). Shooting the middle vortex hole during Multi- Ball can score a Jack*Bot. Hit Me A touch target just above the right inlane/outlane area. Hitting this target randomly draws a card to add to the player's total (starting from zero), with the goal being to reach 21 (as in blackjack) or get as close as possible without busting (going over 21). Each time the target is hit, the player scores 1 million points times the total (i.e., bringing the hand to 17 scores 17 million points). Hitting 21 exactly or busting resets the total to zero, but if the player hits 21 exactly, they win a 50 million point bonus. Aces can count as 1 or 11, as in regular blackjack. The Hit Me target can also be used to score up to 75 million points during the Hurry-Up Mode, and for scoring Jack*Bots during Multi-Ball. Poker Targets To the left just beneath the ramp, there are three poker targets. One is lit during play; hitting the lit target advances the bonus multiplier up to 5x. If an unlit target is hit, the player must wait until the targets reset before trying again. If the lit target is hit, and the player hits the two other targets before they reset, the machine spots the player a poker card to be used in the game Pin-Bot Poker (see below). Cashier Target Underneath the left ramp is a cashier target. When activated, the ramp will lift up to allow the ball to go underneath to hit it. Hitting this target can do a variety of things for the player: score the bonus during Cashier Mode, collect the Solar Jets award, doubles the winnings for a casino game, and collect Jack*Bots during Multi-Ball. Ramp and Vortex Increaser When the ramp is down, shooting the ball up the ramp and over to the mini- bagatelle playfield (a carry-over from the original Pin-Bot) begins the Vortex Counter, which gradually adds 1 million points to the value of the vortex (starting from 10 million), up to a maximum of 50 million points. The ball then will randomly make its way either through the hole, activating Solar Jets Mode, down to the right inlane, which will award a random award (which changes in synchronization with the Vortex Counter), or back to the plunger for another skill shot. =Solar Jets= If the ball falls through this hole and into the bumpers, it triggers Solar Jets mode. The ramp flips up; the player then has about 20 seconds (represented by a slow countdown from 10) to hit the Cashier target to score the Solar Jets value, which starts at 40M and goes up by 4M for each bumper hit. Starting Multiball or Casino Run before the timer runs out will also score the Solar Jets award. =Inlane Awards= If the ball goes through the right inlane, it will trigger one of the following awards: *25 Million: Awards 25 million points. *Cashier: The player has 20 seconds (represented by a slow countdown from 10) to hit the Cashier target and score twice the bonus value (though this replaces the end-of-ball bonus instead of adding to it). Starting Multi-Ball or Casino Run also awards the Cashier value. *Light Extra Ball: Lights an extra ball light. *Mega Ramp: Lights the left ramp. The player must shoot the ball up the ramp within 5 seconds to win the Mega Ramp value, starting at 50 million, and increasing 25 million each time it is achieved. Game Saucer The Game Saucer is a narrow lane leading to a ball trap that is located just to the right of the left ramp. Shoot the ball into this trap to begin a casino game. During Multi- Ball, shoot the ball into this trap to collect a Jack*Bot, and during Casino Run, this trap is one of several that can be used to spin the wheels on the slot machine. Visor and 5x5 Grid Keno Lights As in the original Pin-Bot, the machine has a visor that begins the game closed, and a 5x5 grid of lights underneath it, colored yellow, blue, orange, green, and red, in that order. Above the lights are a visor row of targets that light the lights vertically in columns, and to the right side is a side row of lights that light the lights in each row horizontally. To open the visor, the player either needs to complete the grid by hitting the targets in any order, or by shooting the correct visor or side row target when the lights are initially flashing; the lights initially flash one column at a time, left to right, and then one row at a time, top to bottom. In the latter case, opening the visor by shooting the correct target awards a 50 million point bonus (after this is done, however, the machine requires the player to open the visor each subsequent time by just completing all 25 lights on the grid in any order). In Jack-Bot, the lights are known as Keno Lights, and each column also has a white arrow above it. When the visor is closed, shooting the ball into the target when the white arrow is lit awards a Keno Award: *:Vortex at Max: Automatically brings the vortex value to 50 million. *:Add Vortex Value: Increases the value of the vortex if it isn't already at 50 million. *:Vortex Held: Carries the value of the vortex over to the next ball, including extra balls. *:25M: Awards 25 million points. *:Add Poker Card: Spots an extra poker card for Pin-Bot Poker. *:5X Bonus: Brings the bonus multiplier to 5X, the maximum available in the game. (Note that after the ball drains, pressing the EXTRA BALL button enough times to activate a cheat results in Pin-Bot slamming the 5X graphic, making it 6X; this is the only time a player can get a 6X Bonus.) *:Game Saucer Lit: Before the first Multi-Ball, and only before the first Multi-Ball, if the Game Saucer isn't lit, hitting the arrow will light the saucer. *:Extra Ball: Awards an extra ball; usually awarded only on the last ball if the player's total score is under 300 million points. When the visor opens, the player can lock a ball into one of Pin-Bot's eye sockets; doing so puts another ball to the plunger, and locking the second ball begins Multi-Ball. If the visor is open, and the player hasn't started Multi-Ball yet, completing all 25 lights a second time lights an Extra Ball light above the inlane and outlane roll- overs. Extra Ball The inlane and outlane roll-overs have an extra ball light above them, which the player collects by getting the ball to roll over the lit inlane or outlane. It is possible to have more than one light lit and collect multiple Extra Balls. Multi-Ball To start Multi-Ball, the player needs to lock both balls in the eye sockets of Pin-Bot. The first Multi-Ball is a 2-ball Multi-Ball, while subsequent Multi-Balls are 3-ball Multi-Balls; in the latter case, the player must shoot a ball from the plunger to the vortex to start Multi-Ball. During Multi-Ball, Jack*bots are lit at the Eyes, at the Cashier target, and at Hit Me. The first Jack*Bot a player scores in a game is worth 50 million; future Jack*bots increase in value by 25M each time, so that the eleventh Jack*bot is 300M. Then the value starts advancing by 50M for each Jack*bot, so that the fifteenth and final Jack*bot is 500M. Collecting a Jack*bot turns that location's light off; at least one location will always be lit. If the player collects Jack*Bots at all four places, the Cashier target will be relit, and the lit location will move from left-to- right (to the left Eye, then the right, then Hit Me, then back to Cashier) each time it is collected. Hitting the Game Saucer relights all four Jack*bot locations. If you hit it when all four are already lit, it scores a Jack*bot instead. Collecting Jack*bot at one of the Eyes, then hitting the other Eye (lit or not) within a second, scores a Super Jack*bot instead. This triples the points (thus; a Super Jack*bot can be as high as 1.5 billion points). Multi-ball ends when the player is down to one ball in play. There is about a three-second grace period during which a Jack*bot can still be scored. If the player loses a Multi-ball without scoring any Jack*bots at all, they are given a 10-second restart period; hitting the Eyes or the Game Saucer before the time runs out restarts a two-ball Multi-ball with a skill shot at the plunger. Only one restart per Multi-ball is allowed, however; if this occurs a second time, the player has to start from scratch. After Multi-ball is over, the Visor will remain open until the game decides that the ball is in a place where it won't get caught behind the Visor when it closes. The ramp, the Cashier target, the Game Saucer, the rubber below the Game Saucer, the Poker Targets, and the Solar Jets will all trigger the Visor to close. As soon as the Visor starts closing, the Keno card will reset (with a row or column flashing for an instant Visor re-open), ready for the player to start refilling it. Mega Visor Once the player has accumulated 15 or more Jack*Bots (including Super Jack*Bots), the Mega Visor mode is active. The Visor closes; the object now is to re-open it. The side row targets are ignored; only the Visor targets themselves count, and each hit spots one light in the column you hit, with 50M awarded for each light spotted. Twenty-five hits are needed to complete the card, which means a potential 1.5 billion points can be scored along the way. The player can hit any combination of colors to open the Visor. When the visor opens up, the player can lock the balls in the eye sockets as before, and doing so earns a chance at a Mega Jack*Bot (always valued at least 1 billion points per Jack*Bot, although the Machine will still say \\"Super Jack*Bot!\\" when this is achieved). To score a Mega Jack*Bot, shoot the ball up the left ramp after locking a ball. Casino Games To activate Casino Run, the player first needs to play all four Casino games. Games are initiated by hitting the Game Saucer when it is lit during single-ball play; if it's not lit, hitting the ramp or Cashier target will relight it, as will the Keno awards the first time through. Before the first Casino Run is unlocked, the Game Saucer will always be lit at the start of each ball; for the second and subsequent Casino Runs, the player must hit the ramp or Cashier to relight it. (Also, the Cashier target stops relighting the Game Saucer; the player has to make actual ramp shots.) The Casino Games There are four games in total Pin-Bot can play: Pin-Bot Poker, the Slot Machine, Roll the Dice, and Keno. Pressing the EXTRA BALL button repeatedly when it flashes gives the player an opportunity to cheat at the games, but this doesn't always happen. In all four games, the machine will ask the player to either accept the total or attempt \\"DOUBLE OR NOTHING.\\" If the player chooses to double, they have a limited time to shoot the ball under the left ramp and hit the Cashier target. Doing so doubles the player's winnings; if time expires or the ball is lost, no points are scored for that game. If the player takes too long to respond, the game will automatically pick the option to simply collect the bonus. =Pin-Bot Poker= This game uses the poker hand displayed at the center of the playfield. The Poker Targets, Keno awards, Casino Run, and Slot Machine can all light cards in this hand. (Completing the hand the first time lights an Extra Ball.) Points are awarded based on the value of the hand: 10 million points for a single deuce, 15 million for an ace or ace-deuce, 20 million for one pair, 30 million for two pair or three of a kind, or 50 million for a full house (all five cards). In addition, a flat 50 million is scored for each hand the player has already filled. The resulting total can be doubled later. If the player successfully cheats, Pin-Bot pulls an extra Ace from his sleeve. (\\"Ace of Clubs?\\") This can give players a hand that is normally impossible: four Aces, worth 149M million points. (Players can still double this to 298 million if they wish.) =Slot Machine= The slot machine wheels spin and reveal a random award: *Multi-Ball: Starts Multi- Ball. *Special: Awards a Special; typically one credit and 500 million points. *Add 10 Cards: Adds 2 complete poker hands to the player's grand total. *Hurry Up: Starts a timer that counts down from 75 million to 15 million; the player must shoot the \\"Hit Me\\" target in order to collect the bonus. *Collect Bonus: Awards the player the bonus they would have received if they had lost the ball. *Vortex at Max: Sets the Vortex value to 50 million automatically. *Hold Vortex Value: Carries the Vortex value over to the next ball (including extra balls). *Bonus: Awards a random bonus generally between 25 million and 40 million points. Players have the option to double the winnings if they wish. *Lite Extra Ball: Lights the extra ball. This is the hardest of the games to successfully cheat, but if done, Pin-Bot will slam the reels, and it will change to \\"Extra Ball Lit.\\" =Roll the Dice= The game is based on the \\"Dice Game Wager\\" which begins at 3 million points, and increases by 100,000 points each time the ball makes contact with the bumpers located just below the mini-bagatelle playfield (known as the Solar Jet Bumpers). The Machine rolls the dice, and whatever she rolls is multiplied by the Dice Game Wager (i.e. 5,500,000 x 6 = 33,000,000). Players can then decide to double if they wish. If the player successfully cheats, Pin-Bot will simply flick the dice so that the result is always a 12, and announce, \\"BOXCARS!\\" =Keno= This game is based on the Keno card (the 5x5 grid of lights under the visor); the player's progress on the grid determines how many squares are chosen for the random drawing. Six squares are picked at random, and the player wins 5 million points per square matched, plus 5 million points just for participating. If all six squares match, the player wins 50 million points. Players also win an additional 25 million points for every card filled previously. In the event the player has less than five squares lit on the grid, the game will allow the player to use the full center column to give them a chance at making some matches. If the player successfully does a cheat, Pin-Bot will slam the whole card, giving the result that 25 matches were made, awarding the player 99 million points. As before, the player can then decide whether or not they want to try and double the winnings. Casino Run After all four games have been played, the Casino Run mode is activated; the player must shoot the Game Saucer trap again to activate it. During this run, the player has 45 seconds to spin the wheels as many times as possible. Shooting the Game Saucer trap or one of Pin-Bot's eye sockets spins the wheels. The player then has to decide whether to collect the bonus and end the run, or risk it and continue playing. Players can unlock an Easter egg by pressing the EXTRA BALL button when it flashes during the introductory sequence to Casino Run, and if successful, they will see a cow jumping over the moon. Spins of the wheels can award the following: *Points: Various point values. Sometimes the spaces might be left blank, but this doesn't affect the player any. *Lite Extra Ball: Lights an extra ball, which can later be collected when the inlanes and outlanes are lit. Extra balls are at risk for being lost if the player runs out of time or spins a bomb. *Special: Awards a special, which also runs the risk of being lost. If the player collects their bank, they win the special. *Vortex X: Adds a skill shot multiplier to the Vortex. *Poker Card: Adds a poker card to the current poker hand (which can also light the extra ball). *Jack*Bot: Adds a Jack*Bot to the player's total number of Jack*Bots; the points are scored immediately and do not count toward the total in the Casino Run Bank. *:More Time: Adds 15 seconds to the timer, though it never exceeds 45. *:Cow: The player wins an automatic special without having to risk it. *:No Bomb: The player wins no points, but wins a bucket of water. *:Bomb: Ends the player's run and erases all points and awards earned up to that point. If the player spun a \\"No Bomb\\" earlier, or spins a Bomb and No Bomb together, the effect of the bomb is cancelled, and the machine will flash \\"BOMB DIFFUSED.\\" While the timer is counting down, the player's Casino Run Bank, which begins at 100 million points, adds 4 million points each time the ball hits a switch, rollover, or bumper. Players must remember that the clock is ticking; if time expires, they lose everything in their bank. The game awards a credit at the end of its conclusion after the player enters their initials if they have the highest total Casino Run score to date. The game also has an Easter egg hidden; if the player holds both flippers while the wheels are spinning, they might instead receive a hint for the game Mortal Kombat 3. Getting the hint also awards an extra ball. End-of-Ball Bonus The following criteria applies to scoring for the end-of-ball bonus: *Cards: 3 million for each Poker and Hit Me card collected during the game. *Vortex Value: Whatever the current skill shot value is (without the multiplier) is what is added. This will be between 10 million and 50 million. *Dice Game Wager: Whatever the current wager is at that point is what is added. The entire bonus then gets multiplied by the bonus multiplier; this will be between 1x and 5x. If the player presses the EXTRA BALL button repeatedly during the bonus count, Pin-Bot may cheat on the bonus multiplier by slamming the screen; this gives an extra bonus X. Cheating successfully in this manner is the only way to achieve a 6X. The bonus multiplier must be at least 2X to allow the player to cheat. Buy-Ins and High Score Lists The player is allowed up to 3 buy-ins following the last ball, for a maximum of six total balls, not counting extra balls. For this reason, the game has two high score lists: one with buy-ins and one without buy-ins. The player with the highest score without a single buy-in is the player deemed Grand Champion. The game also allows players to enter their initials if they have the highest Casino Run score to date.

It is native to Europe, being most common in Central Europe and rare in much of Southern and Western Europe. This beetle lives under tree bark. It is associated with oaks (Quercus spp.), maples (Acer spp.), and poplars (Populus spp.). It can be found in various habitat types, including forests and urban areas. It is a saproxylic species, often feeding on decomposing wood. It has also been observed eating maggots and the larvae of other beetles. This beetle is on the IUCN Red List as a near-threatened species. It is on many national lists of threatened species in Europe. Forest management practices include the removal of dead wood and dying trees, reducing available habitat and food sources for the beetle.Horak, J., V√°vrov√°, E., & Chobot, K. (2010).

It contains 19 currently recognized species and subspecies. Description Species of Cucujus are of moderate size (6-25mm), greatly dorso-ventrally compressed, and brightly colored, often red or red and black. Additionally, they can distinguished from other members of the family by the head being generally wider than the pronotum with prominent temples, and the elongate, inverted male genitalia with a flagellum. The genus occurs throughout the Holarctic region, with indigenous species in North America, Europe, and Asia. It is most diverse in Asia. Ecology The biology of most species in the genus is poorly known. All life stages live under dead bark, where they apparently are predacious. Larvae also are dorso-ventrally compressed. Cucujus clavipes puniceus, which occurs in western North America, has been the subject of considerable research interest due to its ability to produce natural antifreeze compounds.

The series remains highly popular in primary schools to this day. Parts of the film were shot at Sutton Court, Somerset. The show involves two main characters; Tracy and Edward. They go about their mission to stop a group, led by Miss Hawk, from stealing the treasures of Dark Towers.  Cast  * Juliet Waley as Tracey Brown * Gary Russell as Lord Edward Dark * David Collings as Lord Dark / The Friendly Ghost * Christopher Biggins as Benger * Harry Jones as Bunce * Juliet Hammond (credited as Juliet Hammond-Hill) as Miss Hawk * Peter Mayhew as The Tall Knight  Episodes  Part One (Dark Towers in Danger!): A loner named Tracey Brown and her dog Towser venture into a garden where Tracey meets Lord Edward Dark, who agrees to help her look for Towser. Tracey's search leads her into Dark Towers where she meets Edward's father, Lord Dark. Tracey eventually finds Towser barking at a picture on the wall. The picture comes to life and cries out that the house is in danger, and that the girl (Tracey) will save the house, but Edward and his father do not hear the voice. Part Two (The Man in the Picture): Tracey and Edward encounter two men, Benger and Bunce, and soon become suspicious of the two. When they follow Towser to the Red Bedroom, they meet the Friendly Ghost, who is the man in the picture that spoke. Part Three (The Old Legend): The Friendly Ghost tells Tracey and Edward the legend of Dark Towers, of the Tall Knight, his treasure, and gives them this warning: \\"Beware of Two B's Buzzing Together. Beware of the Bird with the brown feather\\". Part Four (The Clue in the Book): After the Friendly Ghost disappears, a woman named Miss Hawk walks into the Red Bedroom, and offers to help Tracey and Edward look for the treasure. Tracey and Edward find a clue which tells them to \\"Go where old wheels go round\\". Part Five (The Old Coach House): Following the clue, Tracey searches the Old Coach House where she discovers Benger and Bunce are crooks, and overhears their plans. Part Six (The Tall Knight's Folly): Tracey is literally framed by Benger and Bunce (they stuffed a little gold picture into her pocket at the end of the previous episode), and she is sent away by Lord Dark. Edward finds a torn piece of paper in the Old Coach House. He seeks help from the Friendly Ghost, and learns that Benger and Bunce were the \\"two B's\\" the ghost warned him about. Reading the clue, Edward and the Ghost come to the conclusion that the next clue (\\"think of a knight so tall, haunting the end of a wall\\") is at the Tall Knight's Folly at the end of the old wall. Edward goes there, and meets the Tall Knight who demands to know \\"Who comes to the Tall Knight's Folly?\\". Part Seven (The Dark Tree): Edward asks the Tall Knight for his help, but he says he can't help unless Tracey and Towser are there, because the old legend involves a boy, a girl, and a dog, and he vanishes. Luckily, Tracey and Towser are still hanging around, and they meet up with Edward after Towser drags her to the folly. The Tall Knight appears again, and instructs them to \\"go to the old library, and a gold key you will see, inside the inside of the Dark tree\\". While trying to crack the Tall Knight's riddle, Edward realizes that he meant the Dark Family Tree, and they find the final clue, which falls out of the spine of the book. The clue reads: \\"The knight's treasure will rest inside the inside of a studded chest\\". Part Eight (Beware of the Bird!): Edward asks his father if they have a studded chest, and he says there is one in the Old Tower. Miss Hawk overhears. Edward looks at the picture of the Friendly Ghost, and the ghost repeats his warning: \\"Beware of the bird with the brown feather\\", adding, \\"the hawk who hunts treasure\\". Edward now knows Miss Hawk is the bird with the brown feather, and rushes off to find Tracey. They head up to the Old Tower, opening the chest with the key that came with the last clue. It's empty. Benger and Bunce suddenly arrive with Miss Hawk. Bunce puts Tracey in the back of his and Benger's van, and drives off, but the Tall Knight comes to Tracey's rescue. (A similar plot later is also in Part Eight of the later Look and Read story Badger Girl, also by Andrew Davies, where the protagonists are taken away in a van) Part Nine (Who Can Help?): Bunce abandons his van and runs back to Dark Towers. Meanwhile, Miss Hawk has her own ghostly encounter in the Red Bedroom where she is keeping Edward, who now knows Miss Hawk wants the Golden Book of the Tall Knight for herself. The Friendly Ghost appears, and Miss Hawk runs from the Red Bedroom screaming. The baddies all discover the Golden Book of the Tall Knight hidden inside the lid of the studded chest, and the Friendly Ghost tries to summon the Tall Knight. Part Ten (The Last Laugh): Tracey arrives back at Dark Towers as darkness falls, meaning that the Tall Knight will soon appear. She convinces Lord Dark she is innocent, and he calls the police. Miss Hawk snatches the Golden Book of the Tall Knight and splits as all of Dark Towers plunges into darkness. Benger and Bunce go after her. As Tracey, Towser, Edward, and Lord Dark emerge from Dark Towers, the Tall Knight arrives, and scares the bad guys witless. As Benger, Bunce, and Miss Hawk are arrested, and the darkness lifts, Tracey gives Lord Dark the Golden Book of the Tall Knight. The Tall Knight has vanished, but throughout the house are strange sounds like laughter. The ghosts of Dark Towers are having the last laugh.

It is endemic to the Poor Knights Islands off northern New Zealand. D. fallai are commonly called giant wƒìtƒÅ due to their large size. They are one of the largest insects in the world, with a body length measuring up to 73 mm. Their size is an example of island gigantism. They are classified as vulnerable by the IUCN due to their restricted distribution. Description Poor Knights Island group, Northland, New Zealand. Deinacrida fallai was only described as a new species in 1950. It is the second largest wƒìtƒÅ species in the world, with females weighing up to 40g and measuring up to 73mm (2.87 inches) in length. Females are prominently larger than males. D. fallai are light brown in colour with dark brown legs. They have black stripes along the side of their body, as well as a black line marking along the dorsal surface of their body. Their bodies are distinctively broad and they have rounded heads with short mandibles. The Poor Knights giant wƒìtƒÅ primarily feed on kanuka and pohutukawa. Although they rely primarily on vegetation for their nutrition, it is likely that they are omnivorous. In captivity, D. fallai partially ate a male tree wƒìtƒÅ (Hemideina thoracica). Their faces are yellow-brown in colour and are extremely large, relative to its size. Behaviour Adult D. fallai live a relatively nomadic lifestyle, moving from tree to tree periodically. They are nocturnal in their general activities such as ecdysis, feeding, and oviposition, but mate during the day. They occur as solitary individuals and spend their day sitting among tree branches. Although D. fallai are one of the largest/heaviest insect species, they have relatively agile movements and are easily able to jump long distances up and down tree trunks and branches. They can also move quickly if they are disturbed, however, their initial reactions to disturbance is usually to freeze. This in an effective response to predators that rely mostly on visual cues. In general, males are more aggressive than females and males have been observed displaying sexual aggression towards other males during copulation. When D. fallai are scared or annoyed they raise their hind legs vertically over their head. They also quickly move their legs up and down to make a crackling or rasping sound over their stridulatory apparatus for the duration of annoyance. This fearsome display strongly deters any potential predators. Nymphs up to the fifth instar display protective behaviours by burrowing head first into the soil, leaving only their hind tibia and tarsi exposed. Distribution and habitat Deinacrida fallai has a limited distribution and is only known to exist on the rat-free Poor Knights Islands. They are common on the two large islands, Aorangi and Tawhiti Rahi. D. fallai scat/frass has also been found on Archway Island, although no definite specimens have been recorded from here. There have been no other records of its presence on neighboring islands or from the North Island of New Zealand. They are forest dwelling, arboreal insects, spending most of their time on tree trunks and branches at night. During the day they spend their time above ground, perching in foliage or hiding in the lose bark of pohutukawa. They thrive in the undisturbed pohutukawa forests on these islands where they co- exist with low to moderate density populations of tuatara. Although they are arboreal, they do also venture to the ground for oviposition, and have been found under stones in the forest. Life cycle The average lifespan for D. fallai is a little over two years, from egg to adult death. An adult female can live for up to nine months.  Courtship and mating  WƒìtƒÅ studied in captivity displayed no courtship behaviour and sex recognition appeared to be through contact alone. However D. fallai in the wild have been observed displaying male trailing behaviour. This following behaviour indicates that males are attracted to a females pheromones. Mating is not restricted to any particular season and D. fallai held in captivity mated in all months except February and March. D. fallai begin copulation in the morning and continue for several hours throughout the day. They have been observed displaying four different mating positions. The first position begins with either the male backing up under the female, or the female mounting the male, and they both direct their antennae over the back of their bodies. The male applies the distal end of his abdomen to the females sub-genital plate. This hooks their genitalia together and is usually maintained until copulation ends. This mating position causes the male to twist vertically, creating a 45 to 90 degree angle between their bodies and is sometimes assumed instantly at the beginning of copulation. This position is the most common mating position for D. fallai. For the second mating position, the male mounts the female and curls the end of his abdomen under the females abdomen until their genitalia are hooked together. This mating position is rare and has only been observed on a few occasions. The third mating position occurs after the wƒìtƒÅ have been copulating in a 90 degree position for a few hours. The male twists vertically and they assume an end-to-end position with the male lying on his back. Both insects are facing in opposite directions during this position, however this doesn't last long and after about an hour they resume the 90 degree position again. This mating position has only been recorded once. During the fourth mating position the male and female wƒìtƒÅ lay side to side with their legs partially interlocked. Both wƒìtƒÅ have their antennae directed over their backs and their thoracic and abdominal sternites in contact. This mating position has only been recorded once. Each copulation lasts about an hour and the total number of copulations varies between individuals. The male and female don't usually separate during the course of continuous mating. The male produces and transfers a single spermatophore to the underside of the females sub-genital plate during each copulation. Subsequent copulations force the spermatophore ampulla out of the female where it then adheres to the base of her ovipositor. The number of spermatophores transferred to a female range from three to eight during one mating period. They are never eaten by the female. Males are the dominant partner, keeping the passive female in place. If disturbed during copulation the female may wonder off but is quickly found by the male to re- mate.  Oviposition and eggs  Large female D. fallai. Note the ovipositor at the rear end. Females can lay eggs throughout their life at any time of the year, provided the ambient temperature is higher than 10¬∞C. They lay the eggs into soil during the night by standing on the tip of their legs and thrusting the ovipositor into the soil at a right angle to the body. Eggs are laid closely together as singles or in small groups of no more than five. They can produce anywhere between 200 and 300 egg during their lives, however the number of eggs that are laid is largely dependent on whether the conditions are favorable or not. A limited number of eggs are fertilized at each copulation and the average number of eggs laid during one oviposition time is 27 to 39. Eggs are bright yellow in the ovaries and medium brown during oviposition. They are oval in shape and approximately 2.5mm wide and 7mm long when first laid, growing to 3mm by 8mm during incubation. The surface structure of their eggs is classified by fine reticulated patterns of chorionic ridges. Eggs take approximately five months (147 days) to hatch.  Growth  During growth, D. fallai goes through 10 nymphal stages (9 nymphal instars). The ovipositor becomes visible at the third instar and size differences between the sexes is noticeable at the sixth instar. There is considerable variation in the time that each individual spends at each nymphal instar, ranging from 3 to 13 weeks. Nymphs that hatch in summer or spring will become adults 11 to 13 months later. In males, the gonads mature over a few weeks after the final ecdysis and their weight also steadily increases. Female weight increases as a result of mating stimulating egg maturation. Mating occurs once females reach at least 30g. Sound production D. fallai use an abdomino-femoral mechanism to produce sound by rubbing their hind legs against the tergites on their abdomen. Their specific type of mechanism is called Tergo-tergal stridulatory mechanism. They have one large crescent shaped file ridge on their second tergite plate, as well as many tiny spiny pegs on the ventro-posterior portion of their tergite and several additional blunt pegs that are dorsally faced. The leading edge of the convex crescent ridge is separated by a longitudinal groove that forms two lips. On their femur they have raised, elongated pegs that are grooved to the middle of their femur and point radially away from the femur base. These pegs are also double lipped, separated by a longitudinal groove. Because the femur pegs are arranged in a radial fashion, they will rub laterally against the ridges on the tergite as the wƒìtƒÅ moves its legs past its abdomen. When the wƒìtƒÅ moves its back legs up and down against this stridulatory apparatus it creates a crackling or rasping sound that strongly deters potential predators. D. fallai also use an abdominal stridulatory apparatus in which the membrane between the second and third abdominal tergites contains two small groups of lateral spines. When the wƒìtƒÅ is annoyed, abdominal segment contractions cause the spines to rub together, producing a hissing sound. Sound production is restricted to defense behaviour.  Phylogenetics  Deinacrida fallai form a monophyletic clade with two other northern arboreal wƒìtƒÅ species: D. heteracantha and D. mahoenui. This is from phylogenetic analysis of their genetic and morphological characters. Males have 21 chromosomes, females 22 but their genome is relatively large, measuring 8.5Gbp for males and 11Gbp for females. The sex difference is due to male wƒìtƒÅ having a single X chromosome, while females have a pair of large X chromosomes.  Threats  Swamp Harrier (Circus approximans). A day time predator of D. fallai. There is currently no evidence of distribution or abundance decline, however they are preyed upon by a wide range of species. Indigenous predators include lizards, birds and tuataras. Remains of D. fallai have been found in the Harrier (Circus approximans),McCallum, J. (1981). Birds of Tawhiti Rahi Island, Poor Knights Group, Northland, New Zealand. Tane 27:59‚Äì66. which is diurnal, indicating that D. fallai are accessible during the day and the harrier hawk is a main daytime predator. Although these predators do not seem to threaten the populations, special care must be taken to ensure any future introduction of insectivorous animals do not negatively impact the viability of D. fallai populations.  Conservation  Deinacrida fallai are one of many giant wƒìtƒÅ species that are protected under the Seventh Schedule of the 1953 Wildlife Act. They are listed as 'medium term recovery work' under the Department of Conservation's threatened wƒìtƒÅ recovery plan. They are currently a category C species under the Molloy and Davis (1994) classification system, and a category VU D2 under the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. There is currently a pest contingency plan required for the Poor Knights Island (especially for rodents), to maintain the security of the island. Accidental introduction of rodents to the Poor Knights Islands would endanger the entire species by gravely reducing or eradicating D. fallai. Investigation is required in order to assess feasibility of the potential increase of D. fallai populations by introducing this species to other locations. D. fallai have been successfully bred in captivity at the Wellington Zoo in New Zealand and have been used there to educate the public.

It is endemic to New Zealand, where it survived only on Little Barrier Island, although it has been translocated to some other predator-free island conservation areas. This very large flightless wƒìtƒÅ mainly feeds at night, but is also active during the day, when it can be found above ground in vegetation. It has been classified as vulnerable by the IUCN due to ongoing population declines and restricted distribution.  Description  D. heteracantha can weigh up to 70 g, but on average weighs between 9‚Äì35 g. Average body length is around 75 mm (3 inches).Nasrecki, P. 2013. Grasshoppers and their relatives. Elsevier Inc. 3: 247-264.Field, L.H. 2001. The Biology of Wetas, King Crickets and their Allies. New York: CABI Publishing. It is a sexually dimorphic species, with the females being much larger than the males. These large wƒìtƒÅ have a broad body and a round head, along with short mandibles. Compared to other cricket species wƒìtƒÅ have relatively short antennae, but can deliver a strong kick with their hind legs. They are generally wingless. The species is mainly herbivorous and feeds on forest foliage.  Habitat  Little Barrier Island D. heteracantha are arboreal forest insect dwellers found on Little Barrier Island which lies off the coast of New Zealand. This island is only in size. They once occupied forests in northern New Zealand including Northland and Auckland. Their habitat range on Little Barrier Island is from second-growth forests located on the lower slopes of the island to the mid-level tall kauri forest. The second-growth forest is dominated by silverfern, nikau palm, mahoe, and kohekohe.  Behaviour  As adults these giant wƒìtƒÅ live a nomadic lifestyle. This type of lifestyle means that these wƒìtƒÅ do not live in the same place, but move to a new location periodically.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2015. Nomadism. Accessed November 20, 2015 from Link text They live a solitary lifestyle and most of their activity is done at night (i.e. feeding and moving). They can be found above ground level under loose bark or in the cavities of mahoe and pohutukawa trees. During the day and night males tend to move farther than the females. The male would follow the female by staying back about 25 cm from her; this is observed during the night time.  Life cycle and reproduction  The life cycle of D. heteracantha is not tied to the seasons. They can live for up to two years. Eggs are laid in the summer months from October to December. The eggs will then hatch in March and April of the following year. D. heteracantha mate most months out of the year except for the winter months from June‚ÄìAugust. Copulation will start in the morning and continue throughout the day. During copulation the spermatophore from the male is inserted into the female's subgenital plate. Females lay their eggs at night into moist soil. Each egg is laid singly or in groups of five in area that is about 15 cm2 and about 2‚Äì3 cm deep. Females only produce an indefinite amount of eggs. Females lay eggs for the rest of their lives, but only a limited number of them are fertilised during each copulation. The eggs incubate on average for 125 days and only 36% of the eggs survive to hatch.Richards, A.O. 1973. A comparative study of the biology of the giant wetas Deinacrida heteracantha and D. fallai (Orthoptera: Henicidae) from New Zealand. Journal of Zoology 169: 195-236 After the eggs hatch there are ten instars that they go through until death. In females the ovipositor becomes visible at the third instar. At the sixth instar the difference between male and female sexes becomes obvious. Each instar lasts on average between five and six weeks. D. heteracantha has an extra instar compared to other species in its genus, this extra instar is what makes the nymphal period longer and their overall body size larger. D. heteracantha show no courtship rituals. No stridulatory signals have been observed; sex recognition is done by contact only.  Sound generation  D. heteracantha possesses a stridulatory apparatus. This apparatus is the sound producing organ based on the mechanism of rubbing one body part against another body part. There is a great variety in these structures seen in Orthoptera. Certain behaviours are associated with the sounds being produced by the Orthoptera.Field, L.H. 1993. Structure and evolution of stridulatory mechanisms in New Zealand Wetas (Orthoptera: Stenopelmatidae). International Journal of Insect Morphology and Embryology (22): 163-183. In the case of D. heteracantha there is a wide variation in the gross morphology of their stridulatory structures. Their stridulation plays a role in interspecific defense mechanisms. They use a femoro-abdominal mechanism to produce sound. This mechanism has two parts to it, a femoral peg and an abdominal ridge. The femoral pegs are an elongated and raised structure. There are two abdominal ridges present on D. heteracantha, a major and minor ridge. The major ridge is longer and higher than the minor ridge. The minor ridge does not normally come in contact with the femoral pegs. D. heteracantha has a wide-band linear magnitude spectra (kHz) that they produce for defensive sounds. They have a major peak at 20 kHz and a minor peak around 40‚Äì50 kHz. The shape of their stridulatory mechanism is why they can produce these frequency ranges.Field, L.H. 1981. Stridulatory structures and acoustic spectra of seven species of New Zealand wetas (Orthoptera: Stenopelmatidae). International Journal of Insect Morphology and Embryology (11): 39-51.  Threats  Polynesian rat (kiore) While D. heteracantha were commonly seen on Little Barrier Island in the 1950s, numbers have declined strongly since then. Predation rather than habitat destruction is regarded as the main cause for this.Gibbs, G. and M., McIntyre. 1997. Abundance and future options for wetapunga on Little Barrier Island. Science for Conservation 48: 1-25. . Feral cats were present on the island until they were completely eradicated in the 1980s, and may have fed on vulnerable juvenile D. heteracantha. Polynesian rats (Rattus exulans), \\"kiore\\" in MƒÅori language, are one of the top predators of D. heteracantha, preying mostly on juveniles wƒìtƒÅs which they kill during the night. An increase of the Polynesian rat population occurred after the feral cats were eradicated. As saddlebacks prey on the wƒìtƒÅ during the day, D. heteracantha are thus under constant predation pressure. There is evidence suggesting that these rats have a negative impact on the population of these wƒìtƒÅ, as is commonly the case with invasive rodents.St. Clair, J.J.H. 2011. The impacts of invasive rodents on island invertebrates. Biological Conservation (144): 68-81. The removal of the kiore in 2004 was a success. The population size grew back each year and a four-fold increase was reported six years after the removal.Green, C. J, G.W, Gibbs, and P.A, Barrett. (2011). Wetapunga (Deinacrida heteracantha) population changes following Pacific rat (Rattus exulans) eradication on Little barrier Island. IUCN, Gland, Switzerland: 305-308. Other predators include tuatara, geckos and the North Island brown kiwi during the night, and kingfishers and the long-tailed cuckoo by day. Captive breeding and release One of 150 D. heteracantha released on Tiritiri Matangi Island on 1 May 2014 D. heteracantha is currently classified as vulnerable by the IUCN. Since 2008 the Department of Conservation has been involved in a captive breeding and release programme to mitigate the risk of having the entire population resident on one island. Individuals captured on Hauturu/Little Barrier Island have been successfully bred in captivity at Butterfly Creek and Auckland Zoo. The descendants have been released onto Motuora and Tiritiri Matangi Islands. Additionally adults from Hauturu/Little Barrier Island have been transferred directly to Motuora. It is hoped that the released D. heteracantha will eventually build up self-sustaining populations on these additional predator free islands. In 2016 adult female has been observed on Tiritiri Matangi Island in the area where the first population was released. She can only be a descendant of the initial translocated population of 25 individuals released in 2011. Individuals translocated onto Tiritiri Matangi island in 2014 have been observed mating.

Downloaded on 21 February 2016. or Kaikoura giant wƒìtƒÅ.Threatened Weta Recovery Plan. New Zealand Department of Conservation. December 1998. It was first described in 1894 from a male individual then rediscovered in 1966 by Dr J.C. Watt at Lake Sedgemore in Upper Wairau. It is endemic to New Zealand, where it can be found in the northern half of the South Island. This is a small to medium-sized robust wƒìtƒÅ. It is easily confused with Deinacrida rugosa. Due to the rarity of this weta, there is still much to be learnt. Description Deinacrida parva have a rounded brown body. The females are larger than the males in this species of wƒìtƒÅ, but the males have long legs suggesting scramble competition for mates. The females have a large spike on the end of their body, this spike is called an ovipositor and is used for laying eggs. The Kaikoura giant wƒìtƒÅ can grow up to around 100mm in size and weigh up to 14.5 grams. They have a life span of roughly two years. This wƒìtƒÅ, although very similar in apparence, is smaller in size than D. rugosa and is a brown colour with darker colouring under the abdomen. Red or pink coloration can also be present on the boarder of the thoracic shield. A major identification of the Kaikoura WƒìtƒÅ is by counting the six spines present on the lower hind leg. The taxonomic status of D.parva and D. rugosa were investigated. These two are species are morphologically similar and phylogenetically sister species. Habitat and distribution Deinacrida parva are found in many different terrestrial environments but most commonly under large logs on river flats and scrub areas close to the edges of the forests. Large proportions of individuals are found under Matai logs. Their preference for living close to water ways has resulted in the drowning of some individuals, although this might be linked to infection by internal parasites. D. parva are found between 150 to 1500m above sea level from South Marlborough to Hanmer Springs. These weta are considered subalpine specialists. They are most common surrounding Hapuku and Kowhai river close to Kaikoura (hence the name of these wƒìtƒÅ). It is suspected they now occupy less than 10% of their former range. Diet Deinacrida parva are herbivorous and feed mainly on the leaves of trees and shrubs. Females of this species have been known to eat carcasses of dead or dying insects for extra protein during breeding season for egg development. Behaviour This weta, like many of the other weta in New Zealand, is nocturnal. D. parva are able to produce sounds by rubbing tergite spines and hair sensilla together (located on their abdominal plates). The sounds are normally produced during contraction of the abdomen and often in time with a defensive leg kick as a warning. This is called the tergo-tergal mechanism. The sounds produced are a soft hiss and often fall within ultrasonic frequencies. Using hair sensilla for sound production is a rare occurrence in arthropods and a potential explanation for why it has occurred in this species is that it has evolved under predation pressure by the endemic short-tailed bat in New Zealand. There are no current evidence that the sounds produced are for intraspecific communication but it has not been researched extensively. Breeding D. parva have been breed in captivity. But due to wƒìtƒÅ being captured at different ages and conditions, breeding pairs were hard to establish. Young wƒìtƒÅ come to sexual maturity successfully in captivity but some fail to lay eggs. Females lay eggs in the soil with an ovipositor. Conservation Populations in some parts have declined to a few individuals. Many of the die-offs have been in the large populations close to Kaikoura. Even though there has been a die off the population is considered to be stable. A major reason for decline is likely due to habitat clearance and predation by pests. The changes in the natural habitat of D. parva has affected the chances of future survival in many of the smaller recorded populations. Many of their original habitats have been cleared for pasture. The die-offs could be associated with the Gordian worm parasite. But the full impact of the parasite is unknown and still requires further research. D. parva that become hosts for the Gordian worm parasite have been shown to have lowered reproductive capabilities. Further population surveys and full distribution research needs to be conducted for further information. Although that has been difficult due to low population numbers, thick vegetation and uneven grounds. Searching for these weta in the fallen logs (where they are most likely to be found) also damages and degrades the logs quicker and leaves less available habitats for them. It has been proposed that they should be bred and then released on predator-free islands. Mainland habitat management has also been suggested as a conservation plan.

Description The Cook Strait giant weta is one of the largest insects in the world, reaching up to long.Cook Strait giant weta (Deinacrida rugosa). Arkive. The brownish-yellow body is bulky and heavily armoured, with the upper surface covered by a series of thickened, overlapping plates, which have black markings. Relative to the size of the head, the jaws are large, and the elongated hind legs have five or six large spines, and can be raised above the head in defence. The female is significantly larger than the male, and both sexes lack wings.Deinacrida rugosa New Zealand Department of Conservation (November, 2008) Distribution and habitat The Cook Strait giant weta is found only in New Zealand, on the islands of the North, South and Middle Trio, Stephens, Maud, Matiu/Somes and Mana. In 2007, this species was reintroduced to mainland New Zealand, where it had been extinct for over 100 years, and is now found in Zealandia Wildlife Sanctuary in the North Island.Cook Strait giant weta. Karori Sanctuary Trust. It is found in open grassland, shrubland and forest margins. Biology The Cook Strait giant weta is nocturnal and feeds on the aerial parts of plants. During the day it conceals itself amongst grass in a temporary refuge that it makes in the soil surface, or under dead leaves, bark or stones. It emerges just after dusk, foraging on the ground or on low-growing bushes and shrubs, where it particularly favours tauhinu flowers (Cassinia leptophylla). Owing to its solitary and nomadic lifestyle, the Cook Strait giant weta's reproduction relies upon the male locating a receptive female. This search is facilitated by the strong scent produced by the weta's body and by its faecal pellets, and can involve the male travelling over 250 metres in a single night. Once located, the male places a leg over the female's body and maintains contact until a daytime refuge is found. Here, mating occurs throughout the day and, if the weather is cool and wet, possibly throughout the night as well. The female subsequently lays around 200 eggs in the soil and dies. The eggs develop for a few months and hatch in the spring, with the juvenile wetas emerging fully developed. It takes most of the Cook Strait giant weta's two- year lifespan to reach the full adult size, with growth taking place in a series of about nine moults over a 12- to 18-month period.  Threats  A number of animals prey on the Cook Strait giant weta, including birds and reptiles such as the tuatara. As a defence against predators the Cook Strait giant weta will raise its spiked legs over its head and wave them up and down while making a hissing sound by rapidly rubbing together the overlapping plates on its upper body.Field, L.H. (2001) The Biology of Wetas, King Crickets and Their Allies. CABI Publishing, Wallingford. Historically, the Cook Strait giant weta was found on mainland New Zealand as well as many off- shore islands, but the introduction of mammalian predators such as the black rat (Rattus rattus), and the clearance of much of its habitat, led to the contraction of its range to just a few small, \\"rat-free\\" islands in the Cook Strait. A combination of its ground-dwelling lifestyle, large size, and strong scent make it particularly vulnerable to predation, and therefore, accidental introductions of mammalian predators to the offshore islands could be catastrophic for its survival.  Conservation  Introductions of the Cook Strait giant weta to Mana Island in 1976, Matiu / Somes Island in 1996, and, most recently, Zealandia Wildlife Sanctuary in the North Island in 2007 have helped to greatly expand this vulnerable species‚Äô range. In addition, on Mana Island, the removal of cattle and eradication of mice has dramatically increased Cook Strait giant weta abundance. With the success of these introductions, the New Zealand Department of Conservation plans to continue to introduce the Cook Strait giant weta to new island habitats, while ensuring that its existing island habitats remain protected against the threat of predator invasion. The Matiu-Somes Island transfer was undertaken in 1996 with two separate translocations taking place. In total 62 individual weta were released and were sourced from Mana Island. Surveys of the Cook Strait giant weta were undertaken on Matiu-Somes Island in 2013 and 2015. The species has been introduced to Zealandia Wildlife Sanctuary. By using a specially designed fence to exclude mammalian predators, the sanctuary hopes to re-establish an environment similar to that which existed on New Zealand before the arrival of humans, where species such as the Cook Strait giant weta can thrive once more. The Cook Strait giant weta was assessed by the Department of Conservation as \\"At Risk: Relict\\", with a stable but small population.

He was also a county judge and member of the Utah Territorial Legislture. Holbrook was born in what was then Florence, New York. Where he was born was later separated into the town of Annsville, New York. His father Moses Holbrook had moved to New York from Massachusetts. Holbrook's father died when he was seven-years-old, and he then moved to Massachusetts with his grandfather. This was primarily to give him better access to schools. When he was 19 he returned to Annisville. Due to his mother having remarried he however returned to Massachusetts after a few weeks. He worked as a farm laborer in his grandfather's household for the next two years and then moved to Nassau, New York where he found work as a farm laborer. In the winter of 1827-1828 Holbrook was a school teacher in Annisville for a three-month term. He then returned to Sturbridge, Massachusetts and worked for a farmer in the general vicinity of where his grandfather lived for a time. In December 1828 he began to work in the lead mines of Sturbridge. He was injured while mining and then returned to farm work, this time for Hezekiah Allen. Allen also had hired a young woman, Nancy Lampson, to help his wife in cheese making, spinning and other household chores. Holbrook fell in love with her, went west to Genesee County, New York where his mother had moved to and bought a farm in Wethersfield, New York (which would be split off into Wyoming County, New York in 1841). He then returned to Massachusetts and married Lampson. He became a farmer in Wethersfield in 1830. In 1832 Holbrook first encountered Mormons. The first messengers of that Church he encountered were Evan Greene, a son of John P. Greene, and Lorenzo D. Young, Evan Greene's uncle. They did not have a copy of the Book of Mormon, which Holbrook sought, but he was eventually able to get one from his cousin Mary Ann Angel. He was baptized by Leonard Rich in January 1833. In April 1833 Holbrook served a mission traveling through parts of New York and then onto Connecticut, RHode Island and Massachusetts with his cousin Truman O. Angell. While on this mission they organized a branch in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1834 Holbrook agreed to join Zion's Camp. He sold his farm in Wethersfield, and relocated his family to Kirtland, and then left them there as he headed west to Missouri. After the completion of Zion's Camp, he took up farming in Clay County, Missouri and then served a mission to eastern Missouri and the region around Quincy, Illinois. His wife and children had come to Missouri sometime late in 1834. In 1837 Holbrook moved to Caldwell County, Missouri where he settled along Plum Creek about 3 miles west of Far West, Missouri. Besides farming he also worked as a builder there, building an office for Bishop Edward Partridge and also building a schoolhouse as well as several homes. He was also a lieutenant in the county militia. After the Mormons were driven from Missouri, Holbrook settled for a time in Quincy, Illinois where he worked at making fence rails. He then was assigned by Joseph Smith to buy corn from the country to the north and east of Quincy, process it, and then distribute it to the Mormon refugees fleeing Missouri. He then served as a counselor in the presidency of the LDS branch at Ramus (now Webster, Illinois. Holbrook organized a company of the Nauvoo Legion in Ramus. In the summer of 1842 at the urging of Anson Call Holbrook moved to Nauvoo, Illinois shortly after which his wife died. A few months later he married Hannah Flint. She ran a school out of their house in Nauvoo. Holbrook came to Utah in Brigham Young's company of 1848. Holbrook moved to Bountiful in 1850. From 1851-1859 he served as a judge in Davis County, Utah. He was a member of the Utah Territorial Legislture in 1857 and 1859.Joseph Smith Papers Project bio of Holbrook He died in Bountiful, Utah Territory.Early Latter-day Saints Database: Joseph Holbrook,

It may be to protect the quantity of the water itself or for any issues relating to the water body as a whole. New Zealand In New Zealand, a Water Conservation Order is used to protect the natural, cultural and recreational values of any water body.Part 9 of the Resource Management Act 1991 Water Conservation Orders came about as a result of lobbying by a group of stakeholders in the late seventies. At that time rivers were managed through the Water & Soil Conservation Act, which was administered by an appointed statutory body (NWASCA) serviced by the Ministry of Works. The engineers of the Ministry of Works argued that there was no need to legislate further as the Act contained provision for setting Minimum Flows. There are currently 15 separate Water Conservation Orders: *Ahuriri River *Buller River *Grey River *Kawarau River *Lake Wairarapa *Manganui o te Ao River *Mataura River *Mohaka River *Motueka River *Motu River *Oreti River *Rakaia River *Rangitata River *Rangitikei River *Te Waihora Lake Ellesmere A water conservation order has been proposed for the Hurunui River in the South Island. Irrigation New Zealand, the national body representing agricultural irrigators and the irrigation industry, opposes water conservation orders.

Description One of the largest representatives of the predaceous diving beetles of the genus Dytiscus, D. latissimus can reach a length around . This beetle is similar in structure to the better-known and widespread D. marginalis, but it is clearly larger and especially wider. The species is usually easy to recognize by the extensions on both sides of the shield. The elytra and the pronotum are dark brown with yellow sides. The head is black, while the legs are yellow. The male's wing cases are shiny, while those of the female are finely grooved. This voracious predator hunts a wide variety of prey, including other insects, tadpoles, and small fish. Before they dive, they collect air bubbles in their wing cases which go through the spiracles. Distribution This species can be found in northern and central European countries. The species is listed on Annex II and Annex IV of the European Union Habitats Directive; the latter gives it strict protection within the EU member countries. Habitat It is an aquatic species and it inhabits in dense vegetation, mainly of Carex and Equisetum, at the edges of lakes or in nonflowing waters and deep ponds.

Downloaded on 23 January 2016. This slender malachite is 47‚Äì55 mm long with a wingspan of 57‚Äì61 mm. Males and females are similar; the thorax and abdomen are metallic-green to bronze, with yellow antehumeral stripes on the thorax. Mature males, however, have a bright pruinose-blue colouring on the collar, between the wings and on the last two segments of the abdomen. Both sexes can be distinguished from malachites of the genus Chlorolestes by their wing venation. This damselfly lives in shady forest habitat on fern-lined streambanks. Loss of this natural forest habitat is a potential threat to the species, but populations are currently thought to be stable.

It is commonly known as the marbled malachite.  Description  This large damselfly earns its common name from its dark metallic, cryptic colouration, which perfectly camouflages it against the mottled, lichen-covered boulders upon which it habitually sits. Its body is primarily black, but features brown markings along its long, slender abdomen, it is particularly at the joints between segments, and is bluish, slate-grey colouring at the tip.  Geographical range  The marbled malachite is endemic to South Africa. It is only known from protected areas within the Cape Fold Mountains of the Western Cape.  Habitat  Its natural habitat is rivers. It is also found along clear, shallow streams with an abundance of large, lichen-covered boulders. Two populations of marbled malachites exist at high elevation locations over 1,000 metres above sea level, while a third population is at 400 metres above sea level.  Biology  There is virtually nothing known about the marbled malachite‚Äôs reproductive biology, life history patterns or feeding behaviour.  Threats  Marbled malachites were probably never widespread or abundant, but early records nevertheless reveal that it was once found at many more localities than it is today. Despite its historical declines, however, the current population of this species appears to be stable, both in range and size, and habitat destruction, mostly for plantation forestry, has largely subsided. Even so, this damselfly species remains vulnerable to several threats that have the potential to impact dramatically on such small and specialized populations. Alien invasive trees, which shade out the habitat, are considered one of the most pervasive and significant threats facing specialized, endemic South African dragonflies and damselflies. Introduced trout pose a serious threat to endemic dragonflies and damselflies through predation.  Conversation  The marbled malachite occurs within protected areas. A massive national rehabilitation programme (Working with Water Programme) began in 1995 with the aim of eradicating invasive alien plants in South Africa. The programme has been a fantastic success story, with other dragonflies and damselflies like Pseudagrion newtoni that were presumed to be extinct being rediscovered along river stretches where invasive alien trees were removed and the natural vegetation reestablished. This programme has also greatly benefited the marbled malachite, but it is imperative that there is no further encroachment of plantation forestry. It is important that populations are regularly monitored to make sure that they are remaining stable. However, for the time being, this enigmatic damselfly is thought relatively safe from the threat of extinction.

He is portrayed by Douglas Smith. Ben is the second child and oldest son of Bill Henrickson with his first and once legal wife, Barbara Henrickson. As of \\"The Lost Boys\\", he is 17 years old. He becomes a priesthood holder in season 2. Biography Like most teenagers, Ben is full of raging hormones, which he struggles to control in keeping with the views on sexuality in his religion; he desires to be chaste but finds little support for this desire among his friends or from his older girlfriend, Brynn. Ben and Brynn were steadily dating, but she felt that the Mormon views on chastity and sexuality amounted to brainwashing and saw no reason to reserve sexual relations for marriage. This led to conflict between her and Ben until she eventually made it known to him that she would have nothing to do with him unless he would be willing to sleep with her. After struggling for a few weeks without her, Ben came to Brynn's house and acceded to her demand, initiating a sexual relationship that eventually becomes public to the entire Henrickson clan. He proposes marriage to her, both to satisfy his own conscience and to render their relationship acceptable; when his parents refuse to accept the union, he says that if his marriage to Brynn doesn't work out, he can take on a second wife. This disturbs Barb, who doesn't want to see Ben become a polygamist, and she invites Brynn over, telling her the advantages and disadvantages of a polygamous relationship. Brynn, who was not told about Ben's plans of taking more wives after her, breaks up with Ben. Afterward, Bill, happy about his son's interest in polygamy, anoints him priesthood holder. He is very close to his father's young third wife Margene Heffman. Ben is especially close to Margene because of their closeness in age, which makes her more of an older sister than a mother to him. Telling him that she wishes she had waited for marriage and had known, as he does, that sex is \\"a sacred thing,\\" she encourages him in his struggle to remain pure rather than only castigating him when he fails. Recently, however, it is implied that the friendship may have turned into a one-sided crush. His mother Barb worries how close the two are after she finds out Ben prefers sleeping on Margene's couch rather than his own bedroom. Later, Ben meets Margene's ex-boyfriend and he makes several lewd comments about her, Ben violently pushes him to the ground, and some days later, angrily confronts Margene about her previous sexual exploits. It is revealed that while Bill may be comfortable with Margene's previous relationships, Ben isn't, possibly due both to his own unresolved pangs of conscience over his continuing relationship with Brynn and to his own romantic feelings for Margene. After it becomes clear that Barb wants to discourage Ben from polygamy, he starts dating twin girls from the compound in season two to the annoyance of his older sister who, like their mother, is concerned that Ben may one day end up like his father, a polygamist. In season four Margene kisses him, causing Ben and Bill to mutually agree to leave at this time. However, it seems by the end of the season he has reconciled with his father and is allowed back in the House. In season 5 he begins an unexpected romance with Heather Tuttle. Though they break up and reunite on at least two occasions, a flash forward in the series finale reveals that they eventually marry.

Sportsnet World primarily airs Rugby Union and Rugby league. History The channel was launched as Setanta Sports, in partnership with Ireland-based Setanta Sports, on August 10, 2007 in time for the 2007‚Äì08 Premier League season, as a dedicated channel within Rogers' sports pay-per-view service Sportsnet PPV. Although operating under a pay-per-view licence, Setanta acted as a pay television service, with a 24-hour commercial-free schedule, rather than a pay-per-view service where customers are prompted to pay a price for each individual event. Original Setanta Sports logo, used from 2007 to 2011. Rogers later applied to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for a category 2 digital licence which was approved on July 15, 2008 under the name Sportsnet 2.ARCHIVED - Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2008-142. Crtc.gc.ca (2008-07-15). Retrieved on 2013-12-23. In mid-2009, Rogers swapped licences for Setanta Sports, from using the pay-per-view licence to the category 2 digital licence, without interrupting service; at which point, the Irish-based Setanta Sports company gained a 33.33% interest in the Rogers subsidiary that owns 80% of the channel, as well as a 20% interest in the channel itself. In July 2011, Rogers announced that Setanta Sports would be rebranded as part of the Sportsnet family of networks on October 3, 2011, becoming Sportsnet World. The change was intended to allow the channel to be cross-promoted through other Sportsnet properties; the change came alongside a larger, overall rebranding of the Rogers Sportsnet group of channels launched the same day. In preparation for the relaunch, Setanta Sports' minority stake in the channel was sold to another company, MLM Management, and the rights to Setanta programming were maintained by the channel. Despite being branded as a Sportsnet service, it remained a premium channel separate from the Sportsnet regional networks and Sportsnet One. MLM Management's interest in the channel was sold to Rogers in early 2012, giving Rogers 100% interest in the service.CRTC ownership chart Retrieved on 2012-08-12 Programming Sportsnet World features live and recorded events from the following leagues and competitions: Rugby League * Australia: National Rugby League * United Kingdom: Super League  Rugby Union  * England: Premiership Rugby  Soccer  * England: FA Cup, FA Community Shield (until 2021) * Germany:Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal, DFL-Supercup (2015‚Äìpresent) Sportsnet World HD Original Setanta Sports HD logo, used from 2010 to 2011.

The energy lost in dissipating the proton gradient via UCPs is not used to do biochemical work. Instead, heat is generated. This is what links UCP to thermogenesis. However, not all kinds of UCPs are related to thermogenesis. Although UCP2 and UCP3 are closely related to UCP1, UCP2 and UCP3 do not affect thermoregulatory abilities of vertebrates. UCPs are positioned in the same membrane as the ATP synthase, which is also a proton channel. The two proteins thus work in parallel with one generating heat and the other generating ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate, the last step in oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria respiration is coupled to ATP synthesis (ADP phosphorylation) but is regulated by UCPs. Uncoupling proteins play a role in normal physiology, as in cold exposure or hibernation, because the energy is used to generate heat (see thermogenesis) instead of producing ATP. Some plants species use the heat generated by uncoupling proteins for special purposes. Skunk cabbage, for example, keeps the temperature of its spikes as much as 20¬∞ higher than the environment, spreading odor and attracting insects that fertilize the flowers. However, other substances, such as 2,4-dinitrophenol and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone, also serve the same uncoupling function. Salicylic acid is also an uncoupling agent (chiefly in plants) and will decrease production of ATP and increase body temperature if taken in extreme excess. Uncoupling proteins are increased by thyroid hormone, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and leptin.  History  Scientists observed the thermogenic activity in brown adipose tissue, which eventually led to the discovery of UCP1, initially known as \\"Uncoupling Protein\\". The brown tissue revealed elevated levels of mitochondria respiration and another respiration not coupled to ATP synthesis, which symbolized strong thermogenic activity. UCP1 was the protein discovered responsible for activating a proton pathway that was not coupled to ADP phosphorylation (ordinarily done through ATP Synthase).  In mammals  There are five UCP homologs known in mammals. While each of these performs unique functions, certain functions are performed by several of the homologs. The homologs are as follows: *UCP1, also known as thermogenin *UCP2, also known as SLC25A8 *UCP3, also known as SLC25A9 *UCP4, also known as SLC25A27 *UCP5, also known as SLC25A14  Maintaining body temperature  The first uncoupling protein discovered, UCP1, was discovered in the brown adipose tissues of hibernators and small rodents, which provide non-shivering heat to these animals. These brown adipose tissues are essential to maintaining the body temperature of small rodents, and studies with (UCP1)-knockout mice show that these tissues do not function correctly without functioning uncoupling proteins. In fact, these studies revealed that cold- acclimation is not possible for these knockout mice, indicating that UCP1 is an essential driver of heat production in these brown adipose tissues. Elsewhere in the body, uncoupling protein activities are known to affect the temperature in micro-environments. This is believed to affect other proteins' activity in these regions, though work is still required to determine the true consequences of uncoupling-induced temperature gradients within cells.  Role in ATP concentrations  The effect of UCP2 and UCP3 on ATP concentrations varies depending on cell type. For example, pancreatic beta cells experience a decrease in ATP concentration with increased activity of UCP2. This is associated with cell degeneration, decreased insulin secretion, and type II diabetes. Conversely, UCP2 in hippocampus cells and UCP3 in muscle cells stimulate production of mitochondria. The larger number of mitochondria increases the combined concentration of ADP and ATP, actually resulting in a net increase in ATP concentration when these uncoupling proteins become coupled (i.e. the mechanism to allow proton leaking is inhibited).  Maintaining concentration of reactive oxygen species  The entire list of functions of UCP2 and UCP3 is not known. However, studies indicate that these proteins are involved in a negative-feedback loop limiting the concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Current scientific consensus states that UCP2 and UCP3 perform proton transportation only when activation species are present. Among these activators are fatty acids, ROS, and certain ROS byproducts that are also reactive. Therefore, higher levels of ROS directly and indirectly cause increased activity of UCP2 and UCP3. This, in turn, increases proton leak from the mitochondria, lowering the proton-motive force across mitochondrial membranes, activating the electron transport chain. Limiting the proton motive force through this process results in a negative feedback loop that limits ROS production. Especially, UCP2 decreases the transmembrane potential of mitochondria, thus decreasing the production of ROS. Thus, cancer cells may increase the production of UCP2 in mitochondria. This theory is supported by independent studies which show increased ROS production in both UCP2 and UCP3 knockout mice. This process is important to human health, as high-concentrations of ROS are believed to be involved in the development of degenerative diseases.  Functions in neurons  By detecting the associated mRNA, UCP2, UCP4, and UCP5 were shown to reside in neurons throughout the human central nervous system. These proteins play key roles in neuronal function. While many study findings remain controversial, several findings are widely accepted. For example, UCP's alter the free calcium concentrations in the neuron. Mitochondria are a major site of calcium storage in neurons, and the storage capacity increases with potential across mitochondrial membranes. Therefore, when the uncoupling proteins reduce potential across these membranes, calcium ions are released to the surrounding environment in the neuron. Due to the high concentrations of mitochondria near axon terminals, this implies UCP's play a role in regulating calcium concentrations in this region. Considering calcium ions play a large role in neurotransmission, scientists predict that these UCP's directly affect neurotransmission. As discussed above, neurons in the hippocampus experience increased concentrations of ATP in the presence of these uncoupling proteins. This leads scientists to hypothesize that UCP's improve synaptic plasticity and transmission.This diagram shows the location of UCP1 with respect to the electron transport chain.

The Blair Musical is a satirical comedy musical written in 2007 by Chris Bush, director of the White Rose Theatre, with music composed by Ian McCluskey. TONY! follows the premiership of former British prime minister Tony Blair from his landslide election in 1997 to his resignation ten years later. It is told to the audience by Blair himself, in the form of an interplay of spotlit monologues and musical flashbacks to various moments in the former prime minister's career. The musical focuses primarily on Blair's relationships with the key characters in his life, rather than the politics, including his Chancellor and successor as Prime Minister Gordon Brown and wife Cherie Booth. It is a musically eclectic production, featuring rock pieces, power ballads and a barbershop quartet of former Tory leaders. Performed at York's Theatre Royal, the Edinburgh Fringe and the Pleasance Theatre, Islington, TONY! has been described by the BBC as \\"sharp, engaging and original,\\" and as \\"a shining example of honest comedy writing.\\" It has also been criticized for crude caricatures and cheap one-liners. Nonetheless, the play won the NSDF & Pleasance Edinburgh Competition 2007. As part of the prize the production transferred to the Pleasance Theatre, Islington, for a limited run in late September 2007. The production returned to the Edinburgh Fringe in August 2008, alongside its sequel Tony of Arabia. Previews were performed at the Oxford North Wall and the Theatre Royal, Wakefield, in July 2008. Synopsis The production begins with a news reporter announcing the fall of Tony Blair, before the erstwhile prime minister is carried onstage, funeral- style, by four pallbearers, to melancholic chants of \\"Tony!\\". He is then thrown to the ground to the crash of a drum fill, where he begins to sing the opening number, \\"Tony's Entrance,\\" in which he declares his intention to recount the past ten years of his career to the audience, while the ex- pallbearers perform an ironic 1990s boy band-style dance. It then returns to Blair's election victory in 1997, in which he waves to adoring crowds and congratulates deputy prime minister John Prescott and chancellor Gordon Brown on their success. An aide then arrives to tell him the people are calling for him, at which point a second aide rushes on with a guitar for him to play. A single spotlight then illuminates Tony for his first monologue, in which he tells of the wonder of these first glorious days in power, and of how he became the 'people's prime minister.' He then kneels to pray, attempting to sneakily ask God for a report on how he's doing so far, before being interrupted by the angelic ghost of Diana, Princess of Wales. A clearly uninterested Diana tells him to become the next princess, the people's prime minister, and then warns him against a future of joining George W. Bush in invading Iraq, before drifting mysteriously away, leaving a completely nonplussed Tony in the spotlight. Although bewildered by Diana's \\"cryptic prophecies,\\" Tony realises his destiny as prime minister, and sits purposefully at his desk to begin work. His wife Cherie then enters to visit, but is indifferently shunted to one side to make way for the entrance of Peter Mandelson, Tony's closest advisor, who is portrayed as a camp and serpentine character and brings a homoerotic element to the Blair story. Bathed in a soft, romantic light, Tony and Peter both tell the audience of their mutual admiration. They exit the stage, leaving a rejected Cherie to sing the poignant \\"No Me In Tony,\\" a theme which is reprised by various characters throughout the production. Tony re-enters with a jealous Peter, before being joined by Gordon Brown, who probingly raises the issue of their deal (for Tony to hand over the premiership to Gordon in due course), their \\"little chat.\\" Tony reassures Gordon that he will keep his promise and exits, leaving Gordon, Peter and John Prescott to sing the jolly piece, \\"My Mate Tony.\\" Tony returns from a holiday in Italy, and the four talk of their plans to bring the party to the people, before singing the playful \\"Open Politics,\\" in which they gradually realise that, despite good intentions, there is in fact nothing they ever wish to talk about with the public. Tony then tells the audience of his need to bring in \\"a professional\\" to better his public image and introduces the notorious spin-doctor Alastair Campbell. Although the others are sceptical, Tony is totally taken in by Alastair's promises of glory and together the two of them sing \\"Evita Peron,\\" an overdriven song in which Tony narcissistically declares himself to be the love-child of Madonna and Martin Luther King. So pleased is he with Campbell that he decides to let go of Peter, abandoning him on stage to reprise \\"No Me In Tony.\\" Once again in the spotlight, Tony recounts to the audience how the Conservative opposition was no competition, before a barbershop quartet of former Tory leaders - John Major, William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard - shuffle on stage in boaters to sing their comic song in which they lament how they all fell foul of Mr. Blair. After this, Tony introduces George W. Bush with a recitative, who bounces on stage as a delinquent cowboy with a toy horse and screeches the bluesy song \\"George's Entrance.\\" As with Campbell, Tony is taken with the gutsy George, though as the president leaves, Gordon once again enters to moodily remind Tony of their deal, and scold him for forgetting his own people. After a heated exchange, Gordon pleads to Tony with the moving \\"We Had A Deal,\\" reminding his friend of how things used to be. An almost heartbroken Tony remembers how much his old friend means to him, but refuses to acquiesce, and a defeated Gordon strides out. The disturbed Tony then suffers a heart murmur, and is hospitalised. Cherie joins him and begs him to slow down and think of his family, in the song \\"Hand Of History,\\" but, in the same number, Tony insists he has a destiny and refuses to give up, and, like Gordon before her, Cherie leaves disappointed. An excited George Bush returns and the pair exchange various crude jokes on the subject of Islamic extremists and the like. However, their fun is interrupted by an unimpressed Campbell, who informs Tony that there is no more he can do to save Tony's flagging image. At the end of his tether, Tony dismisses him, and Campbell reprises \\"No Me In Tony\\" for the final time, joined on stage by Cherie, Peter and Gordon. As they all dejectedly leave, a departing Campbell tells Tony of his imminent appearance on Newsnight with the dreaded interviewer Jeremy Paxman. The thundering rock number \\"Newsnight\\" then begins, in which Tony is grilled by Paxman, and, without Campbell's help, completely flounders. Tony is then left alone on stage to tell the audience that all political leaders make mistakes, but attempts to convince them of his much-admired integrity. However, in a nightmare sequence, he is again interrupted by Gordon with a reprise of \\"We Had A Deal,\\" and, gradually, Peter, Campbell and George return and revive various themes in a final medley. The appearance of Diana telling Tony that he has let the people down is the final straw, yet, even at the last, he pathetically reprises a desperate version of \\"Evita Peron\\" as everyone leaves him alone on stage. The solitary Tony then breaks down in tears, but is disturbed by a little boy - Tom - who asks him why he is crying and tells him he's come with his family to meet the prime minister. Realising that Tom means him, Tony lets the boy sit in his office chair, from which he begins a long- winded monologue about his daddy's views on politics, concluding that his daddy thinks Tony is \\"a star.\\" Establishing that Tom's daddy wasn't given a peerage, Tony gives him a present - his prize guitar - and begins to sing the anthemic finale song \\"Faith.\\" The entire cast then join him on stage for the final chords, and a reinvigorated Tony tells Gordon that he's going to go for it one more time as the musical ends.

Bush, who promise glitz and glamour. * Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and a solemn and resentful figure who is obsessed by Tony's promise that he will soon hand over the premiership to him. * John Prescott, the deputy prime minister and blustering, though confident, idiot of a man who speaks nothing but utter nonsense. * Princess Diana, the late princess of Wales who disinterestedly returns from the dead as the Official Goodwill Ambassador for the Afterlife to guide Tony on his mission as man of the people. * Cherie Booth, Tony's wife, who, although devoted to her husband, finds herself pushed to one side to make way for his career and close colleagues. * Peter Mandelson, a close advisor to Tony, who is portrayed as camp and vaguely sinister, and deeply in love with his master. * Alastair Campbell, Tony's Machiavellian spin-doctor, and a manipulative, superior and amoral man. * John Major, the first of the former Tory leaders. * William Hague, the second of the former Tory leaders. * Iain Duncan Smith, the third of the former Tory leaders, who, in fact, confuses himself with William Hague and ruins the first attempt at the song. * Michael Howard, the fourth and most evil of the former Tory leaders. * George W. Bush, the ludicrously simple and childish president of the United States, who wins over Tony instantly with the glamour of America. While the original actor, Alex Stevens, portrayed Bush as a delinquent toddler, Gavin Whitworth (who took up the role in 2008) was much truer to Bush's actual mannerisms, giving the character a more sinister and self-assured edge. * Jeremy Paxman, the aggressive presenter of Newsnight, the news review programme, who relentlessly grills Tony on the failings of his premiership. * Wife, a woman ('Mrs. Harriet Jones') who complains on Newsnight to Tony about her and her husband's failed pension schemes. * Husband, her partner, who also tells the prime minister of how they cannot afford university top-up fees and of how his eldest son is fighting in Iraq. * Tom, the innocent little boy who meets Tony after his resignation and tells him how much he and his 'daddy' admire him.

Songs that were cut included: * Tony's Theme, a simple rock piece in which Tony, instead of giving a speech to the adoring crowds, is encouraged by his colleagues to sing a song for them. With guitar in hand, he introduces his \\"average-Joe-public-school-boy\\" character and his ambitions as a youthful, people's prime minister. The song features soon after \\"Tony's Entrance,\\" before the scene between Tony and the ghost of Princess Diana. * War! a song about the Iraq War in which George W. Bush cheerily fires up Tony and sings optimistically about the situation in Iraq, while a trio of war-weary soldiers alternate between chants of \\"war!\\" and mournful laments about their dire circumstances. The loss of this song caused the Iraq element of Tony Blair's premiership to be almost entirely sidelined. However, when the production was transferred to the Pleasance Theatre in Islington from 19‚Äì22 September 2007, the above songs were re-included. In addition, Bush and McCluskey added another song, \\"I Did It For Tony,\\" a jazzy number in which Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson argue over each other's rightful place as Tony's true henchman, and Campbell bullies Mandelson about his homosexuality. The song features after \\"I Am Evita Peron,\\" immediately before Mandelson's dismissal. When the show returned to the 2008 Edinburgh festival, the cuts and \\"I Did It For Tony\\" were retained.

The pattern was chosen after laboratory and field tests from 2003 to 2004 showed it to provide the best concealment in many different operational environments. It beat ten other patterns (though UCP may still have been adopted without field testing against other patterns because senior military leaders liked it). Its pixelated pattern is similar to the MARPAT and CADPAT camouflage patterns used by the United States Marine Corps and the Canadian Armed Forces, respectively. Soldiers in Afghanistan questioned the effectiveness of the all-terrain pattern. The Army then conducted several studies to find a modification or replacement for the standard issue pattern. In July 2014, the Army announced that Operational Camouflage Pattern would replace all UCP-patterned ACU uniforms by the end of September 2019,.https://www.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/396739.pdfhttp://www.armyuniformchanges.com/wp- content/uploads/2015/03/New-OCP-Uniform-Fielding-Update.jpg However, UCP does remain in service in limited capacities, such as on some cold weather overgear and older body armor.https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/10/01/say- goodbye-hated-army-ucp-uniform.html Additionally, after having used the OCP for several years as their own deployment uniform, the United States Air Force also decided to adopt the OCP as their sole utility uniform for all Airmen, both in-garrison and deployed, to replace their current pixelated utility uniform, the Airman Battle Uniform, which was similar in appearance to UCP. The wear-out date for the Air Force ABU is 1 April 2021. Selection U.S. soldiers in May 2017 wearing the ACU in UCP Phase IInitial patterns and colors= Three patterns were developed, called All Over Brush, Track, and Shadow/Line. For each pattern, there were four color combinations, which corresponded to a specific type of terrain, however, all four patterns used tan as their base color. The three remaining colors were green, brown, and black for the Woodland pattern, dark tan, khaki, and brown for the Desert pattern, light gray, medium gray, and black for the Urban pattern, and dark tan, light gray, and brown for the Desert/Urban pattern. =Test sites= There were fifteen evaluations, which took place at Fort Benning, Fort Polk, Fort Irwin, Fort Lewis, and Yakima, Washington. The camouflage patterns were then rated on their blending, brightness, contrast, and detection by U.S. Army soldiers, during the daytime, and also at night using night vision devices. =Elimination of patterns= Following testing, the Shadow Line pattern was eliminated entirely, along with the urban and desert/urban patterns of All Over Brush. All four of the Track patterns were accepted along with All Over Brush's woodland and desert patterns. Phases II and III The patterns were then modified and tested alongside a newly introduced \\"Contractor- Developed Mod\\" pattern, MultiCam. Near infrared testing determined that black, medium gray, and medium tan were the only colors that gave acceptable performance. Phase IV (system level) All four remaining patterns, desert Brush, MultiCam, Woodland Track, and Urban Track were then tested alongside each other in urban, woodland, and desert environments. Results The desert Brush design received the best overall mean daytime visual rating. Contractor developed pattern received highest rating in woodland environments, but low ratings in desert and urban environments. Urban Track was generally the 3rd or 4th worst performer at each site, but was the best performer in nighttime environments. Infrared testing showed negligible differences in the performance of the four patterns. Natick rated the patterns from best to worst as: Desert Brush, Woodland Track Mod, Contractor-Developed Mod, and Urban Track. Color selection The color scheme of the Army Combat Uniform is composed of tan (officially named Desert Sand 500), gray (Urban Gray 501), and sage green (Foliage Green 502). The pattern is notable for its elimination of the color black. Justification given for the omission of black was that black is a color not commonly found in nature. Pure black viewed through night vision goggles can appear extremely dark and create an undesirable high- contrast image. Controversy Kunar province, Afghanistan The U.S. Army incorrectly reported to the media that the basis for the UCP was the Urban Track pattern, which had been modified through the removal of black from the pattern and pixelated. Pattern comparisons subsequently established that the information provided by the U.S. Army was incorrect, and that the pattern was simply a three-colored version of MARPAT, a derivative of the Canadian CADPAT scheme. No evidence has been presented by the U.S. Army that the new UCP pattern had undergone proper field testing. Following building criticism of the poor effectiveness of the pattern in most terrains like the Afghan and Middle Eastern theatres of operations, the use of the pattern was discussed within the US Senate. When passed by the Senate, House of Representatives Bill 2346 required the Department of Defense to \\"take immediate action to provide combat uniforms to personnel deployed to Afghanistan with a camouflage pattern that is suited to the environment of Afghanistan.\\" The Army subsequently initiated re-evaluation of existing and alternative camouflage patterns to determine if this was a necessary action. In recent tests conducted by the U.S. Army's Natick Soldier Systems Center (NSRDEC), results indicated that three other patterns did significantly better than UCP in desert and woodland environments. Four commercial submissions were tested to replace UCP for Army use. Discontinuation and replacement In 2014, the United States Army discontinued the Universal Camouflage Pattern, and Army researchers worked on a new and better camouflage. Four new patterns were tested to give soldiers different patterns suitable for different environments, plus a single neutral pattern, to be used on more expensive body armor and other gear. The selection involved hundreds of computer trials as well as on-the-ground testing at half a dozen locations around the world. In May 2014, the Army announced that a pattern called Scorpion, a pattern similar to MultiCam that was developed for the Objective Force Warrior program in 2002 and modified in 2009 (W2 version), had been chosen as the replacement for UCP. On 31 July 2014, the Army formally announced that the Operational Camouflage Pattern would begin being issued on uniforms in summer 2015. The name Operational Camouflage Pattern is to emphasize its use beyond Afghanistan to all combatant commands, with a family of versions, including a dark jungle-woodland variant and a lighter pattern for deserts. The Universal Camouflage Pattern was discontinued by the Army at the end of September 2019 for uniforms, though still sees some limited usage on other gear such as some body armor and cold weather overgear. As the military began phasing out the UCP, many state defense forces began adopting it as their uniform.

The label was formed at F2 studios in London with studio owner Rob Mcluhan. Pound had recorded \\"Total Confusion\\" at F2 and decided to form his own label in partnership with the studio, teaming up with the in-house producer Pete Smith to form The Hypnotist. The label's first release \\"Rainbows in the sky\\" became an instant hit and was quickly followed by \\"The House Is Mine\\" and \\"Hardcore You Know the Score\\", three tracks that defined the sound of techno through the decade.Vocals and samples for all three were provided by Andy Higgins who also ran the export and production of the label in the early years, according to Colin Larkin in The Guinness Who's Who of Rap, Dance and Techno. Rising High licensed Frankfurt's Harthouse label to the UK, pioneering German trance music, a genre then little known in the UK; and licensed Underground Resistance for their debut UK release. Rising High was also among the first to champion hardcore techno and ambient chill-out music in the UK. In 1995 Rising High established an American branch for their label in Santa Monica, California under the Rising High USA banner, but would fold operations in 1996.

Hart adapted the play for a 1944 motion picture directed by George Cukor. Plot summary Winged Victory tells the story of a group of recruits struggling to make it through pilot training. The trainees are a cross-section of American young men. Their personal lives, their families and sweethearts make up a small part of the story, but most of the drama focuses on training and camaraderie. Music plays a large part in the play, and most of the huge cast were primarily members of a chorus under the direction of famed choral leader Leonard de Paur. Among the musical numbers are \\"My Little Dream Book of Memories,\\" and the stirring title anthem, \\"Winged Victory\\". Background Upon recommendation of Lt. Col. Dudley S. Dean, who had been approached with the idea by talent agent Irving Lazar and Lt. Benjamin Landis, Air Forces Commanding General Henry H. Arnold commissioned famed playwright Hart to create a stage drama that would depict both the training and work of airmen and also the commitment and devotion to duty with which they carried out this work. Arnold gave Hart complete access to Air Forces resources. Hart traveled the United States visiting Air Forces bases and seeing firsthand how training was carried out. He then wrote an extremely patriotic and uplifting stage play based on his research. Hart partnered with Irving Lazar to produce the play and to gather actors for the huge (nearly 300) cast. Casting calls went out not only to well-known names but to Army units around the country for Air Forces personnel with theatrical or performing background. All male personnel involved with the show were service members of the U.S. Army Air Forces and were billed with their actual ranks. Among the then-notable or eventually-to-become-notable members of the cast and crew were Keith Andes, Alan Baxter, Don Beddoe, Whit Bissell, Sascha Brastoff, Red Buttons, Lee J. Cobb, Mario Lanza, Mark Daniels, Leonard De Paur, Brad Dexter, John Forsythe, Peter Lind Hayes, Harry Horner, Richard Travis, Karl Malden, Billy and Bobby Mauch, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Ray Middleton, Barry Nelson, Edmond O'Brien, Walter Reed, George Reeves, Martin Ritt, Archie Robbins, David Rose, Henry Rowland, Alfred Ryder, Howard Shoup, Henry and Jack Slate, Claude Stroud, Don Taylor, and Victor Sen Yung. Most of the relatively few roles for women in the play were portrayed by wives of the actors. Production The play opened in Boston, Massachusetts in the fall of 1943, in a pre-Broadway run, and was a huge success. It then opened in New York at the 44th Street Theatre on 20 November 1943 and became a smash hit, playing to over 350,000 people in 226 performances. During the New York run, performers in the show also toured local military camps, providing entertainment to the troops. A number of Winged Victory actors also rehearsed and produced a production of the play Yellow Jack by Sidney Howard, under the direction of Martin Ritt, which played briefly and simultaneously on Broadway. The successful run of Winged Victory on Broadway ended only in order that the entire cast travel to Hollywood to appear in the film version. Adaptation Twentieth Century Fox purchased the rights and contracted the full cast and in the summer of 1944 produced a film version (which featured a few actors who had not been in the play, including Lon McCallister and Judy Holliday), under the direction of George Cukor. Tour Following filming, the company embarked on a national tour of the play, performing 445 times for over 800,000 people in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver, Kansas City, Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore (where the theatre proved too small to admit the huge section of a bomber, part of the set for one scene), Washington D.C., and Richmond. At tour's end in April, 1945, the cast and crew were dispersed throughout the Army Air Forces, many of them transferring to the First Motion Picture Unit in California, there to make training films. The Winged Victory company (officially known as the 31st AAF Base Unit) officially disbanded in November 1945.Unit History, 31st AAF Base Unit, Air Force Historical Research Agency, Maxwell Air Force BaseWertheim, Albert: \\"The Dramatic Art of Uncle Sam: The Government, Drama, and World War II.\\" American Drama, Winter 2004 Due both to its enormous cast and staging demands as well as to the extremely era-specific nature of the play, Winged Victory is one of the biggest hits in Broadway history never to have a second production anywhere.

In most incarnations, its roster includes several Filipino characters mostly based on myths and thus many of them are easily recognizable to the viewing public. The original, line-up is Sandata, Supremo, Diwata, and Sidapa. The team was assisted by Bernardo Karpio also known as the Kapampangan God Apu Malyari, who became the first hero to be invited by the four founders. The team soon included Narra, Alamid, Lam-ang, Anino, Adarna and reservists Bato and Datu Pag-asa. Publication history Created by writer/artist Ner Pedrina, the team first appeared in Handicrapcomix #5 (February 1998). Most team members have distinctly Filipino attributes, such as having Kapampangan or Tagalog heritage . Throughout most of its history, the team has worked with the government to deal with super-powered villains. The team made its debut in Handicrapcomix #5 (1998). Although the team hasn't really been in publication, Sandugo had its small following due to its internet presence and commissioned fanart from fans and well-known Filipino artists. In 2007 they were launched in Sanduguan comics. The team has been well received since inception. It was even included in the well known website internationalhero.co.uk Sanduguan Universe that spotlights other countries characters aside from the big two mainstream publishers of the same genre. The team's concept was loosely based on the sanduguan ritual (blood compact) done by recruited Katipuneros who fought the Spanish occupation in Philippine History as their oath to the movement. Fictional team biography The team Sandugo was formed when the Maharlikan god of evil Siginarugan escaped his hundreds of years imprisonment and decided to wreak havoc on the new world. Creating monstrous automatons, he sowed fear and destruction in the mega city of Kalayaan, formerly known as Clarkfield in Pampanga. Sandata in his civilian identity was in the area, and jumped in to stop the rampaging monsters. He was soon joined by the beautiful Diwata who was warned of the event in her sanctorium. Sidapa, the hand of death alarmed by the unscheduled deaths of civilians soon joined to investigate. A mysterious figure also saw what was transpiring on television decided to survey the commotion. The four heroes having difficulty in the battle decided to pool their resources then managed to defeat the monster and finally faced the evil maharlikan. The fight continuous for a length of time until Siginarugan was exhausted due to not being in full power yet. He was then buried by a large amount of rubbles thrown from a distance by the mysterious figure. Drained and almost powerless, the evil dark god escaped retribution. The four seeing the carnage and destruction caused by the battle has then decided to band together to prevent similar events from happening. Supremo called the team Sandugo. During their early days, the team operated from Diwata's sanctorium located in Arayat mountain, having access to various mystical means to help them in their cause. Soon, they learned the identity of the mysterious figure who helped them in their first battle with Siginarugan. The mysterious figure was revealed to Bernardo Karpio, the legendary strong man of Philippine myths. Soon thereafter, they recruited various heroes to fill their team, they have decided to have an active roster of eight heroes in relation to the number of provinces who waged war against the Spanish regime. It was also at this time that they were able to established their charter and work with the government, helping in extra-special matters that cannot be resolved by the resources of the government. Pre-regular series The team Sandugo first appeared in Handicrapcomix #5, February 1998, in which they fought various malignos that crossed-over to the earth realm. This is also the team's first meeting with Bato The Agimat Warrior. The initial makeup of Sandugo was pan-Filipino, including: * Sandata: Jay Avila is an FMA instructor from Mabalacat, Pampanga who uses techno-magical batons, allowing him to upgrade his abilities. Sandata is sometimes the team leader, and wears a costume inspired by the Philippine flag. * Diwata: Luzviminda, from Arayat, is a half-breed angkantada. * Supremo: Juan dela Cruz is the living personification of the Filipino spirit wielding an enchanted bolo. * Sidapa: A former policeman from the line of Macabebe Warriors who became the messenger of death. * Bernardo Karpio: first recruit, who claims to be the strongman of the myth who escaped his hundred of years imprisonment. Sanduguan: Sanction The team appeared again online in 2003, this time the story was written by Alex Osias, when they were rescuing people kidnapped by Chinese pirates. This issue made first mention of the government-sanctioned team Katipunan, Inc. A companion was released that details the secret history of the team, the recruits and character profiles. The new additions to the roster included: * Narra: The defender of the green. * Lam-Ang: The immortal warrior. * Anino: The master of the shadows * Alamid: The feline warrior. Sanduguan Regular Series In 2007 due to public demand, Ner Pedrina launched the new series on Komikon where they are in battle with the demi-god Vital and his Acolytes for the \\"Matang Bathala\\". The team were transported to an alternate earth where they team-up with a super-powered group of Philippine revolutionaries against the technological might of the Spaniards. The evil god Siginarugan, once again made an attack to the earth plane with the help of various malignos. They were thwarted by the combined might of Sandugo, Zodiac Force, Bayan Knights and the Pantheon of Philippine Gods. New additions to the roster includes: * Adarna: The fiery goddess. * Bato, The Agimat Warrior: The agimat wielding warrior, first honorary member turned regular member. * Datu Pag-Asa: The time displaced datu, second honorary member.

The treaty was designed to allow for local self-government while giving the British control of foreign and military affairs. It was intended to conclude an agreement made at the Cairo Conference of 1921 to establish a Hashemite Kingdom in Iraq. In the aftermath of the First World War, most possessions of the Ottoman Empire were divided between France and Britain, with the remainder becoming the present-day country of Turkey. The former Ottoman provinces of Baghdad, Mosul, and Basra were proposed to become a League of Nations Class A mandate under direct British rule, known as the British Mandate for Mesopotamia. The idea of a ‚Äúmandate‚Äù was seen with serious skepticism among many of the people of the region as a thinly veiled attempt at colonization, and in fact the mandate was not implemented, as a widespread revolt broke out in 1920, after which it was decided that the territories would become instead the Kingdom of Iraq. On 23 August 1921, Faisal ibn Hasayn was crowned as Faisal I, King of Iraq. Concurrently, the area acquired by the new kingdom was going through a period of political turmoil. Nationalists who believed that the expulsion of the Ottomans would lead to greater independence were disappointed at the system of government decided for the British Mandate of Mesopotamia. Rather than the people of the region gaining a new sense of national identity through self- government, the British imported civil servants from India who had previous knowledge and experience of how to manage the administration of an overseas possession. The Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1922 served to prevent uprisings in the intended new Kingdom of Iraq by giving Britain direct control of the kingdom's military, and significant influence over its economic and political affairs. French interests in the Middle East in blue, British in red. Overlapping in Palestine which was the British interest in the Levant. This overlap was created to allow for a British railroad concession between the oil rich Persian Gulf and the Levant. The French interests allowed the French to gain the former German railroad concessions between Allepo and oil rich northern Mesopotamia. The Sykes-Picot Agreement During the First World War, the Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement was struck between the foreign ministers of Great Britain and France on behalf of their respective governments on a vision of a post war division of the Ottoman Empire in which the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire (south and west of Anatolia) would be split into spheres of influence for the French and British. > > That France and Great Britain are prepared to recognize and protect an > independent Arab states or a confederation of Arab states (a) and (b) marked > on the annexed map, under the suzerainty of an Arab chief.

Insurgency The Anglo-Iraqi Treaty was signed due mostly to the strenuous efforts of the people of the former Ottoman provinces, a coalition of both Sunni and Shia Arabs. Major centres of insurgency during what was later called the \\"Great Iraqi Revolution\\" of 1920 included, Baghdad, Najaf, and Karbala. The insurgency effort in Karbala was inflamed by a fatwa issued by the grand mujtahid, Imam Shirazi. This fatwa made the observation that it was contrary to the principles of Islam for the region to be ruled by the British, who did not practice Islam. The fatwa ordered a jihad against the British forces of occupation. The Kurds of the northern part of the region also waged war on the British in the years following the signing and ratification of the treaty. They sought separation from newly created Iraq, aiming to establish a separate homeland for themselves. Their efforts at revolt were tempered by the British, in large part due to air to ground attacks conducted by the Royal Air Force, but the aid of other Kurds to defeat the revolt were of significant consequence. The Cairo Conference The Cairo Conference of 1921 would set the stage for greater Iraqi autonomy. The British appointed Faisal ibn Hasayn to lead the country as the first King of Iraq. Faisal was seen as a compromise between British interests in the country, and the revolutionary nationalists; he could trace his family lineage back to the Prophet Muhammad, as well as having participated in the 1916 Arab revolt against the Ottomans. However, the British still saw Faisal as dependent enough of their support to bend him under pressure. The Signing the treaty was controversial in Great Britain because of a very strong ‚ÄòQuit Mesopotamia; (or 'Quit Iraq)‚Äô movement. If Iraq did not ratify, Britain might have withdrawn from Iraq. The key player in obtaining the support was High Commissioner, Sir Henry Dobbs. He took full advantage of distance to make decisions and act in line with his own, not London‚Äôs approach. The treaty was signed on behalf of the British by Sir Percy Cox on 10 October 1922. However, it was not ratified by the Iraqi government until 1924. It was only when the Dobbs threatened to wield his authority to scrap the constitution, drafted by the Iraqi constituent assembly, that the treaty was finally ratified. It was seen with disdain by many of the people of the new Kingdom, both Sunni and Shia. While it was the first step towards complete independence from the imperial powers.

He played for the Boston Braves, Brooklyn Dodgers and Pittsburgh Pirates. Listed at , 180 lb., he was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed. From the death of Connie Marrero on April 23, 2014 until his own death on April 4, 2016, Sandlock was the oldest living former major league player. That distinction was passed on to Eddie Carnett. Early life Sandlock was born in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, to parents who were Polish immigrants. As a teenager, Sandlock dreamed of playing professional baseball after he attended a game at Yankee Stadium and Babe Ruth hit a home run over his head. He served as a batboy for the local fire department's baseball team. Sandlock did not attend high school, but he had some trade school training. He worked as an electrician and was making $200 per month when he quit to become a professional baseball player. He took a pay cut of more than 50% when he entered baseball. Career Between 1938 and 1942, Sandlock was a minor league player in Huntington, West Virginia; Bradford, Pennsylvania; Hartford, Connecticut; and Evansville, Indiana. Chiefly a catcher, Sandlock also saw action at shortstop and at second and third base. Sandlock and Warren Spahn were roommates and they were called up together by the Braves in September 1942. Sandlock appeared in two games that year. He spent 1943 working in a munitions plant and playing for a touring USO team under manager Chuck Dressen. He returned to Boston before playing for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1945‚Äì46. Sandlock's most productive season came in 1945 with Brooklyn, when he hit .282 with two home runs and 17 runs batted in in 80 games played, all career highs. He also spent time in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) with the Hollywood Stars (1949‚Äì1952). The PCL was popular at the time since MLB had not yet reached the West Coast. Sandlock said that he made twice the amount of money with the Stars as he did in the major leagues, and he noted that the Stars' games were often attended by celebrities such as movie stars. With the Stars, Sandlock became adept at catching the knuckleball thrown by pitcher Johnny Lindell. The knuckleball's odd movement was notoriously difficult for catchers to handle. When Lindell's contract was purchased by the Pittsburgh Pirates for the 1953 season, Sandlock was promoted with him. The arrangement did not work well, as Lindell led the league in wild pitches (11) and Sandlock allowed a league-leading 15 passed balls in only 64 games. After the 1953 season, Sandlock was purchased by the Philadelphia Phillies, but he did not return to the major leagues. He spent his final season in minor league baseball as the San Diego Padres won the 1954 PCL pennant. Over parts of five major league seasons, Sandlock was a .240 hitter (107-for-446) with two home runs and 31 RBI in 195 games, including 34 runs, 19 doubles, two triples, and two stolen bases. Later life After retiring from baseball, Sandlock became a carpenter and handyman. He was an active golfer in his later life, winning several championships at his local golf club. He sometimes played with Jackie Robinson, whom he had befriended during spring training with Brooklyn in the 1940s. Sandlock was married to the former Victoria Suchocki for 42 years until she died in 1982. They had two sons and one daughter. Sandlock turned 100 in October 2015, and died on April 4, 2016.Jensen, Tim (April 5, 2016). Baseball's oldest living former major leaguer dies. Greenwich Patch. Retrieved April 6, 2016.

It is endemic to Lake Baikal, being the dominant zooplankton species there: 80%‚Äì90% of total biomass. It measures . Epischurella baikalensis inhabits the entire water column, and produces two generations per year: the winter‚Äìspring and the summer. These copepods develop under different ecological conditions and vary in the duration of life stages, reproduction time, maturation of sex products and adult males and females lifespan. The total life period of the animals from each generation is one year. One female can produce 10 egg sacs every 10‚Äì20 days during its lifetime. The ratio of males and females is 1:1. One of the most essential features of the ecology of E. baikalensis is the alteration of its mass inhabited areas during a year, as well as in day time. This is due to the need for various conditions for gonad maturation, reproduction, nourishing and protection from being consumed by planktivores. It is the Epischurella baikalensis which keeps Lake Baikal clean.  Taxonomy  \\"Epischura baicalensis\\" is a misnomer common in modern literature (e.g., 13 publications in WoS/Biological abstracts since 1989 vs. none for \\"Epischura baikalensis\\"). However, the original description (Sars, 1900) lists the species as Epischura baikalensis G.O.Sars, n. sp.. Recent genetic analyses of mtDNA loci resurrected Epischurella as the correct genus name (Smirnov, 1936), and Epischurella baikalensis should be used in all publications.

It is a sequel to the 1968 novel Black Easter: they have been subsequently republished in 1990 as a single book called The Devil's Day. Plot summary Black Easter and The Day After Judgment were written with the assumption that the ritual magic for commanding demons, as described in grimoires, actually works. In the first book, a wealthy arms manufacturer comes to a black magician, Theron Ware, with a strange request: he wishes to release all the demons from Hell on Earth for one night to see what might happen. The book includes a lengthy description of the summoning ritual and a detailed description of the grotesque demons as they appear. Tension between Ware and Catholic white magicians arises over the terms and conditions of a covenant that provides for observers and limitations on interference with demonic workings. Black Easter ends with Baphomet announcing to the participants that the demons cannot be compelled to return to Hell: the war is over and God is dead. The Day After Judgment develops and extends the characters from the first book. It suggests that God may not be dead, or that demons may not be inherently self-destructive, as something appears to be restraining the actions of the demons upon Earth. In a lengthy Miltonian speech at the end of the novel, Satan Mekratrig explains that, compared to humans, demons are good, and that if perhaps God has withdrawn Himself, then Satan beyond all others was qualified to take His place and, if anything, would be a more just god. It has been suggested that Blish got the name for his black magician from the titular character in Harold Frederic's 1896 novel The Damnation of Theron Ware.Ketterer, p. 298 The events end in a battle of men against demons in Death Valley, which ends in the supernatural place disappearing and leaving the characters in \\"the modern town of Badwater\\".

McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that states participating in Medicaid are not required to fund medically necessary abortions for which federal reimbursement was unavailable as a result of the Hyde Amendment, which restricted the use of federal funds for abortion.. The Court also held that the funding restrictions of the Hyde Amendment did not violate the Fifth Amendment or the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  Background  In 1965 Congress amended Title XIX of the Social Security Act to create Medicaid, a voluntary program to provide federal funds to states that choose to provide reimbursement for certain medical expenses for the indigent.448 U.S. at 301. In September 1976, Congress began, by amendment to the annual appropriations bill for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare or by joint resolution, to ban the use of federal funds to reimburse the cost of abortions under Medicaid.448 U.S. at 302. Initially, the only exception was if the life of the mother would be endangered by the fetus being carried to term. The restrictions became known as the Hyde Amendment, named for the measure's original sponsor, Illinois Representative Henry Hyde. The language of the 1980 Hyde Amendment provided: In 1976, after passage of the original Hyde Amendment, an action was brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York seeking to enjoin enforcement of the its restrictions. Plaintiffs were Cora McRae, a New York Medicaid recipient then in the first trimester of a pregnancy that she wished to abort, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corp., which operated hospitals providing abortion services, officers of the Women's Division of the Board of Global Ministries of the United Methodist Church, and the Women's Division itself.448 U.S. at 303. McRae sought to bring the action as a class action, on behalf of other similarly situated women. The district court granted the class certification motion and permitted US Senators James L. Buckley and Jesse Helms as well blas Hyde to intervene as defendants. The district court granted the injunction on January 15, 1980, and found that the Hyde Amendments violated the Fifth Amendment's Due Process clause and the First Amendment's Establishment clause. Supreme Court decision Justice Stewart delivered the opinion of the Court in which Chief Justice Burger, Justice White, Justice Powell, and Justice Rehnquist joined. Justice White wrote an opinion concurring the judgment. Justice Brennan wrote a dissent in which Justice Marshall and Justice Blackmun joined. Justice Marshall and Justice Blackmun also authored separate dissents, as did Justice Stevens. The Court held that states participating in the Medicaid program are not obligated to fund medically necessary abortions under Title XIX. The Court found that a woman's freedom of choice does not carry with it \\"a constitutional entitlement to the financial resources to avail herself of the full range of protected choices.\\" The Court ruled that because the Equal Protection Clause is not a source of substantive rights and because poverty does not qualify as a \\"suspect classification,\\" the Hyde Amendment does not violate the Fifth Amendment. Finally, the Court held that the coincidence of the funding restrictions of the statute with tenets of the Roman Catholic Church does not constitute an establishment of religion.

It was located in a building on what is now Monterey's Cannery Row on Monterey Bay in Monterey County, California. The building, activities, and business were fictionalized as \\"Western Biological Laboratory\\" by John Steinbeck in his novel Cannery Row, as was a character based on one of its founders, Ed Ricketts. After a 1936 fire Steinbeck invested in the laboratory and owned half its stock. History The company was started by Ed Ricketts with his college roommate and business partner Albert Galigher in 1923. Originally located in Pacific Grove at 165 Fountain Avenue, the lab was moved to 740 Ocean View Avenue, Monterey, California around January, 1930, where Ricketts became sole owner. Today, that location is 800 Cannery Row. As a result of marital problems between Ricketts and his first wife Anna, the lab served as Ricketts's home for some time beginning in 1936. On November 25, 1936, a fire broke out at the Del Mar Cannery next to the lab (site of today's Monterey Bay Aquarium) and most of the contents of the laboratory were destroyed. The manuscript for Between Pacific Tides survived the fire as it had already been sent to Stanford University for publication. It was Steinbeck that saved the lab financially after the fire with the purchase of half the company's stock. The onset of World War II led to the decline of the commercial operation of the lab. However, the legacy of the specimens collected and distributed by PBL lives on. Museums throughout the United States contain specimens collected by Ricketts, including the Field Museum in Chicago, the Smithsonian Institution, the California Academy of Sciences, the American Museum of Natural History, the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University and the Museum of Zoology at Lund University in Sweden. The lab became a meeting place for intellectuals, artists, and writers, including Bruce Ariss, Joseph Campbell, Henry Miller, John Steinbeck, Lincoln Steffens, and Francis Whitaker. Catalog Ricketts produced his first scientific publication, a catalog of marine biological specimens recorded in photographs and drawings. Originally meant for advertisement it may well have been the first record of Monterey Bay intertidal species. Preservation and Legacy In 1949, the Pacific Biological Laboratories building was sold to Yock Yee, a local grocer. High school literature teacher and jazz enthusiast Harlan Watkins began renting the Pacific Biological Laboratories building from Yock Yee and purchased it in 1956. In 1958, after Watkins had married and moved to Europe, friends of Watkins, including Frank Wright, Ed Haber, Joe Turner, Fred Fry and Ed Larsh, joined together to purchase the building under the name ‚ÄúPacific Biological Laboratories.‚Äù The building served as a weekly meeting place for club members, many of whom were prominent Monterey artists and writers. Founding club members also included nationally known cartoonists Hank Ketcham (creator of Dennis the Menace, Eldon Dedini and Gus Arriola. Several club members helped to start the Monterey Jazz Festival. The first festival was held in 1958. The Pacific Biological Laboratories club sold their building to the City of Monterey in December 1993 for $170,000. A seismic rehabilitation of the building was done in 1998. It was restored by the Cannery Row Foundation which was given the Governor's Award for Historic Preservation. On May 14, 1997, the 100th anniversary of Ricketts' birth, a commemorative plaque was placed on the 165 Fountain Avenue location by the Pacific Grove Heritage Society and the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History Association. The Pacific Biological Laboratories is on the National Register of Historic Places. Monthly tours are offered through the City of Monterey.

Education and career Scullin was born in Syracuse, New York. He attended Niagara University (Bachelor of Science, 1961), and Syracuse University College of Law (Bachelor of Laws, 1964). After graduating from law school, Scullin served in the United States Army as an Infantry Commander in Vietnam. Scullin practiced law as a private attorney and in various prosecutors' offices from 1967 to 1982. In 1982 he was appointed United States Attorney for the Northern District of New York by President Ronald Reagan. He served in the position for ten years until 1992. Judicial tenure On September 12, 1991, Scullin was nominated to the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York by President George H. W. Bush. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 6, 1992, and received his commission on February 10, 1992. He served as Chief Judge of the District from 2000 until March 13, 2006 when he assumed senior status. Scullin was also appointed by Chief Justice Rehnquist to the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for a term of seven years running from 2004 until 2011. Notable case On July 26, 2014, Judge Scullin struck down the District of Columbia's ban on carrying handguns outside of a person's home, saying that the ban violated the Second Amendment. He wrote that \\"there is no longer any basis on which this court can conclude that the District of Columbia's total ban on the public carrying of ready-to-use handguns outside the home is constitutional under any level of scrutiny.\\" In response to the ruling, the D.C. Metropolitan Police determined that non- residents bearing firearms in the district are subject to the handgun laws of their home jurisdiction; in effect, this makes the District much more permissive of firearms. On July 29, 2014, in response to a partially unopposed motion filed by the District of Columbia, Judge Scullin issued a 90-day stay of his initial order. The stay expired on November 28, 2014.

Born in Christchurch, Gray was accepted into the RAF in 1939 on a short service commission, after two previous attempts failed on medical grounds. He flew with No. 54 Squadron during the Battle of France. His twin brother, who had also joined the RAF and was a bomber pilot, was killed in a flying accident at this time. He flew extensively for the majority of the Battle of Britain and by September 1940, he had shot down 14 enemy aircraft and had been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). He fulfilled a training role for the next few months before returning to offensive operations in early 1941. Gray commanded No. 616 Squadron on the Channel Front and was awarded a Bar to his DFC before being sent to the Mediterranean theatre of operations to lead No. 64 Squadron. By 1943 he was a wing commander and flew a number of operations in the North African and Italian Campaigns. By the end of the year he had destroyed at least a further 13 enemy aircraft and been awarded the Distinguished Service Order. A return to Europe followed and in September 1944, he commanded a wing supporting the airbourne operations of the Battle of Arnhem. He finished the war with a confirmed 27 victories. After the war he held a number of staff and command positions in the RAF before his eventual retirement in 1961. He returned to New Zealand to work for Unilever. He died in 1995 at the age of 80. Early life Colin Falkland Gray and his twin brother Ken were born in Christchurch, New Zealand, on 9 November 1914, the sons of an electrical engineer, Robert Leonard Gray, and his wife, Margaret . He attended several different schools, including two years at Christ's College in Christchurch, a year at Wellesley College in Wellington, before finishing his formal education at Napier Boys' High School in Napier. He then gained employment as a clerk in 1933, working at a livestock company in Napier. In April 1937, Gray and his brother applied for a short service commission in the Royal Air Force (RAF). While Ken was accepted, Colin was rejected for health reasons; he was suffering influenza at the time of his medical examination. Gray then applied to join the Civilian Reserve of Pilots but was again rejected on medical grounds. Disregarding advice that he would unlikely to ever be deemed fit enough to serve in the RAF on account of osteomyelitis of a leg bone and being prone to conjunctivitis, Gray took up sheep mustering to improve his fitness. In September 1938 he successfully passed a medical and was subsequently accepted for a short service commission in the RAF. He had the opportunity to train with the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) but opted to go to the United Kingdom. His flight training commenced in early 1939 at No. 1 Elementary Flying Training School at Hatfield in Hertfordshire. He was posted to No. 11 Flying Training School in April, gained his wings in July, and graduated from advanced training in October as a probationary pilot officer in October 1939. Second World War With the Second World War underway, Gray was posted to No. 54 Squadron, at the time equipped with Supermarine Spitfires and based at Hornchurch, in November 1939. Another pilot at the squadron was fellow New Zealander Alan Deere, who would go on to have a notable career with the RAF during the war. During the early months of the war, the squadron alternated between Hornchurch and Rochford, undergoing training and carrying out patrols covering convoys in the North Sea. He was confirmed in his rank of pilot officer on 17 January 1940. Meanwhile, his brother Ken was a bomber pilot flying Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys. On 1 May 1940, he was flying south from his squadron's base in Scotland to visit Colin but was killed when his aircraft flew into a hill. The death of Ken greatly affected Colin's morale. Battle of France As the situation in France deteriorated after the German invasion, No. 54 Squadron began patrolling over Calais and Dunkirk. Gray flew his first sortie in the area on 16 May and first encountered the Luftwaffe on 24 May, when he engaged a pair of Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters. Firing at both, he claimed one as a probable and the other as a possible. Gray achieved his first confirmed enemy aircraft, a Bf 109, the next day while escorting a formation of Fairey Swordfish to dive-bomb Gravelines. His Spitfire received numerous cannon strikes in the engagement, and damage to the port aileron forced the aircraft into a dive that was controlled only with great difficulty. His aircraft had also lost its airspeed indicator and control of guns, flaps or brakes. Despite this damage, Gray managed to land safely at Hornchurch. With the pilots of the squadron exhausted after extensive operations over Dunkirk, it was withdrawn to Catterick in Yorkshire for a short rest. It returned to Hornchurch on 4 June and spent most of the month flying reconnaissance patrols into France and Belgium, monitoring the activities of the Germans. From 25 June, No. 54 Squadron started operating from Rochford and on 3 July, Gray engaged a Dornier Do 215 of 9./KG 77, claiming it as a probable. Battle of Britain A Spitfire Mk I being readied for a sortie during the Battle of Britain The first phase of the Battle of Britain commenced on 10 July 1940, when Luftwaffe attacks on targets along the coast of England and on shipping were stepped up in the Kanalkampf (Channel war). These were designed to draw out and destroy RAF Fighter Command, necessary for the proposed invasion of Britain. As part of No. 11 Group, tasked with the defence of southeast England, Gray's squadron was to be heavily involved in the Battle of Britain. On 13 July Gray shot down a Bf 109 near Calais having pursued it across the English Channel. A week and a half later, No. 54 Squadron intercepted a group of bombers escorted by 30 Bf 109s. Targeting the fighters, Gray shot down one Bf 109 and then a second. He observed the latter's pilot bailing out into the Channel and swimming for a dinghy. He radioed the man's position, but the pilot did not survive the water conditions. The next day, 25 July, he claimed a probable Bf 109 that was escorting a group of Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers attacking a convoy off Dover. On 26 July, No. 54 Squadron went back to Catterick for a rest, having flown more operations than any other in No. 11 Group; Gray had flown 68 sorties in July. Gray's squadron reentered the Battle of Britain on 8 August, operating again from Hornchurch. He soon added to his tally of victories, shooting down a pair of Bf 109s on 12 August, one near Dover and the other over Cap Gris- Nez, where it crashed onto a beach. He repeated the feat just a few days later when, on 16 August, he destroyed two Bf 109s of JG 54 during a dogfight over Dover. In the morning of 18 August, he shared in the destruction of a Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter and damaged a Dornier Do 17 bomber on a second sortie. On his third patrol of the day, he shot down another Bf 110 over Clacton, the enemy aircraft crashing onto the nearby beach. On 24 August, he shot down a further Bf 110 which he had encountered over Dover. Although he expended all his ammunition, the enemy aircraft was severely damaged with one crew member bailing out over the Channel and the aircraft itself, with Gray following at a distance, crashing into the sea off Cap Gris-Nez. He destroyed a Bf 109 on 25 August near Dover. His award of the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) was announced two days later, the published citation for his DFC reading: Two Bf 109s were damaged on 28 August, and in another sortie the same day, he damaged a Do 17. On the last day of the month, he downed another Bf 109, this time near Maidstone. Gray was in the area again the following day when he engaged three Heinkel He 111 bombers. With one of the He 111s having both its engines set ablaze by Gray's machine gun fire, he dove away out of ammunition but found his Spitfire had been damaged and his ailerons were inoperative. Despite this, he was able to land back at Hornchurch. Flying another Spitfire the same day, he had to make a forced landing when his engine was damaged following an encounter with Bf 109s over Biggin Hill. He flew five sorties on 2 September; he shot down a Bf 109 in the morning although his own aircraft received damage. He took to another Spitfire for his remaining sorties of the day, and destroyed a Bf 110 that was escorting bombers raiding Hornchurch. The following day, Gray shared in the destruction of a Bf 110 that was part of a raid on North Weald. Later in the day he shot down a Bf 109. This was his last engagement of the battle for at the end of the day, No. 54 Squadron flew north to rest and re-equip. Badly fatigued, he had flown over 60 sorties in August and encountered enemy aircraft on at least 16 occasions, and for the three days of September until his squadron's shift north, recorded 13 sorties. Alan Deere noted that at this time Gray was \\"noticeably more hollow- cheeked\\" in appearance. At this stage of the war, Gray had accounted for 14¬Ω enemy aircraft destroyed and was one of only four pilots who had been with the squadron when it began operating from Hornchurch in May. Based back at Catterick, No. 54 Squadron was deemed to be unsuitable for a return to operations and was placed in reserve. It fulfilled a training role with Gray teaching new pilots in aerial warfare. He was promoted to flying officer on 23 October and two months later was posted to No. 43 Squadron, which was also in reserve and equipped with Hawker Hurricanes. Although he considered the Hurricane nice to fly, he did prefer the Spitfire. He continued to train pilots sent from Operational Training Units until mid-January 1941, when he returned to No. 54 Squadron as one of its flight commanders. Channel Front By late February, No. 54 Squadron was back at Hornchurch and was carrying out offensive operations against targets in France. In the middle of the year, Gray was posted to No. 1 Squadron, which operated Hurricanes. He was the commander of one of the squadron's flights. One of the first sorties after his arrival involved escorting Westland Lysanders that were carrying out air- sea rescues in the English Channel, during which they encountered a Heinkel He 59 seaplane escorted by Bf 109s. Gray and another pilot shot down the He 59 and three Bf 109s were destroyed by others in the squadron. In July, No. 1 Squadron began operating from Tangmere, where its duties involved the protection of Allied shipping but it was also engaged in training for night interceptions. Gray was promoted to flight lieutenant in August 1941. The same month, he flew at least one operation with No. 41 Squadron to Le Havre, shooting down a Bf 109 on 22 August. In September, he was awarded a Bar to his DFC. The published citation read: At the end of September, Gray was promoted to acting squadron leader and posted to No. 616 Squadron, operating from Westhampnett, to serve as its commander. Part of the Tangmere Wing, the squadron operated Spitfire Vbs on daylight operations into occupied France. It soon shifted to north and switched to a patrol role, monitoring the east coast of England until early 1942, when it moved to Kings Cliffe. Shortly afterwards, Gray relinquished command to take up a staff posting at No. 9 Group, advising on fighter tactics. Returning to operations in September 1942, Gray spent a short period of time at No. 485 Squadron, largely made up of New Zealand flying personnel, before taking command of No. 64 Squadron, which operated the latest model of Spitfire, the Mk IX, over the English Channel and France. Its work included escorting the early bombing raids carried out by Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses of the United States Eighth Air Force. Mediterranean At the end of 1942, Gray was posted to the Mediterranean theatre of operations. Reporting to No. 333 Group in January 1943 he was sent to Gibraltar take command of No. 81 Squadron. Normally based in Algeria, the squadron's flying personnel were on the island to collect the first Spitfire Mk. IXs sent to the theatre. No. 81 Squadron flew across the Mediterranean back to Algeria towards the end of the month. Gray soon encountered the enemy; flying from Bone on 31 January 1, he led a group of Spitfires in an interception of a raid on Cap Negro. Three Bf 109s were shot down in this engagement. Although he made no official claim for this encounter, according to his memoir he did destroy one of three Bf 109s although gave the credit for it to his wingman. He claimed a Bf 109 as probably destroyed on 22 February and followed this up with another Bf 109 reported as damaged a few days later. With another pilot, he claimed a shared probable, a Bf 109, on 2 March. No. 81 Squadron moved to Souk-el-Khemis Airfield in mid-March and a week later Gray shot down a Macchi C.202 fighter. This was followed by a Bf 109 two days later. At the end of the month, he shot down another Bf 109, observing its pilot bail out after he scored hits at the wing root of the enemy aircraft. At the time, it was reported that his victim was the German flying ace Friedrich- Karl \\"Tutti\\" M√ºller but in fact it was another pilot with the same surname. Early the following month, soon after the squadron had taken off for a patrol, the engine of Gray's Spitfire began running rough. He turned back to the airfield which, since his departure, had been raided by a group of eight Focke Wulf Fw 190 fighter-bombers. Despite his engine issues, he pursued the Fw 190s but was unable to catch up. Giving up the chase, he returned to the airfield but then encountered and shot down a Bf 109. Gray, centre, wearing a Mae West lifejacket, after landing his Spitfire at Souk el Khemis, Tunisia, having just shot down his 20th enemy aircraft On 18 April, during a sweep over Tunis, Gray claimed a Bf 109 as a probable and had a share in the destruction of another Bf 109 two days later, a fellow pilot confirming the crash of the enemy aircraft. He destroyed a second Bf 109 over Tunis later the same day. Two more Bf 109s were destroyed later in the month. The campaign in North Africa ended the following month. For his leadership and actions during his period of service in North Africa, Gray was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). The citation, published on 1 June 1943 in the London Gazette, read: Gray was promoted to acting wing commander on 1 June and took over the leadership of No. 322 Wing, which at the time was based at Takali, on the island of Malta. The wing conducted offensive patrols and escorted bombers over the Italian coast. There was only occasional opposition from by the Luftwaffe. Gray shot down a Bf 109 on 14 June and this was followed by a C.202 a few days afterwards. On 1 July the wing flew in support of the Allied invasion of Sicily. That day, several Bf 109s ambushed the wing but Gray was able to shoot down one of the attacking fighters. No. 322 Wing moved to Lentini, on Sicily, towards the end of July. On 25 July 1943, he led 33 Spitfires of No. 322 Wing on a sweep to try and intercept Luftwaffe attempts to land supplies to the German ground forces near Milazzo. They encountered a large group of Junkers Ju 52 transports. Catching the escorting Bf 109s unawares, the Spitfires dived on the Ju 52s. At least 20 of the transports, many loaded with petrol, were destroyed, with Gray accounting for two of them, his last successes of the war. Four Bf 109s had also been destroyed by the Spitfires. Return to Europe Gray's acting rank of squadron leader was made substantive on 1 September 1943 and shortly afterwards he relinquished command of No. 322 Wing and was sent to Cairo to take up special duties at the headquarters of the RAF Middle East Command. In October, he returned to England and took up a staff post with No. 9 Group headquarters before taking command of No. 2 Combat Training Wing, based at Balado Bridge in Scotland. He was presented with his DSO by King George VI at Buckingham Palace on 9 November. Alan Deere, Gray's compatriot from his days at No. 54 Squadron, was present at the investiture as he was also receiving the DSO. At the same time, an award of a second Bar to Gray's DFC was announced. Gray only found out about this award when he read about it in a newspaper a few days later. At the end of 1943, Gray was moved to another training role, this time with No. 61 Operational Training Unit at Rednal. He remained here until June 1944, when he became commander of the Spitfire Wing at the Fighter Leader's School based at Millfield. Within a few months, he was appointed commander of the Lympne Wing, which carried out offensive operations and escort missions to France and the occupied Netherlands. In September his wing supported the airborne operations during the Battle of Arnhem. The next month he returned to Buckingham Palace to be presented with the second DFC Bar that he had been awarded the previous November. In January 1945, Gray attended a senior commander's course at RAF Cranwell before taking command of the RAF station at Skeabrae in the Orkney Islands. According to Gray in his memoirs, the main role of the Spitfire squadron based there was to protect the Royal Navy base at Scapa Flow. In April, his commission in the RAF was made permanent, with Gray holding the rank of squadron leader. Gray finished the war with 27 confirmed enemy aircraft destroyed, a half share in another destroyed, seven probably destroyed with half shares in four others, and 12 damaged. The top New Zealand fighter ace of the Second World War, he had recorded well over 600 hours of operational flying during the course of the conflict. Post-war Gray returned to New Zealand on secondment to the RNZAF from July 1945 to March 1946 although most of this period was spent on leave. His active duty in New Zealand primarily involved giving talks to units of the Air Training Corps. Back in England by March 1946 after the end of his secondment, Gray was promoted to acting wing commander, which was made substantive the following year, and posted to the Air Ministry to serve in the Directorate of Accidents Prevention and then, after attending a course at the RAF Staff College at Bracknell, in the Directorate of Air Foreign Liaison. In January 1950, Gray was sent to Washington, D.C. as an air liaison officer to the Joint Services Mission United States. In this role, he supervised the exchange program between the RAF and United States Air Force. He returned to the United Kingdom in September 1952, and after a period of time in an administrative role at a Gloster Meteor conversion unit at Stradishall, he commanded Church Fenton in Yorkshire from March 1954 to April 1956, during which time he was promoted to group captain. He was then posted to the headquarters of the Far East Air Force in Singapore. During the Malayan Emergency, he served as a staff officer with responsibility for aerial operations. He returned to the Air Ministry in early 1959 to take up a position under the assistant chief of air staff as deputy director at Fighter Operations. By now he was considering a return to New Zealand for family reasons and he subsequently retired from the RAF in March 1961. Later life Gray returned to New Zealand to work for Unilever in Petone as its personnel director until 1979, at which time he retired. He settled in Waikanae and in his later years, he wrote Spitfire Patrol, an autobiography detailing his time in the RAF and which was published in 1990. The same year, he returned to the United Kingdom for the fifty year anniversary celebrations of the Battle of Britain and formed part of the escort for the Roll of Honour in Westminster Abbey. He died in Kenepuru Hospital, Porirua, on 1 August 1995, survived by his wife, Betty, whom he had married in October 1945, and his four children and a stepdaughter. His remains were cremated and the ashes interred at Porirua Cemetery.

Lovins and L. Hunter Lovins, prepared originally as a Pentagon study and re-released in 2001 following the September 11 attacks. The book argues that the U.S. domestic energy infrastructure is very vulnerable to disruption, whether by accident or malice, often even more so than US technology is vulnerable to disruption of the imported oil supply. According to the authors, a resilient energy system is feasible, costs less, works better, and is favoured in the market, but is rejected by U.S. policy. In the preface to the 2001 edition, Lovins explains that these themes are still very current. Vulnerability to large-scale failures Lovins argues that the United States has for decades been running on energy that is \\"brittle\\" (easily shattered by accident or malice) and that this poses a grave and growing threat to national security, life, and liberty. Lovins explains that this danger comes not from hostile ideology but from misapplied technology. The size, complexity, pattern, and control structure of the electrical power system make it inherently vulnerable to large-scale failures. The same is true of the technologies that deliver coal, gas, and oil for running buildings, vehicles, and industries. Reliance on these delicately poised energy systems has unwittingly put at risk the entire American way of life. Lovins' detailed research shows that these vulnerabilities are increasingly being exploited. Brittle Power documents many significant assaults on energy facilities, other than during a war, in 40 countries and within the United States, in some 24 states. Resilient energy systems Lovins claims that most energy utilities and governments are unsuccessfully trying to build high technical reliability into power plants so large that their cost of failure is unacceptable. A resilient energy supply system may instead consist of numerous, relatively small sustainable energy sources, each with a low individual cost of failure. Potentially these individual energy source \\"are renewable: they harness the energy of sun, wind, water, or farm and forestry wastes, rather than that of depletable fuels\\". Central message Amory B. and L. Hunter Lovins reiterated the main message of Brittle Power in \\"Terrorism and Brittle Technology\\", Chapter 3 in Albert H. Teich's book Technology and the Future (2003): > The foundation of a secure energy system is to need less energy in the first > place, then to get it from sources that are inherently invulnerable because > they're diverse, dispersed, renewable, and mainly local. They're secure not > because they're American but because of their design. Any highly centralised > energy system ‚Äì pipelines, nuclear plants, refineries ‚Äì invites devastating > attack. But invulnerable alternatives don't, and can't, fail on a large > scale. Networked island-able microgrids In his book Reinventing Fire (2011), Amory B. Lovins puts forward a vision of networked island-able microgrids where energy is generated locally from solar power, wind power, and other resources, and used by super-efficient buildings. When each building, or neighborhood, is generating its own power, with links to other ‚Äúislands‚Äù of power, the security of the entire network is greatly enhanced. Lovins has said that in the face of hundreds of blackouts in 2005, Cuba reorganized its electricity transmission system into networked microgrids and cut the occurrence of blackouts to zero within two years, limiting damage even after two hurricanes. Denmark has performed tests of islanding a region (\\"cell\\") to maintain robustness with smaller local assets rather than large centralized ones.Lund, Per. \\"The Cell Controller Pilot Project \\" Energinet.dk, 12 October 2012.

The crustacean is endemic to the Illinois Sinkhole Plain of Monroe County and St. Clair County, in southwestern Illinois, including Illinois Caverns State Natural Area. Historically Gammarus acherondytes was known from six caves, but in a survey in 1995 the species was found at only three of the sites, with one further site inaccessible. This species occurs only in underground streams. It was first collected in 1938 and described as a new species in 1940. It has only been found in six cave streams, all lie within a 10-mile radius circle around Waterloo, Illinois, making this a very localized species. However, there is no evidence that these cave streams are currently interconnected. The main threat to the species is groundwater contamination. _Description_ Gammarus acherondytes is a rather small crustacean with its most notable features being the light gray-blue color of its exoskeleton, and rather small eyes and no sensory organs on its second antenna. _Range and Habitat_ Gammarus acherondytes is native to underground streams and waterways in Illinois. It has been recorded from five cave streams located in the Monroe and St.Clair counties. Fogelpole Cave, Illinois Caverns, Krueger-Dry Run Cave, Madonnaville Cave, and Pautler Cave in Monroe County. Along with Stemler Cave in St. Clair County. With Pautler Cave being closed down by the landowner. The largest population is recorded in the Illinois Caverns while no specimens were collected in Modannaville and Stemler Cave since 1986 and 1965 respectfully. Genetic evidence implies that none of these cave systems are interconnected due to the genomic pool of the populations being quite varied. _Threats and Conservation Efforts_ Human pollution and runoff is the main threat to the species. With chemical pollution being the major threat to quality of water where they reside. Although research shows that Gammarus acherondytes breed all year-round. With juveniles constituting more than 50% of the population and strongly influence population density. Giving reason to believe that if they are allowed to remain undisturbed the population could feasibly bounce back to pre-pollutant levels.

Species of Gammarus are the typical \\"scuds\\" of North America and range widely throughout the Holarctic. A considerable number are also found southwards into the Northern Hemisphere tropics, particularly in Southeast Asia.

It is endemic to four springs in Jeff Davis County and Reeves County, Texas, and is listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List. Description and ecology G. hyalelloides is the smallest freshwater amphipod in North America. Males are long, while sexually mature females are . They live in beds of Chara at the mouth of Phantom Lake Spring. G. hyalelloides makes up more than 70% of the diet of Gambusia nobilis in the Phantom Lake Spring refuge () in Jeff Davis County, Texas. Other biota found in the Phantom Lake Spring include the snails Pyrgulopsis texana and Lyrodes cheatumi. The absence of Hyalella azteca may have allowed speciation to take place in the genus Gammarus, with one species entering the vacant niche, and reducing in size to become G. hyalelloides. Taxonomic history The first collections of G. hyalelloides were made in 1967 at the Phantom Lake Spring. The amphipods were originally thought to be the common and widespread Hyalella azteca, but were later recognized as a new and distinct species of Gammarus. The type specimens were deposited in the United States National Museum (holotype male: USNM 151957; paratype female: USNM 151958). Further paratype series were deposited at the same museum, and at the National Museum of Canada. G. hyalelloides is part of the Gammarus pecos species complex, alongside Gammarus pecos and Gammarus desperatus; all three species are restricted to the Pecos River basin of Texas and New Mexico.

Carmen Weber met and married Ricardo Lagos in 1961, with whom he had two children: Ricardo and Ximena. After Lagos obtained his Ph.D. in the U.S., he annulled this marriage in 1969 (divorce was not legal in Chile until 2004.) He also obtained custody of his two children. The cause of the rupture was her severe bipolar disorder. She became famous during the run-up to the 1988 national plebiscite when she supported General Augusto Pinochet, and spoke negatively of her former husband during an interview that was aired on September 30 of that year. That interview was considered the single most damaging moment against the Pinochet option as Chileans perceived her as vindictive and bitter, and sympathy went to the husband rather than her. As a consequence of an accidental fire at her home on May 18, 2007, she suffered deep respiratory damage which eventually resulted in her serious injury. She died at her home in the city of Conc√≥n.

It is endemic to caves in the western United States. Description Glacicavicola bathyscioides is a shiny, translucent, brownish-orange, ant-like beetle, approximately 6 cm long by 2mm wide. It has become well-adapted to the troglobitic lifestyle: It has long thin antennae covered in fine setae, and slender legs (also covered in setae) which allow it to easily traverse the difficult terrain present in its environment. A particularly interesting feature of Glacicavicola bathyscioides is the absence of eyes, and the beetle is completely blind, even lacking optic neuropiles. Their abdomen exhibits false physogastry, which means that their abdomen appears larger than it truly is, due to the enlarged dome-like elytra which covers the entire abdomen. Biology Little is known about the biology Glacicavicola bathyscioides (the Western Blind Cave Beetle), due to its unique lifecycle and location. The beetles have been observed to feed on arthropod remains, as well as fungus, and it is speculated that they may eat bacteria as well. No larval form of the beetle has been observed. The beetles are suspected to have a lifecycle of around three years. Range The Western Blind Cave Beetle originally was discovered by Richard Westcott in Idaho lava tube ice caves along the eastern Snake River Plain of Idaho. It has since been discovered in similar localities, including a limestone cave in Wyoming. The beetles have been associated with humid, cold cave temperatures and ice, and they die when exposed to higher temperatures, which limits their distribution. image: Glacicavicola bathyscioidesTop.jpgDorsal Aspect image: Glacicavicola bathyscioidesVentral.jpgVentral Aspect image: Glacicavicola bathyscioidesLeft.jpgLeft View image: Glacicavicola bathyscioidesHead.jpgNote the lack of eyes ReferencesSources *World Conservation Monitoring Centre 1996.

While it is considered a terminal degree and requires coursework and research beyond the masters' level, the DCS is not considered equivalent to a Ph.D. or a Doctor of Science (D.Sc or Sc.D) in computer science.. Structure Typical entry requirements include master's degrees in computer science or a related field. The degree is intended for those who will make meaningful contributions to either the theory or practice of computing and as such involves both research and taught courses beyond master's degree level. Applied doctorates such as the DCS are aimed at practitioners with professional careers in the field rather than at those aiming for research careers in academia. The DCS is normally completed in three years, with a split of approximately two years of coursework and one year equivalent (36 credits out of a total of 96) spent on the dissertation. Relationship to the Ph.D. Structurally, the Doctor of Computer Science differs from the PhD in that the DCS has, as noted above, a three year duration, with only one year equivalent on the dissertation, while an American Ph.D. normally requires a minimum of four years, with at least three years spent on the dissertation. There are two active definitions of what comprises a research doctorate or similar in the U.S. The National Center for Education Statistics defines a Doctor's degree-research/scholarship as \\"A Ph.D. or other doctor's degree that requires advanced work beyond the master's level, including the preparation and defense of a dissertation based on original research, or the planning and execution of an original project demonstrating substantial artistic or scholarly achievement.\\" The awarding institution defines which degrees meet this description themselves. The National Science Foundation defines a research doctorate as \\"a doctoral degree that (1) requires completion of an original intellectual contribution in the form of a dissertation or an equivalent culminating project (e.g., musical composition) and (2) is not primarily intended as a degree for the practice of a profession.\\" Under this definition, the DCS, which (as noted above) is intended for professionals in the field of computer science, is not recognized by the National Science Foundation as a research doctorate equivalent to a Ph.D in Computer Science.

Division) was a unit of the Prussian/German Army.From the late 1800s, the Prussian Army was effectively the German Army, as during the period of German unification (1866-1871) the states of the German Empire entered into conventions with Prussia regarding their armies and only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous. It was formed on October 11, 1866, and was headquartered in Hannover.G√ºnter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815-1939.

Recruitment During the Franco-Prussian War, the division was a mixed unit, with Hannoverian, Brunswick and Westphalian elements. It was subsequently reorganized so that it was recruited primarily from the former Kingdom of Hannover, which had become the Prussian Province of Hanover after 1866, along with the Duchy of Brunswick.

Tattoo inks consist of pigments combined with a carrier, and are used in tattooing. Tattoo inks are available in a range of colors that can be thinned or mixed together to produce other colors and shades. Most professional tattoo artists purchase inks pre-made (known as pre-dispersed inks), while some tattooers mix their own using a dry pigment and a carrier. Tattoo Ink Carrier Chemistry: The Liquid Part of Tattoo Ink, Anne Marie Helmenstine, PhD Tattoo ink is generally permanent. Tattoo removal is difficult, painful, and the degree of success depends on the materials used. Recently developed inks claim to be comparatively easy to remove. Unsubstantiated claims have been made that some inks fade over time, yielding a \\"semi-permanent tattoo.\\"  Regulations  In the United States, tattoo inks are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as cosmetics and color additives. This regulatory authority is, however, not generally exercised. The FDA and medical practitioners have noted that many ink pigments used in tattoos are \\"industrial strength colors suitable for printers' ink or automobile paint\\". In California, Proposition 65 requires that Californians be warned before exposure to certain harmful chemicals;Metal Toxicity: Tattoos: Safe Symbols?, Environmental Health Perspectives, retrieved 19 October 2009 tattoo parlors in California must warn their patrons that tattoo inks contain heavy metals known to cause cancer, birth defects, and other reproductive harm.  Pigment bases  Manufacturers are not required to reveal their ingredients or conduct trials, and recipes may be proprietary. Professional inks may be made from iron oxides (rust), metal salts, or plastics.Tattoo Ink Chemistry, retrieved 19 October 2009 Homemade or traditional tattoo inks may be made from pen ink, soot, dirt, blood, or other ingredients. Heavy metals used for colors include mercury (red); lead (yellow, green, white); cadmium (red, orange, yellow); nickel (black); zinc (yellow, white); chromium (green); cobalt (blue); aluminium (green, violet); titanium (white); copper (blue, green); iron (brown, red, black); and barium (white). Metal oxides used include ferrocyanide and ferricyanide (yellow, red, green, blue). Organic chemicals used include azo-chemicals (orange, brown, yellow, green, violet) and naptha-derived chemicals (red). Carbon (soot or ash) is also used for black. Other elements used as pigments include antimony, arsenic, beryllium, calcium, lithium, selenium, and sulphur. Tattoo ink manufacturers typically blend the heavy metal pigments and/or use lightening agents (such as lead or titanium) to reduce production costs.  Carriers  A carrier acts as a solvent for the pigment, to \\"carry\\" the pigment from the point of needle trauma to the surrounding dermis. Carriers keep the ink evenly mixed and free from pathogens, and aid application. The most typical solvent is ethyl alcohol or distilled water, but denatured alcohols, methanol, rubbing alcohol, propylene glycol, and glycerine are also used. When an alcohol is used as part of the carrier base in tattoo ink or to disinfect the skin before application of the tattoo, it increases the skin's permeability, helping to transport more pigment into the skin.  Health concerns  A variety of medical problems, though uncommon, can result from tattooing. Medical workers have observed rare but severe medical complications from tattoo pigments in the body, and have noted that people acquiring tattoos rarely assess health risks prior to receiving their tattoos. A recent case report also showed that tattoo pigments migrate into lymph nodes. These can show up on some types of medical scans as tumors. One woman was given a complete hysterectomy only to find out later that the lymph nodes contained tattoo pigment. Other tattoo inks=Glow in the dark ink and blacklight ink Both blacklight and glow in the dark inks have been used for tattooing. Glow in the dark tattoo ink absorbs and retains light, and then glows in darkened conditions by process of phosphorescence. Blacklight ink does not glow in the dark, but reacts to non- visible UV light, producing a visible glow by fluorescence. The resulting glow of both these inks is highly variable. The safety of such inks for use on humans is widely debated in the tattoo community. The ingredients in some \\"glow\\" inks are listed as: (PMMA) Polymethylmethacrylate 97.5% and microspheres of fluorescent dye 2.5% suspended in UV sterilized, distilled water.  Removable tattoo ink  While tattoo ink is generally very painful and laborious to remove, tattoo removal being quite involved, a recently introduced ink has been developed to be easier to remove by laser treatments than traditional inks. Black henna Health Canada has advised against the use of \\"black henna\\" temporary tattoo ink which contains para-phenylenediamine (PPD), an ingredient in hair dyes. Black henna is normally applied externally in temporary Mehandi applications, rather than being inserted beneath the skin in a permanent tattoo. Another ink may be used instead of black henna. \\"Jagua\\", a fruit based ink proven to be a healthier alternative to black henna. Allergic reactions to PPD include rashes, contact dermatitis, itching, blisters, open sores, scarring and other potentially harmful effects. Vegan tattoo ink Various tattoo ink manufacturers also produce vegan-friendly inks that do not contain any animal by-products like bone char, glycerin, gelatin and shellac.

It is endemic to the United States and is the largest cricket in North America. Its natural habitat is temperate grassland. It is threatened by habitat loss, and is currently only found in Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Arkansas. Males of this species produce sounds by rubbing their fore wings together. They sing from special burrows they construct in the prairie soil to attract females for mating, and they can be heard at distances up to 400 m from the burrow. Males aggregate their acoustic burrows in a lek arena and are very sensitive to vibrations carried through the ground. Males communicate with neighboring males through vibrational signals, and the songs they project to flying females are harmonic chirps, rather than the trills produced by most mole crickets. Physiology The prairie mole cricket (Gryllotalpa major Saussure) is the largest of the North American crickets, measuring up to 5 cm long, weighing up to 2.6 g, and is typically brown to reddish-brown in color. Like other mole crickets (Gryllotalpidae), G. major has a bullet-shaped, heavy pronotum and large robust fore limbs used for digging complex burrows. Like other Orthoptera males, they have modified fore wings with a stridulatory apparatus which they use in conjunction with acoustic burrows to perform an acoustic sexual advertisement call to attract females during their brief mating season beginning in late spring. Females of G. major have similar stridulatory files as males, though smaller and weaker, and they are in fact capable of producing sound, though it seems the sound serves no function in other species sound production by females is linked to aggression and defense. In a study on the hearing sensitivity of G. major, researchers found that they have hearing sensitivities from 2 kHz to an ultrasonic range at 25 kHz. Distribution and habitat G. major is native to in tall grassland prairie ecosystems and occupies a small range in the southcentral United States, found only in Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. Prescribed burning is common throughout the prairie habitat of G. major and usually occurs during March and April, at the begging of the reproductive season of the cricket. Howard and Hill looked to the effect of these burning on the distribution of G. major and found that recent burned land can be beneficial to the cricket and provide some advantages to mating behaviours. G. major has been observed calling on recently burned sites within 24 hours of the site being burned. The warmer soil as a result of the fire is thoughr ro have metabolic advantages for the cricket, allowing them to increase their chirp frequency, and overall the burned land allows their song to travel more efficiently, increasing to attraction of females to the area. The belowground grass biomass on which the cricket feeds remains intact after a burn, and no evidence of direct mortality of the cricket has been documented. The grass height of the prairie land has a marked effect on the male burrows in a lek. They found that as grass height increased, the spacing between each burrow also increased, as well as an increase in the angle of opening to the burrow. This behavior may have evolved as response to the dynamic disturbances of tallgrass prairie ecosystems. Mating behaviour The males of G. major build an acoustic burrow in prairie soil arranged in a lek-like arena and perform an acoustic sexual advertisement call for the female of the species by singing from these calling chambers while the female flies overhead, making her choice. The call males produce is a loud, long-range, airborne song consisting of a pattern of long chirps with a frequency of 2 kHz and up to five harmonics, and these songs can be heard up to 400 m away. The female flies at a height of 1.5-5.0 m above the lek, assessing each individual male presumably based on the attractiveness of the male call and the position of the male within the lek arena. Females can detect male signals from up to 76 m away and usually arrive within 20 minutes. Once the female selects an appropriate male, she drops down, landing 3‚Äì5 m from the chosen male's burrow and uses phonotaxis to find her way; once there, she enters the burrow, mates with the male, and goes on her way. Though the female is expected to choose the male closer to the arena due to the decrease predation risk among the males, the female choice of males appears to be randomly spread across the lek with the more attractive males being located further from the center and farther from the nearest calling neighbor. The preference from more isolated males could be a way of maximizing fitness, as these males are able to maintain costly display territory with increased predation risk. Research into the mating behaviour of G. major found they fit the three main criteria of a classical lek system. Males serve no role in parental care, other than fertilizing female eggs, they die soon after mating season, and do not tend to the eggs or young in any way. Males create lek-like arenas of evenly positioned burrows, and the females are free to fly over to make their choice without male influence, for example sequestering resources or forcing copulation upon the female. So, G. major fits within a slightly modified definition of a lek system, modified only to adjust for an insect species and broaden the typical umbrella classification. While singing males of G. major produce vibrations which travel through the soil, influencing neighboring males which are able to distinguish these ground vibrations from other background vibrations. These singing vibrations can travel up to 3 m in the soil depending on conditions, and the energy ranges from 30 to 300 Hz. They also found that males do not alter their calls in response to the airborne calls of other males, but rather some do respond to the ground vibrations of others and may abandon and relocate their burrows to a more optimal position. The call of G. major is unique among crickets as they use a chirp rather than a trill to attract females. This chirp was analyzed and found that certain aspects of the chirp can be correlated to the morphology of the individual cricket. Overall, longer males produced a lower-frequency call that contained more syllables per chirp, though these males did not necessarily produce a louder call. Within the lekking arena, males of G. major are in close proximity to each other and are thought to exhibit some influence on neighboring males. While males do sound louder on nights when more males are calling, individual males did not increase their maximum call volume with increased competition from other males, nor did they increase their volume due to the availability of female. No correlation was found in volume and the distance to an individual males nearest neighbor, nor a correlation with the density of the population. Males had a strong correlation between the temperature of the soil and their chirp rate due to an increase in metabolic energy, and also a correlation was found between the number of harmonics produced by a male and the distance to that male‚Äôs closest neighbor. Individual calling males are influenced more by their nearest one or two closest neighbors than by the group as a whole. Phylogeny A study into the phylogenetic relationship of Gryllotalpidae cricket grouped G. major in a group with Gryllotalpa devia, Gryllotalpa pilosopes, and Gryllotalpa inermis due to the dorsal hind tibiae lacking subapical spurs. Species status  In the late 1980s, G. major was recommended to be placed under protected status as a threatened species, but a lack of ecological information has stalled protection efforts. The IUCN Red List calls the species data deficient, as more data on the habitat and effects of decreased tallgrass prairie land on the cricket‚Äôs population are needed. NatureServe has G. major listed as G3 ‚Äì vulnerable due to scattered populations and habitat loss.NatureServe 2015. Gryllotalpa major. NatureServe Explorer Version 7.1. Accessed 21 February 2016.

He worked for Rhythm and Hues Studios until 2013. His hometown is Brookfield, Connecticut, where he graduated from Brookfield High School in 1986. He then earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from Bucknell University in 1990. Westenhofer also received his Masters at the George Washington University School of Engineering and Applied Science in 1995, where he studied the use of dynamics in physically based animation. In 1994, he joined Rhythm & Hues as a technical director, and Westenhofer‚Äôs lighting and effects animation work was featured in Batman Forever and numerous commercials. He was promoted to CG supervisor for Speed 2: Cruise Control, and continued in that role for Spawn, Mouse Hunt, Kazaam and Waterworld.http://www.rhythm.com/features/vfx-supervisors/bill-westenhofer/ His other VFX supervisor credits include Elf, The Rundown, Stuart Little 2, Men in Black II, Cats & Dogs, Along Came a Spider, Frequency, Stuart Little, and Babe: Pig in the City. In 2005, Westenhofer supervised a team of 400 digital artists on The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. Later he would win both the BAFTA and the Academy Award for the 2007 release The Golden Compass, and 2012's Life of Pi in 2013. During the Academy Awards, when Westenhofer brought up Rhythm and Hues' financial issues during his speech, the microphone was cut off, which prompted many protests by the visual effects industry. He had intended to say: > \\"What I was trying to say up there is that at a time when visual effects > movies are dominating the box office, visual effects companies are > struggling,\\" Westenhofer told reporters. \\"And I wanted to point out that we > aren't technicians. Visual effects is not just a commodity that's being done > by people pushing buttons. We're artists, and if we don't find a way to fix > the business model, we start to lose the artistry. If anything, 'Life of Pi' > shows that we're artists and not just technicians.\\" Westenhofer also worked as VFX supervisor for Wonder Woman, released in June 2017.
