According to art. 20a OCA contracts shall have the force of a law for the parties that have concluded them.  I. General Part  Contract  In Bulgaria the contract is one of the prerequisites for the development of obligatory relations. The term contract refers to a bilateral legal transaction, which consists of two declarations of intent (offer and acceptance) hat must be linked to each other and match in their contents. A contract is considered concluded from the moment in which the acceptance reaches the offeror (art. 14 OCA). The parties conclude the contract, because they have as their object the occurrence of certain legal consequences. In accordance with art. 9 OCA. the parties may determine the content of the contract insofar as it does not contravene the mandatory provisions of the law and good morals. In Bulgaria, the separation principle and the abstraction principle do not apply. In contracts for the transfer of ownership to generically certain things, ownership passes when the goods are determined by agreement between the parties and in the absence of such agreements - at handover. As for ownership transfer contracts and contracts of establishing or transferring some other property right over a specific chattel, the transfer or the establishment shall occur by virtue of the contract itself and shall not require that the chattel be delivered. (according to art. 24 OCA). = Form of Contract = The OCA provides that contracts of ownership transfer and those of establishing other property rights on immovable property must be executed through a notarial deed.  Invalidity  Contracts that violate legal requirements or show other legal deficits are invalid. Regarding invalid contracts, there are two subgroups to distinguish: void contracts and voidable contracts. = Voidable contracts = Initially, voidable contracts are contract that are valid and binding unless avoided or declared void by a party to them on the grounds prescribed by the law. General legal provisions regarding these grounds are provided in the Bulgarian Obligations and Contracts Act (OCA); specific legal provisions are (inter alia) contained in the Family code, the Law on Protection of Competition and the Inheritance law. Invalidation may be claimed only by the party in whose interest the law allows such invalidation. A contract subject to invalidation may be ratified by the party entitled to demand its invalidation, by way of an instrument in writing which should indicate the grounds for invalidation. A contract shall also be ratified where the party entitled to demand its invalidation voluntarily performs it, in whole or in part, being aware of the grounds for invalidation. A contract which is subject to invalidation on grounds of extreme necessity may not be ratified. According to art. 27 OCA a contract may be subject to invalidation of the following grounds: * Legal incapacity – if a contract is concluded by incapable persons or by their representatives not respecting the specific legal provisions for representation; * According to Article 28 of the Act, a material mistake may cause the cancellation of the contract. If the contract has been concluded with regard to a specific person being one of the parties to it (intuitu personae) a mistake concerning this person may render the contract void. * Fraud - According to Article 29 of the Act, a fraud may cause the cancellation of the contract under the condition that one party has been deceived maliciously to enter into the contractual relationship. If the fraud has been induced by a third party, the deceived party may request the cancellation of the contract if the other party knew or ought to have known of the fraud. * A contract may be cancelled if one of the contracting parties concluded the contract out of reasonable fear induced by threats from the other party or third person. * Incapacity to comprehend one's own actions - If a person capable of acting is enabled to comprehend his own actions while concluding a contract, the contract may be cancelled. * Stringent necessity - The contract is voidable as well if it has been concluded under stringent necessity and under apparently unfavorable conditions for one of the parties. The court may cancel the contract completely or in the future. If the other party offers to compensate the damages, the contract may remain in force. = Void contracts = According to the concept of void contracts used by the Bulgarian lawmakers these contracts should be regarded as if they had never been concluded. The void contracts are those which have no legal effect because of their defectiveness from their conclusion and where a conformation is usually not possible. Contracts contravening or circumventing the law, as well as contracts infringing good morals, including contracts on inheritance that does not exist as yet, shall be null and void. Null and void shall also be those contracts that have an impossible subject, as well as the contracts which lack either consent or a form prescribed by law, or grounds. Fictitious contracts are also null and void. The grounds shall be presumed to exist until otherwise proved. = Partial invalidity = The invalidity of few clauses does not render the entire contract void given that the clauses may be replaced by binding prescriptions of the law or if the transaction is supposed to have been concluded even without the void clauses. If the contract is declared invalid, each party must pay back what he has received from the other party. = Reinterpretation = If an invalid contract complies with the requirements of another legal transaction, the former is valid and considered transformed in the latter given that the parties would have agreed to conclude the latter.  Representation  The representation is governed by art. 36-43 OCA. The Representation is a legal institution referring to legal actions of one person (agent) on behalf of another (principal) whereby the principal has to bear the consequences resulting from the agent's legal actions. here are two forms of representation to be distinguished: voluntary representation – here, the representation is wanted and organized by the principal; and the second form is obligatory representation imposed by the law – in this case the law itself requires representation by certain persons. = Formation = * declaration of intent made by a private person: \\\\- from the principal's unilateral declaration of intent (authorisation), e.g. his last will \\\\- a contract. * Formation of representation power by an enactment: \\\\- If the representation power arises from an administrative act, e.g. if the administrative act is appointed by a guardian that hereby obtains actual authority \\\\- from a court decision \\\\- from a child's birth (parents obtain the actual authority for their child). = Preconditions for a successful representation = # The agent must deliver an own declaration of intent. To guarantee the declaration of intent delivered by the agent, he must be capable of acting. # The agent must deliver the declaration of intent in the name of the principal. He must make obvious that he is acting in someone else's name. # The agent must have powers of representation and act within these powers. If the agent and the person he negotiates with reach an agreement to the detriment of the principal, the contract shall not be binding on the latter. If several persons have been authorised to exercise the same right to act, each of them may perform the act by himself unless something else is provided by the authorisation. # In several cases, where strictly personal legal actions are required (marriages, wills etc.) agency is inadmissible as in these cases the legal actions are decided by the personal estimation of the person. = Termination = The representation is cancelled in the following cases: * with the death of the agent or principal; * with the dissolution of the legal entity; * with the incapacitation of the agent or principal; * with the withdrawal of the representation powers; * with the adoption; * regarding the guardianship over persons placed under disability: with the cancellation of the guardianship etc.  Default = Debtor’s default = If for the performance of an obligation a time limit has been fixed, the debtor is in default when he is unable to meet the obligation within this time limit. If there is no date fixed for the performance, the debtor is in default after the creditor's request for performance. If the obligation arose due to a tort action, the default for the payment of the damages occurs without a request, from the date of the tort. If the debtor is in default, he must pay damages even if the performance becomes impossible for reasons for which he is not responsible unless he can prove that the creditor would have suffered the loss/damage also in case of a timely performance. The damages due to a default encompass the suffered damages as well as any lost profit, provided that the suffered damage is directly linked to the default and the profit could be expected under the contract. If the debtor did not act in good faith, he is liable for all direct and indirect damages. = Creditor’s default = According to Article 95 of the law of obligations and contracts, the creditor defaults if he does not accept the delivery/performance offered by the debtor or if he does not cooperate when this is required for the fulfillment of the obligation.  Transfer of claim = Assignment = According to Article 99 of the Bulgarian law of obligations and contracts, a creditor may transfer his claims, provided that neither the law, a contract or the nature of the claim dictates otherwise. he transferred claim including the prerogatives, the remuneration and all other additions as well as the accrued interest passes on to the new creditor, unless something else is appointed. The old creditor must inform the debtor about the transfer of claim and hand over all present documents regarding the claim to the new creditor. Besides, the creditor must confirm the transfer in writing. The transfer is effective regarding third parties and the debtor from the day that the debtor gets informed by the old creditor. Regarding the transfer of claim for consideration, the old creditor is liable for the validity of the claim at the time of the transfer. The old creditor is only liable for the debtor's ability to pay if he pledged himself to and only to the amount that he obtained by transferring the claim. = Stepping in as co-debtor = With the approval of creditor and/or debtor, an obligation may also be joined by a third person as co- debtor. If the creditor agreed to the joining, it may not be cancelled or modified without his consent. The principal debtor and the co-person are jointly and severally liable toward the creditor. The debtor may be substituted by third parties only with the explicit consent of the creditor. The substituted debtor is relieved from the liability towards the creditor. The securities given by third parties expire if they do not agree on serving the new creditor. Pledges and mortgages that have been given to the first creditor remain effective. The new debtor may plead against the creditor any defenses of the former debtor arising from the transferred legal relationship.  Unlawful Acts  The definition of the term unlawful acts can be derived from art. 45 OCA – if a person causes guiltily damage to another person, they must redress it. In all cases of tort guilt is presumed until proven otherwise. This provision applies to all natural persons. The legal entities are liable in accordance with art. 49 OCA as principal. The subject of the tort act must be a person with legal capacity to be held liable for tort action. That is why A person lacking the capacity to understand or control his actions shall not be liable for the damage he has caused while in such a state unless he himself has faultily caused his lack of capacity (47 OCA). The legal capacity shall be evaluated in each particular case – for majors as well as for minors. In cases of self- defence the liability is excluded. It is supposed that the tortfeasor's actions are not unlawful per se. However, in cases of stringent necessity, the created damage has to be repaired – even if the actions were not culpable, the result is unlawful. The OCA provides for several cases of liability in case of unlawful acts: = Responsibility of persons with legal duty to care for incapable persons = The person with legal duty to care for incapable persons (e.g. teachers) is liable for damage caused by the person unable to act, unless the occurrence of the damage could not have been prevented. = Responsibility of parents (art. 48 OCA) = Parents and adoptive parents that exercise parental rights are liable for the damage caused by their minor children living with them. The guardian is liable for damage caused by his ward living with him. The above-mentioned persons are not liable if they were unable to prevent the occurrence of the damage. = Responsibility of the principal = The principal is liable for the damage caused by his commissary while performing the imposed work. This legal provision is not applicable regarding contracts for work – there the person performing the work is personally liable. The principal may exercise his right on action for recourse/claim towards the commissary. = Responsibility for damage caused by items = The owner and supervisor of items are jointly and severally liable for damage caused by items of any kind. If the damage was caused by animals, the owner/supervisor is liable even if the animal ran away or got lost. Dangerousness per se or other specific characteristics of the item are not required. The owner and the supervisor are liable regardless of their personal fault; their behaviour must not be unlawful or culpable. If they prove that the damage was caused by a force majeure, by actions of third parties or by the actions of the aggrieved party, they do not carry responsibility.  Unjustified enrichment  A person is obliged to return whenever that person has obtained something without legal basis or if the legal basis did not occur or has ceased later on (art. 55). What has been performed regarding moral obligations may not be claimed back. = Return = If a specific item is to be returned the recipient owes its yields as well at the time of the request. If the item that is to be returned vanishes after the request or if the recipient affected the item or used it up, knowing that he owns it without legal basis or, if the revenues he obtained from the item were higher, he is obligated to pay compensation. If the item has vanished, has been affected or used up before the time of the request, the recipient only has to compensate what he availed excluding the yields. Where restitution is owed by a person of legal incapacity only what has been used to his benefit may be claimed from him. Excluding the cases named above, each person that obtained something from someone without legal basis must pay the enrichment until the state of impoverishment. This right is justified if no other claim to defend the impoverished person is present. = Repayment of another person’s obligation in accordance with art. 56 OCA = If a person pays another person's obligation by mistake, he has the right to claim it back from the creditor unless the latter one renounced the document or repayment of the obligation in good faith. In the latter case, the person that paid the obligation receives the creditor's rights.  Offsetting  If two persons owe each other money or similar and replaceable goods, it is possible for them to offset/to balance their mutual outstanding debts with each other under condition of maturity and solvency of both debts. The counterparty must be notified about the offsetting. When making an offset of a claim no time limits or conditions may be imposed, except for the condition that the offsetting shall be taken into account only in case the claim is brought to court. The two reciprocal claims shall be considered as extinct to the amount of the lower one as of the day on which the offsetting could have been made. The offsetting is also possible after prescription of one of the claims, if it would have been admissible before the expiry of the limitation period. If the debtor agreed to an assignment of the debt, he may not offset his obligation with the assigned one regarding his old creditor. Claims that are not subject to forcible execution and claims ensuing from wilful wrongful acts and claims for taxes cannot be set-off without the creditor's consent.  Reconsideration (art. 107 OCA)  If the debt is renewed with another one with the creditor's consent, the debt may be reconsidered. In these instances, the securities of the old debt remain in force if their providers have given their consent.  Waiver  The claim may be waived if the creditor renounces his claim by a contract with the debtor.  Limitation  The term „limitation“ describes a specific time period, after whose expiry the legal entity loses the right to assert and legally enforce his claims. = Limitation periods = The limitation period starts with the maturity of the claim. If agreed that the claim becomes due after request, the limitation period starts with the moment that the liability has been stated. Regarding tortious compensation claims, the limitation period starts from the point in time of acquiring knowledge of the offender. Regarding compensation claims on grounds of default, the limitation period starts with the day that the contractual penalty has been calculated. The general rules concerning the limitation are contained in the Bulgarian law of obligations and contracts but there exist special regulations providing shorter limitation periods and other regulations that differ from the general rules: * 5-year limitation period – according to art. 110 after the expiry of 5 years, all claims without legally provided limitation period prescribe; * 3-year limitation period - According to Article 111 of the law, the following claims prescribe after 3 years have passed: (a) claims derived from an employment relationship, if there is no other limitation period provided; (b) damage compensation claims and contractual penalties in case of non- performance of a contract; (c) claims derived from tenancies, interests and other regular payments; * 1-year limitation period - Regarding sales of immovable property with defects, the limitation period is one year as well; * 6-month limitation period - A limitation period of 6 months is provided regarding claims for defects of movable property and other claims provided by the commercial law. Agreements regarding a shortening or extension of fixed limitation periods as well as such regarding the renunciation of the limitation before it expired, are ineffective. = Suspension of the limitation period = The time between the occurrence of reasons for the suspension and their disappearance is not included, hence the remaining limitation period continues. The limitation period is suspended: * between children and their parents whereby parents exercise their parental rights; * between guardian and child for the duration of the guardianship; * between spouses; * regarding claims of persons whose assets are administrated by law or by an order of the court, against the administrator during the time of administration; * regarding claims for damages of legal entities against their manager during the time of their appointment; * regarding claims raised by minors or mentally immature persons for the time that they do not have a legal representative or guardian and 6 months starting from the time that a guardian has been appointed or the legal incapacity has been fixed; * for the duration of a trial regarding the claim. = Interruption of the limitation period = If a limitation period has been interrupted, a new limitation period begins. If the claim has been defined by the court, the limitation period is always 5 years. The limitation is interrupted when the debtor's claim is approved; when an action has been brought to court or in case of an appeal against the conciliation procedure; if the action or the appeal has been dismissed, the limitation period is uninterrupted; when enforcement procedure has been started. What has been performed to fulfil a claim barred by the statute of limitation cannot be reclaimed even if it has been performed due to ignorance of the limitation.  Joint several liability  Joint several liability exists when two or more parties are liable for one obligation. The creditor can demand the obligation in full amount from either party but he has only one cause of action. The persons who are liable for the obligation are called joint several debtors. The joint several liability is settled in art. 121 – 127 from the Obligations and Contracts Act (OCA). Joint liability can come into being: * by law; * from a contract (e.g. in case of a guarantee contract the guarantor undertakes an obligation before another's creditor to be liable for the performance of the other's obligation) = Effects of the joint several liability = The absolute effect means that one juristic act affects all joint several debtors in the same way. For example, the creditor can demand the obligation in full amount from either party. The performance from one several liability debtor affects also the others and the creditor cannot refuse it without being in default. In this case the creditor will be in default towards all joint several liability debtors. The autonomy of the different obligations undertaken by the joint several liability debtors is the reason for one juristic act that affects some of the obligations not have any effect on the others. This hypothesis is described by the term “relative effect of the joint several liability”. The obligations of the joint several debtors might have different due dates. As a rule the default of the debtor worsens his financial situation. That is why the default of one of the joint several liability debtors does not have any harmful consequences for the others. Another rule that can describe the relative effect of the joint several liability is that when the performance becomes impossible and only one of the debtors is responsible for that, the creditor may claim from the latter full damages. The limitation period also have a relative effect. If one of the joint several liability debtors to have performed in full amount to the creditor for him to have a regress claim against his co-debtors but only for him to have paid more than his share.  Guarantee  The guarantee agreement obliges the guarantor to be personally responsible for the fulfillment of obligations/liabilities of the main debtor. The guarantee has to be confirmed in writing. Subject of the guarantee can be only existing obligations. It may be issued for parts of the debtor's obligation or under more favorable conditions. The guarantor and the main debtor are jointly liable. The guarantor remains obliged under the given guarantee if the creditor has claimed payment from the debtor within 6 months after the due date of payment.  Pledge  In Bulgaria it is possible that for safeguarding a claim, a pledge is created on movable property or the claim itself. The right of pledge is an accessory right – it appears and disappears with the transfer of the safeguarded claim. = Pledge on movable property = The pledge agreement is only effective if the pledged object is handed over to the creditor. The only obligation of the creditor is to store the pledged object until the full repayment of the secured claim. He may not benefit from the pledge, unless there is an agreement for that. = Pledge on claims = Only claims that are able to be transferred may be pledged. The contract of pledge regarding a claim may not be set against third parties if the pledge has not been displayed towards the debtor. The pledger is obliged to hand over the documents verifying the pledged claims (if existing) to the pledge. The creditor is obliged to perform any necessary actions serving its maintenance, e.g. collecting the interest and also the principal sum.  Mortgage  According to Article 149 of the Bulgarian Obligations and Contracts Act, a mortgage on real property may be established to secure a claim. According to Article 149 of the Bulgarian law of obligations and contracts, a mortgage on real property may be established to secure a claim. = Creation of the mortgage = The mortgage shall be created through registration in the Property Register on the grounds of a contract or by operation of law. It may be established only on separately specified properties and for a specific sum of money. A mortgage by operation of law: # in favour of the alienator of immovable property - on the alienated property as security for his claims under the contract, and # in favour of the co-partitioners to whom a supplementing of the share is due - on immovable property left in the share of a co-partitioner who is liable for the supplementing of the share. The creation of a mortgage is invalid if either the mortgage contract or the application for creation of a mortgage by operation of law or the deed pursuant to which it is filed does not specify the identity of the creditor or the owner or the debtor, or does not specify the identity of the property or the secured claim or the amount of the sum the mortgage is created for. A creditor whose claim is secured by a mortgage is entitled to be satisfied preferentially from the mortgaged property's price, whoever its owner might be. The right to a preferential satisfaction also applies to the income from the property from the date on which the owner must give account of such income under forcible execution pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure. = Deletion of the mortgage = The deletion of a mortgage is only possible with the creditor's consent – in a notarized form, or on the basis of an effective court ruling. The deletion shall be made upon an application with the deed of consent or a copy of the effective court ruling attached thereto. It shall be made through entering a note in the lot of the mortgaged property. The deletion extinguishes the mortgage.  II. Special Part  Purchase  With the conclusion of a purchase contract, the seller obligates himself to transfer property or rights to the purchaser; the purchaser obligates himself to pay the agreed amount of money. The expenses related to the contract and all costs related to the transfer of the property are to be borne by the purchaser, except the purchase of estates where the expenses are divided equally. The risk of accidental loss passes to the purchaser upon the moment that the parties agreed upon the goods resp. upon the moment of transfer. = Obligations of the seller = The seller is obliged to transfer the sold property/right to the purchaser. In the moment of the sale, the property must be transferred including its yields. = Sale of an object resp. an object for which third parties have rights = If third parties own property rights or other rights on the respective object which may be displayed towards the purchaser (who did not know about these rights), the seller is liable. If the sold object belongs completely to the ownership of a third party, the purchaser is entitled to dissolve the sale according to the regulations of Article 87 of the Bulgarian Obligations and Contracts Act. = The seller’s liability for defects = The seller is liable for defects in the sold object that substantially reduce the value or the suitability for its required use. The seller is also liable if the defect was unknown to him. Any agreements that exempt the seller from his liability are void. = The purchaser’s rights regarding the liability for defects = In cases that the seller is liable according to Article 139 of the law of obligations and contracts, the purchaser may return the object and demand the reimbursement of the price paid and of the expenses related to the sale. Regarding the non-performance of the obligations, he is entitled to a claim for compensation according to the general provisions. = The purchaser’s obligations = The purchaser is obliged to pay the agreed price and to receive the object. The payment is to be made in the moment and at the place that the object is transferred. If the sold object produces yields or other revenues, the purchaser owes interest on the price from the day of the transfer, even if the price is not due.  Donation  The donation is a bilateral contract with the immediate and gratuitous assignment of an object performed by the giver in favour of the donee (who must accept the donation). = Types of contracts = There are 3 types of donation contracts to be distinguished: # indifferent donation – usual case, # donation by obligation – due to moral obligations, # donation by decency. The significance of this division becomes apparent in respect of the donation's revocation: Donations made due to moral obligations or decency may not be revoked. = Formal requirements = According to Article 226 OCA, the promise of donation is not binding – consequently, pre-contracts regarding donations are void. Concerning the formal requirements, there are two types of donations to be distinguished: the formal donation and the donation issued by hand (resp. Article 225 (2) of the law of obligations and contracts). Regarding the donation of real estate, the validity requires a notarial certification; regarding the donation of mobility the form is eased: only the notarial certification of the signatures is required; regarding the donation of securities, the respective form of transfer must be maintained. = Revocation of donations = The revocation of donations due to ingratitude of the donee is provided in Article 227 OCA.  Lease  With the conclusion of a rental/lease agreement according to Bulgarian law, the lessor obligates himself to provide a property to the lessee for temporary use, and the lessee undertakes to pay him a certain price. The rules regarding lease agreements are enshrined in the Obligations and Contracts Act, in Articles 228 to 239. = Lease of property = The lease agreement concerning property is an informal contractual agreement under OCA. It may have movable and immovable property as subject. Unless otherwise agreed, the lessor is bound to hand over the property in a state which is appropriate to the use it has been leased for and maintain this state for the duration of the contract. = Term of lease = According to Bulgarian law, the lease agreement may not be signed for a period longer than 10 years, unless it is a commercial transaction. = Maintenance and repair = The lessor is obligated to hand over the leased object in a state suitable for the contractually agreed use and to maintain this state during the lease time. Aside, he must repair of all damages if they are not faultily caused by the lessee and do not result from the normal usage. = End of the lease relationship = he lease agreement may be terminated on several grounds. The first group encompass the general civil law termination grounds: upon mutual consent of the contracting parties; termination due to a contractual breach by one of the parties; due to objective impossibility of performance, etc. Article 236 of OCA provides the expiration of the term as ground for the termination of timely limited rental relationships.  Loan  With the conclusion of a loan contract according to Bulgarian law, the lender obliges to put a specific amount of money or replaceable goods at the borrower's disposal. The borrower obliges to return the amount of money or goods in the same kind, amount and quality. The loan contract is a unilateral gratuitous actual contract. The borrower must pay interest only if he obliged himself to this by a written agreement. = Effects of the contract = The borrower's primary obligation is to return the money/goods.  Loan agreement  With the loan agreement, the lender obligates himself gratuitously to the borrower one chattel for temporary use and the borrower assumes the obligation to return it. The loan is an intuito personae agreement – the lender's personality is essential. = Contract Effects = The borrower must take due care of the chattel, giving higher priority to its preservation than to the preservation of his own belongings. Furthermore, he is obligated to use the object as contractually agreed and may not (unless something else has been agreed upon) hand it to third parties. = End of the contract = The loan agreement may be concluded for a specific period and is terminated with its expiration. Same applies accordingly if the contract has been concluded for a specific purpose. If the duration of the contract is not determined by a certain period of time or a specific purpose, the lender may claim the object back at any time.  Contract for manufacture  With the conclusion of a contract for manufacture, the contractor obliges to perform a work at own risk; the customer obliges to pay the agreed remuneration. If not agreed otherwise, the contractor is obliged to perform the work on his own account. The contract for manufacture is always a legal relationship in return for payment. = Obligations and rights of the contractor = If not agreed otherwise, the contractor is obligated to perform the work on his own account. The contractor is obligated to perform the work in a way that it is suitable to its usual or contractually provided use. The contractor that performs the work using his own material is liable for its quality. The person ordering the work is entitled to check the performance of the contract at any time, provided he does not disturb the contractor. = Rights and obligations of the customer = The main obligations of the customer are to pay the contractor and to accept the work suitable to its contractually provided use. = Non- fulfillment = If it turns out that the contractor will not perform the work within the time limit or in the agreed or proper way, the customer is entitled to withdraw from the contract and to request damages according to the general rules. In cases of deviations from the agreed condition or defects of the work, the customer is entitled to: * demand a gratuitous supplementary performance within an adequate period of time; * demand the reimbursement of costs that arose with the rework or the reduction of the remuneration. In cases of significant deviations from the agreed condition or defects that unfit the work for the usual usage or the contractually provided purpose, the customer is entitled to cancel the contract.  Mandate contract  The commissioner assumes the obligation to perform on behalf of the client the acts for which he is commissioned by the client (art. 280). The mandate is a unilateral and, according to its definition, gratuitous contract. Though, it is possible payment to be agreed (resp. article 286 of OCA). = Rights and obligations of the parties = According to Article 281 of OCA, the commissioner shall perform the mandate with due diligence and shall protect the property received in connection therewith. The mandatary must provide an account to the mandator and deliver to him everything he has received in the performance of the mandate. Generally, no specific form is required – only if the order regards the acquisition of property rights on real estate, the contract must be concluded in written form and the signatures must be notary certified. = Termination of the mandate = Being related to the personality of the parties, the mandate is terminated with the decease or the legal incapacity of one of the parties or with the dissolution of the legal person of the client or commissioner. Other grounds for the termination of the mandate are the withdrawal of the mandate by the client, the rejection by the commissioner and the general termination grounds regulated under the law.

He is now Chairman of the charity MapAction. Early life Educated at The King's School, Canterbury and Imperial College London, Press graduated in Mining Geology in 1970 with underground experience in nickel, copper and lead-zinc mines. He worked briefly in geochemical exploration before commencing postgraduate work at Imperial on the potential applications of remote sensing for geological exploration, in anticipation of the launch of the first civilian earth observation satellites. Specifically, this focussed on the possible detection of the toxic effects of soil-bound heavy metals on vegetation as a mineral exploration tool.Press, Nigel (1974). Detecting the Toxic Effects of Metals on Vegetation from Earth Observation Satellites. London: Journal of the British Interplanetary Society.Press, Nigel (1974). Remote Sensing to Detect the Toxic Effects of Metals on Vegetation for Mineral Exploration. London: Nigel Press Associates [NPA]. Career In 1972, Press founded Nigel Press Associates Ltd (NPA) to continue his research in the commercial arena with an emphasis on structural mapping and photogeology. During the 1970s, in conjunction with Dutch geologist Dr. Wim Kampschuur, the Tectosat Exploration System was developed,Kampschuur, Wim and Press, Nigel (1977). The Direct Relationship of Features Interpreted from Landsat Imagery to Plate Tectonic Concepts in the Atlantic Region: Its Significance in Hydrocarbon Exploration. Proceedings of the AAPG Pecora III Symposium, Sioux Falls, November 1977. using brittle fracture patterns found on satellite imagery as a means of better understanding mechanisms and consequences of plate tectonics. Studies were undertaken on a continent-wide scale throughout Europe (including the Greenland-Norwegian basin), Africa, Arabia and parts of India, linking extensive, specially collected field data to satellite interpretation. The studies were subscribed to by most of the world’s major oil companies as well as mining companies and international organisations such as UNDP. These studies formed the foundation on which further interpretation has been made worldwide by NPA Satellite Mapping (now CGG) up to the present day. During this period, NPA became the leading commercial supplier of imagery from different satellite sources and the go-to supplier for photo-mosaicked images, and later, digitally processed images and mosaics - a forerunner service to today’s Google Earth. With the advent of the European Space Agency's radar satellites in the early 1990s, Press, in conjunction with Dr Geoff Lawrence, led NPA to develop Offshore Basin Screening using sea surface roughness patterns observed on radar imagery to detect slicks caused by traces of hydrocarbons seeping from the sea floor.Press, Nigel and Lawrence, Geoff (1995). Offshore Basin Screening from ERS Satellite. European Space Agency. This technique has become a universally recognised complimentary data source to seismic surveying and other offshore exploration tools, and is used by most of the world’s major oil companies who draw on a global database compiled and maintained by CGG-NPA. Growing availability of satellite radar during the 1990s led Press to focus NPA on developing methods using interferometric principles to detect small amounts of ground surface movement that remain difficult to survey with ground-based techniques. The ability to measure millimetric-level surface changes due to both geological and anthropogenic effects introduced a new dimension to environmental studies in disciplines ranging from earthquake and volcano studies to groundwater and oil extraction and engineering geology.Aldiss, Don, et al, (2013). Geological Interpretation of Current Subsidence and Uplift in the London Area, UK, as shown by High Precision Satellite-based Surveying. It is now widely applied by CGG-NPA in monitoring projects such as fracking extraction, pipelines and transportation tunnelling. Much of this work was originally done as collaborative research projects with the British National Space Centre (BNSC, now UK Space), the European Space Agency, the Joint Research Centre and latterly under EU Framework Program for Research and Technological Development and Copernicus Programme. NPA, with project manager Ren Capes, conceived and led the ESA Terrafirma Project and the EU PanGeo Project. Press was instrumental in founding British Association of Remote Sensing Companies (BARSC) and served several terms as Chair. He was an advisor to the DG of BNSC and an Executive Member of The Parliamentary Space Committee. Press is a Fellow of The Geological Society of London and of The Royal Geographical Society. In 2008, Press sold NPA to Fugro, who in turn sold NPA to CGG when they divested of their Geological exploration activities in 2012. Press is no longer directly involved in the activities of CGG-NPA. Press has been involved with MapAction since its inception in the late 1990s in the wake of the Bosnia crisis; one of MapAction’s first volunteers was an NPA employee and NPA provided practical support and computer servers for many years. Press acted in the role of Development Director, became a Trustee in 2008 and subsequently Secretary to the Board. He took over as Chair in December 2015. Personal life Press was a member of the University of London Boat Club from 1968 to 1973. With UL he was several times British University Champion in various classes and won two Henley medals. He has remained active at Masters Level winning at Henley Veterans and World Rowing Masters. In 2011, he was part of an expedition that rowed 1000 km down the Zambezi from Angola to the Victoria Falls: Row Zambezi Expedition. Press is an experienced mountain and fell walker and his geological work provided the opportunity to travel in many wilderness areas of the world. Another passion is choral singing; as a student, Press was a peripatetic cathedral lay-clerk and has performed, broadcast and recorded with a number of London-based chamber choirs over the years. He currently sings with the Choir of the 21st Century, New Renaissance Voices and the Thomas Tallis Society. Press is married to landscape artist Julia Corfe and they divide their time between rural Kent, the Yorkshire Dales and the French Pyrenees. They have a daughter who is an art therapist.

It was built in 1910. It is also known as Burdekin Academy of Dance. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former St Patrick's Catholic Church, Brandon, is a timber church originally constructed in 1910 when Brandon was part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockhampton. It ceased to be used by the Church in 1974 and following severe cyclone damage in 1989 was moved to its present site by the Burdekin Shire Council. Despite the domination of plantation style sugar production, small selectors were also cultivating small plantings of cane throughout Queensland by the late 1860s. The advent of selectors seeking agricultural land was encouraged by the government with the introduction of the Alienation of Crown Lands Act of 1868. This act allowed people of limited means to acquire land for agricultural purposes. While land north of the Burdekin River was opened for closer settlement by 1868, the first land sales in the district did not take place until late 1878. William Bannister, who selected on the east side of Station Creek on 1 November 1878, subdivided part of his land soon after selection to form a township which he named Brandon. This township was a private town located close to the Pioneer Plantation. The population of the district grew rapidly after the land was opened for closer selection as did the demand for community services, social activity and spiritual support. The needs of Catholics in the district were met by visiting priests from Townsville who held services at Lewis Hoey's Pioneer Mill, Lynche's Hotel in Ayr, Sergt. McBride's police residence in Ayr, in the state school at Brandon, and at Burkes Hotel, Brandon. In 1893 the Burdekin District was attached to the Diocese of Rockhampton and in 1896 a meeting was held to decide where the first catholic church would be built in the Burdekin District. The decision was made to locate the church in Brandon and the building was opened in 1897 on a site close to where the first state school was constructed. This church was damaged in Cyclone Leonta in 1903 and was rebuilt from the damaged material. Around 1907 Ingham parish priests were given responsibility for the Burdekin district and in 1908 it passed to the care of Townsville Parish. Plans were made in 1910 for the establishment of a parish encompassing both Brandon and Ayr. This parish was established on St Patrick's Day, 17 March 1912, with Fr Jules Bucas as the first parish priest. Fr Bucas first resided in the sacristy of the new Brandon church. The old church was modified and moved to the convent site for use as a school. It was again moved in 1936 to become St Francis Catholic Church, Jarvisfield. The new parish remained part of the Diocese of Rockhampton until 1930 when the Diocese of Townsville was established. On 23 July 1944, a fire damaged a portion of St Patrick's sacristy which was repaired. The church continued in use by the Roman Catholic community until 1974 when a new church was opened on an adjoining site on 21 April by Bishop Leonard Faulkner, Bishop of the Diocese of Townsville. The old church was listed by the National Trust of Queensland and by the Australian Heritage Commission in 1975. It was sold by the Diocese in 1979 to Filippo Patane who leased it to the Burdekin Academy of Dance. In 1989 the building lost much of its roof cladding and was moved from its foundations during Cyclone Aivu. Fearing its collapse, the owner sold it for removal. The Burdekin Shire Council objected to the removal of the heritage-listed building and prevented its loss from the town by purchasing it in late April 1989. In January 1991 the building was relocated to a site beside the Renown Theatre on Spillar St, Brandon. as the nucleus of a \\"Heritage Estate\\" for the district. The Shire Council repaired the building for use as a community meeting place and weddings. In April 2015, the shire council repurposed the building as the Artspace where the Burdekin Artisans can display and sell local art and craftwork.  Description  The former St Patrick's Church, Brandon, is a single-storey timber building located on the outskirts of the town of Brandon. It addresses Spillar Street to the east, and sits on a triangular block formed by the North Coast railway line and the Bruce Highway. Adjacent is the former Renown Theatre and opposite a small park which includes the Brandon War Memorial. The former church is set on low stumps and is rectangular in form with a steeply pitched gable roof clad in corrugated iron. The front of the church is symmetrical with a central entry porch flanked by single lancet windows. The projecting gables have fretted brackets to the eaves. The external walls have exposed stud framing lined with chamferboards, with external sheeting flashing over the windows. The side walls of the former nave are supported by timber buttresses. The tall casement windows, doors and archways have pointed, arched heads. Other Gothic elements include ornament over the gable ties and infill to the wall buttresses. Entry is through the porch at the eastern end. The body of the building is an open hall with a polished timber floor. Above the entrance door is a loft reached by a narrow timber stair. The roof framing is supported on hammerbeam brackets with tie rods. The raked ceiling is lined with diagonal boarding. At the western end is a small room leading to the rear doors. No internal fittings survive.  Heritage listing  The former St Patrick's Catholic Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Patrick's Church demonstrates the early development of the Burdekin District and the growth of the Catholic Church in North Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is considered an excellent example of a \\"carpenter Gothic\\" church and was used as an exemplar of this style in the reference work Identifying Australian Architecture: Styles and Terms for 1788 to the Present by Apperley, Irving & Reynolds (1989). The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It is a well composed design and has considerable visual appeal, being listed on the Registers of both the National Estate and the National Trust of Queensland for its architectural merit. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It has strong associations with the Catholic community of the area and of the Shire of Burdekin in which it is thought to be the oldest building extant and whose Council purchased it to preserve it for this community.

These novels were published over a period of more than twenty years (1935–1958) and cover the period from 1911 until 1927.Stokes, p. 43. The series is based on Hanley's own experiences of growing up a Catholic of Irish descent in a city divided by sectarian tensions. The father, Denny (Dennis) Fury, had been a stoker on ships, as had Hanley's father. Both Hanley's parents were born in Ireland, his father Edward Hanley in Dublin, like Denny Fury, and his mother, Bridget Roache, in County Cork, like Fanny Fury.Chris Gostick, \\"Extra Material on James Hanley's Boy\\", in the OneWorld Classics edition of Boy (2007), pp.182-3.

St George's Hall, Liverpool to the left, Great North Western Hotel to the right. No date is given, but the action takes place over three or four weeks a few years before World War I. The strike that takes place in the novel, with its accompanying scenes of violence, appears to be based on the 1911 Liverpool general transport strike, also known as the '\\"great transport workers' strike\\", which involved dockers, railway workers and sailors, as well people from other trades. This paralysed Liverpool commerce for most of that summer.Stokes p. 43 The editors of the Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics edition of The Furys, and some critics, confuse the strike that occurs in the novel with the 1926 General Strike.See for example, Charles Ferrall and Dougal McNeill, Writing the 1926 General Strike. Cambridge University Press, pp. 152–7. The third novel in the series, Our Time is Gone, is set during World War I. At the centre of the novel is the figure of Fanny Fury and the conflicts within the Fury family that have been caused by her proud, domineering personality. Fanny no longer has anything to do with two of her children, Desmond and Maureen, both of whom in their restless ambition resemble her. Desmond because he married a Protestant and has abandoned his Catholic faith. Desmond is ruthlessly determined to get ahead and works as a union organiser. Fanny Fury objects to Maureen's marriage to the much older man, Joe Kilkey, who Maureen only married to get away from her mother. Her family also hate how she privileged the youngest child Peter by sending him to a Catholic seminary in Cork. Ireland, when he was eight, so that he could become a priest. This was his mother Fanny Furys' dream and Peter's schooling represents a significant sacrifice for the Fury family, who live in the slums of Gelton (Liverpool). Like James Joyce's Stephen Daedalus, in Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and Joe Rourke in Hanley's first novel Drift, Peter Fury rebel against his strict Roman Catholic upbringing, and a major event of the novel is Peter's return from Ireland in disgrace, after having been expelled for visiting a brothel. Peter is accompanied by Fanny's sister Brigid Managuan, who has remained at home in Cork, Ireland and never married. Peter is now sixteen and, soon after he returns, has an affair with his brother Desmond's wife, who is rumoured to be a prostitute. The 1911 strike provides a violent backdrop to the family conflict, and the working class is not presented as \\"the hope for the future\\" in this novel, but as \\"an undisciplined and purposeless mass\\".Stokes, p. 48. The oldest son Desmond is directly involved with the strike because he is a union organizer, and during the riot he is involved in a violent altercation with a mounted policeman. During the strike Peter has a strange encounter with the Mephistophelian, homosexual Professor Titmouse, who sensing Peter's \\"fascination with the sights and sounds of the riots [...] lures him into the central square\\".Fordham, 132-3. Titmouse represents a cynical view of the motives that lead to the riot, yet Stokes suggests that \\"through his lunatic rhetoric is somewhat equivocally conveyed what one assumes to be Hanley's own view\\".Stokes, p. 47. Peter, together with his sister-in-law Sheila, is later again drawn to a scene of violence, and she's is showered with blood when a young man standing next to her is shot. The fact that Denny Fury goes on strike, combined with unpaid fees for Peter's schooling creates a financial crisis for Fanny Fury, and causes her to first sell furniture and steal her husband's savings, and then leads her to having to borrow money at an exorbitant rate of interest from the money lender Mrs Ragner, with whom her daughter Maureen already has an account. Joe Kilkey, who is a good Catholic agrees to stand surety for the loan, despite his wife's objection. It appears that Fanny's father, Anthony Mangan, had earlier helped finance Peter's schooling. Anthony Mangan has suffered a stroke and his silent, paralysed body, bound to a chair, dominates the Fury household. Stone lions guarding, The Plateau, St George's Hall, Liverpool, Peter Fury and Professor Titmouse watch the riot from the back of one of these lions The conclusion of the novel has Peter leaving to become a sailor. But just before he joins his ship, two photos of Sheila fall from his pocket, confirming his mother's suspicion, and Fanny Fury violently attacks her son both verbally and physically. The novel received \\"a mixed reception from reviewers in both\\" Britain and the United States and \\"some thought it one of the most important novels in several years\\". It was partiuclarly criticized for being \\"shapeless\\". In partial defence Edward Stokes, in The Novels of James Hanley, argues that The Fury, is \\"a prologue or overture\\" to a trilogy.Stokes. 46.

Accessed 17 february 2018  1911 Liverpool general transport strike The strike of 1911 transformed trade unionism on Merseyside. For the first time, general trade unions were able to establish themselves on a permanent footing and become genuine mass organisations of the working class. Strike action began on 14 June when the National Sailors' and Firemen's Union announced a nationwide merchant seamen's strike. Solidarity action in support of the seamen led to other sections of workers coming out on strike. A strike committee – chaired by syndicalist Tom Mann – was formed to represent all the workers in dispute. Many meetings were held on St. George's Plateau, next to St. George's Hall on Lime Street, including the rally on 13 August where police baton charged a crowd of 85,000 people, who had gathered to hear Tom Mann speak. This became known as \\"Bloody Sunday\\". In the police charges and subsequent unrest that carried on through the following night, over 350 people were injured. 3,500 British troops were stationed in the city by this time. Two days later, soldiers of the 18th Hussars opened fire on a crowd on Vauxhall Road, injuring fifteen, two fatally: John Sutcliffe, a 19-year-old Catholic carter, was shot twice in the head, and Michael Prendergast, a 30-year-old Catholic docker, was shot twice in the chest. An inquest into their deaths later brought in a verdict of 'justifiable homicide'.Near to Revolution: The Liverpool general transport Strike North West TUC, 2011 Home Secretary Winston Churchill sent in troops and positioned the cruiser HMS Antrim in the Mersey. =Volume 2: The Secret Journey (1936)= Takes place a year later, over about a month in 1912.Stokes, p.43. when Peter Fury has just returned from his first voyage. There are several plot-lines, including Peter Fury's affair with Sheila, his brother Desmond's wife, the break-up Maureen's marriage to Joe Kilkey, and the return of Anthony Mangan to Ireland. However, the main story involves Fanny Fury's growing indebtedness to the moneylender Anna Ragner, because she is unable to meet her monthly payments and has to take out additional loans. Critic Edward Stokes argues that this novel \\"has more shape than The Furys,\\" because it focusses on this story.Stokes, p. 55. He also describes A Secret Journey as a \\"strange and lurid a world in which characters loom out of the mist, portentous and larger-than-life\\".Stokes p. 60. Peter Fury has been persuaded to take a shore job on the railway by his mother, but this leads to tension between him and his father – because Denny Fury is aware of the adulterous affair, as indeed is Fanny – and Denny Fury goes back to sea. When another son Anthony arrives home, Fanny tries to persuade him to take a shore job, so that there will still be some semblance of family life. She is struggling against a growing sense of loneliness. Because Fanny sends Peter to Mrs Ragner as her go-between, he learns of the debt, and realises how much his education in Ireland contributed to this situation. Furthermore, Mrs Ragner falls in love with Peter and pays him for sexual favours. Peter is flattered by having two women interested in him, though Mrs Ragner also disgusts him, but because of her interest in Peter Mrs Ragner does not foreclose on his mother, to the disgust of her factotum Daniel Corkran. Another important plot- line involves the relation of Maureen's relationship with the much-older Joe Kilkey, who she only married so as to get away from her mother. Joe stood surety for Fanny's loan and will not go back on his promise, though Maureen tells him that he should. This leads Maureen to try and raise money. When her brother Desmond refuses, it appears that she went to her former foreman at the jute factory, where she had worked, and somehow obtained the money. This leads to a break-up of what was already a shaky marriage, and Maureen abandons her husband and baby son. Fanny Fury is changing and struggling to cope, and when her sister Brigid Managan comes from Ireland with plans to take their paralysed father, Anthony Mangan, back to Cork she surprisingly agrees. Brigid believes that he has money. Soon after she gets back to Cork she takes him to Lourdes, France, seeking a miracle cure, so that he will regain his speech and reveal where his money is. Anna Ragner learns from Corkran about Peter and Sheila and realises that Peter hates her like everyone else does. She now demands full payment from Fanny Fury, who she hates because Mrs Fury does not cringe before her like everyone else does. After his mother Peter is the one most disturbed by events, and he leaves work at lunchtime because he cannot concentrate. His relationship with Sheila has deteriorated, and just after leaving work he sees her going into a hotel, where she meets a business man. He then realises that she is a prostitute. This further increase Peter's emotional turmoil, and eventually, late at night, he manages to get into Anna Ragner's house, where her, in a crazed state, he murders. The novel ends with Peter, covered in blood, being pursued by a mob across Gelton and then arriving him deliriously proclaiming that they are now \\"free\\". John Fordham notes a parallel between Peter Fury's murder of Anna Ragner and Raskolnikov's murder of the money lender in Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment.Fordham, pp. 134-5. He also sees in the murder \\"an evident desire for social as well as familial vengeance, since Mrs Ragner's power is directly linked to the economic oppression of Gelton's working class\\".Fordham, p. 135. =Volume 3. Our Time is Gone (1940)= Takes place during the middle of the First World War, \\"Parts I and II [...] in November and December 1915, Part III in August and September 1916\\",Stokes, p. 43. and was originally intended to be the final part of a trilogy. The father Denny Fury has returned to the sea, \\"as a stoker on a liner that has been taken over as a troopship,\\"Stokes, p. 61. and Desmond Fury is a captain in the army, and has moved with his wife Sheila to London. Peter Fury is serving a fifteen-year prison sentence for his murder of Mrs Ragner. At the beginning of the novel Fanny Fury has suffered a nervous breakdown because of the murder, but after spending time in hospital she recovers. Fanny moves into a riverside slum to hide from those who know her and works as a cleaner on troop and hospital ships. She also visits Peter in prison.Stokes, pp. 61-2. As the novel's title suggests, the main theme \\"is the disintegration and dispersal of the Fury family\\".Stokes, p. 65. Our Time is Gone is noteworthy for the variety of settings it has, compared with the previous two Furys' novels, with more than a third set outside of Gelton: \\"in Slye's seedy lodgings in Blacks, in Desmond's London flat, 'in camp', in prison, on a ship at sea, [in Ireland], and on trains\\" Stokes, p.63. While John Fordham describes the novel as \\"formidable\\",Fordham, p. 151. Edward Stokes criticises the lack of connection between the various parts of the novel: that the three major characters, Mrs Fury, Desmond Fury, and Joe Kilkey exist \\"in his or her own world, which touches the others rarely or not at all.Stokes, p. 64. In this novel more information is given about Sheila (Downey) Furys' mysterious past, \\"the decadent\\" family, her invalid, weepy mother, and \\"dissolute father\\", and the family's Irish estate which is \\"virtually derelict\\", that Desmond Fury visits.Stokes, p. 66, Fordham, p. 153. Published in 1940, at the beginning of World War II, Our Time is Gone is concerned very much with \\"the devastating effect of the First World War upon the entire social range\\".Fordham, p. 152. John Fordham comments on the fact that Our Time is Gone \\"discloses a surprisingly non-belligerent tone for a Second World War novel\\" and the \\"unprecedented\\", for a novel published during a war, \\"central heroism of Joseph Kilkey\\" who is a conscientious objector.John Fordham, James Hanley: Modernism and the Working Class, p. 150. In addition to describing Joe Kilkey \\"languishing in prison\\", there are descriptions of Denny Fury struggling to save a young boy after his ship is torpedoed, and of Fanny Fury with an \\"army of scrubbing women, who endeavour to restore filthy, stinking troopships to some semblance of cleanliness and order\\".Stokes p. 67. Hanley had himself both served in the merchant marine during World War I, and, later, had briefly fought in France with the Canadian Army.Chris Gostick, \\"Extra Material on James Hanley's Boy\\", in the OneWorld Classics edition of Boy (2007), pp.181-4. At the end of the novel it is presumed that Denny Fury drowned at sea. Hanley had previously written about World War I in his novella The German Prisoner (1930), and novel The Hollow Sea (1938). =Volume 4. Winter Song (1950)= The action takes place over about a month, \\"apparently March\\", though it is not \\"certain whether the war is still on\\".Stokes, p. 69. \\" Winter Song is, as its title implies, a novel of old age\\".Fordham, p. 194. In the first part of the novel Denny Fury returns home, afte having being presumed dead following the torpedoing of his ship. Fanny Fury believing herself widowed has retired to a Catholic hospice for the dying. Stokes comments that though it \\"runs to over 300 pages [...] its plot can be summarized in a few lines\\".Stokes, p. 68. Denny Fury arrives back in Gelton with two, young drunken sailors, \\"who have dragged him have across the world\\", after being torpedoed, it turns out, twice, physically and mentally shattered, and without a home.Stokes, p. 68. Following the reunion of Denny and Fanny Fury they spend a few weeks with their son-in-law, Joe Kilkey, before returning to Ireland. However, prior to taking the Irish ferry, they both set out on a long train journey to visit Peter in prison in a place called Darnton. On the train they encounter a man who is going to the prison to help the hangman the next day. When they arrive at the station, however, Denny Fury suffers a physical collapse, and \\"[a]nother dream of Mrs Fury's is shattered\\" and they return to Gelton without seeing Peter.Stokes, p. After retiring to the hospice Fanny had \\"lost all her imperiousness and resolution\\", but she quickly regains them in organising the trip to the prison and then to Ireland, despite Denny's misgivings, especially with living with Fanny's sister Brigid in Cork, with whom he has never got on. The novel concludes with Fanny and Denny Fury arriving in Dublin, Ireland, where their seaman, son Anthony lives, on their way to Cork. John Fordham describes this final journey as a \\"journey to a country [Ireland] where the possibility of redemption from the postlapsian world of [Industrial England] still exists\\".Fordham, p. 194. Readers learn in the final Furys' novel, An End and a Beginning that Fanny Fury died after returning to Cork, when she her heart gave out when gunmen opened fire close by. After this happened Denny Fury never spoke again.An End and a Beginning (1958), p. 89. With regard to when the novel takes place there is, according to Stokes, \\"hopeless confusion.Stokes, p. 69. However, men are still returning from torpedoed ships at the beginning of the novel,Winter Song (1950), p. 23. and the gunmen, who cause Fanny Fury's heart attack – mentioned in An End and a Beginning – were probably engaged in the Irish War of Independence, which began January 1919 and ended with a truce in July 1921 (violence continued in Northern Ireland, and there was the subsequent Irish Civil War, June 1922 to May 1923). Fordham refers to an \\"act of Republican terrorism\\".Fordham, p. 197. =Volume 5. An End and a Beginning (1958)= Liverpool Prison in Walton, Liverpool, 1910. The prison in Winter Song, is in another town, but that in An End and a Beginning, which Peter leaves c.1927, is in Gelton (Liverpool). The concluding novel takes place over roughly three weeks, presumably in 1927 or 1928, because \\"Peter Fury has just been released from prison after serving fifteen years for the murder he committed in 1912\\".Stokes, pp. 43, 76. This prison is in Gelton, whereas in Winter Song Peter's parents travel by train for several hours to a prison in the town of Darnton planning to visit him. Soon after leaving the prison, Peter travels to Cork, Ireland, where he visits the graves of his parents and his aunt Brigid Mangan, who is now senile and does not know him. He also learns that his mother died of a heart attack brought on by Irish Republican gunfire.An End and a Beginning, p. 89. At the suggestion of his sister-in-law, and former lover, Sheila, Peter then goes to Rams Gate, Rath Na, the ancestral home of the Downeys – Sheila's family – where shortly afterwards she joined him. The house, run by the housekeeper Miss Fetch, has survived the both the Irish war of independence of 1919–1921, and the Irish Civil War of 1922–1923, when many Anglo-Irish residences were burnt.Fordham, p. 198. Most of the action takes place in Ireland and it is Hanley's second novel set there, the first being Resurrexit Dominus (1934), that was published in a limited edition of 110 copies.Linnea Gibbs, James Hanley: A Bibliography. Vancouver, Canada: William Hoffer, 1980, p. 39. There are also in The Secret Journey a couple of scenes in Cork, involving Brigid Mangan, and in Our Time is Gone Desmond Fury visits his wife's home Rams Gate, Rath Na. Peter believes that Sheila comes home because of him, but in reality she has left her husband Desmond, and believes that she can find happiness again by bringing her father back to the family home and bringing the house back to life again. During An End and a Beginning Peter Fury \\"relives many of the key elements of the [...] life of his family, through [...] flashbacks and interior monologues\\".Chris Gostick, \\"Extra Material\\", in Boy, by James Hanley, London: OneWorld Classics, 2007, p. 201. However, the details of past events recorded here differ considerably from those given in earlier Furys novels, so much so the Edward Stokes suggests that the \\"novel is so different from its predecessors [...] that it is probably better to regard it as a completely independent novel\\".Stokes, p. 76. In the revised version of events told in An End and a Beginning, Peter came home several times from Clongowes College \\"whereas in The Furys he did not return home at all for seven years\\".Stokes, p. 77. Again, as told here, he was not expelled for immorality, but runs away because he has become aware of the cost of his education to his family.Stokes, p. 77. Another major difference, is that, in the revised version of events told in this novel, Peter did not have an affair with Mrs Ragner, and she does not know him when he comes into her bedroom prior to killing her.Stokes, p. 77. There are other various other differences, including Fanny and Denny Fury arriving in Cork by ferry, whereas in Winter Song they arrive in Dublin, in order to visit their son Anthony's family, before travelling on to Cork. There is also a different version of Sheila (Downey) Fury's past life. Whereas in The Furys her past is a mystery, about which her husband Desmond never questions her (neither does her lover Peter Fury), in An End and a Beginning, the reader learns that when she first met Desmond, she gave him a full account of past and family.Stokes, p. 76. Again here there is no mention of her being a prostitute, or that Peter in The Secret Journey had seen her with a businessman at a hotel. Sheila restarts her affair with Peter, but this is only out of pity for him and the reader soon learns that she is still in love with Desmond, despite his unwillingness to start a family, and neglect of her in pursuit of ambition.Stokes, pp. 80, 84. She, therefore, gives up \\"her impossible dream\\" of regaining the happiness she remembers from her childhood in Ireland, returns to her husband in Gelton.Stokes, p. 80. The housekeeper Miss fetch is a third major character in this novel, according to Stokes \\"a remarkable creation\\".Stokes, p. 84. Born into an impoverished fisherman's family at sixteen she became a servant at the Downey's house, where Downey seduces her, and she falls in love with him. This was some forty years earlier. Subsequently, years later, she had a brief affair with the postman Cullen, who may have hoped to marry her.An End and a Beginning, p. 314. However, at the time of the novel, Miss Fetch is leading a contented life as a devout Catholic, sewing for the Church, and carefully maintaining the house, and her memories of the more lively past. The arrival of first the goal-bird Peter, and then Sheila, upset Miss Fetch's life of calm routine, and she is then given notice by Sheila. But, at the end of the novel, even though Sheila's brother sells the house to an order of Carmelite nuns, Miss Fetch retains her room in the house and on the novel's final page she kneels down by her bed \\"and thanked God for her great content\\".And End, p. 315 While at Rams Gate an important event is Peter's encounter with Franciscan friars, and his telling the story of his life to one of the monks. Peter had thought earlier going to America,An End and a Beginning, p. 7. where there are relatives, and later thinks of returning to Gelton, but the novel ends with Peter contemplating joining a German merchant ship, where no one will know of his past, and sailing to South American. While Peter has by the end of the novel \\"managed to stagger a few paces along the road to freedom and independence\\" it is unclear what the future holds for him.Stokes, p. 84. Themes Edward Stokes suggests that \\"if the theme of the novel can be stated in one word, that word is \\"Imprisonment\\". Firstly Peter \\"remains imprisoned in the past–in the memory of his mother's destructive\\" plan for him to become a priest, and his memory of the happiness that he found in his affair with his sister-in-law Sheila. Sheila is herself \\"imprisoned in her love for Desmond [Fury]\\", while Miss Fetch \\"wants nothing except to be allowed to remain in the prison that she knows and loves\\", the deserted mansion of Rams Gate.Stokes, pp. 83-4. Characters *Mrs Fanny Fury – is the central character in all but An End and a Beginning, the final novel of the sequence. Fanny is a devout Catholic from a fishing village in Cork, Ireland. Her pride and manipulation of her children's lives causes much unhappiness. She also constantly complains about her husband's lack of ambition and has nothing to do with her children Desmond or Maureen. Fanny Fury gets herself into debt, and, at the end of The Secret Journey, is faced with having her furniture seized by Mrs Ragner. In Winter Song Fanny and Dennis Fury return to Cork, where they both die. *Denis Fury – is a sailor, born in Dublin, who in The Furys is working ashore. In The Secret Journey he goes to sea again, because the tension at home, following Peter's return. *Desmond Fury – the oldest son, who has abandoned his Catholic faith, and is determined to better himself, though his union activities. He becomes a Gelton town councillor and during World War I, in Our Time is Gone, he is a Captain in the army. *Sheila Downey – Desmond Fury's wife, whom he met while holidaying in Ireland. Little is initially learnt about her, but she comes from an Anglo-Irish family and there is a family home, Ra Nath, in Cork, where Peter Fury stays in An End and a Beginning. It appears that she is a prostitute and, at the end of The Secret Journey, Peter, with whom she has been having an affair, follows her to a hotel where she meets with a business man. In An End and a Beginning she and Peter Fury attempt to continue their earlier affair, but this is a failure and she returns to Desmond. *Maureen Fury – she is ambitious, like her mother and brother Desmond, and leaves her husband Joe Kilkey and baby, in The Secret Journey. *Joe Kilkey – is the husband of Maureen Fury, a good Catholic and a stevedore. He is very ugly and old enough to be her father, and Maureen only married him to escape her mother. *John Fury – is a son who was killed in an accident. *Anthony Fury – is another son who arrives home in The Secret Journey, after injuring himself by falling from a ship's mast onto his feet. His mother wants him to stay ashore, along with Peter, so that she can retain some semblance of family life. *Peter Fury – is the youngest son, who went to Clongowes College, in Ireland, when he was eight years old. in order to become a priest. He is expelled because he visited a brothel and returns home in disgrace, at the beginning of The Furys, aged sixteen. On his return Peter has an affair with his sister-in-law, Sheila and later with Mrs Ragner. At the end of The Secret Journey he murders Anna Ragner. Our Time is Gone we learn that he is serving a fifteen years sentence for the murder, and An End and a Beginning is about his life after he leaves prison. *Brigid Mangan – is Fanny Fury's unmarried sister, who is also a devout Catholic that works ceaselessly for the Church. She lives in Cork, Ireland, but visits Gelton in both The Furys and The Secret Journey. She is senile and does not recognize Peter when he visits her in An End and a Beginning. *Anthony Mangan – Brigid and Fanny Fury's father, who lives with Fanny. He has suffered a stroke and is unable to talk. In A Secret Journey, Brigid takes his home to Ireland, because she believes that he has money. Soon after returning to Cork she then takes her father to Lourdes, France, in the hope that he will miraculously regain his speech there, and so be able to reveal where his money can be found. *Professor R.

Born the son of a forest ranger in Mojokerto, he became interested in music at a young age and became a member of a Surabaya-based orchestra. By the 1930s he was composing his own kroncong songs and playing the violin and singing on radio broadcasts, gaining enough popularity to be contracted to Majestic Films in 1941 and score two films. During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, he composed the song \\"Bagimu Negeri\\", later considered his most significant work. During the Indonesian National Revolution, Koesbini supported the republican government, and after the revolution concluded he operated his own music school while working for the Ministry of Teaching, Education, and Culture and continuing to write new songs. From a young age Koesbini wrote a mixture of nationalist and popular songs, generally in the kroncong style. In his collaborations he would allow others, such as the authors Armijn Pane and Achdiat K. Mihardja, to serve as lyricists. He wrote original songs for two films, Djantoeng Hati and Air Mata Iboe (both 1941), as well as several stage plays. Early life Koesbini was born in Kemlagi, a village in Mojokerto, eastern Java, Dutch East Indies, on 1 January 1910, a Legi Friday. He was the third son born to Koesnio, a forest ranger, and Moesinah. He considered his childhood as the son of a ranger, constantly moving about, to have helped him develop nationalistic leanings. Koesbini began his formal schooling at a in Jombang. He went on to study at a MULO in Surabaya; he continued his education at the S. de Senerpont Domis trade school. Musical career=Colonial period= As a child, Koesbini enjoyed music, learning on his own. In Surabaya he joined the Jong Indisch Stryk-en Tokkel Orchestra under his brother, Koesbandi. In 1927 he left to attend a music course at the Apollo Music School in Malang, staying there until 1930. Between 1935 and 1939 he was a violin player and singer for the NIROM and CIRVO broadcasts in Surabaya, and was soon contracted by the Hoo Soen Hoo gramophone company to produce records. Koesbini soon began writing, arranging, and orchestrating kroncong songs; these included songs with nationalist themes such as \\"Kewadjiban Manoesia\\", \\"Tjinta Tanah Air\\", and \\"Merdeka\\", as well as more popular tunes such as \\"Krontjong Poerbakala\\", \\"Bintang Sendjakala\\", and \\"Kerontjong Sarinande\\". He also wrote tunes to lyrics by other authors, such as \\"Padi Mengoening\\" (lyrics by Armijn Pane), \\"Rontje Melati\\" (lyrics by Achdiat K. Mihardja), and \\"Lagu Kasihku\\" (lyrics by Kirdjomuljo). In his Ensiklopedi Musik Indonesia, Remy Sylado noted that Koesbini would often perform kroncong adaptations of popular Western songs such as Ballard MacDonald and Harry Carroll's \\"The Trail of the Lonesome Pine\\" and Enrico Toselli's \\"Serenata\\", giving them Malay-language names. In 1941 Koesbini was contracted by Fred Young's Majestic Film Company as a music director; his troupe, the Krontjong Syncopaters, joined as well. For the company's first production, Djantoeng Hati, he wrote seven kroncong songs to be sung by the main cast; for the title song, \\"Djantoeng Hati\\", he led a 60-strong orchestra. Majestic's second and final film, Air Mata Iboe, featured eleven kroncong songs, many by Koesbini; the music director also took on the role of Bakar, a man too poor to support his mother-in-law (Fifi Young) after she is driven from her home. Though the company was based in Malang, much of its shooting was conducted in the colonial capital of Batavia; Koesbini soon moved there. Koesbini in 1943 After the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies began in 1942, Koesbini worked for the Japanese-run Cultural Centre. He soon migrated to the People's Labour Center (Poetera) in Cikini, Batavia. In 1942 he composed the song \\"Bagimu Negeri\\", singing to the nationalist leader Sukarno an early version of the song, which used the term Indonesia raya ('Greater Indonesia') in the final line. Though Sukarno approved of the song's nationalist sentiments, he demanded that the final line be changed; Indonesia raya was thus replaced by jiwa raga kami ('our bodies and souls'). According to Hari Budiono, this change allowed Koesbini to escape censorship during the occupation, as the song had no explicit mention of Indonesia; indeed, \\"Bagimu Negeri\\" was first broadcast on a Japanese-run radio station, sung by Ibu Sud. =Independent Indonesia= Towards the end of the occupation, Koesbini provided music for several pro-nationalist stage plays, including Lukisan Zaman (Portrait of the Times, by Armijn Pane). During the Indonesian National Revolution (1945-1949), he was a member of the Committee for the National Anthem \\"Indonesia Raya\\" in Yogyakarta. When his work with this committee concluded in 1949, he decided to stay in the city. Koesbini was taken on as an employee of the Ministry of Teaching, Education, and Culture, heading the music office of the Yogyakarta branch of the ministry. He continued to write songs with a number of musicians, including Himodigdojo, D. Suradji, and Sri Murtono; many, such as his \\"Hymne The New Emerging Forces\\" (\\"Hymn of the New Emerging Forces\\") and \\"Nasakom Bersatu\\" (\\"Nasakom Unite\\", lyrics by Subronto), contained nationalist themes. He also compiled song lyrics and information on the history of Indonesian music and operated a music school, the Sanggar Olah Seni Indonesia, which he established in 1951. Later life By 1965, \\"Bagimu Negeri\\" was considered compulsory for Indonesian elementary school students; it is still considered Koesbini's most enduring song. Koesbini was awarded the Arts and Culture Award from the Indonesian government in 1972, followed by an award for by the commander of National Defense Area II (Pangkowilhan II) in 1976. On 27 May 1987 the state television network TVRI broadcast a biographical documentary on him as part of a series on Indonesian cultural figures. By 1990, Koesbini and his wife Ngadiyan had had eleven children. After Koesbini's death on 28 February 1991, he was buried in a simple ceremony to the sound of \\"Perdamaian\\", one of his compositions. The road in front of his home was renamed Koesbini Street by the Yogyakarta Municipal Government. , the Sanggar Olah Seni Indonesia is still maintained by Koesbini's children.

In 1287, he was appointed governor of Al Karak, a post which he held until Qalawun's death in 1290. He was amir al-hajj in 701 AH (1302). His Zubda is a universal chronicle which ends just prior to his death.

It aired on MBC on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 22:00. Synopsis A romantic comedy about a once-popular first generation girl-group, whose members are in their 30s and are living very different lives, and the men they encounter as they fall in love once again. In the 1990s, Han Mi-mo (Jang Na-ra), Baek Da-jung (Yoo Da- in), Go Dong-mi (Yoo In-na), Hong Ae-ran (Seo In-Young) and Goo Seul-ah (Sandara Park) were once members of the successful idol group \\"Angels\\". However, the group struggled internally due to Seul-ah's intolerable attitude and meanness, which was further aggravated by her being the most popular member. Fed up with Seul-ah's selfishness, Mi-mo got into a highly publicized physical fight with her and the group disbanded in 2003. Retired from show business, the once-divorced Mi-mo now works as a rep for a remarriage consulting business and is expecting to marry her fiancée Jeonghoon. Tragically, Seul-ah rears her head again and Mi-mo is dumped in favor of the popular singer-turned-actress. Her former bandmate Da-jung is also a rep at the same company. She married a rich man, but her marriage is on the rocks. Dong-mi, who was the least popular member in the group, is now an elementary school teacher. Over the years, she has lost her good looks and feels lonely. Ae-ran is a representative for an internet shopping mall. The women are all still friends with the exception of Seul-ah. Song Soo-hyuk (Jung Kyung-ho) is a reporter and a single father. He has a friend, Goo Hae-joon (Kwon Yul), who is a doctor and single. Song Soo-hyuk and Goo Hae-joon become involved with the women.

Built in 1925-26, this Art Deco building was built to meet the ideals of the time for what a high school should be. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Description and history The Old Brewer High School is located in the city's most densely built residential area, on a lot bounded by Somerset and Center Streets to the north and east, and separated from Parker Street by a line of residences. It is roughly rectangular in shape, two stories in height, with the ground floor slightly below grade on the front (north-facing) facade. It has a somewhat industrial Art Deco appearance, with outer wing sections whose facades are plain brick except for secondary double-door entrances at the base, and a decorative cast stone panel roughly at mid-height. Between these wings are nine bays, arranged with five central bays set in recessed round-arch panels, projecting bays flanking those, and recessed bays at the outside, which have the main entrances on the ground floor. Windows are paired sash, with those on the second floor topped by fixed transom windows.Corbett, Matthew (2014). NRHP nomination for Brewer High School; available by request from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission Prior to the construction of Brewer's first high school in 1873, the city's secondary education was provided by neighboring Bangor's high school. Brewer experience significant growth over the following decades, making evident the need for enlarged and updated facilities. The city commissioned Butterfield & Guertin of Manchester, New Hampshire to design a new high school, which was completed in 1926. This facility was built to meet recently published detailed guidelines for school buildings, these specifications covering everything from site selection to building materials and interior layout. The school was located near to many students, on a large lot that would accommodate expansion and athletic facilities, and was built with fire-resistant materials in a layout that provided large amounts of natural light. It had dedicated separate spaces for use as auditorium and gymnasium, and had space for industrial and domestic vocational education. In 1947 a new combined gymnasium/shop space was built in a separate structure behind the present school. This was replaced in 1979 with a modern brick building, which was connected to the main building by a single- story hyphen.

The Regiment was based at Zeerust. It was previously known both as in English 2 Special Service Battalion, and in the Afrikaans Language as 2 Spesiale Diens Bataljon (2 SSB and 2 SDB). History 2 Special Service Battalion was founded on 1 May 1946 at Potchefstroom. The S.S.B. was a military unit formed to take in unfortunate young men who were unable to find employment at the time. Before World War II the Special Service Battalion was re-organized into 2 battalions – 1st and 2nd Special Service Battalion. In 1946 after World War II the South African Armoured Corps, was thus officially proclaimed and the Special Service Battalion was included in the corps as the only full-time unit, its symbols and colours were incorporated. =Infantry= Initially, the sole purpose of 2 SSB was to train members of the Permanent Force as Infantrymen. 2 SSB was put into service officially on 21 February 1947 and on 26 January 1951 the name changed from 2 SSB to 1 South African Infantry Battalion (1 SAI). 2 SSB can thus be seen as the founding unit of the South African Infantry Corps. =Armour changeover= C-Squadron of 2 Armoured Car Regiment was founded during February 1962 with its official base at Zeerust. On 22 December 1966 the name was adapted to C-Squadron 1 SSB. On 1 October 1973 2 SSB, born from C-Squadron 1 SSB was resettled. The headquarters of the Regiment as well as C-Squadron 1 SSB was stationed at Zeerust, while D-Squadron 1 SSB was detached to 2 South African Infantry Battalion at Walvis Bay. =Border War= Several squadrons have taken part in the war in Namibia and Angola since 1974. From 8 October 1975 to 31 January 1976, B-, C- and D-Squadron took part in Operation Savannah. This border duty was continued with significant participations in Operation Protea, Daisy, Hooper and Modular. On 25 January 1988, 2 SSB became the first unit in South Africa to receive the Right Of Free Admission to a coloured community, namely Henryville.http://samilitaryhistory.org/18/p18febne.html 2 SSB squadron training exercise =Bophuthatswana coup d'état= On 10 February 1988, 2 SSB took part in Operation Adding during which President Lucas Mangope and his government was returned to power, after a failed coup d’état. =Rooikat Conversion= In May 1990, 2 SSB received the first Rooikat armoured cars and on 30 June its National Colours. =Corps Change ARMOUR to INFANTRY= On 31 December 1992, as part of the reduction of the SA Army after withdrawal from SWA- Namibia (Resolution 435), 2 SSB underwent a change in role. The unit was transformed from an Armoured Car Regiment to a Motorised Infantry Battalion and provided with an operational company (A-Company) which was transferred from Group 20. During the historical General Elections of 1994, 2 SSB took part in Operation Baccarat (stability in Mmabatho and Passado (border protection) as a peace force to ensure stability in the North West Province). On 19 December 1994, the Bophuthatswana Defence Force Parachute Battalion at Gopane was placed under operational command of 2 SSB, as part of the founding of the SANDF. 2 SSB withdrew simultaneously from Nietverdiend and Nooitgedacht.

It was Meghana's sincerity and honesty and Aditya's unbelievable understating and love for his wife that they made this journey together. Their initial awkwardness and aloofness turned into beautiful friendship and Meghana's realization of true love for Aditya started a lifelong relationship.  Plot  It is a story of Aditya Desai and Meghana Kudalkar. Aditya Desai, a handsome young man who is matured, understanding & everything else a woman can dream of is a Chartered Accountant. Aditya has been brought up in a cultured, close-knit family & lives by the values that he has been brought up with. Meghana and Aditya Nagarkar love each other but this relationship is not accepted by her dominating father Suresh Kudalkar. He wants some settled man for his daughter and doesn't allow Meghana to have any contact with Aditya Nagarkar. Meghana's mother's sister finds Aditya Desai suitable groom for Meghana and arranges a meeting. Aditya Desai falls in love with Meghana at first sight when he, along with his family comes for said meeting. Meghana's marriage gets fixed with Aditya Desai. Meghana tries everything to contact her boyfriend Aditya Nagarkar but all in vain and eventually fate brings Meghana alongside Aditya Desai by tying their knot & they together set out on the journey of life as husband & wife. On the first wedding night, Meghana tells everything about her boyfriend and love affair to Aditya Desai. He takes the decision to allow her freedom to choose between him and her boyfriend. As time passes, Meghana finds herself becoming a part of the Desai family and unknowingly falls in love with Aditya. She confesses her love for him and everyone in the family notices the change in their dynamic. Later they consummate their marriage. One day, Archana accidentally opens a box in Aditya Meghana's bedroom consisting photos of Aditya Nagarkar and Meghana together. She tells about this to Desai family. Everyone gets shock of their life. They get angry with Meghana and Aditya for not telling this to them. Gradually and patiently, Meghana proves her love for Aditya Desai and the devotion to the family. One day Aditya Desai accidentally finds Aditya Nagarkar in a critical condition. Having been friends, he cannot find in himself to leave him in such a critical state. He admits him in a hospital and tells this to Meghana and the family. Later Desai family also proudly supports this gentle and compassionate gesture of Aditya. Suresh Kudalkar couldn't digest it and bashes Meghana for this. With her family's support, Meghana brings the episode to a conclusion while expressing her disappointment over her parents' behavior. Upset with Meghana's lack of response to his apologies, Sureshrao impulsively walks away from home to seek solace in some godman's advice leaving Madhavi - his wife - worried sick. When the Desai family hears this, they silently condemn this gesture but Archana vehemently opposes this behavior. She challenges this behavior and these questions make Madhavi reconsider her marriage with Suresh. However, it upsets Meghana that her parents may get separated. However, Maai asks her to look at the whole matter as a woman and not as a daughter. After an upsetting and selfish call from her father makes her see light, she decides to support her mother. When Sureshrao comes to know this, he doesn't take it seriously, he starts to realize the seriousness of the situation and the error of his ways. He decides to make amends and change his attitude. With time, Madhavi sees the change in him and decides to return home and start anew. This changed dynamic also happens to boost Madhavi's morale and makes Suresh realize that his wife is actually quite smart and intelligent. Around the same time, Chitra, Archana's sister- in-law, enters the family. she immediately gels with Meghana and Aditya. She confides in them her love for a guy named Manoj Vengurlekar who is smart amd intelligent but also arrogant and short-tempered. Her love story with creates some clash between Aditya and Meghana due to different points of view. Eventually, she marries Manoj but still faces challenges in her marriage because of her idealizing Aditya and Meghana and constantly comparing her marriage with theirs. Not to mention Manoj's radical and short-tempered nature. However, after a short stay with the Desai family, they both realize their mistakes and see how joyful love can be. They decide to give their marriage another chance and return to their home town. Around the same time, Suresh proposes the redevelopment of Desaiwadi. While Amit exuberantly supports this notion, Aditya doesn't find in himself supporting it. Especially when he sees how upset Maai is with this. Nana seems to be resigned to the situation. Aditya finally decides to confront Nana and explain to him how he has completely ignored Maai's pleas to not agree for the redevelopment. After understanding his mistake, Nana apologizes to Maai. Later Aditya also explains to Amit about the mistake that they would be making if they proceeded with the redevelopment. Amit agrees. This however puts a wrench in Amit's business plans. Meghana completes her M.A Final Year and takes a job as a lecturer. She befriends Anjali at the Training Center in Nagpur. Anjali's husband had died in a road accident and the matter was in court. She has been balancing looking after a kid, a new job, and the court case to give justice to her husband by winning case against some rich spate. Unbeknownst to Meghana, Aditya Nagarkar was a friend of Anjali's husband and he was helping her in this court matter. Due to her accommodation problem in Mumbai, Anjali comes and stays in by renting a room in Desaiwadi. Aditya Nagarkar lands there unknowingly. Another complex situation for Desai family but Aditya Desai and Nana, by their sensible handling, settle the matter and make Aditya Nagarkar and Anjali understand that it's time to move on. With this moral boost, Aditya Nagarkar and Anjali decide to tie a knot. This brings an end to the love triangle. During the same time, Meghana receives a transfer to Pune which she accepts. Nana and Maai support this transfer because they feel having been the youngest, they haven't really understood the work that goes in managing a house and they should try living on their own. This upsets Vijaya. Also with a newly established supermarket business, Archana and Vijaya both become too busy to manage the home. Maai also cannot help because of her growing arthritis problems. Everyone notices that Vijaya is upset with Meghana. But cannot do anything about it. But another transfer back to Mumbai, brings Meghana home and makes Vijaya realize her folly.

It is used primarily for treating left-sided breast cancer. The technique involves a patient holding their breath during treatment. In DIBH techniques, treatment is only delivered at certain points in the breathing cycle, where the patient holds their breath. Since the relative positions of organs in the chest naturally changes during breathing, this allows treatment to be delivered to the target (tumour) while other organs are in the optimal position to receive least dose.  Treatment Methods  In the DIBH technique, the patient is initially maintained at quiet tidal breathing (i.e. normal, relaxed breathing), followed by a deep inspiration, a deep expiration, a second deep inspiration, and breath-hold. At this point the patient is at approximately 100% vital capacity, and simulation, verification, and treatment take place during this phase of breath-holding. Patients will have their lung capacity and natural breathing cycle measured so that a comfortable breath-hold capacity can be set. During DIBH, the patient may wear a pair of video goggles which displays their breathing cycle and shows them when they need to inhale and hold their breath. Patients who cannot maintain DIBH can still benefit from lung tracking techniques, for example 4DCT. There are two basic methods of performing DIBH: free-breathing breath-hold, and spirometry-monitored deep inspiration breath hold. =Free-breathing breath-hold= Free-breathing breath-hold, also known as real-time position management (RPM) DIBH utilises an infra-red camera and markers placed on the patient to track movement of their chest, and their breathing. =Spirometry-monitored breath-hold= Spirometry based designs are known as active breathing coordinator (ABC) DIBH systems. ABC utilises a mouth piece for the patient which can be used to control the flow of air to provide more reproducible results. Effectiveness The DIBH technique provides an advantage to conventional free-breathing treatment by decreasing lung density, reducing normal safety margins, and enabling more accurate treatment. These improvements contribute to the effective exclusion of normal lung tissue from the high-dose region and permit the use of higher treatment doses without increased risks of toxicity. Treatment of patients with the DIBH technique is feasible in a clinical setting. With this technique, consistent lung inflation levels are achieved in patients, as judged by both spirometry and verification films. Breathing- induced tumor motion is significantly reduced using DIBH compared to free breathing, enabling better target coverage. Future research  There is currently no clear selection criteria to predict which patients will benefit most from the DIBH technique, other than left breast laterality. There is evidence to suggest parasagittal cardiac contact distance is a promising metric for selection and should be assessed in all future DIBH planning studies.

Work on the dam began in 2004. The dam was completed in April 2010. Main purpose of the dam is flood control, because of flash floods, which occur occasionally in the region (see also 2009 Jeddah floods). Dam Murwani Dam is a 102 (91 or 101) m tall (height above foundation) and 1,012 m long rock-fill embankment dam with a crest altitude of 251 m. The volume of the dam is 6,000,000 m³. The main dam on the right side has a length of 575 m (height 102 m), the saddle dam on the left of 437 m (height 30 m). The dam features a spillway, which is located between the two dams. Impermeability was achieved by using an asphalt-core, for which 80,000 tons of asphalt were used. Reservoir At full reservoir level the reservoir of the dam has a total capacity of 150 mio. m³. The estimated annual contribution into the reservoir is 31 mio. m³; about half of this water will be used at a downstream drinking water treatment plant for potable use. The remaining water will be stored in an aquifer or will be lost to free-surface evaporation.

Publication  It was first published in Krasny Borets on 17 October and in Uralsky Rabochy on 27 October 1943. \\"That Spark of Life\\" was published in mainstream media with an assistance of the Soviet poet Demyan Bedny.Vasilyev, I. \\"Demjan Bednyj i P. P. Bazhov Демьян Бедный и П. П. Бажов [Demyan Bedny and P. P. Bazhov]\\" in: P. P. Bazhov i socialisticheskij realizm. In his letter as of 2 November 1943 to the Ural historian Andrian Pyankov, who had sent him the story, Bedny wrote: > You made me very happy by sending Bazhov's tale \\"That Spark of Life\\". It is > indeed a small masterpiece, a charming little thing! Yesterday I draw the > attention of Pravda's editorial staff to it. If Pravda doesn't publish it, > it's only because they are desperately crammed. But it will probably be > published in Trud. It's more suitable for Trud. I've been itching to write a > foreword to it, but—I'm \\"crammed\\" as well. But I will try. The story is way > too good in form and thought. The story was eventually published in both Pravda and Trud on 21 November 1943. It was later released as a part of The Malachite Box collection in 1944.  Plot  The main character of the story, Timokha Maloruchko (lit. \\"Smallhand\\"), quickly grasps everything that he tries and is good at everything. He decides to try every single local craft. Others try to dissuade him, explaining that no life is long enough and it's better to excel in one craft rather than be Jack of all trades, master of none, but Timokha is adamant. He creates a timetable for himself: two winters to learn logging, two springs for timber rafting, two summers for gold prospecting, a year for mining, ten years for factory work, then farming, hunting, fishing, gem cutting and so on. People laugh at him, but everything goes well, because Timokha is hard-working and smart. He gradually works his way through various professions, marries, has children. One day he decides to try the charcoal burning, although his wife claims that it is dirty work and there's nothing to learn in it. Timokha finds a teacher, the old master Nefyod, who is known for making the best charcoal in the area. Nefyod is very passionate about his profession. He agrees to take an apprentice, but he says that he will teach Timokha all he knowns and hold nothing back on one condition—Timokha will not leave until he can make better charcoal than Nefyod. Timokha agrees to the terms. He watches and learns, and eventually grows fond of both Nefyod and the job. Timokha learns how to make the best charcoal, but, to his own surprise, does not want to leave. Nefyod says: > You'll never go anywhere else now, lad. You're caught wi' the spark of life, > and it'll keep ye till your death. [...] You always looked down, looked at > what ye'd done; but when you started to look up, to look for ways to do it > all better, then that spark caught ye. It's there in every sort of work, it > runs ahead of skilled mastery and beckons a man after it.Bazhov 1950s, p. > 98. Timokha continues to work in the charcoal burning and after Nefyod's death becomes the best charcoal master.  Sources  The charcoal burning was considered a complicated chemical process, many aspects of which were unclear to uneducated or ignorant workers. They believed that mythical creatures were involved, e.g. Zhivinka helped, while Pustodymka (lit. \\"empty smoke\\") or \\"Ognevka\\" (lit. \\"fire girl\\") interfered with the process.Blazhes 1987, p. 20. However the author noted that the supernatural played a bigger part in the miners' lore than in the lore of charcoal burners or blast furnace workers.Blazhes 1987, p. 30. Valentin Blazhes noted that \\"That Spark of Life\\" described the situation similar to the one mention in the article published in the Perm Governorate newspaper after the end of serfdom. There was a custom at the Seversky Pipe Plant of making the workers change their duties very often. For example, a person who worked with an axe \\"today\\", \\"was sent to the iron- smelting plant tomorrow\\", and so on. Thus, a workman during all his life tried everything and excelled in nothing. It was easier and more profitable for the owners because the under-qualified workers were also underpaid.Blazhes 1987, p. 21.  Themes  \\"That Spark of Life\\" is one of the stories published during the Great Patriotic War (1941–1945), when the author switched from supernatural stories based on mythology to realistic and patriotic tales.Kruglova, T. \\"Bazhov i socialisticheskij realizm Бажов и социалистический реализм [Bazhov and socialist realism]\\" in: P. P. Bazhov i socialisticheskij realizm. Bazhov considered it his duty as the patriot. By \\"spark\\" Bazhov meant the creative spark. Bazhov respected skill, hard work, and thirst for knowledge. He believed those were the qualities of the Ural populace. Bazhov noted that he has never seen such cult of craftsmanship, diligence, skill as at the Urals. The topic of masterful craftsmen was one of his favourites.Golovanova, E. \\"Professionalnaja jazykovaja lichnost kak smyslovaja dominanta v skazah P. P. Bazhova Профессиональная языковая личность как смысловая доминанта в сказах П. П. Бажова [The professional language personality as a semantic dominant in P. P. Bazhov's stories]\\" in: P. P. Bazhov i socialisticheskij realizm. Most of his tales were dedicated to the topic of skills, creativity, and virtues of the Ural miners. Bazhov believed that a person can become an expert even when employed in the dirtiest and the most underpaid work. Lidiya Slobozhaninova noted that Bazhov tried to avoid exaggerated dramatism even when writing about such topics as the aspiration for work as a natural quality of human nature. Slobozhaninova commented that Bazhov describes Timokha Maloruchko not with pathos, but with good-natured humour. The teacher who passes on his secrets is always a special character in Bazhov's stories.Ivanikhin, V. \\"Masterstvo kak projavlenie artistizma u geroev skazov P. P. Bazhova Мастерство как проявление артистизма у героев сказов П. П. Бажова [Skill as the manifestation of artistry at the character trait in P. P. Bazhov's skazy]\\" in: P. P. Bazhov i socialisticheskij realizm. The teacher, as the author sees it, should not be blindly followed or copied. He should be someone who can inspire creatively, such as the old master Nefyod. Before meeting him, Timokha tried his hand at everything, but his knowledge was superficial and amateurish, i.e. not a true mastery. Nefyod teaches Timokha to look for the \\"spark\\" in his work. Bazhov believed that every craftsman should be an artist at heart. Similar themes appear in the story \\"Ivanko Krylatko\\".

The reader sees inside Levan and Nunu's head, but never Ana-Maria's, although Ana- Maria seems to vocalize all of her thoughts to Levan. The main protagonist, Levan, has been successful until now, but when he has to confront the fact of his wife leaving him, has also to confront the fact that he has seen her all along as a patient rather than an individual. There is also a sub-plot involving an astrophysicist and a “Visitor”. The narrative crosses several timelines, perspectives and worlds and each chapter is from a different perspective. Tamaz Chiladze focuses on moral problems/issues, arisen as a result of too great a self-assuredness on the part of psychologists. In the novel, the main character is an up-to-now successful psychotherapist Levan, whose wife has left him. One day she suddenly realised that her marriage is nothing more than fact/reality born out of habit and her family is a branch of a hospital. For her husband she wasn't a beloved wife but just a patient. The heroine finds an exit from the vicious circle of misunderstanding and insensitivity.

IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and is effective for most companies that report under IFRS since 1 January 2019. Upon becoming effective, it replaced the earlier leasing standard, IAS 17. IFRS 16 has a substantial impact on the financial statements of lessees of property and equipment – requiring that leases be placed on-balance sheet by recognising a ‘right-of-use’ asset and a lease liability. Motivation to introduce IFRS 16 According to IASB chairman Hans Hoogervorst, “These new accounting requirements bring lease accounting into the 21st century, ending the guesswork involved when calculating a company’s often-substantial lease obligation. The new standard will provide much-needed transparency on companies’ lease assets and liabilities, meaning that off balance sheet lease financing is no longer lurking in the shadows. It will also improve comparability between companies that lease and those that borrow to buy.” Disclosures made by public companies about the impact of IFRS 16 on their financial statements are a point of focus of European financial regulatory authorities. Accounting by lessors IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases. Transition from IAS 17 Lessees are not required to follow the retrospective application requirements of IAS 8. IFRS 16 allows a modified retrospective approach under which comparative periods are not restated. Instead, the cumulative effects of applying IFRS 16 are recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity at the application date. Convergence with US GAAP IFRS 16 was developed in collaboration with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the United States, but while the new FASB leasing standard shares many common features with IFRS 16, such as reporting all large leases on the balance sheet, there will be some significant differences between the two standards. In particular, lessees no longer classify their leases between operating and finance under IFRS 16, but will continue to do so under US GAAP.

She was a Nicaraguan bolero singer, who received more than 400 awards in her lifetime, including the Medal for Artistic Excellence from the Ministry of Culture of Nicaragua. Biography Emma Marina Baltodano Espinales was born on 26 December 1946 in the neighborhood of La Tejera in Managua, Nicaragua to Victoria Espinales. She attended primary school at the Colegio “Evita Perón”, singing pastorals and studying with José Santamaría. She had an opportunity to go to university, but she decided to pursue singing. Her parents were not in favor of that career choice, until her sister intervened and helped her get a job for a radio performance on Radio Managua. After singing in several shows and winning several awards, her parents changed their views. By the early 1960s, she already had a following and in 1965 began appearing on television, performing at various networks, including Teleprensa, Channel 2 and Televicentro of Nicaragua. In 1967, the singer Luís Méndez heard her performance on a show for Latin music fans, produced by Gustavo Latino, on the New World Radio Exchange and Méndez named her the La Gordita de Oro, a nickname which she carried throughout her career. She was instrumental in introducing Nicaraguan romantic music to the international community and was a symbol of Nicaraguan bolero in the 1970s and 1980s. At the height of her fame, she took a private plane to sing at the Irazu Hotel in San José, Costa Rica. Some of her best known recordings include Bienvenido a Nicaragua (Welcome to Nicaragua) by William Bendeck Olivella, La Minifalta by Carlos Mejía Godoy, various works by Ricardo Acosta for his productions with the group \\"Los Gatos de Costa Rica\\" (the cats of Costa Rica), and four songs written by the composer Róger Fischer Sánchez. In the 1980s, she recorded La gloria eres tú for the Sandinista Television System. Her last album, “Vivamos nuestro amor“ was released in April 2014, shortly before her death.

It derives from cross-breeding of local cattle with Swiss Braunvieh stock imported in the nineteenth century through France and through the Val d'Aran. It is distributed throughout the northern comarcas of Catalonia, Alta Ribagorça, Alt Urgell, Berguedà, Cerdanya, Pallars Jussà, Pallars Sobirà, Ripollès, Solsonès and Val d'Aran. The Bruna dels Pirineus constitutes about 80% of the beef herd of Catalonia.  History  The Bruna dels Pirineus derives from cross- breeding of local cattle of the Catalana (now extinct), the Pallaresa and the Pirenaica breeds with Swiss Braunvieh stock imported in the nineteenth century through France and through the Val d'Aran. The first written documentation of these importations is from 1922, but there is evidence going back to 1880 of imports to help satisfy the demand for milk for butter manufacture in Cerdanya. In the 1970s specialised meat breeds, Charolais and Limousin, were imported to Catalonia, but did not adapt successfully to the mountain environment. From the 1980s breeding of the Bruna dels Pirineus, which is well adapted to that environment, began to be oriented more towards meat production. A number of local breeders' associations were formed; a federation of these breeders' associations, the Federació Catalana de la Raça Bruna dels Pirineus, was formed in 1990. In the same year a breed standard was approved and a herd book was established by the Generalitat de Catalunya. The Bruna dels Pirineus breed received official national recognition on 7 November 1997, when it was classified among the breeds \\"at risk of extinction\\" by the Ministerio de Agricultura, Alimentación y Medio Ambiente, the Spanish ministry of agriculture. At the end of 2014 the total population was recorded as 13,542, of which 12,421 were female and 1121 male.  Use and management  The Bruna dels Pirineus, like the Braunvieh, was initially a triple-purpose breed, used as a draught animal and for milk and meat production. It later became dual-purpose, for meat and dairy use, and more recently has become predominantly a meat breed. It constitutes about 80% of the beef herd of Catalonia. Management is generally extensive, with transhumance from the valleys to higher mountain pasture in the summer months.

The church then became a grammar school and is now part of a masonic lodge. The only parts of the church that still remain are the tower and part of the nave. History The church was the oldest church in Abergavenny, with the tower and nave dating from the 14th century. The bell in the tower was rung to signal the start of the curfew when the town gates were closed at night. When the nearby Benedictine priory (dedicated to St Mary) was dissolved in 1536 it only had a prior and four monks and the nave of the priory church was already being used by the people of the town. The people petitioned Henry VIII to make St Mary's the parish church, which happened in 1539. In 1542 or 1543, St John's was seized by Henry VIII to become the King Henry VIII Grammar School which was funded by tithes (taxes) previously paid to St Mary's Priory, and also the tithes from the rectory at Badgeworth, Gloucestershire, previously paid to another Benedictine priory dedicated to St Mary at Usk. The school was the first grammar school in the county. The embattled tower was rebuilt , and was later described as \\"... a curious piece of antiquarianism for the mid C18\\". The building continued as a school until a new building opened in Pen-y-pound in 1998. In 1899 local architect E. A. Johnson (who was a freemason), converted the old school into a masonic lodge, known as the Second Philanthropic Lodge. In 1902 the lodge was renamed to St. John's Lodge, and is now known simply as Abergavenny Masonic Hall or Centre. The lodge holds four masonic certificates (given to new members) from an older (French) masonic lodge in Monk Street. The certificates were issued in 1813 and 1814 to French officers who were prisoners of war sent to Abergavenny. The lodge became a listed building on 5 July 1952 (Cadw building number 2470).

Robusti, also known as Tintoretto or IlFurioso, for the energy and \\"fury\\" with which he painted, depicted both sacred and profane subjects in a period sometimes known as the Venetian “golden century”. Susanna and the Elders (c.1555–56) depicts a scene from the biblical episode of Susanna, from the Book of Daniel. The painting shows Susanna, a young married woman, sitting on the edge of a small pool, preparing to take a bath. She is watched by two elderly men, acquaintances of her husband, who desire her. The lustful elders are depicted in the painting hiding behind a rose trellis in her garden. They are watching and spying on her, trying to find an opportunity to catch her alone in the garden. The story of Susanna and the elders was frequently depicted in art history. The painting is full of symbols. The objects beside the main figure included white pearls, silver jewelry, a silk shawl, and a silver jug. The painting is considered one of Tintoretto's \\"masterpieces\\". Subject According to the story, a young married Jewish woman named Susanna bathed in a pool in her garden every day. One day, two elderly men who were guests of Susanna's wealthy husband Joakim, lusted for Susanna, who was described as \\"The Beautiful Susanna\\". The elderswho were judges and respectable members of the communitycame to an agreement that they would wait until Susanna was alone in the garden and then have their way with her. After Susanna sent away her maids to fetch fragrant oils and perfumes for her bath, the two men rushed forward, propositioning her to have sex with them. They threatened to denounce her if she rejected their advances. Susanna rejected their proposal. The two prominent elders of the community then publicly denounced her, falsely accusing her of committing adultery with a young man. According to ancient Jewish law, adultery was punishable by death, and Susanna was condemned to death after everyone believed the two judges' story. Upset and crying, Susanna was taken away to be executed. She turned to God, calling upon him to prove her innocence. A young man named Daniel was standing in the crowd watching. While witnessing the procession Daniel heard the voice of an angel. The angel urged him to speak up and prevent the killing of an innocent woman who was being framed for doing something she had not done. (The young Daniel would later be known as the prophet Daniel.) The young man, surprised, felt obliged to halt the execution. He asked to be allowed to interrogate the two elders separately so that they could not speak to each other. Daniel then cross-examined the judges on how they had discovered Susanna, what the young man looked like, where they secretly met and so on. He kept receiving contradictory answers from the elders. When asked under which tree Susanna had committed adultery, the two elders gave very different answers and named different kinds of trees. The elderly judges were exposed for lying and for bearing false witnessa capital crime according to ancient Jewish law. Daniel proved Susanna was innocent, and she was freed while the elders were condemned. Painting Susanna and the Elders, detail The painting is a sumptuous work showing a naked Susanna sitting in a garden beside a pool, leaning against a tree, and facing a dense rose trellis, against which leans a mirror. Susanna gazes into the mirror. Around her on the ground are several bright objects including a white silk shawl, pearls, jewelry, a comb, and silverware, which together form a kind of still life. Susanna's body is contrasted in a masterful way against the dark mass of the rose trellis, and the dark water, while the bodies of the three figures form a triangle. Sunlight falls on parts of Susanna's face and body, which Tintoretto has worked out as a chiaroscuro effect. The lines of the slightly forced perspective of the rose trellis draw the viewer into the scene, opening up new vistas through the arch in the background and adding depth to the painting. Two elderly men peer around either end of the rose trellis to watch her. Tintoretto's fascination with materials and colours can be seen in the treatment of the dim silvery light that illuminates Susanna's sumptuous body with crystalline clarity. The light reflects on her complexion and on the small and skillfully painted still life at her feet, contrasting with the rich shadows. Susanna is depicted in a sensual manner with elaborately braided hair. She is sitting absorbed by her reflection in the mirror and unaware of the intruders. The viewer is, of course, well aware of the two men, who seem just about move toward her, releasing the tension of the scene and adding a certain drama to the painting. The rose trellis is set between two trees. The trunk of the front tree extends like a line over the entire height of the image and divides it into two sections: a left one, which only covers about 20 percent of the image area, and a much larger right one, which takes up about 80 percent. A magpie is sitting on a branch to the right above Susanna, behind it one can see a bush of elder. A family of ducks is swimming in the river on the right behind an old man. The narrow garden area with the swimming pool is delimited by a wooden fence in addition to the rose hedge. The poles in the entrance area are designed as caryatides. Through the entrance, the view opens into a spacious garden landscape with a river, meadows and forest. On the river bank in the background you can see a deer and a hind. A closer look reveals the outline of a city surrounded by water, which is most likely the lagoon city of Venice - Tintoretto's home.  Interpretation  J. T .: Susanna and the Elders (detail): deer and hind in the foreground, trees behind and the outline of Venice For his depiction of the subject of the biblical story, Tintoretto chooses a scene in which Susanna seems so absorbed in her reflection that she does not notice the two ambushed, voyeuristic and defamatory old people. In addition, the artist places the act of Susanna so clearly in the spotlight using the technique of chiaroscuro that the viewer himself becomes a voyeur. In order to clarify the moral message contained in the biblical narrative, Tintoretto uses animalContinuum Encyclopedia of Animal Symbolism in World Art. by Hope B. Werness, published by A&C; Black, 01.01.2006. and color symbolism. The magpie stands for the impending defamation, the ducks for loyalty, the roses for lust. The white of the elder flowers and the objects next to Susanna stand for innocence and purity. The red robe of the elders signals danger and lust. The deer stands for desire and lust, Die Dame im Spiel by Ulrike Wörner, pages 144–145, published by Waxmann Verlag, 2010. (German) to be interpreted. The front tree trunk divides the painting into two parts, which could be interpreted as two scenes. The outline-like representation of Venice in the smaller left part of the picture suggests that the bathing Susanna in the larger right part symbolizes the lagoon city of Venice. In addition, the deer as a sign of desire can be seen in connection with the political events at the time of the creation of Tintoretto's painting: Around the middle of the 16th century, Venice was under threat by the Ottoman Empire under Suleiman the Magnificent, because since the Battle of Preveza the Ottoman fleet has become the leading naval power in the Mediterranean Sea.Vier Schiffsgiganten besiegten die türkische Flotte. Article by Berthold Seewald, Die Welt, 04-12-2013. (German)Der Sultan, der Horror und Sex nach Europa brachte. Article by Florian Stark in Die Welt, 06-09-2016. (German) Suleiman's rule even extends to the area of the former Babylon, where the story depicted by Tintoretto has taken place. Accordingly, the two old men in the painting are emblematic of the Ottomans who desire the beautiful, rich city of Venice. With Susanna as a personified representation of Venice and the deer as a symbol of lust, the picture could also be interpreted as a hidden criticism of Venetian society at Tintoretto's time. The numerous prostitutes of the city were made the scapegoats of venereal diseases such as syphilis, which affected Venice in the form of fatal epidemic.Städteführer Venedig MM-City. Teil 9: Prostitution in Venedig vom 13. bis 18. Jahrhundert. – Kampf gegen Zuhälter und Syphilis. by Michael Machatschek, published by Michael Müller-Verlag. 2014. (German) Susanna is considered innocent both in the biblical narrative and in the image of Tintoretto. In a figurative sense, this could mean that Tintoretto does not denounce the prostitutes of Venice, but the men who - despite the threat of infection persistently indulging in their lust - use their services, but shift the blame for sexually transmitted diseases onto women.

He is also a well-known philanthropist.  Early life  Paresky was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1938. He grew up in Burlington, Vermont. Paresky attended Philips Academy on a scholarship before attending Williams College, also as a scholarship student. He graduated from Williams in 1960 and went on to receive his J.D. from Harvard University in 1963 and then his MBA from Harvard in 1965.  Career  Paresky began his tenure in travel services at Philips Academy, where he organized spring break trips to Bermuda for students. Later, Paresky turned this interest into a profitable career. After graduation from Harvard, Paresky began Crimson Travel, a successful company that became the largest travel company in the New England region. Crimson Travel merged with Heritage Travel and then with Thomas Cook Travel, becoming ultimately one of the largest travel companies in the United States. Thomas Cook Travel was founded by Thomas Cook in 1841 in England and survived over the years before moving operations to the United States. American Express purchased Thomas Cook's travel offices in the United States in 1994, which were owned by Paresky and his wife.  Philanthropy  Paresky has donated significant portions of money to both Philips Academy and Williams College in order to build new student facilities. At Williams, the student center built in 2006 is named Paresky Center in his name after he donated $15.75 million to the school. At Philips Academy, Paresky's $10 million donation was used to renovate its main dining hall, renamed Paresky Commons in 2008.  Personal life  Paresky currently lives in Fisher Island, Florida with his wife Linda. He received Williams College's Bicentennial Medal in 2012. Paresky was one of the investors exploited by Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme, which came to light in 2008.

Nikolai was found to have the forbidden substance Trimetazidine in his urine sample which was taken in Kenya on February 5, 2015. Nikolai admitted to taking the drug but claimed he was not aware that it was prohibited during while he was not competing. This was a statement he gave in writing when he provided the original urine sample. The president of the Estonian Athletics Association, Erich Teigamagi stated that it was difficult to examine the matter substantively at the time as Nikolai was not in Estonia at the time. Nikolai notified the Estonian Athletics Association that he was ready to cooperate with them in the probe.

It is located on the north side of a bend in the West River, upriver of the Townshend Dam. The entire village is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the West Townshend Village Historic District. Its ZIP codes are 05359 and 05353. Geography West Townshend is located in central western Townshend. It is located at the northern edge of a bend in the West River, which flows northward from the west, around the bend and then southward to the Townshend Dam, located several miles downriver. The river valley has relatively steep hillsides, with a floodplain that widens at the bend that was deemed suitable for agriculture. Most of the village is strung out along Vermont Route 30, which is aligned to be above the highest waters of Townshend Lake, which was created by the dam. A few town roads extend northward, following branches of Tannery Brook, and an old alignment of VT 30 at the western end of the village also has a few houses. History Townshend was chartered in 1753, but was not settled until the 1760s, after the French and Indian War. Samuel Fletcher, a Massachusetts native, came to the area that is West Townshend, and built the first frame house in Townshend in about 1785, which survives in part in the southeastern part of the village. The village grew around sawmills and gristmills built along Tannery Brook, and reached its height of population and industry in the mid-19th century. The village suffered significant damage in the New England Hurricane of 1938, and was further reduced with the construction of Townshend Dam in the 1950s, which forced a realignment of VT 30. The village was designated a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. It includes, on one of the town roads off VT 30, the West Townshend Stone Arch Bridge, built by Townshend native James Otis Follett in the early 20th century.

They have sloping foreheads, narrow faces which have a rodent quality and mental disabilities. One explanation to the origin of Rats of Shah Dola is a so-called abuse myth. Shah Dola was a saint belonging from Seherwardi School of thought from Aurangzeb's Era, came in Gujrat (Punjab, Pakistan). Shah Dola claimed that he had the power of making incapable women fertile, but at the price that those women had to donate their first born baby to shrine to be a “Rat of Shah Dola,” Otherwise the rest of her children would become disabled. According to the story he deformed children's heads with iron caps to get them to help him by begging, and the practice is continued even today. The gathering of disabled at the shrine of Shah Daulah was probably begun in a charitable spirit. It weakened over time to become a form of exploitation. This activity was later misinterpreted with allegations of 'cranial deformation'. The abuse story has been examined and rebutted by British, Indian and Pakistani investigators, district officers, physicians and anthropologists. The natural occurrence of microcephaly, and innocent local customs of manipulating infants' heads for beauty, give explanation. However, some exploitation of people with microcephaly did happen at the shrine and the government took control of it in 1969. Begging continues within the religious tradition of the itinerant 'faqir', and some microcephalic adults earn their living independently in this role. Nowadays there are thousands of disabled children at the shrine.

Asadi Tusi completed the poem in 1066 AD and dedicated it to a certain Abū Dolaf, the ruler of Nakjavān (nothing is known about him). The poem is also translated to other languages such as French and German. It seems that Asadi Tusi wrote this poem based on a written source. Like Shahname, it contains few Arabic loan- words and consists of some 9,000 verses. The main hero of this epic poem is Garshasp, the son of Etret, and grandson of Šam. The poem begins with the story of Jamshid and Zahhak. Jamshid is overthrown by Zahhak and flees to Zabolistan. In Zabolistan, Jamshid falls in love with an unnamed daughter of Kurang, the king of Zabolistan, and she bore a child for Jamshid, named Tur (not to be confused with Tur, the son of Freydun).

He has been compared to Karl May. Biography Robert Kraft was born in Leipzig as the son of a wine merchant. His parents were divorced early. In high school he was expelled due to his absenteeism. On the orders of his father, Kraft trained as a locksmith and in 1887 attended the Königliche Höhere Gewerbeschule (Royal Higher Vocational School) in Chemnitz. In 1889, he stole a sum of money from his father and was arrested a short time later. In Hamburg he hired on the ship Shakespeare, and near Greenland it capsized. After the rescue, he worked on other ships around the world, and in 1890 ended up in Egypt, where he eked out a living doing odd jobs and lived with an Egyptian woman in the desert. He went as a stowaway on a ship to Constantinople and became ill with cholera. The German Consulate in Constantinople asked Kraft to complete his military service as soon as possible, so he went to Wilhelmshaven and served three years in the Imperial Navy. By his own account, he spent most of his time in the camp with discarded books from ships' libraries and found plenty of time for reading. Subsequently, he returned to Egypt to be with desert hunters. In the Libyan desert he met with Rifa'i - dervishes, during which he worked intensively with supernatural phenomena. At the same time he had to admit that he was not cut out for an adventurous life far from European amenities. As reconciliation with his father in Germany failed, he moved to London and in 1895 married Johanna Rehbein. The couple had two daughters. Kraft made contacts with Münchmeyer Publishing House in Dresden, which would publish his Kolportage novels. The commitment of the publishing house led him to return home to Germany in 1896. When his father later died, Kraft inherited his considerable fortune. In 1902 he traveled with his family to Monte Carlo, then to London where within a year he lost all his assets. Penniless, he moved again to Germany to write popular fiction, lived in Kleinzschachwitz in Dresden, Friedrich Hagen, Bad Schandau, Dresden and Hamburg.

Career Horst Helle received a business degree from the university in his hometown of Hamburg before receiving an MBA from the University of Kansas on a Fulbright Scholarship, 1956-1957.Horst Helle website - Curriculum vitae Thereupon, he returned to the University of Hamburg and obtained the Ph.D. in sociology as well as the license to teach sociology as Privatdozent. He has since held tenured professorships at the RWTH Aachen University, the University of Vienna, and the University of Munich where, between 1973 and 2002, he was Professor of Sociology and Co-director of the Institute for Sociology. Over the course of his career, Helle has also taught at universities in several other countries, including a year as a research fellow at the University of Chicago and, since 1996, in mainland China.H.J. Helle - Author information Contributions to sociology Helle's work is mainly concerned with analyzing the development of Symbolic Interactionism since Herbert Blumer, although he does not single out Blumer's contribution. Instead the latter is positioned and discussed in the context of the evolution of the so-called 'Verstehen' tradition of interpretive sociology. Helle has specifically looked at the path taken by European sociology in its tension between positivism and neo-Kantianism since the writing of Georg Simmel. He connects this tradition to Blumer's indebtedness to George Herbert Mead, the widely acknowledged “father” of Symbolic Interactionism. In this theoretical continuity Helle also discusses the work of Anselm Strauss, Tamotsu Shibutani and, particularly, Erving Goffman.

The painting is in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, in Philadelphia. The painting depicts a scene of nude women bathing. In the foreground, two women are seated beside the water, and a third is standing in the water near them. In the background, two others are bathing. The one standing in the water in the foreground appears to be about to splash one of the women seated on the shore with water. That woman leans back to avoid the expected splash of water. The figures have a sculptural quality, while the landscape behind them shimmers with impressionistic light. With this new style, Renoir's intention was to reconcile the modern forms of painting with the painting traditions of the 17th and 18th centuries, particularly those of Ingres and Raphael. Renoir also admired Rubens and Titian's works, and he tried to find a compromise between the styles of these old masters and the new impressionist style. Painting It is inspired at least in part by a sculpture by François Girardon, The Bath of the Nymphs (1672), a low lead relief realized for a fountain park of Versailles. It also reflects the influence of the works of Ingres, and particularly the frescoes of Raphael, whose style he had absorbed during his trip to Italy. These two great artists influenced Renoir's entire way of painting and drawing: he began to paint in a more disciplined and more conventional manner, gave up painting outdoors, and made the female nude – until then only an occasional subject– his main focus. Renoir worked on The Bathers for three years until he was content with its composition. During that time, he made numerous studies and sketches, including at least two full-sized figure drawings of the theme. The Bathers may also be regarded as Renoir's pictorial testament. The models for the three bathers included two of his favorites: Aline Charigot, the blonde sitting behind, whom Renoir married in 1890, and Suzanne Valadon, herself a painter and the mother of Maurice Utrillo. After completing The Large Bathers, Renoir received severe criticism because of his new style. Tired and disillusioned, he never again created paintings of this caliber. A similar subject later appeared in a series of paintings by Paul Cezanne.

This accord was signed by then President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, and the leader of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) Foday Sankoh. The aims of the Commission were to establish \\"an impartial historical record of violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law related to the armed conflict in Sierra Leone from the beginning of the Conflict in 1991 to the signing of the Lomé Peace Agreement; to address impunity, to respond to the needs of the victims, to promote healing and reconciliation and to prevent a repetition of the violations and abuses suffered.\\" The Commission was chaired by Bishop Joseph Christian Humper. It operated from 2002-2004, with a final report being presented to the United Nations Security Council on October 5, 2004.  History of the Conflict  The Sierra Leone Civil War began on March 23, 1991. The Revolutionary United Front, supported by the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, attempted to overthrow the Joseph Momoh government. This attempt resulted in a civil war that lasted 11 years, leaving over 50,000 dead.  Commissioners  * Bishop Christian Humor - Chairman * Hon. Justice Laura Marcus-Jones - Deputy Chairperson * Professor William Schabas * Ms. Yasmin Louise Sooka * Mr. Sylvanus Torto * Madam Ajaratu Satang Jow * Professor John Kamara  Mandate  The commission's mandate was to \\"provide a degree of accountability for human rights abuses committed during the conflict.\\" Below is a brief summary of its mandate. * To construct an impartial historical record of violations and abuses of human rights during the armed conflict in Sierra Leone. * To address impunity, to respond to the needs of the victims, to promote healing and reconciliation, and to prevent a repetition of the violations and abuses suffered. * To investigate and report on the causes, nature, and extent of violations and abuses to the highest possible degree in order to determine a proper course of action for reconciliation purposes. * To help restore the dignity of the victims, and to provide an opportunity for healing and reconciliation between the victims and those who carried out the abuses. The commission also strove to give special attention to victims of sexual abuse and to children who were either victims or perpetrators.  Findings  A major task of Sierra Leone's Truth Commission was to interview victims on both sides of the conflict and report on what they found. The commission reported a number of findings, including: * The conflict and post-independence period preceding it represent the most shameful years of Sierra Leone’s history. This conflict reflects an extraordinary failure of leadership individuals amongst the government, society, and public. * The central cause of the war was endemic greed, corruption, and nepotism that deprived the nation of its dignity and reduced its citizens to a state of poverty. * Government accountability was non-existent, and the institution designed to uphold human rights was co-opted by the executive. * Both sides of the conflict specifically targeted civilians. * The Sierra Leone civil war was characterized by indiscriminate violence. It broke long-standing rules, defiled cherished traditions, sullied human respect and tore apart the very fabric of society. * Children aged between ten and 14 years were especially targeted for forced recruitment. Girls between the ages of ten and 14 were targeted for rape and for abuse as sexual slaves. These women were also tortured and suffered cruel and inhumane acts. * The leadership of the Revolutionary United Front and the Government of Sierra Leone are responsible for either authorising or instigating human rights violations against civilians. They also stand accused of failing to stop such atrocities, and for failing to acknowledge the occurrence of these atrocities. * Contrary to popular belief, the exploitation of diamonds did not cause the conflict in Sierra Leone. However, various factions targeted diamondiferous areas in order to gain wealth to support their war efforts. * The right to the truth is inalienable. This right should be upheld in terms of national and international law. It is the reaching of the wider truth through broad-based participation that permits a nation to examine itself honestly and to take effective measures to prevent a repetition of the past. For a complete list of the Truth Commission's findings, see chapter 2 of the full report, available here.  Reparations  The Reparations section of the Truth Commission is aimed at creating a reparations program for the victims of the Sierra Leonean conflict. Such a program is difficult to create as there are a number of victims on both sides of the conflict, as well as a number of different crimes committed by both sides. Because of this, the Commission had to determine who would benefit from a reparations program. > In designing a reparations programme for the victims of the Sierra Leonean > conflict, the Commission had to take into account a number of factors. It > would have been gratifying if all victims of the conflict could benefit from > a reparations programme but such a programme would be totally impossible for > the country to implement. The Commission therefore had to determine who > would benefit from a reparations programme. The Commission determined the > category of beneficiaries by considering those victims who were particularly > vulnerable because of the human rights violations they had suffered and the > harm that they continued to live with. It is important to note that the TRC Act did not explicitly use the term \\"reparations\\". Instead, they were instructed to \\"address the needs of the victims,\\" and restore the human dignity of victims\\" as well as \\"promote healing and reconciliation.\\"  Recommendations  The Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act of 2000 requires any commission to make recommendations concerning the reforms and measures needed to achieve the object of the commission. These recommendations are crucial in order to promote the healing process for the nation after the conflict. In the case of the Sierra Leone commission, the reparations are aimed at the \\"building of a new Sierra Leone based on the values of human dignity, tolerance and respect for the rights of all persons.\\" The main recommendations of the commission were: * The commission found that due to a lack of visionary leadership, there was no one to steer the country away from its slide into chaos and civil war. Because of this, the commission called on leaders from all levels of Sierra Leonean society to commit themselves to employing better forms of leadership. * The central cause of the war was endemic greed, corruption and nepotism, which deprived the nation of its dignity and forced its citizens into poverty. The commission calls upon all members in the private sector to work together and usher in a new culture of ethics and to fight the \\"scourge of corruption which saps the life-force of Sierra Leone.\\" * The commission also recommended the implementation of a more modern human rights culture in which all \\"Sierra Leoneans respect each other's human rights, without exception.\\" Therefore, the creation of a new constitution was also recommended. In the commission's words: \\"A Sierra Leone that is united around clear constitutional rights, values and principles has a promising future.\\" * Due to a severe lack of governmental accountability, democracy and the rule of law had ceased to exist. Therefore, the commission recommended that Sierra Leone must strengthen its institutions of accountability. For a complete list of the commission's recommendations, see Chapter 2 of the full report, available here.  Criticisms  In her book Unspeakable Truths: Facing the Challenge of Truth Commissions, Priscilla B. Hayner examines various truth commissions, one of which is the commission for Sierra Leone. One of her main criticisms of the report was the government's inability to enact many of the commission's recommendations. The \\"government was required to submit public quarterly reports on the actions it had taken to fulfill the recommendations.\\" The government made slow but eventual progress in the implementation of the commission's recommendations. Hayner also points out a common criticism facing many truth commissions; the need for \\"social forgetting\\". Many citizens in Sierra Leone felt that social forgetting was crucial to the process of healing and reconciliation. Unfortunately, many citizens were not able to simply forget, as they were pressured into making official statements to the commission regarding their experiences during the Civil War.

The painting was one of seven altarpieces commissioned in March 1767 from Tiepolo by King Charles III of Spain for the Church of Saint Pascual in Aranjuez, then under construction. This was originally an Alcantarine (Franciscan) monastery that was later assigned to the Conceptionist nuns. The painting was commissioned in 1767, at a time when the Immaculate Conception was already a common theme in art, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception (8 December) having been restored to the Calendar of Saints in 1708, though its theology would not be definitely settled as dogma until Pope Pius IX's declaration in 1854. It represents the Immaculate Conception, a tradition of the Catholic Church stating that the Virgin Mary was conceived without original sin. It depicts the Virgin Mary, surrounded by angels and crowned with the circle of stars. She is shown trampling a snake, representing her victory over the devil. The lilies and the rose are references to hortus conclusus (\\"enclosed garden\\"), and symbolize Mary's love, virginity and purity. The painting is now in the Prado Museum, Madrid.Christiansen, Keith, ed. Giambattista Tiepolo, 1696–1770. Exhibition catalogue - No. 40b pp. 242-7. New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1996. Tiepolo's altarpieces were transferred to the adjoining convent soon after they were installed in the church. They were replaced by an identically themed set by Anton Raphael Mengs, whose neo-classicism was more to Charles III's taste. Finally The Immaculate Conception was transferred to the Prado Museum in 1827. Painting The imposing Baroque style of the painting is meant to evoke emotion. It was completed between 1767 and 1768. The depiction of the Virgin Mary is done according to traditional Christian iconography, and represents her Immaculate Conception, free from original sin. Standard iconographic elements include the dove above her, the stars around her head, her position on the crescent moon with a snake crushed under her feet, her hands held together in prayer, and the obelisk on her right. Allegory of the Immaculate Conception, , National Gallery of Ireland Modello, 1767, Courtauld Institute of Art Additional iconography which accords to this theme include clouds, cherubs, lilies and a pink rose, flowers which are often associated with Mary. The dove above her head symbolizes the Holy Ghost, while the rose and the lilies are her customary symbols, lilies representing her purity, while the rose is the symbol for Mary, Queen of heaven and earth.Koehler, S.M., Rev. Theodore A., \\"The Christian Symbolism of the Rose\\" ,Divine Mirrors: The Virgin Mary in the Visual Arts by Melissa R. Katz and Robert A. Orsi 2001 page 98 Her girdle should be the cord of St. Francis. The globe symbolizing the whole world, the crescent moon and the starry crown above her head are traditional symbols of the \\"woman clothed with the sun\\" (Virgo in Sole) described in Revelations 12:1-2. The crescent moon itself is an ancient symbol of chastity deriving from the Roman goddess Diana. Just as the moon derives its light from the sun, so Mary's special grace derives from the merits of Christ, her Son. The obelisk to her right also shimmers in the light of the sun and references traditional symbols of the Immaculate Conception associated with the Tower of David and the Ivory Tower, evoking impregnability, virginity and purity. Mary is depicted as trampling a serpent holding an apple in its mouth, representing the serpent in the Garden of Eden and Original Sin. A palm branch, and a mirror are seen under her feet. The palm branch signifies Mary's victory and exaltation, the mirror her purity. Originating in Spain with Francisco Pacheco, the popularity of this particular representation of The Immaculate Conception spread across Europe.Our Lady in Art by Katherine Lee Rawlings Jenner 2009 pages 3-9 Tiepolo had painted an earlier version of the Immaculate Conception in 1734 for the Franciscan church of Santa Maria in Araceli in Vicenza. That version depicted the Virgin Mary as a beautiful young girl in the manner already established by Guido Reni and Bartolomé Esteban Murillo following Pacheco. The painting is now in Vicenza's civic museum at the Palazzo Chiericati. In the present version the depiction of Mary is rather more majestic and solemn in keeping with the Alcantarine tradition of austerity. Tiepolo painted a set of five modelli for his altarpieces. These are now all at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London and are considered amongst his finest work. The modello for the Immaculate Conception differs from the final version in several respects. In the final version the figure of Mary occupies more space and lacks the muscular supporting angel on her left. That angel is thought to be a representation of the archangel Michael whose slaying of Lucifer prefigured Mary's role as an instrument of salvation. The angel is present in an oil sketch executed around the same time, now in the National Gallery of Ireland, considered iconographically the most complex of Tiepolo's depictions of the Immaculate Conception. Note the triangular halo signifying the Trinity. Background Baroque art was meant to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance. Tiepolo's works, many of which are on an imposing scale, are also characterized by tension, exuberance, hedonism and intricate designs. Among Tiepolo's most popular works are mythological and religious themes conveying an atmosphere of grandeur and beauty. Provenance * Church of S. Pascual Baylon, Aranjuez (1770–1775) * Convent of S.

The realisation of the script is based on the French novel La mort est mon métier by Robert Merle, which was published in 1952 (English edition: Death Is My Trade). Like the novel, the film is partly based on interrogation records of the trial against Rudolf Höß, SS-officer and commander of the Nazi concentration and extermination camp Auschwitz, as well as on his autobiographical notes. He made these notes first during his time as British POW, then, after he was extradited, as Polish prisoner in 1946/47, before he was executed as a convicted war criminal. Instead of using the name Rudolf Höß, whose life was the model for the film, the pseudonym Franz Lang is used, in order that he remain anonymous. The real Rudolf Höß had gone into hiding allegedly working as a boatman after World War II using this (fake) name until he was unmasked and arrested in 1946. The film is divided into 14 different episodes, which describe fragmentary and important scenes of Franz Lang's (alias Rudolf Höss) life. Cast * Götz George as Franz Lang * Hans Korte as Heinrich Himmler  Plot  Franz Lang, born in 1900, tries to get to the front line during World War I when he is a teenager - at first unsuccessfully. Finally, he volunteers to work at a military hospital, where he gets to know injured Hauptmann Günther. In their interactions, the German Army officer explains to him the only sin: not being a \\"good German\\" - a key sentence for Lang and his future life. The officer promises young Franz to take him into his newly founded regiment. In 1917 Franz Lang serves at the front, which he had long desired, under the command of Captain Günther: Joining three of his comrades Franz is to take machine gun position and has to experience the death of two of his comrades. The third tries to convince Franz of desertion, but he wants to fulfill the wish of his group leader, who had just died, to stay in machine gun position as long as possible, and so kills the deserter. Severely wounded carrying his machine gun Franz Lang drags himself behind the front line, where he is found unconscious by Captain Günther. Later he promotes him to the rank of non-commissioned officer, as Franz Lang is the only survivor of the hopeless battle. Even after the war, during the Weimar Republic Lang maintains his devotion to duty and subservience to authority which is why he often gets into trouble in civil life: In 1919 he finds work in a machine factory with the help of a comrade, but soon he gets fired after a conflict with his elderly college, who struggles with Lang's pace of work, following pressure from the staff and the worker's council. After his dismissal Franz Lang gets involved in national circles. As a result, he joins the extreme right-wing , which intervenes at the Ruhr Uprising against left-wing revolutionary workers in the Baltic states and at other occasions. In a group of arrested insurgents he recognizes a former wartime comrade, who Lang supports at first. He points out at his commander that his comrade was very committed at the front and that he was awarded the Iron Cross. The commander of the unit convinces Franz Lang that they are communists and that he can not relate to them as comrades anymore. He says that they are ideologically blinded by \\"Jewish-Marxist agitators\\" and that orders are always binding and have to be carried out even against personal interests. Franz Lang is finally content with this explanation and when his former comrade later tries to flee, he shoots him. After the dissolution of the Freikorps Lang finds a job as a construction worker. He uses his first wage in order to pay his debts to his comrades, and so he has hardly any money left to live off. In addition, he is overwhelmed by the physical effort so much that he, under the impression that he isn't able to fulfill his obligation, despairs. Lang decides to end his own life on his own terms. Before he shoots himself with his Mauser pistol, one of his fellow construction workers visits him: He instantly guesses what Lang is about to do and warns him to stay loyal to Germany and that he is burdened with the responsibility for this country, even though he may no longer be a soldier. Lang's colleague, whom Lang suspects to be a member of the NSDAP, leaves him with a pamphlet called Völkischer Beobachter. Impressed by the fighting talk used in the pamphlet, Franz Lang decides to join the NSDAP, too. In 1922 Franz Lang visits a (Sturmlokal) belonging to the local SA: He tells the SA-Obersturmführer that he wants to have responsibility and help Germany rise to power again. As he is filling in the form required for a member ID card and admission, the 'Obersturmführer' explains to him that he has been accepted into the SA and that he would receive a preliminary ID card, as he is related to Roßbach. Lang assures him that he absolved all the combat missions after the war. However, he couldn't afford a SA-Uniform. The SA leader in response to this leaves him with the uniform of a SA man who was shot. As a member of the NSDAP and SA, Franz Lang responds to a call for a group of soldiers, from a couple of landlords who want their land protected. Franz Lang is stationed there, together with a couple of his comrades, when the former treasurer of the Freikorps appears in town. He had stolen the free corps funds several years earlier, run off, but now appeared in Mecklenburg. During a drinking session Franz Lang uncovers the alleged Communist Party of GermanyKPD membership of one former free corps comrade. The free corps members present at the meeting abduct and beat up the alleged traitor in a forest and Franz Lang shoots him. One frightened person involved in the murders reveals the crime to the authorities and in 1924 Franz Lang is sentenced to ten years in prison. In prison he reads Hitler's \\"Mein Kampf\\" and becomes a fanatic Nazi. After almost five years, Lang is released in 1928 as a result of an Amnesty. In his social reintegration the NSDAP helps him in finding employment on the land of a party friend: the former colonel Baron of Jeseritz. He is soon very impressed by Lang's services and supports him further: He leaves him with a neglected farm that he may autonomously administer and advises him to marry Else, who was chosen by the baron himself, because she conforms to Aryan female standards. Lang does as he is told and marries Else. At a party held later at the farm he meets Heinrich Himmler, who claims to have heard of Lang's reliability and organisational skills. Franz Lang receives an order from Himmler himself to organise a cavalry division, which is later to become the Schutzstaffel. When the National Socialists gain power over the Republic, Lang becomes an Unterscharführer with the SS riders, and in 1934 SS Reich leader Himmler offers him an administrative post at the Dachau concentration camp close to Munich. Even though he and his wife would prefer to carry on working in agriculture, Lang accepts the offer as a \\"commitment to the party and the homeland\\" which Himmler approves. Lang points out to his wife that the SS Reich Leader had chosen him particularly because of these organisational skills and his experience as a prisoner. After all, he himself had been imprisoned for five years. In the Dachau concentration camp Franz Lang is finally trained to be the future camp commander. He fulfils his duties without protest and, as years go by, he is promoted to the rank of SS- Sturmbannführer. During World War II Lang is once again summoned to Himmler who informs him, under strict confidentiality, about Hitler's plan to annihilate the Jews in the holocaust and about the camps, which are planned in Poland. As a result, Lang takes over the Auschwitz extermination camp in Poland, which is now occupied by the Germans. Adolf Eichmann informs him about the \\"capacities\\" of the camp. Until then, according to the party leadership the killings were too ineffective. More or less incidentally, Lang develops the idea of using the poison cyclone B as a \\"hygienically clean\\" and \\"effective\\" solution to gas the Jews who are deported to Auschwitz. Because he implements this method successfully in the camp, he is promoted to the rank of SS-Obersturmbannführer after Himmler has visited him there. During a meal with the head of the Chelmno concentration camp Lang's wife Else finds out what is going on in the camp and when she tackles him he defends himself by saying it is his duty. He does not contradict his wife when she assumes that he would also kill their children if he was told to. He even admits that he would do so. He argues that he is not responsible for what he does in the camp, as he is following orders given by his superiors. At the end of the war Lang hides out at a farm in the American occupation zone. He is found by American soldiers and subsequently imprisoned. During an interrogation, when Lang is asked by a US officer whether he thinks that the eradication of the Jews was right, he says: \\"It is not relevant what I believe, I only obeyed.\\" Franz Lang is extradited to Poland where he is sentenced to death and subsequently hung in Auschwitz.

The Q20A/B terminates in College Point at the north end of Queens. The Q44 continues north into the borough of the Bronx, terminating in the West Farms neighborhood near the Bronx Zoo. The Q44 is one of two Queens bus routes to operate between the two boroughs (along with the ). The Q44 and Q20 were originally operated by the North Shore Bus Company from the 1930s to 1947; they are now operated by MTA Regional Bus Operations under the New York City Transit brand. In June 1999, the Q44 began limited stop service in Queens, with the Q20 split into two branches to provide local service. On November 29, 2015, the Q44 was converted into a Select Bus Service (SBS) route. Route description and service=Q44= The current Q44 route begins at the intersection of Merrick Boulevard and Archer Avenue in Downtown Jamaica, Queens (or Jamaica Center), just south of the 165th Street Bus Terminal. This terminus is shared with the . Traveling west along Archer Avenue, it passes the Jamaica Center station of the Archer Avenue subway and its bus terminal. At the Sutphin Boulevard subway station, which connects to the Jamaica station of the Long Island Rail Road and AirTrain JFK, the route turns north onto Sutphin Boulevard. It then turns west onto Hillside Avenue and north onto Queens Boulevard, interchanging with two stations of the IND Queens Boulevard Line. At Main Street the Q44 turns north, running the entire distance of the street between Queens Boulevard and Northern Boulevard in Downtown Flushing (also known as Flushing Chinatown). In Downtown Flushing is the Flushing–Main Street terminal, where several bus lines, the IRT Flushing Line subway, and the LIRR Port Washington Branch interchange. The Q44 shifts onto Union Street and Parsons Boulevard to 14th Avenue in Whitestone. It then enters the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge, sharing the bridge with the . Throughout Queens, the Q44 provides limited-stop service, making intermittent stops primarily at major intersections and points of interest. After entering the Bronx, the Q44 and Q50 follow the Hutchinson River Parkway service road to just south of the Bruckner Interchange, making only two stops: one at Lafayette Avenue, and another one at Brush Avenue and Bruckner Blvd, where passengers can also connect to the bus. While the Q50 turns east to follow the Bx5, the Q44 turns west onto East 177th Street (the Cross Bronx Expressway service road), running along either direction of the road. At the Parkchester subway station, the Q44 goes around the Hugh J. Grant Circle. The Q44 continues along East 177th Street until the interchange with the Sheridan Expressway, where it turns north onto Devoe Avenue. The Q44 stops at East Tremont Avenue near the West Farms Square subway station, and terminates at East 180th Street at the southern boundary of the Bronx Zoo. Buses lay over on a bridge over the Bronx River, before reentering service on Boston Road. Although the Q44's northern terminal is signed as \\"Bronx Zoo\\" (formerly \\"Bronx Zoo − West Farms Square\\"), the zoo is not accessible from this location; the closest entrance is several blocks north at Bronx Park South and Boston Road. Prior to 1999, the Q44 ran entirely local between Jamaica, Queens and West Farms, Bronx. It was the only bus service along Main Street in Queens. Before the implementation of Select Bus Service in November 2015, the route ran entirely local along East 177th Street. Now it employs an equivalent to limited-stop service on East 177th Street, but with no additional local route operating along the street. Select Bus Service stops=Q20A/B= The Q20A and B services share the same routing as the Q44 between Jamaica and Whitestone, before diverging west towards their shared terminal in College Point near Flushing Bay. The Q20A branches off at 20th Avenue, running along the northern edge of the former Flushing Airport and serving a large shopping center. This route is shared with the . The Q20B turns west farther north at 14th Avenue, running through a much more residential area. Both the 20th and 14th Avenue routes were part of the original Q20, which only ran between College Point and Downtown Flushing. Both routes provide local service, but the Q20A runs at all times, while the Q20B operates only on weekdays. History= Original route = Q44 Nova Bus articulated buses in Flushing, Queens in July 2015, five months before implementation of Select Bus Service. On February 15, 1932, North Shore Bus Company began operating a bus service to replace the Long Island Rail Road's Whitestone Branch. This service was labeled the \\"Q35\\". This service was different from the current service between Brooklyn and Rockaway Park. It ran from the Flushing–Main Street terminal, north along Linden Street (now Linden Place) and 127th Street to 14th Avenue through Flushing and College Point. This is the routing of the current bus in the area. The original Q35 then ran east along 14th Avenue before following the current and routes to Whitestone. On May 2, 1933, North Shore Bus began a shuttle service along Main Street between Main Street/Roosevelt Avenue subway station in Flushing and Horace Harding Boulevard (now the Long Island Expressway) in Queensboro Hill. This was the predecessor to Q44 service. At the time, Main Street had yet to be extended south past Reeves Avenue (the north end of modern Queens College). On September 22, 1935 the North Shore Bus Company acquired, but did not merge with, the Flushing Heights Bus Corporation which operated the and the services between Jamaica and Flushing. North Shore only acquired the Q25 on a temporary basis; as compensation, the city assured the company that they would get a new route between Flushing and Jamaica via Main Street. This was planned to go into service after the extension of Main Street, including a bridge over the Grand Central Parkway, was completed. In 1937, several major bus route changes occurred. Queens–Nassau Transit took over the Q25 service and combined it with their Q34 route along Linden Place and 127th Street in College Point (predecessor to the northern portion of the current Q25). The Q35 was discontinued by North Shore, and was replaced by a new Q20 service. The route of the Q20 was the same as the current route of the Q20B (via 14th Avenue), except that it continued north along 122nd Street (now College Point Boulevard) and followed the same looping route as the current Q25 (then Q34) near MacNeil Park at the north end of the borough. = Start of Q44 service = In December 1936, North Shore applied for a franchise on route \\"Q-44\\" between Flushing and Jamaica via Main Street. On March 22, 1938, Q44 service began between Flushing–Main Street and Archer Avenue at the Jamaica Long Island Rail Road station, when Main Street was extended south to the Grand Central Parkway. The company advertised the route as the shortest \\"from the entire North Shore\\" of Queens to Jamaica, running 15 minutes between terminals. Following the opening of the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge in April 1939, North Shore began operating bus service between West Farms Square in the Bronx and the 1939 New York World's Fair in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park on July 1 of that year. On October 28, 1940, this route was combined with the Q44, running from Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike station (along the route that would become the ) through Whitestone and along East 177th Street in the Bronx to Tremont Avenue and Boston Road at West Farms Square. An alternate branch ran to Westchester Square, Bronx. By December of that year, the Q44 returned to Jamaica, running to the 165th Street Bus Terminal. A College Point-bound Q20A in Downtown Jamaica. On July 1, 1939, the Q20 became interlined with the Q17, meaning that south of Flushing the bus would continue via the Q17 route to the Jamaica−165th Street terminal. The service was designated \\"Q17-20\\" or \\"Q20-17\\" and rollsigns would display Q17/20.Q17/20 Rollsign Beginning on June 8, 1942 due to restrictions on gasoline and tire usage during World War II, the service was truncated to 14th Avenue and 122nd Street in College Point. Service north of 14th Avenue was restored on February 4, 1946. The Q20 was separated from the Q17 during off-peak \\"base period\\" hours on January 27, 1947. In March of that year, North Shore Bus would be taken over by the New York City Board of Transportation (later the New York City Transit Authority), making the bus routes city operated. The joint Q17-20 service later became popular among students of St. John's University, and residents from Jamaica Estates and Flushing Heights (now Kew Gardens Hills) shopping in Downtown Flushing. On February 3, 1957, the Transit Authority separated the Q17 and Q20 services at all times, eliminated service north of 14th Avenue and 122nd Street (College Point Boulevard), and renamed the Q20 the Q44FS (Flushing Shuttle). It was one of several routes using the \\"Q44\\" designation including the Q44 itself, the Q44A (now the ), the Q44B (a shuttle to Malba, Queens which has since been discontinued), and the Q44VP (later the Q74). During the 1964 New York World's Fair, special Q44 service was inaugurated, running to the Rodman Street entrance of Flushing Meadows Park. The routes, designated \\"Q44 WF\\" and marked \\"World's Fair\\", originated from either West Farms Square or 165th Street and made stops on the Bronx or Queens portions of the route respectively before terminating at the fair. = Reroutes and institution of limited-stop service = On April 15, 1990, the Q44FS was renumbered to Q20; at this time 20th Avenue service began, when the street was widened and the shopping center was constructed. In September 1995, weekend service was eliminated on the Q20, making it a weekday-only service. On January 11, 1998, the Q44 began running on Archer Avenue between Merrick Boulevard and Sutphin Boulevard in both directions to provide direct access to the Long Island Rail Road's Jamaica station and to eliminate difficult turns on congested streets. A new turnaround loop was set up using Archer Avenue, 168th Street, Jamaica Avenue, and Merrick Boulevard. Previously, southbound buses ran along Jamaica Avenue until Merrick Boulevard, and northbound buses ran along Archer Avenue and 153rd Street until they turned onto Jamaica Avenue. This change was presented to the MTA Board for approval in November 1997, and was initially going to take effect in December 1997.  On June 27, 1999, the Q44 began limited-stop service in Queens, with the Q20 split into two branches (Q20A and Q20B) to provide local service, with the Q20B providing service along the old Q20 route on 14th Street, and the Q20A providing new service along 20th Avenue. The addition of service along 20th Avenue was done at the request of owners of commercial developments on the avenue, such as BJ's and Target. Weekend service was also restored on the Q20A. Since the Q44 became limited, the Q20 was extended south along Main Street to make local stops. Prior to the change, Q20 service had run during weekdays only from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. and ran at frequencies of 15 to 30 minutes. At this time, the Q44 was shifted from its historical route in the neighborhood of Briarwood between Union Turnpike and Hillside Avenue. It had previously turned east onto the Grand Central Parkway service road and then turned south onto 150th Street towards Jamaica, the same route employed since 1938 when Main Street dead- ended at the Grand Central service road. It was rerouted to continue south via Main Street, and then via Queens Boulevard to Hillside Avenue. Initially, Q44 buses made limited stops from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays, from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturdays, and from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Sundays. The changes in service on the Q44 and Q20 were made to increase ridership growth and to serve new markets. On July 29, 1999, a meeting was held at Borough Hall, with officials of the MTA in attendance, to discuss the changes. Many riders spoke against the changes, noting that the change made it harder for senior citizens and people with disabilities who had used the stops along 150th Street, and that the change added an additional transfer to complete their trips, requiring an additional fare. A spokesperson for the MTA said that it had no plans to revert the change in service, and noted that the areas on Queens Boulevard and Main Street that the Q44 was rerouted to had increased in density. Briarwood residents had organized and circulated a petition in opposition to the loss of bus service on 150th Street soon after the changes took effect. This change was announced to elected officials in late March 1999, and was approved by the MTA Board on April 15, 1999. On April 1, 2005, Q44 limited-stop service at Main Street and Sanford Avenue was discontinued, with service continuing to be provided by the Q20A and Q20B. =Select Bus Service and service expansion= St George's Church in 2016 In 2004 and 2006, the Main Street corridor was identified as a potential route for Flushing-Jamaica bus rapid transit (BRT) service, as part of the first phase of the MTA and DOT's Select Bus Service (SBS) plan. The corridor was ultimately not included in the first phase of SBS routes. In February 2008, the MTA proposed an additional limited-stop service on the northern portion of the corridor between Flushing and Fordham Plaza, provisionally named the Q94. Eliminating the required transfer to the at East 180th Street, it was referred to as a \\"Super Limited\\", and would have also replaced the special school service (since discontinued) between Queens and Bedford Park. Though the Q94 was never implemented, the Q44 route was included in the SBS Phase II study in 2009. By 2013, the Q44 was the first route in Queens to have a full fleet of articulated buses; the same buses (the Nova Bus LFS model) used on SBS service. In 2014, the 164th Street corridor () and the Parsons/Kissena corridor ( and ) joined the Main Street corridor as potential SBS routes between Flushing and Jamaica. The Q25 Limited and Q44 Limited were selected for further studies, with the Q44 prioritized due to its high ridership, interborough connection between Queens and the Bronx, and the width of Main Street to facilitate bus lanes. As part of the conversion, several stops in the Bronx were eliminated; those retained constituted 85% of passenger usage in the borough. Several limited stops in the Jamaica business district were also eliminated. On November 29, 2015, the Q44 SBS began service, operating 24 hours a day. The Q20A became a full-time route to replace the discontinued late-night-only Q44 local route.  Incidents  The intersection of Main Street and Northern Boulevard as seen on September 26, 2017, eight days after a crash between a Q20A and a tour bus. The crash damaged the building on the left, which has scaffolding on it as a result of the collision. On September 18, 2017, during the morning rush hour, a private tour bus moving at a high speed collided with the back of a New Flyer Xcelsior XD40 Q20A bus turning from Main Street onto Northern Boulevard in Flushing. The bus then plowed into a Kennedy Fried Chicken restaurant at the corner of the intersection. The accident killed 3 people including the tour bus driver, and injured at least 17. The private charter bus company had been repeatedly cited for reckless driving. The charter driver was a former MTA bus driver, until he was fired in April 2015 after a crash in his personal automobile in which he pleaded guilty to driving under the influence and leaving the scene of the crash.

Through his work he formed a close friendship with General Douglas MacArthur. Films and legacy Courtenay had purchased a 16mm cinema camera and a large stock of colour film while in America. While a correspondent for the Sunday Times travelling with American forces through the Pacific, Courtenay took films of the events and locales he visited, including attacks on islands, the aftermath of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, and Emperor Hirohito's public addresses. After the war his films were shown to a wide variety of audiences including those in the British parliament and the White House.

The exact identity of the Ghassanid king who fought the battle is not certain, but he is commonly identified with al-Harith ibn Jabalah (), a major Byzantine client ruler who waged frequent conflicts with the Lakhmids under their respective king al-Mundhir III ibn al-Nu'man (). The Lakhmids in turn were clients of the Sassanid Persians, and the perennial tribal warfare between them and the Ghassanids was combined with the larger rivalry between Byzantium and Persia, with the Arabs fighting as auxiliaries for the two great empires. Yawm Halima is now commonly identified with a battle fought in June 554 near Chalcis (modern Qinnasrin), where the Ghassanids confronted one of Mundhir's raids. The Lakhmids were defeated and their king Mundhir fell on the field, but Harith also lost his eldest son Jabalah.

Express, Clare Campbell, Oct 31, 2013 Background Advice to animal owners In 1939 the British government formed the National Air Raid Precautions Animals Committee (NARPAC) to decide what to do with pets before war breaks out. The committee was worried that when the government would need to ration food, pet owners would decide to split their rations with their pets or leave their pets to starve. In response to that fear, NARPAC published a pamphlet titled \\"Advice to Animal Owners.\\" The pamphlet suggested moving pets from the big cities and into the countryside. It concluded with the statement that \\"If you cannot place them in the care of neighbours, it really is kindest to have them destroyed.\\"Bonzo's War: Animals Under Fire 1939 -1945 The pamphlet also contained an advertisement for a captive bolt pistol that could be used to humanely kill pets.

It is a high-level framework designed to provide an easy-to-use layer over the lower level APIs like OpenGL and Metal. SceneKit maintains an object based scene graph, along with a physics engine, particle system, and links to Core Animation and other frameworks to easily animate that display. SceneKit views can be mixed with other views, for instance, allowing a SpriteKit 2D display to be mapped onto the surface of an object in SceneKit, or a UIBezierPath from Core Graphics to define the geometry of a SceneKit object. SceneKit also supports import and export of 3D scenes using the COLLADA format. SceneKit was first released for macOS in 2012, and iOS in 2014. Basic concepts SceneKit maintains a scene graph based on a root object, an instance of the class SCNScene. The SCNScene object is roughly equivalent to the view objects found in most 2D libraries, and is intended to be embedded in a display container like a window or another view object. The only major content of the SCNScene is a link to the rootNode, which points to an SCNNode object. SCNNodes are the primary contents of the SceneKit hierarchy. Each Node has a Name, and pointers to optional Camera, Light and Geometry objects, as well as an array of childNodes and a pointer to its own parent. A typical scene will contain a single Scene object pointed to a conveniently named Node (often \\"root\\") whose primary purpose is to hold a collection of children Nodes. The children nodes can be used to represent cameras, lights, or the various geometry objects in the Scene. A simple Scene can be created by making a single SCNGeometry object, typically with one of the constructor classes like SCNBox, a single SCNCamera, one or more SCNLights, and then assigning all of these objects to separate Nodes. A single additional generic Node is then created and assigned to the SCNScene object's rootNode, and then all of the objects are added as children of that rootNode. SCNScenes also contain a number of built-in user interface controls and input/output libraries to greatly ease implementing simple viewers and similar tasks. For instance, setting the Scene's autoenablesDefaultLighting and allowsCameraControl to true, and then adding an object tree read from a COLLADA file will produce viewable content of arbitrary complexity with a few lines of code. The integration with Xcode allows the Scene itself to be placed in a window in Interface Builder, without any code at all. There is a Scenekit archive file format, using the filename extension .scn.

The report became an instant best-seller, and over two million Americans bought copies of the 426-page document. Its finding was that the riots resulted from black frustration at lack of economic opportunity.

Washington D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1968. The Commission concluded that a significant cause of urban violence was white racism and suggested that white America bore much of the responsibility for African American protests. The final report recommended expanded employment and education opportunity, more diverse and sensitive police forces, and substantial investments in new housing aimed at breaking up residential segregation. New initiatives needed to be “at a scale equal to the dimensions of the problems.” The Commission cautioned that only with “new will” in the nation could its recommendations be implemented.National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders.

Kerner Commission Executive Director Ginsburg, former Kerner Commissioner and Senator Fred Harris (D, OK) and former Kerner Commissioner and Senator Edward Brooke (R, MA) were among the Founding Trustees of the Eisenhower Foundation. The Foundation has released 25 year, 30 year and 40 year updates of the Kerner Commission's final report.  The 30 Year Update: Locked in the Poorhouse and The Millennium Breach.  In Locked in the Poorhouse, one of the two companion volume 30 year updates, Harris observed, “During most of the decade that followed the Kerner Report, America made progress on the principal formats that the report dealt with: race, poverty and inner cities. Then progress stopped and, in some ways, went into reverse. What caused this halt and retreat? First a series of economic shocks and trends had a depressing impact, especially on minorities. And second, the government's action and inaction bore a good deal of the blame...Today, thirty years after the Kerner report, there is more poverty in America, it is deeper, blacker and browner than before and it is more concentrated in the cities, which have become America's poorhouses.Harris, Fred R. and Lynn A.

What doesn't work is prison building, supply-side economics, policies like that. They've failed. We need to stop doing what doesn't work and invest in what does work: safe havens after school where kids come for help with their homework, as evaluated by Columbia University; the James Comer Yale University School Development Plan, where teachers and parents take over inner city schools; the Ford Foundation's Quantum Opportunities program that mentors high schoolers; community development corporations like the New Community Corporation in Newark, which creates jobs; the South Shore Bank, which creates banking for the inner city; and community-based policing by minority officers. Those are all proven, scientifically-evaluated programs, and if we replicate what works at a scale that's equal to the dimensions of the problem, we can make an impact.\\" Locked in the Poorhouse and The Millennium Breach also received coverage in the Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Newsweek and many regional newspapers – as well as on ABC, BBC, CNN and NPR.ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings. “Racial Divide,” March 2, 1998; NBC Nightly News with Jack Ford. “The Kerner Commission 30 Years Later,” March 1, 1998; CNN Network World News. “Kerner Commission Update,” March 1, 1998; National Public Radio: Locked in the Poorhouse Interview by Kojo Nnamdi with Fred Harris and Lynn Curtis, March 18, 1999; BBC Radio 5 Live.

The 40 year update viewed the 2008 election of the first African-American President as one of a number of indicators of post-Kerner program progress. But the update also reported that the child poverty rate and income inequality had increased since the 1968 Kerner report. With the failure of the No Child Left Behind Act, large disparities remained between the educational achievement of white high school students and Latino and African-American high school students. African- American unemployment continued to be roughly twice that of whites over the 40 years since the original Kerner report. The collaboration of the prison- industrial complex and racially-biased drug sentencing had dramatically increased incarceration rates, with African-American men aged 25 to 29 being almost 7 times as likely to be incarcerated as their white counterparts.Curtis, Alan and Fred R.

What Together We Can Do: A Forty Year Update of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders. Washington DC: 2008. • The nation's top strategic domestic priority should embrace win-win employment, economic, and education reforms that simultaneously benefit the anxious middle class, the neglected working class and the truly disadvantaged. • Demand side, Keynesian economic policy should lower unemployment; communicate to the poor, working class, and middle class that they need to band together; strengthen union organizing and link job training to job creation. • A new Employment Training and Job Creation Act should replace the outmoded and ineffective Workforce Investment Act and the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program. Trained and retrained American workers should be linked, as first priority, to jobs in sectors that need to be developed in the national interest –like health care, housing, school repair and construction, mass transit, energy and green technologies. • The failed No Child Left Behind Act should be replaced by an Education Equity Act. The federal government should begin to finance a system that creates equity in dollar investment per pupil across all school districts, as is done in most advanced industrialized countries. The Act should build on successful state equity models, like those in Connecticut and North Carolina. • Safe Haven Investment Neighborhoods should be funded across the nation. The Investment Neighborhoods should include people in deepest poverty, other impoverished citizens and working-class families. Drawing in part on the models like the Harlem Children's Zone, Safe Haven Investment Neighborhoods should replicate best practices – programs already proven to work. In each Safe Haven Investment Neighborhood, multiple and interdependent solutions should target multiple problems. • A new Safe Haven Investment Corporation should co-target federal with local public and private funding – channeling that funding in no small part to grassroots community-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations with demonstrated institutional capacity located in each Safe Haven Investment Neighborhood. • The tax breaks given to the wealthiest Americans in 2001 and 2003 should be reversed. This could save about $3.5 trillion over the next 10 years. Tax loopholes that give American one of the lowest effective corporate tax rates in the industrialized world should be eliminated. At the same time, we need to reduce taxes on the great majority of Americans. • To create national will, a new Fair Economic Deal movement should articulate a narrative that unites the middle class, the working class and the poor as partners in the American story. The movement should be based on the values of two Republican Presidents and two Democratic Presidents – Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy. Abraham Lincoln invested in public infrastructure and crusaded against racial injustice. Theodore Roosevelt called for regulation of corporate greed. Franklin Roosevelt created an American social contract. John Kennedy focused on “what together we can do” to serve our country. The PBS Bill Moyers Journal covered the 40 year Kerner Commission update. Moyers sent crews to cover the pre- report Foundation hearings in Detroit and Newark. After an in-depth interview with Harris and coverage of the Detroit and Newark hearings, Moyers observed:PBS Bill Moyers Journal. “Forty Years After the Kerner Commission,” March 28, 2008 We remember the Kerner Report for its searing conclusion that \\"our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white – separate and unequal.\\" African-Americans at the time were fast becoming concentrated and isolated in metropolitan ghettos, and the Kerner Commission said that by 1985, without new policies, our cities would have black majorities ringed with largely all-white suburbs. The commissioners acknowledged that government policies like urban-gentrification, and the construction of huge high-rise projects had helped to blight stable black communities. So they offered some specific and practical remedies – new jobs, affordable housing, and new steps to confront the destructive ghetto environment. But following the civil rights movement of the mid-sixties – the peaceful marches and demonstrations, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965– the riots triggered a mounting white backlash. LBJ's escalation of the war in Vietnam added fuel to the fires. The Kerner Report was published on March 1, 1968. Hardly five weeks later – on the fourth of April, forty years ago next week – Martin Luther King was assassinated. Flames again engulfed dozens of cities, and the possibility of large-scale change perished in the blood and ashes and racist toxins. The president had told the Kerner Commission: \\"Let your search be free…as best you can, find the truth and express it in your report.\\" They did. But the truth was not enough. The country lost the will for it. The Eisenhower Foundation's 40 year Kerner Riot Commission update also was the focus of an op-ed in the Washington Post by former Senator Brooke. A Republican, Brooke reviewed progress, but cautioned that “for America’s poor – those who do not know what health care is because for them it doesn’t exist, those for whom prison is a more likely prospect than college, those who have been abandoned to the worst of decaying, crime-ridden urban centers because of the flight of middle-class blacks, whites and Hispanics – the future may be as bleak as it was for their counterparts in the 1960s.”Brooke, Edward W. “King and Kerner: An Unfinished Agenda,” Washington Post, April 3, 2008. The 40 year update was extensively covered in other media, as well.Cose, Ellis. “It Was Always Headed Here,” Newsweek, March 31, 2008; Pilkington, Ed. “Katine: It Starts with a Village, Guardian, March 13, 2008; Bello, Marisol. “Programs for Urban Blacks Lauded,” USA Today, February 28, 2008; Nichols, Darren. “Kerner Commission: Not Enough Progress Made on Poverty: Detroit News, February 28, 2008; Pabst, Georgia. “Milwaukee Reflects Grim Statistics,” Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, February 29, 2008; Lerner, Richard. “Still Separate and Unequal 40 Years After Kerner,” Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, February 29, 2008.  Criticism  There were critics of the original Kerner Commission report, Locked in the Poorhouse and The Millennium Breach – and responses by the Eisenhower Foundation. For example, in a letter to the Wall Street Journal publication, Eisenhower Foundation Trustee Elliott Currie, Professor of Criminology, Law and Society at the University of California, Irvine, wrote:Currie, Elliott. “Inequality and Violence in Our Cities.” Wall Street Journal, March 23, 1998 Abigail and Stephan Thernstrom profess themselves mystified over the causes of urban violence analyzed – badly in their view – by the Kerner report of 1968 (“American Apartheid? Don’t Believe It.” Editorial Page, March 2). But their confusion requires an extraordinary level of denial, which can be maintained only by ignoring or misreading a body of evidence that was already substantial in the 1960s and is even larger today. To begin with, the Thernstroms, curiously, ignore altogether the role of the police in fueling the tensions that led to the worst of riots, though the Kerner report found anger at police practices at the top of the list of black residents’ grievances in the riot- torn cities. As importantly, the Thernstroms seem not to understand – or perhaps not to have read – the report's analysis of the links between social disadvantage and the outbreak of violence. They claim, for example, that black unemployment in Detroit, the city hardest hit by urban violence, was only 3.4 percent and hence the city could hardly be considered “a tinderbox ready to explode.” The authors of the Kerner report, however, knew better. They noted that the unemployment rate among black men in the 12th Street area, where the riot began, was estimated at 12 percent to 15 percent, and 30 percent or more for those under 25 – the population from which the typical riot participant came. More importantly, the Thernstroms are apparently unaware that the report cited Labor Department estimates that the proportion of inner-city blacks who were either out of work altogether (including those who had dropped out of the labor force), working part-time when they needed full-time work, or working at poverty-level wages, was many times higher than those officially jobless. They also noted that the most typical riot participant was drawn from the large populations of young men trapped in menial or low-paying jobs – and surrounded by an affluence they were largely blocked from attaining. An abundance of statistics shows that those conditions are still very much with us. The riots of the 60s constituted a staggering human tragedy. That tragedy will be compounded if we lose sight of the lessons they so painfully taught us about the connections between inequality and violence. Other critics argued in USA Today that, unlike the Kerner focus on blocked educational and economic opportunity and racism, the major problem among inner city African Americans was “single parent homes.” In response, Currie argued that the critics wrongly blamed the “heedless behavior of black men.” Currie pointed out that critics formerly had blamed the “welfare” system – but, by 2008, “welfare” had been ended for over 10 years. Returning to the findings of the Kerner Commission, Currie concluded that the real problems were:Currie, Elliott. “Economic, Social and Family Factors Craft Inner City Hurdles,” USA Today, March 6, 2008. Currie, Elliott, “40 Years After the Kerner Report,” Washington Times, March 13, 2008 • Jobless rates among black men that remained stratospheric even in times of economic growth; • The retreat from an already minimal commitment to investment in job creation and training; and • A stunning rise in incarceration of black men with no corresponding effort to reintegrate them on their release into productive roles in the community.

It was built on one of many vacant lots in Morrisania that resulted after some of the neighborhood's buildings were abandoned and demolished in the 1960s. The New York City Parks Department acquired this property in 1978 and it was briefly used as a community garden but later again became vacant. At the time, community organizer Megan Charlop led a protest effort against the movie Fort Apache, The Bronx arguing that it negatively depicted the neighborhood. As a compromise, the producers issued a $15,000 check to the fledgling Rock Greening Association, a community land trust Charlop had helped establish to acquire the empty lot where filming took place. The lot was then given to the city. In 1990, additional lots were acquired by Parks and the site was named Rocks and Roots Park. In 2011, a complete reconstruction of the park by Nancy Owens Studio preserved its naturalistic contours while including public gathering and sitting areas, handicapped-accessible walking paths and landscaped gardens. On November 7, 2011, the park was renamed for Estella Diggs in a ceremony attended by Diggs, local community leaders and a choir from Diggs’ church.Beekman, Daniel “New pocket park in Morrisania named for first Bronx African-American Assemblywoman Estella Diggs” New York Daily News 11/7/2011 In May 2012, the corner of Fulton Avenue nad East 167th Street facing the park was co-named Megan Charlop Way in honor of her efforts in transforming the undeveloped lot into a public space. In 2015, construction commenced on the lowland section of the park, expanding its lawns, paths and seating areas.http://www.nancyowensstudio.com/project_template.php?category=civic&id;=3&bgId;=02 The park reopened to the public on August 29, 2017.

He was killed during the siege of the Prussian fortress of Kolberg. Biography He was born in Milan, the son of Filippo and Teresa Crippa. His father, a state officer, was the last descendant of a medium-class family from Languedoc, and tried to make him a lawyer, with scarce results. = Early Service, 1796-1800 = In 1796, when the French with Napoleon Bonaparte entered Milan, he joined the National Guard of the Cisalpine Republic, as the second-in-command of Duke Gian Galeazzo Serbelloni. On 15 October he was moved to the Lombard Legion as head of battalion and aide-de-camp to the Mantuan general Giuseppe Lahoz Ortiz, and in this capacity served during the French invasion of the Papal State. At the Battle of Senio General Lahoz was wounded and he took command of the entire Legion, defeating the far more numerous Pontificians and capturing over one thousand prisoners, four banners and fourteen guns. He then conquered the fort of San Leo. In February 1799 he commanded the territorial division of Ferrara, and later served under General Garnier as his Chief of Staff, during the disastrous campaign against the Austro-Russian forces. Besieged with a handful of men in Castel Sant'Angelo, he surrendered only on the guarantee of military honours and a safeconduct, taking a ship that brought him in France. He then started to reorganise the troops of the collapsed Cisalpine Republic in the new Italian Legion, commanded by general Giuseppe Lechi, in which many officers and petty officers, due to the lack of recruits, served as simple soldiers. He distinguished himself during the Battle of Marengo, and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. In December 1800 the nicknamed \\"Teulié Brigade\\" was attached to the division of General Brune, who was ordered to attack in the Tirol to cut the Austrian communication lines. The short campaign was a complete success, and Brune later write on him: \\"We due every praise to the unshackable courage and capable direction of General Teulié\\". = The Italian Kingdom, 1800-1806 = He was nominated Minister of War of the Kingdom of Italy in April 1802, but left the position shortly after, possibly for his contrast with the Frenchmen that opposed his project of an independent Italian Army in an independent Italian state. In 1803 his brigade was part of the 2nd Italian Division of general Domenico Pino on The Channel, and, the following year, received the cross of the Legion d'Honneur by the Emperor himself. After a false accuse, he was subsequently removed and imprisoned, but Napoleon eventually restored him in his position and honours, giving him the rank of Division General and the command of the Pino's Division. He was awarded, in 1806, with the just instituted Order of the Iron Crown. = The War of the Fourth Coalition = After a brief service in the quarters of Boulogne, he distinguished himself leading his division in the War of the Fourth Coalition. He won the Prussian in Stargard and Neugarten, and was afterward placed as military governor of Prussia. The 24 February 1807 passed the Persante river and moved with a forced march on Kolberg. His commander, Marshal Berthier wrote of him: \\"Teulié with his men goes on a double pace; he has completely beaten the defenders of Kolberg and locked them into the fortress.\\" = Death at Kolberg = The 14 March 1807 he started the siege of Kolberg, under general Loison, who let him command all the siege operations. On the 12 June 1807, during a first line combat, a grenade killed two of his men and struck him in his leg. He died six days after for tetanus.  Legacy  His name was inscribed on the 17th column of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, one of the few Italian generals to have his name inscribed. According to his last will, his body was then buried in the Military Orphanage for Our Fallen's Children, in Milan, now the Italian Military School \\"Teulié\\", named after him.

Doors Open at 7pm. There is a warm-up session at about 7-30pm and the event starts dead on 8pm with the residents Crybb Folk. England, The club was opened by folk- comedian Dave Sampson on 19 February 1972. It soon outgrew its original venue at The Denbigh Arms, Monks Kirby so moved to the much larger room at The Fletch Hotel in Coventry where it successfully remained for some years. But even that venue with its 150 capacity was often sold out and on some occasions queues of over 150 people were waiting outside when the doors opened. This sort of popularity really pleased the brewery (Watneys) that they persuaded Sampson to open a Birmingham branch of The Wurzel Bush Folk Club at The Roebuck Ballroom at Erdington which had a capacity of over 400. The new venue was advertised by the brewery on Birmingham's new commercial radio station BRMB. The first night was packed out. With the Birmingham venue on a Friday night and the Coventry venue on the Saturday the club was often able to attract performers who normally only appeared in theatres. Jasper Carrott took advantage of this arrangement by recording his new album for DJM Records at both venues on consecutive nights. Giving an identical performance at both venues assisted editing. Jasper Carrott Rabbits On reached Number 5 in the album charts. Due to pressure of work after 3 years Sampson dropped the Birmingham club as he was working in Middlesbrough during the week. He continued with the club running on a Saturday night but because of a disagreement with a new management moved the folk club to the White Lion at Brinklow where it remained for the next 12 years. During those years meeting in the White Lions upstairs room, the club made international news after 6 ladies attended a performance by the Moulton Morris men when the took part in a fertility dance. Soon these ladies were pregnant. Central News sent the reporter John Swallow to report about the story for ITV. Sampson not only appeared on TV but on national radio and his song \\"In the club the traditional way\\" was played on a number of commercial radio news bulletins including Coventry's Mercia Sound. The News of the World told readers about this story on page 3 of their paper. In 1993 the folk club had to move from the White Lion after they turned the function room into bedrooms. For the next 15 years the club met at Brinklow Royal British Legion Club. The club held a reunion event in August 2016., Subsequently it restarted its weekly folk club events, again at the White Lion Inn in Brinklow, Warwickshire. In February 2017 the folk club moved to The Bulls Head In October 2018 the folk club moved to The Rugby West Indian Club. See the club's website www.wurzelbush.co.uk for the up to date programme.

The fraction that does pass through the filter is called dissolved organic matter (DOM). Particulate organic carbon (POC) is a closely related term often used interchangeably with POM. POC refers specifically to the mass of carbon in the particulate organic material, while POM refers to the total mass of the particulate organic matter. In addition to carbon, POM includes the mass of the other elements in the organic matter, such as nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. In this sense POC is a component of POM and there is typically about twice as much POM as POC.Moody, C.S. and Worrall, F. (2017) \\"Modeling rates of DOC degradation using DOM composition and hydroclimatic variables\\". Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences, 122(5): 1175–1191. . Many statements that can be made about POM apply equally to POC, and much of what is said in this article about POM could equally have been said of POC. Particulate organic matter is sometimes called macroorganic matter, or coarse fraction organic matter. Isolated by sieving or filtration, this fraction includes partially decomposed detritus and plant material, pollen, and other materials. When sieving to determine POM content, consistency is crucial because isolated size fractions will depend on the force of agitation. POM is readily decomposable, serving many soil functions and providing terrestrial material to water bodies. It is a source of food for both soil organisms and aquatic organisms and provides nutrients for plants. In water bodies, POM can contribute substantially to turbidity, limiting photic depth which can suppress primary productivity. POM also enhances soil structure leading to increased water infiltration, aeration and resistance to erosion Soil management practices, such as tillage and compost/manure application, alter the POM content of soil and water. OverviewTerrestrial ecosystems=Soil organic matter= Soil organic matter is anything in the soil of biological origin. Carbon is its key component comprising about 58% by weight. Simple assessment of total organic matter is obtained by measuring organic carbon in soil. Living organisms (including roots) contribute about 15% of the total organic matter in soil. These are critical to operation of the soil carbon cycle. What follows refers to the remaining 85% of the soil organic matter - the non-living component.Soil: Forms and Function Victorian Resources Online. Updated 23 March 2020. 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. As shown below, non-living organic matter in soils can be grouped into four distinct categories on the basis of size, behaviour and persistence.Baldock JA and Skjemstad JO (1999) \\"Soil organic carbon/soil organic matter in soil\\". In KI Peverill, LA Sparrow and DJ Reuter (Eds.) Soil analysis: an interpretation manual, pages 159–170, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Melbourne. These categories are arranged in order of decreasing ability to decompose. Each of them contribute to soil health in different ways. Dissolved organic matter (DOM): is the organic matter which dissolves in soil water. It comprises the relatively simple organic compounds (e.g. organic acids, sugars and amino acids) which easily decompose. It has a turnover time of less than 12 months. Exudates from plant roots (mucilages and gums) are included here. Particulate organic matter (POM): is the organic matter that retains evidence of its original cellular structure, and is discussed further in the next section. Humus: is usually the largest proportion of organic matter in soil, contributing 45 to 75%. Typically it adheres to soil minerals, and plays an important role structuring soil. Humus is the end product of soil organism activity, is chemically complex, and does not have recognisable characteristics of its origin. Humus is of very small unit size and has large surface area in relation to its weight. It holds nutrients, has high water holding capacity and significant cation exchange capacity, buffers pH change and can hold cations. Humus is quite slow to decompose and exists in soil for decades. Resistant organic matter: has a high carbon content and includes charcoal, charred plant materials, graphite and coal. Turnover times are long and estimated in hundreds of years. It is not biologically active but contributes positively to soil structural properties, including water holding capacity, cation exchange capacity and thermal properties. = Role of POM in soils = Particulate organic matter (POM) includes steadily decomposing plant litter and animal faeces, and the detritus from the activity of microorganisms. Most of it continually undergoes decomposition by microorganisms (when conditions are sufficiently moist) and usually has a turnover time of less than 10 years. Less active parts may take 15 to 100 years to turnover. Where it is still at the soil surface and relatively fresh, particulate organic matter intercepts the energy of raindrops and protects physical soil surfaces from damage. As it is decomposes, particulate organic matter provides much of the energy required by soil organisms as well as providing a steady release of nutrients into the soil environment. The decomposition of POM provides energy and nutrients. Nutrients not taken up by soil organisms may be available for plant uptake. The amount of nutrients released (mineralized) during decomposition depends on the biological and chemical characteristics of the POM, such as the C:N ratio. In addition to nutrient release, decomposers colonizing POM play a role in improving soil structure. Fungal mycelium entangle soil particles and release sticky, cement- like, polysaccharides into the soil; ultimately forming soil aggregates Soil POM content is affected by organic inputs and the activity of soil decomposers. The addition of organic materials, such as manure or crop residues, typically results in an increase in POM. Alternatively, repeated tillage or soil disturbance increases the rate of decomposition by exposing soil organisms to oxygen and organic substrates; ultimately, depleting POM. Reduction in POM content is observed when native grasslands are converted to agricultural land. Soil temperature and moisture also affect the rate of POM decomposition. Because POM is a readily available (labile) source of soil nutrients, is a contributor to soil structure, and is highly sensitive to soil management, it is frequently used as an indicator to measure soil quality. =Freshwater ecosystems= In poorly-managed soils, particularly on sloped ground, erosion and transport of soil sediment rich in POM can contaminate water bodies. Because POM provides a source of energy and nutrients, rapid build-up of organic matter in water can result in eutrophication. Suspended organic materials can also serve as a potential vector for the pollution of water with fecal bacteria, toxic metals or organic compounds. Marine ecosystems POC includes components of living cells as well as dead material (detritus), and originates from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources. The POC pool can also exchange material with the dissolved OC (DOC) pool through aggregation and disaggregation of particles. This process and others may be involved in the formation of the molecularly uncharacterized component (MUC), which may incorporate both autochthonous and allochthonous OC.Kharbush, J.J., Close, H.G., Van Mooy, B.A., Arnosti, C., Smittenberg, R.H., Le Moigne, F.A., Mollenhauer, G., Scholz-Böttcher, B., Obreht, I., Koch, B.P. and Becker, K.

In the simplified model, shown in the inset, the spheres represent either solid particles or aggregates. These particles (initial radius a0) produced within the sunlit euphotic zone (green region extending to zeu) sink at a rate predicted by Stokes law. They slow as they reach greater depths due to their shrinking volume and increasing water density and would entirely disappear at zdis.Omand, M.M., Govindarajan, R., He, J. and Mahadevan, A.

Life and particulate organic matter in the ocean have fundamentally shaped the planet. On the most basic level, particulate organic matter can be defined as both living and non-living matter of biological origin with a size of ≥0.2 μm in diameter, including anything from a small bacterium (0.2 μm in size) to blue whales (20 m in size).Blanchard, J.L., Heneghan, R.F., Everett, J.D., Trebilco, R. and Richardson, A.J.

(2015) \\"The ocean carbon sink–impacts, vulnerabilities and challenges\\". Earth System Dynamics, 6(1): 327–358. . Understanding the distribution, characteristics and dynamics of particulate matter in the ocean is hence fundamental in understanding and predicting the marine ecosystem, from food web dynamics to global biogeochemical cycles. =Measuring POM= Optical particle measurements are emerging as an important technique for understanding the ocean carbon cycle, including contributions to estimates of their downward flux, which sequesters carbon dioxide in the deep sea. Optical instruments can be used from ships or installed on autonomous platforms, delivering much greater spatial and temporal coverage of particles in the mesopelagic zone of the ocean than traditional techniques, such as sediment traps. Technologies to image particles have advanced greatly over the last two decades, but the quantitative translation of these immense datasets into biogeochemical properties remains a challenge. In particular, advances are needed to enable the optimal translation of imaged objects into carbon content and sinking velocities. In addition, different devices often measure different optical properties, leading to difficulties in comparing results.Giering, S.L., Cavan, E.L., Basedow, S.L., Briggs, N., Burd, A.B., Darroch, L.J., Guidi, L., Irrison, J.O., Iversen, M.H., Kiko, R. and Lindsay, D.J. (2020) \\"Sinking organic particles in the ocean—flux estimates from in situ optical devices\\". . 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. =Ocean primary production= Marine primary production can be divided into new production from allochthonous nutrient inputs to the euphotic zone, and regenerated production from nutrient recycling in the surface waters. The total new production in the ocean roughly equates to the sinking flux of particulate organic matter to the deep ocean, about 4 × 109 tons of carbon annually.Eppley, R.W. and Peterson, B.J. (1979) \\"Particulate organic matter flux and planktonic new production in the deep ocean\\". Nature, 282(5740): 677–680. . =Model of sinking oceanic particles= Sinking oceanic particles encompass a wide range of shape, porosity, ballast and other characteristics. The model shown in the diagram at the right attempts to capture some of the predominant features that influence the shape of the sinking flux profile (red line). The sinking of organic particles produced in the upper sunlit layers of the ocean forms an important limb of the oceanic biological pump, which impacts the sequestration of carbon and resupply of nutrients in the mesopelagic ocean. Particles raining out from the upper ocean undergo remineralization by bacteria colonized on their surface and interior, leading to an attenuation in the sinking flux of organic matter with depth. The diagram illustrates a mechanistic model for the depth- dependent, sinking, particulate mass flux constituted by a range of sinking, remineralizing particles. Marine snow varies in shape, size and character, ranging from individual cells to pellets and aggregates, most of which is rapidly colonized and consumed by heterotrophic bacteria, contributing to the attenuation of the sinking flux with depth. =Sinking velocity= The range of recorded sinking velocities of particles in the oceans spans from negative (particles float toward the surface) to several km per day (as with salp fecal pellets) When considering the sinking velocity of an individual particle, a first approximation can be obtained from Stoke's law (originally derived for spherical, non-porous particles and laminar flow) combined with White's approximation, which suggest that sinking velocity increases linearly with excess density (the difference from the water density) and the square of particle diameter (i.e., linearly with the particle area). Building on these expectations, many studies have tried to relate sinking velocity primarily to size, which has been shown to be a useful predictor for particles generated in controlled environments (e.g., roller tanks. However, strong relationships were only observed when all particles were generated using the same water/plankton community. When particles were made by different plankton communities, size alone was a bad predictor (e.g., Diercks and Asper, 1997) strongly supporting notions that particle densities and shapes vary widely depending on the source material. Packaging and porosity contribute appreciably to determining sinking velocities. On the one hand, adding ballasting materials, such as diatom frustules, to aggregates may lead to an increase in sinking velocities owing to the increase in excess density. On the other hand, the addition of ballasting mineral particles to marine particle populations frequently leads to smaller more densely packed aggregates that sink slower because of their smaller size. Mucous-rich particles have been shown to float despite relatively large sizes, whereas oil- or plastic- containing aggregates have been shown to sink rapidly despite the presence of substances with an excess density smaller than seawater.. In natural environments, particles are formed through different mechanisms, by different organisms, and under varying environmental conditions that affect aggregation (e.g., salinity, pH, minerals), ballasting (e.g., dust deposition, sediment load; van der Jagt et al., 2018) and sinking behaviour (e.g., viscosity;). A universal conversion of size-to-sinking velocity is hence impracticable. = Role in the lower aquatic food web = Along with dissolved organic matter, POM drives the lower aquatic food web by providing energy in the form of carbohydrates, sugars, and other polymers that can be degraded. POM in water bodies is derived from terrestrial inputs (e.g. soil organic matter, leaf litterfall), submerged or floating aquatic vegetation, or autochthonous production of algae (living or detrital). Each source of POM has its own chemical composition that affects its lability, or accessibility to the food web. Algal-derived POM is thought to be most labile, but there is growing evidence that terrestrially-derived POM can supplement the diets of micro- organisms such as zooplankton when primary productivity is limited. =The biological carbon pump= The dynamics of the particulate organic carbon (POC) pool in the ocean are central to the marine carbon cycle. POC is the link between surface primary production, the deep ocean, and sediments. The rate at which POC is degraded in the dark ocean can impact atmospheric CO2 concentration. Therefore, a central focus of marine organic geochemistry studies is to improve the understanding of POC distribution, composition, and cycling. The last few decades have seen improvements in analytical techniques that have greatly expanded what can be measured, both in terms of organic compound structural diversity and isotopic composition, and complementary molecular omics studies. As illustrated in the diagram, phytoplankton fix carbon dioxide in the euphotic zone using solar energy and produce POC. POC formed in the euphotic zone is processed by marine microorganisms (microbes), zooplankton and their consumers into organic aggregates (marine snow), which is then exported to the mesopelagic (200–1000 m depth) and bathypelagic zones by sinking and vertical migration by zooplankton and fish.Basu, S. and Mackey, K.R.

In brief, photosynthesis by microorganisms in the upper tens of meters of the water column fix inorganic carbon (any of the chemical species of dissolved carbon dioxide) into biomass.

The biological carbon pump is hence of similar magnitude to current carbon emissions from fossil fuels (~10 Gt C year−1). Any changes in its magnitude caused by a warming world may have direct implications for both deep-sea organisms and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.Kwon, E.Y., Primeau, F. and Sarmiento, J.L.

Marine Ecology Progress Series, 470: 249–271. . The magnitude and efficiency (amount of carbon sequestered relative to primary production) of the biological carbon pump, hence ocean carbon storage, is partly determined by the amount of organic matter exported and the rate at which it is remineralized (i.e., the rate with which sinking organic matter is reworked and respired in the mesopelagic zone region.Iversen, M. and Ploug, H.

Marine Ecology Progress Series, 283: 55–71. . Sinking particles can be phytoplankton, zooplankton, detritus, fecal pellets, or a mix of these (Simon et al., 2002; Turner, 2002, 2015). They range in size from a few micrometers to several centimeters, with particles of a diameter of >0.5 mm being referred to as “marine snow” (Alldredge and Silver, 1988). In general, particles in a fluid are thought to sink once their densities are higher than the ambient fluid, i.e., when excess densities are larger than zero. Larger individual phytoplankton cells can thus contribute to sedimentary fluxes. For example, large diatom cells and diatom chains with a diameter of >5 μm have been shown to sink at rates up to several 10 s meters per day, though this is only possible owing to the heavy ballast of a silica frustule (Waite et al., 1997a; Miklasz and Denny, 2010). Both size and density affect particle sinking velocity; for example, for sinking velocities that follow Stokes' Law, doubling the size of the particle increases the sinking speed by a factor of 4 (Moore and Villareal, 1996; Waite et al., 1997a). However, the highly porous nature of many marine particles means that they do not obey Stokes' Law because small changes in particle density (i.e., compactness) can have a large impact on their sinking velocities. Large sinking particles are typically of two types: (1) aggregates formed from a number of primary particles, including phytoplankton, bacteria, fecal pellets, live protozoa and zooplankton and debris, and (2) zooplankton fecal pellets, which can dominate particle flux events and sink at velocities exceeding 1,000 m d−1. Knowing the size, abundance, structure and composition (e.g. carbon content) of settling particles is important as these characteristics impose fundamental constraints on the biogeochemical cycling of carbon. For example, changes in climate are expected to facilitate a shift in species composition in a manner that alters the elemental composition of particulate matter, cell size and the trajectory of carbon through the food web, influencing the proportion of biomass exported to depth (Finkel et al., 2010). As such, any climate-induced change in the structure or function of phytoplankton communities is likely to alter the efficiency of the biological carbon pump, with feedbacks on the rate of climate change (Matear and Hirst, 1999; Le Quéré et al., 2007).

History The establishment was first opened in 1838 by Susan Fawcett as \\"a whorehouse,\\" according to Cincinnati historian Mike Morgan. In 1861, new owner Simon Arnold operated it as a bar and lived upstairs. The Arnold family operated the bar through 98 years and three generations until 1959, when Elmer Arnold sold it to former professional wrestler and mob collector Jim Christakos, who also lived upstairs. In 1976, Cincinnati City Council member Jim Tarbell purchased it from Christakos and also moved in upstairs. He expanded the bar to include a large outdoor courtyard. In 1998 longtime Arnold's server Ronda Breeden bought it to run with her son Chris Breeden. In 2019 Chris and Bethany Breeden took over ownership. During prohibition the bar operated as a speakeasy. Some believe the building to be haunted. The bathtub cart which fronts the building and is used in local parades refers to the second-floor bathtub which is reputed to have been used to make bathtub gin during prohibition. In 2019 Arnold's partnered with local distillers Woodstone Creek to produce Hugo Arnold's Bathtub Gin, named for the prohibition-era owner of the bar. Reception One of America's oldest bars, Arnold's Bar and Grill has been noted in Esquire magazine's \\"Best Bars in America\\", Thrillist's \\"Most Iconic Bar in Ohio\\", The Daily Meal's \\"150 Best bars in America\\" and Serious Eats' \\"The Cincinnati 10\\". Esquire's beverage historian David Wondrich stated that \\"if Arnold's were in New York, San Francisco, Chicago, or Boston – somewhere, in short, that people actually visit – it would be world-famous.\\" Street art In 2010 Shepard Fairey installed a 15-foot-tall by 20-foot-wide mural entitled \\"Global Warning\\" on Arnold's exterior wall. Fairey installed the mural as part of his show \\"Supply and Demand\\" at the Contemporary Arts Center that year. The mural is made from wheatpasted screen prints, which the bar has maintained. In 2013 street artist JR installed a wheatpaste mural in Arnold's courtyard. The mural depicts Arnold's waitresses from the 1930s. JR installed the piece as part of his \\"Unframed\\" series, an ongoing project that began in 2010 using images by famous or anonymous photographers and archival images taken out of their context. JR has exhibited Unframed works in Cincinnati, Marseille, Atlanta, Washington DC, Baden Baden, Grottaglie, Vevey, and São Paulo. In 2015 the artist Hargo (also known as Cash For Your Warhol) installed a mural on Arnold's exterior alley wall. Hargo installed the mural as part of his show \\"Cash For Your Warhol: Fund Your Startup!\\" being held at The BLDG in Covington, Kentucky. In 2020 street artist Vhils installed a carved bas-relief mural portraying \\"Peanut Jim\\" Shelton in the courtyard. In popular culture=On television= In a 2018 episode of the Travel Channel's Man v. Food, host Casey Webb visits Arnold's during the episode's trip to Cincinnati. Arnold's was featured on Season 3 Episode 1 of First We Feast's Hot Ones with host Sean Evans and guest Padma Lakshmi from Top Chef. Producers for the NBC drama Harry's Law liked Arnold's so much that they decided to include it as part of the show. They built a replica set of Arnold's as a hangout for the characters on the show. Even borrowing actual staff uniforms, table tents and copies of artwork to be used on the show. When the show was ultimately canceled, they sent actual set pieces to Arnold's which are displayed on the second floor of the bar. Arnold's Bar and Grill's executive Chef, Kayla Robison appeared on Food Network's Guy's Grocery Games on October 9, 2019. Kayla was a contestant in the episode and beat out three other chefs to win the competition. The winning chef is usually sent on a \\"shopping spree\\" where Fieri gives them five clues and they have to race against the clock to find five food items the clues corresponded. If they get the clues right, they win $20,000. Things went a little differently on Robison's episode. Robison, a single mother to 9-year-old daughter Dre, was asked what she'd like to tell her daughter after winning. Robison had talked with Dre before filming began, and Dre had one request: She wanted to talk to Guy Fieri. So Fieri called up Dre and put her on speakerphone in the studio. Robinson is quoted as saying \\"Everyone in the studio is crying, I'm a sobbing mess, and Fieri asks her daughter, 'How do you think your mom did?'\\" \\"Dre said, 'I think she did really good and awesome and I'm proud of her.\\" Fieri said that after talking with Robison and Dre and hearing their story, he decided to forgo the challenge and give her the $20,000 without making her do the final competition. On November 27, 2019 Chef Kayla Robison also represented Arnold's on NBC's Today (American TV program) for a Thanksgiving themed segment entitled The United Plates of Thanksgiving. To celebrate Thanksgiving, The Today Show brought together 52 chefs from across the country to celebrate all the flavors of America with 52 dishes representing each of the states (plus Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico). =In film= The 2015 film Carol, directed by Todd Haynes and nominated for 6 Academy Awards, was partially filmed at Arnold's. Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Sarah Paulson and Jake Lacy were featured in scenes filmed at Arnold's. The 2016 film Mauraders, directed by Steven C.

She made her feature film directorial debut with Cuties in 2020 and became a popular and controversial figure globally after the film's international release on Netflix. On 8 March 2019 coinciding with the International Women's Day, she received the Academy Gold Fellowship for Women from the Academy Women's Initiative. Career Doucouré was born and raised in Paris to parents of Senegalese origin and graduated with a licence in biology from Pierre and Marie Curie University. She created and released her first self- made short film, Hide-and-seek, in 2013. =Maman(s)= In 2015, she produced her second short film, Maman(s), with the assistance of studio Bien ou Bien Productions and producer Zangro. The short film was critically acclaimed for its screenplay and was premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, 2016 Sundance Film Festival and also jointly won the César Award for Best Short Film at the 42nd César Awards in 2017 along with Towards Tenderness directed by Alice Diop. During the 2017 Cesar Award ceremony, she reflected her painful experiences of being a black, Muslim female director while working in a white male dominated film industry. =Cuties= She penned the script for her debut feature film Cuties in early 2017 taking her life experience as a refugee girl into account. The script eventually won the Sundance's Global Filmmaking Award in 2017. The film is based on a traditional Senegalese Muslim girl who is caught and torn between two contrasting fortunes, traditional values and internet culture while also speaking about hypersexualization of preadolescent girls. It premiered in the World Cinema Dramatic Competition sector of 2020 Sundance Film Festival on 23 January 2020 and won the Directing Jury Award praising the script of the film. The film was not deemed controversial when it was premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Doucouré said she \\"created a climate of trust between the children and myself\\" during filming. She stated while working on the film, \\"I explained to them everything I was doing and the research that I had done before I wrote this story. I was also lucky that these girls' parents were also activists, so we were all on the same side. At their age, they've seen this kind of dance. Any child with a telephone can find these images on social media these days.\\" She also stated that she worked with a child psychologist during filming. It was revealed that Doucouré spent nearly 18 months researching studies how young and pre-teen children are being exposed to 18+ adult content and sexualised images on social media in order to showcase the accurate reality in the film. She revealed that approximately 700 girls were auditioned to choose the suitable girl to play the lead role. Despite being critically acclaimed, the film became the subject of public controversy with the release of a promotional poster by Netflix. The social media outrage culminated in a petition claiming it \\"sexualizes an 11-year-old for the viewing pleasure of paedophiles\\" attracting 25,000 signatures in less than 24 hours. Doucouré was also targeted directly, receiving multiple death threats, even though the director and Netflix both stated that she had never seen the promotional poster in question, and that any promotion of child sexualization is neither intended nor an accurate representation of the movie. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos apologised to Doucouré and the company removed the poster from the platform. In September 2020, in an interview hosted by French organisation UniFrance she reflected that the film became controversial primarily due to Netflix' selection of artwork. She insisted that she also shares the same spirit and fight against sexualisation of children similar to those who have been criticising the film.

Markey's work combines elements of cabaret theater and comedy and often incorporates stories of their childhood in the Midwest. The New York Times has described Markey as having \\"a cult following as an alt-cabaret star with swaggering confidence and off-kilter sense of humor.\\" Biography Markey was born in Michigan in 1981. They were raised Catholic. Their father was a marketer in telecommunications and their mother was a medical assistant. In high school, Markey flirted with being a \\"Bible Belt Christian,\\" due to the influence of friends and their sense that \\" it felt like really impassioned, relatively speaking, to Catholicism.\\" In high school, Markey informed their parents that they wanted to become a performer, rather than a veterinarian, which made their mother \\"really mad.\\" Markey studied performance in college at the University of Michigan, taking a class taught by well-known performance artist Holly Hughes. After college, Markey worked for five months at a strip club, an experience that, according to a New York Times profile, was \\"helpful in developing her [sic] confidence and stage presence.\\" Markey drew upon this experience in several performance works. Markey has described, in an interview published in Bomb, their self-imposed separation from their family after they came out as gay, a period they described as a \\"wonderful break of me being able to just develop artistically outside the bounds of me feeling as accountable to them.\\" In the same interview, Markey described their misgivings and anxieties about their family seeing their work, which draws upon their family life. Markey explained: \\"It’s not exactly dirty laundry, but just things that feel private are like, being made into a show where tons of people are watching it.\\" Live Performance Work In 2010, Markey's show \\"Puppy Love: A Stripper's Tail\\" was produced at Performance Space 122 in New York City. Based on Markey's experiences working as a stripper after college, \\"Puppy Love\\" was praised as \\"a must-see tale/tail for all you ladies and gents (but mostly ladies) who work in the gray area between theater and erotic arts in New York. It’s also worth seeing if you don’t work in that lovely, glistening niche of the alternative entertainment world.\\" Michelle Tea praised \\"Puppy Love,\\" calling it > a sex work narrative, but in the form of a musical. The problem with most > sex work narratives is that they are not musicals ... they don’t innovate on > a story that we’ve now heard a lot, a story that doesn’t really change up > all that much. But Erin brings into it her [sic] voices, her [sic] singular > artistic voice of course, but also her [sic] singing voice which is really > good. Like, she [sic] could go on American Idol or something. In 2013, Markey starred in Progressive Theatre Workshop's \\"God Hates This Show: Shirley Phelps-Roper in Concert, Live From Hell,\\" a musical written and directed by John J. Caswell, Jr. satirizing Westboro Baptist Church. Markey played Shirley Phelps-Roper, daughter of Fred Phelps, the founder of Westboro Baptist Church. In the play, Phelps-Roper has died and gone to hell, and sings songs expressing the hateful beliefs of the church. As one account described their performance, \\"[b]acked by a full rock band, Markey as Phelps-Roper sing such 'hits' as 'Death in Your Window,' a parody of Melissa Etheridge’s 'Come to My Window,' and 'Stinky Freak,' known in non-helllish circles as 'Super Freak.' She’s [sic] accompanied by a trio of backup singers and dancers in full-on cabaret mode.\\" In 2013-14, Markey's show \\"Erin Markey\\" ran at Joe's Pub. Jarrett Earnest, writing about the show, observed that > Erin Markey’s energy, her [sic] sensibility, is so singularly constructed > for herself [sic] that it couldn’t be transferred to another person, maybe > that is one thing people mean in calling her [sic] a performance artist. She > [sic] plays \\"Erin Markey\\" as an outsized persona through autobiographical > sketches interlaced with musical numbers—a tried and true nightclub > strategy. The songs, usually contemporary pop songs, are performed with an > intensity that unravels them. Asked about their work in \\"Erin Markey,\\" Markey explained: > It’s funny to be making this show right now where I’m supposed to be Erin > Markey the whole time because I feel like I work best when I’m in character. > That’s when I’m most honest. So that’s not difficult for me to go back and > forth between characters either, because you know different situations call > for different folks. Not that that’s made so explicit in my life, in my > practical life I mean. I do think we’re going through this time where > identity is not as … people aren’t as interested in being one singular thing > anymore. I just had trouble writing a bio recently because I was like, \\"I > don’t want to be called a performance artist. I don’t wanna be called a > comedian, I don’t want to be called an actor, or a singer or a cabaret > artist,\\" because none of those things seem to really describe who I am. In 2015, Markey's play \\"Deleted Scenes from Fun Home,\\" based on the Broadway adaptation Alison Bechdel's graphic novel Fun Home, was produced at the Duplex Cabaret Theatre in New York City. A one-person show written by and starring Markey, the show purported to present deleted scenes from the Broadway musical Fun Home. Asked about the inspiration for \\"Deleted Scenes from Fun Home,\\" Markey described how they became obsessed with the score to the Broadway musical Fun Home, saying that \\"for largely unnameable or unknowable reasons, I was activated in a strange way that I had no control over.\\" Markey went on to explain the appeal that the Broadway musical Fun Home had for them: > The fact that I was having this sensation was a huge revelation to me—or > really, a prior absence of these feelings was the revelation. The fact that > the story of a butch lesbian was being supported on a Broadway budget level > was a huge part of it. The money. Or maybe it was the fact that Alison as a > character and as a woman was not operating in the traditional economies of > desire and that there was a huge budget for that. Or maybe it was the very > particular sound of conservatory-trained voices (and all the gender/access > stuff that sound comes with) singing some actual thoughts I’ve had in the > context of a Broadway musical, which is a pretty standardized form (though > Fun Home took some major liberties) that I generally don’t feel compelled to > deeply emotionally connect to as an artist, or so I thought. On January 13, 2016, Markey's show \\"A Ride on the Irish Cream,\\" which was funded in part by an Indiegogo campaign, premiered at the Abrons Arts Center of the Henry Street Settlement. The show has been described as > a musical anchored inside the memory of a Michigan backyard on the bank of > the Kawkawlin River. A live band and original score become the space for the > thrills and terrors of a relationship between Reagan (Markey), a > vainglorious self-made girl, and Irish Cream (Becca Blackwell), her family's > pontoon boat/horse. They are in love, but when their relationship is tested > by dust ruffles, sex for money, severe T-storms, and a secret cellar, the > only way to stay together is to remember all the parts of themselves their > bodies tried to forget. Markey has stated that they consider alt-cabaret performer Bridget Everett a \\"possible career model\\" for her. Describing their troubles writing an accurate description of their career, Markey said that the \\"most truthful\\" description of what they do is \\"Erin Markey makes stuff for stage and video that has music in it.\\" Television Work Markey has appeared in the Season 3 of the HBO series High Maintenance, playing the character Cori. The Atlantic described their performance as a \\"lived-in depiction of blue-collar crunchiness.\\" ReferencesAdditional sources   External links * Erin Markey's website * Erin Markey's Youtube channel * Erin Markey's Twitter * I Deserve This, a blog by Erin Markey and Lorelei Lee Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:American performance artists Category:Performance art in New York City Category:University of Michigan alumni Category:21st-century American artists Category:21st-century women artists Category:People from Brooklyn ","title":"Erin Markey"},{"id":"49091169","text":"The South Fork Wenaha River is a tributary of the Wenaha River in the U.S. state of Oregon. The river begins in the Blue Mountains south of Bone Spring in Wallowa County near its border with Union County. From there it flows generally northeast through the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness of the Umatilla National Forest to meet the North Fork Wenaha River. The combined forks form the main stem Wenaha, a tributary of the Grande Ronde River. Named tributaries of the South Fork Wenaha from source to mouth are Milk and Trapper creeks followed by Cougar Canyon. Then come Jaussard and Elk creeks. Recreation The main path along the South Fork is the Wenaha River Trail, a route with trailheads at Troy and Timothy Springs. It runs parallel to the main stem between Troy and Wenaha Forks and roughly parallel to the South Fork upstream of the confluence. This trail connects to other wilderness paths: Elk Flat, Hoodoo, and Cross Canyon trails. The trail system is used by hikers, backpackers, and horse riders. It offers panoramic views, access to fishing, and suitable spots for dispersed camping. It is also remote, involves significant elevation changes, can be extremely hot in summer, and is frequented by rattlesnakes.

Life Of Greek origin, Badr was originally a slave of the founder of the Tulunid regime, Ahmad ibn Tulun, who later set him free. In September 893, along with Muhammad ibn Abba, and the governor of Tarsus, Ahmad ibn Tughan al- Ujayfi, Badr led an expedition against the Byzantine Empire, reaching as far as al-Balaqsun (unidentified, possibly Carian or Lycian Telmessos). Following the death of Ibn Tulun's son Khumarawayh in 896, many Tulunid officers left Egypt and defected to the Abbasids. Badr remained behind, and ranked, along with Faik and Safi, as one of the principal commanders; each of them commanding a portion of the army, they were able to force the Tulunid government to hand over the revenue necessary to continue paying their troops, whose total loyalty they thus secured. Consequently, they, and Badr in particular, were among the main rivals of Muhammad ibn Abba, who acted as the regent of the underage emir Harun ibn Khumarawayh. In 902, he led a relief army from Egypt to confront the Qarmatians under Yahya ibn Zikrawayh (the \\"Master of the She-camel\\"), who had attacked Syria in 902 and besieged Tughj ibn Juff in Damascus. The two Tulunid commanders fought with the Qarmatians before the gates of the city and managed to kill the Qarmatian leader, but nevertheless lost the battle. Yahya was succeeded by his brother, Husayn (the \\"Man with the Mole\\"), who proceeded to lay waste to much of Syria in 902–903. Sometime before late August 903, however, he scored a big victory against the Qarmatians, killing many and driving the rest into the desert. This event is only known from a dispatch sent to Baghdad, briefly mentioned by al-Tabari. This success was soon followed by the decisive victory of the Abbasid army at the Battle of Hama in November, which led to the capture and execution of Husayn and the senior Qarmatian leaders. In autumn 904, the Abbasids under Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib launched a campaign to recover Egypt and end the Tulunid regime. When Muhammad arrived at the borders of Egypt in November, Badr went over to him. The defection of the most senior commander was soon followed by other Tulunid officers, and when Harun ibn Khumarawayh was murdered by one of his own men, the regime collapsed into anarchy, and Muhammad entered Fustat without opposition. Now in Abbasid service, in August 905 Badr received robes of honour from Caliph al-Muktafi, and was sent as deputy and advisor to another commander, Fatik, to confront the rebellion of a former Tulunid officer, Ibrahim al-Khaliji, who had seized much of the country along with Fustat. In 914, he was governor of Fars. Following the assassination of the Samanid ruler Ahmad ibn Isma'il and the accession of his underage son, the Samanid regime was weakened. Badr used the opportunity to re-assert Abbasid control over Sistan, sending Fadl ibn Hamid there as his deputy. This success was short-lived, however, and the province soon fell back into the hands of local warlords, until the emergence of Kathir ibn Ahmad as its ruler in 917. In October 917, Badr was placed in command of 5,000 men and sent to pursue the rebel leader Abdalla ibn Ibrahim al-Misma'i and his Kurdish followers near Isbahan. Badr died in 923.

Should the league establish a team in London, it would become the first of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada to establish a franchise outside either of those two countries. A London NFL franchise would be intended to grow the league's revenues and provide further access to the British and European markets. However, the agreement of league owners is needed to undertake an expansion or relocation, and a London franchise would face financial, legal and logistical challenges. Possible home stadiums for the London team include one or more of Wembley Stadium, Twickenham Stadium or Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The NFL is aiming to establish a London franchise by around 2025, and has the active support of the British government. Since 2007, the league has held multiple regular season games in London each season as part of NFL London Games, allowing the league to test solutions to some of the challenges facing a hypothetical London franchise. Background Although American football in the United Kingdom has historically been a niche sport, British interest in the NFL peaked in the 1980s, in which time London hosted some pre-season games; during the 1990s, the city hosted the London Monarchs in the league's developmental Europe League. However, as all NFL Europe franchises outside Germany and the Netherlands, the Monarchs were ultimately relocated due to lack of public interest. Popular interest waned with the growth of the Premier League in the 1990s, although it grew again from 2007 following the establishment of the International Series. It also led to steady increases in actual participation in amateur games. Mechanics An affirmative vote of three-quarters of the owners of the NFL's 32 clubs is required before a new team can be created (known as expansion) or before an existing team is allowed to move to a new market (known as relocation), i.e. 24 or more clubs would have to approve of the decision. According to The Guardian, as of 2015 it was \\"well-known\\" that a London franchise was a goal of the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, although \\"he tends to avoid specifics on the process to make that happen\\". The NFL's Executive Vice President International Mark Waller is more specific, expressing the goal as \\"to build a fanbase that would be able to support a franchise\\". According to Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank speaking in 2014, \\"The approach that the international committee and the commissioner have taken is, \\"Let's do London right, and then move from there to potentially somewhere else\\".\\" =Expansion franchise= In the opinion of former NFL executive Jim Bailey, the NFL would probably prefer to create a London-based franchise through the expansion route, since that would offer them more control over the process. According to CBS however, as of 2012 the club owners were generally satisfied with the league's 32 team model, and would prefer a relocation. According to the Associated Press, the 32 team model is seen as advantageous as it offers \\"competitively balanced schedules and division alignments\\". CBS also argued that expansion teams generally struggle \\"for quite some time\\", suggesting a relocated team would be the better option from the standpoint of competitiveness. Speaking in 2012, Goodell responded positively to the prospect of creating new teams through expansion \\"in the foreseeable future\\". It has been speculated that the current (2012) US market was saturated, and so it was unlikely that an expansion team within the US would generate the NFL's desired growth without a fundamental change in their funding model, such as the introduction of pay-per-view TV, which was also seen as unlikely since the league's current broadcasting contracts run to 2022. =Shared franchise= According to NFL.com, one possible way to achieve a London franchise in a way that overcomes the various issues facing a London operation, which has been considered by team owners and NFL executives, is the possibility of a shared franchise, with the team playing four home games in London and four in the US, although this was not considered ideal as it could potentially weaken the appeal given the split fanbase and ultimately not achieve critical mass, in addition it would be unlikely to be attractive to London fans if it were assumed in that scenario that any such team would always play its post-season games in its US base. Speaking in 2015, Waller stated \\"we've never had real discussions about a shared market\\". =Relocating a franchise=Jacksonville Jaguars As the designated home team for the International Series, the Jacksonville Jaguars are often mentioned as the most likely existing NFL team to relocate to London, leaving their current home of TIAA Bank Field in Florida. It is often pointed out in support that current Jaguars owner Shahid Khan is himself based in London, and also owns Fulham F.C. While Khan admits the move has been a success in terms of improving the finances and profile of what was a small and struggling franchise, he has nonetheless been reluctant to commit to a move, preferring the current arrangement. On March 27, 2017, it was reported by City A.M. that the Jaguars are in discussion to build a permanent training facility near Wembley Stadium. If done, the team would be the first NFL franchise to have a training facility built outside of the U.S. On April 26, 2018 it was reported that Khan had made an offer to the FA to buy Wembley Stadium,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/26/fa-sell-wembley- fulham-owner-shahid-khan although he subsequently rescinded that offer. Franchises with market knowledge As well as the Jacksonville Jaguars, the fact that some other existing franchises have owners with knowledge of the British market due to also owning United Kingdom based sports teams, such as the Glazer family's ownership of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers based in Tampa, Florida and Manchester United leads to them being suggested as potential relocation candidates. Up until their move to Los Angeles was announced in January 2016, this also included the former St. Louis Rams owned by Arsenal F.C.'s majority shareholder, Stan Kroenke. Franchises with short leases The fact that the Jacksonville Jaguars have a short term lease on its stadium is also often used to support media speculation that the franchise may be the one to relocate to London. This was also the case for the former St. Louis Rams and San Diego Chargers until their respective moves to Los Angeles in 2016 and 2017 (even so, although the Rams will own their stadium and are almost certain to stay in Los Angeles for the long-term, the Chargers will be leasing a stadium and have not yet established a fan base, leaving open the possibility for another relocation),Chargers, NFL reportedly considering relocating franchise to London on permanent basis amid L.A. failures by Will Brinson from CBS Sports, November 5, 2019 and the former Oakland Raiders until relocation to Las Vegas was approved in 2017. The most immediate likely candidate for relocation is the Carolina Panthers. The cost to terminate the Panthers' agreement to use Bank of America Stadium after the 2018 season is relatively small, and the team's incoming owner, David Tepper, does not have any significant ties to the Carolinas and has been tepid in his support of keeping the team in the region, stating upon assuming ownership in July 2018 \\"Charlotte is a logical place (... but) you're asking me too much. The only thing I have a market on right now is a lack of knowledge. I'll call it stupidity.\\" Like the Raiders, the timing of the team's sale and stadium agreement is less than ideal, since the league does not intend to put a team in London on such short notice. The Raiders, lacking a stadium for 2019, were said to have an \\"extreme long shot\\" at playing all of their home games in London that year, should all other options fail. Cost and logistics concerns made this scenario unlikely, and the Raiders ultimately decided to renew their agreement with the Oakland Coliseum after initially stating they would not do so.Raiders most likely to play in Bay Area in 2019 at the stadium of either 49ers or Giants. CBS Sports. Retrieved January 12, 2019. Weaker franchises As happened with the Buffalo Bills in 2014, even franchises with relatively long lease agreements but which are otherwise seen as struggling in their own market, are often named by the media as potential candidates for relocation to London, on the basis that those advocating relocation to a more lucrative market would be offering more money than those proposing to stay put. In the specific case of the Bills, it was however suggested that the NFL would oppose relocation since they were the only NFL team which played in New York state (the New York Jets and New York Giants being located in a shared stadium in New Jersey), and until the team returned to respectability under head coach Sean McDermott, its persistent mediocrity would make it an unattractive relocation candidate. The Bills' lease has an exit window in the 2020 offseason (which it opted not to exercise) and expires after the 2022 season, coincidentally the end of the NFL's current TV contracts. Countering one reason often cited as why the Jaguars would move, their low attendances, it has been argued that there are other franchises such as the Buccaneers with even lower attendances and less potential for growth in their own market in comparison. =Multiple franchises= Given the size of London, it has even been suggested by Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank that there could ultimately be more than one franchise located in London, although not before a team in another European country. Potential stadiums One potential advantage for London as a market for an NFL franchise is that all of the likely stadiums for the franchise have already been built, with two of them being built in the 21st century and having sufficient modern amenities to host such a team. This eliminates the expense, currently over one billion United States dollars, of constructing a stadium for the team that meets NFL specifications. =Wembley Stadium= Wembley Stadium, England's national association football stadium, was rebuilt and re-opened in 2007, and was the first venue for International Series games in that same year. It was built with locker rooms which are twice the size usually found in soccer venues, which allows them to accommodate a 53-man NFL roster. Wembley is expected to remain the exclusive venue until at least the second game of the 2016 programme (October 23). The stadium's owners, the Football Association, are reportedly interested in using Wembley as the base of a London team, but it has been suggested by The Telegraph that they may struggle to accommodate a full programme of NFL games, as well as hosting the England national football team. Another potential issue is the natural grass pitch (following the first International Series game, the pitch was upgraded to a partly artificial Desso surface) – England team manager Roy Hodgson having previously complained about the state of the surface after just two International Series games, claiming one player injured his ankle in 2014 because of the cut-up pitch. The issue of NFL markings still being partly visible during association football matches has also been criticized in the media. To test the implications of a full season at Wembley, the NFL scheduled two International Series games over two weekends, followed by an England association football game, to see how the surface copes. Wembley earns an estimated £500,000 to £1 million per NFL game in profit; due to the debt incurred in building it, the BBC commented that maximizing the number of other events staged at Wembley is vital to the FA's financial health, believing the benefit of the consistent revenue stream of 8 NFL games a year would not escape their attention. Although mindful of the calendar, according to the stadium's managing director speaking in 2013, \\"Football is our priority but yes, I'm absolutely confident that if Roger Goodell wanted to have a franchise here, we could absolutely deliver on it.\\" One possible method of accommodating the full schedule of an NFL franchise that the FA is investigating (as of 2014), is playing some home England fixtures at other football stadiums around the country, something which had not been done since the stadium had been reopened. A 10-year restriction on having to play all home games at Wembley expired in 2017, although Wembley remains the regular home of the team. Supporting the idea, the BBC contrasted the low attendances of some England football friendlies at Wembley, which reached a record low of 40,181 in 2014, surpassing the previous record of 48,876 in 2011, with the 80,000 crowds for the 2014 three game International Series. In April 2018, Jaguars owner Shahid Khan placed a bid on Wembley Stadium in an effort to solidify the Jaguars' presence in the city; this offer was retracted in October 2018. =Tottenham Hotspur Stadium= On July 8, 2015 it was announced that the NFL had agreed to stage a minimum of two games a season for a ten-year period at Tottenham Hotspur's new stadium in Northumberland Park, which opened nearly a year behind schedule in 2019. This was interpreted as boosting the chances of an eventual London franchise. As a result of the deal, the stadium was specifically designed for both American and association versions of football. It has a retractable natural grass pitch over an artificial surface used for NFL games (which should allow both soccer and NFL games to be played on the same weekend), and with locker rooms of sufficient size to accommodate the 53-man size of an NFL team roster. Its proposed capacity of 61,000 was described a being more appropriate for the day-to-day requirements of an NFL franchise than Wembley's 84,000. It has been suggested the design will also eliminate the issue at Wembley whereby the lowest 5,000 seats cannot be used because spectator views of the pitch are obstructed by the various officials, coaches and players who stand on the sidelines during an NFL game. The architect, Populous, had previously designed 14 NFL stadiums. =Twickenham Stadium= On November 3, 2015, the NFL also announced it had reached a deal with the Rugby Football Union to host a minimum of three games in three years at Twickenham Stadium, beginning from the 2016 International Series. The deal is designed to be flexible, i.e. it could involve two fixtures in one year and none the next. The deal also includes an option to add two more games in the same period. The three-game commitment was fulfilled in two years. All three games were held in October, as the venue is home of the England national rugby team during the November test matches. =Multiple stadiums= To resolve some of the issues, it has also been suggested a London franchise may use more than one of the suggested venues as their home stadium. Issues A number of issues need to be resolved before a London franchise can be set up; speaking in 2015 Waller stated \\"We feel very comfortable from a fan perspective, from a sponsor and a stadium perspective now, that we have all of the right things in place. The one thing that we’ve got to do more work on is how would it work from a team operational standpoint?\\" =Logistics= Speaking after talks with the UK government, Dan Marino argued that probably the biggest challenge facing a London franchise is the physical logistics of moving the staff and equipment across the Atlantic for every away game. To overcome this, he speculated that the NFL might follow the example of other sports like basketball and baseball, where some teams play away games in back to back series of three or four games, allowing the team to stay in the US for this part of their schedule. It has been noted that this approach may be problematic as it requires players to spend multiple weeks at a time away from home (whether home is in the US or London), something they would not have to do in a US based franchise. The NFL's use of a salary cap would also make using financial incentives to overcome this problematic. For the 2018 season, the league aims to test the concept of one of the teams playing back-to-back games in London.Breer, Albert (September 21, 2017). Game Plan: NFL Believes London is Ready for Team; 2022 Target is Doable. SI.com. Retrieved October 1, 2017. =Off-season and training camp= As well as the issue of a home stadium facility, the league has also been considering where a London franchise would hold their training camp, which begins in late July and normally involves several players not yet formally signed to the club. Similarly, another issue is whether or not it would have a base in the US for the off-season period, the gap between whenever their season ends until the start of the following training camp, in which the club will normally hold several meetings regarding staff and player contracts. As of 2014 the NFL had investigated the possibility of a London team establishing a permanent base in conjunction with a Premier League club, but it was considered unlikely for reasons of infrastructure and scheduling. The league has also considered establishing a secondary base, probably in the Southeastern United States, for the London club to use for circumstances when returning to London is impractical. =Fanbase= The NFL has set a target of reaching a total of 6 million \\"avid fans\\" in the UK before they will consider a London franchise viable, and surveys the UK annually to assess this figure; an avid fan being defined by the NFL as someone who says they're \\"extremely interested\\" in the NFL or that it is their favorite sport. Speaking during the 2015 International Series, Waller stated \\"We’re currently at four million, we were at about 2.3 million when the International Series started [in 2007]. We’re on track to reach that six million target by 2020.\\" Speaking at the start of 2016, he said \\"The fan base is big enough and passionate enough that it can support a franchise\\". It has been suggested that a significant stumbling block to creating the necessary fanbase is ironically the success of the NFL in promoting itself in the UK in the past. Many fans had been drawn into the NFL when the game was popularized in the 1980s, leading to evidence of support for all of the NFL's 32 teams in UK based fans, many of whom would be unlikely to support a London team as a first resort, i.e. being unlikely to consider them anything other than their favorite second team at best, and a potential rival at worst. As a result, while wishing to retain the support of anyone for a London team on a second favorite basis, the NFL's UK operation has been focussing on growing the fan base by reaching out to younger fans without an established allegiance, and others who are entirely new to the sport. The NFL's UK operation has pointed to the success of the 1995 expansion team the Carolina Panthers having grown a fanbase in a previously untapped market to support the idea that a London team could do the same. In an attempt to gauge support for a London team, from the 2015 season the dates and times of the International Series games were adjusted to make them more closely resemble the home fixtures of a London team, as opposed to casting them as one off special events being timed in a fashion more convenient for a US audience. As of the 2014 International Series, 9 out of 10 tickets for the games were bought by people who live within three hours' travel of London, with 33,000 people choosing to buy a package ticket for all three games. That number had risen to 40,000 repeat customers for the four-game package in 2017. The league has been encouraged by the fact that the International Series games were still attracting over 80,000 fans for a game like the Detroit Lions versus the Kansas City Chiefs on October 31, 2015, the teams which had the 24th and 31st best records in the NFL at game time, leading The Telegraph to observe that Middlesbrough vs Brentford would be the equivalent English soccer fixture on the day (based on their positions in the Football League Championship). =League schedule= The NFL and others have also recognised that the current arrangement of giving all teams that play an International Series game the following week off (a bye-week) as being impractical if a London franchise was created, leading to the need to either change the schedule, or persuade teams to play UK and US fixtures in adjacent weeks. The arrangement practiced by the University of Hawaii football team, separated from the U.S. mainland by about 3,900 km/2,400 miles, has been suggested as the model to follow for playing blocks of two to three games, home and away. While still retaining the bye- week, as a test of the logistics, the first game of the 2015 International Series was the first time teams only traveled to London for the weekend, having previously spent a whole week in the UK. =Competitiveness= The NFL is mindful of avoiding the perception that any potential London franchise was being established simply to increase the profile and revenue of the league; any team based in London must be competitive and be able to win the Super Bowl. The scheduling of the first back-to-back weekend fixtures in the 2015 International Series was also a test of a potential London franchise on competitiveness. One potential issue affecting competition that has been identified (by an NFL team owner) is what happens should a London franchise reach the post-season, which could possibly involve a long trip for a west coast based team to London, and then back to the US for the next weekend. In addition to the travel, it is believed this also presents a challenge in terms of potentially leaving away teams only a week to plan a foreign trip (in contrast to teams knowing the regular season schedule months in advance). While the International Series fixtures have tested the effect on personnel of traveling east from the USA to the UK and then playing a game within a few days, because of the bye week it has yet to be established what the effect is when traveling the other way. It has been suggested this may be tested by scheduling one team to play back-to-back weekends in the International Series (as the notional home and away team). Another issue considered is whether or not a London team would have an unfair competitive advantage compared to US- based teams, due to the extra distances away teams would have to travel to play them. =Tax= As of 2013, players appearing in International Series games were subject to UK tax on their income and endorsements on a pro rata basis. If expanded to a full slate of regular season games, it has been suggested that unless the government granted exemptions to attract the NFL, which have been applied to some but not all sports/athletes, then the difference between the UK and US tax codes would be have the effect of making the after-tax value of a player contract considerably less when signed by a UK-based team compared to a similar contract with a US-based team. Thus, if a London-based team was subjected to the same salary cap, it would difficult for the team to sign enough top-caliber free agents to make it a Super Bowl contender. The talks between the Chancellor and the NFL from 2014 onwards were interpreted by the media as a willingness to offer support in the form of promises of tax exemptions. =Visas= As of 2013, players appearing in International Series games were admitted on temporary working visas, a situation which would not be possible for players working a full home schedule, which would require visas to be issued by a UK government recognised governing body for the sport. Although the British version of the game is administered by the British American Football Association (BAFA), it is not recognised by the UK government for visa purposes. In order to clear these obstacles, it has been suggested the NFL would either have to create its own governing body in the UK, or work through BAFA after they gain approval. Although not expected to fail, it has been speculated that approval of the governing body could be conditional on restrictions being placed on the activities of the NFL in the UK that would not apply to US teams, depending on the government's view of how the visas benefit sport in the country. Analogies have been drawn to soccer, where players from outside the European Union must be shown to be bringing something \\"special and different\\", and teams are required to comprise a minimum number of EU citizens. Individual visas may still also be denied due to issues such as criminal convictions. =Health- related reasons= On 4 May 2020, the entirety of the scheduled 2020 International Series games, including the London games, were moved back to the home stadiums in the United States due to the international COVID-19 pandemic. This may imperil any London team proposal in the future, due to the logistics involved with complying with the future health policies and laws possible to prevent a future pandemic. =European Union law= As a member of the European Union (EU), much of the UK's laws are based on EU law. It has been suggested that the NFL's use of a draft system and a minimum age limit on players would come into conflict with the EU's laws regarding freedom of movement for workers and competition. Citing sports lawyer Andrew Nixon, ESPN suggested in 2013 that while the draft may be permissible for the same reasons it is in the US, the age restriction had no US analogy, and so how it would be interpreted by the European Commission would be difficult to predict. The impact of the Bosman ruling on players contracts is also unclear. It also argued that while the UK government would have more interest in making adjustments to accommodate a London team, the EU as a whole would have less to gain by adjusting its laws. A suggested workaround of the team being based in the US and simply flying in for games, Nixon said this was \\"not something that has been done before and it is untested\\". On June 23, 2016, the UK voted to leave the EU. A spokesperson for the NFL said that it was working closely with its UK offices and \\"monitoring\\" the situation closely. Nonetheless, some speculation has led to keep NFL owners on alert if the UK goes into a recession following an exit from the EU. =Collective bargaining agreement= Many aspects of NFL players' benefits and conditions are set down by the National Football League collective bargaining agreement, negotiated by the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), which could potentially impact the establishment of a London franchise. Last negotiated in 2011, the current version runs until the 2020 season. Speaking in September 2014, George Atallah, the NFLPA assistant executive director of external affairs, said of the issue that \\"A permanent team in London would require collective bargaining between the league and the players’ union and the NFL have not got to the point where they have said we want to raise it.\\" and \\"Most players enjoy the experience of going over to London and from our perspective a team based in the UK could be viable – but only if the working conditions and health and safety aspects are satisfactory\\".

He was one of the less known painters in the late 19th century and early 20th century in Catalonia, Spain. He was born in Vilassar de Dalt on September 10, 1850. He died in Barcelona in 1920. He is most known for performing some commissions for the Güell family, thanks to his friend and colleague, Antoni Gaudí. Early life Clapés was born in Vilassar de Dalt, Catalonia, in 1850. Very little information is known about his personal life. He was the youngest child in a large family. He was the son of Villa Teresa Puig and Antonio Pons Clapés. He was primarily raised in Vilassar. Later, he married Gumersinda, a woman from Rues. She was a widow who was originally married to Mariano Ferré Bergues and had two children. Clapés and Gumersinda later had a daughter together, Teresa.  Education  When he lived to Reus, Spain, he found his mentor and fellow painter Franco Hernandez. With a good understanding of the basic artistic skills, he went to Barcelona where he enrolled in the Escola de la Llotja where he learned from Claudi Lorenzale. Majority of Aleix Clapés' works were in opposition of Claudio Lorenzale, which led to Clapés being one of Lorenzale's favorite students. Lorenzale was active in a group called the Natzaren painters, which was a group of German painters who were led religiously by Frederick Overbeck. Clapés was a primary disciple of Friedrich Overbeck and was later appointed professor at the Escola de la Llotja. Clapés later went to Paris, France to further his education where he became a pupil of Eugène Carrière.Maspoch, Mònica. Galeria d'autors : ruta del modernisme, Barcelona. 1a ed.. Barcelona: Institut del Paisatge Urbà i la Qualitat de Vida, 2008, p. 71. It also is assumed that Clapés took lessons at the Academy of the Palette Utrillo. He moved to Uruguay and Rome. Where he worked on mural painting techniques. He also studied the works of Michelangelo and Raphael. Clapés’ best professional years occurred at the turn of the century. He received a minimal amount of social recognition during this time period. These accomplishments allowed him to purchase a home in the Rambla de Catalonia. He also opened a store, where he sold perfumes, gifts, and art objects.  Inspiration  The amount of artwork in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were rich in Catalonia, including such artists as Santiago Rusiñol, Ramon Casas, Antonio Gaudi, and Lluis Domenech i Montaner. Many of these people were colleagues as well as competitors in the art world with Clapés. Much of Clapés’ art brought individuals closer to spirituality, mysticism, and prevailing. He quickly gained confidence. Much of his style displayed had been influenced by Overbeck. He had a very colorful palette, closest to El Greco than to Overbeck. The public's lack of interest eventually blossomed into public recognition. His talent did not go unnoticed and quickly entered the studio of S. Juan Hernandez. He specialized in drawings and paintings, who from the outset was considered one of the best and most gifted students.  Career =Expo and Gaudi relationship= Clapés participated in an expo in 1888, where he began a close relationship with Antoni Gaudí. Gaudi hired him to work on the decoration of the Palau Güell in 1851. Where, he also held the position of director from 1858 to 1885. Clapés received notoriety for contributing to the paintings that decorated the halls of the palace and the great mural painting which occupied part of the front side. Despite his participation in important projects, such as the Palau Güell and La Pedrera, he enjoyed the minor recognition that his talent deserved. Antoni Gaudi's success seem to cloud Clapés' success in the involvement of these projects. Although, Gaudi's success also introduced Clapés to many opportunities that he may not have had without his close relationship with Gaudi. =Furniture= Clapés artistic abilities did not limit him to painting. He also excelled in designing carpets and furniture. This included close collaboration with Ibars Josep Ribas, a furniture maker and decorator, including furnishing designs for the Asylum Hospital de Sant Pau. During the construction of Palau Güell, Clapés also \\"created cabinet doors inserts, including twelve copper plates that contained the representation of apostles, one of whom is believed to be his self- portrait. In the living room are also his paintings that occupy the four corners the room. These are large-scale works and innovative aesthetics that stand to adapt perfectly to the unique architecture Gaudí proposed by tracing angles and beams of the room.\\" =Magazine= Clapés established and worked at the Magazine Hispania from 1899 to 1902. The Magazine Hispania was published bimonthly to display modern art and literature. During this time, Clapés was relatively popular. He made many commissions for the wealthy people. However, he was only able to keep it open until 1903 due to the expensive method of printing. =Literary competition= On August 14, 1887, a literary contest was held in Vilassar de Mar. An announcement was made on May 22, 1887 including the deadline for submission on July 31, 1887. Vilassar had adopted the model of the Floral Games of Barcelona as a catalyst for revitalization of the Catalan culture. The compositions were to be unpublished and original. It was the first organized event in Vilassar de Mar. The review panel was composed of Eduard Vidal Valenciano, Damasus Calvet, Angel Guimera, and Valentine Admiral Frederic Soler. Aleix Clapés won a prize for the best poem about \\"The Latin sea.\\" It was read by Damas Calvet. Artworks It appears that Aleix Clapés’ first works was the portrait of a famous poet, Joaquim Maria Bartins. It was later exhibited at the Reading Center of Rues. It is currently on display at the Rues City Hall. The portrait was painted during a time when Joaquim Maria Bartins was ill. It portrayed much of her pain and suffering during this time of illness. The portrait received great reviews by Lo Somatent, which was the first newspaper to be printer in Catalan Rues. He also painted a painting of Hercules on the exterior of the east side of the Palau Guell. Hercules was the mythical founder of Barcelona. Guell had an infatuation with Hercules. Hercules was present on the lateral wall parallel to the La Rambla in a large painting by Aleix Clapés. He also painted The Rapture on the walls of Palau Güell, where Hercules, the hero, had been portrayed as the main protagonist. He also painted El Prisionero. The English translation is \\"The Prisoner\\". It was charcoal drawing on the Civil War in Uruguay. He also painted El Peon (English translation: \\"The Pawn\\"). It was purchased by Trotsky in Paris in 1920 for 2,000,000 francs, which was France's currency prior to the euro. It was then taken to Kremlin. Trotsky was the organizer of the Red Army and advocated for forced military drafts. Clapés' Hercules Searching for the Hesperides was painted with oil on canvas circa 1890. It was donated to Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya by Maria Lluisa Guell in 1928, but as of January 2016 is on loan to the Palau Güell.

A child prodigy, she performed her first composition at a recital at the age of 5 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and went on to study at the Juilliard School in New York City. She composed hundreds of pieces, including music for piano, violin, voice, flute, clarinet and cello, as well as for chamber ensembles. She performed all over Canada and in Boston and New York, including performances at Carnegie Hall and The Town Hall, and with the Boston Civic Symphony and the Boston Pops. The New York Times called her \\"a rare phenomenon among the younger pianists of today – more musician than pianist\\". She also taught musical composition to young children, creating and patenting a game called \\"Staftonia\\" for this purpose. Early life and education She was born Minuetta Shumiatcher in Gomel, Russia, the eldest child of Abraham Isaac Shumiatcher, a self-taught lawyer, and his wife, Luba Lubinsky, a graduate of the University of Warsaw who worked as a tutor for children in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Her parents had moved to Calgary before her birth, but her mother was visiting her native country when Minuetta was born. Her paternal grandfather, Judah Shumiatcher, is said to have brought the first Torah scroll to Calgary. A paternal uncle, Morris Shumiatcher, founded SmithBilt Hats, which manufactured the famed white cowboy hats that became a symbol of Calgary. She had a younger brother, Dr. Morris C. Shumiatcher, who became a noted Canadian lawyer. Minuetta was recognized as a child prodigy at the age of 5, when she performed her own composition in a piano recital held by the studio of John M. Williams and Shaylor Turner. According to a reviewer, her performance was \\"one of the surprises of the evening\\", as she \\"played her own composition in a most expressive manner\\". The following year, at age 6, she performed another original composition at the annual recital, which also featured her aunt, 10-year-old Bella Shumiatcher. At the latter recital, a reviewer wrote, \\"The precocity of this six year old is surprising\\". She went on to study piano under Gladys McKelvie Egbert in Calgary. At the age of 15 she received a full scholarship to study at the Juilliard School in New York City, where she studied under Ernest Hutcheson and Ania Dorfmann. She also studied composition under Ivan Langstroth at Juilliard. She graduated from Juilliard in 1934 and engaged in post-graduate studies until 1936, as well as taught piano at Juilliard for several years. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen around 1940.  Music career =Pianist and composer= Minuetta Kessler Kessler made her U.S. debut at The Town Hall in New York City in 1945. She went on to perform more than 50 solo concert programs on WNYC. She also played at Carnegie Hall, with the Boston Civic Symphony, and with the Boston Pops. In March 1962 she performed in a program featuring all of her own compositions at the Boston Conservatory of Music. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation featured her performances in its Distinguished Artists and Masters of the Keyboard series. She was recorded playing her own compositions on \\"Music for Solo Instruments\\" (1978, AFKA SK-288) and \\"Childhood Cameos\\" (1981, AFKA SK-4663). She continued to perform into her seventies. Kessler composed hundreds of pieces, including music for piano, violin, voice, flute, clarinet and cello, as well as for chamber ensembles. One of her most acclaimed compositions was the Alberta Concerto for Piano and Orchestra, which she premiered on CBC Radio in 1947 and went on to perform with orchestras across Canada and in Boston. In 1975 she performed the piece with the Century Calgary Symphony Orchestra in honor of Calgary's centennial celebrations. =Technique= The Boston Globe described her keyboard technique as \\"formidable\\" and The Christian Science Monitor praised her \\"dash and verve\\" and \\"ear for color\\". After the 1947 premiere of her Alberta Concerto for Piano and Orchestra, the L'Événement-Journal wrote that she \\"plays with a power rarely attained by women pianists\\". Her 1975 reprisal of the Alberta Concerto with the Calgary Century Symphony Orchestra generated this review by the Calgary Albertan: > Minuetta Kessler is a most refined pianist and her own Alberta Concerto is > in every sense a work of great magnitude. It is a kind of 19th-century > romantic piece in four movements in which Kessler's hands were most > effectively used. She played with authority, feeling and sensitivity. =Piano teacher and lecturer= Kessler moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1952; the following year she and her second husband, Dr. Myer M. Kessler, relocated to Belmont, Massachusetts, where she lived the rest of her life. She operated her own publishing company, Music Resources, from her home.

She specialized in teaching musical composition to young children, creating and patenting a game called \\"Staftonia\\" (1960) for this purpose. She also used a \\"simplified notational system\\" called \\"Dash-a-Notes\\" in her music primer, Piano Is My Name (1975). In the late 1970s and early 1980s she published numerous composition books, including Savory Suite (1980), The Improper Grasshopper (1980), Cat 'n Mouse Tails (1981), Playful Squirrels (1981), A Day in the Park (1981), Jewish Easy Piano Pieces (1981), My Toys (1982), and Come to the Circus! (1984). Kessler lectured and conducted workshops for music teachers, and wrote articles for such publications as The American Music Teacher, the Christian Science Monitor, Clavier, Massachusetts Music News, and Piano Guild Notes. Memberships Kessler co-founded the New England Jewish Music Forum in 1958. She also helped establish Concerts in the Home and Friends of Young Musicians. She served as president of the New England Piano Teachers' Association (1965–1967), the American Women Composers of Massachusetts, and the Massachusetts Music Teachers Association (1979–1981). She belonged to the Beth El Temple Center in Belmont. Awards and honors Kessler was a two-time recipient of the CAPAC Prize, for her \\"New York Suite\\" in 1946 and \\"Ballet Sonatina\\" in 1947.

Earlier structures have rounded gables and are of drystone construction, typical of buildings roofed with thatch. Later ones have the squared gables which became common when corrugated iron became the preferred roofing material.Ross of Mull Historical Centre (2004) Discover The Ross..., p. 38. Bunessan, Ross of Mull Historical Centre The site is known to have been fully abandoned by the 1940s.  Designation as a Scheduled Monument  The remains of the settlement were given Scheduled Monument designation by Historic Scotland on 20 January 2004. The decision was made on the grounds that it was of national importance as a source of information about post-medieval, and possibly medieval, settlement and economy. The scheduling decision also note that the site's importance is increased by the cartographic and archeological evidence that it was occupied and adapted over a period of at least several hundred years.  Bronze age barrow and standing stones  Slightly to the south of the township ruins is another scheduled monument consisting of a prehistoric barrow and several standing stones. The barrow is typical of the type believed to be used as funerary monuments dating to the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age (3000 -2000 BC).Ross of Mull Historical Centre (2004) Discover The Ross..., p. 39. Bunessan, Ross of Mull Historical Centre The scheduling decision, made in 1963, was based upon the fact that the burial mound may be expected to contain information relating to the techniques used in its construction and use.

Formed in 2003, their initial lineup consisted of guitarist Matt Hollenberg, drummer Larry Kwartowitz, vocalist Nick Shellenberger and bassist Chris Weindel. After their first EP Chris Weindel was replaced by James Lynch, who was succeeded by bassist Daniel Ephraim Kennedy in 2012. Informed by metal pioneers such as Meshuggah, Converge, Fantômas, and Neurosis, the band is known for their experimental approach to grindcore, doom and avant-garde metal. Cleric has released three studio albums: Regressions (2010), Retrocausal (2017) and Chokhma (2018) History=Formation and early success (2003–2010)= Cleric was formed in 2003 and quickly debuted with an extended play titled The Underling, which was recorded for $200. The band began composing music for film, working with a slasher film series called Punk Rock Holocaust and the alternative porn outlet Burning Angel. In 2008, the band received a nomination for Best Music at the AVN Awards for their contribution to a pornographic film parody of Party Monster, titled Porny Monster. Their demo Allotriophagy and 7\\" single Cumberbund also garnered some favorable reviews and critical notice. Afterward, the band was signed to Web of Mimicry run by Trey Spruance, best recognized for his work in Secret Chiefs 3 and Mr. Bungle. =Regressions and tour (2010–present)= The band released their full-length debut album, titled Regressions, on April 27, 2010. It was produced by Colin Marston, who credited the album with being the most time consuming and challenging job in his career due to the density and complexity of the compositions. The album received positive markups from critics, who praised the band for their aggressive demeanor and willingness to experiment. In describing the band's sound, Philip Montoro of the Chicago Reader said \\"the music this Philadelphia four-piece plays is a kind of metal the way Lost Highway is a kind of movie. It's an elastic tissue of creepy electronic noise and barely human screaming, impregnated with patches of riff- salad grind and hypercube mathcore.\\" In September 2010, the band was robbed of a substantial amount of equipment and gear after a show in Brooklyn, effectively halting their recording and touring momentum. They managed to recoup some of their losses by tracking down a portion stolen goods in pawn shops and asking fans to donate to the band's Kickstarter. In 2013, the band announced the delayed tour in support of their debut album and released the Resumption digital single. Cleric also returned to the studio with producer Colin Marston and entered pre-production on a new album. Also planned is a compilation of music they've composed for films over a past three period. In early November, Cleric began their first country-wide tour, which lasted until December. The band's second album was titled Retrocausal and released on December 8, 2017 by Web of Mimicry. In August of the following year the box set The Book Beri'ah, containing Cleric's third album Chokhma, was released by Tzadik Records.

Ahmed. The film features an ensemble cast, including Udhayanidhi Stalin, Hansika Motwani, Radha Ravi, Prakash Raj, and Vivek. Aishwarya Rajesh, and Krishna Kumar. Based on Subhash Kapoor's Hindi film Jolly LLB (2013), which itself being loosely based on the 1999 Delhi hit-and- run case, the story—which revolves around a junior lawyer who, after a period of struggle and ridicule among colleagues, fights a case against a powerful supreme court lawyer—was slightly altered from a comedy-drama genre in the original to a drama-thriller theme. Manithan was released on 29 April 2016 to highly positive reviews.  Plot  The film begins with a drunk Rahul Dewan (Suraj) racing in a Toyota Land Cruiser Prado against an Audi, after he is seduced by a woman in the passenger seat. He loses control and crashes into a wall on the footpath by the road. The film cuts to a court scene where Sakthivel (Udhayanidhi Stalin), an LLB (law-degree) graduate defending a surgeon against a Public interest litigation (PIL) filed against him after the surgeon had his son operate upon a pregnant woman in his pursuit of Guinness Book of World Records. Sakthi loses the case but decides to move to the capital Chennai to try his luck. He happens to see prominent criminal lawyer Adhiseshan (Prakash Raj) defending Rahul in a sessions court. Rahul is accused of causing death under the influence of alcohol. Adhiseshan convinces the judge that prosecution had no evidence to implicate Rahul and that he was being deliberately targeted by the media as he was from a rich family, resulting in Rahul's acquittal. Adhiseshan, though, is not satisfied with the fee paid by the Dewans. Sakthi, desperate to have some money and fame, decides to pursue the case and files a PIL in the court against Rahul Dewan's acquittal. After initially reprimanding Sakthi for his mistakes in filing the PIL and taking the press reports as an evidence, Justice Dhanapal (Radha Ravi) gives a date for hearing and warns Sakthi to collect some evidence before the hearing. He then runs into Vijay Nair (Krishna Kumar), who claims to have witnessed the accident. Then Sakthi introduces him as a witness in the court and Dhanapal, after cross-examining him, gives a date for the next hearing. He also summons Rahul to be present in the court for the hearing. Sakthi becomes a celebrity overnight and is admired by Moorthy, who donates a room in his restaurant to Sakthi for using it as his office. However, Sakthi's plans turn upside down when Vijay reveals to him that he is no witness, but a crony of Adhiseshan and it was part of a plan to extract more money from the Dewan clan. As part of the deal, Nair gives Sakthi his share of the money paid by the Dewans to silence Nair. Sakthi gleefully accepts the money and regrets that had he known this plan earlier, he would have demanded more money. Nair turns hostile in the court, and Sakthi accepts the statement given by Nair. Dhanapal postpones the judgement for the next hearing. Priya Dharmalingam (Hansika Motwani), the cousin and fiancée of Sakthi, chides him for compromising on justice for his greed. Sakthi realises his mistake once. Moorthy slaps him for his treachery. He returns the money to Adhiseshan and challenges him to win the case. With the help of his uncle Surya (Vivek), Sakthi collects the video footage of the Land Cruiser involved in the accident and presents it to the court. Though Adhiseshan counters him that the Land Cruiser was driven by the driver of the Dewan family, Sakthi refutes his statement by submitting the necessary evidence. Dhanapal orders the Police to provide a bodyguard for Sakthi after he was seriously beaten up by alleged assistants of Adhiseshan. Sakthi and his friends try to interview a relative of one of the victims, Muthupandi, but he says that he knows nothing. Sakthi and Priya decide to leave, but as they get on the scooter, a lorry hits them, injuring Priya. At the hospital, Muthupandi tells Sakthi that a survivor of the accident stays in Vandavasi and Sakthi and one of his friends decides to leave for Vandavasi. Inspector Selvam (Cheranraj) tries to sabotage Sakthi's investigation but is rescued by his bodyguard. Sakthi and Jennifer (Aishwarya Rajesh) arrive at Vandavasi, but the police, who captured Muthupandi, kidnap the survivor. The next day, Sakthi reveals that he brought the survivor, thanks to Muthupandi intentionally showing the police the wrong man, and Sakthi prosecutes Selvam and finds that he has botched up the investigation by declaring Kamalakannan (Raja Rishi) as dead and snatching Kamalakannan's hard- earned money to stop him from killing Kannan. Kamalakannan testifies that he woke up that night to see his family lying in a pool of blood and Rahul getting out of the car, and after seeing what he has done, Rahul spotted Kamalakannan and ran him over with his car, so no there will be no witnesses. Kamalakannan survived, with his leg being broken. Dhanapal tells Rahul to come to the podium and orders Kannan to see if Rahul was the driver. Kannan confirms that Rahul was the one who drove the Land Cruiser. After a conclusion of arguments and counter-arguments between Adhiseshan and Sakthi, Dhanapal directs the Tamil Nadu Police to suspend Selvam and initiate a criminal inquiry against him and also declares Rahul as guilty of the crime and sentences him to 14 years in jail under Section 304 and under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code. The film ends with Sakthi celebrating with his team, while Adhiseshan is crestfallen as he suffers defeat for a first time.

First palace Engraving of the palace published in the volume X of Diccionario geográfico-estadístico-histórico de España y sus posesiones de ultramar by Pascual Madoz, in 1850. Its plant formed a rectangle parallelogram, consisting each of its four facades of three floors that were in all them in the same horizontal plan, serving as entrance to the building a spacious garden, which occupied the site of the old Convento de la Natividad y San José A portal with three entries, ornate with pillars, separated this garden from the Calle de Alcalá. The building dates from early 19th century. It was built as a dowry for the Duchess of Abrantes, for which circumstance was designated with the name of \\"la casa de los alfileres\\" (the house of the pins). In the new building lived the Marquis of Ariza, the Russian ambassador, Prince Tatischef, and the famous provisionist of the French army and great financial Gabriel-Julien Ouvrard, in 1823 and 1824, at which time were held on its halls magnificent soirees and banquets, until it acquired the Catalan Marquis of Riera, who invested large sums in the decoration. The extension of the house and gardens was considerable, besides providing in front, on calle del Turco, other big housing for garages and offices, with which had connexion through a tunnel. Second palace (Second) Palacio del Marqués de Casa Riera (c. 1915). On 1893 the first palace was demolished, and the Marquis of Casa Riera's nephew, Alejandro Riera Mora rose another palace.

On 23 July 1935, PVV defeated DRD 11–2 in the Surinamese Hoofdklasse, the league record for highest scoring match. Hans Nahar scored 7 goals in the match for PVV, which is also a record for most goals scored in a single match. The record for most goals scored was reached by SV Voorwaarts player Purcy Samsey on 26 June 1955, before Louis Mijnals of SV Robinhood improved the record on 26 November 1961. It is also worth mentioning that PVV lost their following match to MVV 8–1 on 2 August 1935. In 1993 the club also won the Suriname President's Cup defeating S.V. Transvaal 2–1 in the final. Since the 2011–12 season, PVV have been relegated to the amateur district leagues in Suriname. In 2015 the club returned to the Eerste Klasse.

Founding  The Negro Labor Committee (NLC) was founded in 1935 and was a major step in the advancement of the rights of black workers. It was the successor to a number of organizations founded by Crosswaith, a longtime Socialist Party and labor activist. The first was the American Federation of Labor Trade Union Committee for Organizing Negro Workers, founded in December 1924. Despite being supported by the Central Trades and Labor Council of New York, the group was hampered by the unwillingness of local unions to accept black members and it was apparently defunct by 1926.Gary Fink ed. Labor unions Greenwood Encyclopedia of American Institutions Westport, Connecticut, Greenwood Press 1977 p.251 In 1934 Crosswaith founded the Harlem Labor Committee, an organization of both black and white workers who sought higher wages, better working conditions and improved benefits. The HLC called the First Negro Labor Conference in July 20, 1935. The meeting of 110 black and white workers voted to create a permanent Negro Labor Committee, which aimed to help African-American find better paying jobs. and to prevent them from being used as labor scabs. The Committee also wished to open union membership to African-Americans in localities that had excluded them from membership through clauses in their constitutions, by-laws and rituals or had \\"covertly discriminate against the Negro worker by practices more eloquent and effective than pronouncements, resolutions, or Constitutions can ever be\\". Crosswaith was elected Chairmen. Other officers included A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters as Vice Chairman, Thomas Young of the Building Service Employees Union, Julius Hochman of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, Abraham Miller of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, and Morris Feinstone of the United Hebrew Trades, Treasurer, Philip Kapp Joint Board, Dressmakers Union, Financial Secretary, Winifred Gittens also ILGWU, and Organizer Noah A. Walter Jr. of the Laundry Workers Union.  Activities and goals  The Committee established the Harlem Labor Center at 312 West 125th Street. This served as a home for the legitimate workers in Harlem for both black and white workers. The Committee also created the Negro Labor News Service, which disseminated news throughout the country. In 1941 the NLC was involved in the March on Washington Movement which pressured Franklin D. Roosevelt to create the Fair Employment Practice Committee. In 1946 Crosswaith declared that Harlem had changed from a community of scabs into a community of labor conscious workers.

History  In the Middle Ages there was a small castle on the Habsberg known as Habsberg Castle, of which a cistern has survived to the present day. The origin of the pilgrimage is associated with the construction of the first chapel around 1680. According to local accounts a man fell from the Helfenburg near Lengenfeld fell very ill with gout. As he prayed, he heard a voice that said to him that he should build a chapel on the Habsberg. So the estate was purchased and, in 1682, the chapel was completed. The Habsberg became well known for being the site of several miraculous healings. As a result, in 1730 a larger chapel was built. In 1760 the church of Our Lady of Health (Maria Heil der Kranken) was built in the rococo style. Today it is the pilgrimage church. In 1961 a youth house was built which has been remodelled several times. Halfway up the mountain is a woodland cemetery.

Retrieved January 13, 2016, from http://decisions.fct- cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/67252/1/document.do In 1977, he returned to Italy, travelling between countries several times. He returned to Canada on December 12, 2009, to Woodbridge, Ontario, where he settled with his wife, Carla Calabro, who is a Canadian citizen. He has five children; his daughter Melina, a Canadian citizen, married Italian mobster Antonio Coluccio, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2018 for corruption, and his son Carlo, a Canadian citizen, serving a six-year sentence for the Italian crime of mafia association. Wanted in Italy for mafia association and deportation In 2008, Bruzzese was charged, and faced a trial in Italy, on the allegation that he was associated with the Rizzuto crime family of Montreal; he was later acquitted of this charge. In September 2010, an arrest warrant was issued by the Italian authorities pursuant to article 416-bis of the Italian Criminal Code, which deals with mafia association, and later registered on April 30, 2018, with Interpol as a red notice. However, he was not extradited because there is no charge in Canada for association with a mafia-like organization under the IRPA. On August 21, 2013, a section 44 IRPA report was written alleging that Bruzzese is inadmissible to Canada under paragraph 37(1)(a) of the IRPA for membership in the 'Ndrangheta criminal organization. On August 22, 2013, a warrant was issued for his arrest, and the next day, Bruzzese was arrested and detained by the immigration authorities at his Woodbridge home on the allegation of being unlikely to appear and of being a danger to the public. He was detained at Maplehurst Correctional Complex. At his May 2014 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) hearing, there was a heightened security presence after Carmine Verduci, a 'Ndrangheta member and close associate of Bruzzese's, was gunned down two weeks prior. At another IRB hearing, Bruzzese had admitted under oath that he had his children physically bring large sums of cash from Italy on a regular basis instead of using bank wire, transfers or electronic transfers; he also acknowledged during his testimony that he drove a BMW registered in another person's name whose last name he did not know; he claimed medications prescribed to another person as his own; and he also bought a $600,000 home in Canada with one of his sons despite stating in the hearing that he did not earn enough money in Canada to file a tax return. In August 2015, the IRB issued a deportation order for Bruzzese. Bruzzese appealed the decision to the Federal Court of Canada, but it was rejected, and on October 2, 2015, Bruzzese was escorted onto a plane in Toronto, landing in Rome, where he was arrested by Italian police. Major Giuseppe De Felice, a commander with the Carabinieri, told the IRB that Bruzzese \\"assumed the most important roles and decisions. He gave the orders.\\" As of 2017, he awaits trial in Italy for a possibe 10-year sentence for mafia association.

On that date, the Communist Workers Party (CWP) led by Robert Johnson gathered at the Morningside Homes in Greensboro, North Carolina, to protest for social and economic justice along with protesting against the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). The chant that united the 40–50 protesters was “death to the Klan”. Shortly after 11 am, a nine-vehicle convoy that contained 37 members of the KKK and the American Nazi Party arrived. After a short skirmish, the KKK and American Nazis retrieved their firearms and moments later, five protesters lay dead and ten others were wounded. During the marking of the 20th anniversary of the events that became known as the “Greensboro massacre”, the idea was raised to bring closure and to bring to light the truth to the events of November 3, 1979. Within five years, The Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission was formed by mainly private and local donations. The seven commissioners in 2006 released their report, which condemned not only the KKK and the American Nazi Party, but also the Greensboro Police Department and the city itself for being responsible for the events of November 3, 1979, and the subsequent cover-up.  Events of November 3, 1979  On November 3, 1979, a group numbering between 40 and 50 demonstrators arrived at the Morningside Housing projects in Greensboro, North Carolina at 11 a.m. for a peaceful march, aimed at advancing social, economic and racial justice and to protest against the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). The march, organized by Nelson Johnson of the Communist Workers Party and set to begin at twelve noon, was confronted by a convoy of nine vehicles, containing 37 members of the KKK and the American Nazi Party. These members proceeded to leave their vehicles, confronted the protesters with long pieces of lumber, igniting a violent fight. After a short skirmish, members of the KKK and the American Nazi Party retreated to their vehicles and retrieved their firearms, including shotguns, semi-automatic rifles, and pistols. A number of individuals began to fire their weapons, lasting a span of eighty-eight seconds, at the protesters. Five protesters, Cesar Cauce, Dr. James Waller, Sandra Smith, Bill Simpson and Dr. Michael Nathan, were killed, and ten others wounded. Nelson Johnson was, for his part, tackled by law enforcement, detained, and ultimately arrested for starting a riot. Johnson later stated, “I knew that in the depths of my soul that we had been set up.” A curfew was immediately implemented at the Morningside neighborhood, followed by the deployment of the North Carolina National Guard, and public service announcements to deter anyone from participating in any further marches. At a neighboring area adjacent to the Morningside Housing Project, Claudette Burroughs-White was home when a child ran up to her and informed her of the events he witnessed. “I thought he was losing his mind. When I found out that it was the truth, I was just so angry. It was scary that in broad daylight the Klan was shooting. You start gathering up your children and say come in this house until we find out what’s going on. [The fact that] you can look on television and see people just shooting people, and at the end of all of that, nobody gets a day in prison time. It is still unbelievable. It is just unbelievable.” These events, termed the “Greensboro Massacre,” were captured live by the press and profiled on national news outlets including the CBS Evening News, anchored by Walter Cronkite. The “Greensboro Massacre” would ironically be quickly overshadowed the following day with the onset of the Iran Hostage Crisis. Funeral services for the protesters were attended by upwards of 800 people, with 1,000 law enforcement officials specifically assigned to maintain social order in Greensboro.  The commission  The impetus for the establishment of the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission emerged in conjunction with the twentieth anniversary of the events of November 3, 1979. The driving force behind the creation of the commission was to objectively review precisely what transpired that day. For years, rumours circulated suggesting that the Greensboro Police Department was directly involved, and that the city, in order to protect its police department and itself, immediately undertook steps following the massacre to initiate a cover up. A commission, its supporters argued, could bring closure to the families of the deceased, as well as the remaining survivors. Between November 3, 1979, and November 3, 1999, three significant criminal and civil cases directly pertaining to the “Greensboro Massacre” unfolded. In the case of the first two trials – the second of which was a federal court case – all- white juries acquitted the accused parties, despite eyewitness testimony and above all, video news footage of the KKK and the American Nazi Party shooting at the crowd of protesters. The third trial case, focusing on the death of one of the “Greensboro Massacre” victims, resulted in the conviction of two Greensboro Police officers, four Klansmen, and two members of the American Nazi Party. The city of Greensboro was ordered to pay $351,500 in restitution. This judicial finding and associated financial penalty suggested that the city of Greensboro and its police department were more prominently involved and directly aware of the events of November 3, 1979, than previously suggested. These reasons directly contributed to the establishment of the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The Greensboro Truth and Community Reconciliation Project, or simply “the Project”, founded in November 1999, called for an independent truth and reconciliation commission to be created to investigate the events of November 3, 1979. The principal and most immediate issue confronting the establishment of a potential commission was the ability to secure necessary funding to undertake the required work. Significant funding primary was ultimately donated by the Andrus Family Fund, with the International Center for Transitional Justice providing supplementary financial support. The overriding objectives of the Andrus Family Fund and the Project itself were not punitive in nature; they were not seeking to legally or financially sanction the responsible parties (i.e., the KKK and the American Nazi Party), but instead sought to identify constructive avenues designed to facilitate societal reconciliation. This reconciliation, it was held, could be most fully realized by utilizing an approach that objectively examined the truth surrounding the Greensboro Massacre. It was later decided in October 2002, to remove the term “Massacre” in respect to the victims and survivors. On January 10, 2003, 32 prominent Greensboro community members with ties to both the city and county government, including then city councilor Claudette Burroughs-White, declared their support for the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission. A process was identified for the selection of seven volunteer commissioners to serve on what would come to be known as the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The mandate of the Commission was decidedly specific – no matter how painful it might prove to be, its core mission would be to reveal and disseminate the truth. From a total of 67 nominees put forward in February 2004, the selection committee was given 90 days to agree on 7 commissioners. This committee, in considering applicants, was empowered to consider an applicant's character and relationship to Greensboro. Specific characteristics that the selection committee sought out included “demonstrating commitment to the values of truth, reconciliation, equity and justice; will commit to seek the truth; will commit to not allow outside forces to taint the work/report of the commissioners; interest in racial, socio-economic, religious and gender diversity; and knowledge of human rights and legal framework.” On May 27, 2004, the seven commissioners (five women and two men) were publicly announced; the list included Muktha Jost, Bob Peters, Barbara Walker, Pat Clark, Cynthia Brown, Angela Lawrence, and Mark Sills. Three (Jost, Brown and Lawrence) were African American, and Lawrence, Sills (who also served on the selection committee) and Brown were native North Carolinians. = Research conducted = Initially, the commission encountered significant difficulty in collecting statements from the survivors, as many individuals were wary of the commission's mandate and its ability to effect durable social change. The commission was ultimately successful in securing the cooperation of survivors by conducting one-on-one interviews. This resulted in the collection of 145 oral statements. The commission also granted requests from a dozen individuals (who wished to remain anonymous), to include their statements in the final report. Included in the oral statements were testimonials of 17 demonstrators and 14 people from the-then Morningside Homes (which were demolished in 2002), along with 7 written accounts. The Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission was also successful in obtaining statements from six current or former Greensboro police officers, five current or former members of the KKK and the American Nazi Party, and a judge. Three public hearings were held (two at local area universities, and one at a high school), each of which transpired over a two-day period (Friday and Saturday). For the commissioners' safety, each public hearing featured a significant police presence. Following the conclusion of the first hearing, Bongani Finca, a commissioner on the South Africa Truth and Reconciliation Commission reminded commissioners that, “your credibility is on the line; you need to be pressing for answers. You can be respectful, but you need to ask tougher questions.” The ability of the commission, however, to secure additional statements was constrained by a range of factors: # People were ultimately unwilling to provide statements for fear of retaliation; # the commission was not given direct subpoena powers; # a police attorney advised retired Greensboro police officers from providing statements; and, # the newspaper editor of the Greensboro News and Record instructed his staff members not to provide statements. To avoid scrutiny, the newspaper agreed to let the commission have access to its archives. All five of the victims' widows also gave permission to the commission to grant immunity to any individual willing to offer a testimonial, so more information and statements could be collected. Members of the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission, in the course of their work, realized that there was not a consensus in Greensboro on which parties or specific actions were culpable, nor on who constituted a victim. = Findings = On May 25, 2006, the commission “held a ceremony in the chapel at Bennett College for Women to release its final report to the public.” Totaling in excess of 500 pages, the commission's report found that Nelson Johnson did indeed plan the march, which was state-wide, for the stated purposes of promoting social, economic and racial justice. Johnson had also followed proper procedure by applying for a parade permit from the Greensboro Police Department, listing Morningside Homes as the starting point for the march. The police, however, gave their informant, Klan member Eddie Dawson, a copy of the permit which provided the exact route and time of the march. The report also revealed that the police were well aware of the history between, on the one hand, the KKK and the American Nazi Party, and the Communist Workers Party (CWP) on the other. There had been an earlier confrontation between the groups in China Grove, North Carolina, and it was clear that the KKK and the American Nazi Party were purposely looking for an opportunity to exact revenge. The police also knew that it was the intention of both the KKK and the American Nazi Party to confront the protesters, make an attempt to prevent the march from occurring, and above all, that members from each group would very likely be armed with firearms. The police further knew that if the march was in fact disrupted, that Klan and American Nazi Party members would be acting in direct violation of the protesters' right of free speech and their right to assemble, both of which are protected in the First Amendment of the United States constitution. In advance of the march, Johnson was required by the Greensboro police to sign a form agreeing that he and his fellow protesters and he would not be armed. Though some did defy the agreement, North Carolina laws in 1979 did not make it illegal for the protesters to carry weapons. The commission found, “The idea of armed self-defense is acceptable and deeply embedded in our national identity and tradition [yet] there is a double standard by which armed black people are seen as an unacceptable threat.” Johnson, the report of the commission makes clear, was never notified or warned in advance by Greensboro police of the Klan and American Nazi Party's intentions regarding the march. The police went so far as to purposely station all of its officers in a perimeter some five to twenty-four blocks away from the Morningside Housing Projects. When Officer April Wise and her colleague were at the Morningside Homes to investigate an act of domestic violence, they were intentionally called back by their superiors. Police in the field were effectively ordered to stay at their posts. They did this even when a plainclothes officer reported the approaching caravan of KKK and American Nazi Party members. Greensboro police officers even stayed put after the shootings, deciding to only stop the last car in the caravan. Immediately following the “Greensboro Massacre”, the commission's report found that the city of Greensboro took immediate and significant steps to purposely deflect critical attention and deliberately conceal critical facts from the public. The Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Report underscores the “intentionality [of the Greensboro Police] to provide adequate protection and deliberately [mislead] the public in regarding what happened on November 3, 1979.” The report further claimed that compelling “evidence of deliberate manipulation and concealment of the facts that we can only interpret as intended to sever the Greensboro Police Department from any responsibility” existed. Greensboro's mayor and other city officials, the commission's report advances, went so far as to intimidate news stations to not broadcast footage of the “Greensboro Massacre.” \\"The events of November 3, 1979 and the days that followed produced “general distrust of police, the justice system, elected officials and the media.” The commission found that the police department had underestimated the threat posed by the KKK and the American Nazi Party, and overestimated their perceived threat of Johnson and the CWP. = Recommendations = The commission offered several recommendations. * First, as a city, it was recommended that Greensboro undertake meaningful gestures to acknowledge the events of November 3, 1979. The commission, for example, recommended the issuance of public and private apologies to those harmed and affected by the events. * Second, the Greensboro Police Department was strongly encouraged to issue a public apology, issue compensation, and erect public exhibitions about November 3, 1979. * A third recommendation suggested the need to reform institutional practices of local government by paying all of its city workers a fair and decent wage, while training them along with county workers on antiracism. * The fourth recommendation advanced by the commission called for increased funding for low-income residents, via the Department of Social Services and Public Health. * Fifth, along with educating school children about what transpired on November 3, 1979, the commission recommended a citizens review board to examine the workings of the Greensboro Police Department. * Next was a call to expand the lists and field of potential jurors, so that all future impaneled juries could fairly represent the community by avoiding the selection of all- white juries. * Seventh, a list of current allegations of corruption by the Greensboro Police Department should be made public and fully investigated. * The commission also encouraged the use of criminal and civil lawsuits, to encourage people's faith in the justice system and to hold the Greensboro Police Department accountable. * The ninth and arguably the most important recommendation of the commission was a call for active and vigilant citizen engagement. Examples provided included, attending education programs that focus on anti racism and diversity, so the community can be well versed on a range of subjects including privilege, oppression, and economic and social justice. The community was recommended to work together to find solutions to everyday problems, couple with a need for study and dialogue groups, aimed at examining the beliefs and ideologies held by the Greensboro community.  Reactions  The work of the commission and its subsequent recommendations elicited both positive and negative responses. The commission's report, according to Nelson Johnson, was a “gift” suggesting others in the community of Greensboro needed to read and benefit from it. An editorial on the commission's final report, authored by Allen Johnson of the Greensboro News & Record, found that as an “overall body of work, the report is well researched and documented”, and that, “despite its flaws and arguably even because of them, the report provides a valuable opportunity for reflection.” The mayor of Greensboro, Jim Melvin, on November 3, 1979, – within a day or two of the final report being made public - stated that, “I’ll stand on the reputation of the police department. We had a good police department on November 3[rd.]” Keith Holliday, who was Greensboro's mayor when the report was publicly issued, decided to reject the commission's recommendations calling for the Greensboro police department and the city itself to apologize for what happened on November 3, 1979. Holliday instead preferred to simply express regret for the events of that day. Two Democratic Guilford County Commissioners expressed their support for the commission's specific recommendations in favor of a living wage and antiracist training – both of which were opposed by a Republican-controlled Guilford County commission.

Potter made early contributions to the understanding of Rh disease. She established the link between a characteristic facial appearance and the absence of fetal kidneys, an association that became known as Potter sequence. After retiring from medical practice, Potter became known for her involvement in horticulture. Early life Potter was born in Clinton, Iowa, to William Harvey Potter and the former Edna Rugg Holmes. Her father was a locomotive engineer. She lived in Wisconsin and Minnesota as a child. She attended the University of Minnesota, where she earned an undergraduate degree and a medical degree. Potter interned in Minneapolis, pursued additional postgraduate study in Vienna, and then entered private medical practice in Minnesota for five years. She earned a Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in 1934. Career After earning her Ph.D., Potter moved to Chicago. She was a pathology instructor in the obstetrics and gynecology department at the University of Chicago. Potter stayed at the university until her retirement. The school was affiliated with the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, where Potter served as a pathologist. When a Chicago health department administrator began to consider the causes of infant mortality in the city, he decided to require autopsies in order for parents to obtain burial permits. In a period of more than 30 years, Potter performed more than 10,000 autopsies on infants. In 1940, Potter co-wrote Fetal and Neonatal Death with her department chair, Fred Lyman Adair; the pair analyzed the causes of death of more than 500 infants who had died in the 1930s. They found that hypoxia and intracranial hemorrhage, which were associated with long labors and difficult deliveries, were two leading causes of death. As she gained more experience with autopsies, Potter felt that identifying abnormalities in individual infants was only a small part of her work. She said that a larger goal was to correlate the findings of specific infants with those of groups of other infants, integrating physical findings with other potential etiologic factors to identify patterns and causes of infant death. Potter became well known for her work establishing Rh disease as an important cause of infant death. She also published a 1946 paper that tied renal agenesis to specific facial findings in a group of 20 babies. Several years later, it was established that bilateral renal agenesis resulted in oligohydramnios, and that the low levels of amniotic fluid caused fetal compression and the observed facial features. The process became known as Potter sequence. In the summer of 1944, Potter married architectural sculptor Alvin Meyer, who had one daughter. Meyer served as the illustrator for one of Potter's books, Fundamentals of Human Reproduction (1948). Potter received an honorary doctorate from the University of Brazil; she had served for a year as a guest lecturer there. The University of South Florida later awarded her an honorary Doctor of Science. Later life Potter retired in the mid-1960s and she moved to Fort Myers, Florida, with Meyer. Meyer died in 1976. Potter later married Frank Deats, an architectural coordinator and watercolorist. Deats predeceased Potter in 1983. After her retirement from medicine, Potter became interested in horticulture, especially the cultivation of indoor plants. In particular, Potter grew bromeliads, and she donated 122 cultivars to the University of Minnesota in 1980 to establish the Meyer-Deats Conservatory at the school's arboretum. The conservatory was named in honor of Potter's husbands.Dr. Edith Potter. Journal of the Bromeliad Society 31 (2):81. March–April 1981. Retrieved January 10, 2016. Potter was diagnosed with colon cancer late in life and she died while on a 1993 cruise in the Caribbean. An endowed professorship at Florida Gulf Coast University was established in Potter's name.

Since 1990, she has lived in Germany. Life Hisku was born on 20 June 1957 in Tirana, then the capital of the Communist People's Republic of Albania. As the daughter of the opera singer Fiqrete Hisku, she began singing at a very young age, like her older sister and younger brother. As a child, Alida Hisku won several singing competitions. She studied in the \\"Jordan Misja\\" Artistic Lyceum in Tirana. At the age of 13, she debuted in the National Song Festival () organized by the Albanian National Television (RTSh), then one of the few and the most prestigious. She ranked second with the song \\"Portret\\" (Portrait) composed by Agim Krajka, which made her known throughout the country. Her major success came in the competitions of 1974, with the song \\"Vajzat e fshatit tim\\" (Girls from my village), and 1975, with the song \\"Buka e duarve tona\\" (Bread from our own hands), where she ranked first and won in both cases. She won other prizes during the competitions of 1976, 1979, 1980 and 1981, collecting a total of five second places, making her one of the top Albanian singers of the time. During this period, she toured various European countries with Albanian artistic tour groups. Her singing career was halted in 1982, when she was arrested by the Sigurimi with the pretence of committing \\"agitation and propaganda against the government\\", while being a member of the Party of Labour of Albania, the Central Committee of the BRPSh, and studying in the political V.I. Lenin Higher Party Institution. The compromising evidence was a brief comment in her personal diary, mentioning the harsh living conditions of the cooperatives workers in the provinces. The diary was read, stolen, and handed over to the authorities. The long interrogation period and the risk of persecution and retaliation towards family and friends of a suspected political \\"enemy\\" led to her divorce from her husband, with Hisku obtaining custody of their two sons later through difficulties. Nevertheless, she was not imprisoned. With the beginning of the fall of communism in Albania, in 1990, she fled with her two children to Germany, where she applied for political asylum. She remarried in Germany, and gave birth to a daughter. In 2005, after 25 years, she returned for the first time to the Albanian singing scene on a show of an Albanian TV station where she sang a few songs and was voted the best singer of the 1970s.

The Enviro400 MMC is produced at Alexander Dennis' Falkirk and Scarborough factories in the United Kingdom. The Enviro400 MMC is available as a complete integral bus – including an alternative styling, the Enviro400 City – or as a bus bodywork on BYD, Scania and Volvo chassis. A tri- axle variant, known as the Enviro400 XLB, is also produced. The Enviro400 MMC is available powered by either Euro VI diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), hybrid-electric or fully-electric powertrains.  Introduction  The Enviro400 MMC can trace its design roots back to 1997, with the introduction of the Dennis Trident 2, one of the first low-floor double-decker buses to enter service. The model saw immense success at the turn of the millennium, despite financial difficulties facing Dennis Specialist Vehicles during this period. As a result of these, production of the Trident 2 passed first to TransBus International in 2001 and then to Alexander Dennis in 2004. Alexander Dennis updated the basic Trident 2 chassis to launch the classic Enviro400 in 2005 – the basic chassis of which was initially still badged internally as a Trident. A second-generation Enviro400 was launched in 2009, with facelifted styling and updated chassis design which finally dropped the Trident moniker. The second-generation Enviro400 was overhauled again to create the Enviro400 MMC, which was launched as the classic model's eventual replacement in 2014. Production of the classic Enviro400 ceased in 2018.  Core body designs = Enviro400 MMC = The Enviro400 MMC was unveiled by Alexander Dennis on 1 May 2014, as the eventual successor to the classic Enviro400. Compared to the classic Enviro400, changes included a complete body redesign with new front and rear ends and Euro VI engines as standard. The Oxford Bus Company was the first company to operate the Enviro400 MMC, followed by Go-Ahead, Stagecoach and Reading Buses. The standard Enviro400 MMC is also available as a hybrid- electric integral, or as a body on Volvo B5LH hybrid chassis; examples of the latter are in service with Stagecoach East Scotland and Stagecoach London, while the former has seen widespread adoption with operators across London. The Enviro400 MMC body is also available on Scania chassis, as with the classic Enviro400, although now the updated Scania N250UD model is offered instead of the previous N230UD. Stagecoach became the first customer to operate the Enviro400 MMC on N250UD chassis in 2016, with deliveries to Stagecoach East Kent. = Enviro400 City = In late 2015, Alexander Dennis launched the Enviro400 City, a premium model of the Enviro400 MMC, featuring restyled front and rear ends to match the single-decker Enviro200 MMC and a glass staircase as standard amongst other features. The Enviro400 City was designed to compete with the New Routemaster and Wright SRM designs, and the first examples, with hybrid powertrain, entered service with Arriva London on route 78. Blackpool Transport became the first operator outside London to order the Enviro400 City in January 2016, with diesel variants for the 9 service, to be upgraded to high-specification Palladium standard with the arrival of the new buses.Blackpool to take first single-door Enviro400 City Bus & Coach Professional 22 January 2016 Subsequently, large numbers of diesel Enviro400 City have entered service with Blackpool Transport, Plymouth Citybus and First Glasgow, along with CNG-powered examples on Scania N250UD chassis with First Norfolk & Suffolk for their XL Service and Scania N280UD chassis with First West of England, Nottingham City Transport and Reading Buses. The Enviro400 City is also the body style chosen for the all-electric BYD K10-based model. = Enviro400 XLB = Enviro400XLB operated by Lothian Buses on Airlink The tri-axle Enviro400 XLB was launched in 2019, providing an equivalent option to the Enviro500 for the United Kingdom market. The Enviro400 XLB features essentially the same body style as the standard Enviro400 MMC, but stretched over three axles and fitted onto Volvo B8L chassis. Lothian Buses were the launch customer for the Enviro400 XLB, with an initial order of 42 vehicles for their new Lothian city core routes. These 100-seat vehicles are intended for British and Irish operators who benefit from the Enviro400 XLB's high degree of parts commonality with other Enviro400 MMC variants; the Enviro500 MMC has a different body structure and is intended for international markets where this factor is less important.https://www.alexander-dennis.com/media/news/2018/november/100-seats- for-lothian-in-new-three-axle-adl-enviro400xlb-on-volvo-chassis/ Recently, the Enviro400 XLB has been introduced on the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway, operated by Stagecoach in The Fens, with 12 vehicles.  Powertrain variants = Enviro400H = Arriva London Enviro400H City on route 78 in Shoreditch in December 2015 The first Enviro400H integral hybrid-electric buses entered service in late 2014 in London. The Enviro400H was initially launched with the MMC-style body, although the City-style body was also made available from late 2015; it was first unveiled at the UK Bus & Coach Expo at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham in October 2015. The Enviro400H is also available with Volvo B5LH chassis under the MMC-style body, as ordered in considerable numbers by Stagecoach. = Enviro400 CNG = The Enviro400 CNG was launched in 2017, with the first production example entering service with First West of England in Bristol on a trial basis. The Enviro400 CNG is only available with the City-style body, built onto Scania N280UD compressed natural gas-powered chassis. Subsequently, First West of England placed an order for 21 Enviro400 CNGs, with were subcontracted out to CT Plus Bristol and entered service on Bristol Metrobus pink line m1 in 2019. A further 77 Enviro400 CNGs were ordered in 2019 and entered service in early 2020 on Bristol routes 6, 7, 17, 42, 43, 44, 45, 73, m3 & m3x, T1, Y1 and Y6. The 77 vehicles are based at Lawrence Hill Depot and are branded as Citylines East, Citylines 73, m3 metrobus and South Glos Lynx. 3 of the 77 vehicles are painted in standard First Bus livery and are intended for use as spare vehicles. Nottingham City Transport have been by far the largest customer for the Enviro400 CNG, taking delivery of 118 examples between 2017 and 2019 as part of a major fleet renewal programme. Additional Enviro400 CNGs have entered service with Reading Buses. = Enviro400 EV = National Express West Midlands Enviro400 EV on Route 6 to Solihull, in Birmingham in July 2020 In 2018, Alexander Dennis launched the Enviro400 EV all-electric variant on BYD Auto's K10 chassis, powertrain and batteries. This 10.9 metre long variant is due to enter service in 2019 with Metroline in London and is the second electric bus model from Alexander Dennis, following 2016's launch of the Enviro200 EV, also in partnership with BYD. The chassis, motor and battery are adapted from BYD's integral K10 10.2 metre double-decker (in service with Metroline in London since 2015) which achieves a 303km service range from a 320kWh lithium iron phosphate battery and two 150kW motors. First York have placed the first order for Enviro400 EVs outside of London, with an unconfirmed number due for delivery towards the end of 2019 on York park & ride contract services. Stagecoach Manchester ordered 32 Enviro400 EVs and were delivered in early 2020. Stagecoach Cambridge received two and entered service in February on the Citi 6. National Express West Midlands ordered 29 Enviro400 EVs, with the first 19 arriving in early 2020, and entering service in July 2020. The other 10 are due to arrive at Coventry in the autumn.

She made her debut for the Republic of Ireland women's national football team in May 2012. Club career Khassal playing against Fulham Foundation Ladies As a youngster Khassal travelled from Cowes on the Isle of Wight to train with Portsmouth when she was attending Cowes High School. She was scouted by Arsenal and joined The Gunners on a four-year academy contract in 2006. During the spring of 2010 Khassal was attached to Irish club Benfica. After moving to attend Capilano University, she played in the North American USL W-League with Santa Clarita Blue Heat and Los Angeles Strikers. She was nominated for W-League Rookie of the Season in 2010. She then moved back to Ireland and made a favorable impact at Wexford Youths during the 2011–12 Women's National League season. She went on to clubs Brighton and Hove Albion, Portsmouth and Lewes. Khassal then joined up with Chichester Ladies in the summer of 2016. After a successful first season with Chichester, they gained promotion for the first time in their history to the Womens Premier (South). Cherelle formed a deadly partnership with Charlie Wilson-Blakley and between them 30 goals were scored. Her second season also saw a very good goals return of 18 in all competitions despite injury's plaguing her for most of the year. The team achieved a solid mid-table finish despite being tipped to go back down. A successful FA cup run saw 'Chi' reach the Quarter final stages against Liverpool. The game was played at Oakland's park (Chichester) and saw a record attendance of just over 600 people. The Reds ran out 3-0 winners on the day but Chichester showed a lot of courage and could have gone 1-0 within the first few minutes. International career Khassal played for the Republic of Ireland Under-19 team in their 2010 UEFA Women's U-19 Championship Second qualifying round mini-tournament in Sweden. In May 2012 national coach Susan Ronan gave Khassal a debut senior cap in a 1–0 friendly defeat by Switzerland at Stadion Niedermatten. She also appeared in Ireland's next match, a 1–0 UEFA Women's Euro 2013 qualifying defeat by Wales in Cork. Khassal has been tipped to gain another senior call up for the European Qualifying Group stages but this has yet to materialise.

TBS ordered the pilot under the name The Group in May 2015, and announced a 10-episode order in January 2016. The series premiered on October 31, 2016, on TBS. On September 13, 2017, TBS renewed the series for a third season. However, on June 9, 2018, TBS reversed the renewal and canceled the series with season 3 already written.  Plot  The series follows city journalist Ozzie Graham (Wyatt Cenac), who travels to Beacon, New York to write a piece on a support group called \\"StarCrossed\\", who are survivors of alien encounters. Although skeptical at first, Ozzie realizes the truth of the group's claims when he begins to recall similar experiences. Ozzie eventually quits his job and moves to Beacon to further investigate the town's strange occurrences, as well as resolve issues in his past related to his possible abduction. As the series progresses, Ozzie gradually learns that his employer, Jonathan Walsh, is a reptilian in disguise. Jonathan, who has considered him a friend since he abducted the young Ozzie, explains that the Trinity Federation, an alliance among three races of extra-terrestrials (greys, whites, and reptilians), was sent many years ago to conquer Earth under reptilian leadership. However, in his time on Earth, Jonathan has developed sympathy for humans and wants to expose the truth about the invasion, so he hopes to persuade his alien coworkers and the humans he calls friends to help.

It is a densely-foliaged shrub with leaves which have a hooked tip and with blue to violet flowers. It occurs in South Australia and Western Australia. Without flowers, this species closely resembles Eremophila deserti but that species has 5 stamens and its fruits are a different shape. Description Eremophila fallax is an erect, densely- foliaged, glabrous shrub which usually grows to a height of between . Its leaves are thick, mostly long, wide, narrow elliptic to lance-shaped with a rough surface and a pointed, hooked tip. The flowers are borne singly on a sticky stalk long. There are 5 overlapping green sepals which are lance-shaped to egg-shaped often with a tapering end and long. The sepals often have a lumpy surface and toothed edges. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petals are cream-coloured, sometimes stained reddish purple on the top of the petal tube. The petal tube is glabrous but often lumpy on the outside and the inner edge of some of the petal lobes are covered with long hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from September to October and is followed by fruits which are a narrow oval shaped to almost spherical, have a papery covering and are long. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The type specimen was collected by Chinnock in 1979, about west of Neale Junction. The specific epithet (fallax) is a Latin word meaning \\"deceitful\\" or \\"false\\" referring to the similarity of this species to Eremophila deserti. Distribution and habitat Eremophila fallax occurs in Eucalyptus woodland from the Serpentine Lake Road, south to the Trans-Australian Railway in Western Australia and east to areas near the Flinders Ranges in South Australia. Conservation status Eremophila fallax is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Although the flowers of this eremophila are relatively small, their light colour contrasts with its dark green leaves making it suitable for planting between shrubs with lighter-coloured foliage. It can be propagated from cuttings or by grafting onto Myoporum and will grow in most soils, including heavy clay. It is also very drought tolerant and survives all but the most severe frosts.

On 6 January 2016, he was awarded a PDSA Gold Medal for his anti-poaching work. Amos Mizmba is the owner of K9 Killer.  Breed background  The Belgian Malinois, a working class dog, can be employed for personal protection and scent tracking. They must receive training so they can channel their high energy drive to tasks that their owners have given them. When Belgian Malinois are young, they require a lot of stimuli from their surroundings so that they can get used to them as they grow older. The Belgian Malinois is a Belgian herding breed that originated from a small town in Belgium called Malines. The other name for a Belgian Malinois is the Chien de Berger (Bair-zhai) Belge (Belzh). This lively and energetic breed can be family friendly with the proper training and care. It can suffer from health problems, like most other breeds, including diseases like retinal atrophy, and hip and elbow dysplasia. Because of its energy and intelligence, the breed was enlisted in World War I.  Origins  K9 Killer's lineage can be followed to the Iraq war and the Belgian Police. His father had parents that served for the United States in the Iraq War. His mother was bred from two Belgian police dogs and was entered into an exchange program and sent to South Africa.  Canines duties in Kruger National Park  In Kruger National Park canines are used for tracking and apprehending poachers. This work includes scent detection of firearms and illegal animal parts. Once suspects have been detected in the park, K9 Killer is loaded into a helicopter and flown to a drop off location. As of the last 4 years K9 Killer has led to the arrest of 115 poachers in Kruger National Park. In order for K9 Killer to remain on the scent trails of humans he had to be introduced to the scents of animals in Kruger National Park at a young age. This two-year training program desensitized K9 Killer to the smells of animals. Kruger National Park suffers from rhinoceros poaching every year. Rhinoceros poaching has increased from 13 poached rhinos in 2007 to 1,215 in 2014. K9 Killer and Amos Mzimba have aided in the arrests of more than 115 rhinoceros poachers illegally hunting within the park grounds.  Awards  The PDSA Gold Medal was awarded to K9 Killer in January 2016 for his fight against anti-poaching in South Africa. Through the protection of human and animal life, animals must show dedication to their duties in order to receive the honour.

It is distributed mainly in the autonomous communities of Navarre and the Basque Country, but is present in much of the northern part of the country. It is well adapted to the mountainous terrain and humid climate of the area. It came close to extinction in twentieth century, but is not now at risk.  History  The origins of the Pirenaica are uncertain. In the past it was the predominant cattle breed of northern Spain. A herd book was opened in Gipuzkoa in 1905, the first of its kind in Spain; in 1925 a herd book was opened in Navarre also. However, from about the turn of the twentieth century, large- scale importation of Braunvieh cattle from Switzerland began to threaten the breed; while at first these were pure-bred, they soon began to be cross-bred with the Pirenaica to improve meat and milk yield. In 1912 a census of cattle in Gipuzkoa found about 50,000 head, of which less than 40% were pure-bred Pirenaica stock; the remainder were Braunvieh and Braunvieh-Pirenaica crosses, in roughly equal proportions. In 1954 there were 18,000 head, but by the 1970s the Pirenaica was close to extinction. In 1974 it had disappeared from the Basque Country, with the exception of about 40 head in Gipuzkoa; in Navarre about 1500 head remained, of which about 1000 were in the valley of Aezkoa. In the 1970s the of Navarre began a programme of recovery of the Pirenaica breed. A number of regional breeders' associations were set up; a national federation of these breeders' associations, the , was formed in 1988. At the end of 2014 the total population was recorded as 40,026, of which 34,806 were female and 5,220 were male. Of these, about 50% were in Navarre and 25% in the Basque Country; there were substantial populations in Aragón, Cantabria and Castilla León, and smaller numbers in Catalonia, the Comunitat Valenciana, Extremadura, La Rioja, Madrid and the Principado de Asturias. The Pirenaica is classified among the \\"autochthonous breeds in development\\" by the Ministerio de Agricultura, Alimentación y Medio Ambiente, the Spanish ministry of agriculture, and thus not at risk of extinction.  Use and management  The Pirenaica was formerly a triple-purpose breed, used as a draught animal and for milk and meat production. While breeding selection is now wholly towards meat production, Pirenaica oxen may sometimes be used in the traditional rural sport of arrastre de piedra, or stone-dragging.

Born in Kilmaley, County Clare, Murphy first played competitive hurling in his youth. He first appeared on the Kilmaley team in the mid-1930s before winning a county intermediate championship medal in 1938. Murphy's prowess lead to him being selected for the Clarecastle senior team at a time when the club was allowed to select players from neighbouring areas. As a member of the Clarecastle team he ended up on the losing side in three senior championship finals between 1936 and 1939. A move to Thurles in 1940 saw Murphy join the Thurles Sarsfields team and go on to win three successive county senior championship medals between 1944 and 1946. He ended his career with the Faughs club in Dublin. Success at club level brought Murphy to the attention of the county team selectors. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-five when he was first selected for the Tipperary senior team for the 1943 championship. A mainstay of the team over the following five years, Murphy won his sole All-Ireland in 1945, having earlier claimed a Munster medal. He later played with the Clare senior team before retiring from inter- county hurling after the 1949 championship. Murphy died on 1 January 2018. At the time of his death he was the second oldest living All-Ireland medal winner.

It was built by John Albert I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, between 1559 and 1565, to secure Mecklenburg's border. The fort saw use during the Thirty Years' War and the Napoleonic Wars, and it was decommissioned in 1894. The fort is now in good condition, and it has been a museum since 1953. It is one of the few well-preserved 16th-century flatland forts in Northern Europe. History The Dömitz Fortress was built between 1559 and 1565 on the orders of John Albert I, Duke of Mecklenburg. It was built on the site of an older fort, which had been built in the 13th century. The fort was one of the strongest in the area, and it was able to secure Mecklenburg's border on the Elbe River. The fort was designed by the Italian military engineer Francesco a Bornau, who also designed the fortifications of the Schwerin Palace. The main gate of Dömitz Fortress Like many other examples of military architecture, the fort was designed with functionality rather than aesthetics in mind, and the only part of the structure which is ornate is its main gate, which is built out of sandstone. The gate is decorated with several carved reliefs, including the coats of arms of Mecklenburg and Brandenburg. The following inscription is written on the gate: The fort saw use during the Thirty Years' War, and was burnt during the in 1635. The fort and town were bombarded and occupied by French and Dutch troops during the Napoleonic Wars. After 1705, the fort was also used as a prison and a madhouse. When the Dömitz Fortress was built, it served as a citadel, and the rest of Dömitz was enclosed in walls in the form of a priests cap. The fort was altered a number of times over the centuries. The only original building within the fort is the Kommandantenhaus (Commander's House), since all other structures were demolished and rebuilt at some point. Its main gate was restored between 1851 and 1865. The Dömitz Fortress became obsolete with the unification of the German Empire in 1871, and it was decommissioned by the military in 1894. The fort was used for a number of purposes, until it was decided to restore it for tourism purposes in 1934. The fort was used as an air raid shelter during World War II, and the buildings inside housed refugees in the years following the war. Since 1953, the fort has been a museum, known as Museum Festung Dömitz. It was added to the list of protected landmarks in 1975, and it was restored for a third time between 2001 and 2007, as part of the ERDF-financed Baltic Fort Route project. Throughout the course of restoration, the main gate was cleaned and desalinated, some structural elements were removed and reattached, and measures were taken to reduce action of moisture on the fort. Layout Held Bastion The Dömitz Fortress is a pentagonal bastion fort, having five bastions containing casemates. The bastions are known as: *Cavalier Bastion *Held Bastion *Drache Bastion *Greif Bastion *Burg Bastion It is surrounded by a ditch, a counterscarp, a covertway and a glacis.

In the book, Unger criticizes the doctrine holding that maximization of free trade should be the commanding goal of the worldwide trading regime, contending that this doctrine is misguided. Instead, Unger argues, the goal of an open worldwide trading regime should be reconciled with measures that foster national and regional diversity, deviation, heresy, and experiment in production, markets and economies. Unger further explores how the tradition of marginalism has rendered the discipline of economics incapable of offering deep insight into the problems of trade and of the global division of labor. Reception Francisco Rodríguez wrote a detailed and laudatory review of Free Trade Reimagined for the Journal of Economic Literature. Noting that Unger \\"deliberately eschews\\" the language of economics, Rodriguez describes Unger's project in Free Trade Reimagined as follows: > Unger's critique is directed at the practical case for free trade that is > premised on the theory of comparative advantage. His central contention is > that the model of comparative advantage is too partial, incomplete, and > empirically inaccurate to permit the drawing out of the general broad policy > implications which are commonly attributed to it. Unger's interest is not in > theoretical debates in economics, but rather in the broader process of > formulation of trade policy and the design of the institutions of the world > trading system. Rodriguez identifies and examines the three basic points that make up Unger's central argument: * That trade theory is fundamentally incomplete. * That international competition and political institutions can have significant effect on technological progress. * That the political economy case for free trade is flawed. Rodriguez notes that \\"this is not the first time that someone has come up with a reasonable case for trade protection—indeed ... the literature is filled with this type of argument.\\" But, Rodriguez notes, Unger is less skeptical of state intervention in markets because, unlike many economists, Unger does not view a state's vulnerability to \\"rent-seeking behaviors\\" as given, but sees this vulnerability as variable depending on the power of various groups in a society, the nature of bureaucracy, and the openness of the political process. Rodriguez states that \\"[w]hile many of the basic ideas proposed by Unger make sense, some of the implications that he draws from them appear problematic.\\" But Rodriguez's final assessment of Free Trade Reimagined is a positive one: > Unger's book is valuable because it puts together a set of ideas—some of > them well-known, others new—into a coherent proposal for a different > approach to free trade than the one that today finds overwhelming acceptance > in policy circles and among academic economists. The fact that some of these > ideas had been developed by economists shows that there is not as much > distance as could appear between what Unger is claiming and what our > profession has found. What is novel is the way in which Unger puts together > these distinct observations into a well-thought out case that with practical > relevance for the formation of commercial policy and the design of > international economic institutions. While economists are familiar with the > elements that make up this case, Unger deserves the credit for drawing out > their full implications. Reviewing Free Trade Reimagined for the World Trade Review, Mordechai E. Kreinin praised the book as \\" a bold attempt to question and restructure the theory of comparative advantage and the idea of free trade that springs from it.\\" However, Kreinin identified what he described as a number of \\"questionable propositions\\" in the book. For example, Kreinin concedes that while \\"it is appropriate to challenge the assumption of the Heckscher–Ohlin (H–O) model, one must admit that … the H–O model does explain many real-world phenomena.\\" Kreinin went on to state that \\"[m]any of the arguments in the book are well-known propositions that do not necessarily conflict with the idea of free trade.\\" Kreinin took issue with what he characterized as Unger’s obscurity and unsupported rejection of \\"certain conventional wisdoms.\\" Kreinin concluded that > too much of [Free Trade Reimagined] consists of assertions (rather than > testable hypotheses), without even examples to illustrate them. To buttress > his arguments, I would suggest adding many real world examples. It is indeed > difficult to revolutionize a theory that has been around for many years and > change radically a trading system built on it, by writing one book. It > certainly can’t be done by simply imagining that an alternative system is > superior. Natalie Chen, reviewing Free Trade Reimagined in the Journal of Regional Science, noted that Unger \\"seeks to revise and to rethink some of the main assumptions that inspire the debate between free trade and protectionism, and his book achieves this objective in an admirable way.\\" Chen summed up Unger's main message as being \\"that the debate about free trade cannot be resolved independently of politics.\\" Chen singled out for special praise Unger's argument that \\"the tasks that require repetition should ... be left to machines, allowing workers to specialize in the other tasks that do not require repetition and thus are the ones that will lead to innovation.\\" As Chen notes, \\"[t]his point of view is so accurate that it comes to a surprise that it still remains largely overlooked in the literature and in the debate on free trade.\\" Chen concluded: \\"Overall, [Free Trade Reimagined] is an exceptional contribution, providing an original and innovative perspective to the rethinking of globalization and free trade.\\" References=Sources=  Category:2007 non-fiction books Category:Books about labour Category:Books about globalization Category:Commercial policy Category:Protectionism Category:Critical legal studies Category:English- language books Category:Books by Roberto Mangabeira Unger Category:Free trade Category:Princeton University Press books ","title":"Free Trade Reimagined"},{"id":"49092834","text":"Sulcospira circumstriata is a species of freshwater snail with an operculum, an aquatic gastropod mollusk in the family Pachychilidae.

An additional 87 prisoners died from ill-treatment in captivity. In September 1841, the Nerbudda became shipwrecked off northern Taiwan near Keelung. In March 1842, the Ann became shipwrecked at Da'an harbour. Survivors from both ships—primarily Indian camp followers and lascars—were captured and marched south to the capital of Taiwan Prefecture, where they were imprisoned before being beheaded. Out of the nearly 300 castaways who landed or attempted to land in Taiwan, only 11 survived captivity and execution. The Daoguang Emperor ordered the execution on 14 May 1842, after the Chinese defeat in Zhejiang.  Background  In expanding their trading activities in East Asia, the British East India Company viewed Taiwan (Formosa) as a viable trading post with rich resource potential. The Company lobbied the British government to grant a trade monopoly by first occupying the island. In 1840, British national William Huttmann wrote to Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston that given the strategic and commercial value of the island and the Qing dynasty's benign rule over it, a British warship with less than 1,500 troops could occupy its eastern coast while also developing trade. During the First Opium War, British men-of-war patrolled the Taiwan Strait and the Pescadores.Tsai 2009, p. 66  Shipwrecks = Nerbudda = In early September 1841, the transport ship Nerbudda set sail from Hong Kong to Chusan (Zhoushan).MacPherson 1843, p. 235 It had 274 personnel consisting of 243 Indians, 29 Europeans, and two men from Manila.The Chinese Repository, vol. 11, p. 684 A severe gale dismasted the ship, which drifted towards the northern coast of Taiwan and struck a reef.Ouchterlony 1844, pp. 203–204 All the Europeans, accompanied by three Indians and the two Manila men, left the Nerbudda in a row boat, leaving behind 240 Indians (170 camp followers and 70 lascars). The ship, which was supplied with provisions, lay in smooth water in Keelung bay for five days, during which they prepared rafts. In attempting to land, some drowned in the surf, others were killed by plunderers on shore, and the rest were captured by local authorities who separated them into small parties and marched them to the prefectural capital Taiwan (now Tainan). About 150 are thought to have made it on shore.Bernard & Hall 1847, pp. 237–238 Meanwhile, those in the row boat proceeded along the eastern coast of Taiwan.MacPherson 1843, p. 236 After being adrift for several days, they were descried by the trading schooner Black Swan and taken to Hong Kong.Ouchterlony 1844, p. 205 The Manchu Brigade General Dahonga (達洪阿) and the Han taotai (intendant) Yao Ying (姚瑩) filed a disingenuous report to the Daoguang Emperor, claiming to have sunk the ship from the Keelung fort while defending against a naval attack on 30 September, with 32 enemies killed and 133 captured. In response, the emperor sent rewards to both commanders. However, the battle never occurred and the people they claimed to have slaughtered were the shipwrecked survivors.Tsai 2009, p. 67 Only two ended up surviving (the head and second serangThe Chinese Repository, vol. 11, p. 683) and being sent to Xiamen (then known by its Hokkien pronunciation as Amoy) after the executions the following year. = Ann = In March 1842, the brig Ann set sail from Chusan to Macao. It had 57 personnel consisting of 34 Indian natives, 14 European or American natives, five Chinese, and four Portuguese or Malays. Most were seacunnies or lascars.The Chinese Repository, vol. 12, p. 114 Strong winds drifted the ship on shore and the ebb tide caused it to run aground near Da'an harbour.Polachek 1992, p. 187 The crew commandeered a Chinese junk in an attempt to set out to sea, but a gale disrupted the plan, and were soon captured by armed Chinese. Dahonga and Yao Ying again sent a disingenuous report, claiming that fishing vessels destroyed the ship in self- defence.Gordon 2007, p. 13 Only nine survivors were spared in the executions in August 1842. In 1843, a list of the names of the 57 crewmen and their fate was published in The Chinese Repository: *43 beheaded *2 died in prison *2 died in the wreck *1 escaped *8 set free to Xiamen (six were European or American natives, one an India native, and one from ChinaThe Chinese Repository, vol. 11, p. 685) *1 Chinese retained as an interpreterGordon 2007, p. 11  Rescue attempts  Between 19–27 October 1841, the British sloop Nimrod sailed to Keelung and offered 100 dollars for every Nerbudda survivor. But after finding out they were sent south for imprisonment, Captain Joseph Pearse ordered the bombardment of the harbour and destroyed 27 sets of cannon before returning to Hong Kong. On 8 October 1842, Commander William Nevill of the Serpent left Xiamen for Taiwan (Tainan).The Chinese Repository, vol. 11, p. 627 Captain Henry Ducie Chads of the Cambrian ordered him to inquire about the survivors of both ships \\"under a Flag of Truce\\". By that time, the British were aware that the captives were already executed. Nevill brought a letter from Chads addressed to the Taiwanese governor, requesting the release of the survivors, but reported that his reception was uncourteous and his letter not accepted. They were told that the last survivors were being sent to Fuzhou.The Chinese Repository, vol. 11, p. 628 On 12 October, they returned to Xiamen.The Chinese Repository, vol. 11, p. 629 When the Serpent arrived in Anping, she found 25 survivors of the 26 crew of the transport ship Herculaneum, Captain Stroyan, which left Singapore on 6 September 1842, carrying coals from Calcutta to the British steamers in Chusan, and been thought lost. Unlike the Nerbudda and Ann survivors, Captain Stroyan and his crew were well-treated, albeit because they knew the fate of many of the other wreck victims, in constant fear of their lives. It is possible, depending on the credibility of contemporary newspaper reports, that the Taiwanese authorities largely spared the European survivors, focusing their executions on the Indian (lascar) crew. The contemporary reports of the rescue of the Herculaneum crew refer to 197 total survivors of the Nerbudda and Ann, 30 having died, 157 having been executed, including eight Britons, one of whom was Robert Gully, the son of prize fighter and MP John Gully, and the 10 survivors who were sent to Xiamen. The Serpent arrived in Xiamen with the Herculaneum survivors on 12 October, the survivors of the Nerbudda and Ann not arriving until 25 October, almost two weeks later.Bell's Weekly Messenger, 6 September 1843, p. 144  Execution  Granary where the prisoners were held captive After the Nerbudda survivors were captured, Dahonga and Yao Ying solicited permission from Beijing to execute them as invaders. On 14 May 1842, the Daoguang Emperor released an edict after British forces repulsed the Chinese attempt to recapture Ningbo in Zhejiang province. With regards to the Ann prisoners, he ordered: \\"after acquiring their confessions, only the leaders of the rebellious yi [barbarians] should be imprisoned. The remaining rebellious yi and the 130-odd that were captured last year shall all be immediately executed in order to release our anger and enliven our hearts.\\"Mao 2016, p. 442 On 10 August, the captives were taken two or three miles outside the city walls. Their execution was reported in The Chinese Repository: > All the rest—one hundred and ninety-seven [prisoners]—were placed at small > distances from each other on their knees, their feet in irons and hands > manacled behind their backs, thus waiting for the executioners, who went > round, and with a kind of two-handed sword cut off their heads without being > laid on a block. Afterwards their bodies were all thrown into one grave, and > their heads stuck up in cages on the seashore.The Chinese Repository, vol. > 12, p. 248 87 other prisoners died from ill-treatment while in captivity.Bate 1952, p. 174 Merchant Robert Gully and Captain Frank Denham wrote a journal while they were imprisoned. Gully was executed while Denham survived. On 25 October, one of the freed survivors Mr. Newman received a \\"leaf\\" of Gully's log from a Chinese soldier who said it was obtained from Gully's shirt, which was stripped off him at the hour of execution. It contained his last known diary entry, dated 10 August. The journals of Gully and Denham were published in London in 1844. In 1876, a memoir by Dan Patridge, a survivor of the Ann, was also published in London.  Aftermath  On 23 November 1842, Plenipotentiary Henry Pottinger condemned the massacre of non-combat personnel and demanded that the Taiwanese officials responsible be degraded, punished, and their property confiscated with the amount paid to the British government for compensation to the families of those executed. He stated that he obtained proof the emperor ordered the execution, but that it was due to the Taiwanese authorities falsely reporting that they were a hostile group who attacked the island despite the vessels not being warships and the captured crew not being troops or fighting men.The Chinese Repository, vol. 11, p. 682 The potential repercussions concerned the Qing government who had just concluded peace negotiations in the Treaty of Nanking a few months earlier. On 11 January 1843, the emperor ordered a judicial inquiry into Dahonga and Yao Ying.Polachek 1992, p. 189 The governor of Fujian and Zhejiang, Yiliang (怡良), was dispatched as commissioner to Taiwan (Tainan).Davis 1852, p. 10 After investigation, he reported that both commanders confessed to sending fabricated reports of defending against a naval attack.The Chinese Repository, vol. 12, pp. 501–503 In April 1843, they were recalled to the capital Beijing.Fairbank & Têng 1943, p. 390 After being interrogated, they were imprisoned but released by the emperor on 18 October, having served only 12 days. Later that year, Yao Ying claimed that his actions were done to boost the declining morale of the Qing officialdom and troops.Polachek 1992, p. 190 On 16 December, Dahonga was assigned to a post at Hami, Xinjiang province, while Yao Ying received an appointment in Sichuan province. The British government were not aware of the postings until Hong Kong Governor John Francis Davis informed Foreign Secretary Lord Aberdeen on 11 March 1845. In 1867, 25 years after the executions, an interview was published in which British physician William Maxwell asked an old Chinese clerk in a Tainan hong if he remembered the beheadings. He responded in the affirmative and claimed that on the same day, a heavy thunderstorm formed and lasted for three days, drowning an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 people: \\"I remember that day well, and a black day it was for Formosa ... that was a judgment from Heaven for beheading the Foreigners; but it was done in revenge for your soldiers taking Amoy\\".Mayers et al. 1867, p. 313Thomson 1873, no. 13  Notes  ;Footnotes ;Citations  References  *Bate, H.

In 2012, she won Pilsner Urquell's Master Homebrewer Competition held in San Francisco, where Master Brewer Vaclav Berka said the beer tasted like he was home. After an extensive career with the California State Legislature she began working for PicoBrew, a product development company in Seattle, WA that specializes in automated brewing equipment. In addition to that work, she is a Nationally ranked judge for the Beer Judge Certification Program as well as serving proctoring and grading exams. Shortly after she had heard about winning the AHA 2013 award she quickly accepted her job offer to be part of PicoBrew’s recipe developer and Pink Boots Society which promotes women as beer professionals in the beer industry.  Biography  Born in Germany, Johnson was exposed early as a child to beer and food culture in Europe. Her birth mother Colette, an Irish immigrant, met Johnson’s father who was an African-American soldier stationed in Germany. Colette worked as a (au pair) housemaid in Germany. Colette, pregnant with Johnson, feared religious repercussions returning to her Irish-Catholic family in Ireland. Colette made the decision to put Johnson up for adoption before she returned to Ireland. Johnson had been adopted by Collette’s employers, the Johnsons, at four days old. Johnson’s adoptive parents worked for the U.S Department of Defence which required traveling across Europe. Johnson traveled the world exploring various beer and food cultures which inspired Johnson to start home-brewing when she moved to the United States. Johnson was particularly fascinated with her adoptive mother’s beer stein collection which complemented the thriving European brewing scene. In 1999, Johnson and her friends bought a home-brewing kit while living in Oakland, CA. Johnson experimented with American Lagers, Czech Pils, and American IPAs. Johnson fell in love with home-brewing while her friends viewed home-brewing as a hobby. Johnson’s friends moved to Delaware, but left all the home-brewing equipment with Johnson which allowed her to keep brewing. Johnson continued to brew on her own while also entering various brewing competitions in California. Johnson’s first win came in 2001 when she entered The California State Fair homebrew competition with an American Amber Ale. Just prior to winning the National Homebrewer of the Year Award in 2013, Johnson relocated to Philadelphia where she attempted to reconnect with her birth father. Shortly after, she became very ill. After series of tests, she was diagnosed with Graves’ disease. With a low expectation of winning, Johnson won the National Homebrewer of the Year award in 2013. Shortly thereafter, she moved to Seattle to start a new career for PicoBrew. Johnson stands as PicoBrew’s head brewmaster today.  Professional history  Annie Johnson’s history includes working as an Information Technology Specialist with the Office of Legislative Counsel, State of California, where she spent over seventeen years, ranging from May of 1994 to August of 2011. Following her departure from her position with the State of California, as well as leaving California itself, Johnson became the Director and Brewmaster of PicoBrew, a Seattle based company that produces brewing equipment to make homebrewing easier and more accessible to the common man, as well as producing different recipes that get uploaded to the digital library that the PicoBrew equipment -such as the Zymatic home brewing system- and anyone who owns it has access to. Also following her relocation to Seattle, Johnson started working as the Brewmaster for the Bluebird Microcreamery and Brewer, which is a brewery/ice cream shop that specializes in dessert beers. Respectively, Johnson has been with the companies from January 2014 and August 2016 to present.  Notable accomplishments  * As her first big success in the brewing industry, in 2001 Annie entered in the California State Fair as her first big competition and ended up winning first place with her American Amber Ale. -Later in 2014 she shares her recipes for winning the 2001 California State Fair publicly. * In 2004 Johnson was awarded with the Queen of Beer award. Here she had won four first place categories specifically as best in show. * In 2012 Johnson entered and won the Pilsner Urquell’s Master Homebrewer located in San Francisco, California. * As 2013’s National Homebrewer of the Year, Annie won this prestigious award against the 8,200 beers entered in the competition, with her Lite American Lager and Mow the Dam Lawn brews. * Annie Johnson serves as a national beer judge (link BJCP) and also has contributed many recipes to PicoBrew’s library.

Biography Adam Schröter was born in the Lusatian town of Zittau around 1525. His father, Andreas, was a teacher at the town school, and for sometime also in Freystadt (now Kożuchów). Andreas was Adam's first teacher as well and passed on to him his love of humanism and literature. In order to further his education, Adam Schröter toured university towns in the Holy Roman Empire, passing through Frankfurt an der Oder in 1547 and later also Prague. Schröter entered the University of Cracow in the winter semester of 1552/53. Schröter excelled in Latin poetry. He began his literary career with a small poetic tome titled Elegiam liber unus. Item epigrammatum liber unus, which included poems dedicated to his patron N. Hübner, his father Andreas, and various Silesian friends and protectors, as well as the coronation of Barbara Radziwiłł. The epigrams, which show the influence of Klemens Janicki, name a number of humanists, including Valentin Eck and Anzelm Ephorinus. He published three further tomes of epigrams at the same printing house - that of Łazarz Andrysowicz. His final poetic effort was a description of the salt mine in Wieliczka published in 1553 as Salinarum Vieliciensium jucunda et vera descriptio. The poem combines mythology with Schröter's personal observations of the mine; Schröter's discussions of the origin and properties of salt point to the influence of Paracelsus.Marek Żukow- Karczewski, Pięknem urzeczeni (trzy zapomniane relacje) / Enchanted by beauty (three forgotten relations), \\"Aura\\" (A Monthly for the Protection and Shaping of Human Environment) 1, 1998, p. 17-19. Schröter's poetic efforts were rewarded in 1560 when he was crowned poet laureate of the Holy Roman Empire.Flood, John L., Poets Laureate in the Holy Roman Empire: A Bio- Bibliographical Handbook, vol. 4 (Berlin; New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2006): 1895. By 1569, Schröter was in Käsmark (now Kežmarok), hosted by his patron Olbracht Łaski. In that year, his Latin translations of the De Praeparationibus and Archidoxae of Paracelsus were published in Kraków. Schröter remained in Käsmark until the end of his life; he died around 1572.

Heddon Court Avenue Belmont, originally known as Mount Pleasant, was a house in East Barnet, London, near Cockfosters, that dated back to the sixteenth century. By the end of the nineteenth century it had become Heddon Court and was the home of a preparatory school for boys. The school closed in 1933 and the house was demolished. The site is now occupied by suburban housing. History The estate later known as Mount Pleasant was held in the sixteenth century by a member of the Rolfe family who is mentioned in sources as early as 1406. There were originally two houses on the site, one of which was held early in the seventeenth century by William Howard, son of Lord William Howard.Cass, Frederick Charles. (1885-92) East Barnet. London: Nichols, p. 138. These two houses were converted into one capital messuage called Mount Pleasant, which in 1636 was held by William Greene. During part of 1635 it was tenanted by Elias Ashmole the antiquary. William Greene was succeeded by his eldest daughter Grace, wife of Edward Pecke, and in 1758 Mount Pleasant was the property of William Westbrooke Richardson, who was elected a governor of Barnet Grammar School in the following year. His trustees sold the estate to Sir William Henry Ashhurst, who in 1786 sold it to William Franks. In 1790 it was purchased by William Wroughton who sold it in 1796 to John Henry Warre. At about this time the name of the estate was changed to Belmont, and John Warre's widow sold it early in the nineteenth century to John Kingston of Oakhill. He sold it in 1813 to Thomas Harvey, who died at Belmont in 1819, when it was sold under his will to Mr. Goodhart, from whom it passed shortly after to Job Raikes. He sold it in 1826 to David Bevan who died there in December 1846, a week after suffering injuries during a fire at the house.\\"Died\\", The Evening Chronicle, 28 December 1846, p. 4.

Heddon Court School At some time in the 1920s, Heddon Court School moved to the site from Hampstead. Under headmaster Henry Frampton Stallard in the 1920s, Heddon Court School, like many English preparatory schools, had a strong sporting ethos and when the poet John Betjeman, applied for a job teaching English there, some time after Stallard had left, he had to bluff familiarity with the rules of Cricket in order to get the job. His interview was recalled in his poem \\"Cricket Master\\". According to John Bale and former pupils, Betjeman then began a programme of converting \\"athletes to aesthetes\\" which caused the school's sporting results to \\"plummet\\". In the year he was there he got drunk, participated in pranks and rescued a boy whose leg had got stuck in boards at the bottom of the swimming pool. He found a kindred spirit in the new headmaster John Humphrey \\"Huffy\\" Hope, a Communist who had taught at Eton and also disliked sport. According to one source, he entered the classroom through the window, and lay on the floor to teach \\"to make sure he's got control.\\"The other secret love of John Betjeman's life.

That start ended in a loss, and for the first few months of the season Chen split time between the ichi-gun team and the ni-gun team in Urawa. However, by the summer Chen was back with the ichi-gun team on a permanent basis, and in the push for a Climax Series spot he proved invaluable, finishing the regular season with 14 2/3 consecutive innings pitched without an earned run.

In 2007, 140 000 Filipinos lived in Toronto, accounting for 3% of Toronto’s overall population. According to the study conducted in 2001, 57% of the Filipino community were female.  History  In 2001, 98% of Canadians of Filipino origin were born in the Philippines. Most immigrants of Filipino origin arrived in the past twenty years. In 2001, 53% of Filipino immigrants arrived in Canada between 1991 and 2000, and another 24% arrived between 1981 and 1990. However, only 4% arrived in the 1960s, and less than 1% came to Canada before 1961.  Demographics =Age= People of Filipino origin are more likely than Canada's population to be either children or employed young adults, while Filipino Canadians are less likely to be retirees or seniors. =Educational attainment= Canadian adults of Filipino origin are more likely than the rest of the population to have a university degree. In 2001, 31% of Canadians of Filipino origin aged 15 and over had either a bachelor’s or post-graduate degree. Canadians of Filipino origin with post-secondary qualifications are more likely to hold degrees in highly technical fields. In 2001, people of Filipino origin accounted for 2% of university graduates in Canada. In 2001, studies show that 33% of women of Filipino origin had a university degree, compared to 27% of their male counterparts. = Employment = Most Canadians of Filipino origin are employed. In 2001, 72% of labour force participants of Filipino origin were employed. In the Filipino population, more men than women work outside the home. Canadians of Filipino origin constitute a high proportion of all those employed in both health occupations and in manufacturing. However, their representation was disproportionately low among the areas of management, education, politics, and the social sciences. =Family status= In 2001, 51% of adults in the Filipino community had marriage status. Canadians of Filipino origin are just as likely as the rest of the population to have single-parent status. In 2001, 6% of adults of Filipino origin aged 15 and over were single parents; most of which were women. In the Filipino community, women represented 88% of all single parents in 2001.

In 2001, 81% claimed they were Catholic, while 15% belonged to either a mainline Protestant denomination or another Christian grouping. However, a relatively small proportion of the Filipino community, 3%, reported they had no religious affiliation.  Institutional support = Toronto Public Library = Previous censuses show that Filipinos in Toronto speak Tagalog more often than any other Philippine language, giving primacy to the Tagalog language on Toronto Public Library’s shelves. Though Filipinos are the fourth largest visible minority group in Toronto (2008), the Toronto Public Library’s Tagalog items numbered fewer than 7000 or less than 1 percent of the Toronto Public Library’s entire multilingual collection in 2006. In 2009, the Toronto Public Library had eight branches with Tagalog collections across Toronto. The larger Tagalog collections are found in neighbourhoods where there are more Tagalog speakers. The large collections at Barbara Frum and Malvern are located near the intersection of several areas where many Filipinos live . Based on physical examination of shelves and anecdotal evidence provided by staff at the Toronto Public Library branches with Tagalog collections, Tagalog paperbacks and melodramatic movies are borrowed more often than award-winning novels and films. Tagalog shows dominate Philippine television today, but Hollywood movies are much more popular than locally produced ones. With regard to Philippine music, Filipino singers are just as likely to perform Tagalog songs as English ones, and the titles of the songs they sing in concerts, on TV, and on their CDs reflect this reality. There is a significant demand for Tagalog materials, though Filipinos who most often speak Tagalog at home are not as many as the English-speaking ones. However, Tagalog is not the language spoken or read by most Filipinos. This is especially the case for 63% of Filipinos in Toronto who speak English at home. The Philippines has 8 major languages and almost 500 dialects, but the language of its mass media are limited to English and Tagalog. Traditional Philippine music and dance. = Filipino Centre Toronto = The Toronto Philippine Consulate founded the Filipino Centre. This centre is the meeting place for many Filipinos. A library containing multiple Tagalog collections was their recent establishment. The centre’s free medical clinic aids newcomers to Toronto, while its homework club for students caters to Filipino youth. A Tagalog class us open to Filipino children and Canadians who have interest in learning the language. Guest speakers from Basilica del Santo Niño often visit. The Filipino Singing Idol Contest showcases traditional Filipino music from the Spanish Era, while dance classes are available. The centre offers exercise programs for seniors. = Kababayan Multicultural Centre = The Kababayan Multicultural Centre is a non-profit agency providing settlement services for Filipino newcomers to Toronto. The settlement program is funded by the three levels of the Canadian government: Federal, Province of Ontario and City of Toronto. Its mission is to support newcomer immigrants by providing settlement services, assisting the job application process, and addressing social barriers. Services are offered in English and Tagalog. Status Tagalog is one of the fastest-growing languages in Canada. In the period 2006-2011, Canadians who consider Tagalog their first language at home increased by 64%. Most Canadians of Filipino origin can converse in one of Canada's official languages. In 2001, 99% said they could converse in one or both official languages, while 1% reported they could speak neither English nor French. Most, 93%, could carry on a conversation in English only, while 6% could converse in both English and French and below 1% spoke French only. In 2001, 59% of the Filipino community said that their mother tongue was a non-official language, while 41% said that their mother tongue was English and 1% said that it was French. 60% of the Filipino community considered Tagalog their mother tongue. =Greater Toronto Area= According to the 2011 census, over 70 000 people in Toronto list Tagalog as their mother tongue. Tagalog is in the top 20 mother tongues listed in Toronto's 140 neighbourhoods. In 22 of those neighbourhoods, over 1000 people list it as their mother tongue. Tagalog mother tongue speakers are largely concentrated in neighbourhoods such as Scarborough and North York. = Relations with Canada = According to the Ethnic Diversity Survey of the 2006 Canadian census, most Canadians of Filipino origin feel a strong attachment to Canada. In 2002, 78% of those who reported Filipino origin claimed they had a strong attachment to Canada. At the same time, 89% claimed they had a strong attachment to their ethnic or cultural group. Canadians of Filipino origin are active in Canadian society. In 2002, 73% of eligible voters reported doing so in the 2000 federal election. Also, 41% reported that they participated in an organization such as a sports team or community association. However, one-third of Canadians of Filipino origin reported unfair treatment towards their race, language or accent. Majority (64%) of those who experienced discrimination reported a lack of employment equity due to their race or skin colour, and 69% claimed discrimination occurred in the workplace or job application.

Staged by a Central Intelligence Agency-sponsored Royalist Laotian irregular regiment, Operation Phoutah was a defensive strike against an oncoming offensive from the 50,000 North Vietnamese troops safeguarding the major transshipment point centered on Tchepone, Laos. The Royalist objective was the capture and occupation of Moung Phalane, which was needed to continue staging guerrilla raids on the Trail. In this, Operation Phoutah failed. Overview The Ho Chi Minh Trail was the key to the Second Indochina War. North Vietnam's People's Army of Vietnam depended on that logistics route to defeat South Vietnam. As a result, during 1969 and 1970, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) urged its guerrilla battalions to raid the Trail to disrupt or interdict the supply lines. Eventually, the South Vietnamese launched Operation Lam Son 719 on 8 February 1971 in a failed incursion to cut the Trail. The South Vietnamese failure to sever those lines of communications did not end ground assaults on the Trail.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 289–291.Castle, pp. 107–110.Nalty, p. 6. Background At the end of January 1971, the People's Army of Vietnam captured the town of Moung Phalane from the CIA-sponsored irregular military battalion, Bataillon Guerrier 303 (BG 303). BG 303 retreated westward toward Dong Hene until ordered to reverse their course. To aid them, the rookie Bataillon Guerrier 314 (BG 314) was ordered to attack northeastward from their base at Kengkok. Both guerrilla battalions went on the offensive on 15 February. BG 314 broke up under enemy fire and was withdrawn. BG 303 managed to attack Moung Phalane, only to be repulsed and pursued back to Dong Hene. On 16 March 1971, Battalion Guerrier 303 (BG 303) relieved Battalion Guerrier 301 (BG 301) at Dong Hene. Battalion Guerrier 302 (BG 302) arrived on the 20th. On 23 March, the 540 guerrillas moved out at dawn; an assigned RLA contingent disappeared. The guerrillas force-marched into Moung Phalane, which was devoid of communist troops. Moung Phalane then served as a catchment for GM 33 stragglers from Operation Desert Rat. On 3 April, GM 33 left the GM 30 stragglers in garrison at Moung Phalane, moving to Nong Saphong.Conboy, Morrison, p. 291. To counter this, the PAVN sent portions of six infantry battalions to retake Moung Phalane before the rainy season interfered with communist logistics. To counter this, Savannakhet Unit of the CIA forwarded Bataillon Guerrilla 306 (BG 306) in an eastward truck convoy of reinforcements on 30 April 1971. Ambushed by the communists, BG 306 dispersed under fire. BGs 301 and 302 at Moung Phalane were assaulted by the PAVN for the next three days; the guerrilla battalions suffered heavy losses and withdrew. The oncoming PAVN now threatened the Royalist hold on all Military Region 3. Intelligence evidence received by the CIA said the PAVN objective was the major Royalist airstrip and stronghold at Seno.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 291–292. Operational phase one Operation Phoutah (translation: Grandfather) was thus a defensive operation against an offensive launched by a 50,000 man PAVN Army Corps centered on the Tchepone transshipment point. The counter to this communist attack on Dong Hene was the four battalions of GM 33, BG 313 from GM 30, and a pair each of Royal Lao Army (RLA) M24 Chaffee tanks, M706 Commando armored cars, and 105mm howitzers. There were also infantry detachments scrounged from eight RLA battalions, and a contingent of Commando Raiders. The defense began on 15 May 1971.Conboy, Morrison, p. 292.Castle, p. 108. The RLA scraps were posted as garrison for Dong Hene itself. Two battalions of GM 33 were posted to push eastwards from Dong Hene; the other two were tasked to thrust east from Kengkok. The probing columns promptly came under communist heavy weapons fire. Platoon-sized raids on Dong Hene also began. On 17 May 1971, the RLA vehicles withdrew westward down Route 9. They ran into a PAVN ambush three kilometers out, which disabled both Chaffee tanks and a truck, stopping the convoy in its tracks. The blocked convoy was overrun two hours later. An attack on GM 33 followed. Its commander called for reinforcements from two RLA paratroop battalions west of Dong Hene. When the sky soldiers did not appear, GM 33 began a fighting retreat. Behind them, the PAVN burned Dong Hene before receding back to Moung Phalane for the rainy season. They blew the highway bridge on Route 9 behind them to hinder pursuit. For the next 13 hours, Groupement Mobile 33 carried their gut-shot colonel and 50 other wounded into safety. A day later, GM 33 reclaimed the ruins of Dong Hene. They remained there until mid-July. Operational phase two On 14 July 1971, two battalions of GM 33 moved east from Dong Hene along Route 9. The other two moved out southwards toward Nong Boualao, with the aim of picking up the Se Sangsoy River to return northwards toward the enemy. GM 33 was scheduled to meet at Moung Phalane. GM 30 garrisoned Kengkok and Dong Hene; they were slated to occupy Moung Phalane after its capture. By July's end, GM 33 had been repulsed three times by the PAVN defenses at Moung Phalane and remained stalled outside town. A week into August, GM 33 was relieved by three battalions of GM 30. There was a week's pause before the assault resumed under close air support from AC-130 gunships. With the Royalist battalions at half strength because of casualties, malaria, and desertions, no progress could be made. On 25 September, Bataillon Guerrier 313 (BG 313) arrived to complete GM 30. One last push by the entire GM 30 regiment then failed, and Operation Phoutah ended its defensive offensive. Aftermath Military Region 3 would become a relatively quiet sector until October 1972.Conboy, Morrison, p. 393. NotesReferences * Castle, Timothy N. (1993).

The opposite of clinical empathy is clinical detachment. Detached concern, or clinical detachment, is the ability to distance oneself from the patient in order to serve the patient from an objective standpoint. For physicians to maximize their role as providers, a balance must be developed between clinical detachment and clinical empathy. In 2001, an instrument was created to measure a physician's empathy towards each patient. This tool is called the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy. The 20-item questionnaire was originally developed for administration to medical students and physicians but has extended to dentistry and nursing because it is easy to interpret, administer, and analyze. From a student's first year to their fourth year in medical school, empathy scores on the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (S-version) decrease. Both gender and specialty choice affect empathy scores, favoring women and primary care specialties.  Clinical empathy  Clinical empathy is a main component of the patient-provider relationship. It is seen as a commonly accepted pillar of professionalism for medical students. Empathy involves both cognitive and affective aspects. The cognitive domain revolves around understanding a patient's experiences and being able to understand the world from their point of view. This contrasts the affective aspect of empathy which involves joining in the patient's emotional experiences and feelings, which correlates closer to sympathy. Empathetic physicians share understanding with patients, which serves to benefit the patient in their physical, mental and social well-being. Both a provider's ability to provide empathetic care as well as a perception of this care by the patient are important in diagnosis and treatment. Developing the ability to understand a patient's thoughts and feelings lends itself to a successful medical interview and collaborative treatment. Practicing empathy in a clinical setting leads to greater patient satisfaction, better compliance, and fewer lawsuits.  Clinical detachment  Clinical detachment is a means of providing objective, detached medical care while maintaining enough concern for the patient to offer emotional understanding. A close patient-provider relationship threatens objectivity, therefore a social distance is expected to ensure professionalism. Students in medical school are taught clinical detachment as a protective mechanism for dealing with emotional experiences such as death and dying. Clinical detachment is also a means of dealing with the pressure of making mistakes and medical uncertainty. Suppression and repression of emotions, intellectualization, and humor are mechanisms used to confront distressing situations in order to give an objective assessment. Jefferson Medical College Main Building 132 S. 10th Street, Beyond My Ken, GFDL Measurement  Because empathy is a multi-faceted and complex concept, measurement proves to be difficult. Although there are scales to measure empathy such as the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, developed by Davis, the Emotional Empathy Scale, developed by Mehrabian and Epstein, and the Hogan Empathy Scale, they were not created explicitly to measure physician empathy. The Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy was created at the Center for Research in Medical Education and Health Care (CRMEHC) at Jefferson Medical College to measure patient perceptions of empathy from their provider. Construct validity, criterion-related validity, predictive validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability all provide empirical support for the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy. The scale was originally intended for distribution to medical students and physicians. Since its creation, it has been translated into 53 languages and applied to other medical professions such as dentistry and nursing. Three versions of the scale now exist, one for medical students (S-version), one for health professions (HP-version), and one for health professions students (HPS-version). Results of the 20 item questionnaire provide that higher scores are related to higher levels of empathy in interpersonal care.  Role in medical education  Medical students' first experience with a patient is often with a cadaver in a gross anatomy course. Working intimately with a cadaver during a gross anatomy course captures the essence of the patient-provider relationship. Cadaver dissection is a challenging emotional and mental experience. Involvement, emotional coping, and ability are three themes that develop during the dissection experience. Medical students in a gross anatomy course may experience mixed emotions and variable reactions to cadaver dissection. Students who view their donor as a scientific specimen are less opposed to dissection, whereas students who view their donor as a former living person face greater difficulty with dissection and foster feelings of empathy towards the cadaver. Because of the emotional impact of dissection, students may develop detached concern to cope with these feelings. In western countries, medical education emphasizes a \\"body as first patient\\" philosophy for dissection. This anonymizes cadavers which fosters a different relationship than in eastern countries. Many eastern countries adopt a mindset of donor as \\"first teacher\\". For example, in Thailand, students are encouraged to develop a personal relationship with their donors. The students are instructed to view their donors with the highest honor and view the cadavers as a \\"great teacher\\". This intention allows medical students to form a relationship that is familiar to them, one of a teacher and student, as opposed to approaching their donor as a doctor, a practice that new and unfamiliar to students. Although eastern and western countries handle cadaver relationships differently, it can be generalized that gross anatomy courses offer an opportunity for students to examine their feelings on life, death, and dying. These courses also promote development of coping strategies for stressful situations. Over the course of medical education, males and females differ in their attitudes and execution of empathetic treatment. Students entering people-oriented specialties such as family medicine, general internal medicine, and other primary care specialties have higher scores on the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy, whereas students entering technology- oriented specialties such as pathology, radiology, and anesthesiology score lower on empathy. Female students are more likely to enter people-oriented specialties whereas men are more likely to enter technology-oriented specialties. Female students score higher than male students on the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy across all years of medical school education. Female students also have a greater likelihood than men to disagree with a need for detached concern in order to provide the best medical treatment. Several studies have indicated that clinical empathy may decline in students during medical school, with a change even being observed from the start to the end of first year. If this is the case, there could be negative consequences, as it is feared that a reduction in empathy may affect professionalism and quality of care. While the exact causes of this decline in empathy have not been fully explored, certain studies have put forward theories. The decrease may be due to the medical curriculum which may cause students to develop more of a scientific instead of a holistic approach to medicine. Empathy decline and its reasons: a systematic review of studies with medical students and residents. Academic Medicine, 86(8), 996–1009.). Another reason may be that the prospect of both wanting to perform well and maintain a caring attitude with patients at all times may be overwhelming and cause anxiety in students. Consequently, to counteract this, students may be more likely to prioritise their performance in medical school, rather than maintaining a caring demeanour. Similarly, it has also been suggested that as the pressure to obtain medical knowledge increases throughout medical school, students become more worried about retaining this knowledge alongside having to remain empathetic and caring towards patients. Students are more likely to lose their empathic qualities as compensation to allow them to still feel as though they are capable of learning all of the information they are required to. Furthermore, as students’ progress through medical school, they may be more likely to dehumanise patients to protect themselves from feelings of distress as they encounter increasingly challenging patients. As a result their empathy for patients may suffer.  Maintenance  Many methods have been put forward which aim to maintain the empathy of healthcare students and professionals with varying success. Interventions have included medical humanities and creative arts around a patient narrative, writing interventions including creative writing and blogging, drama, formal communication and inter-personal skills training and problem based learning.

The company produces an eponymous operations platform that allows hotel guests to use an app on their smartphones to request services from hotel management. Guests can use both the ALICE app and SMS on their smartphones to request services such as restaurant reservations, taxi accommodations, room service, maintenance work, and other items and services. ALICE's largest investor is Expedia which led a $9.5 million funding round in 2016 and a $26 million funding round in 2017. History ALICE was founded in 2013 by Justin Effron (CEO), Alexander Shashou (President), and Dmitry Koltunov (CTO). Effron (a former equity analyst at Citigroup) and Shashou (a member of a UK hotelier family and former employee at Goldman Sachs) devised the idea for ALICE while traveling in Southeast Asia and recognizing the communication difficulties different hotel departments commonly experienced. The two spent 9 months researching the hospitality industry, interviewing around 500 hotel managers and employees during that time. This led to the foundation of ALICE in 2013. Koltunov, who previously helped build the back end trading management system for a hedge fund, spearheaded the technological aspects of the platform. The name of the company is an acronym for \\"A Life-Improving Customer Experience.\\" The name also pays homage to the maid character, Alice Nelson, from The Brady Bunch. By 2014, the company counted the Atlantic Hotel in Fort Lauderdale, the Hutton Hotel in Nashville, and the Setai in Miami Beach among their clients. Its first headquarters was located in Union Square, Manhattan. In February 2015, ALICE received $3 million in seed funding from an investment group that included Seamless co-founders Jason Finger, Todd Arky, and Paul Applebaum; Tishman Realty; 645 Ventures; and the founder of Neuehouse. The company had originally sought $750,000 in funding but bumped it up after demand increased. At the time of the announcement, ALICE's clients included Shangri-La's Hotel Jen, The Gansevoort Group, Standard Hotels, Bespoke Hotels, and Sixty Hotel Group. In June 2015, ALICE launched an updated version of the platform with real-time translation technology. The technology allowed guests to communicate with hotel staff via the app regardless of any language barrier. In December 2015, Expedia announced that it had invested in ALICE, but details of the deal remained confidential. The following month, ALICE relocated its headquarters from Union Square to Herald Square. Later in January, ALICE announced that they had received $9.5 million in funding from Expedia. The funding round also featured 645 Ventures, Neuehouse founders, and Laconia. Additional funding came from Expedia in 2017 when it led a $26 million funding round, becoming the company's majority shareholder. In 2017, ALICE also acquired its competitor GoConcierge. In April 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, ALICE developed and released a software called COVID-19 Checklists Software designed to help hoteliers with tools to streamline operations and communications. It tracks progress and provides reports for hoteliers. Products ALICE's primary product is a workflow management system that is used by Front of House and Back of House staff to dispatch, track and execute all requests and communication. The product is used as an organizational tool for hotel management as it provides them with the ability to schedule, record, and recall data on a single platform. It allows multiple hotel departments and systems to communicate directly through the platform while also offering management the ability to monitor the life cycle of any given task. The platform also has a guest services module that allows hotel guests to communicate with hotel staff using either a white-label or ALICE-branded app on their smartphone. The app allows guests to request services and items from hotel staff and has been described as a \\"digital concierge.\\" Room service, maid service, dinner reservations, taxi accommodations, spa reservations, item requests, maintenance service, and more can be scheduled or requested via ALICE's app. The platform also uses web and SMS options to allow for broader communication between guests and staff. A 2015 update to the platform added real-time language translation, as well. The platform works on an SaaS pricing model in which hotels to pay a monthly fee for the service. ALICE is also looking to expand the product into workspaces and residential units given its strength in package management and digital concierge capabilities often utilized in both multifamily real estate in addition to hospitality.

After retiring, he served as the first mayor of the newly incorporated town of Wickliffe, Ohio. His former home, Coulallenby, now serves as the city hall of Wickliffe. He chose the design for Great Lakes ore carriers in 1905 that became the standard for the next 65 years, and was elected to the National Maritime Hall of Fame in 1984. Early life Coulby was January 1, 1865, in Claypole, Lincolnshire, United Kingdom, to Thomas and Jane ( Bugge) Coulby. He was the fourth of seven children, and the fourth of four sons. His father was a farmer, and Coulby worked on the farm. He was educated in the local private school, and was a voracious reader. During his youth, he read about the Great Lakes and became fascinated by them. Coulby left school at the age of 11, and in the summer of 1879 at the age of 14 left home to take up residence in the town of Newark-on-Trent. He won a position (without pay) with the London, Midland and Scottish Railway learning telegraphy. He was an expert at Morse code within three months. The company formally hired him at 12 shillings a week, and sent him to work at a telegraph station in the village of Ilkeston in Derbyshire. A year later, he was transferred to the telegraphy station at Marple, Greater Manchester, and received a raise of four shillings. In 1883, Coulby applied for and won an $800-a-year position with the British Cable Company. After a 26-day voyage about the steamship SS Leonora, Coulby arrived in Santiago de Cuba in Cuba. Two months after arriving in Cuba, Coulby contracted malaria. Unfortunately, because Coulby's salary was being used to defray the cost of his travel, he had to borrow $30 to pay for his treatment. The company did not respond when he sought reimbursement for his medical care. Coulby also found himself clashing repeatedly with a senior telegrapher. In March 1884, Coulby stowed away on the steamer SS Cienfuegos, which was bound for New York City. Still suffering from the after-effects of malaria, he was nursed to health for free by the Sisters of Charity of New York. After two weeks in the hospital, Coulby was well enough to be discharged. Determined to reach the Great Lakes but without any money, Coulby walked more than from New York City to Albany, New York, and then west along the Erie Canal to Buffalo, New York. He then followed lakeshore railroad tracks to Cleveland, Ohio. During his two-week journey, he did odd jobs for pay for food, housing, and pocket money. Working for John Hay John Hay, who proved critical in launching Coulby on his career as a shipping magnate. Coulby initially applied for a job as a deckhand aboard the Onoko, the first iron hulled lake freighter and one of the biggest ships on the Great Lakes. Lacking experience, he was rejected. Coulby instead received work pushing wheelbarrows for a construction company. He enrolled in night school, where he learned to use the typewriter and to take shorthand. In the fall, he won a job as a $40-a-month stenographer's job with the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. Amasa Stone, founder of the railroad, had two daughters, and John Hay, President Abraham Lincoln's former private secretary, had married one of them (Clara). Hay and John George Nicolay, another of Lincoln's private secretaries, had been working on a biography of Lincoln since 1874, but by 1884 Hay needed in help in making further progress. Sources differ as to whether Coulby met Hay by chance in the railroad office or whether Coulby answered a newspaper advertisement placed by Hay. But by the end of 1884, Coulby was working for Hay, transcribing notes, taking dictation, and checking facts against the extensive documents and correspondence Hay had amassed. The work left him with a lifelong admiration for Lincoln. With work on the biography largely finished by 1886, Hay decided to move to Washington, D.C. Coulby did not want to leave Cleveland. Hay found him an $1,800-a-year government job as a stenographer, a position would have left Coulby financially secure for the rest of his life. But Coulby was ambitious and the job held no prospect for advancement, so he turned the offer down. Amasa Stone's other daughter, Flora, had married Samuel Mather, heir to the Cleveland Iron Mining Company fortune and (in 1883) founder of the rapidly expanding mining concern Pickands Mather & Co. Hay recommended Coulby to Mather, who hired Coulby as a secretary for $50 a month on April 10, 1886. Shipping career=Pickands Mather= Pickands Mather was shipping iron ore from mines in Minnesota to steel mills all over the Great Lakes. Coulby's fascination with lakes led him to learn all he could about Great Lakes shipping: the type of boats, port facilities, weather, routes, cost, and more. As often as he could, he traveled on ships to learn their idiosyncrasies, problems, and labor issues. Coulby was quick to identify ways in which to cut costs, and ways to expand the company's business at minimal expense. He worked in several areas of the firm, but returned again and again to the Marine Department. He was made a partner in the firm in 1900. Coulby helped plan and participated in the greatest expansion of a Great Lakes shipping fleet ever seen at that time. In 1889, Pickands Mather partner and iron mine owner Jay C. Morse, and others organized the Minnesota Steamship Company to meet their joint shipping needs. Within three years, the firm had a fleet of nine steamers and five barges. In 1892, Pickands Mather purchased the Huron Barge Company, and the following year established a steamship coal fueling business. The firm organized the Interlake Company in 1894, and in 1895 purchased the American Steel Barge Company, which had constructed the largest whaleback shipping fleet on the Great Lakes. In 1897, John D. Rockefeller approached Pickands Mather with a request: Build him a fleet of 12 steamships to carry iron for his Consolidated Iron Mines, Oliver Iron Mining Company, and Minnesota Iron Company. Pickands Mather had an ownership interest in Minnesota Iron, and agreed to build the fleet. Coulby was assigned to oversee the construction of the ships, which were transferred to Rockefeller's nascent Bessemer Steamship Company. When Pickands Mather lost the contract to manage the Minnesota Steamship fleet in 1901, Coulby formed the Mesaba Steamship Company to compete with it. Mesaba Steamship built the large freighters Amasa Stone in 1905 and Samuel Mather 1906, and two others. He also arranged to manage the fleets of the Acme Steamship Co., Peavey Steamship Co., and Provident Steamship Co. By 1903, Coulby had oversight of a fleet of 50 steamships (although only five were directly owned by Pickands Mather). He was also a member of the Dock Managers Association, the employer organization which engaged in collective bargaining with labor unions (such as longshoremen and other workers who loaded and unloaded ship). In early 1903, Coulby assumed the duties of President and Treasurer of Great Lakes Towing Company in addition to his work as managing partner of the Marine Department at Pickands Mather. But on December 29, 1903, he resigned this position to become President and General Manager of the Pittsburgh Steamship Company, the Great Lakes shipping division of U.S. Steel. Under the terms of this agreement, Coulby remained manager of the Marine Department of Pickands Mather. =Pittsburgh Steamship= As head of the largest Great Lakes steamship company in North America, Coubly was a study in contrasts. He wore tailored suits purchased in England and smoked fine cigars. Yet, he also loved to tell stories about his life on the farm and his early weeks in America, aggressively demanded to know how much money his subordinates were making, and liked to walk the wharves to learn about his ships, weather, and navigational hazards. Coulby's tenure as president of the fleet was marked by two major accomplishments. First, he significantly upgraded the fleet to eliminate wooden hulled ships, replacing them with much longer and larger steel-hulled vessels. He ordered the significant redesign of Great Lakes carriers as well, eliminating the curved deck of the whalebacks which allowed for greater access to the hold. This allowed for faster loading and unloading, and less time in port (the most costly part of shipping). He also ordered the crew cabins placed atop the deck at the stern, crew cabins placed atop the forecastle, and a pilothouse atop the forecastle cabins. This freed up space belowdecks for cargo. Coulby's redesign of the Great Lakes ore carrier, first implemented with the construction of the Elbert H. Gary in 1905, became the standard for the next 65 years. He then sold off most of the older, smaller vessels. Ship crews downsized significantly, and skilled sail crews were replaced by deskilled blue-collar workers (such as firemen, oilers, and deck watchmen). Ship captains, whose judgement about a sailor's skills often was critical, now performed far more limited roles and had little input about the makeup of the crew. Second, Coulby significantly reorganized the fleet's management and pressured labor unions for wage and benefit cuts. He moved the company headquarters from Duluth, Minnesota, to Cleveland; appointed a new vice president to supervise operations in Duluth; promoted several mid-level managers; and ordered cuts in managerial pay (sometimes as much as 48 percent). With unionization growing among steamship workers, the Lake Carriers' Association (LCA) proved critical to Coulby in implementing his employment policies. He was elected the LCA Executive Committee on January 22, 1903, and came to dominate the group. Coulby's influence came from his having been manager of the Pickands Mather fleet and Great Lakes Towing (commonly known as the \\"Tug Trust\\"), as president of the largest shipping fleet on the lakes, his company's relationship to U.S. Steel (which shipped far more ore on the lakes than any other company), and his natural aggressiveness and tendency to see himself as a \\"benevolent despot\\". Coulby immediately reorganized the LCA. The group had attempted to form a company union, the Lake Carriers' Beneficial Federation, in 1901, but this effort had failed to stem unionization. In the early months of 1904, Coulby led the LCA in bargaining with the many small unions fighting for membership among ship and dock workers. His strategy was to negotiate incremental givebacks first, then snowball the effort into a major anti-union drive. He convinced the Marine Firemen, Oilers and Water Tenders' Union to accept a small wage cut, agree to the elimination of engineers on barges, and to permit captains to lay off workers if a ship was more than three days in port. Then the LCA forced the International Seamen's Union to agree to drop overtime pay and accept a similar layoff provision. The LCA then refused to bargain with the Marine Cooks and Stewards' Union. The union was unable to win a strike vote, and its members went back to work without a contract (accepting a sharp reduction in pay to just $70 a month). Just weeks before the shipping season began in April, Coulby fired all captains in the Pittsburgh Steamship Company fleet, and forced them to reapply for their jobs (blackballing those who had joined a union). The American Association of Masters and Pilots resisted, demanding a captain' right to join a union and a 13.6 percent wage increase (to $2,250 for a full nine months). Although many members of the LCA initially declined to support Coulby, he told them that U.S. Steel would not charter their ships if they backed down. The owners decided to support Coulby. The union went on strike, but the strike was broken on June 14, 1904, after many union members went back to work without a contract. The union never again attempted to organize ship captains. Coulby then forced his workers to sign yellow-dog contracts in 1905. When the Marine Firemen threatened to strike, Coulby won a pledge from the Lake Seamen's Union and the Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association to provide strikebreakers. The International Longshoremen's Association struck anyway on May 1, but when it received no backing from any other union the strike collapsed. In late November 1905, the Pittsburgh Steamship Company lost 10 vessels (but, amazingly, only 12 crew members) when the Mataafa Storm struck the Great Lakes. Coulby rushed to Duluth to oversee rescue and salvage operations. Coulby responded to the disaster by rapidly building 21 Morgan-class ore freighters: True long freighters which were several feet wider than existing steamships. During the 1906 and 1907 shipping seasons, Coulby quietly allowed the LCA to sign one-year contracts with a wide range of labor unions. During this time, however, iron and coal companies stockpiled large amounts of raw materials. In early 1908, Coulby announced that the Pittsburgh Steamship Co. was implementing the open shop. Engineers were required to sign yellow-dog contracts in which they agreed to their classification as management. Other LCA members went even further, enforcing the blacklist, barring union representatives from company property, and requiring all ship crews to sign oaths affirming they were not members of a labor union (and firing anyone who refused to sign or was caught breaking their oath). The LCA's anti-union effort continued the following year. Coulby helped design the LCA \\"welfare plan\\", which required all crew members to participate in a pension scheme that effectively weeded out union supporters. Several unions struck in May 1909, but the employers hired strikebreaks and the International Longshoremen's Association refused to support the strike. Feelings ran high during the strike. In 1910, union workers cut the ear off a non-union deck hand in Buffalo and mailed the ear and a leater containing a death threat to Coulby. But the unions were largely broken, even though the strike lingered into 1912. When it finally ended, what few union members remained went back to work without a contract. The open shop remained the rule among Great Lakes shipping fleets for decades to come, and unionization rates never recovered. Although some wage increases and improvements in working conditions occurred over the next half century, these were implemented at the discretion of employers because they were seen to be good business practices and not because of worker demands. After 1907, Coulby became an increasingly confident and aggressive manager. He began holding meetings with the captains and managers of the Pittsburg and Pickands Mather fleets, coordinating their efforts and discussing schedules, loading problems, routes, navigational issues, and much more. With labor relations quiescent, the 1910, 1911, and 1912 shipping seasons were uneventful. But in early November 1913, the Great Lakes Storm of 1913 struck. The terrible storm sank 17 ships and more than 250 crewmen lost their lives. But while the Pittsburgh Steamship Co. lost several barges, only two of its large freighters were wrecked and loss of life was almost nonexistent. By the time Coulby retired in 1924, he had expanded the \\"Steel Trust Fleet\\" into the most dominant on the Great Lakes. Under his supervision, the company built 26 freighters and four , and purchased three freighters and six freighters. These ships, known as \\"tin stackers\\" for the silver color of their funnels, were part of a fleet which continued to dominate Great Lakes shipping into the 1970s. =Interlake Steamship Co.= Coulby devoted his full attention to both the Pickands Mather and Pittsburgh Steamship fleets. While cost-cutting and labor issues dominated his activities at Pittsburg Steamship, he focused on expanding the Pickands Mather fleet. To finance the construction of these vessels, Pickands Mather would partner with another firm (usually a coal, iron, or steel firm). The two partners would then create a new shipping company to hold title to the vessels built. A fourth company would manage the ships. In 1906, Coulby formed the Lackawanna Steamship Co., a subsidiary of Pickands Mather, and purchased eight steamships to stock its fleet. Beginning in 1912, Henry Dalton, the president of Pickands Mather, held a meeting of all department heads to discuss the company's business. In Dalton's absence, Coulby chaired these meetings. In May 1913, Coulby orchestrated the merger of a number of smaller independent and subsidiary steamship lines into a new company, the Interlake Steamship Company. Pickands Mather had a 100 percent interest ownership in the new line. The firm, which had started out with just a 13/20th interest in a single wooden ship, now owned a company which had 37 freighters and two barges and was the second-largest shipping fleet on the Great Lakes next to the Pittsburgh Steamship Co. The merger included the Acme Steamship Co., Gilchrist Transportation, the Huron Barge Co., the Lackawanna Steamship Co., the Mesaba Steamship Co., the Provident Steamship Co., and the Standard Steamship Co. Coulby was named president of the new fleet. In 1916, Coulby purchased 13 freighters from the Cleveland Steamship Co., and built its first -foot freighter, the Henry G. Dalton. Another six -foot freighters were built in 1916. These purchases brought the Interlake fleet to 52 ships, the second largest on the Great Lakes. Coulby also became increasingly active in other areas of the company as well. In 1905, Pickands Mather invested in the By-Products Coke Corporation, which distilled coal into coke and a wide range of chemical products. Pickands Mather freighters now began hauling coke to iron foundries throughout the Great Lakes. By-Products merged with the Federal Furnace Company in 1915. In 1920, as the By-Products facilities were aging into obsolescence, Coulby and several other partners and upper-level managers backed a successful buyout of By-Products stock, making the company a wholly owned subsidiary of Pickands Mather. The company then invested heavily in upgrading and refurbishing the company plants, becoming a major manufacturer of coke and chemicals. Management of By-Products was overseen by C.D. Caldwell, who was named president of Pickands Mather's new Interlake Iron Corporation and a partner in the firm in 1929. Personal life West wing of Coulallenby, Harry Coulby's mansion in Wickliffe, Ohio. Throughout his life, Coulby returned to Claypole many times. He had several brothers and sisters living there, and as his income rose he began to make significant donations to local schools, churches, and social institutions there. In 1887, Coulby married Jane Eliza Cottier of the Isle of Man. Their marriage ended in divorce about 1909 or 1910. She died on September 13, 1924, in Cleveland, and used much of the divorce settlement to build a $35,000 mausoleum for herself at the city's Lake View Cemetery. On March 4, 1911, Coulby married May Allen Scott. She had married Dr. Xenophon C. Scott in 1892, and the couple had a son, Kenneth. But the marriage ended in divorce (and he died in 1909). In July 1911, Coulby began construction of a luxurious residence at 28730 Ridge Road in Wickliffe, Ohio. The well-known local architect Frederic William Striebinger designed the Renaissance Revival structure, which sat on of land and was built by Wm. T. Paul's Sons. The $1 million, 16-room, two-story mansion had seven fireplaces (with mantels carved from Italian marble), and a skylight over the entrance designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany. The exterior was covered in an unusual terra cotta imported from Italy and glazed bright white. High Palladian windows admitted extensive natural light to every room on the ground floor. The estate contained formal gardens, a pond, a cow barn, a park, and a gatehouse (now the Wickliffe Police headquarters). Coulby kept the trees on the north side of his property trimmed down so he could see ships sailing on Lake Erie from the master bedroom on the second floor. Finished in 1912, the mansion, called Coulallenby (a portmanteau of \\"Coulby\\" and \\"Allen\\"), is considered a superb example of early 20th century Renaissance Revival architecture,; and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. May Allen Coulby died November 11, 1921, and was buried in Lake View Cemetery. Retirement Harry Coulby retired from his duties at Pickands Mather and Pittsburgh Steamship in 1924. He was succeeded as director of the Marine Department at Pickands Mather by Elton Hoyt II. Coulby remained active in business, particularly in the steel industry. He was a close friend of Price McKinney, co-owner and co-founder of the Corrigan, McKinney & Company iron mining firm and the Corrigan, McKinney Steel Company. Another close friend was Cyrus S. Eaton, the electric and natural gas utility, banking, and steel magnate. It was Coulby who had urged Eaton to get into the steel business, The company had first organized in 1903 as the United Steel Corporation, and changed its name (due to acquisition, merger, and reorganization) to the United Alloy Steel Corporation in 1916. Pickands Mather had invested heavily in United Alloy Steel, and Eaton gained control of the company in 1925. Pickands Mather exerted its influence by having Coulby named chairman of United Alloy's board of directors in April 1926. In collaboration with Eaton, Coulby helped engineer the merger of United Alloy and the Central Steel Company of Massillon, Ohio, into the new Central Alloy Steel Company in July 1926. This merger formed the sixth-largest steel company in the United States. Coulby was then elected a director of the new company in August 1926, and appointed to its important executive committee. Coulby remained active in the business affairs Central Alloy Steel Corporation until his death. The city of Wickliffe incorporated as a village in 1916. Coulby was elected the village's first mayor, and served a single one-year term. In May 1917, Coulby was named to the board of directors of Youngstown Sheet and Tube, the fifth-largest steel manufacturer in the nation. His appointment was due to Pickands Mather's financial interest in the firlm. Pickands Mather's association with Youngstown began in 1923, when it supplied the financing to allow Youngstown to merge with the Sheet and Tube Company of America and the Brier Hill Steel Company. The following year, Pickands Mather began operating the Newport iron mine in Minnesota's Mesabi Range on behalf of Youngstown Sheet and Tube. Coulby was a member of the Union Club, Tavern Club, and Cleveland Country Club (all of Cleveland); the Duquesne Club of Pittsburgh; the Chicago Club of Chicago; and the Kitchigami Club of Duluth. Death St Peter's Church, Claypole. Coulby is buried in the churchyard here. On December 10, 1928, Coulby sailed for the United Kingdom. He spent the holidays visiting his siblings Lucy (of Claypole), William, and Robert (the latter two of Newark-on-Trent). He had given a large donation to rebuild the Claypole village school (which was rededicated during Christmas), and had just announced a $25,000 donation to build a dormitory for nurses at the hospital in Newark-on-Trent. Spending the night in London before embarking on a cruise to the West Indies, Coulby died of natural causes in The Ritz Hotel in London. His sister, Lucy, decided he should be buried in the churchyard of the Church of St Peter. His funeral was held on January 24. Coulby left more than $3.2 million in bequests and donations. His will made major bequests to the village of Claypole, the Claypole village school, and the Church of St Peter in Claypole. The bulk of the estate, however, went to Lakeside Hospital in Cleveland (now University Hospitals Case Medical Center), and to the Cleveland Foundation. One-quarter of the estate went to establish a trust, which gave annual awards to Pickands Mather employees who made significant contributions to the business. The Cleveland Foundation contribution was particularly important. The Great Depression had nearly bankrupted the foundation. But Coulby's $3 million bequest not only saved the foundation but \\"propelled [it] into the ranks of the country's five largest community trusts.\\" Heney Adkins of Grundy, Virginia, sued the Coulby estate in 1930, arguing that his father (named Coulby or Tolby) had abandoned the family to be a Great Lakes seaman when Adkins was an infant. Coulby's friend, Homer H. McKeehan, worked hard to quash the lawsuit and trace Coulby's life history. He later wrote a book about the case. Another 13 individuals, workers on Colby's Wickliffe property, also sued the estate claiming that, as household servants, they were due a year's wages under the terms of the will. A probate court ruled they were groundskeepers, not household staff. Legacy The L.C. Smith Transit Co. built the a whaleback freighter, the Harry Coulby, in 1906 to honor Harry Coulby's shipping expertise and his early adoption of the typewriter as a youth. The vessel was renamed the Finland in 1927. In 1927, the Interlake Steamship Co. built a massive new ore freighter, the Harry Coulby, to honor Coulby's contributions to Pickands Mather and Great Lakes shipping. When finished, the -long Harry Coulby was the third largest ship on the Great Lakes behind the Lemoyne (; built in 1926) and the Carl D. Bradley (; built in 1927). The Harry Coulby remained Interlake's largest ship until the J.L. Mauthe was launched in 1953. Referred to as the \\"Czar of the Great Lakes\\" and the \\"Master of the Lakes\\" during much of his career, Coulby was elected to National Maritime Hall of Fame in 1984.

Sachs worked as a children's librarian at the Brooklyn Public Library while working toward her graduate degree. Career Sachs began focusing on her writing during a leave of absence from her library job in 1954. Unable to sell her first novel, Amy Moves In, she set it aside and moved with her husband and children to San Francisco, California in 1961, taking a job at the Main Library. Sachs found a publisher for her book in 1964. By 1968, she had made enough money from her first four published novels to quit her librarian job and become a full-time writer. Sachs wrote 40 books in total, between 1964 and 2006. Personal life While living in New York, Sachs was active in the political organization American Youth for Democracy, which is where she met her future husband, sculptor Morris Sachs.

Biography Book cover of Sharon Fives years forward, March 2011 Tzvi Avisar was born in Jerusalem. Avisar studied at Goldwater College in Eilat and was an active leader in the Likud Youth. He served in the Israeli Navy as a deputy ship captain. Upon his release from the IDF at the end of 2000, he pursued his academic studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in the Middle East and urban Geography program. During his studies, he landed a job at the Supreme Court's security section. He later formed and headed the intelligence department, which had the function of tracking down and dealing with threats made against Supreme Court judges and providing security during court sessions. From 2001 he served as chairman of the student organization (\\"Social Justice\\") at Hebrew University which protested against the steady mistreatment of disadvantaged communities and welfare budgets cuts that were made in favor of adopting an aggressive capitalistic policy. In conjunction, he actively participated in the university program \\"Public Activists\\", which saw him volunteer in rundown neighborhoods and act as a mentor to children of low socio-economic backgrounds. Tzvi was also a delegate of the Beit Hillel movement for Jewish communities in Moscow and Kursk, Russia, with the intention of strengthening Jewish identity and Zionism among elderly Jews who struggled to lead a Jewish life under Soviet domination. He also participated in the Sadaka-Reut program that seeks to promote dialogue between young Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Avisar served as an Advisor to Minister Eli Aflalo in the Ministry of Immigrant Absorption and adviser to Avi Dichter the Minister of Internal Security in Ehud Olmert’s government. In 2005 he founded SkyTech, a software and consultancy firm in the field of internet content that provides services to government offices and public officials. In November of 2005, after Ariel Sharon announced his decision to leave the Likud and form the Kadima party, Avisar was part of the professional team that ran the election campaign. He also established \\"Yallakadima\\" a very known political website that tracked and studied the events played out in Sharon's party throughout its existence. In 2011, Avisar published the book Sharon, Five Years Forward (Hebrew), which covered the transformation in Sharon's political thinking when he made the decision to establish a new centrist party and the events taking shape after Sharon's debilitating stroke in January 2006. Since 2006, Avisar has been a delegate at the World Zionist Congress. He is actively involved in pro-Israel advocacy and has taken part in advocacy and coexistence missions around the world. Establishment of Over The Rainbow Avisar's decision to establish Over the Rainbow – the Zionist Movement, was born on the backdrop of observing the reality and the recent demographic tendencies of the Jewish people. The decision mainly rested on studies conducted by demographer Sergio DellaPergola from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In a global world, where most Jews do not live in Israel nor have any intention of immigrating to it, Avisar believed that the institutional Zionist Movement should adjust its goals to the present day and be attuned to reality. It means that Zionism can no longer solely be expressed by immigration to Israel or by raising funds to Zionist projects in Israel, but rather by empowering Jewish communities, strengthening their ties to Israel, promoting advocacy for the state of Israel and encouraging them to continue and contribute to their living environment – while advocating collaborations with non-Jewish and even non-Zionist organizations in order to promote dialogue and understanding. A year after its inception, the organization successfully established a foothold in nine countries and four continents, has contested in the elections for the 37th World Zionist Congress held in Jerusalem in October 2015, and won recognition as a faction with twelve representatives and four observers from around the world. Avisar is married to Ayelet and are parents to Yuval, Ron and Alon.

A reported possible synthesis of it involves an elimination reaction from a Dewar benzene derivative. The structure itself can be envisioned as benzene with an internal bridge, and calculations indicate it is somewhat less stable than the open 1,4-didehydrobenzene biradical, the valence isomer in which that bridged bond is broken.  Structure and bonding  Resonance is significant around the perimeter rather than through the middle. Ab initio calculations indicate butalene has a planar geometry and, in keeping with a planar structure with 6 π-electron configuration, is aromatic. Thus, the most significant π bonding interactions involve conjugation around the periphery of the whole six-atom structure, similar to benzene, rather than cross-ring resonance along the bridging bond. Significant resonance around one or the other four-membered ring alone would be a less-stable antiaromatic form, as is seen in cyclobutadiene itself.

She is known for her work to conserve Britain's architectural heritage. Her 1980 memoir of life in a minor country house before the Second World War remains in print, and provides a valuable record of this period. Early life and education Lewis was born in 1909 to an upper-middle-class family. Her father, James Lawrence, was a solicitor from a legal family that included James Bacon, vice-chancellor of the Court of Chancery. Her mother, Kathleen (née Potts), was the daughter of a soldier. Lewis had an elder brother, Bill, and two younger sisters, Barbara and Joyce. She was the niece of Susan Lawrence, an early female Labour MP. Lewis initially lived in a village near Brentwood, Essex; the family moved to a nearby country house, Pilgrims Hall, near Pilgrims Hatch, in 1913. She was educated at home by governesses until the age of seventeen; she then spent a year in Paris at a finishing school run by the Ozanne family, where she became fluent in French. She later gained the qualifications in mathematics and Latin required for university study via a correspondence course. In 1932, she became one of the four founding students of the Courtauld Institute of Art, part of the University of London. She gained BA and MA degrees in art history; \\"The Rise of Neo-Classic Architecture in England\\" was the title of her thesis, which was supervised by James Byam Shaw. Biography and research Alessandro Albani, subject of a book by Lewis On leaving the Courtauld in 1937, her first job was as registrar of the City and Guilds of London Art School in Kennington. During the Second World War she additionally worked as a clerk in her family's Lincoln's Inn law firm, as well as serving as a fire lookout. Lewis published a \\"pioneering article\\" in 1938 on 18th-century British antiquarians Nicholas Revett and James Stuart (nicknamed \\"Athenian\\"), who co- wrote The Antiquities of Athens and Other Monuments of Greece. In 1944, she married Dr David James Lewis, a medical entomologist who researched the insect vectors of tropical diseases such as leishmaniasis and malaria. He was the son of the rector of Shenfield, near her childhood home. The couple did not have children. After her marriage, Lewis's research was always fitted around the travel commitments associated with her husband's work on tropical diseases, which resulted in a wide and eclectic selection of research topics. They moved to the Sudan, where he was posted; there Lesley Lewis worked at the Agricultural Research Institute at Wad Medani as librarian and clerk, studying law by correspondence course in her spare time. She and her husband returned to London in 1955, after Sudan became independent from Britain. She was called to the Bar in 1956, becoming one of the earliest female members of Lincoln's Inn; although she did not practise, her legal training was important to her subsequent conservation work. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, she researched materials in the London Public Record Office and the Vienna archives of the Holy Roman Empire relating to the Jacobite Court-in-Exile in 18th-century Rome of James Francis Edward Stuart, the so-called \\"Old Pretender\\", and British travellers on the Grand Tour. She collated the covert correspondence between Cardinal Alessandro Albani and Horace Mann, the English ambassor to Florence. Her book Connoisseurs and Secret Agents in Eighteenth Century Rome, published in 1961, focuses on the secret relationship between Albani, a Hanoverian sympathiser, and Philipp von Stosch, a Prussian antiquarian and collector who was unmasked as a spy for the British government. The book was well received, and was praised by art historian Brinsley Ford for its \\"judgement in selection\\" and \\"skill in presentation\\". Greenwich Hospital A subsequent area of interest was Georgian funerary monuments in Colonial Jamaica. Lewis's obituary in The Times credits her research with stimulating the formation of the Georgian Society of Jamaica. She also published articles on Georgian architecture, including Greenwich Hospital Chapel by James Stuart and Home House by Robert Adam, the building that formerly housed the Courtauld Institute. Memoir Her memoir, The Private Life of a Country House (1912–1939), recounts her childhood years at Pilgrims Hall, and forms a detailed account of upper-middle-class family life in a small English country house with servants before the Second World War. It first came out in 1980 and has since been reissued five times; the 2011 edition is associated with the National Trust. The Sunday Times describes it as a \\"minor classic\\",Quoted on back cover of Severs D. 18 Folgate Street: The Life of a House in Spitalfields (Random House; 2011) () and a review of the first edition states \\"The charm of this book is that so many of the details of everyday life come alive and the more ordinary, prosaic things take on their true importance ... Reading it is rather like peering through the windows of a long-forgotten doll's house.\\" Her recollections have been quoted by several recent texts;A few examples are The Death of Rural England: A Social History of the Countryside Since 1900 by Alun Howkins (2003), Nanny Knows Best: The History of the British Nanny by Katherine Holden (2013), Country House Society: The Private Lives of England's Upper Class After the First World War by Pamela Horn (2013) and The Country House Servant by Pamela Sambrook (2013) Pamela Sambrook writes that Lewis is \\"particularly successful at retrieving the memory of domestic trivia.\\" Heritage work and later life Lewis joined the Georgian Group in 1938, shortly after its foundation, and served as its chair in 1972–79, remaining on its executive committee until 1981. The organisation campaigns for the preservation of Georgian buildings; since 1971, it has been the official body consulted by the planning authorities of England and Wales on applications relating to all Georgian listed buildings and structures. She also served on various committees of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. She was vice-president of the Royal Archaeological Institute in 1980–81. She served as chair of the Chelsea Society in 1980–87. She was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1964. Her obituarist in The Times called the society her \\"spiritual home.\\" She advised the society on giving financial grants to churches for conservation work, and served as its vice-president in 1980–84. In 2002 she was awarded its Society Medal. She was one of the trustees of Sir John Soane's Museum. David Lewis became increasingly ill during the 1980s; he died in 1986. Lewis retained an active interest in the meetings of the Society of Antiquaries into her mid-nineties. In 2005, she recorded a total of 8 hours of interview for an oral history project of the Museum of London. She died in 2010, aged 100.

The most significant was a bridge over South Road, though this was closed for about 12 months in 2017-2018 due to structural problems; it re-opened in January 2018. Crossing lights for cyclists were added at Goodwood Road and improved at South Terrace. In a number of places, there is an improved shared path where cyclists previously needed to use a parallel street.

The church's clock would be important during this period until it was installed one of better performance on the Real Casa de Correos.Luis Alonso Luengo, (1990), «The clock of the Puerta del Sol», Madrid Its demolition coincided with the Confiscation of Mendizábal that left space for the later expansion that was done for the Puerta del Sol. Archaeological remains of various parts of the church were found beneath it in 2006, during an extension of the Madrid Metro connecting Sol Metro Station with Cercanías Madrid, causing a 6-month delay in construction. The remains were later restored and displayed in Sol Station.Comunidad de Madrid, (2009),«Iglesia del Buen Suceso in the Puerta del Sol (Madrid)», Triptych  History  This building was founded by Pious Bernardino de Obregón, founder of the Hospital of the Buen Suceso in the Villa of Madrid, and married with Catalina de Pareja, (daughter of Antón de Pareja, alcaide of Zambrana y Rute and of María Díez), and granddaughter of Gonzalo de Pareja, married in Baena with Isabel Ramírez (daughter of Francisco Ramírez, Captain General of Granada). The history of this building has been investigated by many scholars: Antonio Palomino, Ponz, Madoz, Mesonero Romanos, and Ramón Gómez de la Serna. The area had been the location of neon sign advertising \\"Tío Pepe\\" between Calle de Alcalá and Carrera de San Jerónimo, and was once occupied by a hospital. There were successive constructions and renovations of the building. Some authors suggest that the Philip II did the design during its stay in Valladolid between 1601 and 1607.E. Villamil, (1928), «La Iglesia del Hospital Real de la Corte o del Buen Suceso», Magazine of Archives, Libraries and Museums, vol. 49, pp:25 Although the idea that Francisco de Mora could be a primary ideador of the first building. = Moving of Hospital to Madrid = Its origin is in a traveling hospital that accompanied the Spanish Court, the Hospital Real de la Corte, which was founded by the Catholic Monarchs in Baza in 1489.Miguel Ángel Castillo Oreja, (2000), \\"La Iglesia del Buen Suceso: A Singular building in the history of Puerta del Sol of Madrid\\", Madrid, nº10, Conferences Cycle The mission of that Hospital was to attend diseases and accidents that had the Courtiers surrounding the King. The emperor Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor it moved definitively to the fledgling city of Madrid, sending build outside the City Walls, next to the Puerta del Sol. Its foundation is confirmed on 1529. in a bull of Pope Clement VII on 28 January 1529, in which after name him Administrator, was recognized to him powers to reform and again issue any pius statutes and licits and honests ordinances not contrary to the Sacred Canons. The hospital is built in the area that was in the eastern part of Puerta del Sol, a space that had been occupied by the old Hermitage and shrine of San Andrés. Other authors mention the existence of a parish of Corpus Christi.Juana Espinos Orlando, (1985), The fiesta of the Corpus Christi in Madrid, Madrid, nº 10, City Council of Madrid) The construction is made with little homogeneity and this feature makes that from the beginning be a building much needed of constant reforms. Its conditioning as sanitary facilities was made slowly and in 1561 the hospital was complete. From an architectural point of view the conditioning of the modest hospital did not have any other particular compared with the eighteen health facilities existing in that time in Madrid. However, being a work under the royal patronage, it was not of the worst equipped. The poor materials used in the construction soon start to sag and this is an excuse for its renovation. = Construction of the church = In 1587 Philip II orders a hospitalary reduction in the villa of Madrid. In 1567 demolished some walls of Carrera de San Jerónimo and were confiscated neighbor houses and that do nothing than consolidate the zone area. The small Church of the Hospital is slowly taking representative functions of city center. On 1590 the foundation of the hospital building show signs of weakness. Philip II entrusts to the Police Board of Madrid to build a new church and nursing in the place of the Royal Hospital, appointing for that to architect Diego Sillero and other officers. Diego Sillero, along with his father, had dedicated to other buildings in the city, although that designs would come from the study of Juan de Herrera.Fernandez Herrera y Maldonado, (1633), Book of the life and wonderful virtues of the Servant of God Bernardino de Obregón Father and founder of the Congregation of the Poor sicks and Author of many other Pious works (...), Madrid Proceed to demolition of the old building. The death of Juan de Herrera, inspirer of the work, cause a delay in the renovation. The reason for the delay were mainly economic, there was a shortage of funds did not allow the cost of a new building.A.G.P. Patrontatos, leg. 6848/1, fols. 84 v. 85 The work remained stopped some years. On 1601 Philip III \\"the Devotional\\" decided to move the Court to Valladolid. Architect Francisco de Mora is the newly elected chief architect of the King. On 1606 the Court returns to Madrid, this event reactivate the construction of the church. The stonework is carried out by Agustín de Argüelles. It is not known if it was the need to attend to the cult, or the new care demands, but the construction was accelerated. The church was completed on September 1611. The altar was placed on 1612 and side chapels were finished on 1628. The first description of the church in the Puerta del Sol is that made Fernández Herrera to describe the Bernadino de Obregón's life: After these other descriptions of several authors as Pedro de la Torre, Ruiz de Altable, among others. The space of the Puerta del Sol of Madrid is divided in 17th century into two: the eastern starring the lonja of the Buen Suceso (that meet the Calle de Alcalá and carrera de San Jerónimo), and the western part occupied by the Monasterio de San Felipe and the lonja (the called \\"mentidero\\"). The wide passage that joined corresponded to the space of the Puerta del Sol. On 1695 is detected that one of the canvases of the church threatens ruin. It chooses to expand at the expense of the lonja, although this entails raise a new façade and modify the dome. In the new façade survives, under a semicircular arch between lintels, the former Doric portal with royal shields. The building had to be adapted to the trapezoidal shape of the plot. The new church was terminated on 1700. = Dos de Mayo Uprising = uprising of May 2 had like protagonist the Puerta del Sol. During the Uprising of 2 May of 1808 the church suffered serious damage to its façade and interior. The struggles that occur against the French troops in the Puerta del Sol seriously affect its structure. Struggles to become the Iglesia del Buen Suceso in a symbol of the Madrilenian resistance. But the years passed after this event and it was not until 1839 would again completely reform under the direction by Narciso Pascual Colomer that aims to design the church to accommodate to the architectural preferences of the time. Previously by Royal Order of December 12, 1832 enacted a new \\"Ordinances for the good order, regime and governance of the Royal Parish Church and Hospital of the Court called Nuestra Señora del Buen Suceso\\", which suppress the Governing Board. = The major reform of the Puerta del Sol (demolition) = Due to the reform of the Puerta del Sol, the February 24, 1854 begins the demolition of the church and the hospital. Of the building remains only a columns that were brought to the Casa de Bruguera, in the Paseo de la Castellana. The Clock it wore the façade and that was reference time of the passersby in the Puerta del Sol went to the Real Casa de Correos and has since become in the Clock of the Governorate (Clock of the Puerta del Sol). The church disappears completely from the Puerta del Sol, in its place is constructed the Grand Hôtel de París, which after in mid-20th century receives the famous \\"Tio Pepe\\" neon sign. = Rediscovery = The renovation work planned its inception on 2005, were found its foundations by surprise on 2006. The surprise was that these remains appear to a meter and a half deep. It was not expected to find remains in such good condition after many works carried out by the Madrid Metro in tunneling during the 1910s. Plans to move the remains to another place of Madrid were not implemented.\\"El País (newspaper)\\", June 8, 2006 Instead they were buried a few meters below the foundations and can be seen in the access corridors from Cercanías de Madrid to the Metro in the Estación de Sol.  New site  Argüelles neighborhood, engraving published in 1868 in El Museo Universal. Current building in Princesa 43. Both were transferred to the then new Argüelles neighborhood (by that time Pozas) on the current site of Princesa 43. In 1868 was inaugurated the new Iglesia del Buen Suceso in calle de Princesa, work by Agustín Ortiz de Villajos. Under Amadeo I \\"the Gentleman king\\", el Buen Suceso become to depend administratively by the General Directorate of the Royal House and Heritage, which imposed the obligation to prepare annual budgets. The Restoration establish for the Patronage new tasks, such as the public and free consultation and cure and the aid in accidents occurred on public roads, while assuming additional functions such as the special hospital for diseases of children and sick Home of Health for sick pensioners. During the Spanish Civil War in full defense of Madrid, the church is closed and the hospital continues functioning. The area is devastated by intense artillery bombardment, and the church is completely in ruins. After the war the building was reconstructed. The Act of March 7, 1940 the Royal Patronage is integrated to the National Heritage with the rest of the former Royals Patronages. The final decline of the hospital is marked by resolution of the Board of Administration of the National Heritage of June 9, 1942, by which it removed the hospital services of el Buen Suceso, which become covered by the Directorate General of Health of the Army of Air, using the same building through a lease. This meant, in fact, the liquidation of the historic Patronage, by depriving of its essential purpose, even if, in law, it has prolonged its existence until today. The religious cult continues until now, thanks to the agreement signed by the National Heritage and the Diocese of Madrid-Alcalá, whereby is ceded the building for the operation of the new parish of the Blessed Corpus Christi in the Iglesia del Buen Suceso. On January 1975 began the demolition of the building that then threatens ruin. The city block, between the streets Princesa, Quintana, Tutor and Buen Suceso was designed by architects Manuel del Río Martínez, Ignacio Ferrero Ruiz-de la Prada and Juan Hernández Ferrero. The action includes a new residential and commercial building with metal façade and a new church to match the building. The new church was opened for worship on 17 April 1982. On October 22, 2006, to commemorate the fourth centenary of the discovery of the image, in a ceremony celebrated by Antonio María Rouco Varela (Cardinal Archbishop of Madrid, José Luis Huéscar Cañizal (episcopal vicar), the Nuestra Señora del Buen Suceso's pastor, Miguel Jimeno, and the Ukrainian Greco-catholic Community's chaplain, Ivan Lypko, is canonically crown the statue of Our Lady of Good Success in the parish.

There are few documents that describe the Iglesia del Buen Suceso, especially in regard to the floor layout. The partial descriptions of its conditioning and some engravings and representations of the time give ideas about its presence. There contemporary descriptions of Herrera Maldonado and Ruiz de Altable. The church's entrance had a lonja. The floor layout was in Greek cross with a very developed chancel and four chapels in the corners of intersection of both arms. The style of the church, by 17th century engravings, had characteristics of the classical Mannerism.

It provides an alternative to traditional disposable incontinence products, which are often bulky and plastic-based. Due to concerns about the environmental impact of disposable products, incontinence underwear is becoming an alternative to pads.Clarke-O’Neill, S., Pettersson, L. Fader, M. (2003) Washable products for women. Nursing Times, 99:(1), pp.57–58. Only recently has the textile technology existed to enable the design and manufacture of reusable products with comparable functionality to a disposable pad or diaper.  Incontinence  It is estimated that 1 in 4 women over the age of 35 experience some level of urinary incontinence, often following childbirth or during menopause. Incontinence is also experienced by approximately 1 in 10 men, commonly related to prostate issues. Incontinence is more prevalent with age, and is commonly experienced by those 65 and over. Due to increased life expectancy and decreased fertility rates, the world population is experiencing a \\"global greying\\", which has contributed to an increase in the global market for incontinence products as there is an increasing proportion of people aged over 65.United Nations. (2013). World Population Ageing 2013. http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/ageing/WorldPopulationAgeing2013.pdf  Fabric incontinence underwear  Fashionable reusable underwear alternatives to pads and diapers have emerged. Some of these new washable products still feature built-in absorbent pads or insertable disposable pads, but some of the players in the market offer consumers options which are increasingly like normal underwear. These companies have developed highly absorbent fabrics that combine several moisture-trapping fabric layers to achieve a similar absorbent result to traditional pads. This new-style incontinence underwear looks and feels like normal underwear so it can be washed and reused, whilst being discrete. This offers the user economic and environmental savings. The use of fabric textiles in these new incontinence products also means that it is now possible to make fashionable incontinence underwear. Incontinence underwear products are generally designed to cater for light bladder leakage (LBL), and as such have lower absorbency capabilities than high absorbency pads and diapers. However, newer incontinence underwear is appearing on the market that caters to moderate needs, and can absorb up to 200 mLs of fluid over the course of a day. Some manufacturers of disposable products are responding to the changing market dynamics by introducing disposable incontinence underwear that gives the appearance of normal fabric underwear. These manufacturers aim to imitate how normal underwear sits on the body, to make the underwear more discreet and comfortable. Examples of this include underwear sold by TENA and Depend (undergarment). These efforts to normalize incontinence products, and provide consumers with more options, shows the industry recognition of the need to reduce the stigma around urinary incontinence, and offer wearers product choices that are more comfortable and less bulky. Products available for those with severe urinary incontinence are still predominantly single use disposable pads. Related types of incontinence products include absorbent pads for chairs or beds, and underwear for children who experience nocturnal enuresis. Market growth The US incontinence market is forecast to reach a value of US$1.6 billion by 2017, driven by an aging population and a gradual breakdown of the taboo surrounding incontinence. These factors will contribute to increased numbers of people needing incontinence products which allow them to continue living their lives whilst experiencing the condition. Globally the market is set to grow by between 4 and 7% per annum.Johnsen, M. (December 15, 2014). Boomers, caregivers aid steady growth. Drug store news. pp. 62 Incontinence underwear manufacturers include Australian-based Night N Day Comfort, Canadian-based Caretex, the UK’s Capatex Care (which make the ‘Kylie’ range), and the US- based Wearever. Companies that make incontinence pads include Kimberly-Clark (Depend and Poise brands), Sweden’s SCA (TENA brand) and Domtar (Attends brand). A new category of fashionable incontinence underwear has also recently emerged. Among these companies are Night N Day Comfort (who modify Australian underwear brand BONDS underwear by sewing-in their incontinence pad), Icon Underwear and Confitex, who in 2015 showed a collection of high-end, pad-free incontinence lingerie on the runway at New Zealand Fashion Week.A recent entrant into this category is Zorbies premium quality washable, reusable incontinence underwear.

He was known for his books aimed at the general public and his promotion of thermal bathing, particularly in the city of Bath. Biography Venner completed his Bachelor of Arts and his Master of Arts degrees respectively in 1595 and 1603 at Oxford's Alban's Hall and went to establish his practice in Bridgwater. He then received in 1613 a Bachelor of Medicine and Doctor of Medicine degree at Oxford with a dispensation for non-attendance at lectures. This kind of exemption was granted for various reasons, sometimes unclear, at Oxford at the turn of the 17th century. After marrying Agnes Jeffrye (died 1634), with whom he had four children, he settled in Bath and by 1630 he enjoyed a rather comfortable life there: the sales of his books and his medical practice flourished, and his three sons went to study medicine at Oxford University although one died before graduating. Tobias Venner died at Bath on 27 March 1660 at the age of 83, outliving all of his children and both wives. He was buried in Bath Abbey, where for many years a monument bore his name. Works From 1620 to 1660, various editions of his Via Recta ad Vitam Longam were published in quarto format in London. In addition to its endorsement of thermal waters at Bath), the book gave advice on hygiene and health as well as pursuing Galen's theory of humorism. Venner explains how working on six \\"non-naturals\\" factors (environment, diet, sleep, exercise, excretion, and the passions of the mind) could affect the balance of the four humours, blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile, and thus enhance one's quality of life and longevity. In regards to obesity, he is credited in Via Recta with being one of the first to refer to it as a societal and individual disease in an English language publication. Tobias Venner also ventures into nutrition, for example by decrying beef and various fishes as indigestible, or by praising potato as delightful and nutritious, as well as providing a recipe for mead. In A briefe and accurate treatise concerning the taking of the fume of tobacco (1621), Venner considers tobacco smoking, that was rising in popularity at that time, as a mean of improving digestion and offsetting the detrimental effects of cold if taken with moderation, although he recommended it should not be taken for pleasure alone nor too often. Indeed, he foresaw the risk for the lungs to become \\"unapt for motion, to the great offence of the heart, and ruine at length of the whole body.\\" Bibliography * Via Recta ad Vitam Longam (1620) * A briefe and accurate treatise concerning the taking of the fume of tobacco (1621) * The baths of Bathe (1628) References Category:17th-century English medical doctors Category:Humorism Category:People from Bath, Somerset Category:1577 births Category:1660 deaths ","title":"Tobias Venner"},{"id":"49095044","text":"Sugar Creek is a stream in the U.S. state of Ohio.

In essence, the clause establishes that an individual cannot be tried for the same offense twice under the same sovereignty. The petitioner claimed that Puerto Rico has a different sovereignty because of its political status while others claimed that it does not, including the respondent, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, and the Solicitor General of the United States.

Whether this substance is an aromatic compound is of interest to researchers. Both the component cyclobutadiene and cyclooctatetraene component rings are antiaromatic, but when fused together the rings counteract each other. Formation Bicyclo[6.2.0]decapentaene can be synthesised in a multistep process from bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-3,7-diene-2,5- dione. This is irradiated with ultraviolet producing a tricyclo decadiendione. This is then reduced to a diol with lithium aluminium hydride. The cis isomer then is converted to a tetraene by adding bromide or mesylate and then stripping it with potassium tert-butoxide. The tricyclodecatetraene has two four carbon rings fused to a hexadiene ring. When this is heated to 100 °C in benzene it converts to bicyclo[6.2.0]decapentaene, losing one bridge to form a cyclooctatetraene ring. Another synthesis starts from octalene. Properties Bicyclo[6.2.0]decapentaene has the appearance of orange-red crystals when solid at −78 °C. In standard conditions it is a liquid red-orange oil. Bicyclo[6.2.0]decapentaene dissolves in pentane. Bicyclo[6.2.0]decapentaene reacts with oxygen in air. When heated to 100 °C it dimerizes by converting to a yellow oil that consists of three eight member unsaturated rings, an isomer of cyclooct[c]octalene. Bicyclo[6.2.0]decapentaene has, on average, a planar structure at room temperature. However, with minimal energy it can adopt a tub shape where opposite sides of the ring are bent up in the same direction. The barrier to being non-planar is very low at 0.6 kcal/mol, so at standard conditions the ring is on average flat. Unlike aromatic compounds, it has alternating bond lengths in the rings. One double bond is in the exclusive part of the four member ring (from carbon 9 to 10) and four double bonds are in the eight-member ring, at positions 1,3,5 and 7. The bridging bond between carbon 1 and 8 is unusually long. This bond has a π bond order of 0.1. It may appear to follow Hückel's rule, but MMP2 calculations predict that it is anti- aromatic, with a resonance energy of -4.0 kcal/mol. By contrast, HF/STO-3g and MNDOC calculations predict that it is slightly aromatic. Bicyclo[6.2.0]decapentaene appears to have both rings acting independently, rather than as an aromatic whole 4n+2 π electron system. Derivatives Bicyclo[6.2.0]decapentaene forms a complex with iron tricarbonyl. This has violet crystals and melts around 74-75 °C. Derivatives are known with side chains attached. One example is 9,10-diphenyl bicyclo[6.2.0]decapentaene.

It is one of the oldest karate organizations in existence. Chairman is Akira Amari. History In early 1930, Kanken Toyama a native, returned to his country of origin to open his first dojo in Tokyo on , named Shūdōkan (修道舘) meaning \\"The Dojo for the Study of the Karate Way\\". When American GHQ announced the martial arts ban in 1945, students of Shūdōkan opened a dojo studio called Kanbukan (韓武舘) to avoid the ban. Attempting to create a more subtle name to disguise the organization, students used the name Kanbukan, which means \\"The Dojo of Martial Arts of Korea\\". The director was a Korean called Geka Yung, while a top student of Toyama called Hiroshi Kinjo was the instructor. He performed partner practice with direct blows using a Bōgu (防具 protector) from Kendo. This is Bōgutsuki karate.Gekkan karatedo magazine 2008.12月刊空手道 特集 錬武会の心と技(2008年12月号): fukushodo In 1951 the ban was relaxed and Kanbukan was renamed Renbukan. In 1954 Renbukan hosted the world's first national karate convention. In 1959, with the purpose to nationally organize Karate, the organization established the All Japan Karatedo Federation (JKF) and made Shūdōkan its overall headquarters.Kanken Toyama (1960) Karatedo Daihoukan 空手道大宝鑑 : tsurusobou The JKF appointed Choko Sai as chairman, Yasuhiro Konishi (Shindo Jinen-ryu) and Hiroshi Kinjo (Kanbukan) as vice- chairmen, Kanken Toyama and Hiroyasu Tamae (Otou-ryu) as Shihan, and Hironori Otsuka (Wado-ryu), Tatsuo Yamada (Nippon Kenpo Karate), Shinkin Gima (Shotokan-ryu), Isamu Tamotsu (Shorinji-ryu) and Tsuyoshi Chitose (Chito-ryu) as officers of JKF. In 1964, JKF made a new united league of the non-contact karate world with JKA (Shotokan), Wado-ryu , Goju-ryu and Shito-ryu. Old JKF handed over the name of JKF (Japan Karate Federation) to the new league and changed its own name to Renbukai. Thereafter, Renbukai became a member of JKF as a group encompassing Bōgutsuki karate (防具付空手). This group also includes Koshiki karate (WKKF 硬式空手), Genwakai (玄和会), IPKF (International Protector Karate Federation 国際防具付空手道連盟), Shoko-ryu and Chito-ryu. Styles The origin of Renbukai is Shūdōkan - a school name called Renbukai-ryu (錬武会流). It had been used in the past, but had no basis of origin. This is because Kanken Toyama said, \\"There is no style in karate (空手に流派無し)\\".Kanken Toyama (1960) Karatedo Daihoukan 空手道大宝鑑 : tsurusobou p18 Toyama defined karate as \\"the martial arts to assume an ethical lesson controlling the offense and defense to protect the body by the karate that established the root in hardness and softness, Yin and Yang, the principle of the breathing, and to prevent an enemy a first priority\\". In addition, dojo of various schools such as Shotokan-ryu, Goju-ryu, Shito-ryu and Shindo Jinen-ryu joined Renbukai since it is a competition group where the various factions of traditional karate can use the protector karate rule.

The current building is from 1899 but the place traces its history back to a pastry café which opened at the site in 1824. History Josty's Pavilion In the late 18th century Frederiksberg became a popular excursion destination for citizens from Copenhagen. Some 30 guest houses and entertainment establishments opened in the area, especially along Allégade, Pile Allé and Frederiksberg Alleé. The place that would later turn into Josty's Pavilion was opened by the Italian sculptor Angostino Taddei in 1813. In 1824, it was taken over by Anton Joss. Born in 1790 in the small village of Aver, Graubünden, Switzerland, he moved to Copenhagen in 1812 where he opened a pastry bakery under the name Josty on Østerbrogade (current No. 24). In 1824, Lord Chamberlain Adam Wilhelm Hauch, a frequent guest of the establishment, arranged for King Frederick VI to grant Josty a license to open a pastry shop at Frederiksberg Gardens. He constructed a new pavilion at his own expense that same year. The buffet in Josty's Pavilion in 1899 When Anton Josty died in 1853 his only son, who was born 1932 and was also named Anton Josty, took over the business, running it until his death in 1899. Under the leadership of Anton Josty, his widow and children replaced the old pavilion with a significantly larger restaurant building. The Josty family owned the place until 1937. Today Present day Josty plays host to celebrations, meetings and other events for up to 320 guests. It also has eight hotel rooms. The restaurant currently serves brunch and a café is operated on the veranda facing the park in the summer time. An à la carte restaurant is expected to open in 2016.

Basa Street, is a historic street located in the old downtown district Iloilo City Proper of Iloilo City, Iloilo, Philippines.The street often referred to as the \\"Escolta of Iloilo\\". It is home to several fine examples of historic luxury American era neoclassical, beaux-arts, and art deco buildings. The street has been famous since the Spanish Era. However, its importance has dwindled and the street has become less maintained; yet there have been efforts to revitalize the street, which include the restoration of the historic buildings along the street and beautification projects. The street's heritage designation by the local government, has been expanded into a zone known as Calle Real Heritage Zone which covers the long stretch of J.M. Basa and the streets and thoroughfares of Aldeguer, Mapa, Ortiz, Muelle Loney (Loney Wharf), Solis, Rizal, Iznart (from Chinese Arch to Iloilo Central Market). History 150px Even during the Spanish Era, this street was the main street of commerce for Iloilo. José Rizal was even impressed by the city during his arrival.http://www.choosephilippines.com/go/heritage-sites/1412/calle-real/ The Royal Street of Iloilo: Calle Real During the early period of American occupation of the Philippines, Calle Real was known as a hub of high-end shopping outlets selling products from Europe. The street was officially renamed in honor of Jose Maria Basa, a Filipino businessman-propagandist who was a compatriot of José Rizal. The street remained popularly known as \\"Calle Real\\". The name would also be later used to refer to the central business district of Iloilo City. The Art-Deco buildings and other structures along the street deteriorated but remained to be a shopping hub of the city. Calle Real as a district consisting of Aldeguer, Guanco and Iznart, J. M. Basa, and Mapa streets was declared an Iloilo City heritage zone by the virtue of Ordinance No. 00-054, also known as the Local Cultural Heritage Conservation Ordinance which established the Iloilo City Cultural Heritage Conservation Council (ICCHC). The National Historical Commission of the Philippines declared Calle Real as a district and a heritage zone in August 8, 2014 with the unveiling of a historical marker outside the Villanueva Building. Its current restoration has been a public-private partnership between the government and the Iloilo Cultural Heritage Foundation, Inc. (ICHFI). Other efforts to revitalize the district include the pedestrianization of Calle Real, burying of utility wires, and minimizing obstructive advertisements. Regarding pedestrianization, experimentations have been done, including closing the road during Sundays, but permanent pedestrianization is still contested.http://www.manilatimes.net/calle-real-pedestrianization-program- hits-snag/86423/ CALLE REAL PEDESTRIANIZATION PROGRAM HITS SNAG Cultural performances are staged to promote Ilonggo heritage and to attract domestic and foreign tourists.http://www.mb.com.ph/calle-real-embodies-iloilos- glorious-past/ Calle Real embodies Iloilo’s glorious past The experimentation ended on March 9, 2014; the Philippine Chamber of Commerce Iloilo wished to make this permanent, citing this opportunity to make walking viable and to take pride in the newly rehabilitated heritage buildings of the street.http://www.thedailyguardian.net/index.php/local-news/40135-permanent- calle-real-pedestrianization-mulled Permanent Calle Real pedestrianization mulled Buildings=Calle Real Proper= Calle Real is noted for its historic buildings, many of which were built between the late 19th century and the early 20th century.

The poem was likely composed c. 1350 in Hainaut. The poem consists of 25,750 lines and is retained in two manuscript copies and was printed in 1841; a critical edition wasn't published until 1940. This edition, by Edmond-René Labande, advanced two ideas about the poem. The first was that it should be dated to the middle of the fourteenth century rather than earlier in that century, and the second that it was written by two poets—the first a very capable writer with a fine sense of humor, the second a much less original one. Plot According to Claassens, the plot \\"is impossible to summarize ... briefly\\". The main character's father, King Ernoul of Nijmegen, travels to the Orient to deliver his brother from Saracen captivity. In the meantime his seneschal, Gaufroi of Friesland, takes Ernoul's place in his bed and on his throne, having betrayed his king to Sultan Rouge- Lion. Ernoul has four sons, all of whom go their various ways to escape the threat of death at the hands of Gaufroi; Baudouin is the youngest of them. At age two he is taken in at the court of the Lord of Sebourc. Baudouin sires 31 (bastard) children, one of them with his patron's daughter. He falls in love with the sister of the Count of Flanders, Blanche, and runs off with her. They intend to travel to the Orient, and this sets off a series of extraordinary adventures. They get married, but by hook and crook Gaufroi manages to capture Blanche, forcing Baudoin to travel alone, having adventures in places like Baghdad and Jerusalem. He is reunited with his family; together they return and are able to defeat Gaufroi. After a winter in Nijmegen Baudouin returns to help the King of Jerusalem fight off the Saracens, and he leaves, this time with his 31 children. Background The poem is closely related to other poems from the Crusade cycle including Les Chétifs and continuations of the 13th-century La conquête de Jérusalem. The poem has historical connections; Baudoin seems to be based on Baldwin II of Jerusalem (d. 1131) and Guy of Lusignan (1150-1194), but his name, \\"de Sebourc\\", derives from a town near Valenciennes. A central tension in the narrative is between Holland and Friesland, a tension unique to Old French poetry but well known from the literature of the Low Countries. Gaufroi is Frisian, and the Frisian town of Leeuwarden falls to him by treachery. The poem comes from Hainault, and since the Counts of Hainault had become the Counts of Holland by 1299 (after the death of John I, Count of Holland), it appears that Hainault had adopted the animosity that existed between Holland and Friesland. Legacy The poem has left no trace in the visual arts, and there are only a few surviving copies. While it exerted little influence on other works, it did, after translation into Middle Dutch, provide a source for names and motifs for the two plays Esmoreit and Gloriant.

Martin Bomber Plant (also known as Air Force Plant 1) was an aircraft manufacturing facility in the central United States, located at Offutt Field, Nebraska, south of Omaha. Adjacent to suburban Bellevue in Sarpy County, the plant was operational during World War II, from 1942 to 1945. Background In 1940, as American involvement in World War II loomed, the U.S. Army Air Corps chose Offutt Field as the site for a new bomber plant that was to be operated by the Glenn L. Martin Company. The plant's construction included a concrete runway, six large hangars, and a aircraft-assembly building. The Glenn L. Martin Company began producing its bombers in January 1942, with the plant reaching full-scale production 8 June 1942. Initially producing B-26 Marauder medium bombers, 1,585 Marauders were built at the Martin-Nebraska bomber plant. The Army Air Forces designated the military personnel assigned to the plant as the 83d Army Air Force Technical Training Detachment, later re-designated as Sq L, Government-Owned Assembly Plant No. 1, WD-101, Army Air Forces Material Command. President Franklin D. Roosevelt toured the plant on 26 April 1943 with Nebraska Governor Dwight Griswold and plant owner Glenn L. Martin. Production switched to B-29 Superfortresses in 1944, and 531 of the Boeing-designed very heavy bombers were produced at the Nebraska site. Among these were the Enola Gay and Bockscar, the aircraft that dropped the first atomic weapons to be used in a military action (against the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan). Both were built and modified (Silverplate) at the base. Paul Tibbets personally selected the Enola Gay from the assembly line. Production ended on 18 September 1945, when the last B-29 rolled out of the assembly building. With the manufacturing plant's closure, custody of the airfield and ground facilities were assumed by the 4131st Army Air Force Base Unit, Air Materiel Command and the building's use continued at Offutt Air Force Base into the 21st century. Demolition Due its proximity to the main runway at Offutt, the building was scheduled to be demolished as a safety risk.

History  The gang was named after the Columbia Point Public Housing Project apartment complex built in 1954 and razed in the 1980s to make way for the mixed income Harbor Point on the Bay apartment community located on the Columbia Point peninsula of the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston. The Columbia Point Housing Project had been reported as one of the most dangerous public housing projects in the United States.\\"Boston War Zone Becomes Public Housing Dream\\", The New York Times, November 23, 1991 In the early 1990s, the CPD was largely run by four families, all of which have descendants among the Targets in this case: the Williams family, the Woods family, the Berry family, and the Funches family. Members of the CPD, then and now, often identified themselves by wearing Major League Baseball clothing and caps depicting the colors and logos of the Pittsburgh Pirates (Black and Gold) and the Philadelphia Phillies (Red and White), with both logos used to identify the \\"Point\\" Columbia Point. In September 28, 1995, Bobby Brown was in Boston to visit friends and family. While in Boston, Bobby Brown and his friend Steven Sealey went to visit a local night club near Orchard Park in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston. A man rumored to be affiliated with the CPD jumped out and shot Sealey three times while he was seated in Whitney Houston's Mercedes-Benz with her husband, Bobby Brown and then ran into the Orchard Park Projects. The CPD expanded its drug trafficking business through southern Massachusetts, establishing strongholds in Brockton and Fall River, Southern New Hampshire, and Southern Maine. In June 2015, 48 members of Columbia Point Dawgs were arrested and charged on gun and drug charges after a two year investigation in which Vincent Lisi, special agent in charge of Bostons FBI office said “It is one of, if not the largest, gang takedowns that we’ve seen in Boston — to arrest the most dangerous subjects out there,”.

One blast went off in a Burger King restaurant outside the mall. The attack occurred near a United Nations (UN) information centre, as well as luxury hotels and foreign embassies. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) confirmed that a Dutch UN official was seriously injured in the attacks. It was reported an armed stand-off took place on the fourth level of the Menara Cakrawala (Skyline Building) on Jalan MH Thamrin. At least eight people—four attackers and four civilians (three Indonesians and an Algerian-Canadian)—were killed, and 23 others were injured due to the attack. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility. Background Though Indonesia is far from the conflicts of the Middle East, the country has experienced several attacks by Islamist militants in the past two decades that have killed hundreds. This was the first major attack in Jakarta since the 2009 Jakarta bombings, which were carried out by Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and killed 7 plus 2 suicide bombers. JI is an al-Qaeda-linked group seeking to unite Indonesia, Malaysia, and the southern Philippines under an Islamic state. Since the 2002 Bali bombings, in which over 200 were killed, Indonesia has stepped up attempts to crack down on violent extremism. A law was enacted by the Indonesian legislature in 2003 in this regard. According to a spokesman for the Indonesian National Police, the police had received information in November 2015 about a warning from ISIL that there would be an attack in Indonesia. In 2015, it was reported by the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict that at least 50 Indonesians had joined the thousands of foreign fighters who have travelled to Syria to fight for extremist groups trying to create an Islamic state there. Attacks Brimob Police officers during the 2016 Jakarta attacks in Sarinah, Jakarta Police post damaged by suicide bomb attack in front of the Sarinah mall On 14 January 2016 at 10:40 a.m. local time, several blasts followed by gunfire were reported to have occurred in Central Jakarta, which is home to many luxury hotels, offices and embassies. According to a spokesman for the Indonesian National Police, the attack involved an unknown number of assailants with grenades and guns. A total of six explosions were counted by news media. The attack targeted a traffic police post at a major intersection, not far from the front doors of a Starbucks coffee shop and a Burger King franchise. The post was heavily damaged by explosions. Although three explosions in Cikini, Slipi, and Kuningan neighbourhoods, near Turkish and Pakistan embassies were reported, the Jakarta police later denied these explosions, as well as attacks in Simatupang and Palmerah, as a hoax. One explosion went off in front of a shopping centre called the Sarinah mall, near the UN office. Footage later emerged purportedly showing two attackers huddling together outside the Starbucks outlet when one of their suicide bombs was activated and they were blown up.

Nguyen Huy An's work is a sedimentation of emotion, memory, and isolation. It seeks to make connections between the darkness of psychology that induces an obsession with memory and pessimistic psyches of human behavior. In his practice, Huy An has his signature way of minimal expression, using dark materials from everyday life associated with memories and personal experiences. They reflect the contemplation of the artist on the position or relation of human power with the outside world, examine and deconstruct the sizes of significant images or concepts with a patient, delicate and meticulous approach. From installations, performance art to paintings and sculptures, Huy An's works are noted with introspective, simple and strong concepts. Nguyen's artworks reflect his intricate poetic journey trying to trace the ways to his thoughts, akin to the endless osmosis of groundwater sources accumulating in a well while the well's surface rests subtly. Life As the son of an artist, Nguyen Huy An grew up expressing himself materially. It was after his introduction to installation and performance that his work took on the strong character it has today, where he explores the dark and quiet spaces of his childhood and brings them out into the light. He graduated from the Fine Art University in 2008. In 2010 Huy An co-founded the performance art collective The Appendix Group (Phu Luc) with artists Vu Duc Toan and Hoang Minh Duc. Work=Paintings= The pond - which appears in every village in the North of Vietnam, which is consolidated and stagnant - is an important allegory of Northern Vietnamese for their profoundness yet self- contained and isolated at the same time. Above and reflecting on the pond is the \\"water-temple\\", where Huy An spent most of his childhood playing around and observing villagers' activities, such as worshipping, festival, and community gatherings. The pond's stagnancy consolidates into minimalist form, stands still as a Buddha figure. =Installations=Hair on the table (2005) The tangled hair is the poetic residue of the middle aged and older Vietnamese women, yet at the same time symbolizes their tottery against daily social pressure. Huy An collected tangled hair, brushed them straight as my grandmother did, then roll them together again, like the gigantic heavy hair ball. The Great Puddle (2009) The Great Puddle was made with carved wooden plate in the shape of a table, filled with ink. It recalls the stagnancy of village's pond, yet here rather as stagnant bureaucracy as the table is also allegory of officers' position in the governmental system. 1120 Footsteps K (2012) In 1120 Footsteps K, Huy An laid paper on the surface of 1120 footsteps of Keangnam Building, the highest building in Vietnam. Then he folded them into a stack of paper. Here he approached its core with its most opposite characteristic: the basic low footstep of the stair. 78 Bridge spans V (2012) In this work, Huy An laid a small tape band on each span of Vĩnh Tuy Bridge, the longest bridge in Vietnam. After 1 month, he collected tapes on 78 spans and arranged them in precise order of the spans. The dust on the tape naturally changed color shades, recorded very slight yet existing difference of geographical length and distance. A Ă Â ... (2014) A Ă Â ... is the collection of 29 alphabetical letters with 6 tones of Vietnamese script, carefully extracted from the propaganda slogans drawn on the walls in villages. This act is a removal of word structure, bringing the letters back to its basic linguistic origin, before they were used to construct a political meaning. Yet the letters still bear their historical traces on their surfaces. The slogans were left as a speech defected statements. Study of The Flunctuation of a Shadow (2014) This piece is inspired by the undeniable significance of Lenin as a political figure in the history of the country and specifically in Hanoi. The large shadow cast by the East- facing Statue of Lenin acts as a direct reference to the influence of this political thinker on the land of Vietnam. Measured during the spring equinox, the shadow exists as an entity out of the interaction between the natural (the sun and the spinning the earth) and the unnatural (the concrete form of the statue). Working with a mathematician to determine the area of Lenin's shadow at different times of the day and consolidated into a mathematical equation, Huy An reflects on the way our logic, ideals and worldviews have always been contained and impacted by natural forces beyond our control. =Performance= Nguyen Huy An's performances are quiet, intense, sometimes gruelling, challenging and can be powerful and memorable. He has performances either solo or with the performance art group Phu Luc (Appendix) in important exhibitions such as Frozen Rain at Nha San Studio, Future of Imagination in Singapore Sounds Of Dust in 943 Studio Kunming, China; LIMDIM in Oslo, Norway, and the unprecedented multi-disciplinary exhibition \\"Skylines with Flying People\\" in Hanoi in 2012.

It was first published in 1599 by Johann Thölde who is likely the book's true author.John Maxson Stillman. \\"Basil Valentine. A Seventeenth Century Hoax.\\" The Popular Science Monthly, 1912. It's presented as a sequence of alchemical operations encoded allegorically in words, to which images have been added. The first Basil Valentine book to discuss the keys is Ein kurtz summarischer Tractat, von dem grossen Stein der Uralten (\\"A Short Summary Tract: Of the great stone of the ancients\\"), 1599. The first part of the book is a discussion of general alchemical principles and advice about the philosopher's stone. The second half of Ein kurtz summarischer Tractat, under the subtitle \\"The Twelve Keys\\", contains twelve short chapters. Each chapter, or \\"key\\", is an allegorical description of one step in the process by which the philosopher's stone may be created. With each step, the symbolic names (Deckname, or code name) used to indicate the critical ingredients are changed, just as the ingredients themselves are transformed. The keys are written in such a fashion as to conceal as well as to illuminate: only a knowledgeable reader or alchemical adept was expected to correctly interpret the veiled language of the allegorical text and its related images. Illustrations The 1599 edition does not include illustrations. Woodcuts appear in the 1602 edition. Revised engravings for all twelve steps appear in Tripus Aureus (\\"Golden Tripod\\"). This 1618 Latin translation by Michael Maier includes three works, the first of which is Basil Valentine's. Since the texts predate the images, the texts should be considered primary.

A physicochemical reading was proposed in the twenty-first century. Chemist and historian Lawrence M. Principe has drawn on knowledge of chrysopoetic symbolism and experimentally tested possible chemical processes and practices which may correspond to several of Basil Valentine's twelve steps. Visually he refers to the 1602 woodcuts. Principe speculates that the twelve keys may involve descriptions of varying types. Some of the early keys may encode descriptions of actual laboratory techniques and observed results. Other keys may be theoretical extrapolations of what could be accomplished: ideas for experiments that had not yet been successfully carried out. The final keys may be descriptions of methods based on other writers' textual precedents. There is evidence that the \\"father of chemistry\\", Robert Boyle, also volatilized gold by following the steps in Basil Valentine's keys. Sir Isaac Newton also seriously studied the writings attributed to 'Basil Valentine'.

In Texas, Dr. Richardson described and named 14 geologic formations, 10 from the Cambrian to Lower Cretaceous ages, and two each of the Paleozoic and Precambrian ages. These contributions to stratigraphy formed the basis of all subsequent stratigraphic work in north and west Texas and southeastern New Mexico. Moreover, they led to the identification and development of areas of great economic importance, despite being 10,000 or more feet underground. Dr. Richardson's work led to authorship of 70 publications related to geology.Richards RW. Memorial to George Burr Richardson. Proceedings Volume of The Geological Society of America Annual Report for 1951 July 1952: 135-140. Early life \\"G.B\\", as George Burr Richardson was known to associates, was born August 21, 1872 in Morrisania, a suburb of New York City. His father, George Wentworth Richardson, was a descendant of Samuel Richardson, who was born in England and immigrated to Woburn, Massachusetts about 1635. Following generations included selectmen in Woburn and Charles Richardson, who was an architect and designed the courthouse in Worcester, Massachusetts, about 1780. \\"G.B.\\"'s grandfather moved to Claremont, New Hampshire, where \\"G.B.\\"'s father was born and lived until he moved to Morrisania.Richards RW. Memorial to George Burr Richardson. Proceedings Volume of The Geological Society of America Annual Report for 1951 July 1952: 135-140. \\"G.B.\\"'s mother, Emma Breck, was a descendant of Edward Breck, who emigrated from England to Boston on the James. Following generations were merchants living in Boston until about 1800, when Emma's grandfather, William Breck, moved to Claremont, New Hampshire. Emma's father, James Breck, moved from Claremont to nearby Newport, New Hampshire, where Emma was born and lived until she married George Wentworth Richardson. One of Emma's great great grandfathers was Samuel Chase (1741-1811), a jurist and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, as well as great grandfather of Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase (1803-1873).Richards RW. Memorial to George Burr Richardson. Proceedings Volume of The Geological Society of America Annual Report for 1951 July 1952: 135-140. Soon after \\"G.B.\\"'s birth, his family moved to Chestnut Hill, Mt. Vernon, in Westchester County, where \\"G.B.\\" grew up with a sister, Chester Parker Richardson and a brother, James Breck Richardson. His father died in 1881, when \\"G.B.\\" was nine years old. \\"G.B.\\" attended public schools and the College of the City of New York. Then, in 1892, he matriculated at Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University, where he helped earn his way by tutoring Latin and working as an Assistant in the Physics Department, and where he was awarded a BS degree magna cum laude in 1895.Richards RW. Memorial to George Burr Richardson. Proceedings Volume of The Geological Society of America Annual Report for 1951 July 1952: 135-140. Career Subsequently, \\"G.B.\\" worked as a chemist at the Warren Paper Mills in Portland, Maine, but by the end of his first winter there, he decided that he wanted the outdoor life of a geologist, rather than the indoor life of a chemist. Harvard professor Dr. Shaler, who was much- admired by \\"G.B.\\", influenced that decision. Thus in June 1896, \\"G.B.\\" began graduate studies at Harvard on a one-year Thayer Scholarship. From July through September, 1896 he worked as a geologic aide to Professor J.B. Woodworth, a member of Professor Shaler's group that was surveying the Triassic coal basin near Richmond, Virginia, where coal and coke had been mined during Colonial days. Following his year of graduate work, \\"G.B.\\" assisted J.A. Taff. From July through November, 1897 he helped Taff with field work in Indian Territory, and from January through June, 1898 he worked in Taff's office in Washington, D.C. In 1898, Harvard first established an MS degree, and it was awarded to \\"G.B.\\" on the basis of his prior graduate studies there.Richards RW. Memorial to George Burr Richardson. Proceedings Volume of The Geological Society of America Annual Report for 1951 July 1952: 135-140. From June through December, 1898 \\"G.B.\\" examined gold prospects in the Stikane District of British Columbia for the Cassiar Central Railway of London. Then, from July through September, 1899 he assisted N.H. Darton with field work in South Dakota. That September he began graduate studies as a Fellow in Geology at Johns Hopkins University. There, he was honored by membership in Phi Beta Kappa and qualified for a PhD after one year, though he was not awarded the degree until June 1901.Richards RW. Memorial to George Burr Richardson. Proceedings Volume of The Geological Society of America Annual Report for 1951 July 1952: 135-140. His dissertation was A Study of the Red Beds of the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming.Richardson GB. The upper red beds of the Black Hills. Journal of Geology 1903;10:700-702. From spring until mid-September, 1900 Richardson worked with a USGS party led by Alfred H. Brooks (after whom Brooks Range in Alaska is named) that explored the Seward Peninsula, Alaska and examined in detail the Ophir Creek, Kojsuktapaga, Topkok, and Solomon River mining districts. Afterwards he spent 10 days working in the Nome area during the peak of gold excitement there.Brooks AH, Richardson GB, Collier AJ. A reconnaissance of the Cape Nome and adjacent gold fields of Seward Peninsula, Alaska, in 1900. In: Reconnaissances in the Cape Nome and Norton Bay regions, Alaska, in 1900. USGS, special publication 1901: 1-180. On October 29, 1900 he was appointed Assistant Geologist by the USGS.Richards RW. Memorial to George Burr Richardson. Proceedings Volume of The Geological Society of America Annual Report for 1951 July 1952: 135-140. Next, Richardson worked under Marius R. Campbell in the coal, gas, and oil-field area of western Pennsylvania. Richardson adopted Campbell's unique field methodology and the two became lifelong friends. Richardson was assigned the Indiana quadrangle, which is about 235 square miles. In two and a half months, he discovered that the so- called (by the Second Pennsylvania Geological Survey)\\"Indiana anticline\\" is a syncline.Richardson GB. The misnamed Indiana anticline, Pennsylvania. Journal of Geology 1903;10:700-702. He did so by combining results of his areal mapping with subsurface data from logs of exploratory wells that coal, gas, and oil operators made available to him. During subsequent \\"office seasons\\" of winter, Richardson prepared the text and illustrations of the Indiana folio, which was published in 1904.Richardson GB. Description of the Indiana quadrangle, Pennsylvania. In: Geologic Atlas, Indiana folio 102, USGS 1904. It was the third folio of the Geologic Atlas of the United States, which was a product of a co-operative program between the Pennsylvania Topographic and Geologic Commission and the Federal Survey. Richardson later completed reports on five other quadrangles in that region: the New Kensington quadrangle (published 1932Richardson GB. Geology and coal, oil and gas resources of the new Kensington quadrangle, Pennsylvania. Bulletin 829, USGS 1932.), the Somerset and Windber quadrangles (published 1935Richardson GB. Description of the Somerset and Windber quadrangles, Pennsylvania. In: Geologic Atlas, Somerset-Windber folio 224, USGS 1935.), the Butler and Zellienople quadrangles (published 1936Richardson GB. Geology and mineral resources of the Butler and Zellienople quadrangles, Pennsylvania. Bulletin 873. USGS 1936). In 1902, from July into October, Richardson did field work in California. There, he, H.R. Johnson, Chester Washburne, and Frank L. Hess assisted J. S. Diller in mapping the areal geology of the Redding quadrangle. In June 1903, Richardson was transferred to the Western Section of Hydrology, to participate in a joint project with the State Mineral Survey of Texas, directed by W. B. Phillips, to determine the prospect of obtaining water from deep wells in state-owned areas of school lands in El Paso and Reeves counties. The area included about 9,000 square miles and a sequence of about 8,500 feet of rocks. Richardson completed the reconnaissance in six months, assisted by a student from the University of Texas, E. H. Elder, half of the time. The report was published in November 1904 as Bulletin 9 of the University of Texas Mineral Survey.Richardson GB. Report of a reconnaissance in trans-Pecos Texas, north of the Texas and Pacific Railway. Mineral Survey, Bulletin 9, University of Texas 1904. It includes Richardson's stratigraphic work mentioned at the beginning of this article. Recognizing the need for additional geological work in the area, Richardson later was authorized to undertake more detailed surveys of the El Paso and Van Horn quadrangles, which were published as folios of the Geologic Atlas of the United States in 1909Richardson GB. Description of the El Paso quadrangle, Texas. In: Geologic Atlas, El Paso folio 166. USGS 1909. and 1914Richardson GB. Description of the Van Horn quadrangle, Texas. In: Geologic Atlas, Van Horn folio 194. USGS 1914. From 1904 into 1907, Richardson worked on geological problems in Utah. Initially, the focus was underground water in the valleys of Utah Lake, Jordan River, Sanpete, and Sevier.Richardson GB. Underground water in the valleys of Utah Lake and Jordan river, Utah. Water Supply Paper 157, USGS 1906.Richardson GB. Underground water in Sanpete and central Sevier valley, Utah. Water Supply Paper 199, USGS 1907. However, in 1906, after the Secretary of the Interior withdrew entry from extensive areas of supposed coal lands in Western States, Richardson's work changed focus to the examination and mapping of coal fields as a basis for classification and valuation of public coal lands. That year, Richardson, assisted by W. D. Neal, Leon J. Pepperburg, and C. D. Parrin, made a detailed reconnaissance of the Book Cliffs coal field, between Grand River, Colorado and Sunnyside, Utah.Richardson GB.

From 1919 to 1932, Richardson was in charge of petroleum and natural gas statistics for the USGS. Also, from 1920 to 1939, he supervised preparation of the oil and gas field maps of California, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, the United States, West Virginia, and Wyoming, all of which were published by the USGS. Success of this work necessitated that Richardson acquire and maintain the confidence and co-operation of al pertinent oil and gas field operators.Richards RW. Memorial to George Burr Richardson. Proceedings Volume of The Geological Society of America Annual Report for 1951 July 1952: 135-140. For several years beginning in 1934, Richardson compiled information for various Congressional committees. Perhaps his most outstanding work in this regard (done in collaboration with Hugh D. Miser and Carl H. Dane) was the chapter Petroleum Reserves, published in 1939 in Energy Resources and National Policy.Petroleum reserves. In: Energy resources and national policy. Report of the Energy resources committee to the National Resource Committee, H. Doc. 160, pp 286-294. Personal life As well as having a rich professional life, George Burr Richardson also had a rich personal life, which, like his professional life, was unobtrusive. On June 23, 1904, \\"G.B.\\" married Irene Dashiell of Columbus, Mississippi. In 1898, Miss Dashiell had come to Washington to be official hostess for her uncle, Judge Charles B. Howry of the U.S. Court of claims. Subsequently, she worked as librarian in the War Department until her marriage to \\"G.B.\\" at the home of her sister in Birmingham, Alabama. After the wedding, Irene delighted in accompanying \\"G.B.\\" on his summer field work, which entailed living in camp, and travelling by horses and covered wagons. She accompanied \\"G.B.\\" for 10 summers until their only child, Alice, was born September 20, 1913.Richards RW. Memorial to George Burr Richardson. Proceedings Volume of The Geological Society of America Annual Report for 1951 July 1952: 135-140. At the time of their 48th wedding anniversary in June, 1948, Dr. Richardson wrote that Mrs. Richardson \\"made my life ideally happy.\\" Mrs. Richardson died January 10, 1949, and Dr. Richardson died three months later on March 18, 1949. He was survived by his brother, his sister, and his one child, Alice, who by then had married Edward Russell True and had two children, Lawrence Dashiell True and Peter Russell True, with a third, Alice Wentworth True, on the way.Richards RW. Memorial to George Burr Richardson. Proceedings Volume of The Geological Society of America Annual Report for 1951 July 1952: 135-140. Dr. Richardson was a member of All Souls Memorial Church (Episcopal), the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the Washington Academy of Sciences, the Geological Society of Washington, Phi Kappa Phi, the Cosmos Club, and the Chevy Chase Club.Richards RW. Memorial to George Burr Richardson. Proceedings Volume of The Geological Society of America Annual Report for 1951 July 1952: 135-140. He was quiet, congenial, and obliging. Without protest, he accepted assignments that involved much drudgery. His reports were factual, non- speculative, and concise. According to co-worker James H. Gardner, he thoroughly enjoyed geological discussions and, during times of field work, he often would lead heated arguments around evening campfires. Any animosity that ensued was readily dissolved by his hearty, appealing chuckle. He was a conscientious worker, universally liked and respected, ever polite and kind. Constance Shanner Evans, statistical clerk under him during World War I wrote, \\"Dr. Richardson always stressed the importance of having an inquiring mind. When I first went into his office he gave me an advanced copy of Logic to read, and every few weeks asked how I was getting along with it. He was always thinking of something new -- ways to improve the work. He was more interested in geology than in statistics. He was a gentleman and a scholar, who thought it a great privilege to work for the government.\\"Richards RW. Memorial to George Burr Richardson. Proceedings Volume of The Geological Society of America Annual Report for 1951 July 1952: 135-140. Other sources of great enjoyment to Dr. Richardson were Shakespeare, poetry, biography, and classical music. Leather-bound volumes of Shakespeare's plays were his main reading material on summer field trips. And Beethoven's concertos provided comfort and pleasure until the week of his death. He was unobtrusively religious and considered entering the ministry when at college. His two trips abroad, seeing art galleries and cathedrals in Europe, provided great joy. Also, he enjoyed golf and loved the great outdoors. In later years he spent nearly every summer on the New England Coast, where he could enjoy both.Richards RW. Memorial to George Burr Richardson.
