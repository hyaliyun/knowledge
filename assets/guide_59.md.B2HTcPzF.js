Martin, sub-treasurer of the Inner Temple, and Susan Abernethy. He was educated at various schools and lastly, the Military school in Enfield his father wanted him to become a soldier with the East India Company. But he was orphaned at 15 years of age, lived with an aunt (Kezia, sister of his mother Susannah Abernethy, and widow of Thomas Mower) who supported his desire to not proceed with military life and leave school to become a carpenter and draughtsman. He had had a hobby of sketching and painting, for several years and now, took part-time instruction at the South Kensington Schools in London but was mostly self-taught in art. He found life in London unpleasant, was restless for a healthier life style and took advantage of the Canadian Government's offer of of land to enable him to immigrate and be a pioneer settler. He married Emma Nichols (1842‚Äì1911)‚Äîthey went on to have nine children. In 1862 they emigrated to Canada and built a small house in Muskoka, Ontario. Farming proved impossible because of the poor quality of the land and so the family moved and settled in Toronto, where Mower Martin soon became an established professional painter. Martin produced landscapes, animals, still lifes and portraits in oils, watercolours and etchings. He was one of a group of artists given passes by the Canadian Pacific Railway to paint landscapes in western Canada‚Äîthey became known as the \\"Railway Painters\\". Earlier he had travelled and painted landscapes through eastern Canada and the United States, and also provided illustrations for two books by A & C Black, Canada and Kew Gardens. He was a founding member of the Ontario Society of Artists in 1872, and charter member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1880, and was also a member of the Royal British Colonial Society of Artists (1909). Mower Martin exhibited widely as an artist during his lifetime and his works can be found in many public and private collections, including Windsor Castle in England. Martin was a member of the Swedenborgian church and wrote philosophical leaflets for the organisation. He died at the age of 96 in 1934.  Illustrated books  *Campbell, Wilfred.

The show featured guest interviews, audience participation and live music. Tonight with Craig Doyle was broadcast every Saturday night during the spring season directly after the main evening news. History=Replacing Tubridy Tonight Following Pat Kenny's stepping down as host of The Late Late Show in 2009, RT√â announced that Ryan Tubridy, host of his own Saturday night chat show, would be Kenny's replacement. Tubridy Tonight had aired since 2004 and had regularly drawn an audience of up to half a million since the first series. The departure of Tubridy to the Friday night slot left a gap in the schedule. In late 2009 RT√â announced that it was to commission a new Saturday night entertainment show that would be fronted by \\"an established name or a combination of established names\\". Miriam O'Callaghan and Gerry Ryan, two broadcasters who lost out in the battle to succeed Kenny as host of The Late Late Show, were two names that were mentioned as possible hosts. It was hoped that the show would be \\"high energy\\", would \\"provide a distinctively Irish take on contemporary entertainment\\" and proposals for the show's format could include \\"chat, music, comedy, satire or some other element, such as audience participation, games, etc\\". It was reported by the Evening Herald that the programme would have a budget of 90,000 per programme while the set for the show cost 100,000, despite being only for an eight-week show and tough company budget cuts. In a new departure RT√â decided to pit two new chat shows against each other. Brendan O'Connor, who moved to RT√â from The Apprentice: You're Fired! on TV3, would present The Saturday Night Show for an initial run of eight weeks before handing over to Doyle who would present Tonight with Craig Doyle for a further eight weeks. Whichever chat show proved successful would be recommissioned for a further series. Doyle was known to have secured the role even before The Saturday Night Show had aired and wanted the Saturday programme to \\"complement\\" the more serious Friday night chat show by being entertaining. Debut Tonight with Craig Doyle made its debut on 10 April 2010 for an initial run of eight programmes. The guests for the first programme were La Toya Jackson, Louis Walsh and actress Victoria Smurfit. Kate Nash was the musical guest and Jarlath Regan provided stand-up comedy. Ending Following the completion of both The Saturday Night Show and Tonight with Craig Doyle it was decided to recommission the former for a second series. It proved more popular with the audience than Doyle's show which was panned by the critics and regarded as a flop. Sinead Ryan of the Evening Herald said that Doyle \\"is the latest contestant in RT√â's version of The Apprentice\\", referring to the different presenters changing around in that slot. Doyle went on to present The Social, a midweek nighttime show on RT√â Two. Production Tonight with Craig Doyle was broadcast from Studio 4 in the RT√â Television Centre at Donnybrook, Dublin 4. That studio is also home to the shows Friday night rival The Late Late Show. As RT√â's biggest the studio holds 200 audience members. The programme was pre-recorded on the Wednesday before broadcast. This was primarily because Doyle had other presenting work to do on ITV Sport.

Career Mannion joined First Division Wolverhampton Wanderers as a youngster, signing professional forms in November 1957. He spent his early professional days in the reserves before finally making his senior debut in the 1958 Charity Shield where Wolves went down 4‚Äì1 at Bolton Wanderers. The 1959‚Äì60 season saw his strongest run of games in a Wolves shirt as he made 10 consecutive appearances in the final run-in. Despite scoring six times in this spell, the club lost out on a third successive league title by a single point to Burnley, denying them a domestic double. He was limited to just 21 appearances in total for the Molineux club, largely due to the presence of Norman Deeley on the wing. With playing opportunities limited, he moved to Norwich City in September 1961, for ¬£13,000. Mannion made 100 league appearances for the Canaries in six and a half years in the Second Division. He scored 17 league goals for the club and played in both legs of their 1962 League Cup triumph. The winger eventually left to join Chester in January 1968 but spent just five months there before dropping into the non-league with Kidderminster Harriers. He died on 15 June 1994, aged 54.

Facts Ms Kelson was one of three directors of a company called Weston-super-Mare Residential Flats Ltd. She and the other directors were also the trustees of the will of a Mr Robert Butt, which possessed 22,100 out of the 22,852 ordinary shares in the company. They had used the shares to appoint themselves as directors. After Mr Robert Henry Butt died, his son Mr Robert Arthur Butt, who was entitled to a large proportion of the residuary estate was dissatisfied at how the company was being run. He wanted to inspect all the documents which came into the directors' possession, and claimed to be able to do so by virtue of his large beneficial interest. Judgment Romer LJ held that if Mr Arthur Butt wished to see the company documents, made a proper case for it, and was not met by any objection of other beneficiaries, he should be allowed. This was so, not because directors could be compelled qua directors, but because it would avoid them being compelled to use their voting power, which they held on trust, to make them do so. The beneficiaries were entitled to be treated as though they were the registered shareholders in respect of trust shares. If necessary, they could compel the trustee directors to use their votes as the beneficiaries. If the beneficiaries themselves were not in agreement then the court could exercise the power.

Lifecycle  Like many red algae, A. taxiformis has a haplodiplophasic lifecycle, with each phase morphologically distinct. The species' haploid stage was initially described as Falkenbergia hillebrandii (Bornet) Falkenberg 1901 because it was thought to be a separate species.  Culinary uses  poke.alt=left Asparagopsis is one of the most popular types of limu. in the cuisine of Hawaii, it is principally a condiment. It is known as Limu kohu in the Hawaiian language meaning \\"pleasing seaweed\\". Limu kohu is a traditional ingredient in poke. The essential oil of limu kohu is 80% bromoform (tri- bromo-methane) by weight, and includes many other bromine- and iodine- containing organic compounds. Methane emissions reduction in cattle In 2014, researchers at CSIRO and James Cook University demonstrated that feeding ruminants a diet consisting of 1-2% percent red seaweed reduced their methane emissions by over 90 percent. Of 20 types of seaweed tested, A. taxiformis showed the most promise, with nearly 99 percent effectiveness. The findings spurred interest from leading academic and trade organizations to further investigate its effects on ruminant animal production. Some findings of research on these effects have been that the dichloromethane extract (found in A. taxiformis) was the most potent bioactive, reducing methane production by 79%. Other bioactives found were bromoform, dibromochloromethane, bromochloroacetic acid and dibromoacetic acid.Identification of bioactives from the red seaweed Asparagopsis taxiformis that promote antimethanogenic activity in vitro Supply from wild harvest is not expected to be adequate to support broad adoption. A. taxiformis has yet to be commercially farmed at scale. A research/development initiative called Greener Grazing is seeking to close the life cycle of A. taxiformis and demonstrate ocean based grow-out. A startup out of KTH Royal Institute of Technology; Volta Greentech and Symbrosia from Yale University, are both working to grow A. taxiformis. Symbrosia is looking to integrate the cultivation with Whiteleg shrimp on land, using a patent-pending technology.

The Council noted that more efforts would be needed, including by the Economic Community of West African States, to advance the peace process. There was still no State Council installed and no ceasefire was in force. Concern was expressed at inter- and intra-factional fighting in parts of Liberia which had a detrimental effect on the civilian population and the efforts of humanitarian agencies to provide relief. The parties were urged to respect international humanitarian law and human rights. There were continued violations of the arms embargo imposed in Resolution 788 (1992). The Security Council stressed that further support from the international community for the peace process would depend on actions by the Liberian parties to resolve the conflict peacefully. By extending the mandate of UNOMIL until 15 September 1995 the Council expected the parties to use this time to make substantial progress towards the implementation of various agreements, and specifically to: :(a) install at State Council; :(b) restore a ceasefire; :(c) disengage all forces; :(d) create a timetable for the implementation of aspects of the peace agreements. If the steps were not put into effect by 15 September, the mandate of UNOMIL would not be extended, however if they were, it would be enhanced. The parties in Liberia were called upon to respect the status of personnel from UNOMIL and the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) peacekeeping force and allow access to humanitarian aid to the population. Greater efforts were urged by the international community, including contributions to a fund to provide assistance, political efforts by the Organisation of African Unity and co- operation between UNOMIL and ECOMOG.

A mythical creature with the head of an eagle and the body of a lion, it was announced as William & Mary's mascot by President Taylor Reveley April 6, 2010. The Griffin mascot beat out the other four finalists: a King and Queen (dual mascot), a Phoenix, a Pug, and a Wren. The College had not had an official mascot since the late 1970s. It was named Reveley in 2018 to honor university president Taylor Reveley upon his retirement. History The College of William & Mary has a three-century-long history of interaction with the local Pamunkey and Mattaponi Tribes. Originally, the mascot for William and Mary were students that dressed as Native Americans because William & Mary's athletic teams used to be known as the \\"Indians\\", which was later changed to the \\"Tribe.\\" In May 2006, the NCAA ruled that the old athletic logo for William & Mary, which includes two green and gold feathers, could create an environment that is offensive to the Native American community. The NCAA decision irked many William and Mary alumni because Florida State is allowed to retain its nickname, the Seminoles, as well as its American Indian mascot (Chief Osceola) and imagery. The College's appeal regarding the use of the institution‚Äôs athletic logo to the NCAA Executive Committee was rejected. The \\"Tribe\\" nickname, by itself, was found to be neither hostile nor abusive, but rather communicates ennobling sentiments of commitment, shared idealism, community and common cause. The College stated it would phase out the use of the two feathers by the fall of 2007. Due to the changing nature of the athletic teams persona, for a short time, the College's unofficial mascot was a green and gold frog (though it was commonly referred to on campus simply as an 'amorphous green blob') called \\"Colonel Ebirt\\" (\\"Tribe\\" backwards), which was discontinued in 2005. In 2009, William & Mary President Taylor Reveley appointed a committee of alumni, students, faculty, and staff to helm the selection for a new mascot for the college that could serve as a \\"unifying, fun figure on campus\\" as well as making sure that the new mascot \\"look[ed] good on T-Shirts and in costume.\\" In December 2009, five finalists‚Äîincluding a Griffin, King and Queen, the Phoenix, a Pug and the Wren‚Äîwere announced from more than 800 submissions. After announcement of the finalists, there was a month-long public feedback period on the five mascot finalists in which more than 11,000 people completed a survey. The appointed mascot committee reviewed more than 22,000 comments regarding the new mascot. On June 12, 2018, William & Mary Athletic Director Samantha Huge announced that the Griffin would be named Reveley in honor of outgoing President Taylor Reveley, who would retire on June 30, 2018. Announcement and reception On April 6, 2010, President Reveley announced that the College has selected the Griffin as its new mascot. President Reveley stated that the new mascot symbolizes the links between the college's historic ties to both Great Britain, whose monarchy has used the symbol of the lion in the past, and the United States, which uses the eagle as the national symbol.William & Mary unveils new mascot article in The Virginia Gazette William and Mary Athletic Director Terry Driscoll said about the Griffin: \\"The griffin is half eagle and half lion, which symbolizes intelligence and strength, and this what we want our student athletes to represent.\\" The mascot does not have an official name yet. President Reveley stated that a name for the Griffin would not come in the Spring 2010 semester and that: \\"If and when the beast gets a name, we'll let the people decide.\\" The announcement of the new mascot was made fun of by College of William & Mary alumnus Jon Stewart, who stated on the April 8, 2010, broadcast of The Daily Show, \\"William and Mary has announced a new mascot. It is a griffin, which is ancient Greek for the rare pantless tailed eagle. Sorry, but in my day running through campus with no pants on was the students' job.\\" The new mascot was also welcomed into the group of college griffin mascots in a faux \\"open letter\\" to USA Today by the Canisius College Golden Griffin, which stated \\"[Y]ou are a newcomer, if you don't mind my saying so, in this griffin mascot biz, this being your first full day and all. And there is one thing you should know. Please, don't take shots at other griffins.\\"  See also  * List of U.S. college mascots * William & Mary Tribe ‚Äì the athletic program of The College of William & Mary  References  Category:Colonial Athletic Association mascots Category:William & Mary Tribe Category:2010 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Griffin (mascot)"},{"id":"26877901","title":"Visa policy of Mali"},{"id":"26877916","text":"The village of Bor√∞eyri in 1883 thumb Bor√∞eyri is a small hamlet in north-west Iceland.

The primary goal of FSEJ is to help build a solid and unified mass based democratic force. FSEJ is a member of the Eswatini Council of NGOs and is active in a number of civil society networks and organisations that focus on social, political and economical issues. FSEJ also works together with five strategic partners (Community organizations): Lawyers for Human Rights, Eswatini National Union of Students, Eswatini Economic Justice Forum, Street Vendors Association, Eswatini Labour Academy, and Eswatini National Ex-Mine Workers. The mission of FSEJ is to strengthen democracy in the rural population through its member affiliates by conducting civic education and networking. FSEJ works with CBOs and NGOs in the local context and is also part of several international networks. In line with this and with a vision of building a democratic movement in Eswatini, FSEJ also wishes to strengthen the capacity and links between these organisations as well as its own ties with the organisations. The overall goal of the Foundation is to ‚Äúbuild a mass- based democratic force‚Äù through a bottom-up approach that includes partnership with, and capacity building of, marginalized, rural based organisations. In a sense, the Foundation is therefore a complementary organisation to the largely urban-based political organisations such as the newly founded Eswatini United Democratic Front (ESUDF), both because it looks at the preconditions for the processes that these organisations are trying to implement and because it is politically non-aligned and welcomes people from all political persuasions and organisations. FSEJ has participated in a range of NGO coordinating activities; for example in support of the Eswatini United Democratic Front (ESUDF). FSEJ has built a strong management of donor support projects which the SUDF can use. FSEJ is a member of the Coordinating Assembly of NGOs and is active in a number of civil society networks and organisations focusing on social, political and economical issues. It cooperates with trade unions, teachers associations, Eswatini Coalition of Concerned Civic Organizations, Lutheran Development Centre, The Council of Eswatini Churches and the Coordinating Assembly of None Governmental Organizations (CANGO). FSEJ also collaborates with the regional network, The Southern African People‚Äôs Network (SAPSN). FSEJ holds an annual general meeting (AGM) every three years where all affiliated member organizations are invited. At the AGM, the affiliate member organizations elect a seven-member board of directors. The FSEJ implementing project committee consists primarily of professionals and volunteers.

It campaigns against racism and fascism. More recently, it has mounted campaigns against Islamic extremism and antisemitism. It is a self- described non-partisan, non-sectarian third party organisation. The group was founded in 2004 by Nick Lowles, a former editor of anti-fascist magazine Searchlight (from which it split in late 2011). It is backed by various politicians and celebrities, ; Politicians : : : ;Celebrities : and has been backed by several trade unions. History and personnel Hope not Hate was founded in 2004 by Nick Lowles, former editor of the anti-fascist Searchlight magazine. Having experienced street racism as a child, Lowles got involved with the anti-fascist movement as a student volunteer at Sheffield University. Before he became editor, he was an freelance investigative journalist, working in television, including on BBC Panorama, World in Action, Channel Four Dispatches and MacIntyre Undercover. Between 1999 and 2011 Lowles was co- editor, and then editor, of ‚ÄòSearchlight‚Äô magazine. He was awarded an MBE in 2016 for his services in tackling extremism. The Deputy Director is Jemma Levene, who previously worked as Head of Campaigns at Jewish cultural education charity SEED, and at the Orthodox Union in New York. The Political Organiser is Liron Velleman, Policy Officer for the Jewish Labour Movement. Hope not Hate functioned as part of Searchlight until 2011, when the organisations split. As a standalone organisation, Hope not Hate took with it two of the three units of Searchlight: Searchlight Educational Trust (SET), a charity; and Searchlight Information Services (SIS), its research and investigative function. The organisation now consists of Hope not Hate Educational Ltd (a charitable wing) and Hope not Hate Ltd (focused on campaigning and investigative work). From 2010 to 2015, Ruth Smeeth worked as Deputy Director, since when she has been a director. Funding HNH is funded by parochial money, charitable trusts, trade union funding and individual donations. HNH receives no government or EU funding. During late 2012 and early 2013, the Searchlight Educational Trust (SET), which later renamed itself to Hope not Hate Educational (HNH Ed: the charitable wing of Hope not Hate),) received three separate payments totaling ¬£66,000 thanks to a funding agreement signed by the Department for Communities and Local Government. Conditions in the funding agreement prohibited the funds to be spent on anything other than \\"educational work\\", which also included a prohibition on political campaigning. The focus of the allocated funds was to establish community partnerships in four key areas which were prone to EDL activity, including sharing positive local stories and strengthening community bonds. Activities The campaign \\"mobilises communities by providing an alternative to the politics of hate\\". Far right and Islamophobia The organisation encourages voters to support alternatives to far-right extremist movements; it also publishes allegations of violent activities by anti-Muslim organisations such as the English Defence League. It presented a 90,000-person petition to the European Parliament protesting against the election of Nick Griffin as an MEP. Following the murder of Jo Cox, Hope not Hate launched a nationwide #MoreInCommon campaign, with the blessing of the MP's family, hosting meetings across the UK to focus on healing divisions caused by the EU Referendum, culminating in 85+ events on the weekend of 3/4 September 2016. In December 2016 The Guardian newspaper joined a Hope not Hate training workshop, revealing the work undertaken by its community workers on the doorsteps in south Wales. The organisation has increasingly focused upon community-based campaigning, particularly building what it calls \\"community resilience\\" and focusing more on women voters. It has launched initiatives in support of British foods, Hate Crime Awareness Week, and reported extensively on the activities of the anti-Muslim counterjihad movement of Robert Spencer, Pamela Geller, and bloggers such as \\"Fjordman\\". It said a small number of extremists online expressed ideology shared by Anders Behring Breivik, the Norwegian responsible for the 2011 Norway attacks. In 2012 the group published original research looking at the attitudes of voters towards far-right political parties in the UK, which concluded that nearly half of those polled by a Populus Ltd survey supported the creation of an English nationalist, anti- Muslim political party. Nick Lowles claimed in 2012 that politicians, including the Labour Party, need to address the way they talk about immigration and move away from encouraging \\"hate speech\\". Liz Fekete, of the Institute for Race Relations (IRR), has said that Lowles has not taken a hard enough line against racial narratives on the grooming issue. The organisation updated its research in February 2016, noting: \\"Respondents to the new Fear and HOPE 2016 survey were much more positive about personal and national progress, more economically secure, and less anxious about identity change.\\" A further poll, one week after the Brexit vote, revealed that nearly two-thirds (63%) of those polled believed Britain was \\"more divided as a result of the Referendum vote and more people think there are more tensions between communities than when asked the same question in February\\". Following a 26,000 signature petition handed in by Hope not Hate to the UK Home Secretary, on 26 June 2013 the US anti-Muslim bloggers Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller were banned from entering the UK. Geller and Spencer had been due to speak at an English Defence League march in Woolwich, south London, where Drummer Lee Rigby was murdered. Home Secretary Theresa May informed Spencer and Geller that their presence in the UK would \\"not be conducive to the public good\\". The decision, which they cannot appeal, may be reviewed in between three and five years. Similarly, Hope Not Hate condemned an EDL solidarity demonstration outside the Israeli embassy to which they had invited an American rabbi, with Lowles writing \\"While many in the Jewish community have understandable concerns about the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, it is important to remember that the EDL are not our friends\\". Hope not Hate was, in 2013, one of the founding organisations of an anti-child sexual exploitation initiative called CAASE (Community Alliance Against Sexual Exploitation), featuring many Muslim and Christian organisations, victim support groups, survivors organisations, and local community networks. The network was a response to multiple \\"grooming\\" cases reported in the British press. Islamic extremism More recently, it has also focused on Islamist extremists and issues of communal division, such as grooming. In November 2013 the organisation unveiled research into the al-Muhajiroun Islamic extremist network: in a 60-page report, Gateway to Terror, authored by Nick Lowles and Joe Mulhall, it alleged that with its partner networks al-Muhajiroun had sent up to 300 fighters to Syria, linked a further seventy individuals to terrorism offences or suicide bombings, plus proof of what it said was links to the Westgate shopping mall attack in Kenya, connections to al-Shabaab and a plot by French security services to kill Abu Hamza in the late 1990s. On 16 October 2014 the organisation launched a new blog, Generation Jihad, which it said would \\"be a forum to monitor, expose and understand militant jihadism and extreme Islamism\\". Once Anjem Choudary was found guilty of inviting support for the Islamic State in August 2016, Hope not Hate updated its research and revealed that Choudary and his extremist groups had motivated at least a hundred people from Britain to pursue terrorism. Brexit In 2013 the organisation initiated a nationwide consultation among its supporters about the UK Independence Party (UKIP). The move attracted considerable criticism from some on the right. It went on to campaign vociferously against UKIP during the run- up to the 2014 European elections. On 20 March 2019, Catherine Blaiklock, founder of the Brexit Party, resigned from the party after The Guardian enquired about deleted anti-Muslim messages from her Twitter account from before she took on the role. Blaiklock's deleted tweets were recovered by Hope not Hate and passed to The Guardian. In November 2019, Hope not Hate said \\"An election has just been called for the 12th December 2019 and our priority is clear ‚Äì we're going to be taking on Nigel Farage and his Brexit party, to make sure they don't win any seats.\\" The organisation funded research, along with Best for Britain, used to encourage pro-Remain tactical voting. Antisemitism Hope not Hate have commented regularly on antisemitism allegations in the Labour Party. In June 2019, the group condemned Lisa Forbes after she was found to have 'liked' a post on Facebook saying that Theresa May had a \\"Zionist Slave Master's agenda\\". In July 2019, Lowles said that there had been \\"an appalling lack of understanding of the hurt and fear felt by Jewish party members and the Jewish community\\". He also said that \\"the leadership should start listening to people like the Jewish Labour Movement and bringing forward substantial organisational and cultural change.\\" In November 2019, Lowles was reported to have written to every member of Labour's National Executive Committee, urging them to bar suspended MP Chris Williamson from defending his seat at the following month's general election and to expel him from the party. Criticism In November 2016, Hope not Hate published an incorrect press release about a report on the extent of abusive social media following the murder of Jo Cox MP by a right-wing extremist. According to an investigation by The Economist, \\"The report itself gave a confusing impression of the number of tweets that celebrated Ms Cox‚Äôs murder\\" and that \\"Hope Not Hate‚Äôs mistake is to take xenophobic Brexit-related tweets (which are plentiful, though a tiny fraction of the whole) and add them to tweets celebrating the murder of an MP (which as far as we can establish were very rare) to make a single tally of hatred. It then compounds the error by focusing on Ms Cox in the report‚Äôs headline and the initial press release.\\" A corrected version of the release was subsequently sent to all other media for the report's official launch, and the original article was withdrawn. In December 2016 the British politician Nigel Farage accused the group of being \\"extremists\\" who \\"masquerade as being lovely and peaceful but actually pursue violent and very undemocratic means\\", after Jo Cox's widower husband Brendan Cox had chosen Hope not Hate as one of three beneficiaries of her memorial fund. The group responded by setting up a crowdfunded appeal for a legal fund to sue Farage over the remarks. Hope Not Hate proceeded to issue a claim against Farage for libel. In November 2017, shortly before the libel case came to court, it was settled as Farage agreed to withdraw his comments. In February 2016 Nick Lowles was \\"de-platformed\\" from a National Union of Students event by NUS Black Students, which said that he was Islamophobic. In August 2019, Assistant Editor of the Daily Telegraph Philip Johnston criticised the group for not doing enough to acknowledge that the United Kingdom was \\"among the least racist, least extreme and most inclusive [countries] in the world\\".  Publications  Hope not Hate magazine (September 2012) The campaign publishes an eponymous bi-monthly magazine; in 2011 it commissioned an opinion poll on electoral attitudes towards English identity, faith and race, published as the Fear and Hope survey. In 2012 it issued a report on the counterjihad movement, the Counter-Jihad Report; and in the same year produced a 75th anniversary guide to the Battle of Cable Street.

John o' Groats lies on Great Britain's northeastern tip, and is popular with tourists as one end of the longest distance between two inhabited British points on the mainland, with Land's End in Cornwall lying southwest. However, it is not the northernmost point of Great Britain, which is the nearby Dunnet Head. John o' Groats is from London, from Edinburgh, from the Orkney Isles and from the North Pole. It is from the uninhabited Island of Stroma. In summer, a ferry operates between John o' Groats and Burwick on South Ronaldsay in Orkney.John O'Groats ferry website Name The settlement takes its name from Jan de Groot, a 15th-century Dutchman who once plied a ferry from the Scottish mainland to Orkney, which had recently been acquired from Norway by King James IV. Local legend has that the \\"o' Groats\\" refers to John's charge of one groat for use of his ferry, but it actually derives from the Dutch de groot, meaning \\"the large\\". People from John o' Groats are known as \\"Groaters\\". The name John o' Groats has a particular resonance because it is often used as a starting or ending point for cycles, walks and charitable events to and from Land's End (at the extreme south-western tip of the Cornish peninsula in England). The phrase Land's End to John o' Groats is frequently heard both as a literal journey (being the longest possible in Great Britain) and as a metaphor for great or all-encompassing distance, similar to the American phrase coast to coast. Also, for many years it was the northern terminal of the A9 trunk road, which now ends at Scrabster. Demography In 2007, the population of John o' Groats was about 300.John o' Groats tourist information, 29 October 2007 The village is dispersed but has a linear centre with council housing, sports park and a shop which is on the main road from the nearest town of Wick. Aerial view Tourism John o' Groats attracts large numbers of tourists from all across the world all year round. In 2005, a popular tourist guide, Lonely Planet, described the village as a \\"seedy tourist trap\\"\\"Northern outpost dubbed 'seedy'\\", BBC News and in 2010 John o' Groats received a Carbuncle Award from Urban Realm magazine for being \\"Scotland's most dismal town\\".\\"John O' Groats named Scotland's most dismal town\\", The Carbuncle Awards, Urban Realm (accessed 2014-08-19). 2013 however saw the completion of major redevelopment work which hopes to revitalise the area.\\"John O'Groats: a new starts for the end of the road\\", The Guardian, 31 August 2012.

Signpost The free signpost The landmark \\"Journey's End\\" signpost at John o' Groats was installed in 1964 on private land and operated as a visitor attraction by a Penzance-based photography company that also operates its counterpart at Land's End. Visitors paid a fee for a photograph of themselves next to the signpost displaying either a message or the date and distance to a location of their choice. The original site was bought in 2013 as part of the hotel redevelopment, and the signpost moved to a caravan park away. When the hotel reopened, a publicly accessible signpost was erected at the original site, without customisable text. Sport John o' Groats FC plays in the Caithness Amateur Football Association.

It is the cycling counterpart of the Elfstedentocht ice-skating tour which is held irregularly on frozen waterways in the same region. History Due to the popularity of the Eleven Cities Skating tour, a similar tour was hosted for cyclists in the beginning of the 20th century. In 1912 the first cycling tour was organised. It started out as a competition, and was organised when the skating counterpart wasn't organised due to the weather. Since 1947, the tour has been organised annually on Whit Monday, a Dutch Bank holiday. Although the tour started out as a race, from 1958 it was hosted as a tour in order to prevent serious injuries. Due to popular interest by non-professional cyclist, and the sometimes less-ideal conditions of the road, it was considered to be too dangerous to race. To prevent enthusiasts from racing anyway, participants are to keep in mind a maximum average speed of 25 km/h between check points. Route The cycling tour's route differs from its counterpart on skates: the cycling tour starts and ends in Bolsward rather than in Leeuwarden. The tour takes the participants through the eleven ancient cities of the province of Frisia. The tour is currently limited to 15,000 entrants. Between 05:00 and 08:00, entrants leave Bolsward every eight minutes in batches of 600 participants. Those who complete the 235 km tour before midnight are entitled to a medal. Types of bicycles While most participants use a racing bicycle, other types of bikes can be seen as well. A small percentage participates on tandem bicycles, European city bicycles both with and without gears, rowing cycles and handcycles. Even penny-farthings have been used for the tour.

Beginnings One of the first Maseratis the Tipo 26 driven by Alfieri Maserati with Guerino Bertocchi acting as riding mechanic won the Targa Florio 1,500 cc class in 1926, finishing in ninth place in overall. Maserati was very successful in pre-war Grand Prix racing using a variety of cars with 4, 6, 8 and 16 cylinders (two straight-eights mounted parallel to one another). Other notable pre-war successes include winning the Indianapolis 500 twice (1939 and 1940), both times with Wilbur Shaw at the wheel of a 8CTF. Sports and GT cars Maserati won the Targa Florio in 1937, 1938, 1939 and 1940. The first two wins were achieved by Giovanni Rocco with a Maserati 6CM and the last two by Luigi Villoresi with a 6CM in 1939 and a 4CL in 1940. Maserati's post-war factory effort in sports car racing began in 1954 for the second season of the World Sportscar Championship. The factory raced as Officine Alfieri Maserati. World Sports Car Championship Maserati placed second in the 1956 World Sportscar Championship with the 300S Maserati scored points in all but one year of the first era of the World Sports Car Championship from 1953 to 1961. Both factory-entered and privately-entered cars were eligible to score points for the manufacturer. At the end of 1957 Maserati retired the factory team from racing though they continued to build cars for privateers. In the 1953 World Sportscar Championship Maserati placed thirteenth. In the 1954 World Sportscar Championship Maserati entered the Maserati A6GCS and placed fifth. In the 1955 World Sportscar Championship Maserati placed fourth. In the 1956 World Sportscar Championship Maserati placed second including a win at the 1000 km Buenos Aires and the 1000 km at the N√ºrburgring. The win at 1956 1000 km Buenos Aires was a Maserati 300S sports car driven by Stirling Moss and Carlos Mendit√©guy. In the 1957 World Sportscar Championship Maserati again placed second. This time with wins at Sebring and Rabel√∂fsbanan In the 1959 World Sportscar Championship Maserati placed fourth. In the 1960 World Sportscar Championship Maserati placed third. With a win at the ADAC 1000 km N√ºrburgring for a Maserati Tipo 61 driven by Stirling Moss and Dan Gurney. In the 1961 World Sportscar Championship Maserati placed second. With a repeat win at the ADAC 1000 km N√ºrburgring for a Maserati Tipo 61 this time driven by Lloyd Casner and Masten Gregory. FIA GT Championship Maserati returned to sportscar racing in 2004, entering the Maserati MC12 in the FIA GT Championship. Since 2005 the MC12 fielded by Vitaphone Racing Team won five teams' championships and four drivers' championships in a row. FIA GT1 World Championship Michael Bartels and Andrea Bertolini won the inaugural GT1 World Championship for Drivers in the 2010 FIA GT1 World Championship driving a Maserati MC12 for the Vitaphone Racing Team.

The cars for the 1987 World Touring Car Championship season were entered by Pro Team Italia/Imberti. The car was in Group A Division 3 competing against the Ford Sierra RS Cosworth and later in the season Ford Sierra RS 500. The car was driven by Bruno Giacomelli, Armin Hahne, Marcello Gunella, Mario Hytten, Nicola Tesini and Kevin Bartlett. For the British Touring Car Championship the cars were entered by Trident Motorsport. This was for the 1988 and 1989 seasons. The car was driven by Nick May, John Lepp and Vic Lee. Rally cars A former 1987 WTCC car was bought by Adriano Dece who converted it for used on road rallies and the company also manufactured the Maserati Biturbo Group A Rally car. Formula One Maserati participated in Formula One motor racing during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Its works Formula One programme was broadly successful, providing a total of 9 Grand Prix wins for the factory team. In addition, Juan Manuel Fangio won the 1957 World Championship of Drivers with a Maserati 250F. Maserati designed two Formula One cars: the Maserati 4CLT and the Maserati 250F, and the pre-World War II Maserati 4CL was also used with some success. In addition, the Maserati A6GCM, designed as a Formula Two car, was also used in F1. Due to financial difficulties in the late 1950s the team had to withdraw from Formula One in 1958 despite the 250F still being successful. Privateers continued to use the 250F until 1960. In the 1960s, Maserati supplied engines to British Formula One team Cooper. The most successful car of that collaboration was the Cooper- Maserati T81, which had a Maserati V12 engine. It won the 1966 Mexican Grand Prix and the 1967 South African Grand Prix, driven by John Surtees and Pedro Rodr√≠guez respectively.  Beginnings of Formula One operation  The 1948 Maserati 4CLT was one of the first cars built to the new Formula One regulations, introduced in 1946, and was developed from the 1938 Maserati 4CL voiturette car. The older design was still competitive despite the hiatus of World War II and was entered into Formula One races when racing resumed after the war. Its success encouraged Maserati to develop the car's design and these refinements were brought together as the 4CLT.

Stone stele records of imperial examinations of the L√™ and M·∫°c dynasties () is a collection of 82 stone stelae that contain the names and related information of doctoral laureates who passed the imperial examinations during the reign of the L√™ and M·∫°c dynasties from 1442 to 1779. Preserved in good condition in the Temple of Literature of Hanoi, Vietnam, the collection became an inscription of the UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme on March 9, 2010. Description The 82 stelae were made from stone in the form of tortoise-mounted tablet since tortoise was traditionally considered a symbol of longevity and everlastingness in Vietnamese culture. There are three principal types of stele corresponding with three different periods of the L√™ and M·∫°c dynasties, besides each stele was decorated with diverse patterns from Taoist-influenced design to everyday images such as farmer or animals. According to the researcher Nguy·ªÖn Vinh Ph√∫c, there is possibly an 83rd stele in the collection since people discovered a stone tortoise at the bottom of the lake in the Temple of Literature. After each examination, a new stele was erected with detailed information about the process of the examination, number of participants and profiles of all laureates. Besides, engraved in each stele is a statement describing the meaning of education and talent for the country and reflecting the Confucian philosophy and tradition of Vietnam. This public recognition of the achievements of the laureates was meant to encourage other students to serve the society in similar manner. One of the most cited statements is the engraving of the first stele which was redacted by Th√¢n Nh√¢n Trung in 1484 for the 1442 imperial examination during the reign of L√™ Th√°i T√¥ng: { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" width=\\"90%\\" style=\\"background- color: #EEEEEE;\\" -----  > ‚Äî Excellent talents with good virtue are the sap of the country. If the sap > is strong, the country will be strong and progress. If the sap is weak, the > country will weaken and degrade. For that reason, there is no clear-sighted > king who is not concerned about building and developing talent. } History The first stele of the collection. In total, there are 2,313 names of laureates that were carved in the stelae, they were recognized after passing imperial examination between 1484 and 1780 organized by the L√™, M·∫°c, Tr·ªãnh and Nguy·ªÖn dynasties. The first one was erected in 1484 during the reign of L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng with the record of the 1442 imperial examination while the last stele was made in 1780 for the 1779 examination. Among the names engraved in the collection are many well-known figures in the history of Vietnam such as the historian Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n, the scholar L√™ Qu√Ω ƒê√¥n or the diplomat Ng√¥ Th√¨ Nh·∫≠m. Some of those names during the period of Tr·ªãnh lords were afterwards crossed out by orders of the Nguy·ªÖn emperors since the laureates had participated in activities considered against the Nguy·ªÖn lords. Since the stelae were partly damaged during the war between the T√¢y S∆°n dynasty and the troops of Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh, the emperor Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n wanted to restore the collection but could not complete the work because of the collapse of the T√¢y S∆°n dynasty in 1802. After the establishment of the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty, the emperor Gia Long decided to transfer the capital from Hanoi to Hu·∫ø, thus a new Temple of Literature was built in Hu·∫ø where new stelae were placed. The total number of stelae in Hu·∫ø is 32 with the last one dated in 1919. The collection is appreciated as a national treasure of Vietnam because it provides not only information about the education during 300 years of dynastic Vietnam but also the details about the system of imperial examinations of the past dynasties. Memory of the World Initially, the Vietnamese nominations in 2007 and 2008 for the Memory of the World Programme were the Woodblocks of the Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty and a collection of old photographs of Indochina. While the former was quickly registered by UNESCO in 2009, the latter was finally replaced by the collection of stone stelae of the L√™ and M·∫°c dynasties which was considered more original and intact. This nomination was ultimately accepted by UNESCO at its meeting in Macau on March 9, 2010 and thus the collection of stele records became the second entry of Vietnam in the list of the Memory of the World.

Apart from river sediments, they also occur in lacustrine and marine deposits.Major Soils of the World. ISRIC Wageningen, The Netherlands, 2001 Fluvisols correlate with fluvents and fluvaquents of the USDA soil taxonomy. The good natural fertility of most fluvisols and their attractive dwelling sites on river levees and higher parts in marine landscapes were recognized in prehistoric times. Fluvisols are found on alluvial plains, river fans, valleys and tidal marshes on all continents and in all climate zones. Under natural conditions periodical flooding is fairly common. The soils have a clear evidence of stratification. Soil horizons are weakly developed, but a distinct topsoil horizon may be present. Many dryland crops are grown on fluvisols, normally with some form of water control. On tropicalfFluvisols with satisfactory irrigation and drainage paddy rice cultivation is widespread. Some coastal lowlands have fluvisols with sulphidic material within the profile (a thionic horizon). These acid sulfate soils have severe constraints for agricultural use as low pH-values, toxic aluminium levels and high concentrations of salts. Tidal lands that are strongly saline are best kept under mangroves or some other salt-vegetation. Major concentrations of fluvisols are found along rivers and lakes, e.g. in the Amazon Basin, the Ganges Plain of India, the plains near Lake Chad in Central Africa, and the marshlands of Brazil, Paraguay and northern Argentina. Also in deltaic areas, e.g. the deltas of the Ganges‚ÄìBrahmaputra, Indus, Mekong, Mississippi, Nile, Niger, Orinoco, Po, Rhine, Rio de la Plata, and Zambezi. Furthermore in areas of recent marine deposits, e.g. the coastal lowlands of Sumatra, Kalimantan, Irian Jaya and Papua New Guinea.

Available from: Academic Search Premier Methods have been developed in order to determine the most suitable sites for tidal farms. Factors considered in the selection of locations include potential to provide the greatest power performance, the least amount of cost, and the least amount of inconvenience towards marine life. A case study done in the Bristol Channel used a hydrodynamic model on a Matlab-based program in order to obtain its results. Technology Tidal Farms utilize tidal stream generators that are grouped together to produce electricity. These generators use the moving tides to turn turbines that are very similar the wind turbines used on land. The power of the ocean and the turbines advance technology guarantee a much more predictable energy output then regular wind turbines. The turbines are usually located in areas with high tidal activity in order for the generators to be as efficient as possible. What makes tidal farms unique is that they are set up in groups to allow much more energy production. The generators are connected to substations on shore to transform voltage from high to low, or low to high. These generators can be semi-submersible or fixed into the sea floor, which means they would be out of sight and not an eyesore for the public. The turbines that would be used would be very slow moving due to the density of the water, this is very beneficial to the aquatic life because fish would be able to freely pass through without being in danger of dying. Some turbines can also be used in irrigation canals, rivers, and dam whether the flow of water is fast or slow. Operators Scotland is one of the main leaders in the effort to utilize tidal energy as an alternative energy resource. In 2012, Scottish Power installed a 30 ft. turbine off of the Orkney Islands. The currents off of these islands are very fast moving and the tests conducted had shown that the generator produced one megawatt of electricity, enough to power 500 homes. Scotland is also looking to install a more powerful generator off of the Sound of Islay that would be capable of powering in upwards of 5,000 homes once fully operational.Macguire, E. (2012, June 1) Tide turns towards undersea energy In January 2015, production of a 400-megawatt tidal generator was being constructed in Northern Scotland. This generator would be capable of powering 175,000 homes.Richardson, J. (2015, January 5). 400 MW Scottish Tidal Energy Farm To Begin Construction Ocean power is a clean and efficiency with an energy source that never turns off. Using Tidal farms is a much cleaner and efficient way to produce electricity. One of the drawbacks to tidal farms is marine life and how it will affect it. They would also need to set the tidal farms deep in the ocean where it won't affect fishing boats or large ship passing by. The United States of America has nearly 12,380 miles of coastline, and is currently offering up to $22 million in funding for research into marine power sources.  Leaders in Practice  The company Ocean Flow used Siemens technology to design a semi-submersible turbine. The models created have proven to be able to withstand sea conditions excellently. The company claims its model creates less disturbances to its surrounding ecosystem, and cost less to deploy. A key feature to this model set up is the platform that the turbine rest on. It was developed at Newcastle University School of Marine Science and Technology in 2006. The Platform is suitable to withstand harsh conditions in deep depth of the ocean. Senior development engineer at OceanFlow Mark Knos commented on the project and stated that they had created a 1/40th scale model to test and a 1/10 scale model as well. Both models were tested and have provided promising results.Subsea World News. \\"Ocean Flow uses Siemens technology for semi- submersible tidal turbine\\"  Tidal Farm Generation in North America  North America has fewer tidal power stations than any other comparable geographical area, in terms of GDP or population. Tidal power has been estimated to be able to account for fifteen percent of the United States‚Äô power consumption if harnessed correctly. The first tidal instillation in North America to connect to a power grid was laid down in 2012, in Cobscook Bay, Maine by the Ocean Renewable Power Company. The preliminary device generates 180 Kilowatts at full capacity. Plans to install two more devices were shelved as of 2013. Tidal generators were installed in 2009 by OpenHydro and Emera the Bay of Fundy. These tidal generators suffered damage, losing several blades in the process, due to the powerful tides in the Bay. In the autumn of 2016 a joint venture by the same two companies successfully placed a 2-Megawatt tidal generator in the Bay of Fundy, of which Cobscook Bay is a constituent area. The successful integration of the new tidal generators to local power stations, and the connected power grid supplies an estimated 150 to 200 homes per day.  Types  ‚Ä¢ Double and Three Bladed Turbine are turbines attached to a stationary pole and rotate axial to chase the ocean currents. Some of the double and triple bladed turbines can have two sets attached to the pole for better efficiency. This type of turbine has to be detached from the stationary pole and lifter with cranes attached to ships when maintenance is to be performed. ‚Ä¢ Semi Submersible Turbines is a more expensive turbine but in the long run it is cheaper and is more cost efficient. The turbines are connecting to a stationary post and the turbine generator can be raised and lowered anytime for maintenance. ‚Ä¢ Duct Style Turbine uses duct all the way around the entrance of the turbine to guide and accelerate the tidal stream toward the rotor. By using a duct, more energy can be extracted from the same amount of water with smaller diameter rotor blades thereby keeping costs of manufacture and maintenance down. ‚Ä¢ Cable Tethered Turbine floating turbines are attached by a chain to a stationary point in the bottom of the ocean and follow the ocean current in a horizontal 360 degrees. These turbines are easy to bring up to the surface for maintenance because they are pressurized with air. They are also equipped with sensors to detect any water trying to make its way into the pressurized generator. Problems One of the few environmental unknowns about tidal farms is the threat they may pose to the plant life in the areas that the turbines would be set up.Paul Taylor SeaGen Tidal Turbine gets all- clear from environmental & scientific studies But by having the blades turn at a slower than normal speed wind turbines can eliminate some of the potential environmental problems. Another problem that can occur is making the turbines water tight to prevent seawater from corrosion the metal parts inside the turbine. Underwater turbines would have to be position away from shipping lanes, too close to shore, and in deep enough waters for them not to interfere with everyday shipping traffic. Having countries like Scotland position underwater turbines can help other countries learn and explore better ideas for creating energy by learning from the successes and the failures achieved by the leading countries. Scotland expects the rest of the world to follow their example and install tidal farms all over the world in the efforts to help stop pollution and make producing energy cleaner and safer.  Effects on ocean geography and tidal patterns  Tidal farms present many possible environmental and ecological changes to the environment they are placed in. The structures of these farms produce changes in tidal patterns, sediment flow, and water column turbulence. Tidal patterns can be affected in different ways depending on the structure of the farm itself. The structure is referring to the size and cross-sectional area because the number of blades or the load that is put on the farm doesn't make much of a difference on the overall height of the water. These effects can be seen to lower both the high tide and low tides which means that the water level will be lower in total. The number of blades and load on the system however does affect the tidal range vastly. Tidal range can be reduced up to 42% with observations of the densest farms which can cause destruction to 32% of the areas around them, but it can be controlled. Damage can be reduced to 19% by using a two-rotor spaced turbine and only 5.4% with five-rotor spaced turbines. This is done by spreading the water's work over a large surface area on the turbine itself to mitigate the alteration of the flow in the water column. Sediment flow is affected by the introduction of tidal farms to an area. Not only does it create turbulence that moves the sediment, but it changes the ecosystem around it. By moving more sediment into areas that didn't gain much before, places like grass beds could be wiped out by being covered in sediment. The geography on the ocean floor would be changed by the new sediment flow patterns because of the new turbulence. New things like sandbars could form around the farms causing even more of an impact to the surrounding environment by influencing more changes than originally expected. The water column also faces multiple chances since the force it transfers through turbulence is being absorbed by the tidal farms. Waves would be directly affected by the reduced energy behind the water causing them to be weaker which too could destroy multiple ecosystems. There would also be an effect on the inter-tidal zones with there being less turbulence which many species like fish and crabs use for sustenance and survival. Other things like noise and electromagnetic fields also pose problems for the environment, but not to the scale that the last effects had on the geography and life in an ecosystem.  Effects on ecology  The prime placement of tidal farms occurs in tidal barrages, marshes, lagoons and other intertidal bodies of waters most commonly home to migratory wetland birds. The placement of tidal farms raises the water levels to a point where the feeding areas of the birds are submerged. With the loss of feeding areas, mortality rates increase. Furthermore, studies were conducted by University of Exeter faculty for wetland birds in the Solway Firth, UK. These studies concluded that the effect of certain types of tidal farms are negligible. The impacts of tidal farms on water foul habitats in the Solway Firth were found to be relatively low, even for the largest case. The study highlighted that current installations with similar capacities as the simulations had a lower loss of intertidal area than that of its computer-generated counterpart . One conclusion reached was that future studies should focus on the vulnerability of an individual species, as compared to the effect on maritime birds as a whole. The construction of tidal barrages within a bay, inlet, or estuary is one of the few cases where inter species relations were universally affected. The retention of tidal water alters the timetable of species which dominate the upper to intermediate shore habitats. Simultaneously the lower shore remains submerged for longer periods of time. The resulting forced ecosystem is disruptive to the majority of species present, with the exception of fish whom are tidal feeders. The extended periods of high tide allow for greater foraging opportunity, hence a growth in population can be observed in these cases. The structures of larger tidal barrages alter the scour and deposition in their respective habitats. Scour and deposition refers to the movement and exchange of sediment along the floor of a water body. The U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center in Vicksburg, Mississippi stated that the interruption of natural sediment deposits directly led to an increased mortality rate of seabed grass, as the shoot could not properly grow in the altered seafloor. This would be even more devastating for benthic life which resides under the ocean floor since they are easily affected by changes in the flow over the bottom of the ocean. It would be hard to prevent this too since these organisms aren‚Äôt easily relocated since they are so sensitive to changes in their atmosphere.

Songs and dance Hokama Shuzen hypothesized that the etymology of kuichaa was kui (voice, Standard Japanese koe) and  ßaÀêsuÃ• (to combine, Standard Japanese uchi- awasu). As the etymology suggests, kuichaa is characterized by group singing. A group of young men and women forms a circle. The dance is a rhythmical and vigorous one, with arms shaking to and fro and left and right, legs stamping on the ground, dancing high and with hands clapping. The themes of song vary.

Snell played professionally in the North American Soccer League and the Major Indoor Soccer League and coached in the FC Dallas youth system for eight years, and is widely considered one of the top youth development coaches in the country for Zone 1 (6‚Äì12 yr olds). Player Snell graduated from Lockport Senior High School where he was a 1975 High School All American soccer player and held the school record for shutouts (10) in one season for over 30 years. In 2009 Snell was inducted into the Lockport High School Athletic Hall of Fame. He attended Hartwick College where he played for Head Coach Jim Lennox on the school's soccer team from 1976 to 1979. In 1977, Snell and his teammates won the NCAA Men's Division I Soccer Championship. In 1979 Snell and fellow goalkeeper Aly Anderson set the school record for shutouts (10) in a season with each having five. Snell credits his mentor Jim Lennox as the most influential person in his coaching career as he spent 4 years with him as a player and 5 as an assistant. In 1980, he signed with the Edmonton Drillers of the North American Soccer League who sent him on loan to 1. FC Viersen 05, a 3rd division German team. Kicker Magazine cited Snell as the only American at that time playing in the top 3 divisions in Germany. While there he was able to train with Borussia Monchengladbach In 1981, he joined the Buffalo Stallions of the Major Indoor Soccer League before finishing his career in 1985 with the Wichita Wings. Youth coaching During his tenure at FC Dallas, Snell developed a curriculum that included teaching age-appropriate tactics through small-sided games for ages U7-U11. Snell's philosophy was that the \\"best train with the best\\", and created the Premier team format which grouped all of the top players in each age group into one team. Initially, players of all levels were scattered across many teams within each age group. Snell felt the best development model was having teams made up of \\"like\\" talent so that training would be competitive for all teams regardless of talent level. He also authored and managed the street soccer- based \\"FCD LIGA\\" which was a 3v3/4v4 house league for FC Dallas players on Sundays. He grew the wildly successful program from 5 teams to over 30 teams to preach the small-sided game's format to all the coaches as the best player development tool. He also organized and managed the FC Dallas Development League which hosted the top U9 teams in the Dallas Metroplex. Snell's training methodology was heavily influenced through TGFU, Constraints Led Approach (CLA) and Games Based Learning. Coaching career In 1996, Snell became the freshman team coach at Canisius High School in Buffalo, NY. That year, he led the freshman team to an undefeated season and the league championship. In 1998, Snell returned to his alma mater and became an assistant with Hartwick College.Snell promoted to top soccer assistant at Hartwick and also joined the Region 1 ODP Staff. In January 2003, Jim Lennox unexpectedly resigned as head coach of the Hawks (Warriors) and Snell became the interim head coach. The school chose to hire Ian McIntyre before the 2003 season began and Snell left the school to begin a career in club coaching. After spending time with the FC Dallas youth teams for eight years, Snell set off on an 18-month sabbatical where he researched and studied youth academies worldwide. Through his research, he befriended coaches around the globe and also studied Pep Guardiola's \\"Juego de Posicion\\" (Positional Play) system. Snell discovered that his philosophy of teaching age-appropriate tactics starting at the younger ages through small-sided games was actually based on Positional Play. In 2014, Snell became the inaugural head coach of Fort Worth Vaqueros FC of the National Premier Soccer League. FC Dallas: Mark Snell Recently, Snell has been named Academy Director of the Fort Worth Vaqueros new youth academy where they are set to announce a free academy in the summer of 2018 for the most talented players in the Fort Worth area. A new Vaqueros Field at Sycamore Park (2400 East Vickery Blvd Fort Worth, Texas 76104) is being built through a partnership with the City of Fort Worth and set to be completed in May 2018. Snell has numerous credentials such as a US Soccer Federation A License, a US Youth Soccer National Youth License and an NSCAA Premier Diploma. Ten of Snell's former FC Dallas players have been called up by the youth national teams of the USA, Colombia, Bosnia & Herzegovina and Guatemala, while 2 former players have signed professional contracts with FC Dallas. Snell is currently the Academy Director of the Fort Worth Vaqueros.

On 28 February 1998, a firefight erupted between Albanian militants and a Serbian police patrol in the small village of Liko≈°ane. Four Serbian policemen were killed and several were injured. The KLA militants, one of whom was Adem Jashari, escaped. Subsequently, Serbian police killed thirteen people in a nearby household. Later that same day, Serbian policemen attacked the neighbouring village of ƒÜirez and subsequently killed 26 Albanians. However, the Albanian militants who had incited the violence managed to escape and the police decided to move in on Adem Jashari and his family. Background=According to HRW (1998) On 28 February 1998, according to Serbian police, armed Albanians attacked a police patrol near the village of Liko≈°ane, killing four policemen and seriously wounding two. A pro- government report told that there were three simultaneous attacks on police patrols. Albanians from Liko≈°ane informed the Human Rights Watch (HRW) that they heard shooting near the village around 11 PM, and some heard that the police had been ambushed there. Unconfirmed reports tell that armed Albanians attacked the police-based ammunition plant near Donji Prekaz on 27 February, and that the police were ambushed at Liko≈°ane after a police chase. According to AI (1999) Albanian witnesses stated that events began on the evening of 27 February, \\"when the KLA fired at a school housing Bosnian or Croatian Serb refugees in the nearby town of Srbica\\". According to Amnesty International: Events=Liko≈°ane The police arrived at Liko≈°ane between 11:30 AM and 12 PM, with a hovering police helicopter and many APCs and armed special police surrounding the house of the Ahmeti family. The family was the richest one in the village. Villagers told HRW that there were no KLA present, though it is possible that shots were fired at the police. In a quick and well-organized manner, suggesting that the attack was planned, the special police focused on two neighbouring households, of the Gjeli and Ahmeti families. There are speculations over whether a KLA members entered and left the Ahmeti house. At ca. 3:30 PM, the police broke into the Ahmeti compound. Ten male members of the family, and a guest, aged between 16 and 50, were beaten and then extrajudicially executed. The only Ahmeti brother to survive was away at the time, returning to Liko≈°ane after hearing of the incident; according to him, as told to HRW, when he arrived at 8 AM on 1 March, looking from a hill, he saw \\"an APC in our compound and another outside. A third was behind. There was artillery all over and the police were shooting everywhere\\". According to him the police left 3:30 PM, he then went to his house and was told that ten male family members and a guest had been taken into custody. He also told HRW that furniture had been destroyed and valuables stolen. The Ahmeti family learnt of the death of their men the next day, when a neighbour, of the Gjeli family, saw their bodies at the morgue while collecting the bodies of his two killed family members. On 3 March the bodies were buried, along with 15 other victims from Liko≈°ane and ƒÜirez. An American journalist told HRW that the Ahmeti bodies had clear signs of torture. ƒÜirez=Nata≈°a Kandiƒá's accusations Nata≈°a Kandiƒá of Belgrade's Humanitarian Law Center, accused Danica Marinkoviƒá, formerly investigating judge of the Pri≈°tina District Court, of being responsible for the murders of the Ahmeti family. Kandiƒá stated that some former Serbian policemen witnessed that \\"Danica Marinkoviƒá personally ordered several wounded members of the Ahmeti family to be shot on 28 February 1998 in the village of Liko≈°ane\\". According to the allegations, Marinkoviƒá came, as an investigating judge, to conduct an on-site investigation. There was a pile of bodies outside the Ahmeti house in which some men were still giving signs of life. In the presence of about 30 members of the Special Anti-Terrorism Unit of Yugoslavia, she allegedly said: \\"I'm not taking them - kill them\\" and the men were executed with a Heckler weapon. In response, Marinkoviƒá accused Kandiƒá of lying.

Los Angeles Times: p. B1. born March 19, 1959) is a former running back in the National Football League (NFL). He played with New Orleans Saints in 1981 and 1982. Born in Barstow, California, Tyler moved to Oceanside where he starred as halfback at El Camino High School. After receiving a number of awards following his senior season, he was recruited to the University of Washington, where he played mainly as a fullback. In his freshman season of 1977, the Huskies won the Rose Bowl, and he started for the first time in a game the following season, and took a larger role in his junior year in 1979 as the team went and won the Sun Bowl. Early in Tyler's senior season in 1980, injuries to the Huskies' halfbacks prompted head coach Don James to move him there from fullback. Washington finished in the regular season and won the Pac-10 title, earning them a trip to the Rose Bowl against the Michigan Wolverines. With the score tied at zero in the first quarter, Tyler fumbled at the one-yard line; Michigan went on to win the game 23‚Äì6. Tyler was selected 222nd overall (first in the ninth round) in the 1981 NFL Draft by the New Orleans Saints. He played two seasons with the Saints, appearing in all 23 games over those two seasons. Before the 1983 NFL season, the Saints cut him in order to meet the limit on how many players a team may have. He then went on to a short stint with the Oakland Invaders in the USFL, and then tried to make the Minnesota Vikings. He now lives in Kent, Washington, where he works as a juvenile detention officer.  Early life  Born on March 19, 1959, Tyler was named after the 18th-century Haitian leader Toussaint Louverture.\\"Rose Bowl won't decide national title this year\\". Lodi News- Sentinel: p. 13.

The running back later said \\"My father tried to interest me in boxing but I wasn't into getting smacked in the face.\\" Tyler, along with two brothers and four sisters, lived in Barstow, California until he was in seventh grade. His parents then divorced and he went to live with his mother in Oceanside, California. In Oceanside, he played at El Camino High School under coach Herb Meyer. Rushing for 1,732 yards with an eight yards-per-carry average in his senior season, the halfback drew comparisons to fellow El Camino back C. R. Roberts. The El Camino team won the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) district title in 1976. One of six Californians named to that year's All-American high school football team by Scholastic Coach, a magazine for athletic directors and coaches, he was San Diego County's player of the year and shared CIF (San Diego Section) player of the year honors with offensive tackle Curt Marsh. Both players were considered blue-chip recruits and went to the University of Washington.  College career  At Washington, Tyler was converted from halfback to fullback. Because of this, Tyler needed to learn how to block, a transition in which he said he \\"pinched a lot of nerves and got a lot of stiff necks\\". When asked during his senior year a Washington which position he prefers, Tyler responded \\"I love tailback, but I'll play any position to help our team.\\" Tyler finished third in a pre-season poll of sportswriters predicting the conference's offensive rookie of the year.Brown, Bruce (September 3, 1977). \\"Another View: Cougar Stars Boosted\\".

They then won the 1978 Rose Bowl 27‚Äì20 over the Michigan Wolverines. The following season, Tyler started at fullback for the first time in a game against Oregon State, winless at the time, and rushed for 151 yards, including a 55-yard fourth-quarter touchdown, to lead the Huskies to a 20‚Äì14 victory. In the team's next game, the back scored twice as Washington beat twelfth-ranked Arizona State. The Huskies finished with seven wins and four losses, missing a bowl game. Tyler averaged 5.5 yards a carry in the 1978 season. To begin 1979, Washington won 38‚Äì2 and 41‚Äì7 against non-conference opponents, with Tyler scoring once in both games and averaging 8.2 yards per carry.

This seal was probably introduced around 1300 and was in use for nearly three centuries. Due to its bad state of preservation, the image was later misinterpreted as the woman whom Hallvard tried to defend. After the Reformation, the city continued to use the seal with the image of St. Hallvard. The second seal of Oslo dates from around 1590. It shows the same basic design, but the saint holds his attributes in the opposite hands. Also, the stars and some other smaller details were lost. This seal was used until around 1660.Hohler, Erla Bergendahl. \\"St. Hallvard i Oslos bysegl\\". Byminner 1‚Äì1987, pp. 4‚Äì5 At that time the city of Oslo had been destroyed in the fire of 1624, and King Christian IV ordered its relocation across the bay and renamed it Christiania. The Cathedral Church of St. Hallvard barely survived the fire, but was later abandoned and used as a quarry. By 1660 it had become a ruin, and the legend of St. Hallvard was no longer well known. The third seal made in 1659, now that of the relocated city of Christiana, still showed the same basic design, but the saint was transformed into a female figure, probably now perceived as an embodiment of Christiania. She still held the arrows and had a dead knight (with harness and helmet) lying at her feet. The millstone had become thinner and looked more like a ring. A new feature of this seal was the motto of the city surrounding the circular motif, The female figure on the 1659 seal was reproduced as a motif on several cast iron stove plates produced by Norwegian iron foundries around 1770. These ovens found a large market in Denmark, and the female figure was by many Danes misinterpreted as the highly esteemed Queen Margaret I, who unified the three Kingdoms of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. The three arrows were interpreted as symbols of the three kingdoms, and the ring as a symbol of their union. The defeated knight was thought to symbolise her opponent, Albrecht of Mecklenburg. During the 18th and early 19th centuries, the image kept changing. The ring has been shown as a snake biting its own tail, the throne was replaced by a lion, and the warrior at Hallvard's feet definitely became a woman.Hals, Anna-Stina. \\"Fra Oslos segl til Christiania og Oslos v√•pen\\". Byminner 1‚Äì1987, pp. 12‚Äì14 In 1854, A.T. Kaltenborn wrote about the Norwegian municipal arms and also described the medieval seal of Oslo. He recognised it as depicting the legend of St. Hallvard, but did not interpret the reclining figure correctly. He persuaded the city to have a new seal designed, based on the alleged medieval composition. Finally, a new design was made by the German Emil Doepler in 1892. His composition was also transformed to fit onto an escutcheon, designed in 1899 by Reidar Haavin, at a time when many Norwegian towns adopted coats of arms. In 1924, the present design was made, still inside a circular seal, and still with the incorrect woman instead of the original warrior at the feet of St. Hallvard, but now stark naked. It was redesigned and its colors defined in 2000 as part of a new design program for Oslo.https://www.oslo.kommune.no/politikk-og-administrasjon/nedlastbare- maler/byvapenet/ The flag of Oslo, introduced in 2000, includes the seal placed towards the left on a blue background.Engene, Jan Oskar. \\"Nytt byflagg for Oslo?\\" Nordisk flaggkontakt 3‚Äì2000, pp. 31‚Äì33 References Category:Government and politics of Oslo ","title":"Coat of arms of Oslo"},{"id":"26878483","text":"Billabong High International School, Noida is a CBSE school located on a seven-acre campus in Sector 34, Noida, India.

He married twice and was the grandfather of the Mar√©chal de Soubise. His first wife was the daughter of Madame de Ventadour. He is known in contemporary texts as the prince de Rohan. Biography Born in Paris, he was the fourth of eleven children of Fran√ßois de Rohan and Anne Julie de Rohan, whose marriage gave rise to the Soubise line of the House of Rohan. His family claimed ancestry from the reigning Dukes of BrittanyBy the time of Hercule M√©riadec's birth, the Duchy of Burgundy had long been absorbed into the Kingdom of France which was then ruled by the House of Bourbon. Louis XIV was on the throne at the time of his birth and at the French court were allowed the rank of Foreign Prince. This entitled them to the style of Highness and other privileges at court. His mother was one-time mistress of Louis XIV. At the time, it was suspected that his younger brother Armand Gaston Maximilien de Rohan was in fact fathered by Louis XIV. Hercule M√©riadec's mother bought the Lordship of Soubise to the family, styling themselves as Prince. Anne Julie herself was Princess of Soubise suo jure. The second son, Hercule M√©riadec, became heir apparent in 1689 at the death of his elder brother Louis, who died aged 22. He was styled Prince of Maubuisson (prince de Maubuisson) till 1714 when he was made the Duke of Rohan-Rohan (as opposed to the Duke of Rohan, the title held by his cousins). He married twice, firstly to Anne Genevi√®ve de L√©vis, daughter of Louis Charles de L√©vis and Charlotte de La Motte Houdancourt (better known as Madame de Ventadour, governess of the young Louis XV). Anne Genevi√®ve had been widowed in 1692 having married Louis de La Tour d'Auvergne, son of Godefroy Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne and Marie Anne Mancini. He died in battle and she and Hercule M√©riadec were married in Paris on 15 February 1694. The marriage produced five children, three of whom would have progeny. He lost her only son Jules to smallpox in 1724 as well as his daughter in law Anne Julie de Melun. His grandson Charles, Prince of Soubise, was born in 1710 and after the death of his parents, was raised by Hercule M√©riadec himself to become a man of the court. Charles was later a great friend of Louis XV and the great-grandfather of the murdered Duke of Enghien through his eldest daughter Charlotte. His second daughter Charlotte Armande succeeded her aunt Anne Marguerite de Rohan as Abbess of Jouarre in 1721. Hercule M√©riadec was responsible for some interior d√©cor at the H√¥tel de Soubise engaging Germain Boffrand in the process. This dates from 1730 to 1740. He outlived his wife by 22 years; Anne Genevi√®ve died in March 1727. The widowed Hercule M√©riadec remarried on 2 September 1732 to Marie Sophie de Courcillon who was born in 1713 and had been a mistress of the famous womaniser Louis Fran√ßois Armand de Vignerot du Plessis. Marie Sophie was the daughter of Philippe Egon de Courcillon and Fran√ßoise de Pompadour, Duchesse de La Valette. She was also the granddaughter of Philippe de Courcillon, marquis de Dangeau, and Princess Sophia of L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Rochefort. He died in Paris on the Rue de Paradis.

Proposed by Lok Sang Ho of Lingnan University, Hong Kong, it was first intended to be the basis for denominating global bonds, a debt instrument that is issued globally and subscribable by people and institutions around the world. Since each unit by design represents a stable unit of purchasing power, the stipulated interest rate on WCU-denominated bonds represents a real interest rate. In principle, the common denomination of bonds by issuers from different parts of the world using the WCU, as well as the greater transparency of real interest rates, will produce more efficient capital markets, as savers and borrowers around the world converge in their understanding of what each basis point of interest means and are protected against two key sources of uncertainty, namely inflation and exchange loss risks. Irving Fisher in his 1911 book The Purchasing Power of Money had advised that, to serve as a unit of account, a trusted medium of exchange, and a reliable store of value, the purchasing power of money should be stable. Unfortunately, substances that exist by the bounty of nature, such as gold or silver, cannot have such property since their values fluctuate with changing supply and demand. This is the main motivation behind indexed units of account, of which Robert Shiller of Yale University is a principal proponent. To be meaningful in terms of stable global purchasing power, a WCU will have to represent a basket of global output. By definition, according to the initial proposal by Ho, the WCU represents the sum of the gross domestic products of key market economies in the world, namely the USA, the Eurozone and UK, Japan, Canada, and Australia. Addition of these GDPs, each in a separate currency, is done by converting all GDPs into US dollar values in the base year. The sum of these GDPs are then scaled down to equal $100 in the base year. The scaling factor then becomes part of the definition of the WCU, as it defines the size of the GDP basket. It is envisaged that every 5 or 10 years, the WCU can be rebased, with the new series using a new base year spliced to the old series much like consumer price indices with different base years are spliced to form a continuous series. The formula for the valuation of the World Currency Unit has been revised since 2008 so that the GDP weights are now revised every year. While still retaining the meaning of a unit of global real purchasing power, the WCU can now be interpreted as a GDP-weighted basket of currencies, each indexed against domestic inflation. The GDP-weighted basket of currencies has now formed the basis for a new formula for the effective exchange rate. The nominal value of this unit would rise with inflation in each economy. Moreover, the nominal value of this unit would rise if other currencies represented in the basket appreciate against the US dollar. Savers purchasing such bonds would not only enjoy protection against inflation, but would benefit from the diversification of exchange risks. The WCU could be used for the pricing of commodities such as oil, precious metals, and agricultural products, which are typically quoted in US dollars. Of course, historical prices of commodities quoted in US dollars could also be converted into prices in WCUs to provide indications on trends in the real prices of these commodities.

It is known from a partial juvenile skeleton, the holotype MH1, and a partial adult female skeleton, the paratype MH2. They date to about 1.98 million years ago in the Early Pleistocene, and coexisted with Paranthropus robustus and Homo ergaster/H. erectus. Malapa is interpreted as having been a natural death trap, the base of a long vertical shaft which creatures could accidentally fall into. A. sediba was initially described as being a potential human ancestor, and perhaps the progenitor of Homo, but this is contested and it could also represent a late-surviving population or sister species of A. africanus which had earlier inhabited the area. MH1 has a brain volume of about 420‚Äì440 cc, similar to other australopithecines. The face of MH1 is strikingly similar to Homo instead of other australopithecines, with a less pronounced brow ridge, cheek bones, and prognathism (the amount the face juts out), and there is evidence of a slight chin. However, such characteristics could be due to juvenility and lost with maturity. The teeth are quite small for an australopithecine. MH1 is estimated at tall, which would equate to an adult height of . MH1 and MH2 were estimated to have been about the same weight at . Like other australopithecines, A. sediba is thought to have had a narrow and apelike upper chest, but a broad and humanlike lower chest. Like other australopithecines, the arm anatomy seems to suggest a degree of climbing and arboreal behaviour. The pelvis indicates A. sediba was capable of a humanlike stride, but the foot points to a peculiar gait not demonstrated in any other hominin involving hyperpronation of the ankle, and resultantly rotating the leg inwards while pushing off. This suite of adaptations may represent a compromise between habitual bipedalism and arboreality. A. sediba seems to have eaten only C3 forest plants such as some grasses and sedges, fruits, leaves, and bark. This strongly contrasts from other early hominins which ate a mix of C3 and abundant C4 savanna plants, but is similar to modern savanna chimps. No other hominin bears evidence of eating bark. Such a generalist diet may have allowed it to occupy a smaller home range than savanna chimps. The Malapa area may have been cooler and more humid than today, featuring closed forests surrounded by more open grasslands. Research history=Specimens The first fossil find was a right clavicle, MH1 (UW88-1), in Malapa Cave, Cradle of Humankind, South Africa, discovered by 9-year-old Matthew Berger on 15 August 2008 while exploring the digsite headed by his father, South African palaeoanthropologist Lee Rogers Berger. Further excavation yielded a partial skeleton for MH1, additionally including a partial skull and jawbone fragments, as well as aspects of the arms, fingers, shoulders, ribcage, spine, pelvis, legs, and feet. MH1 is interpreted as having been a juvenile male due to the apparently pronounced development of the brow ridge and canine roots, eversion of the angle of the mandible, and large scarring on the bones. However, anthropologists William Kimbel and Yoel Rak contend that these are unreliable methods of determining sex, and suggest that MH1 is female based on the lack of anterior pillars (columns running down alongside the nasal opening down to around the mouth) and a slightly convex subnasal plate, using methods of sex determination for A. africanus. MH1 was nicknamed \\"Karabo,\\" which means \\"answer\\" in Tswana, by 17-year-old Omphemetse Keepile from St Mary's School, Johannesburg, in a naming contest. She chose this name because, \\"The fossil represents a solution towards understanding the origins of humankind.\\" Another partial skeleton, the adult MH2, was recovered by Lee on 4 September 2008 with isolated upper teeth, a partial jawbone, a nearly complete right arm, the right scapula, and fragments of the shoulders, right arm, spine, ribs, pelvis, knee joint, and feet. The pubic bone is broad and square, and the muscle scarring on the body is weak to moderate, which suggest that MH2 is female. The presence of species which evolved after 2.36 million years ago and became extinct around 1.5 million years ago indicates the A. sediba layer dates to sometime within this interval during the Early Pleistocene. Uranium‚Äìlead dating of a flowstone capping the layer yielded a date of 2.026¬±0.021 million years ago. Using archaeomagnetic dating, the sediments have a normal magnetic polarity (as opposed to the reverse of the magnetic polarity in modern day) and the only time when this occurred during this interval is between 1.95 and 1.78 million years ago. In 2011, the flowstone was more firmly dated to 1.977¬±0.002 million years ago again using uranium‚Äìlead dating. Taphonomy The cave networks around Malapa comprise long, interconnected cave openings within a area. The Malapa site may have been at the base of an at most cavern system. The cave is at the intersection of a north-northeast and north-northwest chert-filled fracture, and the hominin remains were unearthed in a section on the north-northwest fracture. The layer was exposed by limestone mining in the early 20th century. The cave comprises five sedimentary facies A‚ÄìE of water-laid sandstone, with A. sediba being recovered from facies D, and more hominin remains from facies E. MH1 and MH2 are separated vertically by at most . Facies D is a , lightly coloured layer overlying flowstone. Small peloids are common, but are fused into large and irregular groups, which indicate they were deposited in a water-logged setting. Peloids may represent faecal matter or soil microbes. The preservation state of MH1 and MH2 indicate they were deposited quickly, were moved very little, and were cemented soon after deposition in a phreatic environment (in a subterranean stream). There is no evidence of scavenging, indicating the area was inaccessible to carnivores. This could all indicate that Malapa Cave was a deathtrap, with inconspicuous cave openings at the surface. Animals may have been lured by the scent of water emanating from the shaft, and carnivores to the scent of dead animals, and then fallen to their deaths. A large debris flow caused the remains to be deposited deeper into the cave along a subterranean stream, perhaps due to a heavy rainstorm. The chamber eventually collapsed and filled with mud. Classification Reconstruction a largely hairless male A. sediba by Adrie and Alfons Kennis at the Neanderthal Museum, Germany In 2010, Lee and colleagues officially described the species Australopithecus sediba with MH1 as the holotype and MH2 the paratype. The species name \\"sediba\\" means \\"fountain\\" or \\"wellspring\\" in the local Sesotho language. Because A. sediba had many traits in common with Homo ergaster/H. erectus, particularly in the pelvis and legs, the describers postulated that A. sediba was a transitional fossil between Australopithecus and Homo. Dental traits are also suggestive of some close relationship between A. sediba and the ancestor of Homo. However, the specimens were found in a stratigraphic unit dating to 1.95‚Äì1.78 million years ago, whereas the earliest Homo fossils at the time dated to 2.33 million years ago (H. habilis from Hadar, Ethiopia). Currently, the oldest Homo specimen is LD 350-1 dating to 2.8‚Äì2.75 million years ago from Ledi-Geraru, Ethiopia. To reconcile the dating discrepancy, the describers also hypothesised that A. sediba evolved from a population of A. africanus (which inhabited the same general region) some time before the Malapa hominins, and that Homo split from A. sediba sometime thereafter. This would imply an 800,000 year ghost lineage between A. africanus and the Malapa hominins. It was also suggested that A. sediba, instead of H. habilis or H. rudolfensis, was the direct ancestor of H. ergaster/H. erectus (the earliest uncontested member of the genus Homo), primarily because the Malapa hominins were dated to 1.98 million years ago in 2011, which at the time predated the earliest representative of H. ergaster/H. erectus. A. sediba is now thought to have been contemporaneous with H. ergaster/H. erectus and Paranthropus robustus in the Cradle of Humankind. Alternatively, A. sediba could also represent a late-surviving morph or sister species of A. africanus unrelated to Homo, which would mean Homo-like traits evolved independently in A. sediba and Homo (homoplasy). The fossil record of early Homo is poorly known and based largely on fragmentary remains, making convincing anatomical comparisons difficult and sometimes unfeasible. A. africanus, A. afarensis, and A. garhi have also been proposed as the true ancestor of Homo, and the matter is much debated. Further, the holotype is a juvenile, which Kimbel and Rak cite in arguing that some of the Homo-like facial characteristics may have been lost with maturity. The present classification of australopithecines is in disarray. Australopithecus may be considered a grade taxon whose members are united by their similar physiology rather than close relations with each other over other hominin genera, and, for the most part, it is largely unclear how any species relates to the others. Anatomy=Skull Endocast of MH1 Only the cranial vault of MH1 was preserved, which has a volume of 363 cc. The very back of the brain is estimated to have been 7‚Äì10 cc. To estimate the cerebellum, the australopithecines KNM-ER 23000 (Paranthropus boisei) and Sts 19 (A. africanus) with volumes of 40‚Äì50 cc, as well as KNM-ER 1813 (H. habilis), KNM- ER 1805 (H. habilis), and KNM-ER 1470 (H. rudolfensis) with volumes of 55‚Äì75 cc were used to estimate the volume of the MH1 cerebellum as about 50 cc. Considering all these, MH1 may have had a brain volume of about 420‚Äì440 cc. This is typical for australopithecines. Using trends seen in modern primates between adult and neonate brain size, neonate brain size may have been 153‚Äì201 cc, similar to what is presumed for other australopithecines. Brain configuration appears to have been mostly australopithecine-like, but the orbitofrontal cortex appears to have been more humanlike. Overall, A. sediba skull anatomy is most similar to A. africanus. However, MH1 has a smaller cranium, a transversely wider cranial vault, more vertically-inclined walls of the parietal bone, and more widely spaced temporal lines. Much like Homo, the brow ridge is less pronounced, the cheekbones are less flared, the face does not jut out as far (less prognathism), and there is a slight chin. However, such characteristics are also found in some A. africanus skulls from Sterkfontein Member 4, which Kimbel and Rak believed could indicate that these Homo-like attributes would have been lost in maturity. Also, if prognathism is measured using the anterior nasal spine instead of the very base of the nose, prognathism in MH1 falls within the range of that seen in A. africanus. The teeth are quite small for an australopithecine, and are more within the range of those of early Homo. However, unlike Homo, the molars progressively increase in size towards the back of the mouth‚Äîas opposed to the second molar being the largest‚Äîand the cusps are more closely spaced together. Comparison of various hominins' jawbones (A. sediba leftmost) The shape of the mandibular ramus (the bar which connects the jaw to the skull) is quite different between MH1 and MH2. That of MH1 is taller and wider; the front and back border are nearly vertical and parallel, in contrast to the nonparallel borders of MH2 with a concave front border; and the coronoid process of MH1 is angled towards the back with a deep and asymmetrical mandibular notch, whereas MH2 has an uncurved coronoid process with a shallow mandibular notch. Compared to patterns seen in modern great apes, such marked differences exceed what would be expected if these could be explained as due to sexual dimorphism or the juvenile status of MH1. Skeletally, A. sediba may have been a highly variable species. Torso MH1 (left), MH2 (right), and A. afarensis Lucy (centre) MH1 is tall MH1 and MH2 were estimated to have been roughly the same size, about . This is smaller than many contemporary hominins, but reasonable for an australopithecine. MH1 was about tall, but he was a juvenile at about the same skeletal development of a 12-year-old human child or a 9-year-old chimp. A. sediba, much like earlier and contemporary hominins, appears to have had an apelike growth rate based on dental development rate, so MH1 may have reached about 85% of its adult size assuming a chimplike growth trajectory, or 80% assuming a humanlike trajectory. This would equate to roughly . MH1 preserves 4 neck, 6 thoracic, and 2 lumbar vertebrae; and MH2 preserves 2 neck, 7 thoracic, 2 lumbar, and 1 sacral vertebrae. The lordosis (humanlike curvature) and joints of the neck vertebrae, indicating similar head posture to humans. However, the overall anatomy of the neck vertebrae is apelike, and point to a much stiffer neck. A. sediba lacks a humanlike brachial plexus (which is identified in some A. afarensis), and the human brachial plexus is responsible for nerves and muscle innervation in the arms and hands enhancing motor control. Like humans, A. sediba appears to have had a flexible lumbar series comprising 5 vertebrae‚Äîas opposed to 6 static vertebrae in non-human apes‚Äîand exhibiting lumbar lordosis (human curvature of the spine) consistent with habitual upright posture. However, A. sediba seems to have had a highly mobile lower back and exaggerated lumbar lordosis, which may have been involved in counteracting torques directed inwards while walking in the hyperpronating gait proposed for A. sediba. MH1 preserves 2 upper thoracic, 1 mid-thoracic, and 3 lower thoracic ribs; and MH2 4 consecutive upper-to-mid-thoracic, and 3 lower thoracic ribs joined with the vertebrae. This indicates that A. sediba had an apelike constricted upper chest, but the humanlike anatomy of the pelvis may suggest A. sediba had a broad and humanlike lower chest. The narrow upper chest would have hindered arm swinging while walking, and would have restricted the rib cage and prevented heavy breathing and thereby fast walking or long-distance running. In contrast, A. sediba seems to have had a humanlike narrow waist, repositioned abdominal external oblique muscles, and wider iliocostalis muscles on the back, which all would improve walking efficiency by counteracting sideward flexion of the torso. Reconstructed MH2 pelvis The pelvis shares several traits with early Homo and H. ergaster, as well as KNM- ER 3228 from Koobi Fora, Kenya, and OH 28 from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, which are unassigned to a species (though generally are classified as Homo spp.) There was more buttressing along the acetabulum and sacrum improving hip extension, enlargement of the iliofemoral ligament attachment shifting the weight behind the centre of rotation of the hip, more buttressing along the acetabulum and iliac blade improving alternating pelvic tilt, and more distance between the acetabulum and the ischial tuberosity reducing moment arm at the hamstrings. This may have allowed a humanlike stride in A. sediba. The hip joint appears to have had a more humanlike pattern of load bearing than the H. habilis specimen OH 62. The birth canal of A. sediba appears to be more gynaecoid (the normal human condition) than those of other australopiths which are more platypelloid, though A. sediba is not completely gynaecoid which may be due to smaller neonate brain (and thus head) size. Like humans, the birth canal had increased diameter sagittally (from front to back) and the pubis bone curled upwards. Upper limbs Palmar view of the hand and forearm of MH2 Like other australopithecines and early Homo, A. sediba had somewhat apelike upper body proportions with relatively long arms, a high brachial index (forearm to humerus ratio) of 84, and large joint surfaces. It is debated if apelike upper limb configuration of australopithecines is indicative of arboreal behaviour or simply is a basal trait inherited from the great ape last common ancestor in the absence of major selective pressures to adopt a more humanlike arm anatomy. The shoulders are in a shrugging position, the shoulder blade has a well developed axillary border, and the conoid tubercle (important in muscle attachment around the shoulder joint) is well defined. Muscle scarring patterns on the clavicle indicate a humanlike range of motion. The shoulder blade is most similar to that of orangutans in terms of the size of the glenoid cavity (which forms the shoulder joint) and its angle with the spine, though the shape of the shoulder blade is most similar to humans and chimps. The humerus has a low degree of torsion unlike humans and African apes, which (along with the short clavicle) suggests the shoulder blade was placed farther from the midline like in Homo, though it is positioned higher up the back like in other australopithecines. The apelike qualities of the arms are apparently more marked in A. sediba than the more ancient A. afarensis, and if A. afarensis is ancestral to A. sediba, this could indicate an adaptive shift towards arboreal behaviour. At the elbow joint, the lateral and medial epicondyles of the humerus are elongated, much like other australopithecines and non-human African apes. The humerus also sports a developed crest at the elbow joint to support the brachioradialis muscle which flexes the forearm. Like non-human African apes, there is a strong attachment for the biceps on the radius and for the triceps on the ulna. However, there is less mechanical advantage for the biceps and brachialis. The ulna also supports strong attachment for the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. The olecranon fossa is large and deep and there is a prominent trochlear keel, which are important in maintaining stability in the arms while they are extended. The finger bones are long, robust, and curved, and support strong flexor digitorum superficialis muscles important for flexing the fingers. These are sometimes argued as evidence of arboreal behaviour in australopithecines. The hand also features a relatively long thumb and short fingers, much like Homo, which could suggest a precision grip important in creating and using complex stone tools. Lower limbs matrix adhering to the bone in red) Like other australopithecines, the ankle, knee, and hip joints indicate habitual bipedalism. The leg bones are quite similar to those of A. afarensis. The ankle is mostly humanlike with perhaps a humanlike Achilles tendon. The talus bone is stout and more like those of non-human apes, and features a medially twisted neck and a low neck torsion angle. It is debated if A. sediba had a humanlike foot arch or if the foot was more apelike. The heel bone is angled at a 45-degree angle, and is markedly angled from the front to the back, most strongly at the peroneal trochlea. The robust peroneal trochlea indicates strong peroneus muscles which extend through the calf to the ankle. The foot lacks the lateral plantar tubercle (which may be involved in dissipate forces when the heel hits the ground in a normal human gait) seen in humans and A. afarensis. The gracile body of the heel bone and the robust malleolus (the bony prominence on each side of the ankle) are quite apelike, with less efficient force transfer between the heel bone and the talus, and apelike mobility at the midfoot. A. sediba is most similar to the condition seen in gorillas, and the foot may have been functionally equivalent to that of A. africanus. Palaeobiology=Diet Analysis of phytoliths (microscopic plant remains) from the dental plaque of both specimens and carbon isotope analysis shows a diet of almost exclusively C3 forest plants despite a presumably wide availability of C4 plants in their mixed savanna environment. Such a feeding pattern is also observed in modern savanna chimps and is hypothesised for the Early Pliocene Ardipithecus ramidus, but is quite different from any other early hominin. A total of 38 phytoliths were recovered from two teeth from MH1, of which 15 are consistent with dicots, 9 monocots, and the other 14 indeterminate. The monocots were probably sourced from C3 grasses and sedges growing in well-watered and shady areas, and other phytoliths were sourced from fruit, leaves, and wood or bark. Though bark is commonly eaten by other primates for its high protein and sugar content, no other hominin is known to have consumed bark regularly. Dental microwearing analysis similarly suggests the two Malapa hominins ate hard foods, complexity values ranging between H. erectus and the robust P. robustus. Nonetheless, the jaw does not appear to have been as well adapted for producing high strains compared to other early hominins, which may indicate A. sediba was not as highly dependent on its ability to process mechanically challenging food. The interpretation of A. sediba as a generalist herbivore of C3 forest plants is consistent with it being at least partially arboreal. Such a broad diet may have allowed A. sediba to have occupied much smaller home ranges than modern savanna chimps which predominantly consume only fruit, as A. sediba was able to fall back on bark and other fracture-resistant foods. Gait Ankle positions in a human right foot (hyperpronation on the left) While walking, A. sediba may have displayed hyperpronation of the ankle joint causing exaggerated transfer of weight inwards during stance phase. For modern human hyperpronaters, the foot is highly inverted during the swing phase, and contact with the ground is first made by the outer border of the foot, causing high torques rotating the entire leg inwards. Similarly, the attachments for the rectus femoris and biceps femoralis muscles in A. sediba are consistent with midline-directed strains across the legs, hips, and knees. This mode of walking is unideal for modern human anatomy, and hyperpronaters are at a higher risk of developing plantar fasciitis, shin splints, and tibial stress fractures. To counteract this, A. sediba may have made use of a mobile midfoot as opposed to a stiff humanlike midfoot, which may have prevented overly stressful loading of the ankle. The hyperpronating gait and related suite of adaptations have not been identified in other hominins, and it is unclear why A. sediba would develop this. A mobile midfoot would also be beneficial in extensive climbing behaviour, so hyperpronation may have been a compromise between habitual bipedalism and arboreality. Birth Reconstruction of an A. sediba neonate entering the pelvic inlet (A and B) and the midplane without rotation (C) The pelvic inlet for a female A. sediba is estimated to have been long x broad (sagittal x transverse), and since the neonate head size is estimated to have been at longest, the neonate probably entered the pelvic inlet transversely orientated similar to other hominins. The midplane of the pelvic inlet is constricted to a minimum of , so the neonate may not have needed to be rotated while being birthed. Pelvic inlet dimensions were calculated using a composite reconstruction involving the juvenile male ischium; likewise, the birth canal was possibly actually larger than calculated. The shoulders are estimated to have been across, so they would not have obstructed birth more than the head would have. Therefore, the neonate would have occupied, at the point of most constriction, about 92.1% of the birth canal, allowing sufficient room for a completely non-rotatonal birth as is exhibited in non-human apes and possibly other australopithecines (though a semi-rotational birth is also proposed). Though it is possible to pass without any rotation, the midplane expands anteroposteriorly (from front to back), and there would have been more space for the neonate if it rotated so that the longest length of the head lined up with this expansion. Modern humans, in comparison, have a much more laborious and complex birth requiring full rotation of the neonate, as the large brain and thus head size, as well as the rigid shoulders, of the human neonate make it much more difficult to fit through the birth canal. Using an estimate of 145.8‚Äì180.4 cc for A. sediba neonate brain size, neonate head size would have been , similar to a chimp neonate. Development Predicted bone growth patterns in MH1 (A and B) and A. africanus/A. afarensis (C) Growth trajectory seems to have been noticeably different in MH1 than other hominins. The nasomaxillary (bone from the nose to the upper lip) complex indicates a great degree of bone resorption, most markedly at the tooth roots of the front teeth. This contrasts with A. africanus and A. afarensis which are depository, reflecting increasing prognathism with age. P. robustus also features resorption of the upper jaw, but resorption in MH1 expands along the front teeth to the canine fossa near the cheek bones, resulting in a mesognathic (somewhat protrusive) face, as opposed to a flat face in P. robustus. Because resorption occurs so close to the cheek bones, this may explain why MH1 does not present flaring cheekbones characteristic of A. africanus. Tooth eruption probably did not affect the remodeling of the lower face as MH1 already had all of its permanent teeth. Nonetheless, smaller cheek tooth size may have permitted a mesognathic face. The modern day olive colobus monkey may have had a similar diet to A. sediba (which markedly contrasts with typical early hominin diets), and appears to have similar patterns of facial-bone growth, which may indicate diverging resorptions and deposition patterns in A. sediba from other hominins reflects different jaw-loading patterns. The margins of the eye sockets of MH1 are curved, whereas they are indented in A. africanus, which may indicate bone deposition in A. sediba in regions where bone resorption occurs in A. africanus. Pathology Tumour of MH1 in pink The right lamina of the sixth thoracic vertebra of MH1 presents a penetrating bone tumour, probably a benign osteoid osteoma. The lesion penetrates deep and is wide, and was still active at the time of death. It did not penetrate the neural canal so it probably did not cause any neurological complications, and there is no evidence of scoliosis (abnormal curving of the spine). It may have affected movement of the shoulder blade and the upper right quadrant of the back, perhaps causing acute or chronic pain, muscular disturbances, or muscle spasms. Given A. sediba may have required climbing ability, the lesion's position near the insertion for the trapezius, erector spinae, and rhomboid major muscles may have limited normal movement patterns. MH1 has the earliest diagnosed case of cancer for a hominin by at least 200,000 years, predating the 1.8- to 1.6-million-year-old SK 7923 metatarsal fragment presenting osteosarcoma from Swartkrans, Cradle of Humankind. Tumours are rare in the hominin fossil record, likely due to low incidence rate in general for primates; early hominins likely had the same incidence rates as modern primates. The juvenile MH1 developing a bone tumour is consistent with the general trend of bone tumours mostly occurring in younger individuals. MH1 and MH2 exhibit perimortem (around the time of death) bone injuries consistent with blunt force trauma. This agrees with the interpretation of the site as the base of a tall shaft, acting as a natural death trap that animals accidentally fell into. MH1 and MH2 may have fallen about onto a sloping pile of gravel, sand, and bat guano, which probably cushioned the fall to some degree. For MH1, perimortem fracturing is most prominent on the jawbone and teeth, though it is possible that these injuries derived from being hit with a falling object in addition to the fall itself. MH2 bears evidence of bracing during injury, with loading to the forearm and hand and impact to the chest, perimortem fracturing identified on the right side of the body. These are the first deaths in the australopith fossil record confidently not ascribed to predation or natural causes. Palaeoecology Afromontane biome in the Magaliesberg mountain range A total of 209 non-hominin fossils were recovered alongside the hominins in facies D and E in 2010, and taxa identified from these are: the sabre-toothed cat Dinofelis barlowi, the leopard, the African wild cat, the black-footed cat, the brown hyena, the cape fox, the mongooses Atilax mesotes and Mungos, a genet, an African wild dog, a horse, a pig, a klipspringer, a Megalotragus antelope, a large alcelaphine antelope, a relative of the harnessed bushbuck, a relative of the greater kudu, and a hare. Today, the black-footed cat and cape fox are endemic to South African grass-, bush-, and scrublands. Similarly, the brown hyena inhabits dry, open habitats and has never been reported in a closed forest setting. Dinofelis and Atilax, on the other hand, are generally indicators of a closed, wet habitat. This may indicate the area featured a closed habitat as well as grasslands‚Äîjudging by the home range of the cape fox, both existed within of the site. The coprolite of a carnivore from facies D contained pollen and phytoliths of Podocarpus or Afrocarpus trees, as well as wood fragments from unidentified conifers and dicots. No phytoliths from grasses were found. In modern day, the Malapa site is a grassland, and Podocarpus and Afrocarpus are found away in the Afromontane forest biome in the canyons above sea level in the Magaliesberg mountain range, where wildfires are less common. This may indicate that Malapa was a cooler, more humid area than today, allowing for enough fire reduction to allow such forest plants to spread that far beyond naturally sheltered areas. Malapa during the Early Pleistocene may have also been at a somewhat lower elevation than today, with valleys and Magaliesberg being less pronounced. Australopithecines and early Homo likely preferred cooler conditions than later Homo, as there are no australopithecine sites that were below in elevation at the time of deposition. This would mean that, like chimps, they often inhabited areas with an average diurnal temperature of , dropping to at night. Malapa Cave is currently above sea level. A. sediba lived alongside P. robustus and H. ergaster/H. erectus. Because A. africanus went extinct around this time, it is possible that South Africa was a refugium for Australopithecus until about 2 million years ago with the beginning of major climatic variability and volatility, and potentially competition with Homo and Paranthropus.

The terms \\"pipe\\" and \\"tube\\" are almost interchangeable, although minor distinctions exist -- generally, a tube has tighter engineering requirements than a pipe. Both pipe and tube imply a level of rigidity and permanence, whereas a hose is usually portable and flexible. A tube and pipe may be specified by standard pipe size designations, e.g., nominal pipe size, or by nominal outside or inside diameter and/or wall thickness. The actual dimensions of pipe are usually not the nominal dimensions: A 1-inch pipe will not actually measure 1 inch in either outside or inside diameter, whereas many types of tubing are specified by actual inside diameter, outside diameter, or wall thickness.  Manufacture  There are three classes of manufactured tubing: seamless, as-welded or electric resistant welded (ERW), and drawn- over-mandrel (DOM). * Seamless tubing is produced via extrusion or rotary piercing. * Drawn-over-mandrel tubing is made from cold-drawn electrical- resistance-welded tube that is drawn through a die and over a mandrel to create such characteristics as dependable weld integrity, dimensional accuracy, and an excellent surface finish.  Standards  There are many industry and government standards for pipe and tubing. Many standards exist for tube manufacture; some of the most common are as follows: *ASTM A213 Standard Specification for Seamless Ferritic and Austenitic Alloy-Steel Boiler, Superheater, Heat-Exchanger Tubes. *ASTM A269 Standard Specification for Seamless and Welded Austenitic Stainless Steel Tubing for General Service *ASTM A270 Standard Specification for Seamless and Welded Austenitic Stainless Steel Sanitary Tubing *ASTM A511 Standard Specification for Seamless Stainless Steel Mechanical Tubing *ASTM A513 Standard Specification for Electric- Resistance-Welded Carbon and Alloy Steel Mechanical Tubing *ASTM A554 Standard Specification for Welded Stainless Steel Mechanical Tubing *British Standard 1387:1985 Specification for screwed and socketed steel tubes and tubulars and for plain end steel tubes suitable for welding or for screwing to BS 21 pipe threads ASTM material specifications generally cover a variety of grades or types that indicate a specific material composition. Some of the most commonly used are: *TP 304 *TP 316 *MT 304 *MT 403 *MT 506 In installations using hydrogen, copper and stainless steel tubing must be factory pre-cleaned (ASTM B 280) and/or certified as instrument grade.

History =First Churches The first church was built around the 1000 AD. Near the beginning of the 13th century, a cathedral was built under the supervision of Bishop Bruno II. The Bishop established the Catholic priest foundation at this time as well. This first cathedral was not specifically the Cathedral of St. Peter, as both John the Baptist and St. Peter were the patron saints for the church.http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/USTxW- SA8IDsNQh4IzC90w?feat=directlink Modern Cathedral Between 1456 and 1463, the cathedral that now stands was constructed and named after St. Peter. A fourth nave was added to the original structure. A fire decimated much of the city and church in 1634, and the church required a new vault and significant restoration work. The entire interior of the church, with the exception of the original Gothic-style which can still be seen today. Various cities came to Bautzen to help rebuild the city and Cathedral. Names of many Germanic cities are written on the lintels in the church to commemorate the rebuilding of the cathedral. The church is a mixture of several different architectural styles, the most prominent being Gothic and Baroque. The early church was entirely a Gothic structure, but it has since been heavily modified. Today, only parts of the interior are Gothic in nature. The Baroque dome was added to the tower in 1664.:de:Dom St. Petri (Bautzen) Simultaneum Era In 1523, an Evangelical Lutheran started preaching in the church. Since 1530, both Catholics and Lutherans have shared the building. A 4-meter (12 ft) tall screen separated the sanctuary. In 1567 the Holy See separated the Lusatian areas outside Saxony from the Saxon parts of the ancient Meissen diocese and established there the Prefecture Apostolic of Meissen, seated at St. Peter's of Bautzen, with Johannes Leisentritt as its first prefect.Cf. \\"Diocese of Dresden- Meissen: Historical Details\\" on: The Hierarchy of the Catholic Church: Current and historical information about its bishops and dioceses (Catholic Hierarchy), retrieved on 1 April 2011. In canon law an apostolic prefecture is a diocese on approval. According to its location and its seat the prefecture used to be called alternatively the Apostolic Prefecture of the Two Lusatias (Upper and Lower Lusatia) or Apostolic Prefecture of Bautzen. In 1583, the dean of the cathedral, Leisentrit, ordered that a contract be made between the two sects defining when each would be able to use the cathedral, among other details. This contract is still in effect today and has been only interrupted a few times in history, such as the Bohemian Uprising of 1620 that expelled the Catholics from the building for a short time. On 24 June 1921 Pope Benedict XV elevated the Apostolic Prefecture of Mei√üen to the new Diocese of Mei√üen by his apostolic constitution Sollicitudo omnium ecclesiarum and thus St. Peter's became the cathedral of that diocese.Cf. \\"Diocese of Dresden- Meissen\\", on: Catholic Hierarchy, retrieved on 8 February 2011. The 1743-founded Apostolic Vicariate in the Saxon Hereditary Lands was dissolved and its area and institutions integrated into the new Mei√üen diocese in 1921. In 1980 the seat of the diocese was moved to Dresden, leading the diocese to be renamed Dresden-Meissen, and St. Peter's becoming the co-cathedral, besides the Trinity Cathedral in Dresden. Today, Catholic and Lutheran altars are located on separate sides of the sanctuary. The Catholic high-altar was built in 1723. It was designed by a student of Balthasar Permoser, the same man that designed the Zwinger in Dresden. The altar murals were painted by the Venetian painter Pellegrini.http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/-FRkMqxaO1nTrlmQcq- wgQ?feat=directlink References Peter Bautzen Peter's Bautzen Peter's Bautzen Bautzen Category:Churches completed in 1463 ","title":"Cathedral of St Peter, Bautzen"},{"id":"26878691","text":"The Brave Archer and His Mate, also known as The Brave Archer 4 and Mysterious Island, is a 1982 Hong Kong film adapted from Louis Cha's novels The Legend of the Condor Heroes and The Return of the Condor Heroes.

As the northernmost outpost of the Saale- Unstrut wine region, it is the most northern registered location for QbA quality wine in Germany.Fr√∂hlich, p. 69.  Location, climate and soil  The Wachtelberg (German for \\"quail's mountain\\") is located on a 60 m high hill east of the River Havel shaped in the last ice age. The ridge is a remnant of a terminal moraine, formed in the Weichselian glaciation of the last glacial period. There is a temperate climate on the Werderaner Wachtelberg, affected by the Atlantic climate from the north and west and a continental climate from the east. Weather extremes are not commonplace. The temperature profile around Werder is similar to the national average for Germany. Seasonal temperature fluctuations are smaller than the usual continental climate, but higher than in the balanced maritime climate of coastal regions. Precipitation is, with an annual sum of 519 mm, also relatively small. The area is surrounded by the Schwielowsee, Gro√üer Zernsee and the Glindow-See, and due to its positioning between these vast lakes, a slightly higher than German-average temperature is often measured. The peculiarity of the vineyard is that the vines grow in slightly argillaceous sand soil. This sandy soil produces mild wines with low acidity. In 1991, the vineyard was affiliated as a single vineyard site (\\"gro√ülagenfreie Einzellage\\") by the wine growing region of Saale-Unstrut and thus recognized by the EU. The Wachtelberg is now a classified German vineyard and can be found under the registration 11.1.5.-017 in the vineyard register (Weinbergrolle). All Werderaner wines are pressed and vinificated at the Landesweingut Kloster Pforta in Saxony-Anhalt.  Viticulture introduction to the Margraviate of Brandenburg  The introduction of viticulture in the Margraviate of Brandenburg was part of the German eastward expansion, which was started in 1125 by King Lothair III. As a result of this policy, Albert the Bear established his rule in Brandenburg some 25 years later. Historical studies have shown that a wine culture was introduced to Brandenburg from the West.Fr√∂hlich, p. 26. This introduction is part of a west-east spread of viticulture in the Middle Ages in connection with the extension of Frankish and German domination and the spread of Christianity in Europe.Fr√∂hlich, p. 12. During the whole period of the Middle Ages, the Roman Catholic Church and its monasteries were sponsors of the wine culture in the margraviate. The church promoted wineries because wine was used for Holy Communion. In addition to the Franks and the Flemish settlers, it was the Cistercians who played a decisive role in viticulture around the Havel at the time. This must be regarded as the origins for the vineyard in Werder.

It is situated within the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site. The Malapa fossil site, viewed from the South, August 2011, Malapa Nature Reserve, South Africa History of investigations In March 2008, Lee Berger of the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, undertook an exploration project in the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage site outside of Johannesburg, in order to map the known caves identified by him and his colleagues over the past several decades, and to place known fossil sites onto Google Earth so that information could be shared with colleagues. The area is important as nearly a third of the entire evidence for human origins in Africa comes from just a few sites in this region, and the region is arguably one of the most explored areas in Africa for evidence of human origins, having been investigated continuously since the first discoveries were made there in 1935. At the beginning of this project, there were approximately 130 known cave sites in the region and around twenty fossil deposits. By July 2008, the pattern of cave distribution seen on Google Earth by Berger as well as the recognition of what these deposits looked like from satellites and significant amounts of searching on the ground had led Berger to discover almost 500 caves that scientists had not plotted or identified previously. Included in this were more than 25 fossil sites that had been unknown to science, all in probably the most explored region in Africa. Berger brought in geologist Paul Dirks, at that time Head of the School of GeoSciences at the University of the Witwatersrand, to lead the geological aspects of this exploratory project. In late July, Berger noted in Google Earth a series of caves running along a fault that pointed to a blank area in the region, an area that appeared to have clusters of trees that typically marked cave deposits. On 1 August he dropped off Dirks to map the recognized cave system and proceeded into the uninvestigated area with his dog Tau, a Rhodesian Ridgeback who accompanied him on almost all his explorations. Almost immediately he discovered a rich fossil site that was unknown to science, in the vicinity of more than three dozen caves that had been apparently unrecognized by previous researchers. A view of the Malapa valley, Malapa Nature Reserve, South Africa in 2012. The Malapa site is in the valley below the hill. On 15 August, Berger returned to the site with his post- doctoral student, Dr. Job Kibii, and Berger's 9-year-old son Matthew. Within minutes, Matthew Berger had discovered the first remains of early human ancestors - a clavicle, or collar bone. On the opposite side of the block, Berger quickly discovered a jawbone with a canine tooth of a hominid. The find was later identified as part of a partial skeleton of a juvenile hominid, around 9 ‚Äì 13 years of age. On 4 September 2008, Berger returned to the site with more than a dozen colleagues, where Berger discovered a second partial skeleton of an adult female. Recovered fossils The site has produced arguably one of the most complete assemblages of early human ancestors ever found, including the most complete skeletons of early hominids yet discovered, and by far the most complete remains of any hominid dating to around 2 million years ago. Over 200 elements have been recovered to date. The partial skeletons are initially described in two papers in the journal Science by Berger and colleagues as a new species of early human ancestor called Australopithecus sediba (sediba meaning natural spring or well in Sotho). In addition to the fossils revealed initially, rocks collected from the site have been examined with CT scans and contain even more bones, suggesting that the type specimen, Karabo, will become even more complete. The species is suggested by the authors to be a good candidate for being the transitional species between the southern African ape-man Australopithecus africanus (the Taung Child, Mrs. Ples) and either Homo habilis or even a direct ancestor of Homo erectus (Turkana boy, Java man, Peking man). The species has long arms, like an ape, short powerful hands, a very advanced pelvis, and long legs capable of striding and possibly running like a human. The skeletons were found among the articulated skeletons of a sabre-toothed cat, antelopes and even mice and hares. Geology The fossils are preserved in a hard, concrete-like substance known as calcified clastic sediments that formed at the bottom of what appears to be a shallow underground lake or pool that was possibly as much as underground at the time. It is not known how these skeletons came to be in this pool, but it appears that they may have taken a significant fall. No carnivores or scavengers reached their bodies. Age of the deposits The fossil was dated using a combination of paleomagnetism and uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating by Andy Herries (La Trobe University, Australia), Robyn Pickering (University of Melbourne, Australia) and Jan Kramers (University of Johannesburg, South Africa). U-Pb dating of the underlying flowstone indicates that the fossils are not older than 2.0 million years old. The occurrence of species of animal that became extinct ~1.5 million years ago indicate the deposit is not younger than 1.5 million years old. The sediments have a 'normal' magnetic polarity, and the only major period between 2.0 and 1.5 million years ago when this occurred was the Olduvai sub-Chron between 1.95 and 1.78 million years ago, and so in 2010 the fossil was suggested to be around 1.95 million years old based on the transitional nature of some of the sediments and the stratigraphy at the site. In 2011 a more accurate date of the fossils was established when a capping flowstone was too old to enable the normal polarity deposits to date to the Olduvai event. The deposits were instead correlated to a ~3000 year long period centred at around 1.977 million years ago and known as the Pre-Olduvai event.

During the first day of the campaign no e-mail confirmation was required by Ezhednevnyi Zhurnal. The site PutinaVotstavku did require a confirmation, but signatures were added automatically. This was used by ill-wishers, who left a large number of fake signatures, calling themselves Obama, Timoshenko, Medvedev, Putin etc. On 11 March these \\"signatures\\" were deleted and the process of adding new signatures began to be moderated. Course of the campaign During the first month of the campaign the number of signatures grew at the average rate of about 1000 per day. In late summer the speed of signature collection dropped to about 2000 per month. In December 2010 it increased to about 4000. *16 March 2010: 10,000 *27 March: 20,000 *9 April: 30,000 *28 April: 40,000 *14 June: 50,000 *1 October: 60,000 *6 January 2011: 70,000 * 12 March: 70,000 * 6 June: 90,000 On 17 March the United Civil Front started to hold pickets in Moscow in support of the campaign. Since May 2010 several organisers of the campaign have held meetings with supporters in a number of Russian cities. On 23 October, 12 December 2010 and 19 February 2011 rallies were held in central Moscow for Putin's dismissal. March 2010 On 15 March the site PutinaVotstavku started giving updates on the progress of the campaign. The first message said that the number of signatures could have been larger, if confirmations from the site had not been blocked by some popular e-mail services. However, the organisers expressed a belief that no counteraction would stop people and the appeal would be signed by millions of citizens. Valeria Novodvorskaya's signature was added only a week later, after her two video-addresses to the organisers. In them she expressed her displeasure with the delay and supposed that organisers did want to include her and Konstantin Borovoy's signatures. Konstantin Borovoy's signature was added only on 5 April. In his blog entry of 16 March the politician attributed this delay to the fact that he and Novodvorskaya were not allowed to join the Solidarity movement. He expressed a hope that it was a misunderstanding and asked Garry Kasparov and Boris Nemtsov to settle the issue with the Solidarity membership. Starting on 17 March, members of the United Civil Front held pickets in Moscow, some of them in dormitory districts, to collect signatures for the petition. Paper signatures were also collected during the protest actions on 20 March 2010 (the \\"Day of Wrath\\"). In particular, members of Solidarity collected signatures at rallies in Moscow and St. Petersburg. On 22 March organisers announced the creation of two online communities for those who signed the petition‚Äîon LiveJournal (putinvotstavku.livejournal.com) and Twitter (twitter.com/putinavotstavku/). They also proposed to discuss the creation of a separate social network in which every signatory would automatically get an account. On 26 March, during a press-conference organized by the site's editorial board, Garry Kasparov announced that the petition had been signed by about 30 thousand people‚Äîwith 19 thousand having been approved by the moderators. During that March the website developed rapidly with the creation of a campaign banner (with a counter), banners of media partners (Grani.ru, Novaya Gazeta, Kasparov.ru, etc.), links to campaign communities in social networks, as well as a form for filling in signatures offline. The sections News, Publications, Selected (signatures), Video and FAQ were added as well. April 2010 In April the already-created sections of the site were being filled in. Also a Facebook group was added. On 13 April the signatories received an e-mail message in which the organisers informed them about the creation of a social network. The message contained a web link to receive a newsletter and join the internet community, \\"Putin must go.\\" On 28 April the organisers announced that a third of the signatories had confirmed interest in joining the social network. They also discussed the plan to create groups of participants on the site and to also then visit cities in which a certain number of participants were located. May 2010 At the May Day rally in Moscow Garry Kasparov declared that the campaign would go on until Putin leaves and Russia becomes free. On 12 May the first meeting of signatories took place in Moscow, attended by about 70 people. Several leaders of Solidarnost, including Garry Kasparov, were also present. Advertising of the site Putinavotstavku using Google was started and account numbers for donations were published on the main page of the site. June 2010 On 14 June Boris Nemtsov and Vladimir Milov presented their report, \\"Putin. Results. 10 years\\",English translation: chapters 1 and 2, chapter 3, chapter 4 which was published with a total print run of 1 million copies. On its last page it provided information about the \\"Putin must go\\" campaign. They were distributed the same day near Moscow's metro stations.

Yashin was sentenced to a fine of 1000 roubles for \\"coarse language in a public place\\". Other pickets went without incidents. December 2010The rally of 12 December= The second Moscow rally for Putin's resignation was held under the motto \\"I am for Russia without Putin!\\" on 12 December on the same place ‚Äì Pushkin square. The mayor's office sanctioned this rally but refused to sanction the action \\"Day of Wrath\\" against the Moscow government, which was to be held on a neighbouring square immediately after the anti-Putin rally. The organiser was again the Committee of Five Demands. According to various sources, the rally was attended by 1500 ‚Äì 2500 people.

However, after an appeal of the Left Front coordinator Sergei Udaltsov to the participants to go without slogans and banners to the mayor's office in order to hang on its wall the list of demands, the police started to push away the crowd and seized Udaltsov. Among the aggrieved was a photographer of Izvestia, whose clavicle was broken. The indignant participants went to the mayor's house on their own, where they held an unsanctioned protest action. Udaltsov was sentenced to 15 days of arrest \\"for hooliganism and disobedience to police officers\\". The next rally for Putin's dismissal was planned for 19 February 2011. =Other events= On 18 December in Voronezh a rally was held for the dismissal of Putin's government. Among the speakers was a leader of Solidarity Ilya Yashin. On 26 December, a few days before passing a new sentence to the imprisoned Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, activists of Oborona unrolled near the White House a banner \\"Freedom to Khodorkovsky! Put Putin on bread and water!\\". One of the participants bore Putin's mask and was held in a mock cage. After a few minutes agents of Federal Protective Service detained several journalists and photo correspondents. January 2011 On 11 January 2011 the website was completely moved to the domain .org. On the start page of the old address the organisers published a message, containing a link to the new address. In the message they state that at the new address they are going to open a web community for the supporters. February 2011The rallies of 19 February= The Moscow authorities approved the application of the Committee of Five Demands to hold a rally \\"I'm for Russia without Putin!\\" on 19 February on Pushkin Square in Moscow. On 18 February three activists handing out leaflets with an invitation to the rally were detained; the reasons for their detention were not explained. The Moscow rally was attended by 400‚Äì600 people. Among them were representatives of \\"Solidarity\\", the United Civil Front, the Left Front, the \\"Other Russia\\" and other opposition movements. The decline in attendance compared with previous rallies was partly due to a severe frost. Among the speakers were the leader of the United Civil Front Garry Kasparov, activists of the Solidarity movement, as well as a representative of the movement of defrauded real estate investors. Over 13,000 roubles were collected in favour of political prisoners. The date of next rally was not announced. At the same time a similar rally was held in Kaliningrad. It was organised by self-nominated candidates who had not been admitted to the March elections. A picket for Putin's dismissal was also held in Voronezh. =Other events= In February a beta version of the Political network of direct electronic democracy was launched on the website. The information about the network was sent to the signatories in Moscow and the Krasnodar Territory. On 20 February activists of the movement \\"We\\" stretched a banner with the slogan \\"It's time to change\\" on a bridge near the Kremlin. On the one side the banner depicted Mikhail Khodorkovsky, on the other ‚Äì Vladimir Putin behind bars. After a half an hour the banner was removed by guards of the Baltschug hotel. March 2011 On 11 March, the first anniversary of the start of the campaign, the organizers sent a new message to all signatories informing about the opening of the direct electronic democracy network and urging them to join. On 26 March 2011 the Solidarity movement held an event to coincide with the 11th anniversary of the election of Vladimir Putin as president of the country. The activists handed out ballots with the question to people whether they would vote for or against Vladimir Putin. Polls were held in Moscow and 10 other cities. In total 1,563 people participated and 76.6 percent of them voted against the prime minister. In addition, the activists handed out the report \\"Putin. Results. 10 years\\", while in Moscow they also held a contest of anti-Putin posters. Political network of direct electronic democracy The creation of an online community (social network) of signatories was suggested by the organisers early in the campaign ‚Äì in their messages in March and April 2010. However, the project has been launched with a significant delay due to a number of technological challenges and its volunteer nature. The network has been created at https://web.archive.org/web/20110827152258/http://sos.putinavotstavku.org/. Its testing began in late December 2010. In February information about a beta version was distributed to the signatories living in Moscow and the Krasnodar Territory. On 11 March 2011 information about the creation of the network was sent to all signatories. Within one day, about 1700 people registered for the network. Then registration of new members slowed down. In April, only 48 people joined the network, and by May 2011 the network had 2,098 participants. Well-known opposition politicians, such as Garry Kasparov, Boris Nemtsov and Ilya Yashin, began to publish records from their blogs. Participants also post messages in thematic communities, their own blogs, and take part in polls. However, the activity in the network remains low. According to sociologist Igor Eidman, who has proposed the idea of the network, the project remains unfinished. Eidman wonders what prevents the organisers (and specifically, the group led by Kasparov) to develop the project in accordance with the specifications which he has provided. In case of lack of funds, Eidman proposes to organize fundraising from the signatories.

Built in 1916, the Donoho is one of three hotels remaining from the early-20th century resort boom at Red Boiling Springs, and the last of the great white frame hotels with full-length two-story verandas. Although it has changed ownership several times, the Donoho has remained in operation continuously since its opening. In 1986, the hotel and several outbuildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. The mineral springs at Red Boiling Springs-- which were thought to have curative powers-- were attracting tourists as early as the 1840s. After the Civil War, the nationwide rise in the popularity of mountain spring resorts brought about the development of a large-scale tourist industry at Red Boiling Springs. As transportation to the remote mountain hamlet improved, more elaborate hotels were built, among them the Donoho, which was initially built in the early 1900s.Jeanette Keith Denning, A History of the Resort at Red Boiling Springs, Tennessee: A Thesis Presented to the Faculty of the Graduate School, Tennessee Technological University (Cookeville, Tenn.: 1982), pp. 6-24. After the first Donoho Hotel burned down, the current structure was built as a replacement in 1916. Although alterations were made to the Donoho in the 1950s to provide modern amenities, the hotel still appears much as it did when it was first constructed. Location Salt Lick Creek crossing the Donoho's front lawn. Red Boiling Springs is located amid the Northern Highland Rim, a rugged upland between the Pennyroyal Plateau of Kentucky and the Nashville Basin of Tennessee. Salt Lick Creek, a tributary of the Barren River, slices a narrow valley which was once lined with a dozen hotels and at least as many boarding houses. The Donoho is situated at the base of a hill at the confluence of Salt Lick Creek and Whitley Branch. The NRHP-listed Cloyd Hotel (now the Thomas House) is located across Whitley Branch to the south. The Donoho faces East Main Street, which runs parallel to Salt Lick Creek. The Red Boiling Springs area is underlain by a type of black shale (Chattanooga shale), which is exposed in some stream beds. As water flows over this shale, it collects and dissolves iron sulfate, giving the area's springs their once- sought after mineral potency. The most mineralized water is very salty, and has a strong hydrogen sulfide odor.Vernon Roddy, Thousands to Cure: On the Early Story of Red Boiling Springs, Tennessee (Hartsville, Tenn.: Upper Cumberland People Probe, 1991), p. 361. Red-painted well pumps scattered throughout the town mark the location of the various mineral springs. History The Donoho, southwest corner The mineral springs at Red Boiling Springs were discovered sometime in the 1830s, and by 1844 a hotel had been constructed to house tourists visiting the springs. Due to a lack of transportation to the area (and possibly the Civil War), this early resort struggled financially. By the 1870s, however, a new hotel had been built, and with the establishment of a stagecoach line from Gallatin, Red Boiling Springs began to thrive. A nationwide boom in the popularity of spa resorts in the 1880s and the extension of a railroad line to nearby Hartsville in the 1890s brought still more tourists to Red Boiling Springs, and by the early 1900s the town had four hotels and a dozen or so boarding houses. A hotel owner named Whitley built the first hotel on what is now the Donoho property sometime in the 1890s. Around 1901, the first hotel known as the \\"Donoho\\" was built on the property by Whitley's son-in-law, Squire Donoho (1863-1908), whose family had operated a general store in Red Boiling Springs since the 1880s.Roddy, p. 121n. After Squire Donoho's death, the hotel and property passed into the hands of Whitley's daughter, Tennie, and her husband, Brady Chitwood (1875-1958). The first Donoho Hotel burned in 1915, and the following year the Chitwoods built the present hotel as a replacement. Mineral spring pump The Donoho, like other hotels in the town, offered five types of water: freestone (unmineralized) water, \\"White\\" water, \\"Red\\" and \\"Black\\" water (high in magnesium and calcium), and the most mineralized, \\"Double and Twist.\\" Cups of the \\"Black\\" water were served as a tonic every morning on the hotel's verandas in its early years.Denning, thesis, p. 26. While many believed in the curative effects of the mineral waters, some historians suggest Victorian era tourists merely used health problems as an excuse to take long, recreational vacations. Dancing, bowling, and swimming were common activities. While alcoholic beverages were barred at the Donoho, numerous taverns were scattered around the periphery of Red Boiling Springs. The Chitwoods managed the Donoho until 1955, when they sold it to Ed Hagen. Hagen made several renovations in hopes of reviving the tourist industry at Red Boiling Springs. The hotel has since had several owners, most notably the Walsh family, who operated the hotel from 1974 to 1993.Armour Hotel - Official site. Accessed: 7 April 2010. Design The Donoho's lower veranda The Donoho Hotel is a two-story weatherboard frame structure resting on a brick foundation. The hotel is an elaborate \\"T\\" shape, with the north and south wings hanging from the ends of the T's crossbar, and the rear kitchen wing (added in the 1930s) being the T's base. Verandas span the length of the facade and both sides of both stories. The verandas are supported by four large columns (flanking the hotel's entrance) and twenty-two smaller columns, and contain oak tongue and groove floors. All but one of the hotel's rooms are accessible only from the verandas. The hotel's interior consists of a hallway which leads to a lobby, a lounge, the lone interior guest room, and a 128-capacity dining room (the dining room is in the stem of the \\"T\\"). The rear kitchen wing is accessible from the dining room and from the outside. Along with the kitchen, the rear wing includes a room once reserved for the hotel's cook. Private baths were added to most of the guest rooms in the 1950s. Circa-1890s fruit cellar The Donoho House, which stands immediately north of the hotel, was built in 1924 by the Chitwoods for the managers of the hotel. The house is a two-story brick structure with a shingled hip roof and flared eaves. The house has a full-length lower level porch and a short porch on the upper level. The first-floor interior of the house has three dining rooms, a lobby, a kitchen area, and living quarters. The second-floor interior contains five bedrooms. The house is a contributing building in the historic district. The most historically-notable outbuilding is an 1890s-era fruit cellar, built into the hillside for the property's first hotel. Only the front of the cellar is exposed, and consists of a wooden door flanked by loose river rock. Other outbuildings include a 1916-era washhouse (now a storage shed) and a recently constructed entertainment center, both behind the hotel. The entertainment center now features music on the weekends with an excellent dj, video games and concessions. The front lawn of the hotel contains two gazebos (one of which was built over a \\"Red\\" water spring) and a covered footbridge over Salt Lick Creek. Of these outbuildings, the fruit cellar and washhouse are considered contributing structures in the historic district.

An associate of the Canadian Music Centre and a founding member of the Canadian League of Composers (CLC), he served as the CLC's vice president from 1967 to 1968 and president from 1969 to 1973. He was also vice-president of the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) from 1972 to 1975 and chairman of the ISCM's Canadian Chapter from 1970 to 1974. From 1945 to 2001 he taught music composition, music theory, and piano at The Royal Conservatory of Music where he trained dozens of notable Canadian composers. Early career and education Born in Montreal, Dolin received his early musical training in his native city where he studied piano and music theory with Tania and Vladmir Elgart, Vladimir Emenitov, and Stanley Gardner. He entered the University of Toronto in the late 1930s where he earned a Bachelor of Music in 1942. From 1942 to 1945 he taught music at Trinity College School and was also music supervisor for the public schools in Durham and Northumberland counties in Ontario. In 1945, Dolin began graduate studies in music composition under John Weinzweig at the Toronto Conservatory of Music (now The Royal Conservatory of Music). At the same time, he joined the conservatory's faculty. He eventually returned to the University of Toronto where he earned a Doctor of Music in composition in 1958. His other teachers included Weldon Kilburn, Reginald Godden, E. Robert Schmitz, and Ernst Krenek. Work as a composer Dolin's compositional output includes orchestral music, chamber music, choral music, works for solo piano, vocal art songs, and a number of dramatic works. His music encompasses a variety of styles, from traditional romanticism to chromaticism and other modern compositional techniques. An example of one of his more traditional works is his Serenade for Strings which was premiered by the CBC Symphony Orchestra at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, Norway. One of his more experimental works is Drakkar (1972), a stage work about the first Viking sightings of the New World. The work uses a chamber ensemble with electronic music, three vocal soloists, a multimedia slideshow, dancers, and a narrator. The majority of Dolin's larger scale works date from his early to mid career. Half of his orchestral works were written during the 1950s, including the first two of his three symphonies. His only opera Casino 'Greed' premiered in 1967. He wrote the film score for the 1970 movie Machina. He also contributed music to Canadian radio and television during the 1970s. From the 1980s on, Dolin wrote mostly smaller scale works such as his well-known Two Vocalises for Two Celli (1990). Two notable exceptions are his last symphonic works, Concerto for Oboe and Violoncello with Orchestra (1989) and Double Concerto for Oboe, Cello and Orchestra. The latter work was premiered on 31 March 1988 in a concert honoring the composer's 70th birthday at the Jane Mallett Theatre, St Lawrence Centre which was broadcast on the CBC Radio program Two New Hours. The soloists for the performance included Dolin's daughter, cellist Elizabeth Dolin, and oboist Patricia Morehead. Work as an educator Dolin taught music composition, music theory, and piano at The Royal Conservatory of Music (RCMT) for 56 years. In 1966 he founded the RCMT's electronic music studio after touring similar facilities in the United States and Europe. He also completely revamped the associate degree programs for composition and music theory at the RCMT. In May 1984 he established the Canadian Contemporary Music Workshop (CCMW) at the RCMT. The annual workshop consisted of lectures, readings, and concert performances of new orchestral and chamber music. Historically most of the works presented have been by Canadians but the workshop is open to anyone. Dolin served as the artistic director of the workshop until his retirement from the RCMT in 2001. The school currently awards the \\"Dr. Samuel J. Dolin Scholarship in Composition\\" annually. Dolin's teaching career at the RCMT produced an impressive roster of composers. The success of his students is attributed to not only his pedagogical methods but also to his advocacy of their work. Dolin often performed his students' compositions in faculty recitals or arranged public concerts exhibiting their work at the conservatory. The compositional style of his pupils is highly varied, which demonstrates Dolin's remarkable ability to adapt his teaching to the interests of each individual student.

By contrast, a cold game is one where each player can only worsen their position by making the next move. Cold games have values in the surreal numbers and so can be ordered by value, while hot games can have other values. Example For example, consider a game in which players alternately remove tokens of their own color from a table, the Blue player removing only blue tokens and the Red player removing only red tokens, with the winner being the last player to remove a token. Obviously, victory will go to the player who starts off with more tokens, or to the second player if the number of red and blue tokens are equal. Removing a token of one's own color leaves the position slightly worse for the player who made the move, since that player now has fewer tokens on the table. Thus each token represents a \\"cold\\" component of the game. Now consider a special purple token bearing the number \\"100\\", which may be removed by either player, who then replaces the purple token with 100 tokens of their own color. (In the notation of Conway, the purple token is the game {100‚àí100}.) The purple token is a \\"hot\\" component, because it is highly advantageous to be the player who removes the purple token. Indeed, if there are any purple tokens on the table, players will prefer to remove them first, leaving the red or blue tokens for last. In general, a player will always prefer to move in a hot game rather than a cold game, because moving in a hot game improves their position, while moving in a cold game injures their position. Temperature The temperature of a game is a measure of its value to the two players. A purple \\"100\\" token has a temperature of 100 because its value to each player is 100 moves. In general, players will prefer to move in the hottest component available. For example, suppose there is a purple \\"100\\" token and also a purple \\"1,000\\" token which allows the player who takes it to dump 1,000 tokens of their own color on the table. Each player will prefer to remove the \\"1,000\\" token, with temperature 1,000 before the \\"100\\" token, with temperature 100. To take a slightly more complicated example, consider the game {102} + {5‚àí5}. {5‚àí5} is a token which either player may replace with 5 tokens of their own color, and {102} is a token which the Blue player may replace with 10 blue tokens or the Red player may replace with 2 blue tokens. The temperature of the {102} component is ¬Ω(10 ‚àí 2) = 4, while the temperature of the {5‚àí5} component is 5. This suggests that each player should prefer to play in the {5‚àí5} component. Indeed, the best first move for the Red player is to replace {5‚àí5} with ‚àí5, whereupon the Blue player replaces {102} with 10, leaving a total of 5; had the Red player moved in the cooler {102} component instead, the final position would have been 2 + 5 = 7, which is worse for Red. Similarly, the best first move for the Blue player is also in the hotter component, from {5-5} to 5, even though moving in the {102} component produces more blue tokens in the short term.  Snort  In the game of Snort, Red and Blue players take turns coloring the vertices of a graph, with the constraint that two vertices that are connected by an edge may not be colored differently. As usual, the last player to make a legal move is the winner. Since a player's moves improve their position by effectively reserving the adjacent vertices for them alone, positions in Snort are typically hot. In contrast, in the closely related game Col, where adjacent vertices may not have the same color, positions are usually cold. Applications The theory of hot games has found some application in the analysis of endgame strategy in Go.A bibliography is given in See also * Domineering, another game in which hot positions arise * Cooling and heating (combinatorial game theory), operations to make hot games amenable to the same type of analysis as cold games  References  * * Category:Combinatorial game theory ","title":"Hot game"},{"id":"26879078","text":"Aner Shalev (2007) Aner Shalev (born 24 January 1958) is a professor at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and a writer. Biography Shalev was born in Kibbutz Kinneret and grew up in Beit Berl. He moved to Jerusalem at 18 to study mathematics and philosophy at the Hebrew University, and since then, excluding some years abroad, he has been living mainly in Jerusalem. Shalev received his Ph.D. in mathematics at the Hebrew University in 1989, summa cum laude. His doctoral thesis was written under the supervision of Professors Amitsur and Mann and dealt with group rings, an area combining group theory and ring theory. Shalev spent his post- doctoral period at Oxford University and at the University of London, returned to Israel in 1992, when he was hired as a senior lecturer at the Hebrew University. Shalev was appointed full professor in 1996, and spent sabbaticals at the Universities of Chicago, Oxford (All Souls College), and London (Imperial College). He was also a visiting scholar at other institutes, such as the Australian National University, MSRI Berkeley, the Institute for Advanced Studies at the Hebrew University, and the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. Shalev is joint editor of the Israel Journal of Mathematics, the Journal of Group Theory, and the Journal of Algebra. He gave an invited talk at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Berlin in 1998 and at numerous other mathematical conferences all over the world. Shalev was awarded many grants from various sources, including the ERC Advanced Grant from the European Community (2010‚Äì2014). Aner Shalev is married to Donna Shalev, a senior lecturer at the Classics Department of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and they have two daughters. Research Shalev's main area of research over the years has been Group Theory, and he often uses methods from other disciplines, such as Lie Algebras and Probability. He has also worked on Ring Theory, Lie Algebras, and other areas. Shalev has published around 120 mathematical articles in various international journals. The first fruits of Shalev's research solve various problems in Group Rings using a unified method based on dimension subgroups. Subsequently, he worked extensively in p-groups and pro-p groups and was among those who solved the coclass conjectures on the structure of such groups. Likewise Shalev used Lie methods to solve problems on fixed points of automorphisms of p-groups, and studied subgroup growth of profinite and discrete groups. Probabilistic methods in group theory From 1995 Shalev developed and applied probabilistic methods to finite groups and (nonabelian) finite simple groups in particular. A formative result in this area shows that almost every pair of elements in a finite simple group generate the group. This result, like many others in the field, were proved by Shalev in collaboration with Martin Liebeck of Imperial College at the University of London. The probabilistic approach led to the solution of many classical problems whose formulation does not involve probability; these problems concern quotients of the modular group, conjectures of Babai and of Cameron on permutation groups, diameters of certain Cayley graphs, Fuchsian groups, random walks, etc. Current research Shalev (partly with Larsen) has been researching the behavior of word maps on groups, proving Waring type theorems; he also proved, together with Liebeck, O‚ÄôBrien and Tiep, the Ore conjecture from 1951, according to which every element in a non-cyclic finite simple group is a commutator. Selected papers * * * * * * * * Literary work=Shalev‚Äôs approach to writing Shalev's approach to writing emphasizes language and structure. In all his literary writing he has included formal experimentation. Opus 1 This is Shalev's first literary work which was published in 1988 in the ‚ÄòLibrary‚Äô series at the Keter publishing house, and edited by the literary scholar and critic Yig‚Äôal Schwartz. The manuscript of this book was awarded the Harry Harishon Prize under the auspices of the Hebrew University, in 1986. This is a collection of four stories with a musical superstructure in which Shalev attempts to apply musical terms and concepts to language and to emotions. The book is composed of two major parts: the first part, \\"Legato\\", is characterized by a flowing mode, long sentences without much punctuation and psychologically conveys a state of openness, whereas the second part, \\"Staccato\\", is characterized by short sentences, copious punctuation and an introspective, closed mood. The first of the four stories, ‚ÄòOpus 1‚Äô, describes a boy who falls in love with his piano teacher. The second story, ‚ÄòConcussion‚Äô, portrays a relationship between two young people, and opens with an injury, providing the characters with a new perspective. The third story, ‚ÄòScherzo‚Äô, deals with the journey to New York of an eccentric harpsichord player. The fourth story, ‚ÄòAbsence‚Äô, describes the release from the army on psychiatric grounds of an AWOL interested in being the object of a search party. This story is formally structured as a crossword puzzle with two coordinates and has been described as ‚Äòa crossword riddled with contradictions demanding solutions‚Äô. Overtures Shalev's second book was published in 1996 in the ‚ÄòNew Library‚Äô series (Siman Kri'a ‚Äì ha-Kibbutz ha-Me'uhad) edited by Menachem Peri. The book is composed of seventy openings of stories. The book bears a major element of fragmentation and gaps, and treats openings, or overtures, in the widest sense of the term; at times the stories have an opening and no ending; at others there is only a middle part and the beginning and ending are missing. On the one hand Shalev creates an intense mode of writing, featuring a video-clip nature, and on the other hand he seduces the reader to fill in the gaps by himself. Large parts of the book describe many places in the world where people arrive for short, breathless, periods and are constantly on the go. Dark Matter Shalev's third book is a novel that was published in 2004 at the Zmora Bitan publishing house. It has appeared in German (2007), Italian (2007) and Czech (2009). The book describes a love triangle between a man and two women. Shalev was influenced in this book by the modern astrophysical theory of Dark Matter and Dark Energy; he applies these ideas to relationships between women and men. Alongside physical attraction between men and women, Shalev describes forces of repulsion, which overwhelmingly overcome the forces of attraction. This is an attempt to understand why many love stories which begin so well end so badly. The protagonist of the book is a married Israeli diplomat in New York who, during a visit to Israel, falls in love with a woman doing a doctorate in Physics on Dark Matter. The text is formally divided between emails sent by the woman to the man in the period before their tryst in New York, and descriptions from the man's perspective of that tryst. As the plot progresses the emails asymptotically approach in time the meeting in New York and illuminate its background, but these two types of text and narrative never coalesce.

AIFS functions by shortening or expanding the period a wireless node has to wait before it is allowed to transmit its next frame. A shorter AIFS period means a message has a higher probability of being transmitted with low latency, which is particularly important for delay- critical data such as voice or streaming video. AIFS is a time interval between frames being transmitted under the IEEE 802.11e EDCA MAC. It depends on the Access Category and generally depends on the AIFSN, or AIFS-number. AIFS is defined by the formula AIFSN[AC] * ST + SIFS, where the AIFSN depends on the Access Category. Slot time ST (also denoted by \\\\sigma) is dependent on the physical layer. Short Interframe Space (SIFS) is the time between a DATA and ACK frame. AIFSN[AC] will be set by the AP in the EDCA Parameter set in beacon and probe response frames.

Bollinger (born 1950) is an American author, financial analyst, contributor to the field of technical analysis and the developer of Bollinger Bands. His book Bollinger on Bollinger Bands (2001), has been translated into eleven languages.Chinese (simplified and traditional), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Russian, Spanish and Turkish. Since 1987, he has published the Capital Growth Letter, a newsletter which provides technical analysis of the financial markets.  Bollinger Bands  Bollinger Bands are intervals drawn on a price chart that define high and low on a relative basis. Bollinger started developing Bollinger Bands in the early 1980s. He was trading options at the time and much of his analytics involved volatility. At the time fixed width trading bands were in use. Mr. Bollinger's contribution was to use volatility standard deviation to make trading bands adaptive. When Bollinger first introduced the concept to the public on Financial News Network, they had no name. During the program, the interviewer pointed to the bands and inquired as to what they were; Bollinger replied \\"Let's call them Bollinger Bands.\\"  Rational Analysis  \\"John Bollinger, CFA, has always concentrated on the overlap between technical and fundamental analysis, rather than focus on the differences. To bridge the gap between fundamental and technical analysis, Bollinger advocates an approach he calls 'Rational Analysis'\\".CFA Magazine, November 2005, John Bollinger Profile, Nancy Opiela. Bollinger first coined the term \\"Rational Analysis\\" in the late 1980s. He then defined it as the \\"juncture of the overlap between technical and fundamental analysis\\" and created a visual representation. At the 2004 AIMR Conference, in his presentation titled Combining Technical and Fundamental Analysis, he took his concept one step further. Because the financial analysis community sub-categorizes itself in ever finer specialty groups, his updated definition of Rational Analysis was stated as \\"the union of the sets of technical, fundamental, quantitative and behavioral analysis\\". The analogy Bollinger uses for Rational Analysis is having multiple tool kits each with different tools. To get the job done the rational approach is to take the tool that does the job best, regardless of which tool kit it comes from. The same is true for financial analysis. Depending on the analytical scenario, sometimes technical analysis tools provide the best insights. Sometimes fundamental analysis, behavioral analysis or quantitative analysis; and most often a combination of all four is the most rigorous and productive.  Computerized technical analysis  After purchasing his first microcomputer in 1977, Bollinger became involved in the seminal stages of computer-driven technical analysis. Computer technology allowed Bollinger to develop Group Power, an industry group ranking system that shows developing trends in industry groups and sectors. Over the years the service evolved, the underlying structure becoming a proprietary equal-weighted industry group structure and delivery via the Internet allowed ever more complex analytics. In 1996 Bollinger recognized the potential of the Internet for financial analysis and began the programming for equitytrader.com. The service utilized a 52 rule fuzzy logic model to provide analytics of the US equities market and was one of earliest charting and technical analysis websites.  Professional life  After becoming an independent trader in 1980 he joined the Financial News Network where he was the Chief Market Analyst for seven years, 1984‚Äì1990, a role in which he was responsible for the technical analysis content presented on air. After FNN's acquisition by NBC, Bollinger helped with the transition to CNBC and continued to provide commentary on a regular basis. He founded an investment firm, Bollinger Capital Management. Bollinger is both a CFA Chartered Financial Analyst and CMT Chartered Market Technician and was the first financial analyst to earn both designations. He is also the founding president of Market Analysts of Southern California. Bollinger continues to act as chief executive and leader of Bollinger Capital Management.  Board memberships  Bollinger served on the board of the Market Technicians Association (MTA) for ten years (1988-1997), on the board of International Federation of Technical Analysts (IFTA) for five years (1998-2003) and on the board of the Market Technicians Association Education Foundation (MTAEF) from 2008 though 2012.

Unfortunately that technically meant the executorship could not be properly renounced. The remaining executors put two farms up for auction, on which Victor was a tenant. Victor bought them at the auction. The other beneficiaries of the trust claimed he could not make the purchase, because it would constitute a conflict of interest. Judgment Harman LJ and Danckwerts LJ delivered judgments distinguishing this from Lord Eldon‚Äôs strong words in Ex parte James and Ex parte Lacey because everybody concerned knew that the purchase was planned, and maybe Lord Eldon exaggerated in saying that you can never determine what somebody knows.

Life  Of Arab origin, Modestus was comes Orientis from 358 to 362, succeeding to Nebridius and serving under the Emperors Constantius II and Julian. In 359 he was the president of a commission at Scythopolis, and in this office he judged with cruelty the defendants. While he was in Antioch, Julian appointed Modestus as praefectus urbi of Constantinople, an office he held from 362 to 363. Under Emperor Valens he was Praetorian prefect of the East (369-377) and consul in 372. During his office as Praetorian prefect he completed the building of the Cisterna Modestiaca (a cistern identified with Sarr√¢dshchane), whose building was begun by the architect Helpidius in 363, while Modestus was praefectus urbi. In 371 was appointed president of a commission that was to judge some high officers who had been accused of practicing magic, in particular of having consulted a soothsayer to learn the name of the successor of Emperor Valens. Modestus acted very cruelly, torturing innocent people, thus extorting confessions from them. His consulate, the following year, was probably a reward for his handling of the process. Despite the fact that he was strongly connected with the pagan officers and had been a pagan under the pagan Emperor Julian, under Valens he converted to Arianism, the Emperor's religion. Valens sent Modestus to meet the Nicene bishop Basil of Caesarea, to mediate between the two opposing Christian faiths, but Basil refused. Modestus was then ordered by Valens to use violence against the bishop, but he did not. He is the addressee of 37 letters by Libanius.

Juventus ended a three-year drought of league titles, following a remarkable turnaround in fortunes during the final days of the season, when Inter suffered from a collapse of nerves in the closing stages. On the final day of the league season, Juventus won 2‚Äì0 away from home against Udinese, while Inter fell at Lazio 4‚Äì2, despite leading twice. That handed Juventus its 26th Serie A title, and made up for the disappointing exit from the second group stage in the UEFA Champions League. As for individual players, the season saw new goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon claiming a stature as the best keeper in the world, while David Trezeguet got his Serie A breakthrough, sharing the topscoring title with Dario H√ºbner of Piacenza. Alessandro Del Piero also played a crucial part in the success, scoring 16 goals. Apart from Buffon, pre-season saw three significant signings. Lilian Thuram came from Parma along with Buffon, but failed to establish himself as centre-back and ended up on the right wing-back position. Pavel Nedvƒõd came from Lazio as a replacement for departed Zinedine Zidane after Pavel Nedvƒõd snubbed Manchester United, and performed at an acceptable level, without finding the form he had shown a few years before. Fellow Lazio signing Marcelo Salas was however a major flop, completely failing to get on terms in the new environment, spending almost the entire season injured. The sale of Zin√©dine Zidane to Real Madrid of Spain from Juventus, was the world football transfer record at the time, costing the Spanish club around ‚Ç¨75 million. The intake of Gianluigi Buffon from Parma cost Juventus ‚Ç¨45 million, making it the most expensive transfer for a goalkeeper of all-time.

Merriam-Webster Online. ) is a glaze, icing, sauce, or filling for pastries, made from chocolate and cream.  Preparation  Ganache is normally made by heating equal parts by weight of cream and chopped chocolate, warming the cream first, then pouring it over the chocolate. The mixture is stirred or blended until smooth, with liqueurs or extracts added if desired. Butter is generally added to give the ganache a shiny appearance and smooth texture. Adding corn syrup also gives it a shiny color and is used to sweeten ganaches without the crystallization side effect that comes from other sugars. Depending on the kind of chocolate used, for what purpose the ganache is intended, and the temperature at which it will be served, the ratio of chocolate to cream is varied to obtain the desired consistency. Typically, two parts chocolate to one part cream are used for filling cakes or as a base for making chocolate truffles, while one to one is commonly used as a glaze. If using white chocolate, a ratio of 3 parts chocolate to 1 part cream is standard. Heavy whipping cream is generally preferred, to make a creamier, thicker ganache. This pairs well with a dark chocolate between 60-82%. If the chocolate should seize while being mixed with the warm cream, adding tablespoon by tablespoon of hot water to the mixture can remedy the problem. Cooled ganache can be whipped to increase volume and spread as icing to cover a cake. It becomes thicker as it cools. Ganache is also poured into a mold or terrine while warm, and allowed to set or cool. Once cool, it can be removed from the mold and sliced similarly to p√¢t√©.  History  Ganache or cr√®me ganache was originally a kind of chocolate truffle introduced by the Paris confectioner Maison Siraudin in about 1862 and first documented in 1869.'Jeanne', \\"Correspondance: Jeanne √† Florence\\", Journal des Demoiselles 37:27 (1869) It was named after a popular vaudeville comedy by Victorien Sardou, Les Ganaches (\\"The Chumps\\")Oxford English Dictionary 3rd edition online, 2015, s.v.

Records indicate that Marie Antoinette did not play any significant role in the siege. At the time some forty-five vessels lay in harbour and these were all made prizes. In 1796 she made up part of a small squadron that captured the schooner Charlotte and brig Sally. Perkins remained with her until he was promoted master and commander into the 14-gun brig in early 1797.

However, it is recorded that in 1554, Edinburgh painters led by Walter Binning assaulted an outsider, David Warkman, who had been painting a ceiling.Extracts from the records of the Burgh of Edinburgh 1528 - 1557, pp. 194-5. Walter Binning painted the new north gallery of Holyrood Palace in 1577.Charles Thorpe McInnes, Accounts of the Treasurer: 1574-1580, vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1978), pp. 162, 166. The Warkman family were settled at Burntisland in Fife the 1590s.Michael Apted, 'Mary Somerville's House', in PSAS (1974), p. 228. The Skelmorlie Aisle at Largs was signed by John Stalker, and initials \\"IM\\" painted at Delgatie Castle may be those of the painter John Mellin or Melville.Murray, Ailsa, eConservation Magazine, 10 (2009). It appears that only the wealthiest of the merchant classes and aristocrats could afford this decoration, though the picture is unbalanced as more modest interiors do not survive. Types of patterns The largest group of these ceilings have patterns of fruit and flowers, and may perhaps have evoked tapestry borders. Some ceilings in galleries at the top of buildings incorporated vignettes with biblical or emblematic scenes. Others employ Renaissance grotesque ornament including symbolic emblems. A gallery in a demolished building on Edinburgh's Castlehill had scenes of the Apocalypse and Christ asleep in a storm, set in the Firth of Forth, with a backdrop of the Edinburgh Royal Mile skyline viewed from Fife.Wilson (1891), 194-201 Fragments survive in storage at the National Museums of Scotland.Bath (2003), 239-241 Ceilings painted with rows of heraldic shields included; the gallery at Earlshall Castle and Collairnie Castle, Fife, a ceiling at Linlithgow High Street,Cook (1868), 409-13. and Nunraw House, East Lothian. Death bed scene from the ceiling of St. Mary's, Grandtully Several surviving examples can be seen in Edinburgh; including John Knox's House, Gladstone's Land, and the Canongate Tolbooth museum. The birthroom at Edinburgh Castle was painted by James Anderson to commemorate the fiftieth birthday of James VI, and restored by Walter Melville in 1693.Jenkins, Moses, ed., Building Scotland, John Donald (2010), 95. Gladstone's Land dating from 1619 also has relatively well preserved decoration on plaster contemporary with the ceiling. More extensive domestic mural painting survives at Kinneil House, dating from the 1550s, and painted for the Regent Arran, who employed Walter Binning on some of his projects.JS Richardson, 'Mural Decorations at Kinneil,',PSAS, vol. 75, (1940‚Äì41), 184-204 Aberdour Castle, Fife, has one of latest ceilings c.1633, and Huntingtower Castle the earliest c.1540. Ceilings at Crathes Castle are decorated with the Nine Worthies and the Muses. As at Crathes, beams at Traquair House and Sailor's Walk, Kirkcaldy, carry proverbial and biblical admonitions, written in Middle Scots. A gallery at Provost Skene's House, Aberdeen, is similar in format to the Castlehill painting,Meldrum, (1958/9) St. Mary's, Grandtully, and the Skelmorlie Aisle at Largs, two examples in churches, are painted on the thin lining boards of wooden barrel vaults. Culross Palace, built by Sir George Bruce of Carnock, has a variety of painted interiors including suites of emblems, geometric patterns and biblical scenes.Jervise, Andrew, (1854) Other ceilings remain in private buildings, and a number of ceilings were salvaged and stored by Historic Scotland including two from Dysart, Fife. The National Museum of Scotland displays a ceiling from Rossend Castle, Burntisland, Fife,Apted (1971/2): Thomson (1975) and a screen from Wester Livilands, near Stirling.Ross (1898/9) Stirling Smith Museum and Art Gallery has a ceiling from Robert Drummond of Carnock's house. A room from Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline's Pinkie House is displayed at the Museum of Edinburgh. Painted beams from Midhope Castle were moved to Abbey Strand, Edinburgh, and a ceiling from Prestongrange House is at Merchiston Tower, though these last two are not regularly open to the public. Two rooms in the G&V; Hotel in Edinburgh still have painted ceilings from the original early seventeenth century tenement building on the Lawnmarket.A. Crone & D. Sproat, 'Revealing the History, timber framed building at No 302 Lawnmarket Edinburgh' in Journal of Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland, 22 (EUP 2012) pp. 19-36 Painted ceilings concealed by later plasterwork continue to be discovered. A ceiling with grotesques and scrollwork \\"of exceptional quality\\" was found at Moubray House on Edinburgh's Royal Mile in 1999. After restoration the whole building was pledged as a gift to Historic Scotland by an American benefactor in 2012.Bath (2003), p.245: Scotsman Newspaper, Lifestyle, 24 August 2012 Another ceiling on Edinburgh's Royal Mile was discovered in 2010 in Clement Cor's house in Advocate's Close. A part of the ceiling was varnished with pine resin. The joints in the floorboards had been sealed with paper tape.Sh√¢n Ross, Sources of the designs Ceiling from Rossend Castle, Burntisland, in the National Museum of Scotland, painted for Sir Robert Melville of Murdocairney with emblems taken from Claude Paradin Some of the ceilings include pictures or emblems based on European printed books. These were very much part of elite culture in Scotland, in 1584 the poet William Fowler told a German traveller Lupold von Wedel that he was teaching James VI and I the art of memory, and Fowler later noted that the king had taught him poetry and imprese at the same time.Gottfied von B√ºlow, 'Journey Through England and Scotland made by Lupold von Wedel in the years 1584 and 1585', in Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, vol. 9 (London, 1895), p. 247: Henry Meikle, Works of William Fowler, vol. 3 (STS, Edinburgh, 1940), p. xix fn. 4. In July 1593 William Dundas of Fingask wrote from Edinburgh to Sir Robert Cecil in London, saying that he had heard Cecil was completing a gallery and would like paintings with \\"such toyis\\" as he had seen himself in Scotland. Dundas seems to have sent Cecil a present of sketches, presumably of emblematic devices.Annie Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 377-8. Prestongrange's ceiling painted for Mark Kerr and Helen Leslie in 1581 has comic figures from Richard Breton's Les songes drolatiques de Pantagruel, Paris (1565). (1565). Nicolas Elphinstone gave James VI a copy of this book, and there was another in the library of Adam Bothwell, Bishop of Orkney who died in 1593.Michael Bath, Renaissance Painting in Scotland (Edinburgh, 2003), pp. 116-8: G. F. Warner, Library of James VI (Edinburgh, 1893), p. lxiii. Other ornaments were taken from 17 engravings after Hans Vredeman de Vries called the Grottesco, printed by Gerard de Jode in Antwerp (1565‚Äì71), and from the Caryatidum depicting architectural 'terms' - load bearing figures.Michael Bath, Renaissance Painting in Scotland (Edinburgh, 2003), pp. 116-8. The ceiling is dated 1581 and at that time complimented a sideboard gifted by Esm√© Stuart.Sanderson, Margaret H.B., A Kindly Place? Living in Sixteenth-Century Scotland (Tuckwell, 2002), p. 93. This ceiling was moved to the tower of Merchiston Castle for Napier University. At Rossend Castle (now in the National Museum of Scotland), emblems by Claude Paradin,French Emblems at Glasgow - two editions of Paradin are available here. Gabriele Simeoni and Alciato were used, again with ornamental detail from Vredeman de Vries's Grottesco, with devices of European princes. A ceiling at Riddle's Court in Edinburgh has the eagle of the Holy Roman Empire combined with a thistle, perhaps to commemorate the visit of the Duke of Holstein in 1598.M. Pearce, 'Riddle's Court', in History Scotland Magazine, 12:4 (July/August 2012), pp. 20-27. Inscriptions on beams salvaged from Carnock House, Stirlingshire, the oak timber dated to 1589 by dendrochronology, include stoic advice in Scots from Gaius Musonius Rufus (possibly via the English author William Baldwin) with Biblical proverbs.Michael Bath, Anne Crone, Michael Pearce, Painted ceilings from 16th and 17th century properties (Historic Environment Scotland: Edinburgh, 2017), pp. 8, 18-9. Emblems at Culross Palace were adapted from A Choice of Emblems by Geffrey Whitney, (London, 1586). The tiny engravings made by the French goldsmith Etienne Delaune supplied the ornament at the Skelmorlie Aisle. Amongst the sources used at Pinkie were de Vries's Perspectiva, (1605), Otto van Veen's Emblemata Horatiana, Antwerp (1607), and Denis de Lebey de Batilly's Emblemata (Frankfurt, 1596). These demonstrate the use of renaissance pattern books by painters and patrons in Scotland, and coupled with copious classical quotations, the wealth and topicality of the library of Alexander Seton.Bath (2003), 79-103, 231, 236, 249-252, 258: Peter Davidson, 'Alexander Seton, First Earl of Dunfermline: his library, his house, his world', British Catholic History, 32:3 (May 2015), pp. 315-342: Ian Campbell, 'An ‚ÄòInventair of som of the Earill of Dunfermline his buiks in Pinkie June 1625‚Äô: a fragment of the library of Alexander Seton', Innes Review, 67:1 (2016), pp. 31-54. Critical literature Painted wooden vault at Grandtully Chapel Apart from William Dundas' letter of 1593, there are no contemporary references to this type of decoration. Most examples were concealed behind later interiors or neglected in buildings which became lower status accommodation. In the early nineteenth century antiquarian interest was kindled by discovery during the demolition of buildings in Edinburgh and Dundee. Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe and Rev. Sime rescued a part of the Apocalypse painting from Edinburgh's Castlehill and made a series of coloured record drawings now held by the Historic Environment Scotland. Daniel Wilson described the ceiling in his Memorials of Edinburgh. At the end of the century, Andrew Lyons, artist and antiquarian, made drawings of a number of ceilings (also held by HES/RCAHMS), and published articles in the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries, Scotland, PSAS. In the first half of the twentieth century conservation works were led by John Houston of the Ministry of Works. Conservators Ian Hodkinson and Rab Snowden, and Michael R Apted, an inspector of ancient monuments, were instrumental in the rescue and salvage of a number of painted ceilings, published in Apted's 1966 monograph, and a series of PSAS articles. The National Trust for Scotland and the Ministry of Works set up a centre at Stenhouse in 1965 to specialise in the conservation of these paintings. Apted made an exhaustive search of archive references to painting for his Edinburgh PhD thesis, and this formed the basis for his collaboration with Susan Hannabuss on Painters in Scotland: A Biographical Dictionary published in 1978. John Cornforth admired the contribution of the Stenhouse Conservation Centre as antiquarian and romantic.Cornforth (1994), 34. More recently, Michael Bath, emeritus professor of English, Strathclyde University, has re-assessed the corpus with a particular focus on the emblems used and their origins and meanings to the Scottish patrons. Bath has published a number of articles and a detailed illustrated 2003 monograph exploring sources with a useful comprehensive inventory of examples both extant and destroyed. Ailsa Murray's 2009 article and Chantal‚ÄêHelen Thuer's 2011 report and explore conservation methods. Michael Bath, Anne Crone and Michael Pearce (2017) reflected on Anne Crone's dendrochronogy work on the salvaged timbers stored by Historic Environment Scotland. Fern Insh writes on religious connections in the imagery and the patrons who commissioned these works; and Michael Bath (2018) revisits emblems and symbolism making new connections.

Sponsored by Vivian McPeak, Douglass Hiatt, Jeffrey Steinborn, Philip Dawdy, initiative I-1068 sought to legalize marijuana by removing marijuana offenses from the state's controlled substances act, but failed to gather enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. The main proponent of I-1068 was the group Sensible Washington. The measure's co- authors included Seattle attorneys Doug Hiatt and Jeffrey Steinborn, Seattle Hempfest founder Vivian McPeak, medical marijuana patient and Cannabis Defense Coalition spokesman Ric Smith, and former Seattle Weekly contributor Philip Dawdy. Status of initiative Sensible Washington needed to present 241,153 Washington voter signatures to the Secretary of State by July 2, 2010 to get the measure on the ballot in November. As of May 20, the group had collected approximately 100,000 signatures. On July 1, Sensible Washington announced that enough signatures had not been collected for ballot inclusion. History In the United States, federal laws related to relaxing penalties related to marijuana have been discussed but not passed. Notable among these is the proposed Medical Marijuana Patient Protection Act of 2008, versions of which have been discussed since 2001. In 1998, Washington voters passed Initiative 692, removing criminal penalties for medical patients with an approved condition. Ten years later, a \\"60-day\\" supply for patients was defined as 24 ounces and 15 plants. In early 2010, two bills relating to marijuana were defeated in committee by the Legislature (one proposed selling marijuana through liquor stores, the other sought decriminalize marijuana). Frustrated with the Legislature, Seattle activists filed I-1068 in January. On February 10, the Attorney General's office issued a ballot title and summary for the initiative. One week later, the campaign announced they had \\"cleared the statutory hurdles\\" and would start collecting signatures for the initiative.  Text of initiative  The full text of the initiative is available online. I-1068 text Ballot Title Statement of Subject: Initiative Measure No. 1068 concerns marijuana. Concise Description: This measure would remove state civil and criminal penalties for persons eighteen years or older who cultivate, possess, transport, sell, or use marijuana. Restrictions and penalties for persons under eighteen would be retained. Should this measure be enacted into law? \` Yes [ ] No [ ] \` Ballot Measure Summary This measure would remove state civil and criminal penalties for persons eighteen years or older who cultivate, possess, transport, sell, or use marijuana. Marijuana would no longer be defined as a \\"controlled substance.\\" Civil and criminal penalties relating to drug paraphernalia and provisions authorizing seizure or forfeiture of property would not apply to marijuana related offenses committed by persons eighteen years or older. The measure would retain current restrictions and penalties applicable to persons under eighteen. Petition distribution and circulation Qualifying I-1068 for the November ballot is a grassroots, all-volunteer effort. In addition to traditional methods of distribution and circulation Sensible Washington has used some nontraditional methods to make petitions available to supporters. The web site has PDF copies of the petition for download and instructions for printing valid petitions from the PDFs. 80,000 copies of the initiative were distributed in the June 23, 2010 issue of The Stranger. These were accompanied by a full page advertisement explaining how to sign and collect valid signatures, return the petition and emphasizing the deadline for returning the petitions. Obstacles to qualifying I-1068 for the ballot *Alleged fraud Fraudulently misrepresenting other initiatives as I-1068, the Marijuana Reform Act Initiative, has been documented. Philip Dawdy, a campaign manager for I-1068, has stated his intention to file a complaint with the Washington State Attorney General's Office. Concerns have been expressed by I-1068 supporters that the initiative has not been signed by people who mistakenly believe they have already signed the Marijuana Reform initiative. *Lack of use of signature gathering firm Despite high polling numbers it is extremely rare that an initiative make it to the ballot without the use of a paid signature gathering firm. \\"They're pretty close to essential,\\" says Philip Dawdy of the legalize- marijuana Initiative 1068.

Lineage Born to Charles de Rohan and his wife, Charlotte √âlisabeth de Cochefilet, he was the couple‚Äôs third child and second son.Anselme, P√®re. Histoire de la Maison Royale de France‚Äô‚Äô, tome 4. Editions du Palais-Royal, 1967, Paris. pp. 46, 64-68. (French). Until the death of his paternal grandfather, Charles, 4th Duc de Montbazon in 1699, he was fifth in line of succession to the dukedom and not expected to inherit it: Ahead of him were his father Charles, then styled Prince de Gu√©m√©n√© (1655-1727), his eldest brother Fran√ßois-Armand, Prince de Montbazon (1682-1717), Fran√ßois-Armand's son Charles-Jules de Rohan (1700-1703) and another older brother, Louis-Charles-Casimir, Comte de Rochefort (1686-1749). After Charles-Jules died as a child, Louis-Charles- Casimir forfeited his claim to a secular inheritance by joining the Order of the Holy Cross, whereupon Hercule M√©riadec became Comte de Rochefort. His father was the fifth Duc de Montbazon, but succession to that title remained uncertain until Fran√ßois-Armand died without living children at the age of 35 in 1717, leaving Hercule-M√©riadec to become Prince de Gu√©m√©n√©, the title usually borne by the heir apparent. Biography Only when his father died in October 1727 did he succeed to the Montbazon ducal peerage and become head of the House of Rohan, which enjoyed the high rank of princes √©trangers at the court of Louis XVI. While serving in the Gendarmes de la Garde, he held the position of standard-bearer of the company. Hercule M√©riadec's siblings included Louis Constantin de Rohan, Bishop of Strasbourg, and Armand Jules de Rohan-Gu√©m√©n√©, Archbishop of Rheims, who crowned Louis XV king. He married his second cousin, Louise Gabrielle Julie de Rohan-Soubise (1704‚Äì1780), youngest daughter of Hercule M√©riadec, Duc de Rohan-Rohan and Prince de Soubise (1669-1749), head of the younger (Soubise) branch of the House of Rohan. Her mother was Anne Genevi√®ve de L√©vis, daughter of Louis Charles de L√©vis, Duc de Ventadour. His wife presented their daughter, Charlotte Louise, to Louis XV and the queen, Marie Leszczy≈Ñska, during the Honneurs de la Cour on 26 October 1737 at Fontainebleau, two days before her marriage. Hercule-M√©riadec died at Sainte-Maure aged sixty nine and was succeeded by his son, Jules. His two youngest sons were cardinals and only one of his daughters had issue (Charlotte Louise).

It proved an effective way. Community is an attempt to bring both human and non-human resources together to undertake developmental activities in order to achieve sustainable development. Process Community mobilization is a process through which action is stimulated by a community itself, or by others, that is planned, carried out, and evaluated by a community's individuals, groups, and organizations on a participatory and sustained basis to improve the health, hygiene and education levels so as to enhance the overall standard of living in the community. A group of people have transcended their differences to meet on equal terms in order to facilitate a participatory decision-making process. In other words, it can be viewed as a process which begins a dialogue among members of the community to determine who, what, and how issues are decided, and also to provide an avenue for everyone to participate in decisions that affect their lives. Requirements Community mobilization needs many analytical and supportive resources which are internal (inside the community) and external (outside the community) as well. Resources include: * Leadership * Organizational capacity * Communications channels * Assessments * Problem solving * Resource mobilization * Administrative and operational management  Strategies  The Centre for Disease Control envisions that strong healthcare initiatives will be readily owned by a community if the leaders (\\"grass tops\\"), the citizens (\\"grass roots\\"), and youth are fully engaged in mobilizing the community, educating stakeholders, and implementing evidence-based interventions. To this respect, 14 strategies guided by best practice have been reported (Huberman 2014): 1\\\\. Secure strong leadership 2\\\\. Establish a formal structure 3\\\\. Engage diverse organizations, community leaders, and residents 4\\\\. Ensure authentic participation and shared decision making 5.ensure authentic and productive roles for young people 6\\\\.

He was the first member of the family to build a substantial house on the present site of Eaton Hall in Cheshire. Early life and education Grosvenor was born at Eaton Hall, Cheshire, the son of Roger Grosvenor by his wife Christian (or Christine), daughter of Thomas Myddleton of Chirk Castle, Denbighshire. He was less than five years old when his father, Roger, was killed in a duel with his cousin, Hugh Roberts, on 22 August 1661. Roger had been the son and heir of Sir Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Baronet, and therefore, Grosvenor succeeded to the baronetcy upon the death of his grandfather Sir Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Baronet on 31 January 1665. He was eight years old at that time. Grosvenor was educated by a private tutor, who also accompanied him when he undertook the Grand Tour, in his case, a three-year educational tour of France, Italy and the Levant, starting in 1670.Handley, Stuart (2004) (online edition 2008) 'Grosvenor, Sir Thomas, third baronet (1655-1700)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Retrieved on 6 April 2010. On his return, he set about building a new house at Eaton. At that time, the family house was a medieval moated house. The new house was the first substantial one to be built, and it was constructed to the north of the older house. Grosvenor appointed the architect William Samwell to design it, and building started in 1675. By 1683, over ¬£1,000 (¬£ ) had been spent on the hall. The money for this venture came partly from the estates, and also from coal and lead mines, and from stone quarries in north Wales, that were owned by the family. Public life Grosvenor played his part in public life. In 1677, he was granted the freedom of Chester, and later the same year, he became an alderman. Two years later, he was returned as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Chester for the first time, in what became known as the Habeas Corpus Parliament; in all, he was to serve in six parliaments. In 1685, he became Mayor of Chester, and later that year, raised a troop of horses to support James II in the Monmouth Rebellion. Grosvenor served as Sheriff of Cheshire in 1688‚Äì89. Family Grosvenor married in 1677; he was aged 21, and his wife, Mary Davies, was only 12 years old. The marriage was arranged by their families in a manner and at an age which was quite normal in England in that era; it proved to be harmonious and conventional, and lasted all their lives. Mary was the daughter of Alexander Davies, a scrivener (scribe), and she had inherited substantial land to the west of London. This was part of the Manor of Ebury (previously Eia), and Mary's portion consisted of 'swampy meads' (marshland). The area was later to become the Mayfair, Park Lane, and Belgravia areas of London; the most valuable parts of the Grosvenor Estate. The couple had three daughters and five sons. Two of the sons, Thomas and Roger, died young; the other three sons all succeeded in turn to the baronetcy, Richard became the 4th Baronet, Thomas the 5th, and Robert the 6th. Mary, Lady Grosvenor, had converted to Roman Catholicism shortly after coming of age. Because of this, and because Eaton Hall was used as a meeting place for Catholics, Grosvenor's loyalty to the king was questioned. However, he continued openly as an Anglican until his death in 1700, and he was buried in Eccleston church. Grosvenor's surviving sons were all under age at the time of his death; Sir Richard Myddelton, 3rd Baronet, and Thomas and Francis Cholmondeley were appointed as their guardians. Mary was buried in the churchyard of St. Margaret's Church, Westminster, where in 1892, her tomb was the only one to be seen there, close to the north porch of the church.Smith, J.E., St John the Evangelist, Westminster: Parochial Memorials, Westminster, 1892, pp.355-362 File:Arms of Grosvenor baronets.svgCoat of arms of the Grosvenor Baronets, of Eaton (1622) File:St Mary's Church Eccleston, Old Churchyard - old Grovenor family gravesite1.JPGSt Mary's Church, Eccleston ‚Äì the enclosure which marks the site of the Grosvenor family vault within the demolished old church File:St Mary's Church Eccleston, Old Churchyard - old Grovenor family gravesite - plaque.JPGSt Mary's Church, Eccleston ‚Äì the tablet in the enclosure marking the site of the Grosvenor family vault within the old church File:St Mary's Church Eccleston, north aisle - Grosvenors buried in the old church.JPGSt Mary's Church, Eccleston ‚Äì the tablet in the new church which lists the Grosvenors buried in the demolished old church ReferencesExternal links * Category:1656 births Category:1700 deaths Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of England Category:Tory MPs (pre-1834) Category:High Sheriffs of Cheshire Thomas Grosvenor, 3rd Baronet Category:English MPs 1679 Category:English MPs 1680‚Äì1681 Category:English MPs 1685‚Äì1687 Category:English MPs 1690‚Äì1695 Category:English MPs 1695‚Äì1698 Category:English MPs 1698‚Äì1700 ","title":"Sir Thomas Grosvenor, 3rd Baronet"},{"id":"26880066","text":"The Water Witch Club Historic District is located in Middletown Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey.

History The development of the CBS International Business School is closely connected to the European Business and Language Academy, which was founded in 1908 as a private academy at the location of the current Cologne campus in the southern part of Cologne. In the winter semester 1993/1994, the Europ√§ische Wirtschafts- und Sprachenakademie (EWS) introduced courses of study according to the Bachelor system for the first time under the new name \\"International Campus\\", which made it one of the first providers of these degrees in Germany alongside the University of Bochum. In 1998, the study programmes of this business studies bachelor model were the first in Germany to be accredited by FIBAA. One year later, the university was renamed \\"Cologne Business School - International Campus\\", which can still be found in the acronym \\"CBS\\" of the university name \\"CBS International Business School\\". The CBS first expanded in 2006 and founded the European Management School (EMS) as its second location, today's \\"Campus Mainz\\". Since 2016, the CBS has been part of the Stuttgart Klett Group and was awarded IACBE accreditation (International Accreditation Council for Business Education) in 2018. With the re-design of the new brand in 2020, the CBS International Business School presents itself as a joint university group with an enhanced study profile and with the new slogan \\"Creating tomorrow\\". Since August 2020, the CBS International Business School has had a further campus in Potsdam-Babelsberg.

This is not only reflected in the international orientation of its English-language degree programmes but also in a broad international network of currently 130 partner universities worldwide (as of February 2020). The CBS also has an Erasmus Charter for Higher Education (ECHE), which makes it part of the Erasmus+ programme funded by the EU Commission. In the curricula of the English-language BA and BSc programmes, the semester abroad is integrated as a compulsory part of the programme. The semesters abroad are made possible via a mobility window in the 5th semester of the degree course and are completed at the CBS partner universities. Internships abroad are also supported and promoted by the CBS Career Service. The student body of the CBS is characterised by a high degree of diversity with a share of over 20% of international students from almost 75 different nations across all study courses. The integration of the international students is promoted via close academic and also social support through consultation hours, various events and German courses at the CBS.  Further facilities of CBS International Business School:  Logo of the Center for Advanced Sustainable Management  Center for Advanced Sustainable Management  The Center for Advanced Sustainable Management (CASM) was founded at the CBS in 2016 from the Dr. J√ºrgen Meyer Endowed Chair for International Business Ethics and Sustainability. Since its foundation, the CASM has been headed by Prof. Dr. Ren√© Schmidpeter and Patrick Bungard. The CASM deals with questions of corporate social responsibility, international business and corporate ethics, sustainability as well as social innovation. It integrates and promotes research and education on relevant sustainability and CSR topics within the university. The CASM also aims to generate an active transfer of knowledge between academic research and business practice through corporate cooperation. The Center has developed strong relationships with key companies in the field of sustainable management as well as with chambers of commerce, ministries of economics, NGOs, think tanks and thought leaders at local and international level. Together they are working to make sustainability the new standard in business practice and in sustainable management education. CASM aims to drive the change towards systemically sustainable management by training young leaders, imparting knowledge and bringing together people who believe in the same way of thinking. Since 2018, CASM has been a partner in various international research cooperation that focus on the development and piloting of innovative teaching formats for sustainable management and their effectiveness. CASM is a founding member of the international WISE Institute. WISE is based at the IEDC-Bled School of Management and aims to serve professionals in the field of sustainable business (including business ethics, CSR and environmental responsibility) in emerging economies through practice- oriented research, education and networking. The aim is to develop an ongoing research and education agenda to advance integrated sustainability and facilitate the implementation of best practices in emerging economies. Further partners are the National Institute for Innovation Management at Zhejiang University in China and the University of Stellenbosch Business School in South Africa. In addition, since 2019 CASM has been a member of the ESSSR (European School of Sustainability Science & Research) and the NBS SSC (Network for Business Sustainability: Sustainability Centers Community). In 2018, CASM, in cooperation with the Humboldt University, the Hamburg School of Business Administration and other national and international partners, hosted the 8th International Conference on Sustainability and Responsibility on the topic of \\"Responsible Leadership in Times of Transformation\\" for the first time. More than 400 participants from around 40 nations attended the CSR and Sustainability Conference. In addition, the 5th Responsible Management Education Research Conference took place in the run-up to the conference, which in 2018 was under the patronage of the PRME Regional Chapter DACH and dealt with the topic \\"Leadership Development for Advancing the Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals\\". Logo of hochschulgr√ºndernetz cologne e. V.  university start-up network cologne e.V.  In 2018, CBS International Business School took over the office of the hochschulgr√ºndernetz cologne e. V. (hgnc), which is represented by Prof. Dr. Ulrich Anders as Managing Director and Flora Carlhoff as Project Manager. The hgnc offers a wide range of consulting and information services for prospective founders from the Cologne region, which are free of charge for students, graduates and scientists from Cologne universities and non-university research institutions. With 20 partners from universities and institutions in Cologne (including innovation centres, banks, the Cologne Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the City of Cologne), the association, which was founded in 1998, has developed into the first point of contact and expert network in Cologne.  Research  At the core of the research work at CBS are the two areas of sustainable management and digitisation, which are expressed in the concept of \\"Corporate Digital Responsibility\\". Other current research clusters include: \\"Education & Methods\\", \\"Business Transformation\\", \\"Entrepreneurship & Innovation\\", \\"Leadership, People & Organisation\\" and \\"Financial Markets & Rising Economics\\", all of which are considered in the context of globalisation. The new research structure of CBS International Business School The cluster \\"Business Transformation\\" comprises all steps of an entrepreneurial value chain and is dedicated to questions of how these value chain steps must be transformed or realigned through sustainable management and digitisation. \\"Entrepreneurship & Innovation\\", as another cluster, is dedicated to the establishment of innovative digital and sustainable business models. \\"Leadership, People & Organisation\\" focuses in particular on the constantly increasing demands on the management culture, personnel management practices and organisation of a company. The cluster \\"Financial Markets & Rising Economies\\" plays a special role in the context of sustainable management and digitalisation. The fast-growing emerging economies are facing central challenges in terms of climate protection, energy consumption, or the protection of human rights, while shaping their growth and role in a globalised economy. Finally, the cluster \\"Education & Methods\\" is of particular importance as a base for research. In addition to implementing integrated curricula for sustainable management and digitisation, educational institutions are faced with the challenge of implementing new methods for research and teaching as well as finding instruments that document learning success in a sustainable manner.

The World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth was a global gathering of civil society and governments hosted by the government of Bolivia in Tiquipaya, just outside the city of Cochabamba on 19-22 April 2010.  Description  The event was attended by around 30,000 people from over 100 countries, and the proceedings were transmitted live online by OneClimate and the Global Campaign for Climate Action (GCCA). The conference was viewed as a response to what some termed failed climate talks in Copenhagen during the 15th United Nations Conference of Parties (COP15) climate meetings in December 2009. There have been claims after the Conference ended that there were flaws in its organization and that the Venezuelan government funded it partially. One of the important objectives of the conference was to produce proposals for new commitments to the Kyoto Protocol and projects in the lead-up to the next UN climate negotiations scheduled during the COP16 meeting in Cancun, Mexico in December 2010. Conference topics included a Universal Declaration on the Rights of Mother Earth (see external links below), a World People's Referendum on Climate Change, and the establishment of a Climate Justice Tribunal.

A complex of \\"Plattenbauten\\" (apartment blocks constructed from large, prefabricated concrete slabs) was built in Michenzani as well as other areas of suburban and rural Zanzibar. The buildings are different sizes, with the tallest having seven floors and the shortest four floors. As a consequence of the construction process, some buildings comprise different parts with a different number of floors each: for example, block #7 is partly five floors and partly seven floors high. Despite being the tallest public buildings in Zanzibar, no lifts were installed and all the flats are only accessible by stairs. The Michenzani apartment blocks used to be the pride of revolutionary Zanzibar; despite this, virtually no maintenance has been made after the 1970s, so the buildings are now in a state of decay. Lack of water pressure makes water services unavailable from the second floors up. As a result, many residents have installed their own water pumps, which are not in keeping with the original style of the buildings. Some of the apartments were renovated in 2010, giving them a fresh coat of paint.

Released on 20 January 2010 and initially only shown in the local Sussex area, the short film became an international phenomenon after it was distributed on the internet, through social networking sites and YouTube, gaining over a million views in its first two weeks. By 13 February 2010 it had reached 129 different countries, was the 5th top rated video that month on YouTube and was the most top rated YouTube film of all time in the education category. The film achieved the highest rating of No. 8 Top Rated (All Time) film on YouTube, and as of 27 March 2013 it has had over 16,599,000 views. The film has been praised for its beauty and its emotional impact. The film has so far not been shown on television as part of a road safety campaign; although that was for which it was primarily designed and its spread has been almost entirely through the internet. Development Despite being a legal requirement for all car drivers and passengers in the UK, some people fail to wear their seat belt. The Sussex Safer Roads Partnership is a local government body in the East Sussex and West Sussex areas of England, and was looking to produce an internet-based road safety campaign film with a positive message, rather than one using more graphic shock tactics. Double BAFTA award-winning writer and director Daniel Cox learned of the proposed campaign, and approached the Partnership with an idea for just such a film: > \\"Key to the film's creation was to focus on a message that didn't take a > conventional route to shock and scare the audience; rather it was my > intention to bring the audience in on the conversation of road safety, > specifically seat belts, and the best way to do this was to make a film that > could engage the viewer purely visually and could be seen and understood by > all, whoever they are and wherever they lived.\\" (Daniel Cox) The name of the film, Embrace Life, reflects its focus on life rather than the death and injury often associated with car crashes. Producer Sarah Alexander joined the project and immediately was faced with the challenge of the logistics of bringing Cox's vision to fruition. He specifically wanted slow- motion photography, requiring state of the art camera technology and 93,000 watts of lighting required by the high-speed filming. > \\"I wanted to create a visual metaphor addressing how a single decision in a > person's day can greatly influence both their own and their loved ones' > lives. Choosing to film the story inside the family living room represents > the feelings many people equate with their own car, in that it represents a > level of safety and protection from the 'outer' world. So to create the > emotion of this dramatic moment, I wanted to tell the story using slow > motion to allow the audience the time to be drawn into the film's world and > to let them connect with and project their own feelings onto the scenario > playing out before them. I wanted to give the audience the time to breathe, > to absorb our message and using slow motion was the right technique to allow > this to happen.\\" (Daniel Cox) > \\"It was central to the development of the project that we root the concept > of wearing a seat belt firmly in the family domain, and create the advert so > that it could be viewed by anyone of any age. Children are so important as > opinion formers within their family that we felt it imperative to have a > child take a pivotal role in relaying our message. One key aspect to the > storytelling is that we developed Embrace Life to be non-language specific, > so that the message wouldn‚Äôt become lost when viewed by visitors to, or > residents of, the UK where English might not be their first language.\\" > (Daniel Cox) > \\"The inspiration for Embrace Life came from wanting to offer a positive > message towards road safety really. A lot of the campaigns focus on the more > graphic and horrific outcomes of accidents, whereas I really wanted to bring > people into the conversation. The house represents a safety area, an area > where you're normally surrounded by your loved ones, and the car can be an > extension of that, but it's not only yourself that's impacted if something > unfortunately goes wrong, but also family and friends too.\\" (Daniel Cox) Production The film had a small budget of ¬£47,000 (US$72,000) and was shot over two days in the summer of 2009 at Halliford Studios in London. The film was shot on a Phantom HD digital camera, with speeds of up to 1000 frames per second, and no CGI was used in the making of the film. It has a running time of 1 minute 29 seconds. The music was specially composed for the film by Dutch composer Siddhartha (Sid) Barnhoorn, and is available as a download from his online music store.

Film A still from Embrace Life, showing the mother and daughter restraining the father A father, mother and daughter are playing in their living room, with the father play-acting at driving a car: he turns an imaginary ignition key, operates an imaginary pedal and steers an imaginary wheel. His family watch from the sofa. The father turns to look at them, and as he turns back, his concentration momentarily taken from the \\"road\\", he sees some sort of peril approaching. He grimaces and turns the wheel to the left to avoid the oncoming threat. Realising the danger he is in, the daughter rushes to him and embraces him around the waist; his wife follows, putting her arms around his upper body, making the shape of a seat belt. The impact occurs, and the man is violently thrown in his seat; his legs jolt out and kick over a table with a bowl holding small metallic decorations. The bowl is thrown upwards and the metal decorations shower down. The daughter and mother successfully restrain the father, and he recovers, bringing his arms up to embrace his family who have saved him. The legend \\"Embrace Life Always wear your seat belt\\" appears on the left of the screen, and as the film fades to black the triangular grey, orange and blue Embrace Life logo is shown above that of the Sussex Safer Roads Partnership. Imagery The daughter's and mother's arms represent the two parts of a seat belt. The film was made for a British audience; cars are driven on the left hand side of the road in the UK and so the positioning of the mother's arms reflects the position of the upper seat belt strap for a driver in the UK. Similarly, the father turns the wheel to the left (the shoulder part of the road in the UK) to avoid the oncoming danger. If the film was shown in mirror image, it would correct these apparent inconsistencies for audiences in those parts of the world where cars are driven on the right hand side.The ignition key scene would not need reversing, as most cars, regardless of which side of the road they are driven on, have the ignition key on the right hand side of the steering wheel. The daughter is wearing fairy wings. Some commentators have seen these as angel wings, symbolising a guardian angel. The small metallic decorations graphically represent the shattered windscreen glass and metal fragments generated during a car accident. Campaign One of the Embrace Life logos in the council-sanctioned graffiti campaign in Brighton, with the Embrace This website address The film was first shown to the Sussex Safer Roads Partnership members, including emergency services representatives, at The Capitol, Horsham, West Sussex on 20 January 2010. Alexander said of this occasion: > \\"The scariest part of making anything is the first time you show other > people. Touching people‚Äôs emotions is not a science at all, it is an > incredibly difficult thing to do and even after working on it for months you > are still not sure how people will react. We always aimed to make something > of TV/cinema quality so that is where we launched it. The first time I saw > it on a cinema screen in front of an audience of hardened Police officers > and realised they were touched, I was sure we had succeeded.\\" (Sarah > Alexander) The marketing and promotion strategy for the film comprised a direct mail campaign in Sussex, which directed people to the Embrace Life website, which at the time only had a countdown clock and the Embrace Life logo (which represents a stylised seat belt). This generated interest on Twitter and other social networking sites. A poster/flyer campaign in Sussex followed, and the campaign was picked up by the local media in Sussex. At the same time, a council-sanctioned graffiti campaign was undertaken around Brighton and Hove, with Embrace Life logos (some up to 20 feet high) and the Embrace This website address painted by graffiti artist Aroe and his team. (The Embrace Life website address had already been taken, and so was not available. Embrace This was chosen as the alternative.) At the same time a public space art gallery was set up in a disused shop in Horsham. The existing web front page ‚Äì at that time just the countdown clock and the logo ‚Äì was shown on a large plasma screen along with props from the film and stills. These were all designed to give nothing away, to heighten curiosity about the campaign. Children were encouraged to interact by drawing a picture of what made them feel safe, and then to add it to the wall. By the end of the installation, the walls were covered with children‚Äôs drawings, and visitors and participants were given a flier with the campaign's web address. The film was launched on the website on 20 January 2010. The film was put on YouTube by the Sussex Safer Roads Partnership on 29 January 2010. Reception A still from Embrace Life, showing the legend \\"Embrace Life: Always wear your seat belt\\" The lack of dialogue means Embrace Life is accessible to all viewers, no matter what nationality. Once it was put on to the internet it rapidly spread around the globe, gaining over a million views in its first two weeks. By 10 February 2010 international interest in licensing the film for broadcasting on national or province/state TV channels had resulted in enquiries from some Persian Gulf countries, from Brazil, France, Ontario in Canada and from four states in the USA. By 13 February 2010 it had reached 129 different countries, was the 5th top rated video that month on YouTube and was the most top rated YouTube film of all time in the education category. The film was discussed by the British Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety. Comedian Ze Frank blogged about the film, and American Idol presenter Ryan Seacrest also embedded the YouTube film in his website, describing it as \\"beautiful\\", \\"visually arresting\\" and \\"poignant\\". An article in the New York Daily News drew a comparison between the poorly received (and expensive) advertisements during the Super Bowl XLIV on 7 February 2010 and \\"the breath of fresh air\\" of Embrace Life. The film was shown at the TED conference on 13 February in California immediately before James Cameron's speech. Josh Levs on CNN said that he was \\"stunned\\" by the film, \\"which has been praised by people around the world for its beauty.\\" After watching it during his report, a visibly emotional Levs said \\"It gets me every time.\\" The film was featured on The Wanda Sykes Show on Fox on 15 May 2010. On 2 May 2010 it was reported that the Sussex Safer Roads Partnership had received enquiries from bodies such as the United Nations, from European schools and American traffic police, and from major companies about the licensing the film for broadcast. The film's Executive Producer, Neil Hopkins of SSRP commented: \\"From a really small start it's become a global monster. It's smashed all our expectations. We're handling licensing requests from state troopers in the US, big firms like Shell, talk shows, the French government, schools and road safety organisations.\\" The money raised from licensing will be used by the SSRP for further road safety schemes in Sussex. So far, the film has not been shown on British national television as part of a road safety campaign, although it was featured on Live from Studio Five on Five on 19 April 2010 and there is a Facebook campaign to get it shown on British television as part of a road safety campaign. Neil Hopkins said of the film's success: > \\"Originally, we wanted something to run on local cinema screens, on my > workplace‚Äôs website, and on DVDs at educational interventions within our > county. We never dreamed that the campaign would touch so many people.\\" Awards and honours On 12 June 2010 Embrace Life was awarded the 2010 Gold World Medal for Best Digital and Interactive Campaign at the New York Festivals International Advertising Awards ceremony in Shanghai. On 26 June 2010 it won a Bronze award in the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, in the Public Health & Safety category. Embrace Life was also shortlisted for the UK's Chartered Institute of Highways and Transport / Atkins 'Road Safety ‚Äì Reducing All Casualties' Award, in the awards ceremony of 16 June 2010, but did not win. In November 2010 Embrace Life won the inaugural YouTube Advert of the Year Award, winning with three times more votes than its nearest competitor. As of 8 December 2015, Embrace Life has had 19,035,272 views on the Sussex Safer Roads channel on YouTube. Highest honours for the video on YouTube include No. 8 Top Rated (All Time), No. 1 Top Rated (All Time) Education and No. 1 Top Favourited (All Time) Education. It reached its highest Top Rated (All Time) rating in late April-early May 2010.

Background  The state of Alabama had adopted a statutory scheme that imposed alimony obligations on husbands but not on wives for the stated purpose of addressing the economic disparity between men and women by providing support for needy women after divorce. Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Margaret Moses Young filed a brief for the American Civil Liberties Union as amicus curiae urging reversal.  Opinion of the Court  Applying intermediate scrutiny, the Court determined that the statute was not substantially related to the stated purpose. The Court observed that a gender neutral statute would still have the effect of providing for needy women, and that the only difference created by the Alabama statute was to also provide support for well off women that did not need support and to exclude needy men from support.Varat, p. 581  References External links * Category:United States equal protection case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Burger Court Category:1979 in United States case law Category:United States family case law ","title":"Orr v.

On October 15, 1950, U.S. President Harry S. Truman and General Douglas MacArthur met on Wake Island to confer about the progress of the Korean War. Truman decided he would meet MacArthur at Wake Island, \\"so that General MacArthur would not have to be away from the troops in the field for long.\\" During the conference Truman presented MacArthur with his fifth and final Army Distinguished Service Medal. MacArthur's record of being awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal five times has been equaled only by Dwight D. Eisenhower. Truman and MacArthur met privately at the conference and, therefore, there is no record of their conversation. Although the antagonism between the two men is now well known, it is not known what effect, if any, the conference had on their relationship. On October 30, 1950, MacArthur wrote to Truman: > \\"I left the Wake Island conference with a distinct sense of satisfaction > that the county's interests had been well served through the better mutual > understanding and exchange of views which it afforded. I hope it will result > in building a strong defense against future efforts of those who seek for > one reason or another (none of them worthy) to breach the understanding > between us.\\" Despite the understanding achieved between Truman and MacArthur on Wake Island, their agreement would be short lived. They would quickly regress into disagreement with each other over policy in Korea, ultimately resulting in Truman's dismissal of MacArthur. In the book Plain Speaking by Merle Miller, President Truman allegedly stated that his plane and MacArthur's plane arrived at Wake Island at the same time, and that MacArthur's plane kept circling the field in hopes that Truman's plane would land first. Truman also allegedly claimed that MacArthur kept him waiting 45 minutes after he landed. According to eyewitness accounts, however, MacArthur arrived at Wake Island twelve hours ahead of Truman and was waiting for him at the airport when his plane landed.

It is located west of the village on a rocky outcrop, surrounded by vineyards and woods. Today, it serves as a boarding school for students with behavioral problems. The immediately adjacent castle Ruchenstein was demolished in 1643, when the small fort was rebuilt into a Schloss Kasteln. History Kasteln castle in 1860 About 1200 the original fortress Kasteln was built in the middle Schenkenberger valley, a few kilometers away from Schenkenberg Castle. In 1238 the castle is first mentioned in a deed of gift to the residents of the castle who were vassals of the Kyburgs. In 1262 Ruchenstein castle was built on the cliff directly behind the fort for the Knight of Ruchenstein. After the extinction of the Kyburg line in 1264, the castle came under the power of the House of Habsburg. Then in 1301 the Ruchenstein line died out, ten years after they had been given the fort as a gift by the Habsburgs. Both castles were acquired by the lords of M√ºlinen from Brugg. From here, they ruled over a small area on the southern edge of the Jura. The castle belonged to the family of M√ºlinen until 1631 when Johann Ludwig von Erlach bought both castles. The Bernese patrician and general ordered the reconstruction of the castle in 1642 to a representative of manor house. Ruchenstein castle was demolished a year later and served as a building material supplier. Because the builder had no previous expertise, and the client was mostly absent, the conversion proved to be expensive and lasted until 1650. After about a century in the possession of the family of Erlach, in 1732 Bern bought the little bailiwick for 90,000 Taler. It was the smallest bailiwick of the Bernese Aargau, consisting of the villages Auenstein, Oberflachs, Schinznach (now Schinznach-Bad and Schinznach-Dorf) and Villnachern. After the fall of the Ancien R√©gime and the Act of Mediation in 1803, the bailiwick came into possession of the newly formed canton of Aargau. The castle was sold in 1836 to a private citizen. In 1855 the brothers Frederick and Louis Carnival of Aarau acquired the property and opened a \\"rescue institution for orphans and neglected pupils\\" of the Reformed denomination. On 24 August 1907 one of the pupils set the castle and adjacent barn on fire. Both buildings suffered heavy damage and had to be rebuilt. It wasn't until 1909 that the Institute started operations in the manor again. The Institute received the status of a foundation in 1923 and was converted in 1955 in a boarding school for students with behavioral problems. In 1969 next to the castle they built a second school building, swimming pool and a staff house. The entire castle was extensively renovated in 2009 inside and out and adapted to the current needs of the social education. Building Kasteln is the only uniform baroque palace built in the Aargau. The current design is mainly due to the modifications under Johann Ludwig von Erlach. At the core is a four-story medieval castle with two-story wings, from 1642‚Äì50, to the east and west. The wings were built partly from material from the demolished castle Ruchenstein. The unusually rich interior of the castle in 1907 was lost in the fire.

He has also published articles in the fields of Hadith, Islamic law, Salafism, Sufism, and Arabic language. Background and education Brown was born on August 9, 1977 in Washington, DC. He was raised as an Episcopalian and converted to Islam in 1997. Brown is Sunni and follows the Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence. Brown graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in History in 2000 from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., studied Arabic for a year at the Center for Arabic Study Abroad at the American University of Cairo, and completed his doctorate in Islamic thought at the University of Chicago in 2006. Professor Brown is married to Laila Al-Arian, Executive Producer at Al Jazeera. Career From 2006 to 2010 he taught in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilization at the University of Washington in Seattle, where he was awarded tenure. He then gave up tenure to move to Georgetown in 2010. After serving as an assistant professor he was tenured again in 2012 teaching Islamic Studies and Muslim-Christian Understanding in the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. He is also a term member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Brown served as the director of the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding till 2019.Faculty, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim- Christian Understanding Publications and speeches Brown has published work on Hadith, Islamic law, Sufism, Arabic lexical theory and Pre-Islamic poetry and is currently focused on the history of forgery and historical criticism in Islamic civilization and modern conflicts between late Sunni Traditionalism and Salafism in Islamic Thought. Misquoting Muhammad (book) In his book Misquoting Muhammad, Brown argues that the ‚Äúdepth and breadth‚Äù of the early Muslim scholars‚Äô achievement in assessing the authenticity of sayings and texts ‚Äúdwarfed‚Äù that of the fathers of the Christian church. The book received a number of positive reviews, and was named as one of the top books on religion of 2014 by The Independent. One review of the book in a Catholic journal called it \\"generous to a fault when it comes to remarks about Christianity.\\" Writings on slavery In a 2017 article, Brown stated that \\"the term ‚Äòslavery‚Äô is so ambiguous as to be functionally useless for the purposes of discussing extreme domination and exploitation across history,\\" especially in the context of Islamic history. Brown wrote that the current understanding of \\"slavery\\" is defined primarily in terms of legal ownership and violations of autonomy. According to Brown, this understanding does not accurately reflect the way slavery was practiced in many times and places in the Islamic world. For example, some enslaved Ottoman officials held authority over free people, while some forms of extreme exploitation happened to legally free persons. Brown writes that while slavery's evil \\"is so morally clear and so widely acknowledged\\", and that it is the \\"Hitler of human practices\\", he also wishes to challenge the current understanding of slavery. A lecture presenting this article, and in particular comments Brown made during the Q&A; session, sparked criticism from a number of conservative commentators, some of whom accused Brown of supporting slavery and rape. In addition, some liberal scholars of Islam criticized Brown for relativizing the concepts of slavery, human autonomy, and consent, and took issue with his suggestion that Muslims cannot view all historical forms of slavery to be immoral since the Islamic prophet Muhammad had owned slaves. In response, Brown wrote on Twitter, \\"Islam as a faith and I as a person condemn slavery, rape and concubinage.\\" In a subsequent essay and interview Brown elaborated his views and apologized for having addressed the subject too cerebrally, adding that members of the alt- right had bombarded him and his family with threats of death and rape over the controversy.

Underwood, 471 U.S. 222 (1985), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, invalidated the criminal disenfranchisement provision of ¬ß 182 of the Alabama Constitution as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.Varat, J.D. et al. Constitutional Law Cases and Materials, Concise Thirteenth Edition. Foundation Press, NY: 2009, p. 574  Background  Carmen Edwards, an African-American, and Victor Underwood, a White man, had been convicted for the misdemeanor of presenting a worthless check. They were blocked from voting. Their disenfranchisement was mandated by ¬ß 182 of the Alabama Constitution, which disenfranchised persons convicted of \\"any crime ... involving moral turpitude.\\"Varat, p. 574 This part of Alabama's constitution was worked out at a constitutional convention in 1901, and afterwards adopted by a popular referendum. The new provisions in the constitution included a long list of both felonies and misdemeanors which should lead to disenfranchisement, together with the general provision in ¬ß182. In applying this generic paragraph, the Alabama Board of Registrars consulted precedents in the Alabama state court decisions, or asked the Alabama State Attorney for an opinion. Edwards and Underwood contended that the registrar's decision to deny them suffrage violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, since the purpose and effect of this rule was directed against Afro-American suffrage. Lower court decisions Edwards and Underwood sued the Board of Registrars at a Federal District Court. The District Court found that indeed the outspoken purpose of the constitutional change was \\"the disenfranchisement of blacks\\". However, the court could not find it proven that this particular provision was based on racism, and decided against the plaintiffs. Edwards and Underwood appealed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which reversed the decision in their favor. The Court of Appeals held that when the discriminatory purpose had been firmly established, as in this case, the burden was on the defendants to prove that, without this discriminatory purpose, the outcome would have been the same. In the court's opinion, the registrar representatives had failed to do this. The Alabama Board of Registrars, in turn, appealed to the Supreme Court.  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal, and thus struck down the provision as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. The Court identified ¬ß 182 as a facially neutral law with racially disproportionate effects, thus requiring an inquiry to discover if the law was passed with a discriminatory purpose. The provision was adopted at a convention in 1901, and the Court found ample evidence that the law and other measures of the convention were passed with the outspoken intention of disenfranchising practically all African-Americans, from its very start. At the opening address, the chairman of the convention claimed that its purpose was, \\"within the limits imposed by the Federal Constitution, to establish white supremacy in this State\\". This was supported by the minutiae of the proceedings, where delegates repeatedly claim that they did not wish to disenfranchise \\"whites\\", but \\"blacks\\". The appellants claimed that this openly acknowledged purpose was accompanied by an unspoken purpose of disenfranchising \\"poor whites\\". They claimed their true object was for the ruling party, the Southern Democrats, to thwart the Populists and the Republicans, who threatened their political power, by disenfranchising groups of voters who were more inclined to vote for those parties. However, since they needed the \\"white votes\\" to bring through these measures directed against a tangible part of the \\"white electorate\\", the Convention could not openly explain their true purpose. Instead, they exaggerated the purpose of disenfranchising Afro-Americans. The appellants argued then that the disenfranchisement rules were not unconstitutional since the secret, yet ultimate, purpose was to secure the rule of the Southern Democrats by disenfranchising a sufficient amount of their opponents' supporters, independent of their race. They claimed that rewriting the laws for such a purpose was not prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court did not comment on the constitutionality of the purpose that the appellants claimed that the constitutional reform had. Instead, the court noted that the enumerated misdemeanors in the constitution had been chosen with some care, so that they covered many lesser offenses for which mainly black people were convicted, such as petty larceny, while omitting what the court judged to be more serious offenses such as \\"second-degree manslaughter, assault on a police officer, mailing pornography, and aiding the escape of a misdemeanant\\". In the Court's opinion, this established discrimination against Afro-Americans as a major purpose of the constitutional reform (both in words and deeds). Therefore, whether or not there also was a secondary purpose, as outlined by the appellants, would be irrelevant.  See also  * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 222 * Richardson v.

Biography Bolton-born Wharton followed his father Jacky Wharton in becoming a winger in the Football League. His father had played in more than 250 league games for Plymouth Argyle, Preston North End, Manchester City, Blackburn Rovers and Newport County. Wharton joined Wolves on his 15th birthday in 1957 and he turned professional at Molineux in October 1959, two years later scoring on his debut in a 2‚Äì0 home win over Ipswich Town on 11 November 1961, having replaced Mark Lazarus. He then went on to score two more goals when making his debut in the FA Cup, versus Carlisle United in January 1962. He was Wolves' first-choice right winger for the next five-and- a-half seasons. He netted his first hat-trick for the club in March 1963 as fierce rivals West Bromwich Albion were beaten 7‚Äì0. He was in the Wolves side that lost their First Division status in 1964‚Äì65 through to the time the team returned to the First Division two seasons later. In the summer of 1967 Wharton was part of the Wolves team who toured the US playing as the Los Angeles Wolves in the experimental United Soccer Association. Wharton had scored 83 goals in 242 games for Wolves when he joined his hometown club, Bolton Wanderers, for ¬£70,000, the Lancashire club's record buy at the time. Wharton replaced Francis Lee, who had just been sold to Manchester City, and became Bolton's penalty-taker. Early the following season, he hit his first hat-trick for the club in a 4‚Äì2 win over Luton Town.Montreal Gazette. \\"Storm- centre Moore shines in soccer opener\\". 17 August 1970, p. 14.

He left Palace in December 1971 and played in South Africa for Durban City, scoring the opening goal in the South African Cup Final in 1972. In November 1973, he returned to England and joined Walsall; a sole outing as a substitute versus Leyton Orient proved to be his only appearance for the club. Wharton wound down his career in 1974, appearing in three matches for non-league side Kidderminster Harriers during which he scored twice before retiring later that year. After his retirement as a player, Wharton established a fledgling career as a manager, managing Stourbridge, Brewood and Wednesfield in the lower divisions of English football.

Dread debated this issue multiple times on Fox & Friends. The case is still pending in Chancery Court.

Papers relating to the life and the prophecies of Brian Rua, known collectively as \\"Tarngaireacht Bhriain Ruaidh\\" were destroyed, apparently by his own son, who lost his temper with his father when the two had one of their regular disagreements. Brian Rua lived in the parish of Kilcommon in the townland of Inver. Believed to have been born around the year 1648, his story was passed on through oral history in the parish. Brian Rua is reputed to have made a number of prophecies in his lifetime, predicting that \\"Carriages travelling North and South will have iron wheels and the stones on the roads will be talking\\" and \\"Carriages on wheels with smoke and fire will come to Achill and the first and last carriages will carry dead bodies\\". In 1894, the first train on the newly created Achill railway line carried the bodies of 32 young people who died in a drowning tragedy in Clew Bay, an event locals suggest fulfilled the prophecy. In 1906 a renowned Celtic scholar called Michael Timoney from Lahardane set out to collect the story of Brian Rua and publish it, so that it would not be forgotten. The stories were carried down the generations in the Irish language and published in that language. In 2000, as part of the Millennium Project, the story was translated into English and published as part of the book 'Traditional Cures and Gifted People' by Philomena Cronin.

At the age of 17 he was convicted of armed robbery and served time in prison. It was here that he was initiated as a 'vor v zakone', or thief-in- law. By the 1980s he was one of the most prominent thieves-in-law of Moscow.Kommersant - \\"Clean Villa\\" Operation, June 22 2005 In the 1990s Oniani moved to Paris, where he was introduced to Alimzhan Tokhtakhunov. After being charged with several crimes, he moved on to Spain, where he owned stock in an airline and where he ran a construction business employing illegal Georgian immigrants, until in 2005 Spanish police conducted a large scale operation against his organization. Oniani was charged with money laundering, transferring illegal immigrants and organizing a criminal gang, but managed to avoid the sting, while 100 of his workers, 28 members of his gang, including business partner Zakhar KalashovPublico.es - Capo, preso y accionista de Lukoil (Spanish) and even his 12-year-old daughter Gvantsa were detained. It was at around this time he was put on Interpol's list of wanted criminals.

Tensions grew between Oniani and rival crime boss and vor Aslan \\"Grandpa Hassan\\" Usoyan. Around 2007, members of Usoyan's gang started turning up dead, including Armenian national Alek Minalyan, who was allegedly in charge of extorting construction firms working on the 2014 Winter Olympics.TIME Magazine - Will Medvedev's New Laws Help Russia Take Down the Mafia? Oct. 13, 2009 In 2008, in response to the growing violence, a meeting was called on Oniani's private yacht in an attempt to make peace between the two factions. However, Russian authorities were notified of the meeting and used the opportunity to conduct a well-publicised raid and arrest dozens of gangsters.New York Times - In a River Raid, a Glimpse of Russia‚Äôs Criminal Elite, July 30, 2008 The gangsters were paraded in front of media cameras by police before being detained. The yacht meeting did not break up the violence, and the mobsters turned to noted vor Vyacheslav Ivankov to act as a mediator. Ivankov ended up taking the side of the older and more experienced Usoyan, rather than Oniani, whom he saw as a younger upstart. In July 2009, Ivankov was shot by an assassin with a sniper rifle while leaving a restaurant, and died of his wounds a few months later. It is believed his murder was a result of his taking the side of Usoyan in the gangland dispute.The Times - Russia salutes its mafia as the good guys, October 25, 2009 In December 2011, Spanish newspapers reported that Tariel's mansion in Barcelona had been illegally occupied by squatters.

He was also President of the Technical Chamber of Greece. Early years Roussopoulos was born in Athens, the son of Ioannis Roussopoulos, a lawyer from Athens, and Dionysia Veliotis (1871-1955?) of Prasino ca 20 km NW of Levidi in the Peloponnese. He had a sister Eleni Roussopoulos (1911‚Äì1993), lawyer and civil servant, who never married. Professional life In 1930 he was appointed Professor in Applied Statics and Iron Constructions at the National Technical University of Athens, also known as the Athens Polytechnic, where his work was mostly concerned with the development of the theory of aseismic structures, on which he published many papers. He resigned and became Emeritus Professor in 1958 in order to enter political life. He was a leading figure in the reconstruction after the Corinth earthquake of 1928, when he collaborated with the then Bishop of Corinth, Damaskinos. In 1932 he fell ill and went to his mother's village to recuperate. The council there consulted him on a new name for the village (many places in Greece were renamed to get away from their old Ottoman names) and he suggested Prasino, which was adopted. During the war, Roussopoulos was an advisor to the National Organisation of Christian Solidarity set up by the same now Archbishop Damaskinos which was instrumental in saving thousands from starvation or execution, and he also took the dangerous office of President of the secret organisation of National Solidarity which had been founded by the EAM movement to collect food, money and clothing for the resistance fighters. In December 1944 three professors, including the Rector Ioannis Theophanopoulos, and twelve students of the Athens Polytechnic were arrested, taken to the mountains and executed by an ELAS band. At the Rector's public funeral, Roussopoulos gave the funerary speech in which he expressed: \\"... Shame to our precious vision of social justice, which was greatly dishonored and soiled from acts that were carried out in its name. We cannot accept the excuse that at great shifts of human history revolutions necessitate victims, because we have behind us a century of rapid and positive development which has changed this account of life and created such spiritual resurgence that it is no longer necessary for humanity to pass through the debris of human barbarity to carry on. ...\\". He was President of the Technical Chamber of Greece from 1951 to 1958, when he put forward radical new projects that were vetoed by American advisers because they paralleled Hjalmar Schacht's approach to public finances. After the great 1953 Ionian earthquake he introduced a system of shoring up the shattered walls of the houses in Lefkada with corrugated iron, a paradoxically attractive feature still of many houses in the city. This successfully withstood the next big earthquake of 2003. Between 1928 and 1966 he published 36 studies and books on technical subjects, of which several have been translated into English, French and German. He also wrote many influential books about the philosophy of science and life. The first, in 1936, was \\"To Construct and to Rejoice - towards essential reasoning and order\\".L. M. Michaelides: Introduction to \\"The issue of production paper currency and the abolition of personal income tax\\", A. I Roussopoulos 1983. Political life In 1961 he was elected as a Member of Parliament for the Center Union (Greek: ŒàŒΩœâœÉŒ∑ ŒöŒ≠ŒΩœÑœÅŒøœÖ) party led by George Papandreou the elder, and re-elected in 1964. After the crisis of 1965 (the Apostasia) he joined the short-lived government formed by Stephanos Stephanopoulos and became Minister of Public Works in 1966. When a military junta ('the Colonels') took power in 1967, he was one of the many intellectuals arrested, sacked from their posts then confined to restricted residence. He then started what he called an informal new 'Plato's Academy' - his old students would gather at his house in Athens and his teaching continued there. He did not return to Parliament after the return to democracy in 1974 but retired from public life and died in Athens on 1 June 1983. Personal life With Dr Calliope Caldis (1906‚Äì1990), daughter of Georgios Emmanouil Kaldis (1875‚Äì1953), MP for Lesbos and Lemnos, he had a son George (b. 1941). He then married Xeni Soldatou (?-1985) of Lefkada and had two sons, Alexandros (1943‚Äì2008) and Andreas (1946‚Äì2004).

First organized as a congregation in 1845, St. Stephen's counts itself among the oldest anglophone churches in West Quebec. Church History St. Stephen's was first built as a wooden church by the English and Scottish settlers of Buckingham, Quebec in 1852. Under the direction of the Anglican Diocese of Montreal, Anglican missionaries began organizing a congregation in the rural logging settlement in the early 1840s. With the impending construction of the first church in the region sponsored by The Church of England, the area welcomed its first full-time Anglican priest, Rev. Richard L. Stevenson, in 1850.Pierre Louis-Laporte, \\"In the heart of the Lower Lievre District the City of Buckingham from its earliest beginnings: 1824-1990,\\" (Buckingham: Love Printing Services, 1990), 69. . With the support of a growing anglophone population, a larger stone church was erected in 1899 to replace the wooden building built by the early settlers. This second church continues to be used for worship and community events to this day. The Diocese of Montreal formally transferred oversight of the Parish of Buckingham, comprising St. Stephen's and St. Thomas Anglican Church, Silver Creek, Quebec, to the Anglican Diocese of Ottawa in the mid-twentieth century. St. Stephen's, along with its rural counterpart in Silver Creek, are currently associated with the Diocese of Ottawa's Parish of the Eastern Outaouais, a multi-point parish where liturgical and administrative services are also shared with St. George's Gatineau, St. John's in the Wilderness (Glen Almond) and Christ Church Poltimore.See Diocese of Ottawa website for further Details Church Today The church is designaged as a chapel of ease connected to the Parish of Chelsea-Lascelles-Wakefield. Services are scheduled seasonally, and are led by either an ordained Anglican priest or a licensed lay reader. The church is also available by request for weddings, funerals, baptisms, confirmations and other such occasions. The church's Toope Memorial Hall, built in the 1960s with the support of the Erco Chemical Company and dedicated to the memory of The Rev. Frank Toope and his wife Jocelyn, is a popular community centre that is often rented out to local residents and groups for large receptions and other activities. The priest-in-charge of St. Stephen's is the Rev. Elizabeth Jeannie Loughrey, who serves as Incumbent of the Parish of Chelsea-Lascelles- Wakefield in the Gatineau Hills. St. John's Chapel In 2013, under the leadership of churchwardens John Carson and Barbara Elliott -- and following a donation of sanctuary furnishings from the former St. John's Quyon -- the parishioners of St. Stephen's transformed their former Sunday School room into a beautifully appointed winter chapel. Named in honour of the Quyon congregation, \\"St. John's Chapel\\" was officially opened by the Archdeacon of Clarendon, the Venerable Sally Gadd, on November 24, 2013, and blessed by the Rt. Rev. Dr. John H. Chapman, Bishop of Ottawa, on May 8, 2016. Camp ARK & Ecumenical Youth Activities St. Stephen's first sponsored an ecumenical Daily Vacation Bible School called \\"Camp ARK: Acts of Random Kindness,\\" for children ages 5 to 13 from August 9 to 12 2010 at St. Stephen's Church Hall, Buckingham. The camp, which was a great success, also received financial support from St. Stephen's and St. John's Glen Almond. In total, fourteen children attended the first camp. The second edition of Camp ARK was held from August 8 to 11 2011; forty-five children attended the second edition of the program. Camp ARK 2012 was held from August 13th to 16th 2012 at St. Andrew's United Church and included 51 students. In 2013 Camp ARK returned to St. Stephen's and hosted a record seventy-one students between August 12th and 15th. Following a one-year hiatus, Camp Ark returned in 2015 and hosted a further fifty campers. Building on the camp's numerous years of success, three of Buckingham's English speaking Christian communities (Our Lady of Victory Roman Catholic, St. Andrew's United and the Anglican Parish of Eastern Outaouais) now offer a joint youth group on the first Friday of every month, \\"The Friday Night Faith Buddies,\\" and an ecumenical Sunday School on the first Sunday of every month. Parents desiring information should contact the St. Stephen's churchwardens or visit the parish's Facebook page. Christmas Bazaar In the late fall the congregation hosts a popular Christmas bazaar in partnership with St. John's Anglican Church Glen Almond. Cemetery Memorial Service St. Stephen's annual Cemetery Memorial service is typically held on the fourth Sunday in September at 2pm. Visitors are encouraged to confirm event scheduling with the churchwardens.

They are similar to fresh corn tortillas, but are slightly thicker and usually oblong/oval in shape. Memela is the Oaxacan local name for the almost identical sope and huarache served in other parts of Mexico, but with different toppings. The corn masa is flattened with a tortilla press, pinched to create indentations along its borders, then placed over a hot comal or griddle. When the tortilla-like base is cooked and charred where the dough hits the hot metal of the grill and becomes as chewy as a medium-well steak, it is then topped with black beans, salsa, shredded cabbage, mole negro, guacamole, and cheese. Although the traditional memela is supposed to be topped with no other additional ingredients, those toppings now vary from recipe to recipe. Modern incarnations include other vegetables and the option of a layer of tinga (shredded chicken with tomatoes, onions, and chiles) or potatoes and sausage. Memelas have been served at Oaxacan/Mexican restaurants in the United States since the 1990s. Other varieties In El Salvador, a memela is a thick and oval shaped tortilla.

In 1980, the Argentinian arachnologist Mar√≠a Elena Galiano transferred the species to the genus Zygoballus. Because the name Zygoballus sexpunctatus was already in use, Galiano gave the species a new name, Zygoballus melloleitaoi, in honor of Mello-Leit√£o.

He maintained a varied program: his company knew most of the Bard's plays and no production was played on consecutive nights. For instance, they performed thirteen plays at His Majesty's Theatre, Perth from April to May 1926. A remarkable feature of their schedule was an annual Christmas season at the Theatre Royal, Hobart at a time when Tasmania was almost universally bypassed by touring companies. A serious setback occurred in June 1926, when the Geelong, Victoria Mechanics' Institutehttp://www.liveperformance.com.au/halloffame/allanwilkie2.html burned down with all his wardrobes and what few props and scenery they carried.

From 1922 to 1924 he published The Shakespearean Quarterly, sold in the foyer of theatres where they performed, claimed the only such magazine published in the British Empire. Hector Bolitho was editor for a short time. He was appointed a CBE in May 1925, at the beginning of their season at the Theatre Royal, Brisbane. The honour was in recognition of his services to the theatre and, especially, education.http://www.adelaide.edu.au/library/special/theatre/theatre_bib.html The publicity resulted in an extended season of two months. (Wilkie was adept at extracting benefit for his Company from patronage of the wealthy and famous.) Another lucrative venue was The Majestic, Newtown, where they ran extended seasons in 1928 and 1929. He disbanded his troupe in October 1930Sydney Morning Herald 4 October 1930 at the onset of the Great Depression, (though competition from the \\"talkies\\" would have contributed, as would the increasing percentage of his audiences who paid the greatly reduced students' admission.

Frediswyde died in 1951 after suffering chronic illness, and he remarried at age 87 and died at 91. He was often criticised for his declamatory style of acting, notably by The Triad which compared him unfavourably to his contemporary Gregan McMahon, but no-one ever doubted his sincerity and energy. \\"He travelled further and laboured harder to bring classic theatre to Australian audiences ... Without Wilkie, Australian theatre during World War I and after would have been the poorer.\\" (John West, op cit.) Legacy Among Wilkie players who went on to achieve later success were Frank Clewlow, Lorna Forbes, Marie Ney, Augustus Neville, Leslie Manners, John CairnsThe Argus 29 October 1928 and Ellis Irving. The renowned writer Ngaio Marsh acted with his troupe for a time, and remained a friend and correspondent. The actor/manager John Alden has been described as \\"a latter-day Wilkie\\". The Allan Wilkie ‚Äì Frediswyde Hunter-Watts Theatre Collection in the Barr Smith Library of the University of Adelaide (donated by Angel Symon) is named for them. Though much younger, Angel was a longtime friend and correspondent, and spent some years as his advance publicity agent.

Malacologia 47(1-2). . 397 pp. Prior to 2011, both the subfamilies Mangeliinae and Oenopotinae had been placed in the family Conidae. In 2011, Bouchet, Kantor et al merged the two subfamilies into one taxon, which they elevated to the rank of family. This was based on anatomical characters and a dataset of molecular sequences of three gene fragments. Mangeliidae is a sister-clade to the family Raphitomidae As with their relatives in the family Conidae, species in the family Mangelidae use potent venoms to catch their prey. Through this characteristic, they are of interest in pharmacological research. Description This family is characterized in general by usually the lack of an operculum, by a deep anal sinus on the subsutural ramp and with a heavy callus on the shoulder slope of the outer lip. The Mangeliidae are small to medium-sized gastropods (length usually smaller than 30 mm). The high-spired shell has a fusiform to an oval or biconical shape. The protoconch is helicoid, with a very small initial, and rapidly increasing subsequent whorls. The spire is usually comparatively low. The shoulders of the whorls are often angular. The axial ribs are dominant in the sculpture of the shell. The spiral sculpture often consists of fine striae with a microsculpture of spirally aligned granules (especially on the subsutural ramp). The texture of the adult shell is frequently \\"gritty,\\" from a sculpture of minute grains. The aperture is oval-elongated, usually narrow, terminating in a rather short, truncated siphonal canal. The aperture is only rarely denticulate. The outer lip (labrum) is reinforced. The varix is usually well developed, and the fasciole evanescent. A series of pustules on the columella is an ordinary feature. The toxoglossate radula has a weak basal ribbon and relatively short marginal teeth with very variable morphology (from semi-enrolled to true hypodermic). The tooth cavity opens laterally.Chen-Kwoh Chang, Small Turrids of Taiwan, chapter 12, p. 116; June, 1 2001, pls 42-56 However, the genera Neoguraleus and Liracraea are operculate; the operculum in these genera has a terminal nucleus. These exceptions mean that the reinforced outer lip is the most characteristic feature of this family. The species in this family occurred from the Paleogene to Recent.

Plot  Ben Westman is a widower father of a daughter, Lindsay, and a son, Dylan. He is extremely busy and has very little time for his children, for whom he hired a housekeeper/nanny that works all day long in his house. Being abruptly fired from the firm that he co- founded 20 years ago, he decides not to look for another housekeeper to replace Nula, that has decided to leave the job abruptly, as well. Thinking that he could stay home to take care of his kids and to do all the house work, Ben finds himself in trouble for not knowing how to do all the every day jobs required in a large house. Little by little, as Ben cooks, cleans and raises his pre-teen son Dylan, he becomes more skilled in doing all the jobs, which were previously carried out by his wife and, after her death, by Nula. Behaving in an \\"ungentlemanly manner\\" at school, Dylan comes into conflict with some classmates of his. Ben has to be present at school to discuss the matter in person. After meeting with the principal, Ben meets Dylan's teacher, Hope Jensen. The two rapidly connect with each other on a personal, sentimental and emotional level. Even though the children need desperately a firm fatherly hand, they also need a maternal presence and understanding. Ben's daughter Lindsay (14), who needs some space in order to be with her friend Brandon, seeks the understanding of a woman. With some little help that comes from Ben's brother, Brian, and Hope, the relationship among the father and the two children improves constantly. At the same time, Hope becomes Ben's first post-widowing date and his girlfriend. Being offered a job in Cleveland, Ohio, Ben decides to move with the children in the city where the job will be. After some second thoughts, realizing that he would lose Hope as well as the unique bond created among the four of them, he decides to stay and keep what he has gotten; a lovely woman, that is entirely accepted and embraced by the children.

This application achieves this through various analogy mapping techniques, and is a standard client-server application that runs on a Windows computer but may connect to non-Windows servers. CubePort converts the various OLAP structures and syntaxes in the source through an extraction process, interprets, and recreates in the target. The objective is to simulate exactly the behavior of the original source system to the target system. The application also includes UI phases such as Authentication, Questions, Extraction, and Verification. Substantial testing normally occurs after the conversion process prior to posting the objects to production. History The software was released widely in 2005. CubePort represents the first product of its kind in the Business intelligence platform migration space. The product was design and created to provide an organization with the ability to move their Business Intelligence assets from one platform to another. Unlike the RDBMS (relational databases) world where there exists the commonplace ability to migrate from one RDBMS product type to another, in the Business Intelligence or OLAP product space, this capability is currently not found in the marketplace. Usage Motivations Motivations for migrating from one Business Intelligence platform to another, regardless of whether this is achieved through automated or manual methods, vary from implementation to implementation, and may include one or more of the following motivations: * Reduction of licensing or recurring maintenance expense * Increase of detail- level of the cube * Increase of the user count * Elimination of cube load and calculation time constraints * Elimination of pervasive vendor lock-in scenario * Standardization towards Microsoft BI platform, where appropriate Objects Converted CubePort Simple Diagram These standard objects in a cube are converted by the software with varying levels of robustness: * Cube Outline * Cube Data Loads and Dimension Builds * Cube Security Model * Cube Substitution Variables * Cube Calculation Scripts * Cube Report Scripts The output objects of a successful run of CubePort are: A relational Star schema and/or relational Snowflake schema, OLAP cube, Etl load packages, MDX (Multidimensional Expressions) files, and others.

This specifically targeted tax avoidance schemes that made use of offshore trusts and double taxation treaties to reduce the tax paid by the scheme's users. These schemes were heavily marketed to the freelance community after the introduction of intermediaries legislation known as IR35, as they appeared to offer more certainty concerning tax liabilities than would be the case if running a limited company. In introducing S58 the government retrospectively changed the law so that not only could these schemes not operate in future but they were effectively made unlawful from the day they were first introduced.  Origins of BN66  BN66 has its origins in the result of Padmore vs IRC.Padmore v IRC (1987) STC 36 affirmed by the Court of Appeal (1989) STC 493 This case challenged the decision of an Inland Revenue Special Commissioner that a UK resident member of an offshore partnership, in this case based in Jersey, should be liable for UK income tax on earnings received from the partnership. The challenge was based on the premise that under the provisions of a double taxation agreement between the UK and Jersey, the UK taxpayer should be exempt from UK income tax. The commissioners' decision was based on the opinion that as the taxpayer was neither resident, nor did they carry out business in Jersey, they should not be eligible for relief under dual taxation agreements and were thus liable for full UK income tax on earnings from the partnership. The judge in the case upheld the appeal on the basis that for the purposes of the arrangement under the double taxation agreement, a partnership was clearly a \\"body of persons\\" in the ordinary sense of the words. This partnership was resident in Jersey, since it was managed and controlled there, and its profits were the industrial or commercial profits of a Jersey enterprise exempt from UK tax. Thus the shares of those profits attributable to UK resident partners were also exempt. This decision was later upheld in the Court of Appeal. As a result of this the government at the time introduced legislation in the Finance Act (No. 2) 1987 to close this loophole retrospectively, with the exception of Mr Padmore. This meant that UK resident members of foreign partnerships could no longer benefit from double taxation treaties in relation to the profits from those partnerships.  A change of tactics  Following the 1987 legislation new schemes were conceived whereby offshore trusts would be set up with foreign trustees, who would then form partnerships, as opposed to UK resident trustees. UK residents would then be beneficiaries of this trust without being members of the partnership. In July 2002 HMRC issued a Technical Exchange (Issue 63) advising tax offices that they were aware of several hundred people intending to use such a scheme. However legislation to target these schemes would not be brought in until 2008.  Budget Note 66  In March 2008, the government announced in its budget that abuse of double taxation agreements would be addressed, and indicated its intention via Budget Note 66 (or BN66 as it is more commonly referred to). This included the changes to be made to clause 55 of the Finance Bill 2008 specifically intended to remove the ability for beneficiaries of foreign trusts to exploit double taxation treaties. At the time of the announcement the government characterised these changes as \\"clarification\\" of the law rather than as retrospective changes. The proposals in BN66 closed the loophole that made these schemes legal. It did this not only prospectively but was also applied with retrospective effect to the legislation passed in 1987, which was in itself retrospective. The key difference between this change and that applied to the 1987 legislation is that the earlier changes exempted those who would have otherwise been retrospectively caught by the legislation (specifically Mr Padmore). In the case of section 58 this change was applied without exemption. This meant that many people who had been using tax avoidance schemes in the belief that they were legal in the wake of the Padmore decision and the legislation that followed it, found themselves facing large tax bills due to this retrospective application.  Implementation  On 21 July 2008 the Finance Bill was enacted as the Finance Act 2008, becoming law with effect from that date. The changes introduced as clause 55 of the bill became section 58 of the Act (UK Residents and Foreign Partnerships). Section 58 amended a number of earlier Acts of Parliament : * The Income and Corporation Tax Act 1988 * The Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 * The Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 Text of section 58 of the Finance Act 2008 > 58 UK residents and foreign partnerships. # In section 115 of ICTA > (partnerships involving companies: supplementary), after subsection (5B) > insert‚Äî #:‚Äú(5C) For the purposes of subsections (5) to (5B) the members of a > partnership include any company which is entitled to a share of income or > capital gains of the partnership.‚Äù # In section 59 of TCGA 1992 > (partnerships), insert at the end‚Äî #:\\"(4) For the purposes of subsections > (2) and (3) the members of a partnership include any person entitled to a > share of capital gains of the partnership.\\" # In section 858 of ITTOIA 2005 > (resident partners and double taxation agreements), insert at the end‚Äî > #:\\"(4) For the purposes of this section the members of a firm include any > person entitled to a share of income of the firm.‚Äù # The amendments made by > subsections (1) to (3) are treated as always having had effect. # For the > purposes of the predecessor provisions, the members of a partnership are to > be treated as having included, at all times to which those provisions > applied, a person entitled to a share of income or capital gains of the > partnership. # ‚ÄúThe predecessor provisions‚Äù means‚Äî #:(a) section 153(4) and > (5) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 #:(c. 10) (as it had effect > under section 62(2) of F(No.2)A 1987), and #:(b) sections 112(4) to (6) and > 115(5) of ICTA.  Retrospection  By including S58(4) \\"The amendments made by subsections (1) to (3) are treated as always having had effect\\" these changes were effectively made retrospective, rendering any use of avoidance schemes such as those set up after Padmore and the Finance (No. 2) Act 1987 illegal irrespective of the law at the time they were conceived or entered into.  Legal challenges  A number of cases, from various legal angles, have been brought against HMRC contesting the retrospective nature of BN66: * Montpelier * Steed / KPMG * PWC * A wealth management company that has teamed up with KPMG and Ernst & Young The UK Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) has also expressed its concern over the retrospective nature of BN66 and that no adequate justification for such retrospection had been provided.

The castle is in Llanvihangel Crucorney, about five miles to the north of Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, in south east Wales and lies between the Usk and Monnow rivers. The mound was designated a scheduled monument in 1950 and described as a defensive medieval motte. Surroundings The castle mound is adjacent to Pen-y-Clawdd Court (a Grade I listed building), a stable and cowshed with adjoining range, and a barn, all of which are Grade II listed buildings. These buildings, along with the castle mound, are set in a roughly rectangular area about 150m by 135m. This area is a possible location for the bailey part of the castle. Some of the features of the mound may have been changed by landscaping around the later buildings. History Very little is known of the exact origins of the castle, but it may have been built by Roger de Hastings during the 11th century, as one of a number of forts created after the Revolt of the Earls in 1075. However, no contemporary evidence of occupation of the site exists up to 1349 when, for half a knight's fee, Walter de Kymbard held the site from Laurence de Hastings, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who was also Baron [A]Bergavenny. The adjacent Pen-y-Clawdd Court was probably built early in the 16th century and extended and remodelled early in the 17th century. The farm buildings were added later; cowshed (early 18th century), barn (mid 18th century), and stable and range (early 19th century). Investigation and interpretation The site was surveyed (topographic and geophysical), along with a number of other earthwork sites, between December 1999 and February 2001. Excavations were carried out in 2002 and 2003. The surveys and excavations suggested that there was a large rectangular masonry structure on the mound which suffered fire damage and partly collapsed. The stones may have been used when Pen-y-Clawdd Court was built. Phillips suggests that the site is a fortified house from a later period, but may have been preceded by a motte and bailey. Both Remfry and Phillips note that the position of the site below a hill is not a usual choice for a motte and bailey and find it \\"an awkward site to interpret\\" and \\"puzzling\\". Salter classes the motte as a medieval fortified site rather than a castle.

All of Cirque du Soleil's previous touring productions were originally created to be performed inside large, custom-designed tents (called the grand chapiteau), but many of those shows have since been re-staged in arenas and other venues after the conclusion of their \\"big top\\" tour. Totem's creation team faced the challenge of designing a show that could be adapted for arenas and other venues from the outset. Set and technical information Cirque du Soleil used interactive projection technologies to enhance and provide variety to the types of scenes created for Totem, including swamps, starry nights, lakes, volcanos, and other natural environments. The kinetic images are created with the help of infrared cameras; the projection system can dynamically create projections, making it seem as if they are reacting to the artists' movements in both real-time and pre-recorded sequences. One of the major elements for the set is the large turtle carapace, which functions as both a decorative piece as well as acrobatic equipment. When not in use, the shell is tilted or raised completely to the top of the tent or arena. It weighs , has two horizontal bars, and is covered in a non-slip finish. Another major component of the set is the \\"scorpion bridge\\", which functions as an entrance at times. It is made of of steel and has eight mineral oil hydraulic motors which allow it to move in three dimensions--extending, retracting, curling, etc. Underneath said bridge is housing for a laser, speakers, lighting equipment, and cameras. Movement of the scorpion bridge is controlled by an operator who uses four infrared cameras. Of final note, the marsh reeds at the back of the stage are actually inflatable, which allows for easier transport between performance locations. Equipment and props that are not part of the set have been just as carefully planned out and created. The unicycles are tall, but are very light for better maneuverability. Similarly, the perch poles were made of duralumin, the largest of which was tall. In total summation, Totem utilizes 65 tractor-trailer sized containers to transport its of equipment from site to site. During the Scientist's juggling act, he uses balls made with 96 red, 96 blue, and 96 green LED lights inside. The colors are changed remotely by show technicians during the performance. Cast Fifty-two performing artists from 19 countries make up the cast as of Totem's premi√®re. * The Tracker: Assists and guides the Scientist, and is a friend to the animals. * The Scientist: Performs experiments and visits the different worlds of Totem. Appearance is based on Charles Darwin. * The Amerindian dancer: Traces the evolution of species. * The Crystal man: Opens the show by bringing the carapace to life, and ends the show by diving into the lagoon. * The Sad Fisherman: This clown performs ping-pong ball tricks and drives the speedboat. * Valentino: This \\"Italian Tourist\\" acts as a foil to the Tracker and water-skis from the speedboat. * Apes: A troupe of 5‚Äì6 characters mark the progress of Human Evolution from Ape to Businessman With Cell Phone. Acts Totem's acts feature unique presentations of high-caliber circus skills and other performing arts. * Carapace: A traditional gymnastics apparatus with use of a trampoline ground for a twist. * Hoops Dancer Part 1: A fast paced Native American hoop dance featuring one of two solo artist. * Rings trio: A traditional gymnastics act featuring a high flying trio using sheer strength and flexibility to create multiple poses. * Unicycles with Bowls: A group of female artists ride seven foot high unicycles while balancing metal bowls on their heads. The performers place a bowl on their foot, and kick it back to the head. The act consisted of kicking two or even five bowls at once, kicking bowls to people in front or behind them and even kicking a teapot onto one performers head. * Contortion: One contortionist uses balance, strength and flexibility in this jaw dropping feat of contortion on a circular platform. * Escalade: A businessman, stripped of his suit is trapped deep in the jungle. Jumping and climbing around a Chinese-pole-like framework, as if swinging through the trees, he finds his inner, primitive, ape. * Diabolo: The Tracker manipulates diabolos (i.e., Chinese yo-yo), which are two sticks linked by a string on which a wooden spool balances. * Fixed trapeze Duo: A young couple perform death-defying stunts high up on a trapeze. The act represents both the desire and aggravation couples face. * Crystal Ladies: Using flat squares made of fabric material, an artists perform an antipodism act while spinning these squares on her hands and legs, throwing the squares from one foot/hand to the other. Due to maternal leave, the act was performed as a solo from 2016 to 2017. It was then temporarily removed to reintegrate the act as a duet. The full act premiered again in April 2019 in Vienna. https://www.facebook.com/(null)?metadata=yh1BgkdXdtkd53Hy9cCgACO3/ewt4Rfio9TBEz1l1D8dIIuNw8mhxSqxGoLEpm3Fh1ZqnUVvwF++pHMgNmjUpYmNitFo7OcD&sfns;=mo * Manipulation: The Scientist rolls several LED lit balls in a giant glass cone, creating a whole new take on the average juggling act. * Hoops Dancer Part 2: Two performers dance with hoops in a pounding, percussion-heavy dance. * Roller skates: A couple create stunning poses as they skate on a platform at high speed. * Russian Bars: A nerve-wracking act that involves four-inch thick planks that artists use to jump high in the air while performing flips, only to land perfectly on the bar again.

Used as a rotation act until December 2018. * Perches: Several performers climb up high poles that are balanced on an artists shoulder. This act was removed in 2013. * Devil sticks: The tracker manipulates a long stick with two other sticks that he holds onto, both accuracy and timing are used in this energetic act. This act was performed until 2015 before being replaced by Diabolos. * Hand-to-Hand: A duo perform a traditional hand to hand act, they keep the act at a heartbeat like rhythm. This act was performed until November 2015 before being replaced by Escalade and Contortion. * Hand balancing: An artist precariously balances on a high hand balancing platform, using contortion and gymnastic techniques. This act was performed until 2017 before being replaced in 2018 by Cyr Wheel. Costumes As Totem's storyline includes the evolution of humanity, inspiration for the 779 costume elements came directly from nature. Costume designer Kym Barrett primarily focused on how to treat various fabrics rather than the materials themselves in order to replicate the elements found in nature. Such treatments included advanced printing techniques, fluorescent pigments, and utilizing mirror fragments and crystals for adornment. Below is more detailed information about specific costume pieces and the wardrobe collection as a whole. * The Crystal Man's stretch velvet leotard is encrusted with nearly 4,500 reflective components; 4,001 are mirror fragments. This costume is the show's heaviest, weighing eight pounds. * The foot juggling duo's lycra body stockings are each adorned with 3,500 crystals, and each headpiece has another 1,000. * The hoop dancer's costume is inspired by not one traditional Native American tribe, but by several. For instance it includes a Hopi cross and headdress. * The unicyclists each have a very distinct look that suggests autumn and the abundance from harvest. Each costume is printed with earth tones and then embellished with hand-sewn details, including bolts, screws, seedpods, feathers, flowers and insects. Music As Totem's storyline is about the evolution of humanity, the musical components selected by composers Guy Dubuc and Marc Lessard aimed to reflect this theme. Their score includes instruments and rhythms from around the world, including elements from Native American music, Spanish flamenco, and Indian music. One unique attribute of the music in Totem is that all the musicians sing at some point, which allows for moments of a cappella. Below are the track titles as they appear in order on the CD, which was originally released on October 6, 2010.

Most critical editions of the Greek New Testament give precedence to these two chief uncial manuscripts, and the majority of translations are based on their text. Nevertheless, there are many differences between these two manuscripts. According to Dean Burgon: \\"It is in fact easier to find two consecutive verses in which these two MSS differ the one from the other, than two consecutive verses in which they entirely agree.\\"Dean John W. Burgon, Revision Revised (1883), p. 12 According to Herman C. Hoskier,Herman C. Hoskier, Codex B and its Allies, Bernard Quaritch, London 1914. there are, without counting errors of iotacism, 3,036 textual variations between Sinaiticus and Vaticanus in the text of the Gospels alone, enumerated as follows: :Matthew: 656 :Mark: 567 :Luke: 791 :John: 1022 Hoskier noted in his book: \\"I make a present to Gregory and Souter of the 'provincial' exchange of œâœÇ and œâœÉœÄŒµœÅ, œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ± and Œ±œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ±, œâœÇ and œâœÉŒµŒπ, ŒµŒΩŒ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒøŒΩ and ŒµŒΩœâœÄŒπŒøŒΩ, ŒµœÉœÑŒ∑Œ∫ŒøœÑœâŒΩ and ŒµœÉœÑœâœÑœâŒΩ, ŒµŒ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ and Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ, ŒºŒµ and ŒµŒºŒµ, ŒøŒπŒ∫ŒπŒ±ŒΩ and ŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøŒΩ, ŒµœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ and Œ±ŒªŒªŒøŒΩ and Œ±ŒªŒªŒ∑ŒªŒøŒΩ, œÄŒπŒµŒπŒΩ and œÄŒµŒπŒΩ and œÄŒπŒΩ, Œ∑œÖŒ¥ŒøŒ∫Œ∑œÉŒµŒΩ and ŒµœÖŒ¥ŒøŒ∫Œ∑œÉŒµŒΩ, ŒµœÖŒ∏œÖœÇ and ŒµœÖŒ∏ŒµœâœÇ, œÉœÄœÖœÅŒπŒ¥Œ±œÇ and œÉœÜœÖœÅŒπŒ¥Œ±œÇ, Œ∫Œ±Œ≥œâ and Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒµŒ≥œâ, œÖœÄŒøŒ∫Œ±œÑœâ and œÖœÄŒøœÄŒøŒ¥ŒπŒøŒΩ, ŒµŒ±ŒΩ and Œ±ŒΩ, Œ±œÄŒø and œÖœÄŒø, œÄœÅŒøœÇ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖœÇ and Œ±œÖœÑŒøŒπœÇ, ŒµœÄŒπ and ŒµŒπœÇ, ŒπŒΩŒ± and ŒøœÄœâœÇ.\\"Herman C. Hoskier, Codex B and its Allies, Bernard Quaritch, London 1914, p. 1. According to contemporary scholars, these two manuscripts represent two different textual families of the Alexandrian text-type. John has more differences than the other gospels because in Codex Sinaiticus, John 1:1‚Äì8:38 and parts of chapters 16 and 21 have early Western Christian writing ancestry.Fee, G. D. (1968-9). Codex Sinaiticus in the Gospel of John, NTS 15, pp. 22-44. Further comparative study of these two Alexandrian manuscripts show scientifically that they originated from an earlier exemplar that was of the Byzantine text type. Multiple studies have shown that when these two manuscripts disagree one with the other, which they do frequently, one or the other manuscript will almost always agree with the Traditional, Majority Byzantine text. If one is looking for the original text, it should be sought within a living and consistently transmitted extant text; it is not possible that it will be found within a non-academic, highly subjective, and newly fabricated text, such as the Nestle Aland (NA28) or the United Bible Society (UBS5) text. These texts are very similar by agreement, but often they have no extant manuscript support across a small part of scripture (within a single verse or more often than not in the case of only a few consecutive verses). Codex Sinaiticus is designated by siglum ◊ê, and Codex Vaticanus by alpha character B.

His successful career has led to him being dubbed the ‚ÄúKing of the Super Bowl\\" Buckley's directorial debut came with a series of commercials he created for NHL on ESPN, before creating the ‚ÄúThis is SportsCenter‚Äù campaign for ESPN in 1999. The work became an part of the ESPN brand, and launched Buckley into the commercial world. Buckley would go on to direct 64 Super Bowl Commercials. He has directed two feature films and four short films. Of his four shorts, Krug (2004) played at Sundance, Wake Up Caller (2004) played at Tribeca, while ASAD (2013) and SARIA (2019) have been nominated for Best Live Action Short Film at the Academy Awards. His two nominations in the same decade is the first time a director has managed to return to the category in over 30 years. His first feature film The Bronze (2015), opened the 2015 Sundance Film Festival, while his second, Pirates of Somalia (2017), premiered at the Tribeca film festival. A 2010 Adweek Readers Poll named Buckley the Commercial Director of the Decade - he was also named one of the 50 best Creative Minds in the last 25 years by Creativity Magazine.  Personal life  Bryan Buckley was born on September 3, 1963 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He spent his first years in Sudbury, a suburb of Boston, before moving in 1970 to live on a farm in Madbury, New Hampsire. His father, a onetime Army reservist, worked as an art director in a small regional ad agency and later became chair of Boston's New England school of Art. His mother worked as a top promotional executive at Jordan Marsh department store. His parents were both activists involved in the anti-war and Civil Rights movements on the 1960s. In 1976, his parents separated and he returned to Massachusetts with his mother. In his senior year of high school, Buckley was selected to the Short Term Institute at Phillips Andover preparatory school on a full art scholarship. He was then admitted to Syracuse University's design program - he finished his first class in Advertising Design there in 1985, but never enrolled in a film class during his time in college. In 2017, Buckley married actress Kiana Madani. He has three children.  Early career  After graduating Syracuse, Buckley began as an entry-level art director at Doyle Dane Bernbach. In 1988, he co-founded his own agency, Buckley / DeCerchio, with his Chiat/Day co- worker Tom DeCerchio. Their first client was the 4 million dollar Godfather's Pizza account. Buckley and De Cerchio then hired friends and filmmakers who would work cheaply. Within a few months, Buckley and De Cerchio were on the cover of Adweek. In their first year open, their work for Godfather's Pizza was awarded with a Gold Pencil at the One Show, an advertising awards show. The agency would go on to sign clients such as Yugo cars and Snapple, for whom they created the famous ‚ÄúMade From the Best Stuff on Earth National‚Äù tag. In December 1993, Buckley and DeCerchio made the cover of the New York Times Business Section. The next day they announced that a new chapter had begun, and closed the agency.  This Is Sportscenter  In 1994, Buckley, with his collaborator Frank Todaro, was offered the chance to direct a few unscripted, ultra low-budget promos for ESPN's hockey telecasts. Buckley had never been behind the camera before, and the job was not paid. Over its 25-year run, the campaign has featured appearances from several sports stars, including Kobe Bryant, Wayne Gretzky, David Ortiz, Lebron James, Mike Tyson, and Michael Phelps. ‚Äô‚ÄôSportsCenter‚Äô‚Äô was named the best commercial campaign of the 1990s by The One Club.  Hungry Man Productions  In 1997, Buckley co- founded Hungry Man Productions along with \\"This is SportsCenter\\" creator, Hank Perlman and long-time producer Steve Orent. The company quickly added several directors to its roster, such as Jim Jenkins, David Shane, Bennett Miller and Stacy Wall. Buckley's first major work came in 1999 with his first Super Bowl spot, a commercial for Monster.com called ‚ÄúWhen I Grow Up.‚Äù In the 30-second spot, kids answered the question ‚ÄúWhat do you want to be when you grow up?‚Äù with responses such as ‚ÄúI want to be a ‚Äòyes‚Äô man‚Äô and ‚ÄúI want to be forced into early retirement.‚Äù Initially, the ad was considered a disappointment, as viewers gave the commercial low marks in the USA Today Ad Meter, a consumer poll of the best and worst Super Bowl ads that has become an industry standard for measuring public reaction (and therefore success) of a multi-million dollar project. However,the Monster.com ad continued to get airplay over the next few days while conversation around other commercials died down, and the job site ended up crashing due to increased user activity. Monster.com reported an increase of 1 million site visits per month for the rest of 1999. By 2004, the company won the Cannes Festival's Palme d'Or as the top commercial production company in the world and has finished in the top ten for more than ten consecutive years, the first production company to do so. Hungry Man has offices in New York, Los Angeles, London, Rio and S√£o Paulo, and has a slate of directors including Taika Waititi, Wayne McClammy, and Nanette Burstein.  Commercial Work  Over the course of his career, Buckley has worked on several campaigns and commercial spots, including ‚ÄúWhat Happens in Vegas,‚Äù Verizon's first ever Spanish language campaign for the Oscars, and FedEx's ‚ÄúCastaway.‚Äù As his work has grown in scale, Buckley has collaborated with celebrities such as Larry David, Jennifer Anniston, Conan O‚ÄôBrien, Ellen DeGeneres, Leslie Mann, Taylor Swift, and The Rock, who starred in Apple's ‚ÄúThe Rock x Siri Dominate the Day‚Äù commercial, which racked up over 80 million views. His work has often garnered publicity, and has at times been described as \\"anticommercials\\". His commercial for E*Trade in 2000 featured a mock- amateur commercial. The setting: a disheveled two-car garage. A chimpanzee, wearing an oversize E*Trade T-shirt, is flanked by a pair of men. All face the camera. They clap, out of sync, to a tinny recording of La Cucaracha. At the end, the chimpanzee folds his hands over his crotch. A tag line appears: Well, we just wasted $2 million. What are you doing with your money?‚Äô‚Äô In 2018, Adweek would declare it ‚ÄúThe Most Subversive Super Bowl Ad Ever.‚Äù In 2011, Buckley directed a series of commercials for New Era apparel. The campaign, titled ‚ÄúRivalry,‚Äù saw actors John Krasinski and Alec Baldwin engaged in ongoing trash talk as fans of their respective teams, the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees. The spots were inducted into the Permanent Collection of the Museum of Modern Art. His 2020 Super Bowl spot for Hyundai, titled \\"Smaht Pahk,\\" was a massive success. It was named on several best of the game lists by Time, Adweek, and Vogue. It was also ranked No. 2 in the USA Today Ad Meter. The spot, which starred John Krasinski, Chris Evans, Rachel Dratch, and David Ortiz featured the Massachusetts natives over-enunciating the distinctive vowels of the classic Boston accent as they talked about Hyundai's new Sonata. Awards In 1999, Buckley won the Best Directing award from the DGA, a cumulative award for several commercials he directed that year, including his Super Bowl monster.com ‚ÄúWhen I Grow Up‚Äù spot, and work for E*trade. He has been won three Emmy Awards, and has won over 50 Cannes Lions, most recently the top honors at Cannes in 2019, a Grand Prix for his work on March for Our Lives ‚ÄúGeneration Lockdown‚Äù campaign to raise awareness about gun violence prevention. Buckley also took the Titanium Lion and the top honors, a Grand Clio for his Microsoft ‚ÄúChanging the Game‚Äù work showcasing Xbox's new adaptive controller, the first ever system designed to be inclusive of handicapped gamers. The same year, he won 15 gold pencils at the One Show for his work with both the Microsoft and March for our Lives campaigns. Buckley's two Academy Award nominations for Short Film within the same decade is the first time a director has managed to return to the category in over 30 years.  Narrative Work  In September 2011, Buckley shot the short film ASAD in South Africa in September 2011 with an all Somali refugee cast. The story, which Buckley also wrote, follows a young Somali boy's tale of how he deals with the decision to fall into a pirate life, or become an fisherman. The film screened at over 50 film festivals worldwide and took top honors at the Tribeca Film Festival, ultimately receiving a nomination for Best Live Action Short Film at the 85th Academy Awards. Buckley's first feature film, The Bronze, was selected to open the 2015 Sundance Film Festival and made a splash in Park City as the breakout comedy of the festival. In 2017, Buckley wrote and directed the American drama film The Pirates of Somalia. The film stars Evan Peters, Oscar Winner Al Pacino, Melanie Griffith, and Barkhad Abdi. The film, set in 2008, is about rookie Canadian journalist Jay Bahadur's plan to embed himself among the pirates of Somalia to provide the first close-up look at who these men are, how they live, and the forces that drive them. The film had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 27, 2017. The film was released on December 8, 2017, by Echo Bridge. The Hollywood Reporter called the film ‚ÄúA lively tale bent on deepening our understanding of its sensationalism-ready subject.‚Äù In 2019, Buckley wrote and directed the short film SARIA. The film explores the life of young female orphans at the Virgen de La Asuncion Safe Home in Guatemala, leading up to the fire which claimed 41 of their lives in 2017. The film was received well by critics, and Variety called the film \\"harrowing, but completely convincing in the way it presents the sexual and psychological abuse they endured... an influential chapter in a story that‚Äôs still being written.\\" Rather than using traditional child actors to play the roles of the orphans, Buckley opted to reach out to orphanages throughout Mexico to participate in the film. Ultimately, he established a partnership with Ministerios De Amor Orphanage in Mexico City. None of the girls had ever acted before they participated in the film. They received extensive training from an acting coach who would come to the orphanage daily. The production team bypassed the traditional festival circuit and four-walled the film for Academy Consideration just two days after completion, an unproven process that did not allow the traditional press cycle to build buzz around the film. However, the plan succeeded and the film received a nomination for Best Live Action Short Film at the 92nd Academy Awards.  Directing Style  His early work has been characterized as anarchic and populist. Defined by a ‚Äúrun and gun‚Äù style that often challenged the importance of advertising to begin with. \\"It ain't feel-good advertising,\\" Buckley acknowledges. Buckley's work has been primarily comedic. New York Times Magazine wrote ‚ÄúBryan is an interpreter of American fears. He doesn't make commercials; he writes haiku.‚Äù He has been celebrated for his casting ability, and in his skill for directing unprofessional actors, whom he often casts for a more raw performance. Bryan's later work has typically involved more prominent celebrity roles, driven by character-driven comedy. Though his body of work is primarily comedic, Buckley has shifted to a more socially- conscious approach in recent years.His narrative work has been defined by a focus on the oppressed and oppressors, and the need to illuminate otherwise unknown or under-reported injustices.  Activism  Buckley has been a long- time supporter of activism and philanthropy. In the past, he was worked with organizations like Women's March to create advocacy campaigns at no cost. Activist Estephany Raquel Arreaga Jimenez (from left) Congressmen Vicente Gonzalez and Adriano Espaillat with Bryan Buckley after their 2020 meeting. In 2019, Buckley directed work for the ‚ÄúGeneration Lockdown‚Äù campaign on behalf of March for our Lives, an organization dedicated to preventing gun violence in the USA. The commercial was created in support of the S.42 Background Check Expansion Act, and was cited by several members of Congress to advocate for stricter gun control. After the release of his 2019 short, SARIA, the film was cited by members of Congress in a 2020 letter to the Secretary of State. Congressmen Adriano Espaillat and Vicente Gonzalez stated the film \\"amplifies global awareness\\" of the issue, and demanded justice for the victims and an investigation into the whereabouts of the remaining survivors. Buckley has stayed involved with the pursuit of justice within Guatemala, attending a meeting on Capitol Hill between Stef Arreaga, a prominent activist and Congressmen Adriano Espaillat and Vicente Gonzalez Jr. Trump Statue Initiative In 2020, Buckley created a team named Trump Statue Initiative to mocking Donald Trump and actions taken during his presidency. Buckley noted \\"Trump is obsessed with statues\\".  King Of The Super Bowl  Buckley's work has consistently aired during the Super Bowl, leading to the New York Times deeming him the ‚ÄúKing of the Super Bowl‚Äù in, Buckley has directed over 60 commercials. His work is often rated at the top of every year's Super Bowl Commercial rankings. *SodaStream - \\"Water on Mars\\" (2020) *Hyundai - \\"Smaht Pahk\\" (2020) *Colgate - \\"Close Talker\\" (2019) *Microsoft - \\"We All Win\\" (2019) *Febreze - \\"Bleep Don't Stink\\" (2018) *Bud Light - Ghost Dog (2017) *He's a Ten - 4 Years of Hair (2017) *Honda - New Truck to Love (2016) *SodaStream - Sorry, Coke and Pepsi with Scarlett Johansson (2014) *TurboTax - Love Hurts (2014) *GoDaddy - \\"Body Builder\\" \\"Puppet Master\\" (2014) *Best Buy - Asking Amy (2013) *Tide (brand) - Miracle Stain (2013) *Coca-Cola - Mirage (2013) *CareerBuilder - Business Trip (2012) *Best Buy - Ozzy vs Bieber (2011) *Audi - Release the Hounds (2011) *Mini Cooper - Cram It in the Boot (2011) *Teleflora - Help Me Faith with Faith Hill (2011) *CareerBuilder - Parking Lot (2011) *McDonald's - Proud Papa (2011) *Audi - Green Police (2010) *HomeAway - Hotel Hell Vacation (2010) *Cash4Gold - One Up (2009) *Bud Light - Conan O'Brien (2009) *Sprint Nextel - Roadies (2009) *Planters - Perfume (2008) *Bud Light - Endorsement with Jackie Moon (2008) *CareerBuilder - \\"Darts\\" \\"Promotion Pit\\" \\"Performance Evaluation\\" (2007) *Chevy - Car Wash (2007) *Bud Light - Save Yourself (2006) *Sprint Nextel - \\"Crime Deterrent\\" \\"Couch\\" (2006) *Burger King - America's Favorite with The Whopperettes (2006) *CareerBuilder - \\"I Understand\\" \\"Celebration\\" (2006) *FedEx - Top Ten (2005) *GoDaddy.com - GoDaddy (2005) *MasterCard - Cashier (2005) *CareerBuilder - \\"Titanic\\" \\"Whoopi Cushion\\" \\"Monkey's Apology\\" (2005) *Chevy - Soap (2004) *Pepsi - The Osbournes (2003) *FedEx - Desert Island (2003) *H&R; Block - Willie (2003) *Visa - Bacon (2002) *E-Trade - Entertainer (2002) *Charles Schwab - HR King (2002) *E-Trade - \\"Security Guard\\" \\"Romantic Dinner\\" \\"Monkey II\\" (2001) *FedEx - Blow Up (2001) *E-Trade - \\"Monkey\\" \\"Basketball\\" \\"Out the Wazoo\\" \\"Window\\" (2000) *Monster.com - When I Grow Up (1999)Hungryman.com ReferencesExternal links * Category:1963 births Category:American film directors Category:American screenwriters Category:Living people ","title":"Bryan Buckley"},{"id":"26883242","text":"Rajadhani () is a 2011 Indian Kannada action crime film directed by debutante Sowmya Sathyan N.

Following a thirty-year joint reign of Brunswick-L√ºneburg with his brother Ernest the Confessor, he ruled the newly founded Duchy of Gifhorn from Gifhorn Castle for over 10 years from 1539 until his death in 1549. He was given the duchy as an inheritance settlement by his brother Ernest.  Life  Francis was born on 23 November 1508 in Uelzen. His father, Henry the Middle (1468‚Äì1532), had planned that Francis would later become the Bishop of Hildesheim, but that proved impossible due to the worsened political situation. After his father (who had supported a losing French contender for the imperial elections) was exiled to Paris in 1521, his two elder brothers, Otto and Ernest the Confessor, ruled the severely indebted Duchy of Celle. They arranged for their brother, Francis, who was too young to share power, to have a professional education and, at the age of 16, sent him to the University of Wittenberg. When he came of age in 1526, he spent another ten years at the court of the Electorate of Saxony. There he was impressed by the extravagant courtly life at the royal court with its feasting, hunting and travelling. Not until 1536 did he return to Celle at the prompting of his elder brother, Ernest, who had since espoused the Lutheran doctrine.  Duchy of Gifhorn  Protestant duke on entering the chapel at Gifhorn Castle On his return, Francis showed no interest in the royal responsibilities expected of him. Moreover, the relatively modest standard of living in the little Residenz at Celle was not to his liking. By way of settlement he insisted on his own dukedom and pressed for a division of the territory. His demand for the whole eastern half of the duchy was unacceptable, not least due to the serious debts owed by the state. As a result, in 1539 he was only given the √Ñmter of Gifhorn, Fallersleben and Isenhagen Abbey near Hankensb√ºttel. These estates eventually made up the new Duchy of Gifhorn, a state of only of minor importance in the empire. It was a small, easily managed lordship, in which Duke Francis could indulge his noble image of himself and attended to his princely representational duties unfettered. He had Gifhorn Castle expanded as his Residenz and led an ostentatious, courtly life. At the same time he built Fallersleben Castle as a rural aristocratic estate.  Reformation  Like his brother Ernest the Confessor, Duke Francis belonged to the alliance of Protestant princes, who petitioned the Imperial Diet in Speyer in 1529 at the so-called Protestation at Speyer. Both belonged to the Schmalkaldic League, which supported the ideas of Martin Luther. In building the castle chapel at Gifhorn Francis created the first religious building in Northwest Germany, that was specifically for Protestant church services. In 1546 Francis took part in the Schmalkaldic War; and in 1542, the Ottoman wars in Europe. In the area of Gifhorn he introduced the Reformation.  Marriage  Statue of wife Clara in the castle chapel at Gifhorn In 1547 Duke Francis married Clara of Saxe-Lauenburg, the daughter of Duke Magnus I of Saxe-Lauenburg in Ratzeburg. The marriage lasted only three years before the duke died in great pain on 23 November 1549 on his 41st birthday. The cause was an infection of his foot that did not heal and even an amputation could not save his life. He was interred in the chapel at Gifhorn Castle, where there is still a carved tomb figure on his sarcophagus. Because there were only 2 daughters from his marriage, the Duchy of Gifhorn returned to the family line in Celle. His wife, the Duchess Clara, was given Fallersleben Castle as her dowager home where she applied herself wholeheartedly to the common good of the place. She died in 1576 during a visit to Barth and was interred there.

Infections by Bertiella are known as bertielliasis. Occasional human infections have been documented by one of two species: Bertiella studeri, or Bertiella mucronata. Bertiella transmission is through oribatid mites that are present in the soil of problem areas, and can be easily prevented by avoiding contact with nonhuman primates, rodents and soil in these areas.  Pathology  Of 29 different Bertiella species, only two can infect humans: Bertiella studeri (majority of human cases), and Bertiella mucronata. Infected patients are usually asymptomatic. Often individuals will have no fever and show no signs of internal organ damage or distress. Although symptoms are unique to each individual, an infected human may suffer from gastrointestinal irritation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anorexia, weight loss, vomit and/or constipation.  Treatment  Albendazole is not effective in treating this condition; praziquantel is the preferred agent.

It is often prepared for celebration events and has a strong odor and flavor. Tocosh can be used as a natural antibiotic because penicillin is produced during the fermentation process. Medicinally it is used for the common cold, gastric ulcers, pneumonia, and altitude sickness among others. The Incas believed it was a gift from Inti for preservation of the body. The fermentation process of creating tocosh was discovered by the Incas (or possibly one of the many tribes in their empire). Fermentation is achieved by placing either potato pulp or maize in a mesh bag of grass, covered with stones, and left undisturbed for six to twelve months within a pool of water where there is a current (the pool usually found naturally or dug on the banks of a stream). The current flows through the stones to wash away bacteria during fermentation. Once fermentation has occurred, the tocosh is dried in the sun and stored for future use. The most common preparation in the Hu√°nuco region of Peru is to make a mazamorra or jelly-like dessert.

It is surrounded by a rectangular bailey measuring , with a hedge on its northern border. Location The ruins of castle are located along the A488 road, near Llangunllo in the northern direction of the Radnor Forest. Bleddfa means ‚Äúabode of the wolves‚Äù, as in the past, during the period of the Tudors, wolves inhabited the area. The last Welsh wolf is said to have been hunted down at Cregina, which is between Builth and Glascwm. History The first record of Bleddfa appears in 1195, when Hugh de Say received from King Richard I licence to fortify the castle and a square tower; Hugh had been killed in the battle of Radnor in later part of 1195 itself. In 1262 the castle was captured and razed by Llewelyn ap Gruffydd, who snatched it from the control of the Mortimers. In 1304, Edward I began using material from the castle to erect church tower nearby, which was itself destroyed by the Welsh in 1403. Features There is a moat of depth, which is mostly in a ruined state. The masonry remnant in the mound is believed to have been a square tower. It has an inscription dated 1195, recording a grant for its renovation.

In 1869 it was relocated to the downtown area, and was housed in various business buildings. The library moved throughout the 19th century and early twentieth century, residing in spaces above furniture stores and Odd Fellows Hall. In 1874, E.M. Griswold's store and Post Office hosted the library's collection and services. The Horicon Free Library Association formed in 1899, and in 1926, the Library was provided a municipally-funded space in City Hall located on West Lake Street. When a new City Hall was built in 1957, the library moved with it, and there it resides today. In 1993 the library was moved from an upstairs location to the newly renovated former fire department space adjoining City Hall. Public funding of the library has grown with the collection and needs of the community. $300 was appropriated from the city's coffers in 1900. This funding was nowhere near the quantity needed, and the schools, churches, city band, theatricals and individuals and community groups raised more funds. By 1948, the city provided $1,400 of the library's annual budget, and in 2008 the City of Horicon supplied $196,645 of the $423,896 budget. Fundraising is still necessary to allow for programs at the library, with events such as auctions, raffles, and other activities allowing for the continuing programming initiative.Horicon Library plans Chairity event http://www.wiscnews.com/bdc/news/local/article_06969543-565f-50aa-b9c9-49152ef696d5.html, Horicon Library to decorate tree with origami http://www.wiscnews.com/bdc/news/local/article_ca9ed34a-847d-5e98-ad3b-462469afa603.html The Friends of the Horicon Public Library were organized in 1987 specifically to raise money for programs and special items, and to provide volunteers for library events.HPL Friends http://www.horicon.lib.wi.us/Friends_HPL.html The small-town evaluation program \\"First Impressions,\\" a program for community assessment and improvement, in 2009, stated that the Horicon Public Library was ‚Äúoutstanding.‚ÄùTeams offer ways to make Horicon more attractive http://www.wiscnews.com/bdc/news/local/article_dd953e87-4e37-5e56-98b5-736fc2a325ea.html Mission The mission of the library was last revised in 2010 to read: \\"Our Mission: To enrich the lives of all our community members with free access to programs, materials and services that empower, educate and inspire.\\"Horicon Public Library http://www.horicon.lib.wi.us Events The Horicon Public Library has offered a myriad of programs for all ages, from paranormal research presentationsParanormal team coming to Horicon library http://www.wiscnews.com/bdc/news/local/article_b719e173-2258-5989-bbbe- bbd3cf67abf3.html and teen sleepovers,Sleepover funds Horicon library fun http://www.wiscnews.com/bdc/news/local/article_54cdfc86-dd75-53f5-8745-0cc691d705ac.html to knitting classesKnitters continue learning and teaching http://www.wiscnews.com/bdc/news/local/article_1abbb368-0e55-53e4-bd9b-ed8d3fb8e0de.html and coffee cupping programs by local roasters.Good to the last drop http://www.wiscnews.com/bdc/news/local/article_43d9a52e-8bb6-5433-a78d-a95db4a5d0a1.html More traditional programs such as storytimes, book discussions and summer reading programs are also regularly hosted by the library.Horicon Library has big plans http://www.wiscnews.com/bdc/news/local/article_4eee8cbb- da0f-51e3-9d04-9ef21307233d.html The Horicon Public Library hosted a program with famous librarian Nancy Pearl in 2005.

The 2011 census recorded 4,031 Belarus-born people resident in England, 102 in Wales, 211 in Scotland and 62 in Northern Ireland. Nowadays, organised community life exists only in London. Terminology Belarusians or Byelorussians have been researched, and written of academically and journalistically, as a distinct ethnic group within the United Kingdom. History Plaque in Saint Helier in memory of people of Belarus, who lost their lives in Jersey during the Second World War According to researcher Natallia Hardzijenka, the first significant wave of immigration from Belarus to the UK took place in late 19th and the beginning of 20th century. Another significant wave came after the Second World War. A large number of those were former Belarusian military personnel of the Polish Anders Army. According to estimates, ten to twelve thousands of Belarusians arrived to the UK in the aftermath of the war. A significant number of them later emigrated to other countries (mainly the US, Canada and Australia). Many of the Belarusians who resettled in Britain during this period were registered or counted as Polish people, despite being ethnic East Slavs. This was due to Belarus not yet being considered an independent nation, and therefore the Belarusian ethnic group was similarly disregarded in statistics. During the 1960s, Ceslaus Sipovich and Alexander Nadson became notable religious figures for Belarusians in London, and were involved with the Belarusian Memorial Chapel.

The Belarusian Catholic Mission was established in 1946. In addition to its religious work, it has contributed to various secular initiatives of the Belarusian community in the UK, including the Francis Skaryna Belarusian Library and Museum. The Mission built the church of St Cyril of Turau and All the Patron Saints of the Belarusian People - the first Belarusian Catholic church outside Belarus and the first wooden church in London since the Great Fire of 1666.

Carty Park, also known as Rubber Park, is located in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. This park honors John J. Carty (1909‚Äì1970), a native of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn who lived his life only five blocks away and dedicated himself to New York City government for 32 years. History Rubber Park was opened in 1964 and was one of the first parks in New York City to have rubber matting under the children's‚Äô equipment thus the name of Rubber Park. Rubber Park has been the home of numerous groups of kids and teens since its opening. John J. Carty Park, located between 94th and 101st Streets and Fort Hamilton Parkway, was named by Local Law in 1971. The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA) developed both the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge (1965) and this park concurrently thanks to a 1956 federal grant. The playground section of the park contains benches, a large comfort station, numerous game tables, two drinking fountains, and a flagpole with a yardarm on a monument base. Play areas consist of red, yellow, green, and white play equipment with safety surfacing, a spray shower, tot and regular swings, basketball and handball courts, and a large asphalt play area. The additional park area, which is surrounded by a variety of trees, has a multitude of benches as well as picnic tables, a bocce court, and ten tennis courts. The area provides recreational activities for all. Facilities The park covers over ten acres and has been home to dances, concerts, and picnics. The park is also the home of the Fort Hamilton Senior Center. With over 700 members, Fort Hamilton Senior Center serves as a lively gathering place for senior citizens throughout Brooklyn. The center has a card room, library, dance and recreation room, an arts and crafts room, and a computer room. Established in 1966 under the TBTA's neighborhood improvement plan, the center officially opened on January 20, 1967.

It was mined for sulfur metal deposits during the first half of the 20th century and was the final obstacle in the construction of a railroad line to Eureka, California in 1914. The name is applied to the range, the peak, a populated place and an abandoned railroad station, tunnel and bridge all but the first located within the S-bend of the Eel River which gave the peak its name. Geography Island Mountain is named peak in the Island Mountain range which covers an area from Mendocino County into Trinity County. The highest point of this range, and its official centroid, is a benchmark called \\"South Peak\\" on the unnamed tallest point which is in Mendocino County. Island Mountain in Trinity County was named by settlers in the 1850s because it is nearly isolated by water from two creeks and the Eel River. Due to the resistance of the rock to erosion, the Eel River makes an abrupt \\"S\\" curve around Island Mountain in its otherwise north-northwesterly flow between the California Coast Ranges. It was noted as \\"Island Peak\\" by John Rockwell of the Coast Survey in 1878. Railroad history The Island Mountain itself () was the final obstacle to completion of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad between San Francisco and Eureka. Railroad construction proceeded northerly down the west side of the Eel River canyon and bridged the river at the \\"S\\" curve to enter tunnel number 27 through the mountain. There was a golden spike ceremony downstream of the mountain at Cain Rock in 1914 to complete the railroad. The redwood framing of tunnel 27 burned on September 6, 1978, and a significant length of the tunnel collapsed. Tunnel rebuilding costing 3.8 million dollars was completed on December 7, 1979. Stop number 293, also named \\"Island Mountain\\" on the Northwestern Pacific Railroad was located along the tracks near the river where a railroad bridge crosses the Eel prior to the tracks entering the south end of Island Mountain tunnel at milepost 194.8. Mining history A volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit within Island Mountain was mined after rail service became available. Between 1915 and 1930, 4,100 tons of copper, 140,000 ounces of silver, and 8,600 ounces of gold were mined. Minerals identified within the ore body include chalcanthite, chalcopyrite, copiapite, goslarite, pyrite, and pyrrhotite. Volcanic rock was quarried from Island Mountain by Northwestern Pacific Railroad for heavy riprap used as far away as Humboldt Bay. Populated place Island Mountain is the name of a populated place located in Trinity County located at , above sea level. The first post office here was established in 1905 under the name \\"Island\\" until August 16, 1915 when it was renamed \\"Island Mountain.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Island Mountain from Western Mining History. *Images of the tunnel and bridge. * * Category:Mountains of Trinity County, California Category:Mountains of Mendocino County, California Category:History of Humboldt County, California Category:Mountains of Northern California ","title":"Island Mountain"},{"id":"26883616","text":"Tina Charles may refer to: * Tina Charles (singer) (born 1954), English singer * Tina Charles (basketball) (born 1988), American basketball player See also *Charles (surname) ","title":"Tina Charles"},{"id":"26883623","text":"X, The Life and Times of Malcolm X is an opera with music by Anthony Davis and libretto by Thulani Davis based on the life of the civil rights leader Malcolm X.

A microstrip line shielded by via fences on a printed circuit board A via fence, also called a picket fence, is a structure used in planar electronic circuit technologies to improve isolation between components which would otherwise be coupled by electromagnetic fields. It consists of a row of via holes which, if spaced close enough together, form a barrier to electromagnetic wave propagation of slab modes in the substrate. Additionally if radiation in the air above the board is also to be suppressed, then a strip pad with via fence allows a shielding can to be electrically attached to the top side, but electrically behave as if it continued through the PCB. Modern electronics have components and sub-units at high densities to achieve small size. Typically, many functions are integrated on to the same board or die. If these are not properly shielded from each other, many problems can result including poor frequency response, noise performance, and distortion. Via fences are used to shield microstrip and stripline transmission lines, guard edges of printed circuit boards, shield functional circuit units from each other, and to form the walls of waveguides integrated into a planar format. Via fences are cheap and easy to implement, but use up board space and are not as effective as solid metal walls. Purpose Planar technologies are used at microwave frequencies and make use of printed circuit tracks as transmission lines. As well as interconnections, these lines can be used to form components of functional units such as filters and couplers. Planar lines readily couple to each other when in close proximity, an effect called parasitic coupling. The coupling is due to fringing fields spreading from the edges of the line and intersecting adjacent lines or components. This is a desirable feature within the unit where it is made use of as part of the design. It is not desirable, however, that the fields couple to adjacent units. Modern electronic devices are usually required to be small. That, and the drive to keep down costs, leads to a high degree of integration and circuit units in less than desirable proximity. Via fences are one method that can be used to reduce parasitic coupling between such units.Bahl, pages 290-291 Amongst the many problems that can be caused by parasitic coupling are reducing bandwidth, degrading passband flatness, reducing amplifier output power, increasing reflections, worsening noise figure, causing amplifier instability, and providing undesirable feedback paths.Bahl, page 291 In stripline, via fences running parallel to the line on either side serve to tie together the groundplanes, so preventing the propagation of parallel-plate modes.Harper, page 3.21 A similar arrangement is used to suppress unwanted modes in metal- backed coplanar waveguide. Structure Figure 2. Diagram of a microstrip via fence A via fence consists of a row of via holes, that is, holes that pass through the substrate and are metallised on the inside to connect to pads on the top and bottom of the substrate. In a stripline format both the top and bottom of the dielectric sheet are covered with a metal ground plane so any via holes are automatically grounded at both ends. In other planar formats such as microstrip there is a ground plane only at the bottom of the substrate. In these formats it is the usual practice to connect the top pads of the via fence with a metal track (see figure 2). This still does not completely fence off the field as can be done in stripline. In stripline the field can only propagate between the ground planes, but in microstrip it is able to leak over the top of the via fence. Nevertheless, connecting the top pads improves isolation by . In some technologies it is more convenient to form the fence from conducting posts rather than vias.Harper, page 3.20 Figure 3. Casting providing the metal walls for placing over microstrip via fences Isolation can be further improved by placing a metal wall on top of the via fence. These walls commonly form part of the device enclosure. The large holes in the via fences seen in figures 1 and 5 are screw holes for clamping these walls in place. The wall casting belonging to this circuit is shown in figure 3.Ponchak et al., page 349 Figure 4. Via hole equivalent circuit The design of the fence needs to consider the size and spacing of the vias. Ideally, vias should act as short circuits, but they are not ideal and a via equivalent circuit can be modelled as a shunt inductance. Sometimes, a more complex model is required such as the equivalent circuit shown in figure 4. L1 is due to the inductance of the pads and C is the capacitance between them. R and L2 are, respectively, the resistance and inductance of the via hole metallisation. Resonances must be considered, in particular the parallel resonance of C and L2 will allow electromagnetic waves to pass at the resonant frequency. This resonance needs to be placed outside the operating frequencies of the equipment concerned. Spacing of the fences needs to be small in comparison to a wavelength (Œª) in the substrate dielectric so as to make the fence appear solid to impinging waves. If too large, waves will be able to pass through the gaps. A common rule of thumb is to make the spacing less than Œª/20 at the maximum operating frequency.Multiple sources: Applications Figure 5. Via fences shielding the edge of a printed circuit Via fences are used primarily at RF and microwave frequencies wherever planar formats are being applied. They are used in printed circuit technologies such as microstrip, ceramic technologies such as low temperature co-fired ceramic, monolithic microwave integrated circuits, and system-on-a-package technology.Bahl, pages 290, 291 They are especially important in isolating circuit units operating at different frequencies. Also called via stitching, via fences can be used around the edge of a printed circuit board, an example can be seen in figure 5. This may be done to prevent electromagnetic interference with other equipment, or even to block radiation re-entering from elsewhere on the same circuit.Archambeault, pages 215-216 Via fences are also used in post-wall waveguide, also known as laminated waveguide (LWG).Pao & Aguirre, page 585 In LWG, two parallel via fences form the sidewalls of a waveguide. Between them, and the upper and lower groundplanes of the substrate, is an electromagnetically isolated space. There is no electrical conductor within this space, but electromagnetic waves can exist within the enclosed dielectric material of the substrate and their direction of propagation is guided by the LWG. This technology is typically used at millimetre band frequencies and consequently dimensions are quite small. Furthermore, good isolation requires that the vias are closely spaced. Typically, isolation is required between guides, that is per fence. A typical W band () fence specification meeting this requirement in LWG is vias spaced between centres. This can be challenging to manufacture, and a higher density of vias is sometimes achieved by constructing the fence from two staggered rows of vias.Pao & Aguirre, pages 586-589 Advantages and disadvantages Via fences are cheap and convenient. When used on planar formats they require no additional processes to manufacture. On a printed circuit for instance, they are made in the same process that creates the track patterns. However, via fences are not able to approach the isolation achievable with unbroken metal walls.Archambeault, page 216 Via fences use up a lot of valuable substrate real estate and so will increase the overall size of the assembly. Via fences too close to the line being guarded can degrade the isolation otherwise achievable. In stripline, a rule of thumb is to place the fences at least four times the trace to groundplane distance away from the line being guarded.Joffe & Lock, page 838 ReferencesBibliography *Archambeault, Bruce, PCB Design for Real- World EMI Control, Springer, 2002 . *Bahl, Inder, Lumped Elements for RF and Microwave Circuits, Artech House, 2003 . *Harper, Charles A., High Performance Printed Circuit Boards, McGraw Hill Professional, 2000 . *Joffe, Elya B.; Lock, Kai-Song, Grounds for Grounding: A Circuit to System Handbook, John Wiley & Sons, 2010 . *Pao, Hseuh-Yuan; Aguirre, Jerry, \\"Phased array\\", in Duixian Liu; Pfeiffer, Ulrich; Grzyb, Janusz; Gaucher, Brian; Advanced Millimeter-wave Technologies: Antennas, Packaging and Circuits, John Wiley & Sons, 2009 . *Ponchak, G.E.; Tentzeris, E.M.; Papapolymerou, J., \\"Coupling between microstrip lines embedded in polyimide layers for 3D-MMICs on Si\\", IEE Proceedings - Microwaves, Antennas and Propagation, volume 150, issue 5, pages 344-350, October 2003.

Benzie County lies on the other side of Oviatt Road. Like many small \\"company towns\\", Jacktown sprang up along a railroad, known as the Empire and Southeastern Railroad, a logging railroad turned passenger railroad that connected Empire Junction with Manistee and Northeastern Railroad south in Benzie County. Today, it is no more than a clearing in the woods. All that is left of Jacktown is the old abandoned railroad grade and a few basements and foundations of houses and other buildings. One of several local legends speculates the town depopulated after local water wells abruptly dried up one summer, however, Jacktown most likely died when Empire and Southeast Railroad went out of existence in the 1920s. Many of the local elderly in the area still remember Jacktown and/or stories of it, however, most information been lost with time.

It is in the permanent collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The sitter Professor Leslie William Miller (August 5, 1848 ‚Äì March 7, 1931) was an artist, educator, and principal of the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art for forty years, 1880‚Äì1920. He was born in Brattleboro, Vermont, and studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. He graduated from the Massachusetts Normal Art School (now Massachusetts College of Art) in 1874, and worked as a portrait painter. He returned to MNAS to teach, and completed a second degree in 1880. The Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art (PMSIA) had been chartered in 1876, and was housed in Memorial Hall, the art gallery from the 1876 Centennial Exposition. The school began classes in Fall 1877, in a building at 312 North Broad Street,First and Second Reports of the Board of Trustees of the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, (Philadelphia, 1878). and soon expanded into the old Franklin Institute (now the Philadelphia History Museum), at 15 South 7th Street.Fifth Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, (Philadelphia, 1881), p. 12. Miller came to Philadelphia in Summer 1880 as PMSIA's first principal, at the same time that Eakins was teaching at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Miller registered for PAFA's life classes in February 1881.Siegl, p. 155. Colleagues in Philadelphia's artistic circles, Eakins and Miller became close friends. Miller was a member of the American Philosophical Society, the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, and was a founder of the Art Club of Philadelphia. As secretary of the Fairmount Park Art Association (1900‚Äì20), he was involved in public art decisions for the City, including the layout of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway and the design of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. He was an honorary member of Philadelphia's T-Square Club, and of the Philadelphia chapter of the American Institute of Architects. Description Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, Broad & Pine Sts., Philadelphia. This is now Hamilton Hall, University of the Arts. In 1892, the Pennsylvania Institution for the Deaf and Dumb (now Pennsylvania School for the Deaf) moved to a suburban campus in the Germantown section of Philadelphia. The following year, its vacant buildings at Broad & Pine Streets were bought by the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art's trustees, and renovated for the art school's needs. Former student Charles Sheeler recalled Eakins visiting PMSIA to work on the portrait (probably in late 1900): > \\"One day a stocky little man, gray-haired and gray-bearded, passed through > our workroom. His trousers were tucked into short leather boots and fitted > so snugly as to make the braces over his dark sweater superfluous. Neither > his appearance nor his manner offered a clew as to the reason for his visit. > A few days later he returned and passed to the life-class room, just beyond > where we were working. Knotholes in the board partition were used at > intervals and permitted us to satisfy our curiosity. The stocky little man > was beginning a portrait of the principal of the school, Leslie Miller, and > before long the plan of the picture was indicated. The subject was to be > portrayed standing easily with one hand in his trousers pocket and the other > holding a manuscript from which he raised his eyes as if to direct them > toward an audience. As the artist's work continued we witnessed the progress > of a perspective drawing which was made on paper and then transferred to the > canvas, to account for charts of ornament receding into the background-- > those charts which we knew only too well. This careful procedure led us to > the conclusion that the man, whoever he was, couldn't be a great artist, for > we had learned somewhere that great artists painted only by inspiration, a > process akin to magic. > Several months were thus consumed; then came the day, as we discovered > through the convenient knotholes, when another perspective drawing was made > and transferred to the canvas, on the floor and to one side. The letters > spelled Eakins. The name was not familiar to us.\\"Constance Rourke, Charles > Sheeler: Artist in the American Tradition (1938), pp. 14-15; quoted in > Goodrich, vol. 2, pp. 182-85. G-349A. Perspective drawing of Eakins's signature (1901), Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. Of the perspective drawings described by Sheeler, only one is known to survive, that of Eakins's signature. He signed the painting (in perspective) at Miller's feet. In the nearly life-sized, full-length portrait, Miller is depicted as if lecturing to a class. The painting's eye level is unusually high and the color range limited, leading the viewer to Miller's face. Its informality makes this a democratic formal portrait. Eakins exhibited Miller's portrait seven times. It was awarded the Thomas R. Proctor Prize at the National Academy of Design in 1905, and the second class medal at the Carnegie Institute in 1907.Siegl, p. 156. G-349. Sketch for Portrait of Leslie W. Miller (1901), Philadelphia Museum of Art. Miller later wrote of the painting: > \\"The primitive, even shabby frameThe frame was made by Eakins. represents > Eakins' taste rather than mine as do the old nondescript clothes in which > the subject is garbed which he begged me to rescue from the slop-chest and > put on for the occasion, and personally I should be very glad to have the > frame at least spruced up a bit. > Ever since I found out how much of a picture he was going to make of it, I > have been haunted by a mild regret that I didn't insist on his painting me, > --if he painted me at all,-- in habilments that would at least have been > more like those I would have worn when appearing in any such character as > that in which he has done me the honor to portray me, but, as is evident > throughout all his work, he had a passion for the ultra informal which > sometimes carried him so far as to lead him to prefer the unfit to the fit > if it were only old, and worn and familiar enough. > But all that is part of the Eakins hallmark and of course it cannot be > spared. He was one of the great ones and I value the picture very > highly.\\"Leslie Miller to Arthur E. Bye, 1923, Philadelphia Museum of Art > Archives; quoted in Siegl, p. 156. The Metropolitan Museum of Art hosted a memorial exhibition of Eakins's work in November 1917. In a letter to his students at the Art Students League of New York, artist and teacher Robert Henri wrote: > \\"Look, if you will, ... at the portrait of Miller for a man's feeling for a > man. This is what I call a beautiful portrait; not a pretty or a swagger > portrait, but an honest, respectful, appreciative man-to-man portrait. > Eakins's pictures and his sculptures are the recordings of a man who lived > and studied and loved with a strong heart.\\"Robert Henri, The Art Spirit > (Philadelphia: J.B.

Feeling that the needs of Asian American librarians were unrepresented and under served by the American Library Association, she co-founded the Asian American Librarian Caucus (AALC) in 1975. It was the first Asian-American library organization that served the pan Asian American librarian community.Yamashita, Kenneth A.(2000), Asian/Pacific American Librarians Association‚Äî A History of APALA and Its Founders, Library Trends 49 (1) 2000: Ethnic Diversity in Library and Information Science, pg. 91 It was a predecessor to the Asian/Pacific American Librarians Association. Early life During Suzuki's lifetime, the U.S. was in a state of crisis. Suzuki was born in Westboro, Ohio in 1943. She was born at a time when other Japanese were being placed in internment camps (Japanese American internment). When Suzuki was in high school and college in the 1960s, the civil rights movement was very alive with leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. protesting for equal rights in the South and Washington. Suzuki graduated from the University of Nebraska in 1968. In 1969, she received her MSLS degree from the University of Denver. After she graduated, she started to work for the Chicago Public Library where she stayed until retirement.Library Trends 49 (1) 2000, pg. 89. Probably being influenced by the events during her lifetime, Suzuki carried on the struggle for Asian Americans locally in Chicago and nationally, within the ALA. Activism Suzuki held a number of positions in the Asian-American library community and Asian American community at large: *Chicago Chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League, Board of Directors, 1973-1983.Library Trends 49 (1) 2000, pg. 90. *Chicago‚Äôs Japanese American Resource Center (JARC), Board Member and Founder,1974 and First Chair, 1975.Library Trends 49 (1) 2000, pg. 91. *Japanese American Youth Organization, Advisor.Library Trends 49 (1) 2000, pg. 91. *Asian American Librarian Caucus(AALC) (later known as the Asian American Librarians Association (AALA)), Co-Founder, 1975.Library Trends 49 (1) 2000, pg. 93. *AALA‚Äôs Constitution Revision Committee, Member, 1979-80.Library Trends 49 (1) 2000, pg. 94. *Asian/Pacific American Librarians Midwest Association (APALMA), Founder, 1981.Library Trends 49 (1) 2000, pg. 94. Writings Suzuki continued her activist activities even in her writing. In her library articles \\"Asian Americans and libraries,\\"Suzuki writes to possible Asian-American librarians considering careers in the library profession. She dispels the myth that Asian Americans have somehow \\"made it\\" when there exists a class ceiling preventing them from attaining positions of real power.Suzuki, J.,& Yamashita, K. A. (1977). Asian American Public Librarians. In E.J. Josey & K. E. Peeples Jr. (Eds.), Opportunities for Minorities in Librarianship, pg. 124-125. She states that Asian Americans should not feel the need to go into technical services and libraries with large Asian populations, where Asian Americans are typically found in the profession. She encourages Asian Americans to take administrative positions and feel comfortable work in areas where there are few or no Asians.Opportunities for Minorities in Librarianship, pg. 127-128. Regardless of where Asian Americans work, she hopes that Asian Americans will make sure that library collections reflect the fact that Asian Americans are part of the fabric of this country, from the building of the transcontinental to the internment of Japanese Americans.Opportunities for Minorities in Librarianship, pg. 128. Her writing suggests that the biggest resource that Asian Americans are adding to a library collection is their ethnic background.Opportunities for Minorities in Librarianship, pg. 129. In her article, \\"Asian Americans and Libraries,\\" Suzuki's audience is the American Library Association. Suzuki reports on the activities of Asian American libraries and librarians.Suzuki, J. (1976), Asian Americans and libraries, The ALA yearbook: A review of library events for 1975, pg. 88-89. Death and legacy Suzuki started to have serious health problems in the late 1970s. She retired from the Chicago Public Library in the 1980s and died from complications from lupus in 1987.Library Trends 49 (1) 2000, pg. 94. Not much has been recorded about Suzuki's life. The Suzuki family and the ALA headquarters have no records of her work. Much of what is known and written about her life is by written in an article by Kenneth Yamashita, who worked with Suzuki from 1975-1978 in the Chicago Public Library and stayed in contact with her until her death in 1987.Library Trends 49 (1) 2000, pg. 94-95. Had she lived longer, she would have seen the seeds of her activism bear fruit but also would have had more literature written by and about her.

Notable articles  Examples of highly cited articles (>200 times) published in the journal are: * This review examined mechanisms of action of the atypical antipsychotic medications, emphasizing features of their pharmacology relevant to their profile of adverse effects. * This was a critical review of nosological issues related to bipolar disorder. It also proposed diagnostic criteria for bipolar spectrum disorders, making a unique contribution to the latter topic. * This review, by one of the developers of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, examined literature concerned with alexithymia (an inability to identify and describe ones' emotions). The review summarized evidence that alexithymia reflects deficits in the cognitive processing and regulation of emotions. Implications for future research, and for psychotherapy, were identified. * This was a retrospective cohort study that evaluated mortality in a cohort with schizophrenia by linkage to a national mortality registry. A 20-fold increase in the risk of suicide was found, but elevated mortality due to other causes was also identified. Overall, the risk of mortality was doubled and it was estimated that life expectancy was diminished by approximately 20 years. * In this study, cholecystokinin-tetrapeptide (CCK-4) and placebo were administered to 11 panic disorder patients. CCK-4 (but not placebo) was found to induce panic attack identical to the spontaneous panic attacks that occur in people with panic disorder.

The two men had previously designed the first modern luxury resort in San Juan, the Caribe Hilton. Another part of the complex, the seashell-inspired building for the restaurant La Perla, was designed by architect Mario Salvadori.https://www.foodandwine.com/travel/san- juan-best-restaurants-guide The hotel's design incorporated tropical climate features such as cross-ventilation, natural illumination, open lobbies and seamless transitions between inside and outside spaces, with details supposedly relevant to Island traditions: an interior patio, blinds, a mirador encompassing both the sea and the city and the use of water throughout as a leitmotif. The protective concrete element in the fa√ßade, called brise-soleil in French or ‚Äúquiebrasol‚Äù in Spanish, is an architectural element used by famed architect Le Corbusier. The purpose of the ‚Äúquiebrasol‚Äù is to filter the sun's rays towards the interior corridors. In 1973, the La Concha Hotel was united with the adjacent Condado Beach Hotel into one hotel, known as the Hyatt Puerto Rico. In 1976, management of the complex was taken over by Hilton International and the resort was renamed the Condado Beach La Concha Convention Center, with a huge convention wing built between the two existing hotel structures to physically connect them. The complex was later taken over by Carnival Cruise Line and renamed The Condado Beach Trio, before the La Concha wing was closed in 1995, followed by the closure of the Condado Beach wing in 1997. The government-owned properties sat vacant for years, and were finally severed in 2004. The convention center that joined them was demolished to build a public park. The La Concha reopened in December 2007 after a $220 million renovation, managed by Renaissance Hotels as La Concha Renaissance San Juan Resort. In the summer of 2010, the hotel opened a $100 million addition called The Suites Tower which features an atrium style building with one and two bedroom suites, kitchens, architectural lighting, and amenities. The hotel's Casino del Mar is located on the street level of the new tower.

It was released on 7 June 2010 through Strike Force Entertainment, part of Cherry Red Records. Background Variet√© marks Almond's 30th year as a recording artist. It is his first album of original material in nine years. At the time of its release, Almond himself stated it would be his final album of original material as he had increasingly become more interested in recording pre-existing songs (as many of his covers albums have showcased), but this would prove to be untrue and he went on to record further original material afterwards. Much of it is self-produced and co-written with longtime collaborators Neal Whitmore and Martin Watkins. The album was released in a standard one-disc jewel case and a limited edition two-disc digipak in a slip- sleeve version, featuring seven bonus tracks on the second disc. Critical reception Variet√© received mixed reviews from critics. The Guardian described a \\"nostalgic mood\\" but saw the album as \\"furrows already ploughed\\". The Daily Telegraph wrote about Almond's lyrics, stating that \\"his lyrical pen remains hilariously barbed\\", and called the album \\"self-composed cabaret sleaze\\". The review in The Scotsman agreed that Almond is looking back with this album, returning \\"to old themes with alacrity\\", and summarised by calling Variet√© \\"mischievous, lightweight fun compared to Almond's darker, more tortured journeys into European chanson\\". Simon Price in his review from The Independent called the album \\"an autobiography and also a hymn to the underground\\" and stated that Almond \\"is determined to squeeze life for its every last drop\\". The AllMusic review praised the production as flowing \\"freely from spare, late-night-in-the-cocktail-lounge settings to big, bold, orchestral statements\\". It also had further commentary on the bonus tracks available with the limited edition version of the album, stating that the \\"more minimal, acoustic-based\\" songs shine \\"a brighter light on Almond's songwriting abilities\\".

History The first phase of the hospital was financed by from funds raised by the Noah's Ark Appeal, which had been founded in May 2000, together with some support from the Welsh Assembly Government. The appeal patrons included Dame Shirley Bassey, who was born in Cardiff, Charlotte Church and Catherine Zeta-Jones. The first phase, which was designed by Boyes Rees and built by Laing O'Rourke at a cost of ¬£10 million, was officially opened by Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas in June 2006. In November 2007 Edwina Hart AM, the Health Minister of Wales, announced that the Welsh Assembly Government would fund that part of the capital costs for the second phase of the hospital which was not already being financed by the three local health boards and Health Commission Wales. In June 2010 the playrooms at the hospital were restocked with new toys by city department store John Lewis after the South Wales Echo reported that the theft of toys threatened a playroom with closure. Zeta-Jones and Douglas returned to the hospital to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the launch of the fundraising campaign in July 2010. Zeta-Jones announced in November 2012 that the hospital would become known as the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital for Wales. The second phase of the hospital, which was designed by Boyes Rees and built by Interserve at a cost of ¬£64 million, was opened by First Minister Carwyn Jones in May 2015. New facilities included five operating theatres, the new paediatric intensive care unit, a new hydrotherapy pool, and an \\"open\\" MRI scanner. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, as well as doctors at the hospital, have described the new facilities as \\"world class\\". In 2017, a play garden also opened in the second phase building.

Maintaining that the naked body is still a controversial subject, he is most famous for his ten paneled wall sculpture The Great Wall of Vagina, comprising plaster casts taken from 400 volunteers' genitals. Often using the body as inspiration he works with both traditional and novel materials and processes, he explores the human condition and themes of religion, sexuality and death. Work The main body of McCartney's work has been three-dimensional, often experimental in approach and frequently sociopolitical. Lately he has turned to photographic collage, creating life size body portraits using his own experimental methods. McCartney won his second public award for his pedal-powered road car Car-Bon Miles at the UK‚Äôs first Art Car Parade.Morley, Jacqui. \\"Jamie's green machine\\", Blackpool Gazette, 8 October 2007 In 2008, McCartney, based at JAG Gallery, Brighton, auctioned off a sculpture of a death mask of his father's face as part of the Men Only exhibition which raised ¬£500 for prostate cancer charity Everyman. McCartney called the piece \\"After\\". He was quoted as saying,\\"I‚Äôd never done anything like this before, but I wanted to address how I was feeling after my father‚Äôs death and reflect it in my art\\".Chiles, Andy. \\"Artist sells cast of dead father's face for ¬£500\\", The Argus, 19 September 2008 The Great Wall of Vagina comprises 400 plaster casts of women‚Äôs genitals arranged in ten panels; the polyptych spans nine meters in length. According to McCartney, the idea was sparked by the trend for the \\"designer vagina\\", where women resort to cosmetic surgery for a certain look. It was exhibited in Berlin in September 2008, and the following month in Brighton.Addicott, Ruth. \\"Breaking the mould\\", The Argus, 20 October 2008 (See Vagina and vulva in art.) His collection \\"Skin Deep\\", first shown at The Hay Hill Gallery on London's Cork Street, focuses on notions of beauty and sexuality. His two photographic series \\"Physical Photography\\" and \\"The Sum of Our Parts\\", concentrate again on the human form, using a document scanner to create a body image in abstract form. The artist refers to this as Neo-Cubism. McCartney also creates more conceptual pieces. His Messages in Bottles relied on chance and the collaboration of strangers to bring to fruition. His experimental \\"Sculptography\\" collaboration with photographer, Miss Aniela, is a further example of his experimental work, as is his \\"Scanography\\" series. In addition he is frequently commissioned to create one-off designs of furniture etc. for business and private clients, with the help of a large team of student volunteers under his name. Public artworks *Farm Animals - Egham, UK, 1999. *Car-bon-miles, in the UK's first Art Car Parade, Manchester 2007http://www.artcarparade.co.uk/ Education and early career Jamie McCartney trained at Hartford Art School (USA), graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Art summa cum laude in 'Experimental Studio Art' in 1991. After graduation he returned to London where he worked for 4 years for antiques importer, David Wainwright, eventually becoming a buyer for him in India and Pakistan. McCartney then took an HND in model making at Barking College and worked for several London model making companies such as Complete Fabrication and Gavin Lyndsey. He then set up a model making partnership, Gordon & McCartney, specialising in architectural and exhibition models as well as TV props and provided the art department for TV series \\"Renford Rejects\\". They also worked on the development of many of the Millennium Dome zones, most significantly the Body Zone with designers HPICM and architects Branson Coates. In early 1999 he left the partnership to establish a forge in Hackney, London to fulfill a public art commission he had won (a series of abstract farm animal sculptures in steel for Egham town centre, in Surrey). Later that year he again became involved in the Body Zone, helping to sculpt the interiors to resemble oversized body parts. This led to his move into the film industry, working as a sculptor and prop maker. He was frequently employed by Special Effects UK and Asylum, working on films such as Black Hawk Down, Charlotte Gray and The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. He also worked directly on films such as Around the World in 80 Days, V for Vendetta and Casino Royale. His last film was Mein Fuhrer shot at Babelsberg studios in Berlin. McCartney has exhibited work in numerous solo and group shows. He is the founder and the owner of Brighton Body Casting, a commercial lifecasting studio. He is also the founder and chairman of The Sussex Artists Club.

The society has a mission statement which declares it is a nonprofit organization that promotes knowledge, development, application, and training in safety pharmacology‚Äîa distinct scientific discipline that integrates the best practices of pharmacology, physiology and toxicology. The objective of safety pharmacology studies is to further the discovery, development and safe use of biologically active chemical entities and large molecules by the identification, monitoring and characterization of potentially undesirable pharmacodynamic activities in nonclinical studies. The Safety Pharmacology Society also supports the human safety of drugs and biologicals by fostering scientific research, education, and dissemination of scientific information through meetings and other scientific interactions. The Safety Pharmacology Society was incorporated in 2000, at the time when the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use was issuing ICH S7A,ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human Use.

They are small and reddish brown with a white ventral side. Australian blennies inhabit the shallow marine waters of the tropics. They are often found along the Great Barrier Reef and Coral Sea of Australia. Taxonomy This species is believed to be most closely related to E. fourmanoiri. Similarities between these two species include \\"broad, darkly dusky bands and stripes\\" and \\"dark opercular margin[s]\\", which are not found in other members of the \\"Opsifrontalis Group\\".

Description Australian blennies are small fish, reaching lengths of only . The dorsal two-thirds of the body is reddish-brown, with white spots forming two rows. The ventral third is white in colour. A reddish-brown stripe with white edges passes from the rear end of the operculum (gill covering) through the eyes. The colour of the stripes can vary by specimen, between bright orange-red and pinkish brown. Towards the posterior end, colouration turns grey. The dorsal fin has twelve spines and 13‚Äì15 soft rays. The anal fin has two spines and 15‚Äì17 soft rays. The pectoral fin usually has 13 soft rays but can occasionally have 14. The tail (caudal) fin possesses 14 rays.

Education  His first degree was a B.Sc. in Mathematics from the University of Sussex. This was followed by a Masters in Economics from Brown University. He took his Ph.D. in Economics at the London School of Economics in 1973 (being awarded the Bowley Prize in 1975).  Shorrocks index  In 1978, he introduced a measure based on income Gini coefficients to estimate income mobility. This measure, generalized by Maasoumi and Zandvakili, is now generally referred to as Shorrocks index, sometimes as Shorrocks mobility index or Shorrocks rigidity index. It attempts to estimate whether the income inequality Gini coefficient is permanent or temporary, and to what extent a country or region enables economic mobility to its people so that they can move from one (e.g. bottom 20%) income quantile to another (e.g. middle 20%) over time. In other words, Shorrocks index compares inequality of short-term earnings such as annual income of households, to inequality of long-term earnings such as 5-year or 10-year total income for same households.

Berk oversaw the growth of the modest Schillinger House music school into the Berklee College of Music, the largest independent school of music in the world. Between founding Schillinger House in 1945 and his retirement from Berklee College of Music in 1978, his entrepreneurial and music-industry savvy enabled the school's curriculum to keep place with popular music trends, developments in electronic music, and advancements in recording technology. He highly valued the practical application of classroom instruction, yet he guided the development of the curriculum to enable the school to become an accredited, degree-granting institution.  Early life and career  Born and raised in Boston's West End, Berk began playing professionally as a pianist at the age of 13 in dance orchestras led by Ruby Newman, Meyer Davis, and Joe Rines.Hazell, Ed: Berklee: The First 50 Years, (Berklee Press, 1995) p. 4 He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a degree in architectural engineering in 1932.

Y. (2000). Boundaries. New York: Simon & Schuster, p. 10:24 The reading room was designed to be a flexible space, allowing for public readings or personal study areas, as needed. An 1860s refurbished barn and two corn cribs comprise the exterior skin of the building.http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/lin/ The rustic exterior, which evokes the \\"architectural vernacular of 19th-century East Tennessee, a plain language of silvery, time-worn siding, rough logs, and minimal geometries\\" is melded with modern Shaker-like simplicity on the interior.Kreyling, C. (2000). Lin Finds New Use for Old Barn at Langston Hughes Library. Architectural Record, 188(5), 48 Maya Lin pointed out that the function of the exterior and that of the interior were different and thus she \\"wanted to make a real cut between outside and inside‚Ä¶there didn't seem to be much point in preserving the rustic feel of the barn's interior\\".Kreyling, 2000. One of the most striking aspects of the design are the glass-encased corn cribs that act as a base for the cantelievered barn that sits atop them. Margaret Butler of Martella Associates states that the glass between the logs \\"glows like a Chinese lantern\\" at night. The architect The Library was designed by Maya Lin, most famous for her Vietnam Veteran's Memorial in Washington DC., and who also created the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, AL. Martella Associates, Knoxville, were the architect of record. Lin explains her vision: \\"The idea was to maintain the integrity and character of the old barn yet introduce a new inner layer‚Ä¶expressing the idea of a separate inner skin slipping inside the old barn\\".Lin, 2000, p. 10:24 \\"I'd never seen a shape like that before and wanted to save it‚Ä¶.once I realized that the book collection was small and the library would be used as an intimate gathering space, I came up with the concept of an elevated reading room\\". Building materials The exterior skin consists of a reclaimed barn and two corncribs, held together with glass and steel bars. \\"Crib walls are supported by threaded steel rod, expressing this new architectural element, instead of hiding it\\".Crosbie, M.J. (2003). Architecture for the Books. Victoria, Australia: The Images Publishing Group p. 220. The interior spaces use new materials: maple and particleboard, sisal mats and recycled soybean husk tabletops designed by Lin.Crosbie, 2003, p. 221; Lin, 2000, p. 10:29, The materials chosen were either recycled or \\"green\\".

Inexplicable, yet a Fact (Russian: –ù–µ–æ–±—ä—è—Å–Ω–∏–º–æ, –Ω–æ —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç, often abbreviated as –ù–ù–§ and has also been translated as Inexplicable, but Factual) was a popular TV show on TNT (Russian TV channel). Inexplicable, yet a Fact is among the earliest pseudo- documentary projects on the Russian television and has influenced several similar projects on other Russian TV channels: Fantastical Stories (REN TV), Cannot Be! (STS (TV channel)), X Files (DTV), and others. The series has begun shortly after Syfy's Ghost Hunters, possibly influenced by the success of the series, and before Discovery Channel's A Haunting. Inexplicable, yet a Fact, as well as the aforementioned pseudo-documentaries, root in Chariots of the Gods (film), with Inexplicable, yet a Fact heavily using the footage and ideas from the film in several episodes. Format=Video Videographically, the TV show features a roughly even blend of footage recorded originally and short sequences of shots from motion pictures. For this reason, Inexplicable, yet a Fact has featured an exceedingly rich array of films from experimental (notably, Jean-Pierre Jeunet's The Bunker of the Last Gunshots) to mainstream (notably, Bram Stoker's Dracula), with the heavier inclusion of the Qatsi trilogy, Mondo cane, and BBC documentaries (notably The Planets, The Human Body). Stills showcasing themes of narration (such as images of books, people, and phenomena mentioned) are also present. Audio Inexplicable, yet a Fact features a bed of a roughly even blend of popular music (notably, soundtracks to the Matrix trilogy and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, Depeche Mode's album Playing the Angel, Skunk Anansie's popular single Charlie Big Potato, and tracks from Caf√© del Mar's music compilations) and tracks from production music libraries: VideoHelper (heavy inclusion of tracks by Chris Jones, Serious Matters and Lo-Fi Groove, as well as Joseph Saba's and Stewart Winter's Enya's Head Trauma, notable for being remixed four times in VideoHelper's collections), Koka (notably, Jean Paul Niquin-Merkel's and Philippe Lhommet's track Millennium and the album KOK2095 Space), Omnimusic, Atmosphere, NYB, and others. Criticism The TV show has spread irrational, superstitious, and pseudoscientific belief in alien abductions, extrasensory perception, astrology, spiritism, numerology, palmistry, and related areas of human activity to the TNT viewers (mostly, the adolescent demographic). Comicality The active fan-community of the program exists on VK (social network), titled We are laughing at Inexplicable, yet a Fact (originally, –£–≥–∞—Ä–∞—é—â–∏–µ –ø–æ \\"–ù–µ–æ–±—ä—è—Å–Ω–∏–º–æ, –Ω–æ —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç\\"), which, together with TNT's mostly comic content (notably Comedy Club) and comic promotional videos, suggests that Inexplicable, yet a Fact is a parody of related television projects about mysticism, although the show presents itself in a grave, serious manner.

Mania Entertainment's Sakura Eries wrote that while the collection lacked \\"an overt theme,\\" the effect of a person on another is the focus of the six stories. IGN's A.E. Sparrow considered the theme of Beautiful People to be the meaning of beauty, and Mihara argues that beauty is found in one's character. Mikhail Koulikov of Anime News Network classified \\"Princess White Snow\\", \\"Blue Sky\\", and \\"beautiful people\\" as urban fantasy. Eries categorized \\"World's End\\" as post-apocalyptic fiction, while Koulikov considered it a modernized version of \\"Time Enough at Last\\", a Twilight Zone episode. Koulikov wrote that \\"Electric Angel\\" and \\"The Lady Stalker\\" examines a darker side of the Japanese society not typically presented in manga. Release Written and illustrated by Mitsukazu Mihara, the six short stories of Beautiful People were published in a tank≈çbon volume by Shodensha on October 20, 2001.

Koulikov described it as \\"one of the finest examples of literary manga currently available in English.\\" Sparrow wrote that some of the stories would have a lasting appeal, and ranked it 4th in the list of the top ten manga of 2006. Eries enjoyed the design of the English-language cover, and recommended that high school students read it.

Originally from the Azores, his professional career spanned such diverse fields as retail supermarkets, television and radio broadcasting, real estate management and maritime shipping. His philanthropic works contributed to healthcare improvements and programmes of spiritual enrichment in Bermuda. In recognition of his achievements, Perry was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 2007. He died on November 27, 2014, at age 92. Early life The eldest of eight children, Fernance Perry was born November 25, 1922, in Ponta Delgada, S√£o Miguel Island in the Azores. He emigrated to Bermuda in 1926 as a young child with his parents, Manuel and Emily. As a young man in his early twenties living in Bermuda, a British overseas territory, he served in the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps during World War II. Business career In 1950, Perry acquired a small ‚ÄúPiggly Wiggly‚Äù grocery store in downtown Hamilton, subsequently expanding his food marketing business during the 1960s-1970s to an island-wide chain of supermarkets. He eventually sold the retail chain of supermarkets called Piggly Wiggly in 1979, but retained the real estate. The new owners changed the chain's brand name to \\"MarketPlace\\", as it is now known. Once called the island nation's \\"supermarket king\\" by Bermuda's Royal Gazette newspaper, Perry was also active in broadcasting and real estate development. In 1994, he invested in a large Bermuda holding company, BDC, when it was experiencing cash flow problems. Two years later, in 1996, he was named BDC's chairman, but sold his shares the following year. He was majority shareholder and chairman of Bermuda Broadcasting, which owns Bermuda's two over-the-air television stations, ABC-affiliate ZFB (channel 7) and CBS-affiliate ZBM (channel 9), along with radio stations Power 95, FM 89, and FM 105. In 2008, in the wake of labour unrest and amidst a staff shake-up at the broadcasting company, Perry told the Royal Gazette, \\"I think that the future looks bright\\". The following year, a strike by 40 unionised employees in April, 2009, halted all programming at the company's radio and television stations for four days. Perry said that changes in work rules and staff pay were needed \\"to help a financially ailing company\\". The work stoppage was settled and normal operations resumed on April 21, after government mediation. At the time of his death, Perry was President and CEO of Mayfair Ltd., a holding company with offices in Hamilton, as well as vice chairman of Bermuda Container Line Limited, which operates container ship service to Bermuda from Port Elizabeth, New Jersey, and Fernandina Beach, Florida. He also was majority owner of Devonshire Properties Ltd., a real estate management firm. Perry served on the board of directors of BF&M; Limited, a Bermuda insurance company, from 1991 until his resignation in January, 2007. He also served on the board of trustees of Bermuda's Saltus Grammar School. Philanthropy Between 1989-1991, Perry was chairman of the Bermuda Hospitals Board, when $13.8 million in improvements were made to King Edward VII Memorial Hospital. The \\"Perry Ward\\" at the hospital was named in recognition of his contributions to Bermuda health care. A devoutly religious man, Perry was a long-time member of the Evangelical Church of Bermuda, a Protestant church founded by Portuguese immigrants in 1890. He developed a island he owned in the Great Sound as a Christian youth campground, naming it Grace Island. Equipped with a chapel and campsites, it is used by Word of Life youth groups and others. He was one of the founders of the old Willowbank Resort and Christian retreat in Bermuda, where such speakers as Woodrow Kroll of Back to the Bible conducted conferences, and was the defunct resort's Chairman of the Board of Trustees prior to its closing in 2011. Awards In the New Year Honours 2007, Perry was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for services to commerce and the community. Asked by a Royal Gazette reporter for his reaction upon learning he was awarded the MBE, Perry said, \\"All my friends will be happy to know that at least I have got something at my old age. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it but they say that when you don‚Äôt expect something then you get it.\\" He was subsequently congratulated by resolution of the Azores parliament in January, 2007, for having achieved the honour. Personal life and death Perry's first marriage was to Trina Rose and they had one son, Richard. Perry later married Janice Byrd (born 1952) and they had three children: Christopher (born 1980), Tiffany (born 1983), and Jonathan Michael (born 1985). Perry had four grandchildren as of 2010. In addition to his Bermuda residence in Pembroke Parish, he also had U.S. residences in Atlanta, Georgia, and Naples, Florida. Perry was a member of the Mid Ocean Club, the Royal Hamilton Amateur Dinghy Club, and the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club. He died in Atlanta at age 92 on November 27, 2014.

From the same year, he began to participate in art exhibitions. He painted landscapes, genre scenes, still lifes, gradually restoring lost during the war skills. Later his art has been shown on the solo exhibitions in Moscow (1983) and in Leningrad (1990). The art works of the 1960‚Äì1970s nominated Osipov as one of the leading Leningrad painters with deep and original manner. In 1983, with the support of E. E. Moiseenko, a large solo exhibition of Sergey Osipov's works was shown at the Central House of Artists in Moscow. Sergei Ivanovich Osipov died on October 12, 1985 in Leningrad at the seventieth year of life.  Creation  In the artistic fate of S. Osipov, which began from the work at diploma picture, which developed progressively, without visible zigzags and jumps, researchers distinguish several periods.  1945‚Äì1958  His own recognizable individual style Sergei Osipov acquired gradually. Every year trips from the late 1940s to Staraya Ladoga, Izborsk, Pskov, and Staritsa helped the artist to restore his creative skills and establish himself in a circle of preferred topics. In the middle of 1950s in technical terms he was a well established as a master. This is evidenced his works partly shown at major exhibitions: A BoySergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism.

In the future, Osipov will practically abandon the presence of figures of people in the landscapes and the detailed reproduction of panoramic architectural views. The just following to nature no longer satisfied the artist. He felt the need to move on. But how, in what way?

Trusting to his own imagination, striving to achieve harmony and enhance expressiveness, Osipov is now less follow the path of nature, but to constucte composition himself, inhabiting his paintings previously observed in life and nature. He boldly uses artistic generalization, sacrificing secondary details in order for more integrity of the image. One of the first works in which Osipov manages to most fully embody new ideas was the painting Little Houses at the Volga River–õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–∞—è —à–∫–æ–ª–∞ –∂–∏–≤–æ–ø–∏—Å–∏. –û—á–µ—Ä–∫–∏ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏. –°–ü–±, –ì–∞–ª–µ—Ä–µ—è –ê–†–ö–ê, 2019. –°.183.

The work of Osipov was inextricably linked with the theme of the Motherland ‚Äì the Tver land, its nature, ancient Russian cities, and the peasant way of life. Since the end of the 1940s, he will annually, and often several times a year, travel to Staraya Ladoga, Izborsk, Staritsa, Torzhok, Pskov, bringing from these trips numerous studies, sketches and paintings. Then work continued in his city art studio. And so, year after year for forty years. In according to opinion of Georgy F. Golenky, a Leningrad art critic and first researcher of creativity S. Osipov, new traveling enriched Osipov invaluable lessons of the ancient builders of temples and forts, whose hands, intuition, and artistic tastes had created a rare beauty. Only then did he realize that the ravines, hills, river beds, trees, houses must be depicted as structural elements of the environment as small elements of an overall coherent picture of the world, expressing its essential features. Only after this appeared in landscapes of Sergei Osipov soft Russian fruitiness, a clear rhythm, and unique proportionality, in which we accurately recognize the national character of the landscape. By simplifying and light deformation of objects, Sergei Osipov emphasizes their three-dimensional structure, and internal force, the stress with which they have been created nature or man. \\"We must remind the viewer about the latent energy which filled every thing, - said the artist. - For me just here is a real hidden source of poetry, rather than in stories about the activities or events.\\"–°–µ–º–µ–Ω–æ–≤ –ê. –ù., –û—Å–∏–ø–æ–≤ –°. –ò., –ì—É—â–∏–Ω –ö. –ê. –ö–∞—Ç–∞–ª–æ–≥ –≤—ã—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–π. –ê–≤—Ç–æ—Ä –≤—Å—Ç—É–ø. —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å–∏ –ì. –§. –ì–æ–ª–µ–Ω—å–∫–∏–π. –õ., –•—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫ –†–°–§–°–†, 1977.

Another notable feature of his art becomes more abstract forms and the entire composition of the painting, a marked tendency to generalize, allegory, the desire to get away from naturalism to the contemplative and philosophical depth. Other notable features of Osipov‚Äôs painting become more conventional of the form and the whole composition of the picture at whole, a marked desire for generalizations, allegory, a desire to get away from contemplative naturalism to philosophical depth and some symbolism, but not crossing the line beyond which painting breaks with the real world. The style of the work of this period resembles a light ‚Äúsemi-cubism‚Äù, the form is formed by planes and faces. The most common color is lilac, in lilac tones Osipov writes the sky, water, a neutral background, the wall of the house, surprisingly subtly conveying the mood of the landscape.  1970‚Äì1985  Cornflowers. 1976.Sergei V.

Traditional for Sergei Osipov theme of the spiritual sources, which has been sounded earlier in his still lifes, now was embodied with great power and artistic taste in Cornflowers (1976), Still Life with a White Pitcher (1972), 'Autumn Branch' (1974) ), Dandelions' (1985) and in some others works. Having escaped from some overload of details in composition, which was encountered in his earlier works, Osipov achieves in still life a great depth of image and associativity of hidden subtext. The works of Sergei Osipov added to the Leningrad painting of 1970s their special contribution, original and significant.–°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á –û—Å–∏–ø–æ–≤. –ñ–∏–≤–æ–ø–∏—Å—å. –†–∏—Å—É–Ω–æ–∫. –í—ã—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–π. –ö–∞—Ç–∞–ª–æ–≥. –õ.: –•—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫ –†–°–§–°–†, 1990. –°.5. In his paintings much comes from the art of ancient Russian masters: laconicism of the artistic language, conventionality of form and accuracy of composition, resourcefulness in details, integrity, and expressiveness of the image built on unpretentious peasant material. By opinion of Svetlana Makhlina, small landscapes of Sergei Osipov are endowed with extraordinary power of influence on the audience. And the point here is not only that the painter, using the image of nature in its many manifestations, creates landscapes that are consonant with the mental state of man. In all his works, the theme of the Motherland is revealed, sung by the artist with great filial love. And this is quite difficult, because raising a big topic and making it close and understandable in the landscape genre is very and very difficult.–ú–∞—Ö–ª–∏–Ω–∞ –°. –¢. –û—Å–∏–ø–æ–≤ –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á //–°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü—ã –ø–∞–º—è—Ç–∏. –°–ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—á–Ω–æ-–±–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫. 1941‚Äì1945. –•—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –°–∞–Ω–∫—Ç-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ (–õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ) –°–æ—é–∑–∞ —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ ‚Äî –≤–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–∞–Ω—ã –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–π –û—Ç–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã. –ö–Ω.2. –°–ü–±, –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–ª–∏—Å, 2014. –°.157. Through all creativity of Osipov, the thought of continuity, of spiritual and cultural inheritance passes. In his works, the national past is not inseparable from the present. With his works, the author, as it were, confirms the idea that the beauty created by the ancestors does not lose its significance over time. She retains the ability to beneficially influence people and should be included in the spiritual life of contemporaries. His style of this time similar of a light semi-Cubism. These paintings are nominated Osipov of the leading artists of the Leningrad school, who made his own contribution to its identity and significance.–°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á –û—Å–∏–ø–æ–≤. –ñ–∏–≤–æ–ø–∏—Å—å. –†–∏—Å—É–Ω–æ–∫. –í—ã—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–π. –ö–∞—Ç–∞–ª–æ–≥. –õ., –•—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫ –†–°–§–°–†, 1990.

In 2016, the Elena and Gennady Timchenko Charity Fund donated ten paintings by Sergei I. Osipov with characteristic views of ancient Russian cities and architectural monuments to the Yamalo-Nenets Museum and Exhibition Complex named after I. S. Shemanovsky (Salekhard). In 2017, painting Autumn Branch (1974) by Sergei Osipov appeared in the TV series CHANCE shot by 20 Century Fox Film Corporation based on the novel of the same name by American novelist Kem Nunn, commissioned by American video streaming service Hulu with popular English actor Hugh Laurie in the title role. In the final two episodes of the thriller (\\"A Madness of Two\\", and \\"Especially If You Run Away\\") written by Kem Nunn the painting Autumn Branch by Sergei Osipov is shown in the interior of the house of the protagonist Dr. Eldon Chance, played by Hugh Laurie. Against the background of the painting, which plays a plot- forming role in these scenes, key dramatic dialogues unfold with the participation of the main characters of the film.–ï. –õ–æ–≥–≤–∏–Ω–æ–≤–∞. –ó–∞–≥–∞–¥–∫–∏ ¬´–û—Å–µ–Ω–Ω–µ–π –≤–µ—Ç–∫–∏¬ª –≠–ª–¥–æ–Ω–∞ –®–∞–Ω—Å–∞.

The Security Council was concerned that suspicion and a lack of trust among the parties had contributed to the delay in implementing the United Nations plan for Western Sahara. For progress to be achieved, both parties would have to have a vision of the post- referendum period. The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had set targets on assessing the Settlement Plan, including the release of political prisoners, confinement of Polisario troops and the reduction of Moroccan troops in the territory. The resolution reiterated the commitment of the Council to hold a referendum for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. However, concern was expressed at the continued delays in implementing the plan for the referendum, as part of the overall Settlement Plan; all parties were urged not to impede the implementation of the Settlement Plan and requested the Secretary-General to persuade both Morocco and the Polisario Front to resume participation in its implementation. Boutros-Ghali was further requested by 10 September 1995 to report on progress in this area. It was expected that the referendum would take place in early 1996 with November 1995 as the beginning of the transitional period. Based on a further report from the Secretary-General, it would be decided whether to continue the mandate of MINURSO beyond 30 September 1995.

At the same time, streamlined procedures adopted by the Committee established in 724 (1991) were welcomed, concerning legitimate humanitarian assistance requests and transshipment on the Danube River. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the international sanctions placed on Serbia and Montenegro were suspended until 18 September 1995.

This format continued during World War I and World War II. Through time, the Standard reduced its size from broadsheet to tabloid, and it became more of a feature-oriented weekly emphasizing feature writing, recipes, fiction, cartoons and, increasingly, illustrations and photographs over news items. In 1925, Graham sold the paper, along with other media properties including the Montreal Star, to John Wilson McConnell. The Standard was available in Montreal as a free weekend supplement to the Montreal Star and nationally through subscription and newsstands and was a rival to the Toronto-based Star Weekly. In 1947, the Standard wooed away popular cartoonist Jimmy Frise from the Star Weekly but as the Star Weekly retained the rights to the name of Frise's popular Birdseye Center comic strip, the cartoon was renamed Juniper Junction.

History Inside St. Andrew's A Presbyterian congregation started meeting in the Blackrock Town Hall from 29 July 1894. It was 1895 when the parish of Blackrock Presbyterian Church was formed and plans were set forth to build a church.St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church Blackrock History The congregation decided to buy Albion House on Mount Merrion Avenue around November 1895 for ¬£750. They raised ¬£304 towards building and William Hewat, a local Blackrock member of the congregation, suggested the church be named St. Andrew's and later donated ¬£800 enabling the purchase of Albion House in March 1896. The architects Messrs, Murray and Forrester were commissioned and the builder Patrick Caufield of Booterstown was chosen. Patrick Caufield on the Directory of Irish Architects The foundation stone of the church was laid on 27 October 1898 and the church was opened with its first service on 5 February 1899. The building is designed in an octagonal shape fronted by a large tower containing the main entrance. The church organ was installed in 1912 with half of the money donated by Andrew Carnegie (a Scottish-American industrialist, businessman, entrepreneur and a major philanthropist). His conditions for donating the money were simple. Once the congregation had raised half of the ¬£900 required, he would donate the rest. Under the ministry of Rev. Desmond Black a new hall was built and opened on 5 December 1959 to a cost of ¬£15,000. The hall was opened by Mrs. Scott McLeod, the wife of the United States Ambassador to Ireland at the time, and dedicated by Rt. Rev.

It serves as the parent company for four core brands, and is a supplier to many major airlines. Its head office is in Glattbrugg, Switzerland, near Zurich Airport. History= Beginnings and initial expansion (1992 to 2002)  Gategroup has its roots in Swissair catering, from which now-subsidiary Gate Gourmet emerged in 1992. Through a series of mergers and acquisitions, Gategroup has grown into a multibillion-dollar operation. Acquisitions include Aero-Chef, SAS Service Partner, VARIG Kitchens, British Airways Kitchens and Iber-Swiss. The company was worth roughly 6 billion Swiss francs before the September 11 attacks and the bankruptcy of Swissair. The rise of oil prices and collapse in consumer travel damaged airlines and many of Gate Gourmet's main customers went bankrupt or narrowly avoided bankruptcy. The weakness of the airlines affected the industries that cater to or support it. This set the stage for Gate Gourmet requiring a restructuring effort, which soon burdened its employees. The company was then sold in 2002 to Texas Pacific Group for US$870 million.  Acquisitions (2007 to 2016)  GateSafe Security Car. On 1 March 2007, Texas Pacific Group sold its remaining shares in Gate Gourmet to Merrill Lynch. On September 27, 2007, Gate Gourmet acquired a UK-based group operating under the Fernley and International Aviation Services (IAS) brands. The acquired companies offer services including aircraft cabin cleaning, aircraft washing, de-icing and toilet and water servicing; security activities such as baggage screening and document verification; airport executive lounges; and passenger services such as wheelchair and unaccompanied minor assistance. Along with Fernley and IAS, the group also includes Specialist Airport Services, European Airport Services and Airfield Services Ltd. The companies operate primarily in the UK, including at London's Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton airports, as well as Manchester, Dublin, Cork, Shannon, Liverpool, East Midlands, Biggin Hill and Glasgow. European Airport Services also operates in Amsterdam; Brussels, and several other regional airports in France and the Netherlands. The new range of Gate Gourmet's aviation special services were renamed Gate Aviation Services. In May 2009 Gategroup was listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange under ticker GATE. In 2010 the company acquired Cara Airline Solutions, the catering business from Cara Operations, thus investing in airline catering services in Canada. In 2012 Gategroup expanded its presence in the Asia Pacific by acquiring Qantas' Q Catering operations in Sydney and Cairns. They later took on the business activities of Pacific Flight Catering in New Zealand. In February 2016 the acquisition of Swedish travel retail specialist Inflight Service Group (IFS) was completed. In March 2016 Gategroup acquired 75% of Cambodia Air Catering Services.  Developments from 2016 to the present  In April 2016, Chinese conglomerate HNA Group offered to buy Gategroup for 1.4 billion Swiss francs. In the beginning of July 2016, HNA Group declared they had bought 63.6 percent of the voting rights and shares in Gategroup. By October 2016, HNA Group had acquired 96.1 percent of the voting rights and applied for a delisting of the remaining shares in Gategroup. They also informed that they were seeking to acquire 98 percent in order to request for the cancellation of the remaining publicly held shares. In January 2017 Gategroup acquired control of Servair from Air France, adding a major presence in Africa. Gategroup was delisted from the SIX Swiss Exchange in April 2017. In February 2018 gategroup co-founded the Airline Catering Association (ACA), which is based in Brussels, Belgium. In July 2018, Temasek and RRJ joined HNA Group as investors in Gategroup. In April 2019, RRJ Capital completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares in gategroup from HNA Group. As a result, RRJ Capital became the sole shareholder and Temasek was invested in gategroup through a mandatory exchangeable bond. In September 2019, Temasek converted the mandatory exchangeable bond to acquire 50% stake in gategroup, making Temasek and RRJ co-shareholders. In December 2019, gategroup reached an agreement for a takeover of the European business of Deutsche Lufthansa AG subsidiary LSG Group, to include LSG's on-board operating business in Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Spain, as well as its global equipment business under the Spiriant brand, its European convenience food business, train catering, lounges and Lufthansa employee markets under the Ringeltaube brand. Gategroup will take on the catering contract with Lufthansa, including the airline's main hubs in Frankfurt and Munich. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2020. Company information Gategroup exhibit stand at Passenger Experience Week 2018 Gategroup is a multinational organization with operations on six continents. As of 2018, it had more than 43,000 employees working across more than 200 facilities in 60 countries. 2018 revenue was approximately 4.9 billion Swiss Francs. Gategroup has four core brands: deSter, Gate Gourmet, gateretail and Servair. Disputes and strike action A major dispute, reminiscent of the Grunwick dispute of the 1970s, ensued when it sacked 670 staff based at Heathrow Airport in August 2005; the staff were gathered in a car park and the announcement made by megaphone.Personnel Today , 31 August 2005 In sympathy with the sacked workers, British Airways staff at the airport walked out, and mass pickets of Gate Gourmet were organised by the Transport and General Workers' Union. The American head of Gate Gourmet at the time, Dave Siegel, blamed the industrial action on \\"the most irrational, irresponsible group\\" he had ever seen in organised labour. Several workers alleged that Gate Gourmet had engineered the dispute to employ non-union workers at lower wages and with worse conditions of employment. The company subsequently offered a redundancy package of more than twice the statutory minimum in an effort to resolve the labour difficulties, secure a new deal with British Airways, and avoid insolvency. The union later negotiated the reinstatement of some of the employees, but others have continued to protest at their treatment. In a separate 2005 incident, unions representing Gate Gourmet employees in the United States successfully sued the company after it tried to eliminate the employees' healthcare benefits.  Vehicle safety  In December 2018, a survey by the union of drivers for Gate Gourmet flagged concerns about the catering vehicles used to service planes. 97% of drivers reported that Gate Gourmet is continuing to use vehicles which are labeled \\"no go\\" due to issues like broken safety rails, missing emergency equipment or broken brakes. Drivers also reported that the vehicles are infested with rodents or insects. Food safety=IFSA Gate Gourmet is an active member of The International Food Services Association's Government Affairs and Education Committee, which issues the World Food Safety Guidelines for Airline Catering (WFSG). IFSA noted in the 2019 WFSG release: \\"Food safety has long been recognized by the airline catering industry as a matter of paramount importance and this is reflected in its ongoing commitment to the development of industry guidelines.\\" Global Food Safety Resource A case study titled \\"Gate Gourmet Ensures Quality Airline Catering\\" was published by Global Food Safety Resource, a source for best practices in food safety compliance. Contaminated carrots incident In August 2004, 45 people became ill with shigellosis after eating contaminated carrots provided by Gate Gourmet. After the outbreak, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected Gate Gourmet's Honolulu facility and determined that there were substantial problems. Gate Gourmet was warned that unless the problems were rectified, its facility would be shut down. FDA warns airline food supplier over filth Needles incident On July 16, 2012, sewing needles were discovered in four different turkey sandwiches on separate Delta Air Lines flights. Each sandwich was distributed by Gate Gourmet. The flights originated from Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, Netherlands, to several different U.S. cities, including Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Seattle. The needles were discovered by passengers, including a U.S. Federal Air Marshal. In response to the incident, Delta advised all of their flights leaving Schiphol Airport to stop serving the sandwiches, and an FBI investigation was launched to determine the cause. One passenger was injured, but declined medical attention.  Listeria scare  In November 2017, Listeria bacteria were found in Gate Gourmet's production facility in Los Angeles. Airlines including American, Delta and Virgin temporarily suspended their use of Gate Gourmet's services.  FDA inspection  In December 2017, the FDA inspected one of Gate Gourmet's facilities in Erlanger, Kentucky. The FDA found a number of health infractions, including \\"too numerous to count cockroaches\\", including live cockroaches in the ovens used to prepare food, as well as broken and filthy equipment. Pigeons were observed flying over the ovens, as well as eating out of them, and inspectors observed employees cleaning grills with only water and orange juice. In May 2018, the FDA reported that Gate Gourmet had addressed these concerns.

At the 1917 Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Menshevik), a party Central Committee consisting of Raphael Abramovich, I. Akhmatov, I. Astrov, Pavel Axelrod, B. Gurevich, E. Broido, F. Lipkin, Fyodor Dan, Henryk Ehrlich, V. Ezhov, K. G. Gogua, B. Gorev, Ivan Maisky, Julius Martov, Alexander Martinov, A. Frumson, Pinkevich, S. Semkovskii and I. Volkov was elected. After the October Revolution, differences emerged inside the party. In 1921, the party issued the \\"Platform of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party\\", calling for liquidating the political monopoly of the Communist Party, which was identified as something quite different from the dictatorship of the proletariat, privatizations of large sectors of industry and giving full voting rights to the peasantry and those treated by the Soviet government as the bourgeois class. From the beginning of 1921 after the suppression of the Kronstadt garrison revolt, the 10th Communist Party Congress and the introduction of the New Economic Policy (NEP) and ending of forcible confiscation of grain from the peasantry, the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was forced to operate underground in Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union and openly only in exile in Europe and North America. The Foreign Delegation of the party had been established in 1920 and was at first located in Berlin (until 1933), then shifted to Paris and in 1940 moved to New York City.Liebich, Andr√©: From the other shore: Russian social democracy after 1921. Cambridge, Massachusetts, London 1997. In exile, the party consisted of small groups in Geneva, Li√®ge, Berlin, Paris, Bern and New York City. Martov and Abramovich chaired the Foreign Delegation until 1923, when it was chaired by Fyodor Dan and Abramovich. Aron Jugov was the secretary of the Foreign Delegation. In 1921, the party formed part of the Vienna International, with Martov and Abramovich being two of the organizers. At the founding Congress of the Labour and Socialist International (LSI) in 1923, eleven Menshevik delegates participated. The party was a member of the LSI from 1923‚Äì1940. Abramovich represented the party in the LSI executive during this entire period, being a member of the LSI bureau until May 1939.Kowalski, Werner.

Free will in antiquity was not discussed in the same terms as used in the modern free will debates, but historians of the problem have speculated who exactly was first to take positions as determinist, libertarian, and compatibilist in antiquity.Susanne Bobzien, Determinism and Freedom in Stoic Philosophy; Timothy O'Keefe, Epicurus on Freedom, R. W. Sharples, Alexander of Aphrodisias On Fate , David Furley, Two Studies in the Greek Atomists, Richard Sorabji, \\"Necessity, Cause, and Blame \\" There is wide agreement that these views were essentially fully formed over 2000 years ago. Candidates for the first thinkers to form these views, as well as the idea of a non-physical \\"agent- causal\\" libertarianism, include Democritus (460‚Äì370), Aristotle (384‚Äì322), Epicurus (341‚Äì270), Chrysippus (280‚Äì207), and Carneades (214‚Äì129). Hellenistic philosophy=Pre-Socratics Early Hellenistic religious accounts of man's fate explored the degree of human freedom permitted by the gods. A strong fatalism is present in tales that foretell the future, based on the idea that the gods have foreknowledge of future events. Anxious not to annoy the gods, the myth-makers rarely challenged the idea that the gods' foreknowledge is compatible with human freedom. The Moirai (the Fates) were thought to determine every person's destiny at birth. The first thinkers to look for explanatory causes (·ºÄŒπœÑŒØŒ±) in natural phenomena (rather than gods controlling events) were the Pre-Socratic philosophers (physiologoi). The reasons or rules (ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøŒπ) behind the physical (œÜœçœÉŒπœÇ) world became the ideal \\"laws\\" governing material phenomena. Anaximander (610-546) coined the term physis (œÜœçœÉŒπœÇ) and perhaps even the cosmological combination of cosmos (Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒøœÇ), as organized nature, and logos (ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ), as the law behind nature. The Greeks had a separate word for the laws (or conventions) of society, nomos (ŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ). Heraclitus (535‚Äì475) claimed that everything changes (\\"you can't step twice into the same river\\"), but that there were laws or rules (the logos) behind all the change. The early cosmologists imagined that the universal laws were all-powerful and must therefore explain the natural causes behind all things, from the regular motions of the heavens to the mind (ŒΩŒø·ø¶œÇ) of man. These physiologoi transformed pre-philosophical arguments about gods controlling the human will into arguments about pre-existing causes controlling it. Democritus and Leucippus The materialist philosophers Democritus and his mentor Leucippus are considered to be the first determinists. They claimed that all things, including humans, were made of atoms in a void, with individual atomic motions strictly controlled by causal laws. Democritus said: > By convention (nomos) color, by convention sweet, by convention bitter, but > in reality atoms and a void.ŒΩœåŒº·ø≥ œáœÅŒøŒπŒÆ, ŒΩœåŒº·ø≥ Œ≥ŒªœÖŒ∫œç, ŒΩœåŒº·ø≥ œÄŒπŒ∫œÅœåŒΩ, ·ºëœÑŒµ·øá Œ¥‚Äô > ·ºÑœÑŒøŒºŒ± Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œ∫ŒµŒΩœåŒΩ Diels Kranz, fragment B125 Democritus's philosophy wrested control of man's fate from the gods, but ironically, he and Leucippus originated two of the great dogmas of determinism, physical determinism and logical necessity, which lead directly to the traditional and modern problem of free will and determinism.

Socrates In Plato's Gorgias (and in the Protagoras 345c4-e6), Socrates argues that no one does wrong willingly, one of the most famous doctrines to be associated with him. When framed in modern (Western) terms, the implication is that it is ignorance, rather that free individual agency, that is responsible for morally wrong actions. Aristotle Aristotle Michael Frede typifies the prevailing view of recent scholarship, namely that Aristotle did not have a notion of free-will. http://philpapers.org/archive/BOB_FW.pdf Aristotle elaborated the four possible causes (material, efficient, formal, and final). Aristotle's word for these causes was ·ºÄŒπœÑŒØŒ±, which translates as \\"causes\\" in the sense of the multiple factors responsible for an event. Aristotle did not subscribe to the simplistic \\"every event has a (single) cause\\" idea that was to come later. Then, in his Physics and Metaphysics, Aristotle also said there were \\"accidents\\" caused by \\"chance (œÑœÖœáŒÆ)\\". In his Physics, he noted that the early physicists had found no place for chance among their causes. Aristotle opposed his accidental chance to necessity: > Nor is there any definite cause for an accident, but only chance (œÑœÖœáœåŒΩ), > namely an indefinite (·ºÄœåœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøŒΩ) cause.Aristotle, Metaphysics, Book V, > 1025a25 > It is obvious that there are principles and causes which are generable and > destructible apart from the actual processes of generation and destruction; > for if this is not true, everything will be of necessity: that is, if there > must necessarily be some cause, other than accidental, of that which is > generated and destroyed. Will this be, or not? Yes, if this happens; > otherwise not.Aristotle, Metaphysics, Book VI, 1027a29 Tracing any particular sequence of events back in time will usually come to an accidental event ‚Äì a \\"starting point\\" or \\"fresh start\\" (Aristotle calls it an origin or arche (·ºÄœÅœáŒÆ) ‚Äì whose major contributing cause (or causes) was itself uncaused. Whether a particular thing happens, says Aristotle, may depend on a series of causes that > goes back to some starting-point, which does not go back to something else. > This, therefore, will be the starting-point of the fortuitous, and nothing > else is the cause of its generation.Aristotle, Metaphysics Book VI > 1027b12-14 In general, many such causal sequences contribute to any event, including human decisions. Each sequence has a different time of origin, some going back before we were born, some originating during our deliberations. Beyond causal sequences that are the result of chance or necessity, Aristotle felt that some breaks in the causal chain allow us to feel our actions \\"depend on us\\" (·ºêœÜ' ·º°Œº·øñŒΩ). These are the causal chains that originate within us (·ºêv ·º°Œº·øñŒΩ). Richard Sorabji's 1980 Necessity, Cause, and Blame surveyed Aristotle's positions on causation and necessity, comparing them to his predecessors and successors, especially the Stoics and Epicurus. Sorabji argues that Aristotle was an indeterminist, that real chance and uncaused events exist, but never that human actions are uncaused in the extreme libertarian sense that some commentators mistakenly attribute to Epicurus. > Aristotle accepted the past as fixed, in the sense that past events were > irrevocable. But future events cannot be necessitated by claims about the > present truth value of statements about the future. Aristotle does not deny > the excluded middle (either p or not p), only that the truth value of p does > not exist yet. Indeed, although the past is fixed, the truth value of past > statements about the future can be changed by the outcome of future events. > This is the problem of future contingents.Richard Sorabji, Necessity, Cause, > and Blame, p. ix Although he thinks Aristotle was not aware of the \\"problem\\" of free will vis- a-vis determinism (as first described by Epicurus), Sorabji thinks Aristotle's position on the question is clear enough. Voluntariness is too important to fall before theoretical arguments about necessity and determinism. > I come now to the question of how determinism is related to involuntariness. > Many commentators nowadays hold one or more parts of the following view. > Determinism creates a problem for belief in the voluntariness of actions. > Regrettably, but inevitably, Aristotle was unaware of this problem, and so > failed to cope with it.

In > Aristotle's time no one had yet propounded a universal determinism, so that > he knew of no such theory.

I shall argue that this account misrepresents the > situationRichard Sorabji, Necessity, Cause, and Blame, p. 243 Epicureanism Epicurus It is with Epicurus and the Stoics that clearly indeterministic and deterministic positions are first formulated. Writing one generation after Aristotle, Epicurus argued that as atoms moved through the void, there were occasions when they would \\"swerve\\" (clinamen) from their otherwise determined paths, thus initiating new causal chains. Epicurus argued that these swerves would allow us to be more responsible for our actions (libertarianism), something impossible if every action was deterministically caused. Epicurus did not say the swerve was directly involved in decisions. But following Aristotle, Epicurus thought human agents have the autonomous ability to transcend necessity and chance (both of which destroy responsibility), so that praise and blame are appropriate. Epicurus finds a tertium quid (a third option), beyond necessity (Democritus' physics) and beyond Aristotle's chance. His tertium quid is agent autonomy, what is \\"up to us\\". Here is the first explicit argument for libertarian free will. > ...some things happen of necessity (·ºÄŒΩŒ¨Œ≥Œ∫Œ∑), others by chance (œÑœçœáŒ∑), others > through our own agency (œÄŒ±œÅ‚Äô ·º°Œº·æ∂œÇ). > ...necessity destroys responsibility and chance is inconstant; whereas our > own actions are autonomous, and it is to them that praise and blame > naturally attach.Epicurus, Letter to Menoeceus, ¬ß133 Lucretius (1st century BCE), a strong supporter of Epicurus, saw the randomness as enabling free will, even if he could not explain exactly how, beyond the fact that random swerves would break the causal chain of determinism. > Again, if all motion is always one long chain, and new motion arises out of > the old in order invariable, and if the first-beginnings do not make by > swerving a beginning of motion such as to break the decrees of fate, that > cause may not follow cause from infinity, whence comes this freedom (libera) > in living creatures all over the earth, whence I say is this will (voluntas) > wrested from the fates by which we proceed whither pleasure leads each, > swerving also our motions not at fixed times and fixed places, but just > where our mind has taken us? For undoubtedly it is his own will in each that > begins these things, and from the will movements go rippling through the > limbs. In 1967, Pamela Huby suggested that Epicurus was the original discoverer of the \\"free-will problem\\". Huby noted that there had been two main free-will problems, corresponding to different determinisms, namely theological determinism (predestination and foreknowledge) and the physical causal determinism of Democritus. > It is unfortunate that our knowledge of the early history of the Stoics is > so fragmentary, and that we have no agreed account of the relations between > them and Epicurus. On the evidence we have, however, it seems to me more > probable that Epicurus was the originator of the freewill controversy, and > that it was only taken up with enthusiasm among the Stoics by Chrysippus, > the third head of the school.Pamela Huby, \\"The First Discovery of the > Freewill Problem\\", Philosophy, 42 (1967), p. 353 In 2000 Susanne Bobzien challenged Pamela Huby's 1967 assertion that Epicurus discovered the \\"free-will problem\\". > In 1967 Epicurus was credited with the discovery of the problem of free will > and determinism. Among the contestants were Aristotle and the early Stoics. > Epicurus emerged victorious, because ‚Äì so the argument went ‚Äì Aristotle did > not yet have the problem, and the Stoics inherited it from Epicurus. In the > same year David Furley published his essay 'Aristotle and Epicurus on > Voluntary Action', in which he argued that Epicurus' problem was not the > free will problem.

Bobzien thinks Epicurus did not have a model of what she calls \\"two-sided freedom,\\" because she believes that Epicurus > \\"assumed....a gap in the causal chain immediately before, or simultaneously > with, the decision or choice, a gap which allows the coming into being of a > spontaneous motion. In this way every human decision or choice is directly > linked with causal indeterminism....To avoid misunderstandings, I should > stress that I do believe that Epicurus was an indeterminist of sorts ‚Äì only > that he did not advocate indeterminist free decision or indeterminist free > choice. A. A. Long and D. N. Sedley, however, agree with Pamela Huby that Epicurus was the first to notice the modern problem of free will and determinism. > Epicurus' problem is this: if it has been necessary all along that we should > act as we do, it cannot be up to us, with the result that we would not be > morally responsible for our actions at all.

In her 1992 book, The Hellenistic Philosophy of Mind, Julia Annas wrote: > ...since swerves are random, it is hard to see how they help to explain free > action. We can scarcely expect there to be a random swerve before every free > action. Free actions are frequent, and (fairly) reliable. Random swerves > cannot account for either of these features.

Bailey imagined complexes of mind-atoms that work together to form a consciousness that is not determined, but also not susceptible to the pure randomness of individual atomic swerves, something that could constitute Epicurus' idea of actions being \\"up to us\\" (œÄ·Ω∞œÅ' ·º°ŒºŒ¨œÇ).It is a commonplace to state that Epicurus, like his follower Lucretius, intended primarily to combat the 'myths' of the orthodox religion, to show by his demonstration of the unfailing laws of nature the falseness of the old notions of the arbitrary action of the gods and so to relieve humanity from the terrors of superstition. But it is sometimes forgotten that Epicurus viewed with almost greater horror the conception of irresistible 'destiny' or 'necessity', which is the logical outcome of the notion of natural law pressed to its conclusion. This conclusion had been accepted in its fulness by Democritus, but Epicurus conspicuously broke away from him: 'it were better to follow the myths about the gods than to become a slave to the \\"destiny\\" of the natural philosophers: for the former suggests a hope of placating the gods by worship, whereas the latter involves a necessity which knows no placation'. ‚Äî Cyril Bailey, The Greek Atomists and Epicurus, p. 318 Bailey states that Epicurus did not identify freedom of the will with chance. > It may be that [Giussani's] account presses the Epicurean doctrine slightly > beyond the point to which the master had thought it out for himself, but it > is a direct deduction from undoubted Epicurean conceptions and is a > satisfactory explanation of what Epicurus meant: that he should have thought > that the freedom of the will was chance, and fought hard to maintain it as > chance and no more, is inconceivable.Cyril Bailey, The Greek Atomists and > Epicurus p. 437 In 1967 David Furley de-emphasized the importance of the swerve in both Epicurus and Lucretius so as to defend Epicurus from the \\"extreme\\" libertarian view that our actions are caused directly by random swerves. (Bailey had also denied this \\"traditional interpretation\\".) Furley argues for a strong connection between the ideas of Aristotle and Epicurus on autonomous actions that are \\"up to us\\". > If we now put together the introduction to Lucretius' passage on voluntas > and Aristotle's theory of the voluntary, we can see how the swerve of atoms > was supposed to do its work.

Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, saw that every event had a cause, and that cause necessitated the event. Given exactly the same circumstances, exactly the same result will occur. > It is impossible that the cause be present yet that of which it is the cause > not obtain.·ºÄŒ¥œçŒΩŒ±œÑŒøŒΩ Œ¥‚Äô Œµ·º¥ŒΩŒ±Œπ œÑ·Ω∏ Œº·Ω≤ŒΩ Œ±·º¥œÑŒπŒøŒΩ œÄŒ±œÅŒµ·øñŒΩŒ±Œπ, Œø·Ωñ Œ¥Œ≠ ·ºêœÉœÑŒπŒΩ Œ±·º¥œÑŒπŒøŒΩ Œº·Ω¥ > ·ΩëœÄŒ¨œÅœáŒµŒπŒΩ. Stoic philosopher Chrysippus The major developer of Stoicism, Chrysippus, took the edge off of strict necessity. Whereas the past is unchangeable, Chrysippus argued that some future events that are possible do not occur by necessity from past external factors alone, but might (as Aristotle and Epicurus maintained) depend on us. We have a choice to assent or not to assent to an action. Chrysippus said our actions are determined (in part by ourselves as causes) and fated (because of God's foreknowledge), but he also said that they are not necessitated, i.e., pre-determined from the distant past. Chrysippus would be seen today as a compatibilist. R. W. Sharples describes the first compatibilist arguments to reconcile responsibility and determinism by Chrysippus > The Stoic position, given definitive expression by Chrysippus (c. 280‚Äì207 > BC), the third head of the school, represents not the opposite extreme from > that of Epicurus but an attempt to compromise, to combine determinism and > responsibility. Their theory of the universe is indeed a completely > deterministic one; everything is governed by fate, identified with the > sequence of causes; nothing could happen otherwise than it does, and in any > given set of circumstances one and only one result can follow ‚Äì otherwise an > uncaused motion would occur. > Chrysippus was concerned to preserve human responsibility in the context of > his determinist system. His position was thus one of 'soft determinism', as > opposed on the one hand to that of the 'hard determinist' who claims that > determinism excludes responsibility, and on the other to that of the > libertarian who agrees on the incompatibility but responsibility by > determinism. The Greek to eph' hemin (·ºêœÜŒÑ ·º°Œº·øñŒΩ), 'what depends on us', like > the English 'responsibility', was used both by libertarians and by soft > determinists, though they differed as to what it involved; thus he > occurrence of the expression is not a safe guide to the type of position > involved. The situation is complicated by the fact that the debate is in > Greek philosophy conducted entirely in terms of responsibility (to eph' > hemin) rather than of freedom or free will; nevertheless it can be shown > that some thinkers, Alexander among them, have a libertarian rather than a > soft-determinist conception of responsibility, and in such cases I have not > hesitated to use expressions like 'freedom'.R. W. Sharples, Alexander of > Aphrodisias On Fate Alexander of Aphrodisias The Peripatetic philosopher Alexander of Aphrodisias (c. 150‚Äì210), the most famous of the ancient commentators on Aristotle, defended a view of moral responsibility we would call libertarianism today. Greek philosophy had no precise term for \\"free will\\" as did Latin (liberum arbitrium or libera voluntas). The discussion was in terms of responsibility, what \\"depends on us\\" (in Greek ·ºêœÜ ·º°Œº·øñŒΩ). Alexander believed that Aristotle was not a strict determinist like the Stoics, and Alexander argued that some events do not have pre-determined causes. In particular, man is responsible for self-caused decisions, and can choose to do or not to do something, as Chrysippus argued. However, Alexander denied the foreknowledge of events that was part of the Stoic identification of God and Nature. R. W. Sharples described Alexander's De Fato as perhaps the most comprehensive treatment surviving from classical antiquity of the problem of responsibility (œÑ·Ω∏ ·ºêœÜ‚Äô ·º°ŒºŒØŒΩ) and determinism. It especially shed a great deal of light on Aristotle's position on free will and on the Stoic attempt to make responsibility compatible with determinism.R. W. Sharples, translation and commentary Alexander of Aphrodisias On Fate (1983) Ancient Abrahamic religion=Ancient Judaism The ancient Hebrews distinguished between voluntary (willful) choices and actions, versus compelled actions, but the Hebrew scriptures are permeated with the notion that the will is always bound to the heart, and determined by the condition of one's heart. For the Ancient Hebrews, the \\"heart\\" (levav) is the \\"seat of volition,\\"Levav the locus of a person's desires, preferences, proclivities, inclinations, and motives. Humans will and choose, and do so voluntarily, but they do what they do according to the status of their hearts, which determines their desires, preferences, proclivities, inclinations, and motives.Exodus 25:2, Jeremiah 24:7, Proverbs 4:23, I Samuel 10:9, Exodus 4:21, Joshua 11:20. For the will to be changed, according to Ezekiel, God must first change the heart (Ezekiel 36:26-27) The way the heart compels the will is exemplified in the book of Exodus (among others), referring to gifts and offerings: > Exodus 35:21 Every man and woman whom their heart hath made willing to bring > in for all the work which Jehovah commanded to be done by the hand of Moses > of the sons of Israel brought in a willing-offering to Jehovah. The words above, \\"willing offering,\\" is the single Hebrew word nedabah. It was translated in 1611 by King James' bible translators \\"freewill offering.\\" The Hebrew nedabah ‚Äúfreewill offering‚Äù was ‚Äúfree‚Äù only insofar as it was free from compulsion by the legal requirement; free only applies to the nature of the offering in the legal sense. But the word ‚Äúfree‚Äù is not part of the word ‚Äúnedabah.‚Äù In fact, the meaning of nadab is to be compelled/incited/impelled by one‚Äôs heart.Nadab The will or choice is moved by the condition of the heart. It is willing, it happens voluntarily, because the heart impels it so. The adjective \\"freewill\\" set this kind of offering apart from other offerings (nederim) that were required by law and not, therefore, given by freewill. The word \\"freewill\\" in this context is not, therefore, referring to the metaphysical powers of the soul, but rather simply distinguishing voluntary offerings from compulsory offerings.Meaning of NedabahVarious Vows This is not what philosophers today refer to as libertarian free will. Isaiah the prophet painted a picture of God as a grand potter, with humans as passive clay in His hands. Isaiah said that man should not question the fact that God sovereignly controls him like passive inanimate dirt (Isaiah 29:16, 45:9). A central theme of Judaism to this day is that the Jews are God‚Äôs ‚Äúchosen‚Äù people, not because of they freely chose God, but because of God's oath to Abraham (See Deuteronomy 9:5-6). Christianity Insofar as Jesus and his disciples were Hebrew in their orientation, they embraced the notions of the heart articulated in the Hebrew Bible (see above). Hence, Jesus was reported to have said, > \\"A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and > an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For > the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.\\" (Luke 6:45) Cambridge Professor, Dr. McGrath, writes, ‚ÄúThe term ‚Äòfree will‚Äô is not biblical, but derives from Stoicism. It was introduced into Western Christianity by the second-century theologian Tertullian.‚ÄùAlister McGrath, Christian Theology, p. 351. The term \\"free will\\" is entirely absent from scholarly translations of the New Testament. On the other hand, the Greek word for \\"predestination\\" (proorizo) appears in several of Paul's letters. The ninth chapter of the letter to the Romans is often cited as the most specific Christian treatment of the nature of the will in Christianity. Later Christian interpreters, such as Pelagius, argued that the New Testament implicitly teaches a libertarian free will. Pelagius' views were deemed heresy by Augustine and early church councils. Though he started out arguing for free will, Augustine eventually concluded that the concept is not biblical. > \\"I once laboured hard for the free will of man, until the grace of God at > length overcame me.\\" (Augustine, Retractio 2.1) The leaders of the Protestant Reformation largely echoed Augustine's later views on free will, while Tridentine Catholicism, the Arminian Remonstrants, and Wesleyan (Methodism) leaned towards a version of Pelagius' doctrines.

The resolution was passed during the Srebrenica massacre. After reaffirming the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Security Council expressed deep concern at the situation in Srebrenica and for the civilian population there. The situation proved challenging for UNPROFOR, particularly as there were many displaced persons at Potoƒçari without essential humanitarian supplies. The detention of UNPROFOR personnel and attacks on the peacekeeping force by Bosnian Serb forces were condemned. The Council demanded that Bosnian Serb forces cease their offensive and withdraw from Srebrenica immediately, adding that the forces should respect its status as a safe area. It also demanded that the safety of UNPROFOR personnel was ensured and for the release of some of its members under detention. This was addressed again in Resolution 1010. All parties were called upon to allow access to the area for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and international humanitarian agencies in order to aid the civilian population and restore utilities. The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was requested to use all resources available to restore the \\"safe area\\" status of Srebrenica.

Buchholz Konikow (November 1869 ‚Äì 2 July 1946) was an American physician, Marxist, and radical political activist. Konikow is best remembered as one of the pioneers of the American birth control movement and as a founding member of the Communist Party of America, forerunner of the Communist Party, USA. Expelled from the Communist Party as a supporter of Leon Trotsky in the fall of 1928, Konikow went on to become a founder of the Communist League of America, the main Trotskyist organization in the United States. Konikow's 1923 book, Voluntary Motherhood, is regarded as a seminal work in the history of 20th Century American feminism. Biography=Early years Antoinette F. Buchholz was born on November 11, 1869, in the Russian empire, the daughter of Theodor Buchholz and Rosa Kuhner Buchholz, both of whom were ethnic Jews.John William Leonard (ed.), Woman's Who's Who of America, 1914-1915: A Biographical Dictionary of Contemporary Women of the United States and Canada. New York: American Commonwealth Co., 1914. She attended secondary school in Odessa in the Ukraine before emigrating to Zurich, Switzerland to attend the university there. She married a fellow student, Moses J. Konikow (pronounced KO-ni-koff), in Zurich in 1891.\\"Socialists Would Separate: Dr. Antoinette Konikow of Boston has Left Her Doctor Husband,\\" New York Times, August 16, 1908, pg. 8. While in Switzerland, Konikow joined the Emancipation of Labor group headed by Georgii Plekhanov.Constance Ashton Myers, The Prophet's Army: Trotskyists in America, 1928-1941 Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1977; pg. 34. The Konikows subsequently came to America in 1893.Myers, The Prophet's Army, pp. 34-35. Antoinette attended Tufts University, near Boston, from which she graduated with honors in 1902 with a medical degree. The couple had two children, Edith Rose Konikow (b. 1904) and William Morris Konikow (b. 1906) before divorcing in 1908. She remained a practicing medical doctor in Boston up through the 1930s. Political career Antoinette Konikow was politically active from an early age, joining the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP) in 1893 and writing and speaking on the organization's behalf. She was a delegate to the organization's 1896 National Convention at which it determined to establish the dual union to the American Federation of Labor, the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance.Diane Feeley, \\"Antoinette Bucholz Konikow,\\" in Mari Jo Buhle, Paul Buhle, and Dan Georgakas (eds.), Encyclopedia of the American Left. First Edition. New York: Garland Publishers, 1990; pg. 405. Konikow also worked closely with the Boston Workman's Circle (Yiddish: ◊ê÷∑◊®◊ë◊¢◊ò◊¢◊®÷æ◊®◊ô◊†◊í, Arbeter Ring), a socialist Jewish social aid organization.Mari Jo Buhle, Women and American Socialism, 1870-1920. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1981; pg. 270. In order to participate in the organization, Konikow learned Yiddish, one of five languages which she learned in her lifetime. She left the SLP in 1897 over what she believed to be the narrow and dogmatic policies of the organization.Priscilla Murolo, \\"Antoinette Konikow,\\" in Judy Barrett Litoff and Judith McDonnell (eds.), European Immigrant Women in the United States: A Biographical Dictionary. New York: Garland Publishing, 1994; pp. 167-168. Murolo incorrectly has the date of Konikow's expulsion as 1897. For the correct date, see: \\"Bravo! New Bedford, Mass., Big Socialist Labor Party Vote: Massachusetts and Pennsylvania State Conventions,\\" The People [New York], vol. 8, no. 10 (June 5, 1898), pg. 1, columns 2-3. Instead, Konikow cast her lot with the Social Democracy of America headed by Eugene V. Debs and Victor L. Berger, going so far as to sign a petition to the Massachusetts SLP convention inviting it to merge with the fledgling Chicago group.\\"Bravo! New Bedford, Mass., Big Socialist Labor Party Vote: Massachusetts and Pennsylvania State Conventions,\\" The People [New York], vol. 8, no. 10 (June 5, 1898), pg. 1. For her trouble the May 1898 Massachusetts State Convention of the SLP saw fit to formally expel Konikow from the organization. Konikow followed Debs and Berger in an 1898 split which established the Social Democratic Party of America and in 1901 became a founding member the Socialist Party of America (SPA) when that organization was created through a merger of the Social Democratic Party and an Eastern organization by the same name composed of former SLP dissidents. Konikow was a delegate to the SPA's 1908 National Convention,\\"Delegates to the 1908 Convention of the Socialist Party of America.\\" Early American Marxism website. Corvallis, OR. Retrieved April 8, 2010. and was later instrumental in the establishment of several Socialist Sunday Schools, institutions designed to train working class children in socialist principles and ethics as an alternative to religious instruction. When the Socialist Party split at its 1919 Emergency National Convention, Konikow cast her lot with the Communist Party of America (CPA), in which the radical foreign language federations of the old SP played a large role. Konikow participated as a delegate to the founding convention of the CPA in Chicago in September 1919. Konikow was also active in the Communist Party's \\"aboveground\\" activities in this period, serving as chair of the New England Division of the National Defense Committee, a party organization dedicated to raising funds to pay for its legal defense needs. Konikow was a delegate to the second convention of the Workers Party of America, successor to the underground Communist Party of America, held in New York City from December 24 to 26, 1922.\\"Delegates to the 1922 Convention of the Workers Party of America,\\" Early American Marxism website, Corvallis, OR. Retrieved April 8, 2010.

Retrieved April 8, 2010. Konikow was also deeply committed to the cause of birth control, a taboo topic in this era. She was a member of the Society of Sanitary and Moral Prophylaxis, one of the leading birth control organizations of the day. In the mid-1920s, she and her son-in- law, Joseph Vanzler (a.k.a. John G. Wright), jointly developed an inexpensive spermicidal jelly, the formula of which she shared with officials in the Soviet Union when she visited there as a birth control specialist in 1926. While in the USSR, Konikow was won over to the political ideas of Leon Trotsky, then embroiled in a bitter factional dispute with the leadership of the Russian Communist Party headed by Joseph Stalin and Nikolai Bukharin. From 1927, Konikow was open in her support with the program of the United Opposition of Trotsky with Grigorii Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev in the USSR.Emily Turnbull and James Robertson, \\"Introduction,\\" to James P. Cannon and the Early Years of American Communism: Selected Writings and Speeches, 1920-1928. New York: Prometheus Research Library, 1992; pg. 53-54. This did not lead to her immediate removal from the party, however, only to the loss of her position as an instructor in the local party training school. Konikow was expelled from the Communist Party headed by Executive Secretary Jay Lovestone in November 1928 as a Trotskyist. Upon her expulsion, she formed a tiny group in Boston calling itself the Independent Communist League. This group later merged with the Communist League of America headed by James P. Cannon, Martin Abern, and Max Shachtman at the time of its formation later that same year.Keith Anwar, \\"Antoinette Konikow,\\" in James P. Cannon and the Early Years of American Communism: Selected Writings and Speeches, 1920-1928. New York: Prometheus Research Library, 1992; pg. 586. She remained active in this movement until her death, contributing frequently to the party press on women's issues. At the convention establishing the Socialist Workers Party in January 1938, Konikow was named an honorary member of its governing National Committee. Death and legacy Antoinette Konikow died of a heart attack in Boston in July 1946. Konikow's 1923 book, Voluntary Motherhood, is regarded as a seminal work in the history of 20th century American feminism.

Zabriskie Farmhouse is located at the current address of 7 East Ridgewood Avenue in Paramus, Bergen County, New Jersey, United States, just east of New Jersey Route 17. This is one of several Zabriskie historic sites associated with the descendants of prominent settler Albrycht Zaborowski (1638‚Äì1711). This stone house was built in 1805 by Albert Jacob Zabriskie (1760‚Äì1835) in the New Jersey Dutch style, owned by four generations of the family until 1924, and added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 7, 1977. Due to confusion from the street name and handwritten notes on one page of the NRHP nomination, the building is sometimes mistakenly listed as being in Ridgewood, New Jersey. History The house in 2019, then a law office Today's East Ridgewood Avenue was once a colonial road linking the Saddle River (to the west) and the Hackensack River (to the east). Generations of the prolific Zabriskie family would raise children and crops and livestock in the area for over 200 years. Albert Jacob Zabriskie, a great-grandson of patriarch Albrycht, inherited one-third of his father's 225 acres in 1796, and built the 1805 house using materials salvaged from his father's home directly across the road. Albert Jacob left the house to his son Peter Albert Zabriskie in 1835, who left it to his own son Albert Peter Zabriskie in 1875, who left it to his niece Anna Zabriskie in 1904, who finally sold it in 1924 after 119 years of family ownership. Since then, the historic home was remodeled into professional offices, the lot was subdivided to a half-acre, and the surrounding land was converted into the Fashion Center shopping complex and a suburban housing development and NJ Route 17. Still, despite the many changes over the years, the 1805 stone farmhouse has kept virtually the same appearance from the road, and remains one of Bergen County's best-preserved examples of its Dutch Colonial heritage.

It is believed capable of generating earthquakes of at least magnitude , and there is evidence of such a quake approximately 1,000 years ago, possibly the same earthquake documented on the Seattle Fault 24 miles (38 km) to the north.; .  Geology  Hypothesized structure of the west end of the Seattle Uplift, showing left-lateral strike- slip movement if shortening is from the southwest (arrow). SF = Seattle Fault, TF = Tacoma Fault, EPZ = East Passage Zone. From , fig. 18B. The Tacoma Fault - actually a zone of connected faults - was first suspected from gravitational surveying in the 1960s, subsequently confirmed by seismic reflection and other geophysical data, and traced by detailed Lidar mapping; trenching and other paleoseismological studies have documented late Holocene uplift., p. 2. It extends west to the small town of Allyn (near the tip of Hood Canal), terminating at the same north-striking geophysical anomaly (tentatively named the Tahuya Fault) that terminates the Seattle Fault to the north. To the east one strand is aligned with Commencement Bay and the Puyallup River, other strands (or related faults) cross the East Passage of south-central Puget Sound. How far east these faults extend is not known, but probably as far as the Kent Valley. Seattle Uplift The Tacoma Fault Zone marks the south end of the Seattle Uplift, of which the similar and related Seattle Fault Zone marks the north end. This uplift is believed to be either a slab of rock about 15 km thick being pushed up a ramp, or a wedge being popped up between these two faults, by tectonic forces from the south or south-west as tectonic plates riding on top of the Juan de Fuca Plate are pushed against the North American craton.See cross-sections in Fig. 17 in . The relationship of the Seattle Uplift with other neighboring blocks, and the nature of the faults between them, is not well known. If tectonic strain is from the south, and therefore perpendicular to the Seattle and Tacoma Faults, the motion on them should be entirely dip-slip (vertical). If tectonic strain is from the south-west (see adjoining diagram), perpendicular to the Rosedale monocline, and also to the Olympia Fault (south-west boundary of the Tacoma Basin) and South Whidbey Island Fault (north-east of the Seattle Basin), both of which are parallel to the Rosedale monocline (and also to the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament, whose significance here is not known), then there should be some component of left- lateral strike-slip motion on parts of the Seattle and Tacoma faults., p. 24. There has been a suggestion that the position of the Seattle and Tacoma faults may correlated with strain accumulation in the Olympic Mountains (to the west),. but this is yet to be worked out.  Hazard  Based on observed length (actual length is probably substantially greater) the Tacoma Fault is believed capable of generating an earthquake of at least magnitude 7, comparable to the earthquake on the Seattle Fault 1100 years ago (A.D. 900-- 930)., p. 11\\\\. There is evidence of similar earthquake on the Tacoma Fault between A.D. 770--1160; these are probably connected, but it is not known whether they are the same. Although this would release only one percent of the energy of a magnitude 9 subduction zone earthquake, in being closer to the surface and confined to a smaller area damage would be more severe. It has been estimated that such an earthquake on the similar Seattle Fault would damage 80 bridges in the Seattle--Tacoma highway corridor, comparable to an estimated 87 bridges damaged in all of western Washington from a M 9 subduction earthquake. For a M 6.7 quake on the Tacoma Fault it was estimated that 20 to 35 bridges would be damaged; losses to the regional economy due just to the damaged highway infrastructure would be over $3 billion.. Calculations of ground motions for a M 7.1 earthquake on the Tacoma Fault indicates that most of Tacoma would experience moderate damage (depending on type of construction and local conditions). Heavy damage would be expected in a zone just north of the fault, especially on Maury Island, and extending across Federal Way to the cities of Auburn and Kent.. Computer simulations show that the same M 7.1 earthquake would generate a tsunami. It is expected that the industrial areas on Commencement Bay, most of the low-lying areas on the Puyallup River delta (including Fife), and parts of Interstate 5 would be inundated within about five minutes. Strong shaking may cause slope failures, including landslides; underwater landslides may cause additional tsunamis. The small beach communities common along Puget Sound, usually at the base of high bluffs, will thus be doubly endangered, by landslides and tsunamis.. See also .

Constitutional Law Cases and Materials, Concise Thirteenth Edition. Foundation Press, NY: 2009, p. 583 A group of naval officers who were discharged prior to their tenth year of commissioned service, as a result of not being promoted, received a lower rate of separation pay than female officers who were permitted to remain in service longer and receive three additional promotion board opportunities. As a result, the female officers who failed to be promoted received a higher rate of separation pay over their male counterparts. Ballard, a male officer who was passed over earned $15,000 in separation pay, but if he had been a similarly situated female officer, he argued that he would have received over $200,000 in separation pay. Ballard had also served as an enlisted sailor, but his eighteen years of total service was not enough to earn a military retirement. Although Justice Harry Blackmun's clerk pointed this out in a memorandum, Blackmun responded \\"We are first of all, dealing with the military and not with some civilian set-up, and I suppose this adds a protective factor to the government's position.\\"Joshua E.

Plot Diablo, the leader of the Demons motorcycle gang, is about to be executed for the murder of a young woman. Confronting the victim's sister Gail (Sarah Buxton), he proclaims his innocence and vows to return before being killed via electric chair. A year passes and Spring Break has come to Miami. Two football players, Skip (Nicolas de Toth) and Ronny (Rawley Valverde) are amongst the partygoers for the week-long festivities. While Spring Break is occurring, a mysterious biker appears and begins to dispatch people. The back of his bike has a lever that when pulled (combined with a button pushed by the biker) causes the victim to undergo a treatment similar to the electric chair. When Ronny ends up a victim of the mysterious killer, Skip attempts to find Ronny with the help of Gail, who works as a bartender during Spring Break. The duo soon find Ronny and learn that local police chief Strycher (John Saxon) and physician Doc Willet (Michael Parks) have covered up Ronny's death in order for the partygoers not to worry. However, as the body count rises, Gail and Skip begin to wonder if Diablo made good on his promise to return from the dead or is someone else responsible. Meanwhile, Trina, Diablo's girlfriend, is relaxing at the gang's old hideout. She puts headphones on and is listening to music when a figure appears. She assumes it's Diablo back from the dead. It's not until he grabs her violently that she realizes it's not. Trina is slammed on the couch and then the biker pulls a live wire out of the wall, and attaches it to Trina's headphones. Volts of electricity run through Trina's body, killing her slowly, and painfully. A confrontation at a local tire yard between Gail and the biker reveals that the killer is Reverend Bates (Lance Le Gault), who thinks Spring Break is nothing more than an excuse for sins. Considering himself a \\"guardian angel\\", he feels all sinners must die like Diablo, \\"death by electrocution\\". Bates also confesses to being the real killer of Gail's sister. Skip arrives in time and fights off Bates. As the duo run, Bates hops on his bike and goes after them only to trip his bike on a stray tire. Bates goes off the bike onto an electric field and like those he murdered and Diablo, dies by electrocution. The next day, Skip and Gail decide to leave Florida and head to Ohio, where Skip hails from.

He stated a 1996 interview that he found the story \\"too similar to [his earlier film] Seven Blood-Stained Orchids\\" and decided before shooting began that his name would not appear on the film.Palmerini, Luca M.; Mistretta, Gaetano (1996). \\"Spaghetti Nightmares\\". Fantasma Books. p. 70. . Screenwriter Harry Kirkpatrick (also known as James Justice) was given the job of directing, and received sole directorial credit, though he convinced Lenzi to remain on the set in an uncredited advisory capacity throughout the entire production. For years, many horror film fans thought Harry Kirkpatrick was an alias for Lenzi, but Lenzi has stated in interviews that there really was a Harry Kirkpatrick who wrote and co-directed that film.

Another of his works, Bunker Bean, helped popularize the term \\"flapper\\". Life and career Harry Leon Wilson was born in Oregon, Illinois to Samuel and Adeline (n√©e Kidder). His father was a newspaper publisher, and Harry learned to set type at an early age. He began work as a stenographer after leaving home at 16, and he worked his way west through Topeka, Kansas, Omaha, Nebraska, Denver, Colorado, and eventually to California. He was a contributor to the histories of Hubert Howe Bancroft, and became the private secretary to Virgil Bogue. In December 1886, Wilson's story The Elusive Dollar Bill was accepted by Puck magazine. He continued to contribute to Puck and became assistant editor in 1892. Henry Cuyler Bunner died in 1896 and Wilson replaced him as editor. The publication of The Spenders allowed Wilson to quit Puck in 1902 and devote himself full-time to writing. > I had to live ten years in New York. It was then a simple town, with few > street lights north of Forty-second street. Now the place is pretty terrible > to me, perhaps the ugliest city in the world. I decided that the only way to > get out of New York was to write a successful novel. So I tried with The > Spenders and when I got a substantial advance from publishers, I quit my job > and beat it for the high hills of Colorado. > > ‚ÄîHarry Leon Wilson Wilson returned to New York where he met Booth Tarkington in 1904. Tarkington and Wilson traveled together to Europe in 1905. The two completed the play The Man from Home in 1906 in Paris. The play was a resounding success and was followed by more collaborations with Tarkington, but none repeated the success of the first. Wilson was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1908. Wilson returned from Europe and settled permanently into the Bohemian colony at Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, which included Jack London, Mary Hunter Austin, George Sterling, Upton Sinclair, Xavier Martinez, Ambrose Bierce, Alice MacGowan, Sinclair Lewis, Francis McComas, and Arnold Genthe. It was during this period that Wilson wrote the books for which he is best known: Bunker Bean (1913) and Ruggles of Red Gap (1915). After a brief stint in Hollywood, he composed Merton of the Movies in 1922. In 1912, Wilson married Helen MacGowan Cooke, the daughter of Grace MacGowan and the niece of Alice MacGowan. Two years later, someone attempted to murder Alice MacGowan by poison and to steal her diamonds and cash; Wilson and writer Jimmy Hopper became amateur detectives, but the perpetrator was never discovered. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website (). In March 1922, Wilson fought and lost a highly publicized \\"duel of fists\\" with landscape painter Theodore Morrow Criley. Carmel was collectively humiliated when the sordid details of their long- standing feud made banner headlines in the San Francisco press and was given prominent coverage across the country on the International News Wire, including stories in the Los Angeles Times and New York Times.San Francisco Examiner, 30 March 1922, pp. 1, 3.Los Angeles Times, 31 March 1922, p. I-13.New York Times, 31 March 1922, p. 13. It was revealed that their argument originated with \\"a light romantic\\" love scene between Criley and Wilson‚Äôs wife in the 1921 production of Pomander Walk at Carmel‚Äôs Forest Theatre. Wilson sent Criley a series of accusatory letters, including a 24-page invective, and demanded satisfaction in this \\"affair of honor\\". He spent three months in Honolulu undergoing physical training and instruction in boxing, then he returned and the two men met on \\"a high cliff overlooking the sea\\". Criley thrashed Wilson in ten minutes.Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette, 9 April 1922, p. 11.The Capital News (Madison, Wisconsin), 13 April 1922, p. 11. A severe auto accident in 1932 greatly affected Wilson's health during his remaining years, and he died of a brain hemorrhage on June 28, 1939 in Carmel. Personal Wilson was married three times. His first wife was Wilbertine Nesselrode Teters Worden, whom he married in 1898. The marriage ended in divorce in 1900. In 1902, he married Rose Cecil O'Neill Latham. O'Neill and Wilson worked together at Puck, and she was the illustrator for four of his books; they divorced in 1907. Wilson's black and white pit bull dog named Sprangle was the inspiration for Rose O'Neill's biscuit porcelain Kewpie dog figure, known to the world as \\"Kewpiedoodle dog\\" and sold worldwide by importer George Borgfeldt.(cite International Rose O'Neill Society, Bonniebrook Museum, curator Susan Wilson.) Wilson married Helen MacGowan Cooke in 1912. They had two children: Harry Leon Wilson, Jr. and Helen Charis Wilson. Cooke and Wilson divorced in 1927.

Consensus theory contrasts sharply with conflict theory, which holds that social change is only achieved through conflict. Under consensus theory the absence of conflict is seen as the equilibrium state of society and that there is a general or widespread agreement among all members of a particular society about norms, values, rules and regulations. Consensus theory is concerned with the maintenance or continuation of social order in society. Consensus theory serves as a sociological argument for the furtherance and preservation of the status quo. It is antagonistic to conflict theory, which serves as a sociological argument for modifying the status quo or for its total reversal. In consensus theory, the rules are seen as integrative, and whoever doesn't respect them is a deviant person. Under conflict theory, the rules are seen as coercive, and who transgresses them is considered an agent of change.

Altarpiece of the Church of St. Jerome. The Royal Monastery of St. Jerome () is a Roman Catholic Hieronymite monastery in Granada, Spain. Architecturally, it is in the Renaissance style. The church, famous for its architecture, was the first in the world consecrated to the Immaculate Conception of Mary.  History  The monastery was founded by the Catholic Monarchs Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon in Santa Fe outside the city of Granada, during the siege of the latter city, the last stage of the Reconquista. The construction of the current buildings in Granada properly began in 1504, and the monastery relocated at that time. The principal architect and sculptor was Diego de Silo√©; others involved as architects or sculptors included Jacopo Torni (from Florence), Juan de Arag√≥n, Juan Bautista V√°zquez the Younger (V√°zquez el Mozo), Pedro de Orea, and Pablo de Rojas, the last three associated with the Granadan school of sculpture. The Hieronymites are an Augustinian order. The monastery church follows the usual plan for churches of this order, a Latin Cross with an elevated choir at the foot and the altar behind a wide staircase. The mannerist altarpiece of the main chapel is considered the point of departure of Andalusian sculpture as such; it is mainly the work of Pablo de Rojas. The richly decorated Renaissance interior features coffering, scalloping and sculptures, and is a late work of Renaissance humanism. The iconographic program highlights the military and the heroic grandeur of the Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, known as the Gran Capit√°n (\\"Great Captain\\"), who is buried in the crossing with his wife, Do√±a Maria de Manrique. As of 1513, the church was under construction under the leadership of Jacopo Torni 1513. Upon his death in 1526, the task devolved to Diego de Silo√©. The main chapel was completed in 1522 and the bodies of the Great Captain and his wife were moved from the Casa Grande of the Convent of Saint Francis. Although occupied again today by the same order of monks as at the time of its founding, the monastery has undergone many vicissitudes, including invasion by the French in the Napoleonic era during the Peninsular War. The Hieronymites were expelled and the monastery eventually became a near-ruin. The State undertook a restoration of the building in 1916‚Äì1920, hiring the architect Fernando Wihelmi for the job. The slender tower of the church had been demolished by the French, who used its stones to build the bridge known as the Puente Verde, which crosses the River Genil, linking the Paseo de la Bomba to the Avenida de Cervantes. Only in the 1980s was the tower re-erected; the project was completed in 1989.  Architecture  The monastery has two cloisters, each built around a garden. The older of the two has more genuinely Renaissance decoration: seven arcosolia in the style of chapels, richly adorned in classical style, configure a funerary space that was originally intended to receive the Great Captain's remains into the monastery. The second cloister, now the enclosure of the monastery's community of monks, was the residence of the Empress Isabella of Portugal on her wedding voyage after her marriage to Charles I of Spain (Holy Roman Emperor Charles V). The gateway that separates the grounds of the monastery from the Calle Rector L√≥pez Argueta is, indeed, original to the monastery, but had disappeared in the 19th century and was only returned to its position in the 1960s after being found abandoned in a courtyard of in the Vega de Granada. The sculpture of the Virgin of Sorrows on the gate is not original. From the beginning of 2004 until March 2005, the main altarpiece underwent restoration work under the aegis of the Ministry of Culture; during this time, the altarpiece was covered by a giant blow-up photo of itself.

Rabbi Nadel is celebrated as an expert in all facets of Torah and Talmudic knowledge. Biography Gedaliah Nadel was born in ≈†iauliai, Lithuania to Rabbi Reuven Keshel. In 1936, his family immigrated to Israel and settled in the Balfouria Colony in what is now Northern Israel. After briefly studying in Yeshiva in Tel Aviv, he switched to the Lomzha Yeshiva in Petach Tikvah. There, he studied under Rabbi Elazar Menachem Shach. As a child, Gedaliah was known for his diligence and devotion to studying Torah, reportedly studying for up to eighteen hours consecutively.Dei'ah Vedibur, June 9, 2004, HaRav Gedaliah Nadel, zt\\"l Afterwards Gedaliah studied under Rabbi Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz, known as Chazon Ish, who molded him into his principal student. Rabbi Nadel said that the Chazon Ish garnered knowledge in medical science by reading medical journals.http://www.cross- currents.com/archives/2009/06/24/a-y-karelitz-m-d/comment-page-1/#comments http://parsha.blogspot.com/2009/06/is-it-important-how-chazon-ish-knew.html Rabbi Nadel married the daughter of Rabbi Eliyahu Weiner, a student of the Chofetz Chaim. Following the wedding, they lived in Jerusalem for a short while, before moving to Bene Barak. There he lived an ascetic life. When the Chazon Ish realized his dream of establish a special community of religious devotees, he chose Rabbi Gedaliah Nadel to lead the community. As leader of the community, such leaders as Rabbi Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky, and his son Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky, turned to Rabbi Nadel for decisions. Rabbi Nadel's house was used as a gathering place for the Rabbinic personalities of his day, such as Rabbi Shach and Rabbi Y.Y. Kanievsky. Rabbi Nadel also briefly served as the Rosh Yeshiva of the Vishnitz Hasidic yeshiva. Rabbi Nadel would learn Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed immediately after praying Shacharis vattikin.B'Torato Shel Rav Gedaliah, p. ◊ï (Hebrew). Rabbi Nadel asserted that certain concepts mentioned in the Torah and Talmud that were not of a legalistic nature were not necessarily to be taken literally.http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/haazinu/sto.html His writings were analyzed and taken into account during the Slifkin affair. Rabbi Natan Slifkin himself subscribes to views espoused by Rabbi Nadel, including acceptance of evolution and belief \\"that the world was billions of years old.\\"http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2009/06/btoraso-shel-rav-gedaliah.html Rabbi Nadel maintained that it is acceptable to believe that the Zohar was not written by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and that it had a late authorship.An Analysis of the Authenticity of the Zohar (2005), p. 39, with \\"Rav E\\" and \\"Rav G\\" later identified by the author as Rabbi Eliyahu Dessler and Rabbi Gedaliah Nadel, respectively (Rabbi Dr. Marc Shapiro in Milin Havivin Volume 5 [2011], Is there an obligation to believe that Rebbe Shimon bar Yochai wrote the Zohar?, p. ◊ô◊ë [PDF page 133]): \\"Rav G [Gedaliah Nadel] told me that he was still unsure as to the origin and status of the Zohar, but told me it was my absolute right to draw any conclusions I saw fit regarding both the Zohar and the Ari.\\" Rabbi Nadel's teachings have continued to exert influence on Hareidi leaders.http://parsha.blogspot.com/2009/08/is-rav-kanievsky-now- heliocentrist.html Works Many of Rabbi Nadel's lectures were collected by his various students and two volumes were published under the title \\"Shiurei Reb Gedaliah.\\"See B'Torato Shel Rav Gedaliah, p. ◊ò (Hebrew). \\"B'Torato Shel Rav Gedaliah,\\" a compilation of Rav Gedaliah's teachings prepared from audio recordings,B'Torato Shel Rav Gedaliah, p. ◊ñ (Hebrew). was published by Rabbi Yitzchak Sheilat, one of Rabbi Nadel's main students,http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2009/06/btoraso-shel-rav- gedaliah.html and at the personal request of Rabbi Nadel.B'Torato Shel Rav Gedaliah, p. ◊ò (Hebrew). \\"B'Torato Shel Rav Gedaliah\\" was banned by three prominent Bnei Barak rabbis because of its support of Darwin's theory of evolution, including sentences such as \\"Regarding [the idea that] the creation of man in the image of God marked the end of a long process which started with a non-cognizant animal which gradually evolved until this creature was given a human mind... this is an accurate description.

It is an analogue of MDA where the heterocyclic 4-position oxygen from the 3,4-methylenedioxy ring has been replaced with a methylene bridge. 5-APDB (3-Desoxy-MDA) is an analogue of 6-APDB where the 3-position oxygen has been replaced with a methylene instead. 6-APDB, along with 5-APDB, was first synthesized by David E. Nichols in the early 1990s while investigating non- neurotoxic MDMA analogues. In animal studies, 6-APDB fully substitutes for MBDB and MMAI but not for amphetamine or LSD. In vitro, 6-APDB has been shown to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine with IC50 values of 322 nM, 1,997 nM, and 980 nM, respectively. These values are very similar to those of MDA, but with those for the catecholamines slightly lower in comparison, perhaps more similarly to MDMA. In contrast, 5-APDB is highly selective for serotonin. Though 6-APDB does not substitute for amphetamine in rats at the doses used in referenced study, based on its in vitro profile it can be suggested that it may have amphetamine-like effects at higher doses. The unsaturated benzofuran derivative 6-APB, or 6-(2-aminopropyl)benzofuran is also known, but the difference in pharmacological effects between 6-APB and 6-APDB is unclear. 6-APDB is a class B drug in the UK since June 10, 2013. It is banned by a blanket law on benzofurans and related compounds.

Plot When the gang discovers Marshall doesn't have any money to pay for the pizza they had ordered, he is forced to reveal that he was mugged by a man (Jon Dore) with a gun in Central Park. Lily is worried, and aided by Robin's gun-loving nature, expresses her interest to buy a gun for protecting herself. Marshall is frightened by this prospect, and then reveals he wasn't mugged; instead, he had visited the Central Park Zoo, and while standing close to a monkey cage, a monkey had swiped his wallet. Robin asks to interview him for her show, and he agrees to help boost her show's ratings. Marshall then privately explains to Barney and Ted that the monkey story is false, and that he really was mugged; he had made up the monkey to calm down Lily and stop her from buying a gun. Furthermore, he refuses to lie on television and risk hurting Robin's credibility as a journalist. Meanwhile, Barney is using the story of being mugged to pick up women. He is interrupted by a woman he had earlier convinced he was Neil Armstrong. He tells an even greater lie in an attempt to get out of it and suggests a threesome. The next morning, Ted brings along a scale model of the Empire State Building he had been working on; Ted had asked Robin to interview him about it, but she refused, but Ted brings it in case Marshall is unable to talk about the monkey mugging. Marshall is rattled when Robin reveals they have brought Bobo, the monkey from the zoo, as well, and the monkey will be separated from his mate Milly for committing the crime. Marshall finally refuses to talk about it, causing Robin to cut to a commercial and question him as to why. Marshall confesses that he made up the monkey story and Lily renews her intention to buy a gun, prompting Marshall to change his story back, but he again asserts that he was mugged by a human after being reminded what will happen to Bobo. Bombarded with everyone asking him what really happened, Marshall then says \\"I'm going to bed,\\" before leaving, with the Future Ted saying they never did find out what really happened, but in the end Lily never bought a gun, Robin's credibility remained intact, and Bobo and Milly lived out the rest of their days together at the zoo. Ted tells Barney he would be better off if he stopped telling lies but Barney replies Ted will someday tell this story and lie to give it a better ending. Robin is forced to interview Ted about his model, but as they are about to start, the monkey breaks free and snags a small doll nearby. It then proceeds to climb to the top of Ted's model, with the cameraman throwing paper aeroplanes at the monkey to get it off. Ted is left in disbelief that the ending from King Kong is being recreated before him, while Future Ted simply states \\"True story\\". Critical response Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club rated the episode \\"Zoo or False\\" with a grade B‚àí. Bowman claims that, although the script included many promising comedic elements, they \\"never seemed to settle into rhythm or find their natural relationship\\". The genuinely funny elements were overshadowed by a \\"lack of natural interaction or real emotion\\", originating with the cast's \\"unconvincing gales of laughter\\" at the idea of being mugged by a monkey. That stated, Bowman praised the episode addressing the line between a story and a truthful account, and a number of specific jokes in the episode. Amanda Sloane Murray of IGN gave the episode 9 out of 10. Cindy McLennan of Television Without Pity rated the episode with a grade C+. Lindsey Bahr of The Atlantic said regarding the fun factor of the episode: > It left me contemplating big \\"what is the point of it all\\" questions, which > is something a sitcom should never, ever, provoke its audience to do. The Time magazine compared the episode to Pale Fire of Vladimir Nabokov but only in romantic comedy form and praised the climax where Marshall said \\"she's my sister/she's my daughter\\".

History Harcourt Studio Photography is the result of the association of the brothers Lacroix and Germaine Hirschfeld (1900‚Äì1976) aka Cosette Harcourt,Harcourt, soixante-quinze ans de classicisme in Le Figaro on 10 September 2009 a photographer who had worked in the studio of the brothers Manuel. Initially, the company produced images for the press, at a time when prestigious photo studios like Nadar closed for lack of clients.Sous le glamour, le c√¥t√© obscur du studio Harcourt in Le Monde on 7 November 2009 The change in direction came when Cosette Harcourt started to specialize in black-and-white glamour photography of figures from French cinema and culture, always using 24 x 30 cm prints immediately recognizable for their distinctive style and lighting. This typical Harcourt style consists of a photo taken at close distance to the subject in its best light, generally creating a halo of light and dark, on a gray-to-black background. The attitude of the subject is personal, often wearing a slight smile, but somehow always seeming a little staged. Also, the Harcourt logo is featured prominently on every print. This Harcourt style was inspired by the work of French cinematographer Henri Alekan. Around the time of World War II, Cosette Harcourt, who was Jewish, married one of the Lacroix brothers. Together they created a magazine, called Stars, to serve as an outlet for studio photos. During the occupation of France by the Nazis, German officers and many members of the Vichy regime visited the studios, just as the Americans did after the French Liberation. After the war, Harcourt regained its momentum with movie star photography, continuing the tradition that made it successful initially. In 2000, at the initiative of Jack Lang, the French state bought the photos of Studio Harcourt from between 1934 and 1991: about 5 million negatives of 550,000 persons and 1,500 celebrities. Having a photo taken at Harcourt in 2010 reportedly costs about 1,900 Euros.

It was known in China as early as the Spring and Autumn period, and survived through the age of the abacus; pupils in elementary school today still must memorise it. The Chinese multiplication table consists of eighty-one terms. It was often called the nine-nine table, or simply nine-nine, because in ancient times, the nine nine table started with 9√ó9: nine nines beget eighty-one, eight nines beget seventy-two ... seven nines beget sixty three, etc. two ones beget one. In the opinion of Wang Guowei, a noted scholar, the nine-nine table probably started with nine because of the \\"worship of nine\\" in ancient China; the emperor was considered the \\"nine five supremacy\\" in the Book of Change. See also Numbers in Chinese culture#Nine. It is also known as nine-nine song (or poem), as the table consists of eighty-one lines with four or five Chinese characters per lines; this thus created a constant metre and render the multiplication table as a poem. For example, 9x9=81 would be rendered as ‚Äú‰πù‰πùÂÖ´ÂçÅ‰∏Ä‚Äù, or \\"nine nine eighty one\\", with the world for \\"begets\\" \\"Âæó\\" implied. This makes it easy to learn by heart. A shorter version of the table consists of only forty-five sentences, as terms such as \\"nine eights beget seventy-two\\" are identical to \\"eight nines beget seventy-two\\" so there is no need to learn them twice. When the abacus replaced the counting rods in the Ming dynasty, many authors on the abacus advocated the use of the full table instead of the shorter one. They claimed that memorising it without needing a moment of thinking makes abacus calculation much faster. The existence of the Chinese multiplication table is evidence of an early positional decimal system: otherwise a much larger multiplication table would be needed with terms beyond 9√ó9\\\\.

Rivera was the ‚Äúgreatest influence‚Äù in preventing Rizal from falling in love with other women while Rizal was traveling outside the Philippines. Rivera's romantic relationship with Rizal lasted for eight years.Leonor Rivera, tagaloglang.com She was immortalized by Rizal as the character Mar√≠a Clara in the Spanish-language novel Noli Me Tangere. Her original hometown is in Camiling, Tarlac. Description Born as Leonor Bauson Rivera, a native of Camiling, Tarlac, was the daughter of Antonio Rivera and Silvestra Bauzon. Her father (whom Rizal calls \\"Uncle Antonio\\" in his letters) is a cousin of Rizal's father, Francisco Mercado. Austin Coates, Rizal's European biographer, described Rivera in Rizal: Philippine Nationalist and Martyr as a ‚Äúpretty woman‚Äù whose physical features included having a ‚Äúhigh forehead‚Äù, ‚Äúsoft and wavy hair‚Äù, a face that sported ‚Äúalmond eyes‚Äù, ‚Äúsmall and pensive mouth‚Äù, and ‚Äúengaging dimples‚Äù. Furthermore, Rivera was a talented, mature, and intelligent lady who played the piano and was gifted with a ‚Äúcharming singing voice‚Äù. Rivera studied at La Concordia College in Manila. Family background Rivera's family resided in Dagupan City from 1890 to 1891, when the railroad line between Manila and Dagupan was being constructed. Her parents had a clothing merchandise business there. The Riveras first lived on Torres Bugallon Avenue in a property belonging to Don Alejandro Venteres and Do√±a Rosario Laurel Villamil, a couple closely connected to the family. The family later moved to a house belonging to Don Andres Palaganas, a person related to Don Venteres by affinity. The son of Don Palaganas, Ciriaco (a former Dagupan municipal president), was the husband of Don Venteres's relative Paula Venteres. The second residence of the Riveras was located at a place presently known as Rivera Street. Relationship with Rizal A crayon sketch of Leonor Rivera drawn by Jos√© Rizal. Leonor Rivera and Rizal first met in Manila when Rivera was only 14 years old. When Rizal left for Europe on May 3, 1882, Rivera was 15 years of age. Their ensuing correspondence began when Rizal left a poem for Rivera saying farewell, and their letters to each other slowly became romantic in nature. The correspondence between Rivera and Rizal kept Rizal focused on his studies in Europe. They employed codes in their letters because Rivera's mother did not favour Rizal as a suitor for her daughter. A letter from Mariano Catigbac dated June 27, 1884 referred to Rivera as Rizal's ‚Äúbetrothed‚Äù. Catigbac described Rivera as having been greatly affected by Rizal's departure, frequently sick because of insomnia. When Rizal returned to the Philippines on August 5, 1887, Rivera was no longer living in Intramuros because she and her family had moved back to Dagupan, Pangasinan. Rizal wanted to meet Rivera and vice versa, but both were prohibited by their respective fathers; Francisco Mercado barred his son from meeting her in order to avoid putting the Rivera family in danger, as Rizal had by then been labeled a filibustero or subversive by the Spanish colonial government because of his novel, Noli Me Tangere. Rizal wanted to marry Rivera while he was still in the Philippines because of her uncomplaining fidelity, so they asked permission from his father one more time before his second departure. The meeting never happened. In 1888, Rizal stopped receiving letters from Rivera for a year, even as he kept sending letters to her. The reason for Rivera's silence was the connivance between Rivera's mother and an Englishman named Henry Charles Kipping, a railway engineer who fell in love with Rivera and was favoured by Rivera's mother.Leonor Rivera, Jose Rizal University, joserizal.ph Marriage to Kipping Rivera met Kipping at the house of Do√±a Carmen Villamil, who was a former classmate of hers at La Concordia College. Kipping was associated with the engineer Crisostomo Villamil, who supervised the Manila-Dagupan railroad line project at the time.No. 26: Leonor Rivera, dagupan.com Rivera and Kipping were married on June 17, 1890 in Dagupan. Their first childSome sources say that Carlos Sr. was their only child. See, e.g., Frank Charles Laubach Rizal: Man and Martyr (1936), Ch. 14 was Carlos Rivera Kipping Sr., who married Lourdes R√≥mulo. Death Rivera died on 28 August 1893 shortly after giving birth to her second child with Kipping. Shortly before she died, her last wish was to have the silver box containing the ashes of Rizal's burned letters be buried with her.

Post World War I Grey remained in France after World War I, involved mostly in private business and banking. In 1935 he married Cornelia O'Connor Wallace, born in Paris, France, on May 22, 1904, the daughter of James Charles O'Connor of Dallas, Texas, and Ivor Branch Tate, sister of J. Waddy Tate. Charles and Cornelia had two sons, James, born in 1936, and Michael, in 1939. 200px World War II At the outset of World War II, the Grey family remained in France. Both Charles and Cornelia were dismayed by the isolationist stance of the United States in the face of the German onslaught across the European continent, and they immediately volunteered their services in the defense of their country of adoption, not withstanding their U.S. citizenship. Cornelia joined I.P.S.A. (Infermi√®res, Pilotes, Secouristes de l'Air), as a nurse and ambulance driver, active on the front during the German offensive of June 1940, for which services she was attributed the \\"Croix de Guerre' citation. Charles Grey volunteered his service to MI-6, the British Secret Intelligence Service, under the code name of \\"L'ange Bleu\\", and was known as \\"The First Volunteer\\". Activities included organizing the evacuation of SIS station in Paris, and its commanders \\"Biffy Dunderdale\\" and Sir Peter Smithers June 14‚Äì23, 1940, via Bordeaux. After the armistice, in late 1940, the family moved to the United States by way of Spain and Portugal. In 1942 Grey became an early member of the Office of Strategic Services, and was active in its X-2 counter espionage division, based in Lisbon Portugal. He was also active in various capacities in Finland (Red Cross), Poland, North Africa, and in France where he was a member of the F-2 \\"Forces Fran√ßaises Combattantes\\" resistance network under code name \\"Gris\\". His World War II service earned him a number of citations including the French Legion of Honor and Resistance Medal , the Polish Golden Cross of Merit., the Order of the White Rose of Finland, and the King's Medal for Courage from Britain. Post World War II 200px Immediately following the liberation of Paris in 1944, the Grey family returned to their home there. Grey remained in U. S. diplomatic service in France, until his retirement in 1961. Following his divorce from Cornelia, Grey married Ivanka Boyovitch on July 8, 1960. Following his retirement, Grey remained a resident of Paris for the rest of his life. He returned to the United States periodically for family visits. On 20 February 1987, he was struck by a car in Manalapan, Florida. He died of his injuries at JFK Hospital in Atlantis, Florida on 6 March 1987, and was interred in Paris.

The group stars in the television series Impractical Jokers, which premiered on December 15, 2011. The program airs on truTV in the U.S. and on Comedy Central in the UK, Ireland, and India. Origin The comedians met in religion class during freshman year at Monsignor Farrell High School on Staten Island in 1990. They became interested in drama and improv and joined an improv club because \\"it was the only way to meet girls\\", as their private high school was only for boys. Sal Vulcano kept a list of words they felt embarrassed to say in a public setting. When searching for a name for their comedy troupe, Sal's list, which included \\"culottes\\", \\"gargoyle\\", and \\"nougat\\", was used. The group eventually chose \\"The Tenderloins\\". Career=Stage After finishing college, James Murray worked for the Staten Island Ferry where he ran into his friend Sal. They reminisced about their enjoyment doing improv. After reuniting with Joe and another friend, Mike Boccio, they practiced improv at Joe's house three days a week, for six months. The Tenderloins began in 1999 as a live improv comedy and sketch comedy troupe. The troupe briefly consisted of five members. However, Gideon Horowitz soon left the group for personal reasons. After the success of Impractical Jokers, the Tenderloins have also taken part in several American and international tours. They have performed in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, and participated in the San Francisco Sketch Comedy Festival and the Miami Improv Festival. Internet success In 2006, following years of live shows, the Tenderloins redirected their talents to filmed comedic sketches. Brian Quinn subsequently replaced Mike Boccio as the troupe's fourth member. The Tenderloins' comedic sketches have accumulated millions of views on YouTube, MySpace, Metacafe, and other websites. In 2007, the troupe won the $100,000 grand prize in the NBC It's Your Show competition for the sketch \\"Time Thugs\\". Television Following the troupe's online successes, the four were signed to develop a scripted comedy pilot for Spike TV based on their own lives. The pilot was shot on location in 2008 on Staten Island, as well as at other locations around New York City. Spike TV ultimately passed on the series. A second pilot starring the Tenderloins was officially selected for the 2009 New York Television Festival. On April 12, 2011, truTV announced a new series to star the Tenderloins. Impractical Jokers premiered on December 15, 2011, executive- produced by the troupe themselves. Season 1 consisted of 16 episodes. The first season was watched by over 32 million viewers. The show's second season premiered on December 13, 2012 and consisted of 28 episodes. Its third season had 31 episodes and premiered on January 2, 2014. On April 21, 2014, truTV announced that the series would be renewed for a 26-episode fourth season. With the fourth season renewal, a 6-episode spinoff series, Jokers Wild!, was also announced. The show was renewed for a fifth season, which began on February 2016. On July 22, 2016, a sixth season was announced, which began on February 9, 2017. After another successful season, Impractical Jokers was renewed for a seventh season that began on February 1, 2018. In March 2018 TruTV announced Impractical Jokers was renewed for an eighth season, which consists of 26 episodes and premiered on March 28, 2019. A feature-length movie, Impractical Jokers: The Movie, was released theatrically on February 21, 2020. In 2019, the troupe will star in a new TBS series, Misery Index, based on the card game \\"Shit Happens\\" created by Andy Breckman, who created and wrote the popular TV series Monk and the recent Netflix series The Good Cop.Petski, Denise, \\"TBS Picks Up Comedy Game Show 'Misery Index' Starring The Tenderloins To Series From 'Monk' Creator,\\" Deadline Hollywood, October 10, 2018 Live tour The Troupe has toured steadily over the last four years with its highly-successful, \\"Where's Larry?\\", \\"Santiago Sent Us,\\" & \\"Cranjis McBasketball\\" tours playing to hundreds of thousands of fans in the US and UK, including three sold-out nights at Radio City Music Hall, a sold-out Madison Square Garden, and five sold-out shows at London's O2 Arena. Radio In February 2017, Murr tweeted that he and the group had recorded the first episode of an upcoming limited-run show for SiriusXM Radio. On August 17, 2017, The Tenderloins Radio Show made its debut on SiriusXM Radio channel 94 (Comedy Greats). In the hour-long broadcast, the comedy troupe pranks friends and acquaintances, takes calls, answers emails from fans, and does sketches in a segment called \\"Tenderloins Theatre\\". PodcastsThe Tenderloins Podcast= The group began hosting a podcast in April 2012. =What Say You?= What Say You?, an occasional podcast hosted by Sal and Q, was named Best New Show at the 2013 Stitcher Awards. The increased popularity of What Say You sparked a friendly competition among the friends, spurring Joe and Murr to release their own Tenderloins podcast without the other two members. In 2015, What Say You? was nominated for the Comedy, Entertainment, and Best Produced Podcast Awards at the 10th Annual Podcast Awards. Sal and Q have stated that the podcast is their own side project, not a replacement of The Tenderloins Podcast. The group explained that it was difficult to coordinate the schedules of all four members outside of work, making it challenging to produce their troupe's official podcast with any regularity.

The peopling of India refers to the migration of Homo sapiens into the Indian subcontinent. Anatomically modern humans settled India in multiple waves of early migrations, over tens of millennia. The first migrants came with the Coastal Migration/ Southern Dispersal 65,000 years ago, whereafter complex migrations within south and southeast Asia took place. West Eurasian hunter-gatherers migrated to South Asia after the latest Ice Age, but before the onset of farming. Together with a minor number of ancient South Asian hunter-gatherers they formed the population of the Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC). With the decline of the IVC, and the migration of Indo- Europeans, the IVC-people contributed to the formation of both the Ancestral North Indians (\\"ANI\\"), who were closely related to west Eurasians, and the Ancestral South Indians (\\"ASI\\"), who were predominantly descended from ancient South Asian hunter-gatherers (\\"Ancient Ancestral South Indians\\" or \\"AASI\\") who were distantly related to the Andamanese. These two ancestral populations (ASI and ANI) mixed extensively between 1,900-4,200 years agoSrinath Perur, The origins of Indians. What our genes are telling us., Fountain Ink Quote: \\"Sometime between 1,900 to 4,200 years ago, profound, pervasive convulsive mixture occurred, affecting every Indo-European and Dravidian group in India without exception.\\" and created the peoples inhabiting the Indian subcontinent today, while the migrations of the Munda people and the Tibeto-Burmese speaking people from East Asia also added new elements. First modern human settlers=Pre- or post-Toba The dating of the earliest successful migration modern humans out of Africa is a matter of dispute. It may have pre- or post-dated the Toba catastrophe, a volcanic super eruption that took place between 69,000 and 77,000 years ago at the site of present-day Lake Toba. According to Michael Petraglia, stone tools discovered below the layers of ash deposits in India at Jwalapuram, Andhra Pradesh point to a pre-Toba dispersal. The population who created these tools is not known with certainty as no human remains were found. An indication for post-Toba is haplogroup L3, that originated before the dispersal of humans out of Africa, and can be dated to 60,000‚Äì70,000 years ago, \\"suggesting that humanity left Africa a few thousand years after Toba.\\" =Impact= It has been hypothesized that the Toba supereruption about 74,000 years ago destroyed much of India's central forests, covering it with a layer of volcanic ash, and may have brought humans worldwide to a state of near-extinction by suddenly plunging the planet into an ice-age that could have lasted for up to 1,800 years. If true, this may \\"explain the apparent bottleneck in human populations that geneticists believe occurred between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago\\" and the relative \\"lack of genetic diversity among humans alive today.\\" Since the Toba event is believed to have had such a harsh impact and \\"specifically blanketed the Indian subcontinent in a deep layer of ash,\\" it was \\"difficult to see how India's first colonists could have survived this greatest of all disasters.\\" Therefore, it was believed that all humans previously present in India went extinct during, or shortly after, this event and these first Indians left \\"no trace of their DNA in present-day humans\\" ‚Äì a theory seemingly backed by genetic studies. =Pre-Toba tools= Research published in 2009 by a team led by Michael Petraglia of the University of Oxford suggested that some humans may have survived the hypothesized catastrophe on the Indian mainland. Undertaking \\"Pompeii-like excavations\\" under the layer of Toba ash, the team discovered tools and human habitations from both before and after the eruption. However, human fossils have not been found from this period, and nothing is known of the ethnicity of these early humans in India. Recent research also by Macauly et al. (2005) and Posth et al. (2016), also argue for a post-Toba dispersal.Bradshaw Foundation, Human Migration Early Stone Age hominin fossils have been found in the Narmada valley of Madhya Pradesh. Some have been dated to 200- 700,000 BP. It is uncertain what species they represent. =Post-Toba Southern Coastal dispersal= By some 70-50,000 years ago, only a small group, possibly as few as 150 to 1,000 people, crossed the Red Sea. The group that crossed the Red Sea travelled along the coastal route around the coast of Arabia and Persia until reaching India, which appears to be the first major settling point. Geneticist Spencer Wells says that the early travellers followed the southern coastline of Asia, crossed about of sea, and colonized Australia by around 50,000 years ago. The Aborigines of Australia, Wells says, are the descendants of the first wave of migrations. The oldest definitively identified Homo sapiens fossils yet found in South Asia are Balangoda man. Named for the location in Sri Lanka where they were discovered, they are at least 28,000 years old. AASI Narashimhan et al. (2018) introduced the term AASI for these oldest human inhabitants, \\"Ancient Ancestral South Indian,\\" which were related to the East Asian, Onge (an Andamanese group) and Aboriginal Australian ancestors. It is distantly related to Andaman islanders. According to Narashimhan et al. (2019), \\"essentially all the ancestry of present-day eastern and southern Asians (prior to West Eurasian-related admixture in southern Asians) derives from a single eastward spread, which gave rise in a short span of time to the lineages leading to AASI, East Asians, Onge, and Australians.\\" =Relation to Andaman Islanders= Several genetic studies have found evidence of a distant common ancestry between native Andaman Islanders and the AASI/ASI ancestral component found in South Asians. Modern South Asians have not been found to carry the paternal lineages common in the Andamanese, which has been suggested to indicate that certain paternal lineages may have become extinct in India, or that they may be very rare and have not yet been sampled. Chaubey and Endicott (2013) further noted that \\"Overall, the Andamanese are more closely related to Southeast Asians than they are to present-day South Asians (as well as being closer to Southeast Asian Negritos and Melanesians).\\" Shinde et al. 2019 found either Andamanese or East Siberian hunter-gatherers fit as proxy for AASI \\"due to shared ancestry deeply in time.\\" According to Yelmen et al. (2019) the native South Asian genetic component (ASI) is distinct from the Andamanese and not closely related, and that the Andamanese are thus an imperfect and imprecise proxy for ASI. According to Yelmen et al, the Andamanese component (represented by the Andamanese Onge) was not detected in the northern Indian Gujarati, and thus it is suggested that the South Indian tribal Paniya people (who are believed to be of largely ASI ancestry) would serve as a better proxy than the Andamanese (Onge) for the \\"native South Asian\\" component in modern South Asians. According to Narashimhan et al. (2019), the \\"AASI\\" component in South Asians shares a common root with the Andamanese (as exemplified by the Onge) and is distantly related to the Onge (Andamanese), East Asians, and Aboriginal Australians (with those groups and the AASI sharing a deep ancestral split around the same time). =Relation to \\"Negritos\\"= The present-day Andamese are considered to be part of the \\"Negritos,\\" several diverse ethnic groups who inhabit isolated parts of southeast Asia.Snow, Philip. The Star Raft: China's Encounter With Africa. Cornell Univ. Press, 1989 () Based on their physical similarities, Negritos were once considered a single population of related people, but the appropriateness of using the label 'Negrito' to bundle together peoples of different ethnicity based on similarities in stature and complexion has been challenged. Recent research suggests that the Negritos include several separate groups, as well as demonstrating that they are not closely related to the Pygmies of Africa.S.

Piper, Hirofumi Matsumura, David Bulbeck (eds.), New Perspectives in Southeast Asian and Pacific Prehistory (2017), p. 92. According to Vishwanathan et al. (2004), the typical \\"negrito\\" features could also have been developed by convergent evolution. According to Gyaneshwer Chaubey and Endicott (2013), \\"At the current level of genetic resolution, however, there is no evidence of a single ancestral population for the different groups traditionally defined as 'negritos.\\" Basu et al. 2016 concluded that the Andamanese have a distinct ancestry and are not closely related to other South Asians, but are closer to Southeast Asian Negritos, indicating that South Asian peoples do not descend directly from \\"Negritos\\" as such. Sri Lankan Vedda Groups ancestral to the modern Veddas were probably the earliest inhabitants of Sri Lanka. Their arrival is dated tentatively to about 40,000‚Äì35,000 years ago. They are genetically distinguishable from the other peoples of Sri Lanka, and they show a high degree of intra-group diversity. This is consistent with a long history of existing as small subgroups undergoing significant genetic drift. Latest Glacial Maximum=Holocene After the last glacial maximum, human populations started to grow and migrate. With the invention of agriculture, the so-called Neolithic revolution, larger numbers of people could be sustained. The use of metals (copper, bronze, iron) further changed human ways of life, giving an initial advance to early users, and aiding further migrations, and admixture. According to Silva et al. (2017), multiple waves of migration from western Eurasia took place after the last Ice Age, both before and after the advent of farming in South Asia. According to Narasimhan et al. (2019), people related to Iranian hunter-gatherers were present in South Asia before the advent of farming. They mixed with Ancestral Ancient South Asians (AASI) to form the Indus Valley population. With the decline of the IVC after 1900 BCE and the arrival of the Indo-Aryans, IVC-people mixed with incoming Indo-Aryans, forming the Ancestral North Indians (ANI). Other IVC-people mixed with AASI forming the Ancestral South Indians (ASI). These two ancestral groups mixed in India between 4,200 and 1,900 years ago (2200 BCE-100 CE), whereafter a shift to endogamy took place, possibly by the enforcement of \\"social values and norms\\" during the Hindu Gupta rule. Reich et al. stated that ‚ÄúANI ancestry ranges from 39-71% in India, and is higher in traditionally upper caste and Indo-European speakers‚Äù. Basu et al. (2016) note that mainland India harbors two additional distinct ancestral components which have contributed to the gene pools of the Indian subcontinent, namely Ancestral Austro-Asiatic (AAA) and Ancestral Tibeto-Burman (ATB). West Eurasian ancestry=Pre-farming Iranian hunter-gatherers Narasimhan et al. (2019) and Shinde et al. (2019) conclude that west Eurasian ancestry was already present before the advent of farming in South Asia. Metspalu et al. (2011) detected a genetic component in India, k5, which \\"distributed across the Indus Valley, Central Asia, and the Caucasus\\". According to Metspalu et al. (2011), k5 \\"might represent the genetic vestige of the ANI\\", though they also note that the geographic cline of this component within India \\"is very weak, which is unexpected under the ASI-ANI model\\", explaining that the ASI-ANI model implies an ANI contribution which decreases toward southern India. According to Metspalu et al. (2011), \\"regardless of where this component was from (the Caucasus, Near East, Indus Valley, or Central Asia), its spread to other regions must have occurred well before our detection limits at 12,500 years.\\" Speaking to Fountain Ink, Metspalu said, \\"the West Eurasian component in Indians appears to come from a population that diverged genetically from people actually living in Eurasia, and this separation happened at least 12,500 years ago.\\" Moorjani et al. (2013) refer to Metspalu (2011) as \\"fail[ing] to find any evidence for shared ancestry between the ANI and groups in West Eurasia within the past 12,500 years\\". CCMB researcher Thangaraj believes that \\"it was much longer ago\\", and that \\"the ANI came to India in a second wave of migration that happened perhaps 40,000 years ago.\\"Srinath Perur (December 2013), The origins of Indians. What our genes are telling us., Fountain Ink Possible migration of Iranian neolithic farmers According to Gallego Romero et al. (2011), their research on lactose tolerance in India suggests that \\"the west Eurasian genetic contribution identified by Reich et al. (2009) principally reflects gene flow from Iran and the Middle East.\\" Gallego Romero notes that Indians who are lactose-tolerant show a genetic pattern regarding this tolerance which is \\"characteristic of the common European mutation.\\" According to Romero, this suggests that \\"the most common lactose tolerance mutation made a two-way migration out of the Middle East less than 10,000 years ago. While the mutation spread across Europe, another explorer must have brought the mutation eastward to India ‚Äì likely traveling along the coast of the Persian Gulf where other pockets of the same mutation have been found.\\" Mehrgarh (7000 BCE to c. 2500 BCE), to the west of the Indus River valley, is a precursor of the Indus Valley Civilisation, whose inhabitants migrated into the Indus Valley and became the Indus Valley Civilisation. It is one of the earliest sites with evidence of farming and herding in South Asia. According to Lukacs and Hemphill, while there is a strong continuity between the neolithic and chalcolithic (Copper Age) cultures of Mehrgarh, dental evidence shows that the chalcolithic population did not descend from the neolithic population of Mehrgarh, which \\"suggests moderate levels of gene flow.\\" They further noted that \\"the direct lineal descendents of the Neolithic inhabitants of Mehrgarh are to be found to the south and the east of Mehrgarh, in northwestern India and the western edge of the Deccan plateau,\\" with neolithic Mehrgarh showing greater affinity with chalcolithic Inamgaon, south of Mehrgarh, than with chalcolithic Mehrgarh. =Elamite- Dravidian hypothesis= While the IVC has been linked to the early Dravidian peoples, some scholars have suggested that their neolithic farmer predecessors may have migrated from the Zagros mountains to northern South Asia some 10,000 years ago.https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/jgen/087/02/0175-0179 According to David McAlpin, the Dravidian languages were brought to India by immigration into India from Elam. Franklin Southworth also states that the Dravidian Languages originated in western Iran and that publications and research are \\"further evidence of [the relationship between Dravidian languages and Elamite] viability\\". According to Renfrew and Cavalli-Sforza, proto-Dravidian was brought to India by farmers from the Iranian part of the Fertile Crescent, but more recently Heggerty and Renfrew (2014) noted that \\"McAlpin's analysis of the language data, and thus his claims, remain far from orthodoxy\\", adding that Fuller finds no relation of Dravidian language with other languages, and thus assumes it to be native to India. Renfrew and Bahn conclude that several scenarios are compatible with the data, and that \\"the linguistic jury is still very much out.\\" According to another study in 2016, evidence support that the neolithic farmers ancestry component forms the main ancestry of modern South Asians. These neolithic farmers migrated from the fertile crescent, most likely from a region near the Zagros mountains in modern day Iran, to South Asia some 10,000 years ago. Indus Valley Civilisation Shinde et al. (2019) and Narasimhan et al. (2019), analysing remains from the Indus Valley civilisation (of parts of Bronze Age Northwest India and East Pakistan), conclude that the IVC-population was a mixture people related to Iranians and AASI: According to Shinde et al. (2019) about 50-98% of the IVC-genome came from people related to early Iranian farmers, and from 2-50% of the IVC-genome came from native South Asian hunter-gatherers sharing a common ancestry with the Andamanese. According to Narasimhan et al. (2019) found 45‚Äì82% Iranian farmer-related ancestry and 11‚Äì50% AASI (or Andamanese-related hunter-gatherer ancestry). The analysed samples of both studies have little to none of the \\"Steppe ancestry\\" component associated with later Indo-European migrations into India. The authors found that the respective amounts of those ancestries varied significantly between individuals, and concluded that more samples are needed to get the full picture of Indian population history. Indo-Aryans Scheme of the theoretical Indo-European migrations, of which the Indo-Aryan migrations form a part, from c. 4000 to 1000 BCE according to the Kurgan hypothesis. * The magenta area corresponds to the assumed Urheimat (Samara culture, Sredny Stog culture) and the subsequent Yamna culture. * The red area corresponds to the area which may have been settled by Indo-European-speaking peoples up to c. 2500 BCE. * The orange area to 1000 BCE. In the second millennium BCE people from the Sintashta culture migrated through Bactria-Margiana Culture and into the northern Indian subcontinent (modern day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal). The Indo-Aryan migrations started in approximately 1,800 BCE, after the invention of the war chariot, and also brought Indo-Aryan languages into the Levant and possibly Inner Asia. The Proto-Indo-Iranians, from which the Indo-Aryans developed, are identified with the Sintashta culture (2100‚Äì1800 BCE), and the Andronovo culture, which flourished ca. 1800‚Äì1400 BCE in the steppes around the Aral sea, present-day Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The proto-Indo-Iranians were influenced by the Bactria-Margiana Culture, south of the Andronovo culture, from which they borrowed their distinctive religious beliefs and practices. The Indo-Aryans split off around 1800‚Äì1600 BCE from the Iranians, whereafter the Indo-Aryans migrated into the Levant and north-western India. Lazaridis et al. (2016) notes that the demographic impact of steppe related populations on South Asia was substantial and forms a major component in northern India. Lazaridis et al.'s 2016 study estimates 6.5‚Äì50.2 % steppe related admixture in all modern South Asians with higher caste and Indo-Aryan speaking groups having more steppe admixture than others. Post-IVC: ANI and ASI ancestral components in the Indian population A series of studies since 2009-2019 have shown that the Indian subcontinent harbours two major ancestral components, formed in the 2nd milllennium BCE, namely the Ancestral North Indians (ANI), which is broadly related to West Eurasians, and the Ancestral South Indians (ASI) which is clearly distinct from ANI. ANI formed out of a mixture of \\"Indus Periphery-related groups\\" and migrants from the steppe, while ASI was formed out of \\"Indus Periphery-related groups\\" who moved south and mixed further with local hunter-gatherers. ASI formed as mixture of \\"Indus Periphery-related\\" group who moved south and mixed further with AASI-related ancestry. \\"Indus Periphery-related\\" group did not carry steppe admixture and were instead mixture of Neolithic Iran-related ancestry and hypothesized AASI-related ancestry. According Narasimhan et al. 2018, the genetic makeup of the ASI population consisted of about 73% AASI (native South Asian hunter-gatherer) and about 27% from Iranian-related peoples. This estimate is similar to that of Reich et al. in their more recent analysis, who in 2018 note that the ASI have a West-Eurasian ancestry component (derived from Iranian-related farmers) which Reich estimates at about 25% of their ancestry (not detected in his initial 2009 analysis), with the remaining 75% of the ancestry of the ASI deriving from native South Asian hunter-gatherers. ANI formed out of a mixture of \\"Indus Periphery-related groups\\" and migrants from Bronze age steppe. Lazaridis et al. (2016) notes that the demographic impact of steppe related populations on South Asia was substantial. According to the results, the Mala, a south Indian Dalit population with minimal Ancestral North Indian (ANI) along the 'Indian Cline' have nevertheless ~ 18 % steppe-related ancestry, showing the strong influence of ANI ancestry in all populations of India. The Kalash of Pakistan are inferred to have ~ 50 % steppe-related ancestry, with the rest being of Iranian farmers ancestry. Reich et al. stated that ‚ÄúANI ancestry ranges from 39-71% in India, and is higher in traditionally upper caste and Indo-Aryan speakers‚Äù. Austroasiatic According to Ness, there are three broad theories on the origins of the Austroasiatic speakers, namely northeastern India, central or southern China, or southeast Asia. Multiple researches indicate that the Austroasiatic populations in India are derived from (mostly male dominated) migrations from southeast Asia during the Holocene. According to Van Driem (2007), According to Chaubey et al. (2011), \\"AA speakers in India today are derived from dispersal from Southeast Asia, followed by extensive sex-specific admixture with local Indian populations.\\" According to Zhang et al. (2015), Austroasiatic (male) migrations from southeast Asia into India took place after the lates Glacial maximum, circa 10,000 years ago. According to Arunkumar et al. (2015), Y-chromosomal haplogroup O2a1-M95, which is typical for Austrosiatic speaking peoples, clearly decreases from Laos to east India, with \\"a serial decrease in expansion time from east to west,\\" namely \\"5.7 ¬± 0.3 Kya in Laos, 5.2 ¬± 0.6 in Northeast India, and 4.3 ¬± 0.2 in East India.\\" This suggests \\"a late Neolithic east to west spread of the lineage O2a1-M95 from Laos.\\" According to Riccio et al. (2011), the Munda people are likely descended from Austroasiatic migrants from southeast Asia. According to Ness, the Khasi probably migrated into India in the first millennium BCE. According to a genetic research (2015) including linguistic analyses, suggests an East Asian origin for proto-Austroasiatic groups, which first migrated to Southeast Asia and later into India. Tibeto-Burmese According to Cordaux et al. (2004), the Tibeto-Burmans possibly came from the Himalayan and north-eastern borders of the subcontinent within the past 4,200 years. A wide variety of Tibeto-Burman languages are spoken on the southern slopes of the Himalayas. Sizable groups that have been identified are the West Himalayish languages of Himachal Pradesh and western Nepal, the Tamangic languages of western Nepal, including Tamang with one million speakers, and the Kiranti languages of eastern Nepal. The remaining groups are small, with several isolates. The Newar language (Nepal Bhasa) of central Nepal has a million speakers and a literature dating from the 12th century, and nearly a million people speak Magaric languages, but the rest have small speech communities. Other isolates and small groups in Nepal are Dura, Raji‚ÄìRaute, Chepangic and Dhimalish. Lepcha is spoken in an area from eastern Nepal to western Bhutan. Most of the languages of Bhutan are Bodish, but it also has three small isolates, 'Ole (\\"Black Mountain Monpa\\"), Lhokpu and Gongduk and a larger community of speakers of Tshangla. Crossovers in languages and ethnicity One complication in studying various population groups is that ethnic origins and linguistic affiliations in India match only inexactly: while the Oraon adivasis are classified as an \\"Austric\\" group, their language, called Kurukh, is Dravidian. The Nicobarese are considered to be a Mongoloid group, and the Munda and Santals Adivasi are \\"Austric\\" groups, but all four speak Austro-Asiatic languages. The Bhils and Gonds Adivasi are frequently classified as \\"Austric\\" groups, yet Bhil languages are Indo-European and the Gondi language is Dravidian.
