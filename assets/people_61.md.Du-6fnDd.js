It is divided into two segments; one travels through the neighborhood of Ditmars, located within Astoria, and the other acts as a service road for the Grand Central Parkway near LaGuardia Airport in East Elmhurst. Route description Ditmars Boulevard begins at an intersection with Shore Boulevard in Astoria on the banks of the East River, just north of Astoria Park. The road continues to the east until it reaches the western edge of LaGuardia Airport, terminating at an intersection with 81st Street, north of Bowery Bay Boulevard and near Marine Air Terminal. Southeast of this intersection, on the other side of the Grand Central Parkway, the road begins again, as a continuation of a short segment of 86th Street (which itself begins at 23rd Avenue) in East Elmhurst. This segment is one-way eastbound, merging with the eastbound exit ramp of exit 6 on the Grand Central, which serves 94th Street. At 94th Street, a main arterial which provides access to and from the airport, the road becomes two-way. It provides an eastbound entrance ramp, and shortly intersects a traffic circle with 23rd Avenue that also provides an alternate entrance to the airport (closer to terminals C and D). Now taking a more southern direction, Ditmars continues east along the Grand Central and merges with an exit 8 offramp. Shortly after, Ditmars terminates at an intersection with Astoria Boulevard, continuing south as 111th Street for one more block before terminating at Northern Boulevard (NY 25A). History The earliest Ditmars ancestor was Jan Jansen Ditmarsen (John the Son of John from Ditmars) who immigrated to America from Holstein in Germany. The first Ditmars settled in Dutch Kills about 1647. Ditmars Boulevard and the East River was the site of Dr. Dow Ditmars' home. The doctor, who died in 1860 at age 90, was held in high esteem by the community. A son, Abram Ditmars, later became the first Mayor of Long Island City in 1870. Later, Steinway and Sons, the piano manufacturer, had a final assembly factory on Ditmars Boulevard until the 1960s. Transportation Astoria ‚Äì Ditmars Boulevard station is the last stop on the New York City Subway's BMT Astoria Line (). The approach to the Hell Gate Bridge is on a masonry viaduct over that station. In addition, the MTA Bus-operated Q69 bus runs along 21st Street and the western half of Ditmars Boulevard, while the New York City Bus- operated Q48 bus operates from LaGuardia Airport and runs along the eastern half of Ditmars Boulevard from 102nd Street to Astoria Boulevard before going down 108th Street toward its eastern terminus at Flushing ‚Äì Main Street. In popular culture The boulevard is the location of Brett Weir's apartment in Jerky Boys: The Movie, as a symbol for moving up in the city.

Flexitarian is a portmanteau of the words flexible and vegetarian, signifying its followers' less strict diet pattern when compared to other vegetarian pattern diets. Terminology Vegetarianism is the strict practice of abstaining from consuming meat. Flexitarianism is a neoteric term that gained a considerable increase in usage in both science and public sectors in the 2010s. Flexitarian was listed in the mainstream Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary in 2012. In 2003, the American Dialect Society voted flexitarian as the year's most useful word. Other neologisms used as synonyms for semi-vegetarianism are demi-vegetarianism and reducetarianism.  Motivations  Common reasons for adopting a semi-vegetarian diet include religious restrictions, weight management, health consciousness, issues relating to animal welfare or animal rights (see ethical omnivorism), the environment (see environmental vegetarianism), or reducing resource use (see economic vegetarianism). Flexitarians may have attitudes and endorsement behavior concerning health issues, humanitarianism, and animal welfare. Varieties The main fundamental of some specific semi-vegetarian diets is about the inflexible adherence to a diet that omits multiple classes and types of animals from the diet in entirety, rather than a sole focus on reduction in consumption frequency. Some examples include: *Macrobiotic diet: a plant-based diet and it may include occasional fish or other seafood. Cereals, especially brown rice, are the staples of the macrobiotic diet, supplemented by small amounts of vegetables and occasionally fish. Some advocates of the macrobiotic diet promote a vegetarian (or nearly vegan) approach as the ideal. *Pescetarian diet: someone who follows this diet eats fish and/or shellfish and may or may not consume dairy and eggs. The consumption of meat, such as poultry, mammal meat and the flesh of any other animal is abstained from. In the past, some vegetarian societies used to consider it to simply be a less-strict type of vegetarianism.\\"International Health Exhibition\\", The Medical Times and Gazette, 24 May 1884, 712. \\"There are two kinds of vegetarians‚Äîone an extreme form, the members of which eat no animal food whatever; and a less extreme sect, who do not object to eggs, milk, or fish. The Vegetarian Society ... belongs to the latter more moderate division.\\" This is no longer the case now that modern day vegetarian societies object to the consumption of all fish and shellfish. *Pollotarian diet: someone who follows this diet eats chicken and/or other poultry and usually eggs as well. A pollotarian would not consume seafood, the meat from mammals, or other animals often for environmental, health or food justice reasons. *Kangatarian diet: is a recent practice of following a diet that cuts out meat except kangaroo on environmental and ethical grounds. Several Australian newspapers wrote about the neologism \\"kangatarianism\\" in February 2010, describing eating a vegetarian diet with the addition of kangaroo meat as a choice with environmental benefits because indigenous wild kangaroos require no extra land or water for farming and produce little methane (a greenhouse gas), unlike cattle or other farm animals.  Dietary pattern  All semi-vegetarians could accurately be described as people who eat a plant-based diet, but there is no firm consensus how infrequently someone would have to eat meat and fish for their diet to be considered a semi-vegetarian diet rather than a regular plant-based diet. The average American consumed an estimated of meat in 2018, so comparatively a semi-vegetarian would have to eat much less. Recurring conditions of a semi- vegetarian include consuming red meat or poultry only once a week. One study defined semi-vegetarians as consuming meat or fish three days a week. Semi- vegetarianism may be the default diet for much of the world, where meals based on plant materials provide the bulk of people's regular energy intake. One estimate is that 14% of the global population is flexitarian. Society and culture In the United Kingdom, there was increased demand for vegan products in 2018. A 2018 study estimated that the amount of UK consumers following a ‚Äúmeat-free diet‚Äù had increased to 12%, including 6% vegetarians, 4% pescetarians and 2% vegans. A 2018 poll indicated that 10% of adult Canadians considered themselves as vegetarians or vegans, among whom 42% were young adults. A high estimate for meat consumption per person in 2007 was (for Luxembourg), including consumption of beef, pork, turkey, and chicken. In 2019, an international group stated that the adoption of the flexitarian diet would \\"save lives, feed 10 billion people and all without causing catastrophic damage to the planet,\\" when compared to the current western diet. The term flexitarian has been criticized by some vegetarians and vegans as an oxymoron because people following the diet are not vegetarians but omnivores as they still consume the flesh of animals.

Believed to be the last living signatory of Cuba's 1940 Constitution, he served as Senator (1940‚Äì1948) and became part of the opposition against both Fulgencio Batista and Fidel Castro, ultimately going into exile in the 1960s. Biography Ochoa speaks to members of the Florida House of Representatives on March 15, 2006 Dr. Ochoa was one of seven children in a poor family. He studied dentistry in Havana and graduated in 1937. During this time he became involved in politics and was one of the delegates of the Partido Aut√©ntico to the constitutional convention which wrote the Cuban Constitution of 1940. Dr. Ochoa helped found two political parties: the Partido Autentico in 1934 and the Partido Ortodoxo in 1947. Ochoa was first elected as a Senator in 1940 and served in that office until 1948. He was opposed to Fulgencio Batista, who suspended the Cuban Constitution of 1940 following a coup d'√©tat in 1952. Dr. Ochoa was arrested 32 times because of his political beliefs and went into exile in 1960, following the takeover of the country by Fidel Castro, who had formerly been a member of the Partido Ortodoxo. However, he returned to Cuba in 1961, hoping that Cuba's 1940 Constitution would be reinstituted following the Bay of Pigs invasion. However, the revolutionary government stayed in power and Ochoa left Cuba for good years later. He first went to Venezuela where he practiced dentistry until 1965 when he went to the United States. During the academic years beginning in fall of 1968 and 1969, Dr. Ochoa taught Spanish at Pender Public High School in Pender Nebraska. He also taught at Wayne State College in Nebraska and then at a Catholic school in Chicago. In 1971, he moved to Miami and lived in government-subsidized apartment. In the 1980s, he practiced dentistry with the Miami Medical Team that traveled to Nicaragua to help the Contras fighting the Sandinistas. In 1933, he married Domitila Nunez (died 1969) and they had two children, Pura America and Carlos Emilio Ochoa Nunez (died 1996). In 1986 he married Martha Herrera. Ochoa died of cardiac arrest at his home in Miami on June 27, 2007, one week short of his 100th birthday. He is buried at Flagler Memorial Park.

Early years  Bateman grew up in an environment of social movements, his mother Clementina Cay√≥n was an advocate of political prisoner and militant in the Liberal Revolutionary Movement (MRL) a dissident group from the Colombian Liberal Party. Bateman was raised mostly by his stepfather Jorge Olarte. Bateman was born in Santa Marta in the Caribbean region northern Colombia among colonial Spanish houses. At the age of eight Bateman was run over by an automobile while crossing a street in the neighboring city of Barranquilla fracturing his tibia and fibula. He almost lost his leg in this incident and left him with a defect in his leg. He swam for therapy. Communist youth Years later he met Carlos Romero who was arriving from Argentina, where he had been an active militant in the Communist Party of Argentina during the presidency of Juan Domingo Per√≥n. Romero influenced Bateman and convinced him to join the Communist Youth (Juventudes Comunistas, JUCO) and form the first group of communists in the Colombian state of Magdalena. In 1957, while a student at the Liceo Celed√≥n, civic strikes broke out throughout Colombia to protest the dictatorship of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla. These strikes were organized by the two main political parties, the Liberal and Conservative parties. Bateman participated in the marches and became a student activist. Carlos Romero then married Bateman's sister, Matilde, and Bateman traveled with them to the capital city Bogot√°. In Bogot√° he went to high school at the Colegio Panamericano while still participating in the JUCO. In 1963 Bateman was arrested for a month for distributing subversive propaganda and was later arrested again for participating in a protest related to the high cost of living. He became political secretary of the National Secretariat of the Young Communists and participated in 1963 as a delegate for the organization in the 16th Komsomol Congress in Moscow where he received a course in social sciences and criticized the dogmatic study that characterized the school of squares. Guerrilla militant Influenced by the Cuban Revolution and Maoism, communists in Colombia began to conceive armed struggle as the only way to seize power. In 1966 Communist party followers split after following different communist tendencies. Some of these joined the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which the communist party supported. Because he was a communist, Bateman began being persecuted by Colombian government forces. He became the personal secretary of Manuel Marulanda V√©lez, Jacobo Arenas and Ciro Trujillo performing political duties for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) until he left in 1970. The FARC wanted to achieve power through political struggle and by empowering the peasants while Bateman and his followers wanted to take the cities and believed that the armed and political struggle should be focused on nationalism, Bolivarianism and American-centrist. 19th of April Movement Jaime Bateman died in a plane crash near Ancon Hill, Panama (1983). In the remains of the airplane HK-2139P also was found the corpse of Colombian congressman Antonio Escobar Bravo After coming to these beliefs Bateman developed an urban political and military movement in 1970 along with Carlos Toledo Plata, the main leader of the Socialist ANAPO. After the dubious elections of April 19, 1970 in which conservative candidate Misael Pastrana Borrero won over the ANAPO candidate and former dictator Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, Bateman launched the 19th of April Movement with the banner: \\"With the arms, with the people, with Mar√≠a Eugenia Rojas to the power\\", however the Directorate of the ANAPO denied such support for armed groups. The group recruited numerous guerrilla fighters and began targeting government and military objectives. In 1974 the M-19 stole from the Quinta de Bol√≠var the sword of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, threatening not to return it until peace was achieved in Colombia. Bateman also ordered the robbery of some five thousand weapons from a military garrison in Bogot√° known as the Canton Norte on January 6, 1981. He also ordered the Dominican embassy siege during which he proposed an amnesty for political prisoners held in La Picota prison and dialogues to start formal peace talks. Then Senator Germ√°n Bula Hoyos and who proposed the law to give amnesty to political prisoners was the first government official to meet him in person. In December of 1981, Bateman demanded to be put on the presidential ballot, but President Turbay rejected the proposal. Bateman announced that \\"if there are no elections for everyone, there will be no elections for anyone.\\" This prompted the government to send troops into the cities during the 1982 presidential election.  Death  Bateman died on April 28, 1983 in a plane crash while en route to Panama. His body was not found for 9 months.

A death squad composed of Rio Military Police was responsible for carrying out this act of violence. The group supposedly did so out of revenge for the killing of four police officers two days prior, who were allegedly involved in the extortion of drug traffickers. After arriving to the favela of Vig√°rio Geral on August 29, 1993, the squad spent two hours traveling around wearing hoods over their heads and sporadically shooting at local residents, leaving 21 innocent people dead. \\"Among the deceased were seven men playing cards in a bar and eight members of a family, including a 15-year-old girl, killed inside their home.\\" After the federal and Rio de Janeiro state governments commenced a series of official investigations that year, charges were brought against thirty three people: twenty-eight military policemen who were believed to belong to infamous death squad \\"Cavalos Corredores\\" (the \\"Galloping Horses\\"), three civil policemen and two civilian employees of the civil police. By 1998, the number of people charged increased to the total of fifty-two, but only two had actually been convicted thus far. Six policeman had been convicted as of 2003, yet according to a BBC newspaper published in August, only two were actually in prison as the other four were released with the expiration of the time periods for their appeal hearings.  Implications of the Vig√°rio Geral massacre  The theme that has continued to dominate Brazilian society from the early twentieth century up until the present, is the accepting attitude held by middle-upper class citizens and policemen towards the use of violence. Police violence directed towards citizens continues to be a problem in Brazil decades after the 1993 Vig√°rio Geral Massacre, and is evident in its murder statistics. In one annual Brazilian Forum on Public Security report, it found that police killed 2,212 people in 2013, and increasing to a total of 3,022 the following year, Brazil's national murder rate was 30 deaths for every 100,000 people. This data contrasts greatly with that of the United States, which, according to the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services Division crime report of 2013, had a much lower rate of only 4.5 murders for every 100,000 people. One major factor that directly contributes to Brazil's high murder rate (police killing citizens, and citizens killing each other and officers) are its laws on both intentional and unintentional murder. According to Brazil's homicide laws, the penalty for intentional murder ranges from six to twenty years of imprisonment except in more severe instances which it could increase to thirty, and only one to three years for unintentional homicides. As if to favor those who commit serious felonies, Brazilian law states that the maximum penalty for any crime is 30 years, and those sentenced to more than 19 years in prison are automatically granted retrials. In 1998, Chicago Tribune Foreign Correspondent Laurie Goering made several interesting points in her article, showing that there was more to Brazil's murder culture than just its comparatively (to the U.S. and elsewhere) lenient laws. Due to the fact that Brazil's court systems were slow, inconsistent, saw only 8 percent of all cases, and brought \\"showy sentences\\" with small jail time, Goering explained that \\"most people favor street justice by police, including executions of criminals caught in the act.\\" See also *List of massacres in Brazil  References External links *‚ÄúMurder.‚Äù The Federal Bureau Of Investigation, 2013. *Rocha, Jan. ‚ÄúRio Police Killings Condemned.‚Äù BBC, August 28, 2003, sec.

It currently operates 16 monobrand stores, including locations in New York, London, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Miami, and in Milan's Via Montenapoleone. In 2016 Mayhoola Investments acquired Balmain for a figure reported as close to ‚Ç¨500 million ($548 million).Valentino‚Äôs Qatari Owners Acquire Balmain JUNE 22, 2016 Balmain was 70 percent controlled by heirs of Alain Hivelin. Balmain does not regularly release financial information, but Les Echos estimated its revenue in 2015 at ‚Ç¨120 million (about $136 million), growing from an estimated ‚Ç¨30 million (about $34 million) in 2012. Balmain expected to reach a revenue of ‚Ç¨150 million in 2017, 90% of which is generated by the wholesale channel, and is also putting more effort into direct retail. History Balmain was born in 1914 in France. His father owned a drapery business and his mother and sister owned a fashion boutique where he often worked after his father's death in 1921. He attended the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in 1933‚Äì1934, with intent to study architecture but instead ended up spending the majority of his time designing dresses. After working for atelier Robert Piquet as a freelance artist and spending time with Edward Molyneux, he left school to work for Molyneux. In the late 1930s, he served in the French air force and the army pioneer corps. After peace was declared, he worked at Lucien Lelong and opened his own fashion house under his name at 44, rue Fran√ßois 1er in Paris. He released his first collection in October 1945 and his first fragrance, Jolie Madame in 1949.‚ÄúBalmain.‚Äù Vogue English. Accessed January 24, 2014. Ruth Ford, photographed by Carl Van Vechten, 1947 In the period following World War II, Pierre Balmain was \\"a king of French fashion\\" and outfitted stars including Ava Gardner and Brigitte Bardot, the Nicaraguan first lady Hope Portocarrero,Yaeger, Lynn. \\"Balmain Nouveau.\\" Vogue (October 2007), p. 254‚Äì256. and Queen Sirikit of Thailand. Marlene Dietrich wore Balmain clothes that she selected in \\"No Highway in the Sky\\" (1951). Successors After Balmain's death in 1982, the house was led by Erik Mortensen, described by Vogue as \\"Pierre Balmain's right hand\\". Mortensen had joined the house to work as Balmain's assistant in 1951. After succeeding Balmain, Eric Mortensen worked to maintain the brand aesthetic in the ever- living world of couture while still maintaining the progressive spirit of creativity in the fashion industry. The Balmain house recruits Peggy Huynh Kinh in 1982 to provide artistic direction for women's ready-to-wear and women's and home accessories license studios. Eric Mortensen won two Golden Thimble awards for his haute couture collections, one for the Autumn/Winter 83/84 and one for the Autumn/Winter 87/88. He left the house in 1990. After his departure, designer Herv√© Pierre took over until 1992 working as director of ready-to-wear and haute couture. Possibly the most influential designer to take over at Balmain was Oscar de la Renta, who led the house between 1993 and 2002. Already a fashion veteran before joining Balmain, De la Renta brought a famous face to the brand Balmain. He lived in New York City most of his life, although he was born in the Dominican Republic and became a naturalized United States citizen in 1971. He fit into the Balmain design aesthetic, with an eye for detail and classic silhouettes. He, like Balmain, preferred modest and simple design rather than extremely ornamental and flashy styles. Couture had been suffering at the time since it was an extremely impractical business, so Oscar joined the brand in order to challenge himself and to help it through the beginning of the decline of couture.Duffy, Martha. \\"Mais Oui, Oscar!\\" Time 141, no. 6 (February 8, 1993): 68. After Oscar de la Renta's departure Christophe Decarnin joined the house in 2005. Contrary to all the designers before him, Decarnin insisted on bringing the brand into the 21st century. He favored expensive prices and flashy pieces that sharply contrasted with the label's reputation for its classic and luxurious designs. He was considered a \\"star designer\\", and the brand became more about his star status than about its clothes. In April 2011, Balmain announced that Decarnin was to be replaced by Olivier Rousteing. Rousteing had joined the company in 2009, after attending a prestigious French fashion school and working under Roberto Cavalli. While he liked Decarnin's aesthetic, he wanted to orient the label towards the finer aspects of French couture. At the time of his appointment, Rousteing was a relatively unknown designer, and has brought a fresh take on the brand's aesthetic that remains to this day. He was credited with adding an Asian influence to the clothing, as Asia comprises a huge part of the brand's buyers.‚ÄúExclusive Interview with Balmain‚Äôs Olivier Rousteing.‚Äù The D‚ÄôVine.

Her parents filed a missing person report to the police and a search for her was undertaken in the subsequent weeks by several organisations, including the mainstream media and NGOs. Police were able to find CCTV footage, from a nearby camera, showing her being dragged into a white van the night she went missing. Her murder has not yet been solved. Discovery and identification On the morning of 17 September 2007, a brand-new gym bag was left in front of a shop lot in PJS 1/48, Petaling Jaya, discovered by the shop owner. It contained an unidentified child's naked body which had been stuffed in the fetal position; police believed that she had been dead for more than six hours before the discovery. A cucumber and a brinjal were found stuffed inside her genitals and had caused her rectum to rupture. It was determined that bacterial infection had contributed to her death. At the time, Nurin Jazlin's parents were not able to identify the body as their daughter's due to the changes in her physical features; it was even suggested that the child might be a foreigner, as she lacked the scar which would be caused by the mandatory BCG vaccination against tuberculosis. Her parents initially maintained hope that their daughter might be alive and were the victims of several prank calls from people claiming that Nurin was under their care. Later DNA tests conducted confirmed the body as Nurin Jazlin's. Her body was later claimed by her family from the Kuala Lumpur Hospital (HKL) and she was buried at the Muslim cemetery in Taman Ibukota, Setapak, Kuala Lumpur, on 21 September after the Friday noon prayers. Investigation The nature of her brutal torture and eventual death at the hands of an unknown assailant, suspected to be a psychopathic killer, sparked outrage throughout the country. Malaysian media and Internet blogs have been filled with anger and disbelief in reaction to the case, and the murder is widely considered to be \\"the country's most horrifying crime in years.\\" The case led to a statement by then Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi about the possibility of publicising the list of convicted child sex offenders. Inspector-general of police Musa Hassan initially suggested that he would investigate whether Nurin's parents had been negligent, an offence which could lead to charges under Section 33 of the Child Act 2001. The suggestion provoked public outcry, most prominently from Lee Lam Thye, chairman of the Malaysia Crime Prevention Foundation, who responded that punishing the parents further would be unfair. On 28 September, federal agents raided a shop in Section 7, Shah Alam, where they arrested four men and one woman between the ages of 27 and 35 in connection with the murder. The woman was released after questioning, while the men were remanded to police custody for seven days. However, they were released unconditionally three days later due to lack of evidence. Police then proceeded to put up an award of RM10,000 for information leading to the arrest of Nurin's killer; an anonymous private businessman agreed to match that with an additional RM10,000. On 2 October, police arrested an Indonesian woman at a market in Nilai, Negeri Sembilan; when confronted, the woman attempted to swallow a SIM card she was carrying. On 11 October, police released video footage captured by a CCTV camera near a shoplot in Petaling Utama, Petaling Jaya, where the sports bag containing the body of eight-year-old Nurin was found. The CCTV footage was sent on 26 September to the FBI to enhance the clarity of the blurred images. The first clip, captured at about 1 pm on September 16, showed a motorcyclist carrying a sports bag (with Nurin's body in it) and leaving it at the shoplot. The second clip, recorded one hour later, showed a woman loitering around the shoplot who was later picked up by three men arriving at the scene. The enhanced footage, however, failed to reveal the face of the motorcyclist and the license plate of the motorcycle. In 2018, Nurin's father pleaded to the police to reopen his daughter‚Äôs case and investigate it using the latest technology.

Seely at the wheel of Packard automobile at front of motorcade; Jennings seated beside him. Fred Loring Seely (December 22, 1871 - March 14, 1942) was a newspaperman, chemist, inventor and philanthropist. Born to Uriah and Nancy Hopping Seely, in Monmouth, New Jersey, Fred Seely first worked for the Parke-Davis pharmaceutical company and later became an executive for his father-in-law Edwin Wiley Grove's \\"Paris Medicine Company,\\" a patent medicine business based in Tennessee. In 1906, with Mr. Grove's financial backing, Seely founded the Atlanta Georgian daily newspaper. He also took on many socially active causes, one of which was the exposure of chain gang labor practices in Georgia. State prisoners were being rented out for fifty cents a week, and many of these inmates received poor treatment at the hands of their temporary employers. Seely used his newspaper as a pulpit to broadcast the abuses of the chain-gang labor system. He was instrumental in helping to terminate this form of modern slave labor in Georgia. Many of his advertisers, however, had profited by using the prison laborers, and these well-to-do clients of The Atlanta Georgian were furious with Seely for his activism in this cause. They subsequently dropped their support for his newspaper, and this precipitated the sale of the paper to Randolph Hearst in 1912.Garrett, Vol.II, p.498 After this, Seely went to North Carolina where in 1913 he built the Grove Park Inn with his father-in-law Edwin Wiley Grove. In 1917, he purchased Biltmore Estate Industries from Edith Vanderbilt and changed the name to Biltmore Industries, Inc.. The death of Mrs. Vanderbilt's husband and the great flood of the French Broad and Swannanoa Rivers in 1916 (which submerged the original Biltmore Industries site) inspired the Vanderbilts to sell the enterprise. This small factory was primarily a home-spun wool weaving and woodworking business. Seely employed many deaf persons to work in his factory; two of his own siblings, in fact, were deaf. He also acted as the architect and builder of his home \\"Overlook\\" (sometimes called \\"Seely's Castle\\")on Sunset Mountain overlooking Asheville. After Seely's death in March 1942 in Asheville, North Carolina, his widow, Evelyn Grove Seely, moved to the Battery Park Hotel in downtown Asheville. In 1949 Mrs. Seely sold the expansive home to what would become Asheville- Biltmore College, the forerunner of what is now the University of North Carolina at Asheville. The college operated at the Sunset Mountain castle site until 1961. The relationship between Seely and his father-in-law, Edwin W. Grove, who would not sell him the Grove Park Inn, apparently was troubled from the start, and never improved. Writes Helen Wykle, who studied their relationship and wrote on the relationship between the two men: \\"Seely managed the Grove Park Inn for his father-in-law for nearly 14 years but was unable to convince E.W. Grove to sell him the hotel. The resulting animosity between the two put a strain on their relationship and on Fred Seely's marriage to Grove's daughter Evelyn. Seely had come to Asheville to work with Grove as a chemist. Grove's Chill Tonic and other \\"medicinal\\" remedies made both Grove and Seely large fortunes, but it also made them bitter rivals. Grove's jealousy and his competitive nature were never overcome and Seely, talented and charming as he was, never was successful in charming or winning the affection of his father- in-law. The correspondence and the ensuing lawsuit in which Seely sued Grove for breach of promise were bitter and futile engagements for Seely.\\" Grove died at the Battery Park Hotel in Asheville, N.C., on January 27, 1927. However, Seely continued his lawsuit against Grove's estate. The 1928 court case was heard in St. Louis where Grove's Paris Medicine Company was based. The suit ended in 1928 when a presumed final will was found that purportedly proved that Grove had not promised Seely any special remuneration or ownership rights for his years of work for Paris Medicine Company and the Grove Park Inn. As a result of Seely's failed lawsuit, Gertrude (Grove's second wife), their son Eddie, Jr., and Evelyn Grove Seely (daughter from Grove's first marriage to sweet Mary Louisa Moore Grove) became the will-decreed co-owners and beneficiaries of the trust income from the Grove Park Inn operations. Gertrude Grove subsequently sued for widow's rights (contrary to the prohibitive terms of Edwin Grove's will) to force the other parties to buy her out of the Grove Park Inn property. This successful suit resulted in the forced sale of the Grove Park Inn. When she died later in 1928 her son Eddie Jr., inherited her share of Paris Medicine Company and became owner of two thirds of Grove's estate. Evelyn Grove Seely retained ownership of one-third of the estate and the Battery Park Hotel and various properties which include Seely's Castle. Fred Seely returned to Asheville after the failed lawsuit and continued his philanthropic works. He was instrumental in convincing Eerste Nederlandsche Kunzyd-fabriek Arnhem (E.N.K.A.) to build a new rayon fiber factory on vacant farmland adjacent to Hominy Creek in Buncombe County. A 2011 web exhibit narrative by Robert Cuningham entitled \\"Fred Loring Seely and American E.N.K.A.\\" portrays the details of this factory locating in Buncombe County. This new factory, completed in a record time of one year (1928‚Äì1929), provided up to 5,000 new and steady-income jobs for the local workforce. E.N.K.A.'s factory produced rayon cord for tires that were used on equipment in Europe to help the Allies win World War II. Seely also continued with his famous Biltmore Industries (located in the shadow of the immense Grove Park Inn) even as the Great Depression bore down on the U.S. economy. Fred Loring Seely died March 14, 1942 at the age of 70. He is buried at Calvary Episcopal Church cemetery in Fletcher, N.C., along with his wife Evelyn (d. 1953), his second daughter Mary Louise Seely Beard (d. 1950), and his youngest son Fred Loring Seely, Jr. (d.1991). On June 17, 2017 the Grovewood Gallery, located on the grounds of the Biltmore Industries. held a centennial celebration honoring a century of history of wool weaving and wood working and art and antique automobiles.

Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th President of the United States, died of throat cancer at the cottage on July 23, 1885. The house was made a New York State Historic Site in 1971. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs The cottage was originally owned by Joseph William Drexel, a New York banker and friend of Grant, and Grant would spend the last six weeks of his life there. Author and publisher Mark Twain gave Grant a $25,000 advance to write his memoirs; Grant completed the manuscript just three days before he died. During the next two years, sales of the work netted his family nearly $450,000 in royalties, saving his widow, Julia, from destitution. For decades after his death, thousands of Civil War veterans made a pilgrimage to this shrine outside Saratoga Springs. Thousands more visit Mt. McGregor annually to see the original artifacts preserved at this historic site. Visitors can tour the historic house museum which has been furnished exactly as it was on the day Grant died. Some of the original floral arrangements from the funeral are on display, and the bed in which he died is shown in the bedroom. Also seen is the clock that was at the cottage, stopped at 8:08am by Frederick Dent Grant, who then reached over and touched his father's forehead for the last time. A marker is located outside the cottage on the spot where Grant had his last look of the valley; it had to be fenced off to stop visitors from chipping off pieces as souvenirs. A visitor center and gift shop are also located there. A plaque is located a short distance away from the cottage and memorializes the fact that Grant died there. A New York historic marker is located a few yards from the cottage. Marker From 1976 through 2014 the cottage was within the grounds of the now- closed Mount McGregor Correctional Facility, a New York State prison, and visitors had to pass a checkpoint.

It is specifically prohibited by law, which has been defined through a series of judicial decisions. However, juries composed solely of one racial group are legal in the United States. While the racial composition of juries is not dictated by law, racial discrimination in the selection of jurors (regardless of the jury's ultimate composition) is specifically prohibited. Depending on context, the phrases \\"all-white jury\\" or \\"all-black jury\\" can raise a host of expectationsamong them, as MIT social neuroscientist Rebecca Saxe notes, the expectation that deliberations may be less than fair. Current precedent and legal challenges Under the standard set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Strauder v. West Virginia and Batson v. Kentucky, the striking of a juror on account of race denies a defendant equal protection under the constitution. However the court held that a defendant is not entitled to a jury containing or lacking members of any particular race, and the striking of jurors for race-neutral reasons is permissible. This standard has been extended to civil trials in Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company and on the basis of gender in J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B.  United States  Following the American Civil War, the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution had abolished slavery and guaranteed basic civil rights to African-Americans; the Civil Rights Act of 1875 extended this to \\"public accommodation\\" and jury selection, including the establishment of criminal penalties for court officers who interfered: The United States Supreme Court ruled in 1880 in Strauder v. West Virginia that laws excluding black people from jury service violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment; yet in Virginia v. Rives (1879), the court denied an appeal from a black defendant who asked that black jurors be made at least one third of his jury, noting that an all-white jury was not in itself proof that a defendant's rights had been violated. Nevertheless, Southern states easily evaded Strauder and set up other ways than explicit legal bans to exclude black Americans from jury service. In 1883, the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was overturned entirely by the Supreme Court, in an 8-1 decision. In 1896, the landmark Plessy v. Ferguson decision enshrined the unofficial civil code termed Jim Crow, ranging from separate but equal accommodation to voter disenfranchisement and jury exclusion; blacks were thus denied access to the public, political, and judicial spheres. In the 1931 case of the Scottsboro Boys, nine black youths were accused of raping two white women, one of whom later recanted her testimony. Eight of the defendants were sentenced to death (although none would be executed). Defense attorney Samuel Leibowitz argued before the Alabama Supreme Court that black people had been kept off the jury rolls, and that names of black people had been added to the rolls after the trial to conceal this fact. The appeals in the case ultimately led to two landmark Supreme Court decisions. In Powell v. Alabama (1935), the Court ruled that criminal defendants are entitled to effective counsel, and in Norris v. Alabama (1935), that blacks may not be excluded systematically from jury service. Despite Norris, the practice of excluding black people from juries did not disappear. In 1985, the Supreme Court in Batson v. Kentucky addressed a situation where a prosecutor had used his peremptory challenges to strike all four black candidates from a jury and obtained a conviction against the black defendant. The defendant was not able to demonstrate that the state's court system systematically excluded black people from juries but nonetheless raised due process and equal protection arguments in his particular case. In Batson, the court ruled that the defendant could make a prima facie case for purposeful racial discrimination in jury selection by relying on the record and that a State denies a defendant equal protection in a trial before a jury from which members of his race have been purposely excluded. Batson did not eliminate the exclusion of black people from juries. Batson applied only in criminal trials, only to prosecutors, and only in situations where the challenged juror and the defendant were of the same race. The Mississippi Supreme Court noted, in reversing a 2004 murder conviction of a black man, where prosecutors used all 15 of their peremptory strikes to exclude black jurors: \\"racially motivated jury selection is still prevalent 20 years after Batson.\\" In 2010, a white man in Alabama appealed his murder conviction and death sentence after a trial by 11 white jurors and 1 black juror, stating that jury selection was tainted by racial discrimination in excluding additional black jurors from his jury.  Canada  Canada has also struggled with the issue of racial discrimination in jury selection, especially for First Nation people. In 2001, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) stopped producing band lists of First Nations people living on reserve for provincial jury rolls because of privacy concerns. The exclusion of this information from provincial jury rolls meant First Nations people living on reserves were not properly represented on juries. The removal of First Nations people living on reserves from provincial jury rolls directly collided with the Supreme Court of Canada‚Äôs 1991 decision of R. V. Sherrat [1991] 1 SCR 509 wherein the Court found that the ‚Äúrepresentativeness right‚Äù is an essential component of the right to trial by jury. In particular, the Court pronounced that: > ‚ÄúThe perceived importance of the jury and the Charter right to jury trial is > meaningless without some guarantee that it will perform its duties > impartially and represent, as far as is possible and appropriate in the > circumstances, the larger community. Indeed, without the two characteristics > of impartiality and representativeness, a jury would be unable to perform > properly many of the functions that make its existence desirable in the > first place‚Äù The Supreme Court of Canada in 2015 evolved the issue of a ‚Äúrepresentative right‚Äù in jury trials in the case of R. V. Kokopenance, [2015] SCR 28 wherein the Court held that ‚Äúan accused is not entitled to a jury that includes members of their own race or religion; rather, they are only entitled to a fair and honest process of random jury selection‚Äù The issue of ‚Äúrepresentative right‚Äù is not dead or a decided issue. In 2018 the Federal Government introduced Bill C-75 in response to the Coultan Boushie case. Bill C-75 eliminated peremptory challenges of jurors in criminal cases, thereby preventing the exclusion of jurors by both Crown and defense counsels. Bill C-75 became law on June 21, 2019 , which coincidentally happens to be National Indigenous Peoples Day in Canada.

Whiting presided over Glastonbury Abbey at the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries (1536‚Äì1541) under King Henry VIII of England. The king had him executed after his conviction for treason for remaining loyal to Rome. He is considered a martyr by the Catholic Church, which beatified him on 13 May 1895. Early life Richard Whiting was born near Wrington. He was educated at Glastonbury Abbey, and then at the Monk's Hostel at Cambridge, Camm OSB, Bede. Chapter IX \\"The Blessed Richard Whiting, Abbot of Glastonbury\\", Lives of the English Martyrs, Longmans, Green and Co., 1914 graduating with an MA in 1483. Career View of Glastonbury Abbey from the former location of the North transept in East direction to the choir. Whiting was ordained deacon in 1500 and priest in 1501. He returned to Cambridge in 1505 to take his doctor's degree. He served as camerarius at Glastonbury in charge of managing the dormitory, lavatory, and wardrobe of the community. After the death of the Abbot of Glastonbury, Richard Beere, in February 1525, the community elected his successor per formam compromissi, which elevates the selection to a higher ranking personage ‚Äì in this case Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. Wolsey obtained King Henry's permission to act and chose Richard Whiting. The first ten years of Whiting's rule were prosperous and peaceful. He was a sober and caring spiritual leader and a good manager of the abbey's day-to-day life.Huddleston, Gilbert. \\"Blessed Richard Whiting.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 23 Mar. 2013 Contemporary accounts show that Whiting was held in very high esteem. The abbey over which Whiting presided was one of the richest and most influential in England. About one hundred monks lived in the enclosed monastery, where the sons of the nobility and gentry were educated before going on to university.Richard Stanton, A Menology of England and Wales (Burns & Oates Ltd., London, 1892), p. 538 As Abbot of Glastonbury. Whiting was a peer of the realm and administrator of vast estates. Whiting signed his assent to the Act of Supremacy when it was first presented to him and his monks in 1534. Henry sent Richard Layton to examine Whiting and the other inhabitants of the abbey. He found all in good order, but suspended the abbot's jurisdiction over the town of Glastonbury. Small \\"injunctions\\" were given to him about the management of the abbey property. A number of times over the years which followed, Whiting was told the abbey was safe from dissolution. However, the 1535 Suppression of Religious Houses Act brought about the dissolution of the lesser monasteries and provided a warning of what the future might hold. Death By January 1539, Glastonbury was the only monastery left in Somerset. Abbot Whiting refused to surrender the abbey, which did not fall under the Act for the suppression of the lesser houses. On 19 September of that year the royal commissioners, Layton, Richard Pollard and Thomas Moyle, arrived there without warning on the orders of Thomas Cromwell, presumably to find faults and thus facilitate the abbey's closure. The commissioners had expected to find considerable treasure at Glastonbury and finding comparatively little, they proceeded to a more thorough search, finding money and plate walled up in secure vaults. There also was heard rumour of other items relocated to other estates and manors belonging to the Abbey. Whiting, by now feeble and advanced in years, was sent to the Tower of London so that Cromwell might examine him himself. The precise charge on which he was arrested, and subsequently executed, remains uncertain, though his case is usually referred to as one of treason. Cromwell clearly acted as judge and jury: in his manuscript Remembrances are the entries: Marillac, the French Ambassador, on 25 October wrote: \\"The Abbot of Glastonbury. . . has lately, been put in the Tower, because, in taking the Abbey treasures, valued at 200,000 crowns, they found a written book of arguments in behalf of queen Katherine.\\" As a member of the House of Lords, Whiting should have been attainted (condemned) by an Act of Parliament passed for that purpose, but his execution was an accomplished fact before Parliament met. Whiting was sent back to Glastonbury with Pollard and reached Wells, Somerset, on 14 November. There a trial apparently took place, and he was convicted of \\"robbing Glastonbury church\\". The next day, Saturday, 15 November, he was taken to Glastonbury with two of his monks, treasurer of the church John Thorne and sacristan Roger James, where all three were fastened upon hurdles and dragged by horses to the top of Glastonbury Tor which overlooks the town. Here they were hanged, drawn and quartered, with Whiting's head being fastened over the west gate of the now deserted abbey and his limbs exposed at Wells; Bath, Somerset; Ilchester; and Bridgwater.

William Alley (also Alleyn and Alleigh; 1510 ‚Äì 15 April 1570) was an Anglican prelate who was the Bishop of Exeter during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. Alley is known to the literary world by his Poor Man's Librarie, printed in folio by John Day, London, 1565, or Lectures upon the First Epistle of Saint Peter, red publiquely in the Cathedrall Church of Saint Paule, within the Citye of London, in 1560. Here are adioyned at the ende of euery special treatise, certain fruitful annotacions called miscellanea, because they do entreate of diverse and sundry matters.  Life  William Alley was a native of Wycombe, Bucks. He was educated at Eton College and finished his studies at the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. While a prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral, London, he was fixed on by Queen Elizabeth to succeed the deprived James Turberville. On 27 April 1560, she issued her cong√© d'√©lire to the Dean and Chapter. It was delivered to the president, Chancellor Levison, on 5 May. In the absence of the newly elected dean, Gregory Dodds, the election took place on 20 May and his consecration to the episcopate was held on 14 July that year.Matthew Parker's Register fol. 80. Exeter Cathedral, Alley's burial place The revenues of the see and of his chapter had of late been lamentably reduced. But the rectory of Honiton was given to the bishop towards the better maintenance of his rank; and in its parochial church, and even in the rectory- house, he held several ordinations \\"in Rectoria - in domo Domini Episcopi apud Honyton\\", as we learn from his registers. Owing to the impoverished state of the finances of his dean and chapter, with the unanimous consent of its members, and under the royal authority, he diminished the number of the canons of the cathedral from twenty-four to nine. His statute for this purpose is dated 22 February 1561. Attempts were made at subsequent periods to set aside this ordinance, which conferred the power and emoluments on the favoured nine, to the exclusion of the other fifteen. It proved useless, however, to combat a practice which had been legalised by time and authority. Richard Hooker, who knew the bishop well, commends his affability of manners, regularity of life, and singular learning. He added that, Later, however, in his History,p. 359 in describing the Mayor, Robert Midwynter, Hooker says that, After governing the diocese for about nine and a half years, he died, according to his epitaph, on 15 April 1570, aged 60, and was buried in the choir of his cathedral.

The site preserves the birthplace of American poet Walt Whitman. History The Whitman family's connection to Long Island dates back to the early 17th century and their property once covered 500 acres.Silverman, Francine. Long Island Alive. Edison, NJ: Hunter Publishing, 2008: 184. Walter Whitman Sr., father of the poet, built this farmhouse in West Hills near Huntington, New York in 1816. Whitman Sr. was a Quaker and a carpenter and he built the two- story, cedar-shingled farmhouse by hand.Schmidt, Shannon McKenna and Joni Rendon. Novel Destinations: Literary Landmarks from Jane Austen's Bath to Ernest Heminway's Key West. Washington, D.C.: National Geographic, 2008: 46. The future poet was born here three years later in 1819.Oliver, Charles M. Critical Companion to Walt Whitman: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work. New York: Facts on File, 2006: 350. The Whitman family's other three children were born here as well. When Walt Jr. was five years old, the family moved to Brooklyn. Whitman worked at various times as a printer, a schoolteacher, a journalist, a volunteer nurse during the Civil War, and a newspaper publisher. He returned to Long Island at age 17 to teach at a local school and founded the Long Islander newspaper. He eventually authored a book of poetry, Leaves of Grass, which sold poorly when first published but has over time come to be considered a masterpiece of world literature. The museum's web site says: \\"By the end of his life, Whitman had become the first American poet to achieve international acclaim. Today his poetry is available in every major language and inspires people world wide who find in Whitman the voice and vision of a truly international humanist.\\" Near the end of his life, he returned to the area and, as he reported, \\"rode around all the old familiar spots, viewing and pondering and dwelling long upon them, everything coming back to me from fifty years.\\" Lilacs which grew on the property inspired Whitman's poem \\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\\".Schmidt, Shannon McKenna and Joni Rendon.

It was designated a New York State Historic Site in 1957 and in 1985 was added to both the New York State Register and National Register of Historic Places. It is run in collaboration with the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. The site consists of three structures: The historic Birthplace which is maintained as the Museum, an interpretive center, and a gathering house used for exhibitions and meetings. The interpretive center includes displays of portraits, letters, and manuscripts and showcases Whitman's voice reading a few lines of his poem \\"America\\", originally recorded on an Edison wax cylinder. The site offers guided tours, exhibits, an audio-visual show, events, a poet-in-residence program, and an annual poetry contest for local grade school students. The museum has nineteenth century furnishings, 130 Whitman portraits, original manuscripts and letters, artifacts, Whitman's voice on tape, and his schoolmaster's desk. The museum is open every day June 15 through Labor Day except for major holidays. In the winter it is open Wednesday through Sunday. There is a museum gift shop. Tours for school classes and other large groups may be arranged in advance.

The group was known for its live performance art that was built around interactive games and workshops. The work was minimalist, structuralist, and conceptual.  Background  The performance group was formed in the early 1970s in London. It emerged out of a series of workshops, which were oriented towards games-based exercises. One of the earliest outcomes that shaped the direction of the Theater of Mistakes was a performance at Ascham Street in Kentish Town, which involved its residents as well as the environs of the location. The residents' furniture, for instance, was moved onto the streets for the exhibition. From then on, the group developed a form of structured performance art that included architecture, choreography, and poetry. The concept of the performance often included several elements. For example, it might open with a \\"Free Session\\" and continue with performance workshops on weekdays. Each Friday and Saturday evenings, the group performed one of its works such as Going (1977), which involved a cast of five playing out mannerisms of departure in five choreographed acts. While it received some attention in the United Kingdom, the Theater of Mistakes reached a higher level of acclaim abroad. One account stated that in Italy, a theatre manager doubled their fee due to the popularity of the performance.

Anthony Howell (born 1945) is an English poet, novelist and performance artist. He was a founder of the performance company The Theatre of Mistakes, in the 1970s and 1980s. Life and career Howell was born in 1945. By 1966 he was dancing with the Royal Ballet, but left the ballet in order to concentrate on writing, and his first collection of poems, Inside the Castle, was published by the Cresset Press in 1969. At that time (1968‚Äì69), he was teaching creative writing to students at the American Institute for Foreign Study at their University of Grenoble campus. In 1970 he directed The Oz Event at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) and read his poems at the Poetry Society.

During the Revolutionary War, New York's First Constitutional Convention met there and on April 20, 1777, adopted the first New York State Constitution. After one month, the Senate fled the British troops who were advancing from Manhattan. The Senate House and much of Kingston was burned in retribution. It has served as a museum from the late 19th century. Currently it is owned and operated by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. In 1971 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the first building in Kingston listed. At that time it was a contributing property to the small Clinton Avenue Historic District. Four years later, in 1975, the original district was replaced with the larger Kingston Stockade District, which retained the Senate House and all the other properties of the original district. The house first belonged to Wessel Wesselse Ten Broeck, born about 1636, who emigrated to New Amsterdam from Wessen, in Westphalia in 1659. It is generally described as having been built in 1676, but can be certainly dated to some time before his death in 1704.Helen Wilkinson Reynolds, Dutch Houses in the Hudson Valley Before 1776, Payson and Clarke Ltd. for the Holland Society of New York, 1929. Reprinted by Dover Publications Inc. 1965. pp. 219-221 The ground floor of the house consists of three rooms, lined up along the street, with an entrance hallway between two of the rooms. As is typical of early Dutch houses in the Hudson Valley, the house is of stone, with the exception of the rear wall which is brick, laid in Flemish bond. At the back is a kitchen wing, added early, but somewhat later than the original construction.

Winthrop was the son of physicist John Winthrop. He was wounded at the Battle of Bunker Hill. He was librarian of Harvard from 1772 until 1787. Biography James Winthrop was the son of physicist John Winthrop, Hollis professor of mathematics and natural philosophy, and his first wife Rebecca Townsend. His mother died when he was quite young. He graduated from Harvard College in 1769 and received a master's degree in 1772. He became Librarian of Harvard College and held that office nearly twice as long as that of any of his predecessors. From the vote by which the Library was given to his care, 1 May 1772, we learn that he had acted as substitute for William Mayhew for over two years. He did not, however, sign the formal agreement as Librarian until the following December. His salary was fixed at ¬£60 per annum. The next year he issued the second printed catalogue of the Library under the following title: Catalogus Librorum in Bibliotheca Cantabrigiensi selectus, frequentiorem in usum Harvardinatum qui Gradu Baccalaurei in Artibus nondum sunt donati. Bostoniae : Nov. Ang. Typis Edes & Gill. M,DCC,LXXIII. This catalogue of twenty-seven pages is an alphabetical list containing perhaps about a thousand titles. It aims to omit books \\"supra Captum Juniorum Studentium,\\" and, in general, books in foreign languages (excepting the classics) and medical and legal works. Two years later, when the College buildings were occupied by the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, it became necessary to remove the Library to a place of safety. The Provincial Congress voted, 15 June 1775, \\"that the Library apparatus and other valuables of Harvard College be removed as soon as may be to the town of Andover, that Mr. Samuel Phillips, Mr. Daniel Hopkins, and Dummer Jewett Esq. be a committee to consult with the Revd. the President, the Honble Mr. Winthrop', and the Librarian or such of them as may be conveniently obtained and with them to engage some suitable Person or persons in said town to transport, receive and take the charge of the above mentioned effects, that said Committee join with other gentlemen in employing proper persons in packing said Library apparatus and such other articles as they shall judge expedient and take all due care that it be done with the greatest safety and despatch.\\" The work of removal was begun at once. On the 17th, Samuel Phillips Jr., wrote \\" Amid all the terrors of battle I was so busily engaged in Harvard Library that I never even heard of the engagement (I mean the siege) until it was completed.\\" While the books were being thus packed up, Winthrop, who was an ardent patriot, was taking part in the Battle of Bunker Hill, where he received a wound in the neck. Among the receipts for moving the books is one \\" for carting one load of Books ... to the house of George Abbot, Esq. in Andover, 17 miles, ¬£0.17,\\" signed by John L. Abbot, the father of the Librarian of the same name. A subsequent vote of the Congress authorized the removal of some of the books to such other places besides Andover as might seem best. Many books had thus been taken to Concord, and there it was decided the following fall to open the College. The authority of the Provincial Congress for this and for the removal of the books to that town from Andover was obtained, and the Corporation voted, 24 October 1775, that the boxes of books be opened there for the use of the students \\"as soon as the Librarian can remove to Concord & attend to the duties of his office.\\" Although by the following June, the students had returned to Cambridge, it was May, 1778, before the whole of the Library was restored to the College halls. In the spring of 1775, Winthrop had been appointed postmaster at Cambridge ; but after six weeks he felt obliged to resign. In a letter (5 July 1775) to the president of the Provincial Congress, he says : \\"As the office will not furnish the single article of victuals, as the establishment is at present, I shall be constrained to quit the place of business and seek for a sustenance somewhere else. All the money I have received since the oath was administered on the 25th of May, amounts to ¬£7.7s.10d. ; 15 per cent, of it is my pay for six weeks, that is at [the rate] of 6 1/4d. a day nearly. Judge then, sir, whether this be sufficient to furnish one, who has no other support, with a sustenance.\\" At this time, Harvard's finances were at the lowest ebb, partly on account of the hard times occasioned by the war, and partly because the Treasurer, John Hancock, was too engrossed in public affairs to attend to the business of the College. Winthrop, for these reasons, was probably receiving no salary. In September, he was appointed register of probate, an office he held for forty-two years. Indeed, it was this position that led to his resignation from the Library in 1787; for the Harvard Corporation had passed a law (aimed directly at him) that no officer of the College should hold any civil or judicial office. He was appointed a justice of the court of common pleas in 1791, and served in that position until 1805. Winthrop died unmarried, 26 September 1821. By his will, he left his library to the then recently established Allegheny College, which a few years before had granted him an LL.D. James Winthrop was a scholar of ability both in science and languages. He was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780 and contributed a number of mathematical papers to the memoirs of the Academy. After his father's death he was a candidate for the Hollis professorship of mathematics. He later became interested in theology especially in prophecies and chronology, and on these topics he published a number of pamphlets. He was one of the original members of the Massachusetts Historical Society, but, although he took great interest in the society and was seldom absent from the meetings, does not appear to have contributed much to their publications.

He was the speculated author of the Letters of Agrippa (November 1787 - January 1788), which appeared in the Massachusetts Gazette.

Minnesota, 134 U.S. 418 (1890), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that procedural due process limits state regulatory power over railroad rates.. A regulatory agency in Minnesota had set railroad rates that the Minnesota Supreme Court had refused to overturn. When the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad appealed the case, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the rates were set without due process of law, specifically without an opportunity to challenge the equality and reasonableness of the charges. The Minnesota court had sanctioned rate-setting without any judicial hearing, requirement of notice or witnesses, \\"-in fact, nothing which has the semblance of due process of law\\".134 U.S. at 457. The court rejected the railroad's argument that the state's contract with the Minnesota railroad line, as it existed in prior state-chartered companies that the railroad later bought, remained in force against state law. Instead, they found that the state's right to regulate industry could not be forfeited except by an explicit declaration in law. However, this issue was subsumed by the court's broader decision regarding due process. Justice Bradley dissented from the decision, arguing that it practically overturned Munn v. Illinois and other railroad cases that left states to decide toll rates. He indicated that it was the province of the states to decide the policy question of railroad rates, and not that of the judiciary.

He never held the title \\"prime minister\\" as is commonly misconceived. Life Alizoti was born in Gjirokast√´r, back then Ottoman Empire in a powerful family. His great-grandfather was Alizot Pasha who had ruled for a very short time (1787) the Vilayet of Yannina after the death of Ahmet Kurt Pasha. His father Hasan Bey Alizoti was a local bey. At the age of 8, Alizoti was sent to study in Ioannina. After that he finished the Classic Gymnasium of Salonika in 1890 and return to Gjirokast√´r. After that he left for Istanbul, where he studied at Mekteb-i M√ºlkiye economics and civic administration. After the graduation he was sent in Syria where he worked as part of the Ottoman administration for 3 years. After succeeding the first assignment he was appointed Prefect of Homs in the Tripoli Eyalet, and later in the Bilecik province. In 1906 he wrote to the High Porte asking to be transferred somewhere in the Albanian areas. With the intervention of some friends of him in the capital, he was transferred as Prefect of Kor√ß√´. After the Young Turk Revolution and the new constitution he was sent Prefect in Prizren, Vilayet of Kosovo until March 1910 when the unrest in Albanian Vilayets would increase following with the Albanian rebellions. Alizoti was recalled to Istambul and sent to Romania for a specialization course. After 6 months he returned and started as Administrator of Urfa in Asia Minor, and after that as Governor of Al-Khums in Western Libya. According to Elsie, the Italians arrested him during the Italo-Turkish War for Libya and interned in a camp in Italy. There he would become one of the greatest Italophiles in Albanian history staying a loyal supporter of Italian interests. According to Albanian sources, he was recalled from the Ottoman authorities and sent as Administrator in the Dodecanese islands. After that, with the start of the Albanian Revolt of 1912, the Ottoman authorities sent him together with Abdyl Ypi as a best-fit \\"mediator\\" to calm down the Albanian rebels of the Lab√´ria region who had already gathered an Assembly in Cepo, near Gjirokast√´r, and aligned their demands with the rebels in the north. The attempts were unsuccessful even though Ypi and Alizoti managed to organize a meeting with rebel leaders in Tepelen√´ on August 18. Ismail Qemali wrote to Alizoti and asked to join him in Vlor√´ after the Declaration of Independence. For a short time in 1914 Alizoti was the 2nd Prime Minister under the auspices of the International Commission of Control. Under Prince Wied he served as secretary- general of the Ministry of the Interior, and Prefect of Shkodra, investigating Albanian officers who were suspected to had taken part in the Islamic Revolt. He strongly opposed Essad Toptani and his parallel government in Durr√´s. During World War I he worked with Austrian occupation forces as Financial Director of the Civilian Administration Council set up by August Ritter von Kral (1869-1953). Alizoti was Minister of Finances of Albania in 1918-1920\\\\. He was one of the prominent members of the Congress of Durr√´s. Later in 1920 he would take an opponent stance towards the Congress of Lushnj√´, which replaced the pro-Italian government of Durr√´s with a new one, establishing the territorial sovereignty of Albania. According to Sejfi Vllamasi's (1883‚Äì1975) memories, Alizoti, together with Mustafa Merlika-Kruja, Myfit Libohova, and Sami Bey Vrioni would try to prohibit the delegates for joining the Lushnje event. Ahmet Zogu would call him a \\"traitor\\" for that. After the attempts failed, Alizoti escaped shortly to Corfu avoiding any reaction from the congress supporters. During the June Revolution of 1924 he supported Ahmet Zogu, who needed him because of his good relations with the Italians. After Zogu's rise in power Alizoti took part in various negotiations between Albania and Italy, always siding with Italy to the detriment of Albanian interests, to the extent that he was called the \\"kavass of the Italians\\". From February to October 1927 he was Minister of Finance and shortly substituting his ally and friend Iliaz Vrioni. He played a major role in the proclamation of the Albanian Monarchy in 1928. Alizoti proposed that Zog was called not only \\"King of Albania\\" but \\"King of the Albanians\\" including so even the Albanian population outside the borders. During the Italian occupation he served again as Minister of Finances in Shefqet V√´rlaci's government from April 12, 1939 to 1940.

He was executed on 10 October 1947 by hanging. A special reference would be made during the communist era to one Alizoti's famous sayings regarding higher education (\\"...there is intellectual overproduction in Albania\\"), considering that 80-85% of the Albanians were illiterate.

Early life and education William Harris was born at Springfield, Massachusetts, April 29, 1765. His mother was Sarah, a granddaughter of Wm. Pynchon, the founder of Springfield, and his father Daniel was a deacon in the Congregational Church. Harris graduated from Harvard College in 1786, and he began as a minister, but soon retired due to health issues. He turned to the study of medicine and during that time converted to the Episcopalian Church. His health recovered and he rejoined the ministry. Academic career After rectoring in Marblehead, Massachusetts, he was made a deacon on October 16, 1791, in Trinity Church, New York, and advanced to the priesthood on the following Sunday in St. George's Chapel. On November 3 of that year he married Martha, the daughter of the Rev. Jonas Clark, of Lexington, Massachusetts. They had seven children. Harris continued to officiate both as teacher and preacher until 1801, when he received a unanimous call to St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery to fill the vacancy caused by the death of the Rev. Mr. Callahan. On February 2, 1802, he was inducted as rector. In 1811, Harris was elected president of Columbia College and received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from Harvard and Columbia. At the same time, Dr. John M. Mason, the prominent Presbyterian divine, who had been proposed for the presidency, was made provost, an office created for him and carrying with it some of the administrative duties. This lightening of the president's work enabled Harris to retain the rectorship of St. Mark's until 1816, when the resignation of Dr. Mason gave Harris all the duties of president.

Dr. Eschbach graduated from Jefferson Medical College in 1959. Eschbach was married to MaryAnn Eschbach for 51 years, they had 3 children; 5 grandchildren.  Anemia Research  When his mentor, Dr. Belding H. Scribner, challenged Dr. Eschbach, at the time a young nephrology researcher at the University of Washington, to find a way to correct the anemia in kidney dialysis patients, Dr. Eschbach accepted the challenge. Working with a hematologist, Dr. John W. Adamson, Eschbach looked at various forms of renal failure and the role a natural hormone, erythropoietin, had in preventing anemia. By studying the urine of sheep and other animals in the 1970s, the two scientists helped establish that erythropoietin did stimulate the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. In the 1980s, Dr. Eschbach helped lead a clinical trial at the Northwest Kidney Centers studying whether an artificial erythropoietin hormone, Epogen, manufactured by Amgen, could replace or supplement the naturally occurring hormone. The trial was successful, and its results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1987: Administering artificial erythropoietin did reverse anemia in kidney patients. His research helped to inform and lead to the Food and Drug Administration's 1989 approval of the replacement hormone Epogen. Epogen and its derivative Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents remain in use throughout the world.  Affiliations  Dr. Eschbach career at the University of Washington began in 1965, first as a clinical instructor, in 1975 Eschbach was named a clinical professor of nephrology. Eschbach worked as a senior research associate at the Northwest Kidney Centers in Seattle, and he served as chair of the Northwest Kidney Centers non-profit board of trustees 1985-1987. On September 26, 2007 the Northwest Kidney Centers based in Seattle, WA and Kirin-Amgen announced an honorary gift to the University of Washington Division of Nephrology to establish the Joseph W. Eschbach Endowed Chair in Kidney Research. \\"This is the greatest honor of my career,\\" said Dr. Eschbach in August 2007 upon learning of the endowed $1.5 million chair in his name. \\"I am particularly pleased that NKC and the UW have put emphasis on kidney research since the future well-being of our patients depends on research applied to their needs.\\"UW press release \\"NW Kidney Centers, Kirin- Amgen to establish endowed UW professorship in kidney research honoring beloved kidney physician -- the late Dr. Joseph W.

From 1965 to 1972 Eschbach served as Director of the NKC home hemodialysis program, the first home dialysis training center in the United States.Biographical Sketches of the NKF-K/DOQI Anemia Work Group Members  Awards  Eschbach was the recipient of David M. Hume Memorial Award, National Kidney Foundation (1995), and the Haviland Award of Excellence, Northwest Kidney Centers Foundation (1991).

His candidacy caused controversy at the time, because he ran for election against the wishes of the Dene chiefs. In response to him running for office he was deposed as President.

The Sibi Jataka is as hoary and sacred to the Buddhist, as an embodiment of 'Saranagata vatsala', as Sibi Chakravarti is to the Hindu, as a supreme symbol of 'Raja Dharma' which enjoins a king to protect the refugee even at the cost of his own life. It was a Buddhist Monastery later converted to an Hindu Shrine as per Historical evidences found.  Hinduism  Amvar chejarla temple Guntur District This is probably the only temple in the whole of India dedicated to Lord Siva as Kapotheswara. The deity is in Lingakara. Here Siva is represented as Kapotheswara, Lord Sibi who gave a portion of his own body in order to save a pigeon that took refuge with him. Curiously, in the imago of the Linga there are even today large cavities as if portions have been scooped or cut out, and these are said to be the places of the body, from which the Lord cut off his own flesh, in order to save the life of the Kapotha. The image is said to be the image of the 'Kalebara' of Sibi, with the head cut off, and on top of the Linga, there are still two large vertical cavities. One of these cavities helps to drain off the Abhisheka Tirtha to an unknown place and even today the smell of raw flesh and blood comes out of this since the God here is a very powerful one. The temple is of the greatest importance to us from the point of view of temple architecture. There are, as is well known, three types of temple architecture.  Apsidal Temple  The temple of Chezerla is a rare exception and this is a temple on the Apsidal model. This Apsidal plan and barrel vaulted structure, is classified in the VastuSastras, as 'Hasti prasta' or elephant back. These were originally Buddhist Chaityas and were readjusted for the purpose of Hindu worship, by the introduction of internal walls and upper store to seclude the Garbha Griha from the rest of the building. The end of the temple takes the form of an apse and in its centre is a white marble Linga. The fact that the temple is sacred to Buddhism and Hinduism and is built in a unique style, the temple must have come into existence, at a period of mutual tolerance between Hinduism and Buddhism. A famous inscription in the temple further supports this. A similar temple is the Trivikrama Temple at Ter, Maharashtra.  Governance  Chejerla gram panchayat is the local self-government of the village. It is divided into wards and each ward is represented by a ward member.  Education  As per the school information report for the academic year 2018‚Äì19, the village has a total of 3 Zilla Parishad/MPP schools.

Until recently it was considered to be a subspecies of Audubon's shearwater, but it is actually one of two members of a very ancient lineage of the small Puffinus species, the other being, as indicated by mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data, the Christmas shearwater. It is an endemic breeder of the Gal√°pagos Islands, and is largely sedentary, although individuals are commonly seen as far as the Oaxacan coast of Mexico. Description The Gal√°pagos shearwater has dark brown upperparts, undertail and underwing flight feathers, the rest of the underparts plumage being white. It sometimes has a dark collar. Both sexes are alike, as are the young after fledging. It is a slender-bodied shearwater, about 29‚Äì31 cm long, with a wingspan of around 63 cm and weighs 123-225 g. The species closely resembles the tropical shearwater, although the latter is typically blacker and has a longer tail.Onley, and Scofield, Albatrosses, Petrels and Shearwaters of the World (Helm 2007)  Behaviour The Gal√°pagos shearwater is a gregarious species and will feed at sea with other shearwaters and boobies.

Now set in state-owned parkland, it is where the first relatively complete set of dinosaur bones were discovered in 1838, and then fully excavated by William Parker Foulke in 1858. The dinosaur was later named Hadrosaurus foulkii by Joseph Leidy. The site, designated a National Historic Landmark in 1994, is now a small park known as \\"Hadrosaurus Park\\" and is accessed at the eastern end of Maple Avenue in northern Haddonfield. History William Parker Foulke, an attorney and amateur paleontologist affiliated with Philadelphia's Academy of Natural Sciences, was vacationing in Haddonfield in 1858, when he was alerted to the discovery in 1838 of large bones on the farm of Joseph Hopkins. Hopkins and farm workers had been quarrying marl when they uncovered bones resembling vertebrae. Foulke proceeded to direct a careful excavation in the area surrounding Hopkins' marl pit, turning the finds over to Dr. Joseph Leidy for analysis. Foulke unearthed 35 of an estimated 80 bones from the Hadrosaurus, which is believed to have been herbivorous, 7 meters in length, and weigh 2.5 tons. It lived during the Cretaceous period, 73 million years ago.Hadrosaurus foulkii, Academy of Natural Sciences. Retrieved February 24, 2012. Leidy published an analysis in 1865, and oversaw the creation of a reconstructed skeleton of the creature found in 1868. This reconstruction, put on public display at the Academy, brought the find a wider public audience. The site lingered in obscurity until 1984 when a local Boy Scout from Troop 65, Christopher Brees, as part of an Eagle Scout project researched the site and generated publicity, eventually leading to the species being designated the official dinosaur of New Jersey.

Mormon critics refer to the penalty as a \\"blood oath,\\" because it required the participant to swear never to reveal certain key symbols of the endowment ceremony, including the penalty itself, while symbolically enacting ways in which a person may be executed. The penalties were similar to oaths made as part of a particular rite of Freemasonry practiced in western New York at the time the endowment was developed. During the 20th century, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) gradually softened the graphic nature of the penalties and, in 1990, removed them altogether from its version of the ceremony. Original oaths On May 4, 1842, Joseph Smith instituted the endowment ritual in Nauvoo, Illinois. At three different stages of the endowment, participants were asked to take an oath of secrecy regarding the ceremony . The participants promised that ‚Äì rather than reveal the content of the ceremony ‚Äì they would suffer the following: *Stage 1 : \\"my throat ... be cut from ear to ear, and my tongue torn out by its roots;\\" *Stage 2 : \\"our breasts ... be torn open, our hearts and vitals torn out and given to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field;\\" *Stage 3 : \\"our body ... be cut asunder and all your bowels gush out.\\" each of the penalties accompanied by gestures known as the \\"execution of the penalty\\" which simulated the actions described in the oath . *Stage 1: The participant placed his or her right hand palm-down with the thumb extended and the tip of the thumb just under the left ear. The gesture was made by drawing the tip of the thumb swiftly across the throat until the thumb was just under the right ear then dropping the hand and arm quickly to the side of the participant's body. *Stage 2: The participant placed his or her hand in a cup form over the left breast. The gesture was made by pulling the hand swiftly across the breast then quickly dropping the hand and arm to the side of the participant's body. *Stage 3: The participant placed his or her right hand palm-down with the thumb extended and the tip of the thumb on the left of the torso just above the left hip. The gesture was made by drawing the thumb swiftly across the stomach until the thumb was just above the right hip and the hand and arm were quickly dropped to the side of the participant's body. The oaths and their accompanying gestures resembled certain oaths performed in a particular Freemasonry tradition in western New York at the time, in which participants promised: *Oath of an \\"Entered Apprentice Mason\\": \\"I will ‚Ä¶ never reveal any part or parts, art or arts, point or points of the secret arts and mysteries of ancient Freemasonry. . . binding myself under no less penalty than to have my throat cut across, my tongue torn out by the roots\\" . \\"This is given by drawing your right hand across your throat, the thumb next to your throat.\\" . *Oath of a \\"Fellow Craft Mason\\": \\"I ‚Ä¶ most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, that I will not give the degree of a Fellow Craft Mason to anyone of an inferior degree nor to any other being in the known world ‚Ä¶ binding myself under no less penalty than to have my left breast torn open and my heart and vitals taken from thence ‚Ä¶ to become a prey to the wild beasts of the field and vulture of the air\\" . \\"The sign is given by drawing your right hand-flat with the palm of it next to your breast across your breast from the left to the right side with some quickness and dropping it down by your side.\\" . *Oath of a \\"Master Mason\\": \\"I ‚Ä¶ most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear in addition to my former obligations that I will not give the degree of a Master Mason to any of an inferior degree nor to any other being in the known world ‚Ä¶ binding myself under no less penalty than to have my body severed in two in the midst and divided to the north and south, my bowels burnt to ashes\\" . \\"The Penal Sign is given by putting the right hand to the left side of the bowels, the hand open with the thumb next to the belly and drawing it across the belly and letting it fall; this is done tolerably quick. This alludes to the penalty of the obligation: 'Having my body severed in twain,' etc.\\" . Changes Beginning in 1919, LDS Church president Heber J. Grant appointed a committee charged with revising the endowment ceremony which was done under the direction of apostle George F. Richards from 1921 to 1927. Among the changes instituted was a modification of the oaths. While the gestures remained unchanged, the church clarified the verbal description of the oath with the phrase, \\"rather than do so, I would suffer my life to be taken.\\" Elimination In April 1990, the LDS Church eliminated the oaths and the gestures from the endowment. During the period when these oaths were used, there was no documented instance in which a person was killed or committed suicide for having violated the oaths of secrecy of the endowment. Confusion with other doctrines These penalty oaths and the oath of vengeance are often confused. The oath of vengeance‚Äîa promise to pray for justice for the murders of Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum‚Äîwas removed from the endowment in 1927 as part of the church's \\"Good Neighbor\\" policy, and the penalty oaths were removed in 1990. The penalty oaths are also frequently confused with the concept of blood atonement. Continuation by Mormon fundamentalists Some groups within the Mormon fundamentalist movement continue to practice the endowment without modification. These groups still participate in these oaths when performing the endowment. Some of the denominations that continue to perform the original endowment include the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, the Apostolic United Brethren, and the True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days.

He began his career in England with Chelsea before moving to the United States. In the U.S., he was a prolific goalscorer with the powerhouse Bethlehem Steel, Philadelphia Field Club and Fall River Marksmen clubs in the National Association Football League and American Soccer League. He was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1951. England Brittan began his professional career with English First Division club Chelsea during the 1913‚Äì1914 season. He saw time in only two games, scoring two goals. The next season, his playing time increased to only nine games in which he scored another two goals. When World War I began in 1914, Brittan was called into the British Army, serving three and a half years. In 1919, he rejoined Chelsea for the 1919‚Äì1920 season. He still saw limited playing time in only thirteen games, scoring only three goals. However, two of those came as game winners over Liverpool. Chelsea would not take a league double off Liverpool again until 2005. In March 1919, Chelsea loaned him to Leicester Fosse for two games. By the end of the 1919‚Äì1920 season, Brittan had become dissatisfied with both playing for Chelsea and life in England. Most of his family had moved to the U.S. where they settled in Philadelphia and Brittan decided to join them. When the management of top U.S. club Bethlehem Steel heard that he was coming to the U.S., they immediately signed him. United States=Bethlehem Steel Brittan signed with Bethlehem Steel of the National Association Football League (NAFBL) at the end of the 1919‚Äì1920 season, playing only one game, but scoring the lone goal, in a 1‚Äì0 victory over Brooklyn Robins Dry Dock. This was a significant goal in that Bethlehem won the league title by one point over Erie A.A.. Brittan found his form as Bethlehem's starting center forward at the beginning of the 1920-1921 NAFBL season. He not only scored at a prolific rate, but assisted on numerous goals. This led to interest in reacquiring Brittan on the part of Chelsea. The Pensioners reputedly offered Bethlehem up $15,000 for his contract. Bethlehem rebuffed Chelsea and Brittan led the Steel Men to a six-point margin of victory in the league standings. However, the NAFBL was declining by this time and in the summer of 1921, several of the league's stronger teams combined with other regional powerhouses to create the first American Soccer League (ASL). Philadelphia Field Club The creation of the ASL led to the brief disestablishment of the Bethlehem Steel team. Edgar and W. Luther Lewis, owners of Bethlehem Steel, decided to move the team to Philadelphia where it would compete under the name Philadelphia Field Club. The reasons for this move remain unknown but some suspect the two brothers wanted to capitalize on the greater population of Philadelphia to provide a financial base for their team. As a result, Brittan played the 1921-1922 ASL season with Philadelphia. Using the core of the old Bethlehem Steel team, Philadelphia easily won the league title. Brittan also won the league scoring title with 24 (some reports say 27) goals in 17 games. This was despite sitting out seven games over a two-month period after injuring his leg in December 1921. The Lewis brothers' ploy to increase revenue by relocating their team to Philadelphia failed and they were forced to sell several players to cover the team's debts. Fall River Marksmen In September 1922, Brittan signed with the Fall River Marksmen after the team's owner, Sam Mark purchased his contract from the Lewis brothers. When Brittan arrived in Fall River, he was also given coaching duties in addition to his playing responsibilities. Sam Mark was not disappointed with this move as Brittan would go on to score 135 goals in 168 league games between 1922 and 1926, with a brief return in 1927‚Äì1928. Building on Brittan's goal production and coaching, the Marksmen won the league title in 1924, 1925 and 1926. They also won the 1924 National Challenge Cup. New Bedford Whalers In August 1926, Fall River surprisingly released Brittan. He quickly signed with the New Bedford Whalers as a player-coach, but retired a few months later when the Whalers sold his contract to the Providence Clam Diggers. Apparently, Brittan had become a successful local businessman, owning an automobile dealership, and did not want to move to Providence. Fall River Marksmen In the Spring of 1927, Brittan decided to return to the field, this time back with the Fall River Marksmen. While the Marksmen finished third in the league, they won the 1927 National Challenge Cup, defeating Detroit Holley Carburetor F.C. by a score of 7‚Äì0. Brittan scored one goal in that victory. Brittan then played one last complete season with the Marksmen, scoring 16 goals in 28 games, giving him his team record 135 goals in 168 league games during two stints in Fall River. Team owner Brittan permanently retired after the 1927‚Äì28 season and devoted himself to his business interests. By 1931, the twin depredations of the Great Depression and the U.S. Soccer Wars had taken their tolls on the American Soccer League. Several teams were folding and others were relocating in attempts to maintain their financial solvency. Sam Mark had moved the Marksmen to New York City. In response, Brittan led a group of local businessmen who purchased the Providence Gold Bugs and moved the team to Fall River, renaming it Fall River F.C.. The team failed a few months later. This was Brittan's last foray into the sport which had played such a large part in his life. Brittan was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1951.

The pieces were composed in 1836 and published in 1837. Both nocturnes in this opus are dedicated to Countess d'Appony. This publication marked the transition from triplets of nocturnes to contrasting pairs. Whereas the Nocturnes, Op.9 and Op. 15 included three nocturnes each, the remainder of Chopin's nocturnes published during his lifetime were in sets of two. David Dubal feels that the pieces are \\"more aptly described as ballades in miniature\\". Blair Johnson states that these two nocturnes are \\"two of the most powerful‚Äîand famous‚Äînocturnes [Chopin] has ever penned\\" and that these nocturnes are \\"virtually unrecognizable\\" to the nocturne tradition of John Field.  Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1  The opening bars of No. 1 in C minor The Nocturne in C-sharp minor is initially marked larghetto and is in 4/4 meter, written as common time. It transitions to pi√π mosso (more movement) in measure 29, along with a time signature change to 3/4 meter. The piece returns to its original tempo and meter in measure 84, and ends in an adagio beginning in measure 99. The piece is 101 measures long and written in ternary form with coda; the primary theme is introduced, followed by a secondary theme and a repetition of the first. The opening alternates between major and minor and uses wide arpeggios, commonly found in other nocturnes as well, in the left hand; such arpeggios require a wide left hand to play smoothly. James Huneker commented that the piece is \\"a masterpiece\\",Huneker (1966), p. 259 pointing to the \\"morbid, persistent melody\\" of the left hand. The pi√π mosso uses mostly triplets in the left-hand and modulates to A-flat major in measure 49. It ends with a cadenza before transitioning back to the primary theme. For David Dubal, the pi√π mosso has a \\"restless, vehement power\\".Dubal (2004), p. 463 Huneker also likens the pi√π mosso to a work by Beethoven due to the agitated nature of this section. The coda \\"reminds the listener of Chopin's seemingly inexhaustible prodigality\\" according to Dubal while Huneker calls it a \\"surprising climax followed by sunshine\\" before returning to the opening theme. right  In theatre  The first duet of the ballet In the Night by Jerome Robbins (1970) was choreographed to this music.

It consists of two strophes, repeated in increasingly complex variations. The piece is 77 measures long. right ornamentation in No. 2 Blair Johnston calls the main cadence, near the end of the piece, \\"one of the most glorious moments in Chopin's entire output\\". Johnston also calls the piece \\"one of [Chopin's] most graceful essays in fioritura ornamental practices\\". Huneker states that the piece \\"really contains but one subject, and is a song of the sweet summer of two souls, for there is obviously meaning in the duality of voices.\\"Huneker (1966), p. 260 The piece contains a harmony of broken chords which is played with the left hand, a habit Chopin had when composing his nocturneshttps://en.chopin.nifc.pl/chopin/genre/detail/id/11, while the right hand plays the main melody, often with the addition of a second voice.

When introduced into service, these ships were the most powerful destroyers in the world. They remained formidable ships well into the Pacific War. History Construction of the advanced Fubuki-class destroyers was authorized as part of the Imperial Japanese Navy's expansion program from fiscal 1923, intended to give Japan a qualitative edge with the world's most modern ships.Fitzsimons, Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare p. 1040 The Fubuki class had performance that was a quantum leap over previous destroyer designs, so much so that they were designated . The large size, powerful engines, high speed, large radius of action and unprecedented armament gave these destroyers the firepower similar to many light cruisers in other navies. The Akatsuki sub-class was an improved version of the Fubuki, externally almost identical, but incorporating changes to her propulsion system.Peattie & Evans, Kaigun pages 221‚Äì222. Hibiki, built at the Maizuru Naval Arsenal in Osaka was the third in the ‚ÄúType III‚Äù improved series of Fubuki destroyers, incorporating a modified gun turret which could elevate her main battery of 12.7 cm/50 Type 3 naval guns to 75¬∞ as opposed to the original 40¬∞, thus giving the gun a nominal ability as an anti-aircraft weapon. Hibiki was laid down on 21 February 1930, launched on 16 June 1932 and commissioned on 31 March 1933. Operational history On completion, Hibiki along with her sister ships, , , and , were assigned to Destroyer Division 6. World War II At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hibiki was assigned to Destroyer Division 6 of Desron 1 of the IJN 1st Fleet, and had deployed from Mako Guard District to provide cover for Admiral Nobutake Kond≈ç‚Äôs Southern Force, escorting Japanese troopships for landing operations in the Malaya and the invasion of the Philippines, and continued to support operations throughout the Philippines to the end of March 1942. After repairs at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in April, Hibiki deployed from ≈åminato Guard District in support of the invasion of Kiska in the Aleutians campaign of May‚ÄìJune 1942. On 12 June, she was damaged at Kiska in an attack by United States Navy PBY Catalina flying boats, and was forced to return to ≈åminato at the end of the month. Repairs at Yokosuka lasted until October.Morison, Aleutians, Gilberts and Marshalls, June 1942 ‚Äì April 1944 From November 1942 through the end of April 1943, Hibiki served as an escort for aircraft carriers and in various missions between Yokosuka and Truk, except for the month of January 1943, which she spent in dry dock at Yokosuka.D‚ÄôAlbas, Death of a Navy: Japanese Naval Action in World War II From May 1943, Hibiki returned to northern waters, and was assigned to patrols off the coast of Hokkaid≈ç and the Chishima islands. Hibiki subsequently assisted in the evacuation of surviving Japanese forces from the Aleutians through August. After maintenance at Yokosuka in September, Hibiki was sent to Shanghai, from which she escorted a troop convoy to Truk and Rabaul. Through the end of November, she was assigned to escort of tanker convoys between Balikpapan, Singapore and Truk and as a high speed transport between Truk, Ponape and various islands in the Carolines. She rescued the survivors from the torpedoed tanker Terukawa Maru on 21 December. From the end of December to April 1944, Hibiki served as an escort for the aircraft carriers , , and in various missions in the western Pacific and Netherlands East Indies. She returned to Kure Naval Arsenal, for maintenance in April, during which additional anti-aircraft guns were fitted at the expense of one of her main gun turrets. During May and June 1944, Hibiki was assigned to escort of tanker convoys. On 14 May, she rescued the 125 survivors of her torpedoed sister ship . During the Battle of the Philippine Sea, Hibiki was assigned to the First Supply Force, and suffered minor damage and two crewmen killed in strafing attacks by Allied aircraft. In August, Hibiki escorted two convoys from Moji to Takao and Okinawa. In September, after departing from Takao with a convoy bound for Manila, Hibiki was torpedoed by the submarine ; the explosion almost severed her bow. She was withdrawn back to Yokosuka for extensive repairs. On 25 January 1945, Hibiki was reassigned to Destroyer Division 7 of the IJN 2nd Fleet, but was retained in Japanese home waters. She was then reassigned to the First Escort Fleet in May, and transferred to Kure Naval District, where she remained as a guard ship to the surrender of Japan. After the end of the war, she was demilitarized and used as a repatriation vessel, and was struck from the navy list on 5 October 1945. In Soviet service On 5 April 1947, Hibiki was turned over to the Soviet Union at Nakhodka as a prize of war, and placed in service with the Soviet Navy under the name Verniy ( \\"Faithful\\" ), after being rearmed with Soviet-made weapons (six 130 mm guns, seven 25 mm guns, four to six 12.7 mm machine guns, and six 533 mm torpedo tubes). She was placed in service with the Soviet Pacific Fleet based at Vladivostok on 7 July 1947. She was renamed again on 5 July 1948 as Dekabrist ( \\"Decembrist\\"). She stood at the piers almost a year, waiting for rearming, before being retired from active service and used as a floating barracks ship, until retirement from service on 20 February 1953 and transferred to the OMS resourcing fund. Eventually, she was used as target- practice somewhere in the 1970s, where she was finally sunk. The wreck of Hibiki lies close to Karamzina island near Vladivostok, 27 meters deep, and can be explored with diving gear.

It often was and is used by Westerners, originated in British caricatures and later also used in the United States, and not always in a flattering context ‚Äì on occasion it was used to imply that Russia is \\"big, brutal and clumsy\\" (see 19th-century cartoon below). History The bear image was, however, on various occasions (especially in the 20th century) also taken up by Russians themselves. Having the bear cub \\"Misha\\" as the mascot of the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games was evidently intended to counter the \\"big and brutal Russian Bear\\" image with a small, cuddly and smiling bear cub. In Russia associations with the image of the bear have received relatively mixed reactions. On one hand, Russians themselves appreciate the bear for its raw power and cunning, and bears are very often used as mascots or as a part of a design on a logo. On the other hand, the overuse of the image of the bear by foreigners visiting Russia prior to 20th century led to the image of bear being a sort of insider joke, postulating that \\"Russian streets are full of bears\\" as an example of factually inaccurate information about Russia. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, there was some support in the Russian Parliament for having a bear as the new Russian coat of arms ‚Äì with the proposers pointing out that \\"Russia is anyway identified in the world with the Bear\\" ‚Äì though eventually it was the Tsarist-era coat of arms of the double- headed eagle that was restored. Later, the bear was taken up as the symbol of the United Russia Party, which has dominated political life in Russia since the early 2000s. Coincidentally, the surname of Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian president elected in 2008, is the possessive adjective of –º–µ–¥–≤–µ–¥—å: i.e. his surname means \\"bear's\\". In his successful 1984 re-election campaign, Ronald Reagan used the bear motif in the famous \\"Bear in the woods\\" ad, which claimed that he recognized the existence of a Soviet threat, and that his opponent denied its existence.

Early life  Foort was born in December 1921 in New West Minster, British Columbia. In 1941, after spending his childhood as a fisherman and part-time high school student, he joined the Air Force as a wireless operator. When World War II ended, he attended the College of Victoria, where he finished his high school credits. He earned BASc and MASc degrees in Chemical Engineering at the University of Toronto, 1946 - 1951.  Career in prosthetics  After earning degrees in chemical engineering, James joined Colin McLaurin, an Air Force veteran and aeronautical engineer, and Fred Hampton, a leader in the field of prosthetics, at Sunnybrooke Veteran‚Äôs Hospital in Toronto in 1951, working for the department of Veteran‚Äôs affairs. With the culmination of World War II, veterans across the world were complaining about the quality of their artificial limbs: \\"There was clearly a coalescence of national need and emotions [..] which] translated into a political will and funded programs within leading federal agencies in both Canada and the US.\\"Hobson, A. Douglas, \\"Reflections on rehabilitation engineering history: Are there lessons to be learned?\\" Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development, Vol. 39 No. 6, November/December 2002, Supplement Pages, 17-22. At the Sunnybrooke Hospital in Toronto, James helped to develop a prosthetic foot that, unlike any previous models, had no moving parts and essentially functioned like a rocker. In addition, inspired by complaints from fishermen, he replaced the raw hide used to protect the prosthesis with a plastic material that was more suited to withstand various elements such as moisture. In 1953, James moved to the University of California, Berkeley, where, working with C.W. Radcliff, he helped to develop the quadrilateral socket by developing a jig fitting system for amputations above the knee. Unlike previous technology, these jigs held the correct position of the residual limb, therefore making fitting of the socket for the residual limb easier and more comfortable for amputees to walk. The work that James Foort did at Berkeley remains the basis of contemporary prosthetic alignment according to some in the field.Baird, C. James, Katherine Binder and Kevin Carroll. \\"Prosthetics and Patient Management: A Comprehensive Clinical Approach.\\" Chapter 9, Transfemoral Prosthetic Designs [on-line document] http://www.slackbooks.com/excerpts/46712/46712.asp In addition to developing the quadrilateral socket, the team at Berkeley systematized the prosthesis developed by Colin MacLaurin and Fred Hampton for total absence of the limb. The Berkeley team developed the PTB Below knee prosthesis for amputations below the knee. Using completely new technologies, the PTB prosthesis enabled the amputee to walk around with no corset or side joints. Not only did these new adaptations solve the problem of constriction of circulation and ease restriction on the thigh, but it allowed people to be amputated below the knee twice as was usual for amputations related to circulatory problems, thereby increasing their function. James returned to Canada in 1963, where living and working in Winnipeg, he developed a modular system of lower extremity prosthetics. This ‚Äòtinker toy‚Äô system, as he describes it, meant that instead of long delays in the process of making, adjusting, and replacing prosthetics, it could now be done extremely quickly because each of the parts could fit easily into one another. Everything had to be sculpted before. In 1971, James moved to Vancouver where, with a team of engineers, he developed a computer program to fit artificial limbs. The program provided a means of making the shape of the socket, which would then be used to program the machine that carved the shape. His modular ‚Äòtinker toy‚Äô system would then be used to put the prosthesis together. The computer system would later be known as CAD-CAM (computer aided design and manufacture).Childress, S. Dudley, \\"Presentation highlights: Computer-Aided Design and Manufacture (CAD-CAM).\\" Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development Vol. 39 No. 3, (Supplement) May/June 2002. VA/NIH Prosthetics Roundtable Pages 15-16. CAD-CAM was developed, and later improved, by prosthetics companies such as Bio-Sculptor. James Foort never attempted to patent any of his technological breakthroughs in pursuit of profit, which made the technology more affordable and easily accessible. In 2009 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science from Queen's University Ontario.  Personal life  Foort retired in December 1986 and latterly lived in Vancouver where he wrote an opera and spent his time doing art, writing, and urban farming. He died in April 2020 at the age of 98.James FOORT obituary  External links  * Personal Website References * Additional information was taken from an interview with James Foort, September 24, 2007.

The first primer in the Estonian language was published in 1575. The oldest university is the University of Tartu which was established by the Swedish king Gustav II Adolf in 1632. In 1919, university courses were first taught in the Estonian language. Today's education in Estonia is divided into general, vocational and hobby education. The education system is based on four levels which include the pre-school, basic, secondary and higher education. A wide network of schools and supporting educational institutions has been established. The Estonian educational system consists of state, municipal, public and private educational institutions. There are currently 589 schools in Estonia.List of schools in Estonia, Academic higher education in Estonia is divided into three levels: bachelor's studies, master's studies, and doctoral studies. In some specialties (basic medical studies, veterinary, pharmacy, dentistry, architect-engineer and a classroom teacher program) the Bachelors and Master's levels are integrated into one unit. Also bakalaureusekraad awarded before or on year 2002 are equivalent to the Master's level degrees awarded after implementing the Bologne Process on 1 September 2002. Estonian public universities have significantly more autonomy than applied higher education institutions. In addition to organizing the academic life of the university, universities can create new curricula, establish admission terms and conditions, approve the budget, approve the development plan, elect the rector and make restricted decisions in matters concerning assets.Implementation of Bologna Declaration in Estonia Estonia has a moderate number of public and private universities. The largest public universities are Tartu University, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn University, Estonian University of Life Sciences, Estonian Academy of Arts, Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre and the largest private university is the International University of Audentes. The Estonian Academy of Sciences is Estonia's national academy of science. The IT industry of Estonia in the late 1950s as the first computer centers were established in Tartu and Tallinn. Estonian specialists contributed in the development of software engineering standards for different ministries of the Soviet Union during the 1980s.A. Kalja, J. Pruuden, B. Tamm, E.

The main aim of the early stages education is to support the child's family through fostering the child's growth and development by taking into account their individuality. Facilities for the pre-school education are provided by the local authorities at the request of parents. Pre-school children's institutions follow state curricula that is specifically formulated for the purpose. Children who have passed the pre-school curriculum will be issued a certificate that records the child's development. The parents will submit this certificate to the school where the child will be enrolled. Basic Comprehensive education The basic compulsory educational system in Estonia is the nine-year comprehensive school (Estonian p√µhikool, \\"basic school\\"), for which school attendance is mandatory (homeschooling is allowed, but rare). Basic education serves as the mandatory minimum of general education requirement, which can be acquired either partially in primary schools (grades 1 to 6), basic schools (grades 1 to 9) or upper secondary schools that also teach basic school curricula. First three grades of primary school are called Algkool which can be translated as \\"beginning school\\" and can be confused with primary school. In some low density population areas Algkool is the only school available and students enter primary school in a bigger town. Basic education is made available through national curriculum of basic school or simplified curriculum for basic school. Graduating the basic school requires that the student learns the curriculum at least a satisfactory level together with passing three basic school graduation exams consisting of the Estonian language or Estonian as a second language, mathematics and an exam on a subject of the student's choice as well as completing a creative assignment. Following graduation from basic school, there are a number of possibilities for continuation of the educational path. There is a possibility to acquire general secondary education at upper secondary school, vocational secondary education at some vocational education institution or simply an occupation. Students‚Äô knowledge, skills and proficiency are usually assessed on a five-point scale where ¬´5¬ª is ¬´very good¬ª, ¬´4¬ª is ¬´good¬ª, ¬´3¬ª is ¬´satisfactory¬ª, ¬´2¬ª is ¬´poor¬ª and ¬´1¬ª is ¬´weak¬ª. Schools can use a different marking system and for classes 1 to 3 or 4 a descriptive marking system that does not use numbers. Secondary education Secondary education is based on basic education and divided into general secondary education, provided by upper secondary schools, and vocational secondary education, provided by vocational educational institutions. General secondary education constitutes a set of knowledge, skills and competences, set out in the national curriculum for upper secondary schools, the acquiring of which is the precondition for further studies at universities and vocational educational institutions. Upper secondary education is not mandatory. General secondary education is acquired at the gymnasium (in Estonian \\"g√ºmnaasium\\"), which is an upper secondary school. The upper secondary school is a general education school, which follows on from basic school and has a nominal study period of three years. Upper secondary schools consisting of years 1 to 12 (i.e. the study period lasts 12 years) have historically prevailed in Estonia. Everyday learning is based on school curricula prepared based on the national curriculum for upper secondary schools. Upper secondary schools are designed to help students become creative, multi-talented, socially mature and reliable citizens who have discovered a field of endeavor that is best suited to their individual interests and capacities for continuing their future educational path. The study programme at upper secondary school is arranged into mandatory and voluntary courses. Graduation from upper secondary school requires the student to complete a curriculum consisting of at least 96 individual courses passed at a satisfactory level as a minimum, passing the state exams consisting of the Estonian language or Estonian as a second language, mathematics and a foreign language exam, passing the upper secondary school exam as well as completing a student research paper or practical work during the entire study period. Attaining general secondary education entitles students to continue their studies at a higher educational institution or to obtain vocational education. Curricula The national curricula for basic and upper secondary schools The national curricula establish the standard for basic and general secondary education. The curricula are implemented in all basic and upper secondary schools of Estonia, regardless of the schools legal status, unless otherwise stipulated by the law. The curricula designed for basic and upper secondary schools are structured around subject groups. In upper secondary schools, the subjects are divided into courses. The minimum study load required for graduation must encompass at least 96 courses, which are divided between obligatory and optional courses. Subject specific curricula make provisions for opportunities for combining subject-specific and inter- disciplinary approaches through employing cross-curriculum topics and unified approaches to evaluation. International curricula According to the Basic Schools and Upper Secondary Schools Act, it is possible to conduct studies in Estonia by following the curriculum formulated under the aegis of either the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) or the Statute of the European Schools. In Estonia, the opportunity to study according to the IBO curricula is provided by the Tallinn English College, Miina H√§rma Upper Secondary School, Audentes private school and the International School of Estonia. The Statute of the European Schools serves as the charter for the operations of the Tallinn European School. Study based on the IBO curriculums is state sponsored in municipal schools, the Tallinn English College and Miina H√§rma upper secondary school, whereas in private schools it is the subject to the tuition fees. Financing According to the Basic Schools and Upper Secondary Schools Act the school's running costs will be covered by the school manager. In most cases, this means local governments. Local governments are authorised to establish, re-arrange and close general education schools. Local governments keep account of the number of compulsory attending children, ensure school attendance control, make arrangements for school transport and the provision of school meals and perform a number of related functions. The number of the students in municipal schools will be used to calculate the amount of state subsidies allocated from the state budget to municipalities. The state subsidy is used for covering expenses on teachers‚Äô salaries, social taxes, training and textbooks. Similar subsidies are also made available to private general education schools as prescribed by the Private Schools Act. In doing so, the state will refrain from prescribing guidelines as to the use of the funds allocated. The local government reserves the obligation and right to finance schools based on their actual needs.

Bradley of Frankfort, Kentucky, Brass Hat is trained by his son William \\"Buff\\" Bradley. Racing career After a successful three-year-old season in 2004, Brass Hat won once in two starts in 2005. In 2006 he won two of four starts. He set a new Gulfstream Park track record of 1:47.79 for 9 furlongs in the Grade I Donn Handicap. He finished second to Electrocutionist in the March 25th Dubai World Cup but was disqualified after a post-race test revealed trace amounts of the banned drug methyl prednisolone acetate. While owner Fred Bradley did not dispute the positive test, he asserted that the therapeutic medication given the horse 28 days prior to the World Cup was well within the guidelines put out by the Emirates Racing Association. The disqualification was upheld on appeal. In mid summer, Brass Hat suffered a sesamoid fracture that kept him out of racing for several months. Returning to the track in 2007, Brass Hat set another track record at Churchill Downs, winning an 8.5 furlong race in 1:41.27. He then finished eighth in the Whitney Handicap and sixth in the Woodward Stakes at Saratoga Race Course but returned to winning form in September when he captured the Massachusetts Handicap. He then finished eighth in the 2007 Fayette Stakes and second Clark Handicap. Returning to the track in 2008, the then seven-year-old gelding brought in a strong performance in the grade 1 Donn Handicap, a race that he had won two years before, finishing fourth. Then he headed to Fairgrounds, to race in the New Orleans Handicap, where he once again finished fourth. He also finished third in the Fifth Third Elkhorn Stakes, fourth in the Louisville Handicap, fifth in the Stephen Foster Handicap to two time Horse of the Year Curlin, eighth in the Dust Commander Stakes, and just recently, fifth in the grade 2 Muniz Handicap.

It was published by Bantam Books in 2005. Background The book is set on one continent in a world gradually recovering from a cataclysm known as the Time of Black Ice. More than seven centuries previously, this event dramatically transformed the geography of the land, reduced populations, and caused a dramatic shift in the balance of power between the different races inhabiting the continent, allowing humans to reach a position of dominance. The immediate cause of this catastrophe was a war between an Empire that covered most of the continent and barbarians from the Turca Wastes to the north. An army led by the Empress Cyrsa included warriors of such ability they could reach a state called jaedunto, allowing them to touch jaedun, the wild magic that flowed through everything. These were known as jaecai. When jaecai fought, especially against similarly powerful opponents, wild excess magic was released that had unpredictable and long- lasting effects on the site of the battle. The Turasynd Campaign created a maelstorm of wild magic that devastated the north, and destroyed both sides. Nothing was ever found of the Empress, nor forces from either side, all presumed consumed by the devastations. Years of magic storms followed, destroying much of the world. Before the Empress departed on her expedition, she divided the Empire into Nine Principalities for safekeeping. Among the long-term repercussions of the cataclysm, populations were reduced and settlements were wiped out or cut off from each other. The Nine Principalities became separate and distinct states, with some subdividing further in the wake of the chaos. Of the old institutions of the Empire, bureaucracy remained to provide order in the recovery process. Gradually, population increased, but at the time of the story, still below pre-Cataclysmic levels. As civilization returned slowly to normal, explorations were conducted to re-establish contacts between settlements, and to map out the world again. Plot summary Qiro Anturasi, Royal Cartographer of Nalenyr, had been instrumental for his family's reputation as the most reliable map-charter in the known world. Merchants and princes all sought his clan's maps, even as the House of Anturasi continued sending out expeditions to expand their wealth of information, surveying unmapped territories, making detail notes of fauna, flora and geography. The Anturasi had been vital to Nalenyr's growing wealth and rise in power. Considered a crucial state treasure that must not fall into the wrong hands, Qiro was confined, on orders and under protection of the Naleni princes, to his estate Anturasikun in Moriande, capital of Nalenyr. There, he continued to oversee his clan's map-making enterprise, training the scions of the clan into the family trade, ruthlessly subjecting them to rigorous training and demands, for more than half a century. Now, the family stood poised on the brink of a historical breakthrough event which could catapult their standing further and beyond the imagination of rival map- makers. Intertwined with their mission were the political ramifications for Nalenyr, the aggressive northern state of Deseiron, and Helosunde which served as buffer between the two former powers. Much of Helosunde had been under Desei occupation, and Nalenyr provided Helosundian refugees sanctuary and support to confound Desei designs on Nalenyr. Qiro's grandsons, Jorim and Keles, were tasked with undertakings that would take them in opposite directions. Jorim was to embark on a specially commissioned ship Stormwolf to make accurate longitudinal charts at sea with a secret new instrument. Keles was to tasked to rediscover the lost segment of the pre-Cataclysmic Spice Route, which would take him into ground zero of the Cataclysm, a region where the ancient wild magic still raged. Nirati, sister to Jorim and Keles, remained behind in Moriande to hold the fort, for stakes were high and there were many hidden players whose intrigues threatened her beloved brothers. Meanwhile, in the aftermath of the devastations caused by the wild magic, the jaecai who had not departed with Empress Cyrsa's expedition, continued the xidantzu tradition in their schools martial arts. Their best students became itinerant warriors who travelled the realms to help fight injustice without regard to political affiliations. Moraven Tolo was one such warrior. When hints to powerful cache of ancient weapons, imbued with magicks from their former wielders, came to his attention, the jaecais became concerned that opportunistic parties would see it as an easy means of raising a strong army without the necessary ability, discipline and experience to control the power, possibly leading to history repeating itself.

It was enacted partially in order to fulfil Malaysia's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, it retains the option of corporal punishment for child offenders. In December 2004, members of the legal community suggested that the law needed review, despite its newness, in order to clarify its criminal procedures. Alt URL One example of the Act's unclarity was brought to light in a 2007 case involving a 13-year-old convicted of murder. Under Section 97(1) of the Act, capital punishment may not be applied to children; Sections 97(2), 97(3), and 97(4) make provisions for alternative punishments for offences which would result in the death penalty if committed by adults, namely detention at the pleasure of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. However, Section 97(2) was overturned by the Court of Appeal in July 2007 on the grounds that it violated the Constitution of Malaysia's doctrine of separation of powers, leading to the situation that no punishment at all could be rendered. The Act was meant to give further protection to child offenders. There are, however, a number of shortcomings missing from the Act. Besides the uncertainty of detention period under Section 97, another omission is the maximum length of the remand order. For an adult offender, Section 117 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides for a maximum of 14 days remand. Section 84(2) of the Child Act simply allows the court to make a remand order without prescribing the maximum length of remand. This problem was subsequently remedied in a 2003 case which held that the Criminal Procedure Code would govern the remand period of a child. With regard to the trial procedure, an adult accused has the option to give a sworn evidence, unsworn evidence, or remain silent. The Child Act does not provide for any right to remain silent. Section 90(9) merely allows the child to give sworn or unsworn evidence. Additional protection The Act has provided extra protection for a child offender especially with regards to the privacy of the child. The trial for the Court for Children shall be in closed court (in camera). Only certain specified persons are allowed to attend the trial. There now a legal duty for the parents of the child to attend the trial. It also contains provisions to protect the child from associating with adult offenders in prison or elsewhere. Preamble Preamble of the Act provides the following recognitions and acknowledgements: #RECOGNIZING that the country‚Äôs vision of a fully developed nation is one where social justice and moral, ethical and spiritual developments are just as important as economic development in creating a civil Malaysian society which is united, progressive, peaceful, caring, just and humane #RECOGNIZING that a child is not only a crucial component of such a society but also the key to its survival, development and prosperity #ACKNOWLEDGING that a child, by reason of his physical, mental and emotional immaturity, is in need of special safeguards, care and assistance, after birth, to enable him to participate in and contribute positively towards the attainment of the ideals of a civil Malaysian society #RECOGNIZING every child is entitled to protection and assistance in all circumstances without regard to distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, social origin or physical, mental or emotional disabilities or any other status #ACKNOWLEDGING the family as the fundamental group in society which provides the natural environment for the growth, support and well-being of all its members, particularly children, so that they may develop in an environment of peace, happiness, love and understanding in order to attain the full confidence, dignity and worth of the human person #RECOGNIZING the role and responsibility of the family in society, that they be afforded the necessary assistance to enable them to fully assume their responsibilities as the source of care, support, rehabilitation and development of children in society Structure The Child Act 2001, in its current form (1 January 2006), consists of 15 Parts containing 135 sections and 2 schedules (including 1 amendment). * Part I: Preliminary * Part II: Co-ordinating Council for the Protection of Children * Part III: Appointment of Protector, etc. * Part IV: Courts for Children * Part V: Children in Need of Care and Protection ** Chapter 1: General ** Chapter 2: Temporary Custody and Medical Examination and Treatment ** Chapter 3: Offences in Relation to the Health and Welfare of Children ** Chapter 4: Notification on Taking a Child into Care, Custody or Control * Part VI: Children in Need of Protection and Rehabilitation ** Chapter 1: General ** Chapter 2: Offences * Part VII: Beyond Control * Part VIII: Trafficking in and Abduction of Children * Part IX: Institutions ** Chapter 1: Places of Safety and Places of Refuge ** Chapter 2: Places of Detention ** Chapter 3: Probation Hostels ** Chapter 4: Approved Schools ** Chapter 5: Henry Gurney Schools ** Chapter 6: Special Provisions in Relation to Places of Safety, Places of Refuge, Places of Detention, Probation Hostels, Approved Schools and Henry Gurney Schools ** Chapter 7: Miscellaneous * Part X: Criminal Procedure in Court for Children ** Chapter 1: Charge, Bail, etc. ** Chapter 2: Trials ** Chapter 3: Powers of the Court for Children at the Conclusion of Trial ** Chapter 4: Probation * Part XI: In the Care of Fit and Proper Person * Part XII: Contribution Orders * Part XIII: Miscellaneous, Arrest, Search, Seizure, etc. * Part XIV: Miscellaneous * Part XV: Savings and Transitional Provisions * Schedules First ScheduleSecond ScheduleSee also * Children Act ReferencesExternal links *Child Act 2001 Category:2001 in Malaysian law Category:Malaysian federal legislation Category:Child safety Category:Children's rights legislation ","title":"Child Act 2001"},{"id":"13428752","text":"Henri II of France issued the Edict of Compi√®gne on 24 July 1557. The Edict of Compi√®gne (), issued from his Ch√¢teau de Compi√®gneA second Edict of Compi√®gne issued from the same ch√¢teau in August 1765, in the name of Louis XV, aimed at a minor adjustment of the process of electing mayors. by Henry II of France, 24 July 1557, applied the death penalty for all convictions of relapsed and obstinate \\"sacramentarians\\",This meant Calvinists not Lutherans. for those who went to Geneva or published books there, for iconoclast blasphemers against images, and even for illegal preaching or participation in religious gatherings, whether public or private.Robert Jean Knecht, The Rise and Fall of Renaissance France: 1483-1610 (rev. ed., Blackwell, 2001:241. It was the third in a series of increasingly severe punishments for expressions of Protestantism in France, which had for an aim the extirpation of the Reformation.The first punitive code, the Edict of Fontainebleau (1540), had been issued in 1540. The second, more severe, was the Edict of Ch√¢teaubriant of 1551. The Edict of √âcouen was issued in 1559, the year of the king's death. By raising the stakes, which now literally became matters of life and death, the Edict had the result of precipitating the long religious crisis in France and hastening the onset of armed civil war between armies mustered on the basis of religion, the series of French Wars of Religion, which were not settled until Henri IV's edict of toleration, the Edict of Nantes (1598). The source of the \\"contagion\\", as court pamphleteers put it, was Geneva, where the French-born John Calvin achieved undisputed religious supremacy in 1555, the same year that the French Reformed Church organized itself at a synod in Paris, not far from the royal residence at the Louvre. At the Peace of Augsburg signed that same year in Germany, the essential concept was cuius regio eius religio, \\"Whose region, his religion\\". In other words, the religion of the king or other ruler would be the religion of the people. The petty princes of Germany were enabled to dictate the religion of their subjects, and it came to be sensed as a mark of weakness that the King of France could not do so: \\"One King, One Faith\\" would become the rallying cry of the ultra- Catholic party of the Guise faction. The Parlement de Paris was deeply divided on the issues. When the King approached the Parlement for its formal advice beforehand on the best means of punishing and stamping out heresy, the moderate voices of pr√©sident S√©guier and conseiller du Drac urged against the proposed new edict (as unnecessary) and specifically opposed the introduction of an Inquisition into France, an innovation that would appear to circumvent the king's justice, vested in the parlement.Roelker 1996:229f. The preamble of the Edict of Compi√®gne, like earlier ones, remarked on the ineffectiveness of the courts in acting against \\"heretics\\", because of the malice or lenience of judges. The Edict sanctioned a papal brief that established a court of Inquisition in France, though the Parlement delayed in acting upon it, and it was rescinded in April 1558.Knecht 2001:240f. For now it hesitated even to take up the edict: \\"On the last day of 1557, the gens du roi complained again that the court had still not deliberated the king's latest edict (Compi√®gne), \\"presented four months ago.\\" They understated the case: the edict had been presented on July 24, 1557, and was registered in January 1558.\\"Roelker 1996:230. But the first effects of the Edict had already transpired. On 4 September 1557 an angry mob had broken into a Calvinist meeting being held in a private house in the rue Saint-Jacques. They found nobles and royal officials, respected artisans, women and children. About 132 people were arrested and thrown into prison. On 14 September, three, including a noble widow, were publicly burned in the place Maubert.Knecht 2001:241.

Fox, an apprentice coach builder from the Falls Road in Belfast, Northern Ireland, joined the IRA in 1969 aged eighteen. He explained his motivation for joining the IRA in a 1998 interview with the Irish News, stating: \\"I was almost shot in a gun attack at Norfolk Street. I came away wanting a gun. It was survival. You wanted to protect your own people ... my family and myself. When the barricades went up I wanted a gun so I approached this fella who was in the IRA and asked for gun and he said: could I shoot a British soldier? At that time I hadn't the idea that it was the British government's fault.\\" In 1981, Fox, serving a twelve-year sentence in the Maze Prison for possession of explosives and bombing a hotel, joined the hunger strike on 24 August, replacing Paddy Quinn who was taken off the strike by his family. Fox ended his strike after 32 days without food on 24 September after doctors warned him he would be dead within days due to an obstructed kidney. As a result of his IRA activities, Fox was imprisoned on four occasions and spent over twenty years in prison,Ed Moloney states 19 years, Suzanne Breen states 22 years, and Fox himself states he spent nearly 22 years in prison. before being released in 1998 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement resulting from the Northern Ireland peace process. At Easter 2001, Fox was a speaker at the commemoration to mark the 85th anniversary of the Easter Rising in Dublin, saying \\"after spending nearly 22 years in jail, one of the questions I'm most frequently asked is 'was it worth it'? I can't answer that question. History will answer that. The question is phrased in the past tense. It's not over. The struggle continues and will continue until the British are out of Ireland\\". In 2005 Fox joined the IRA's Army Council replacing Brian Keenan who resigned due to ill-health. Fox resigned in September 2006 after accusing Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness of \\"undemocratically\\" controlling the organisation, and later became involved with √âir√≠g√≠. In January 2007, Fox was returning from a family holiday when he was detained for questioning at Belfast International Airport by two men who identified themselves as members of the British security agency MI5, according to Fox's solicitors. Fox made a formal complaint regarding his treatment to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, a body set up under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 to investigate complaints against MI5 and other law enforcement agencies.

Individuals must maintain active membership each year through payment of dues to continue to receive benefits. Though direct involvement with a chapter is optional, members also may join community-based networking groups via KDP Global to extend their support system and mentoring community. History Kappa Delta Pi was founded in 1911 at the University of Illinois in order to foster excellence in education and promote fellowship among those dedicated to teaching. In 1912, a petition to merge Kappa Delta Pi and Phi Delta Kappa (PDK) was declined by the latter because PDK could not agree to the terms that women be allowed in an \\"honor fraternity\\". In 1920, William Chandler Bagley installed a Kappa Delta Pi chapter at Teachers College, Columbia University. Four years later (1924) American pragmatist philosopher and educationalist John Dewey was inducted as the first member of the Society's Laureate Chapter (see below). The Society's flagship publication, The Educational Forum, was first published in 1936. Organization and governance=Organization Among the more than 625 chapters around the world are institutional chapters affiliated with teacher education programs, including community colleges and virtual universities. Led by students and faculty, these chapters provide local members with networking, leadership, service, and professional development programming. In addition to individual programs and events provided through individual chapters, all members can participate in professional development located on the Kappa Delta Pi website, which includes webinars and KDP Global. Alumni/professional chapters and affiliate chapters, organized in school districts or cities, offer members opportunities to participate in educational and service activities and to grow through professional development. The Society headquarters is responsible for the daily operations of the Society. The headquarters staff maintains membership and financial records, and provides support and assistance to institutional, alumni/professional, and affiliate chapters and members. Headquarters offices are located in Indianapolis, Indiana. The Kappa Delta Pi Educational Foundation solicits contributions to fund educational programs for the Society and its members. Since 1980, the Foundation has awarded more than $1 million for programs, grants, and scholarships. Members of KDP serve as Kappa Delta Pi Educational Foundation trustees to oversee policies and governance. Governance The Society is led by the Executive Council, which consists of nine elected members who are responsible for the vision, direction, fiscal security, and general oversight of the association. The Executive Council also appoints chairs and members of national committees. Biennially, the legislative body of the Society convenes to determine policy for the organization, including changes to the bylaws. Voting delegates elected by chapters represent their local voice and opinions at the Convocation. Publications The Teacher Advocate, published quarterly, offers novice and apprentice teachers connections and support through practice-oriented articles and expert-advice columns. The Kappa Delta Pi Record, published quarterly, presents practical articles on compelling topics and issues important to practicing educators who teach at all levels and in a wide range of disciplines in classrooms and other educational settings.

GlobalCustodian.com refers to the website of Global Custodian magazine, which provides daily news and events coverage of the securities services industry, particularly custodian banks, but also including fund administration, securities financing/lending, private equity, derivatives and other related topics. Published six times per year, Global Custodian magazine provides analysis and commentary on the latest news and events taking place in the international securities industry. The magazine is defined by a series of annual surveys that have become benchmarks for the industry. The magazine is the sister publication of PLANSPONSOR, planadvisor, aiTrade, and aiCIO.  History  Founded in 1989 by Dominic Hobson and Charles Ruffel, the original focus of the magazine was on securities processing operations: articles that explore how shares trade and settle and are held. Its editorial scope has since expanded to include fund administration, securities lending and financing, prime brokerage and the infrastructure of the global securities industry (Central Securities Depositories or CSDs, International Central Securities Depositories or ICSDs, payments systems and other industry bodies and initiatives). The editorial content of the magazine is now also supported by industry-standard surveys that address how the performance of custodian banks, fund administrators, prime brokers and tri-party securities financing providers compare with each other and within individual markets.

It is sung by guitarist Keith Richards. Credited to the writing team of Mick Jagger and Richards, \\"All About You\\" is solely the work of Richards. The song is a slow bittersweet ballad that has been interpreted as a final comment on the Anita Pallenberg romance that began in 1967 and ended in 1979 when Richards met his future wife model Patti Hansen. Richards' lyrics and singing express mixed feelings of attachment and revulsion; however, the song may also be interpreted as an early sign of the fracturing relationship between Richards and Jagger, the longtime leaders of the band. Richards had \\"cleaned up\\" after his 1977 Toronto heroin bust and wanted to take more responsibility back from Jagger. The lead singer and businessman had kept the band rolling through the worst period of Richards' excesses in the 70s, and in several interviews, Richards stated he immediately encountered resistance from Jagger regarding his new interest in taking some of the front man's burden.\\"Keith Richards ‚Äì Interview\\". Rolling Stone (magazine) November 12, 1981. Richards said in 2002, \\"I went through a very tough thing in the early '80s with Mick. So you get some songs like 'All About You,' to name just one. There's more on some of the Expensive Winos records.\\" Saxophonist Bobby Keys said of the song, \\"It had a little bit of sentimental input there about his feelings for Mick at the time. Just listen to the lyrics\\". In the song, Richards bemoans a relationship he's in with harsh lyrics: On the writing, Richards said, \\"That song was hanging around for three years. After researching to make sure it wasn't somebody else who wrote it, I finally decided that it must have been me\\". Recording took place between January and February 1979 during the earliest recordings made for Emotional Rescue. A sign of his closeness to the song, Richards performs bass, piano, electric guitar, and backing vocals with Ronnie Wood. Keys performs the song's distinctive saxophone and Charlie Watts performs drums. An early take with an unfinished vocal track has recently surfaced on bootleg, and an embryonic instrumental from the Some Girls sessions, called \\"Train Song\\" is reported to exist. \\"All About You\\" was performed by Richards during the 1997-1998 Bridges to Babylon Tour and the 1999 No Security Tour.

Information about his life and scientific and creative activities can be found in the works by Taj ad-Din Subki (Tabakat Ash-Shafii'yya Al-kubra), Khatiba Baghdad (Tarikh Baghdad), Ibn Hajara AshkAlani (Lisan Al-Miyzan), Sulami (Tabaqat As-Sufiyya) and in a number of other treatises. He received criticism from other traditionalists, however al- Dhahabi defended him, saying, \\"He is a leader in Hadith\\". Al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi speaks about his life in his book Bad'u Shaani Abu Abdullah (\\"The Beginning of Abu Abdullah's Pursuit\\"), published in Beirut in 1965 by Yakh'ya Ismail Usman, together with the work of the scientist in Khatm Al-Avliya (\\"Seal of the Saints\\"). Life Tirmidhi was apparently born between 820 and 825 AD in Termez, Khorasan, nowadays Uzbekistan. His father was a scholar of hadith and a jurist; his early education appears to have been very orthodox. He was reared as a scholar of hadith and fiqh (law), more specifically, the Hanafi school of law that was dominant in eastern territories of Iran. The range of Tirmidhi's education did include the sciences, such as Greek natural science and philosophy. His subsequent reference to learning the use of the astrolabe, implying a knowledge of astronomy and mathematics, has been given different interpretations. \\"There is no trace of influence from 'natural science' in his writings.\\" But being a Sufi Master is enough to accept that he did. His works touch on Kalam and Aqeedah, and he entered into rational disputation with the Mutakillimun of his era, and maintained a critical attitude of them.Ubaydulla Uvatovning ‚ÄúIkki buyuk donishmand‚Äù (¬´Sharq¬ª NMAK, Toshkent, 2005) His works, containing a variety of content, cannot be considered entirely in the category of mystical works, or in the category of hadith sciences, nor in the category of philosophical works, or in the category of kalam or jurisprudence. However, his general pursuit of knowledge gained him the name of \\"al-hakim\\".  Early years  Different dates are used in written sources and present literature to indicate al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi's date of birth and death. Some authors, Khwaja Khalif in particular, in his Kashf as-Zunun, give the year 255 in Hijra / 869 AD as Al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi's date of death. The same date was written on Al- Hakim al-Tirmidhi's tomb. If we proceed from the fact that Al-Hakim al- Tirmidhi lived more than one hundred years, some sources say 112, 116 or 120 years, he was born approximately between 750‚Äì760 AD. At the same time, Abdulfattah Abdullah Baraka who wrote his great \\"Al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi and Nazariyyatukhu fil\\" (\\"Al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi and his theory\\") thirty years ago, said that Al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi, was born in 205 in Hijri / 820 and died in 320 in Hijri / 932 and lived 112 years. Muslim Hadith scholars report that there is a difference of opinion over his birth and death, but that he died around 280 H, having lived for 70 to 80 years. Detailed information about Al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi's childhood and youth is not available in the sources. According to his \\"autobiography\\", he started learning religious sciences when he was eight, and he made a Hajj to Mecca when he was twenty-eight.  Later life  Returning from Mecca, Al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi became a Sufi follower; he withdrew from people and learned treaties. His father Ali bin Hassan was a leading scholar, a Hadith specialist, who, looking for knowledge, went to Baghdad and took an active part in scientific discussions with prominent scholars of the time on various problems of Hadith. His mother and uncle were considered to be experts of Hadith. Consequently, Al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi grew up in the circle of educated and scientific people, which influenced greatly on his ideology. Some written sources contain reliable information about Al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi's teachers. His teacher was his father Ali bin Al-Hassan at Tirmidhi \\"History of Baghdad\\" by Khatib Al-Bagdhadi contains some information. Among his other teachers were Kutaiba bin Sayid as-Sakafi Al-Balkhi (798‚Äì888 AD), Salih bin Abdullah al-Tirmidhi of much interesting facts had been written in the book \\"Books about Famous People\\" by Ibn Khibbana; Salih bin Muhammad al-Tirmidhi who was former qazi of Termiz for some time, Sufyan bin Vaki (died in 860), Hassan bin Umar bin Shafiq Al-Balkhi (died in 840 AD), Ahmad bin Khadravayh (died in 854 AD), Abu Turab An-Nakhshabi (link), and Yahya bin Maaz Ar-Razi (died in 875 AD). Based on data given in the written sources Al-Hakim al- Tirmidhi's life can be divided into the following periods: *The first period includes al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi's childhood up to seven. Unfortunately we do not have exact information about this part of his life. But nevertheless, one can say that unlike the children of his age he displayed ability at this age to various games, as if he prepared himself to the future scientific life, he worked hard with his teachers, obtained knowledge on various sciences (particularly on theology) and got ready to mystic spiritual life. *The second period embraces Al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi's life from eight to twenty eight, when he received knowledge from different teachers (sheikhs). For knowledge he visited other oriental cities, was in Mecca and made a pilgrimage. Some sources pointed to the fact that he paid much attention to learning Hadith and problems of fiqh in this period of his life. *The third period of his life is related to learning the Qur'an thoroughly. He assimilated by deep God's words, their essence, fasting, praying and pious deeds and so on. The philosophic mystic work by Al-Antahi \\"Healing of Hearts\\" had a great influence on him. Al- Hakim al-Tirmidhi had many of students, including: Abu Muhammad Yahya bin Mansur Al-Kadi (died in 960 AD), Abu Ali Mansur bin Abdullah bin Khalid Al- Zuhli Al Hiravi; Abu Ali Al-Hassan bin Ali Al-Jurjani. He also taught Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Isa, Abu Bakr Muhammad Ibn Umar Al-Al Hakim Al-Varrak, Muhammad bin Jaafar bin Muhammad bin Al-Haisam bin Umran bin Buraida, and others. Al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi's scientific and creative activity is closely connected with his travels to other countries and cities. He visited Balkh, Nishapur, and Baghdad, where science and culture reached its zenith, and he met famous scholars and took part in discussions. Nevertheless, Termiz, his native city played an important role in his scientific and creative activity, and there he created his basic works. His sermons and as well as some works, first of all, Hatam Al-Avliya (Seal of Saints), Hal Ash-Shari'a (Arguments of the Islamic Law) in which are discussed Muslim rituals, about \\"love for God\\" and about various categories of mystics, about \\"the Seals of Saints\\", along with existing \\"Seals of Prophets\\", had dissatisfied some parts of the falikh and rich. Escaping from his enemies' chase, Al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi had to move to Balkh and then to Nishapur, where he was very well accepted and where he obtained a large number of followers later. Works According to Radtke and O'Kane, \\"he is the first and, up until the time of Ibn al-Arabi, the only mystic author whose writings present a broad synthesis of mystic experience, anthropology, cosmology and Islamic theology... Tirmidhi's system of thought is representative of an old Islamic theosophy which had not yet consciously assimilated elements from the Aristotelian-Neoplatonic philosophic tradition.\\"Radtke and O'Kane, The Concept of Sainthood in Early Islamic Mysticism (Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press, 1996). He had 62 editions and 108 titles. His works can be divided into six parts: Tafsir (Quranic exegesis), Hadith (prophetic Tradition), Fiqh (jurisprudence), Arabic terminology, anthropology, and the theory of sainthood. Some of his works are: * Nawadir al-usul fi ma'rifat ahadith al-rasul (\\"The unique principles that emerge from the knowledge of the traditions of the Messenger‚Äù), a collection of rare hadith, it consists of 391 chapter. * Ghawr al-umur (\\"The depth of things‚Äù) * al-Manhiyyat (\\"The religious prohibitions‚Äù) * al-Akyas (\\"The wise ones‚Äù) * Al- amtal min al-Kitab wa-l-Sunna (\\"The book of parables drawn from the Quran and Sunna‚Äù) *al-Furuq wa-man al-taraduf (\\"Terminological variations and the impossibility of synonymy in Arabic‚Äù) * Khaqiyqat Al-Odamiyya (\\"Book about the Nature of a Man\\") * Adab an-Nafs (\\"Bringing up the Soul\\"). *al-Radd 'ala l-mu'attila (\\"The reply to him who denies God‚Äôs attributes\\") *Khatm al-awliya' (\\"The path of the saints\\") *Kitab as-Salat va Makasidiha (A Book about Prayer and its Aims) *Kitab Al-Hajj va Asrarihi (A Book about Pilgrimage and its Secrets) *Al-Ihtiyatat (\\"The book of Precautions\\") *Kitab Al-Jumal Al-Lazim Ma'rifitiha (A Book about Sentences that Should be Known) *Tahsil naza'ir al- Qur'an (\\"Polysemy in the Qur'an‚Äù) *al-'Aql wa-l-hawa (\\"Intellect and passion as opposites‚Äù) * Kitab al-Tawhid (\\"Book of Monotheism\\") *Kitab al-Masayil al- Maknuna (\\"Book of the Hidden Issues\\") *Jawab Kitab Uthman ibn Sa'id min ar- Rayy.

Death  He qualified 6th during his first practice session for the Grote Prijs van Zandvoort, the Dutch round of the 1980 European F2 Championship. Towards the end of the second practice session, he had a minor crash in the chicane and went back to the pits. Even though the mechanics repaired the broken suspension and changed the nose of the car, he could not test his Tiga F280 BMW until the warm-up session on Sunday 20 July 1980. During his first two laps, he circulated slowly around the track to control the suspension. He took his 3rd lap at full speed. On the following lap, he went off the track, on the left side at the Scheivlak bend, at about 200 km/h. He crashed head-on into the guardrail and hit his head on the fence-pole.

It stars Rahul Bose, Raima Sen and Moushumi Chatterjee, and Japanese actress Chigusa Takaku in the title role. It is in English, Bengali and Japanese. The film was originally scheduled for release in October 2008, but the release was delayed until 9 April 2010. The story revolves around a young Bengali village school teacher (Rahul Bose) marrying his Japanese pen friend (Chigusa Takaku) over letters and remaining true and loyal to her throughout his life, while actually never meeting her.  Plot  Snehamoy Chatterjee (Rahul Bose) and Miyage (Chigusa Takaku) are pen pal friends who develop a deep and emotional relationship. Eventually, the pair exchange wedding vows through letters. Seventeen years pass but they never meet, yet the bond of marriage is strong between them. This unusual relationship is tested when a young widow, Sandhya (Raima Sen), comes to stay with Snehmoy along with her eight-year-old son Poltu. Snehmoy and the little boy bond and the arithmetic teacher discovers the joy of palpable bonds and fatherhood. He also develops an inexplicable thread of understanding with Sandhya too. Despite this Snehmoy remains loyal to his unseen Japanese wife. When Miyage is diagnosed with cancer and falls ill, Snehmoy takes a long leave of absence from his school and tries to find a cure for her illness. Snehmoy sets out one day during a storm to talk to the closest oncologist in Calcutta, but leaves upon realization that without Miyage physically being there, the doctor can do little. The storm turns violent, with harsh wind and rain. Snehmoy stops to call Miyage, and the exposure to the cold causes him to catch pneumonia when he returns to his house. Due to the continuing storm, no villagers are able to travel to Gosaba by boat to obtain the antibiotics required to cure his infection, and he dies some days later. After the sea calms down, Miyage, who is dressed in a white sari and has a shaved head (a tradition of Hindu widows) visits the house of her late husband. Sandhya welcomes her.  Cast  *Rahul Bose as Snehamoy Chatterjee *Raima Sen as Sandhya *Chigusa Takaku as Miyage *Moushumi Chatterjee as Maashi *Rudranil Ghosh as Fatik *Kunal Basu: Special appearance Production The production of the film started in April 2007. This is the first time Aparna Sen has made a film based on someone else's story. This movie is based on the title story of The Japanese Wife and Other Stories by Bengali Indian author Kunal Basu, who writes from Oxford and is an engineer by training. This film was earlier titled as The Kite, but later changed to the name of the original story title. The shooting locations are Kolkata and Sundarbans in Bengal and the Japanese cities of Yokohama and Tsukuba, Ibaraki. Casting Aparna Sen had seen Rahul Bose's work in English, August and Split Wide Open and felt that he was a good, controlled and intelligent actor. In an interview Aparna states that her choice of him for three of her films in a row is because she \\"can deconstruct him completely and mould him differently in any which way I can. Few actors have this kind of malleability\\". Aparna Sen's daughter Konkona Sen Sharma was the first choice for the role now played by Raima Sen. For her role, her name is not mentioned in the original short story, but Aparna Sen named her \\"Sandhya\\". Aparna told the Hindustan Times that \\"Raima as Sandhya shared perfect onscreen chemistry with Rahul. Both are shy and refined and suited the characters well\\". For casting Chigusa Takaku in the title role, Aparna said \\"We had hired an agency and chose her after auditioning 12 girls. She is a sensitive woman and an intuitive actress. Hence, she got a feel of the character quickly enough. She didn‚Äôt know any English. We had to converse with her through her translator who was always on the sets.\\" Reception=Critical reception Director Aparna Sen at a The Japanese Wife (2010) promotional event. The film received positive to very positive reviews from critics in India. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times Of India rated the film 4 out of 5 stars, and gave it an excellent review saying that, \\"There is such beauty, restraint and minimalism in this akin-to-a-haiku film, it transports you into another world altogether.\\" She praised the acting of all the lead actors, saying \\"Rahul Bose is in stellar form with his village boy look and his Bangla Angrezi. Raima Sen is delectable as the reticent, shy widow and Moushumi Chatterjee is a revelation.\\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and gave a good review and praised the acting and direction, saying that, \\"Despite its leisurely pace and its wildly implausible premise, populated with believable, flesh-and-blood characters who have real fears and anxieties that you can connect with.\\" Anupama Chopra of NDTV rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and praised the acting, but criticized the pace of the film, saying \\"How much you enjoy Aparna Sen‚Äôs The Japanese Wife is directly proportionate to how patient you are. The film is slow to the point of being painful. And yet, if you stay with it, The Japanese Wife is a rewarding experience. It‚Äôs rich with yearning and sadness and yet hopeful, in a quiet way.\\" Omar Qureshi of Zoom rated the film 5 out of 5 stars and called it \\"zoombastic\\". Box office The Japanese Wife had a decent opening with a 44% theatre occupancy. Released on only 32 prints, the film had an 88% initial collection according to Saregama Films. Home media In order to combat piracy, The Japanese Wife DVD was released in India only a month after the film's theatrical premiere. Despite this safeguard, the film was pirated soon after cinematic release and was sold online before the film's producers were able to file an injunction against the company. It was purchased by Databazaar Media Ventures for distribution in North America where it was released through Netflix, Amazon.com and iTunes on 13 July 2010. In the United Kingdom, the film was shown on Channel 4, on 25 April 2011.

The Noongar peoples know the plant as kotyeningara. It is an upright shrub with glistening and perfumed flower heads that appear between October and February. The small compact and erect flowers have been noted for their beauty. Although it occurs in areas near Perth, Morrison featherflower is not classed as rare or endangered because it still occurs in large populations, although its numbers have undoubtedly been reduced as a result of urban development.  Description  Verticordia nitens is a shrub which usually grows to a height of between although it will sometimes reach a height of , especially in the Gingin area. It will sometimes spread to a width of from upper parts of its solitary basal stem. Unlike some others in the genus, it does not possess a lignotuber. Plants have slender branches, corymb-like in the upper parts. The leaves are needle-like, but soft and long. The flowers are scented and arranged corymb- like on the ends of the branches, each flower on a stalk long. The flowers vary in colour from bright golden, to orange and to a lemon yellow colour in the taller plants of the Gingin area. The floral cup is top-shaped, about long and glabrous. The sepals are spreading, long, and have 7 to 8 feathery lobes. The petals are erect, egg-shaped to almost round, about long, with a toothed margin. The style is about long, glabrous and initially bent but straightens as the flower opens.

Taxonomy and naming The first formal description of this species was by John Lindley in 1837. The description was published in W. J. Hooker's Companion to the Botanical Magazine from a dried specimen that Lindley had received. Lindley gave it the name Chrysorhoe nitens. The type specimen for this species was first collected in the 1830s somewhere around the Swan River, Western Australia \\"by (?) Toward.\\" Lindley recognised its similarity to Verticordia but raised the new genus, noting differences between the two genera. In 1838, Stephan Endlicher changed its name to Verticordia nitida and published the change in Stirpium Australasicarum Herbarii Hugeliani Decades Tres although this is regarded as an orthographical variant and the name Verticordia nitens (Lindl.) Endl. is widely accepted. Schauer made a similar change of genus in 1841, apparently unaware that Endlicher had already published. Lindley apparently did not agree with the change to Verticordia, recording in his 1840 book, A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony - \\"by Dr. Endlicher it is reduced to the genus Verticordia, but I think the character assigned to it in the work alluded to is sufficient to define the genus.\\" When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991, he revived Lindley's epithet and placed this species in subgenus Chrysoma, section Chrysorhoe along with V. aurea and V. patens. Verticordi aurea has larger flowers and broader staminodes, and V. patens has lemon-yellow flowers, lobed staminodes, a much shorter style and an earlier flowering period. Distribution Verticordia nitens occurs as far north as Moore River, and as far south as Yarloop in the Avon Wheatbelt and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions although it does not reach as far as Harvey. The urban sprawl around Perth has created disjunct populations to its north and south. It grows in sand, usually in Banksia woodland and often occurs with Nuytsia floribunda, the Western Australian Christmas Tree, both species having flowers of a \\"brilliant orange colour\\". Ecology Verticordia nitens and V. aurea are not attractive to typical insect pollinators. Instead, they are pollinated by oligolectic species of solitary bee. In the case of V. nitens, the bee is Euryglossa morrisonii (also known as Euhesma morrisonii) of family Colletidae, which feeds on nectar, pollen, and the oil retained on the anthers of this species. The species is not considered to be threatened by extinction as it is common and populations are large. Naturally occurring plants have been heavily targeted for the cut flower industry, intermittent reports from 1993 record trends upward of 250,000 stems per annum, but the plant recovers well after harvesting. These later figures show a reduction after closer scrutiny of harvests, though much was obtained from private land, leading to increased sustainability when combined with greater care by pickers. V. nitens' records in the early 1980s were 83 000 bunches, the majority of the 2 000,000 verticordia stems in an annual harvest that sometimes permanently damaged the shrubs. Collection from Crown Land has remained permissible, with industry self-regulating its harvesters, but this may destroy local populations on reserves where this has occurred; the reduction in seeds in the soil can expose these populations to an inability to recover from bushfire in time to sustain its pollinator. The shrub is listed for it susceptibility to Phytophthora cinnamomi, and as an 'indicator species' it is used to detect its presence in banksia woodland, though without observations of its ability to recover. List of Susceptible Species Cultivation Plate 1 from John Lindley's A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony: \\"Chrysorhoe nitens\\" The plant was regarded as highly desirable by gardeners in England. The spectacular display, \\"strikingly beautiful\\", was expected to be marketable, yet it has presented difficulties in its propagation. It was introduced to English gardens in 1840, but was not known to have flowered until 1861. The introduction to the eastern states of Australia has met with some success, due to the refining of the technique of propagation and the application of early pruning. Heavy pruning was first suggested by James Drummond, an early collector and promoter of the region's flora. The species was mentioned in the early survey, A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony (Edwards's Botanical Register, 1837), which was referred to an 1861 notice in Curtis's Botanical Magazine by W J Hooker, quoting Lindley, > \\"'the magnificent Chrysorrho√´ nitens, whose yellow flowers, of metallic > lustre, form masses of golden stars some feet in diameter.' Ever since, it > has been the desire of nurserymen and others engaged in horticulture, to > import this lovely plant; ‚Ä¶\\" In these, they note the failure of early attempts to propagate the species in England, the seeds sent from the Swan River Colony mostly failed to germinate, or the plant did not reach maturity. The Veitch Nurseries successfully raised a plant, providing the flowering specimen in August for the illustration by Walter Fitch, but a note in Hortus Veitchii (1906) records the disappointing results and as \\"apparently lost to British gardens\\".George 2002, cites op. cit. and Hooker, William Jackson. \\"Stove and Greenhouse Plants\\" Curtis's Botanical Magazine. Vol. 87. 1861 Whether this species was amongst those grown from seeds supplied to Europe in the nineteenth century is lacking evidence and detail. Later cultivation techniques made use of cuttings from lower parts of the plant, propagated from soft to semi-hardened wood, to produce longer living specimens. Cuttings taken between autumn to spring strike readily. Seedlings produced in cultivated gardens are rare, due to the absence of its pollinator. The need for study and development of cultivation techniques was identified by Alf Gray in 1966, and suggested this was not beyond regular commercial interests. Early attempts showed poor development in root structure, and susceptibility to fungal diseases present barriers to development as a crop or garden plant. The species has been less successful as an introduction to the eastern states, suffering fungal conditions after rains and remains vulnerable to root rotting‚Äîattributed to Phytophthora‚Äîin dryer conditions that spare other plants. All members of V. sect. Chrysorhoe are noted for the vulnerability to infection of the rapid growth of soft wood, but this is especially destructive to V. nitens in cultivation. Controls include pruning below sites of infestation, which often appear near the growing tip, results in bushier and more resilient plants for gardens, and study groups have trialled the removal of flowers after downpours. White oil controls used on other verticordia are damaging to V. nitens. Techniques for cultivation for the cut flower industry, replacing the natural harvest, require further development for commercial viability. Cultural use The plant has traditional names Kodjeningara and Kotyeningara, and common names such as Glistening Verticordia or those deriving from Morrison‚Äîlater extended to similar species‚Äîthese include Morrison Featherflower, Morrison-flower, and Orange or Yellow Morrison. The name of early collector, William Morrison from Kew, was attached to V. nitens, and \\"Morrison flower\\" was extended to the common name for many similar and well known species. Morrison was asked by Seymour Meares, the son of Richard Goldsmith Meares, as the botanist Drummond was unavailable to him.> Meares' request from James Mangles was to deliver material for the cultivation of \\"Chrysorhoe nitens\\" in England, and unable to recall this name he applied that of the collector as a label. Until this fact was noticed by the historian Rica Erickson, the common name was presumed to commemorate Alexander Morrison, the government botanist at the colony.Berndt 2002, cit. Erickson, R. The Drummonds of Hawthornden Besides the 1861 illustration by Fitch, V. nitens was included in Constance Miller's collection of watercolours, The Western Australian Floral Birthday Book 1912, Emily Pelloe painted a portrait of the species in 1925, and full colour photograph was printed in Gardner's West Australian Wildflowers, 1935, the earliest impression of this work. Besides the illustration given to every taxon's description in Elizabeth George's book on the genus by Margaret Pieroni, this species was selected with the 200 plants she painted for Discovering Wildflowers of Western Australia in 1983. Verticordia nitens is commonly dried or preserved, with uses in a variety of arts and crafts, their exquisite arrangement of flowers and leaves being set in resin, as topiary trees, or decoration of cake. Flowering stems are readily available and easily preserved as pressed specimens, and these also appear in decorative applications. In addition to widespread use in flower arranging, they are used locally as a \\"Western Australian Christmas\\" decoration. Cuttings of the flowers retain colour and perfume, for up to 12 months, and this is one of few Verticordia species that can be hung and dried immediately, without a period in water. Another technique applied to V. nitens involves steeping cuttings in glycerine and hot water before drying, this affects colour but avoids flowers and leaves becoming brittle. They probably comprise the greatest part of Verticordia exported by the state's cut flower industry.

Possibly the most identifiable Border tartan garment of the region is the maud, made popular from the 1820s by fashionable Border Scots such as Sir Walter Scott, James Hogg, Henry Scott RiddellMoffat, A. (2015). Scotland: A history from the earliest times. Edinburgh: Birlinn. and Robert Burns. The modern Border tartan is a crossweave of small dark and light checks, much plainer than the better-known Scottish tartans. Traditionally, the yarn for the light squares was simply untreated sheep's wool and the darker yarn was the same wool dyed with simple vegetable dyes, such as alder bark or water flag, or the untreated wool of a black sheep. James Hogg painted with a Border plaid over his left shoulder Modern Border Tartans are almost invariably a bold black and white check, but historically the light squares were the yellowish colour of untreated wool, with the dark squares any of a range of dark greys, blues, greens or browns; hence the alternative name of \\"Border drab\\". At a distance the checks blend together making the fabric ideal camouflage for stalking game. This style of tartan is one of the oldest in existence as fragments of similar tartans have been found in Great Britain and Jutland. One similar fragment was discovered in an earthenware pot filled with silver coins, at the Antonine Wall in Falkirk, Scotland. This fragment, known as the Falkirk tartan or Falkirk sett, is currently the earliest check or tartan fragment found in the British Isles and dates back to Roman Britain times (around the 3rd century AD). It is now kept in the National Museum of Scotland. The Celts were said by Roman scholars to wear bright stripes, which some have suggested are actually descriptions of the brighter variants of tartan. Another similar tartan was found on a cloak in the peat bog at Thorsberg, in the modern-day Schleswig-Holstein region of northern Germany.J. P. Wild Britannia, Vol. 33, 2002 (2002)J. P. Wild, The Classical Quarterly, New Series, Vol. 14, No. 2 (Nov., 1964) In Anglo-Saxon England, though check was commonly used, its use in Schleswig is thought to have been greater (even as far as being used for tunics, unlike in England where tunics were usually plain hues, with cloaks and trousers being the most common check garments), suggesting that the continental Germanic peoples of the area used the design to an even greater extent than those in England.Anglo-Saxon Thegn, 449‚Äì1066 A.D. By Mark Harrison, Osprey Publishing 1993, . page 17 Border tartan is possibly the easiest tartan to create due to its use of natural colours and undyed wool. From this general check pattern came the Houndstooth variant, first developed in Lowland Scotland.Dunbar, John Telfer: The Costume of Scotland, London: Batsford, 1984, , 1984 (paperback 1989, ) This check is now famous for being used as the design for traditional chefs' trousers, in which the pattern helps to hide minor stains.https://www.webcitation.org/5ko4G7rHP?url=http://www.geocities.com/napavalley/6454/history_uniform.html October 2009+02:31:55 Popular culture Sir Walter Scott was famed for wearing trousers of Border tartan, thus starting a fashion for checked clothing in Victorian London. In Sketches by Boz, a collection of short pieces published by Charles Dickens, \\"The Shepherds' Plaid\\" is mentioned. The Border tartan has long been worn by the retainers of the House of Percy. In 1760, it was adopted as the official tartan of the Duke of Northumberland's piper. It is also the official plaid for pipers of the Northumberland Fusiliers and is nowadays commonly worn by Northumbrian pipers in general.

Depictions of portions of Asia have existed on maps as early as the 6th century BCE, with maps being drafted to depict the Babylonian, Hellenistic Greek, and Han dynasty empires. During the Middle Ages, Muslim geographers drew maps with more accurate depictions of Southern, Western, and Central Asia, and European maps began to more frequently represent Asia's landmass. Chinese geography from this period includes more detailed portrayals of the Indian Ocean, Arabian Peninsula, and East Africa. European maps of Asia would become much more accurate during the European Age of Discovery, starting in the 15th century.

The town is situated on the Peak Downs Highway south-west of Mackay. In the , Walkerston had a population of 3,403 people.  Geography  Walkerston is bounded by the Pioneer River to the north. The Peak Downs Highway enters the locality from Alexandra in the east, passes through the town (which is in south-west of the locality and then heads south-west exiting the locality to Greenmount. The town is situated on the Peak Downs Highway south-west of Mackay. Walkerston straddles Bakers Creek for about . Palms is a neighbourhood within Walkerston, located to the east of the town (). History In May 1860, Scots-born John Mackay was only 21 years old when he left Armidale, New South Wales in January 1860 with men, horses and provisions in search of land for cattle runs in north Queensland. They travelled up the east coast, taking a mainly inland route until they came to the junction of Cattle Creek and the Pioneer River, in an area about 15 miles west of present-day Walkerston. They then followed the river, firstly named by Mackay‚Äôs companions as the Mackay River but now known as the Pioneer River. This town was commonly known as Scrubby Creek from as early as 1866, and sometimes as Baker‚Äôs Creek; later these two names were interchangeable with Walkerston and, to a lesser degree, Alsatia. Scrubby Creek was definitely not a nickname for Walkerston; there were no inverted commas included when the words were printed in newspapers or almanacs. The name was well deserved, for the wild bush scrub grew luxuriantly on the banks of Baker‚Äôs Creek. Walkerston Provisional School opened on November 1874 but closed soon after due to low student numbers. It reopened but then closed on 31 March 1880 with the students transferred to the Alsatia State School which opened on 21 April 1880. About 1891 the school was renamed Walkerston State School. When the Queensland Surveyor-General combined the two former townships of Walkerston and Alsaia in 1881, he chose to name the combined town Walkerston. John Walker was the lessee of the Homebush pastoral run since 31 May 1866. The Pioneer Valley railway reached Walkerston from Paget on 10 August 1885. Whilst there was a station building, there was no passenger platform, passengers accessing the trains from the ground. St John's Catholic Primary School was established on 29 January 1924 by the Sisters of Mercy to provide Catholic education to both children of the town and the largely Maltese farming community. A boarding school was introduced to cater for students further along the Pioneer Valley, an arrangement that continued until 1976. The first lay principal was appointed in 1982 but the Sisters continued to be associated with the school until 1996. The Polynesian Provisional School opened on 1933 but closed that same year. The Walkerston public library opened in 1977. At the , Walkerston had a population of 2,563. In the 2011 census, Walkerston had a population of 3,089 people. In the , Walkerston had a population of 3,403 people.  Amenities  The town has two primary schools, a post office, three bars (including a sports club), and a supermarket. The Mackay Regional Council operates a library in Dutton Street.  Education  Walkerston State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Dutton Street ().

Meanwhile, in Stars Hollow, Luke chastises Lorelai for her wardrobe choice. Later Ian, a man Lorelai met that morning at Chilton, comes by the Inn to ask her to dinner, but she declines because he is a \\"Chilton Dad.\\" At the end of the day, Lorelai picks Rory up from Chilton with coffee in hand, and they commiserate about their bad days.

Water sourcing issues  Ice Mountain has been part of the Great Lakes water use debate in which diversion of the basin's primary and secondary water for export has been controversial. In 2004, a Michigan court ordered pumping of Sanctuary springs to cease. After an appellate court overturned the cease and desist order, the company and local groups came to an agreement to pump only per minute, which is comparable to other local beverage operations. Nestl√© has run into similar local opposition when trying to locate a new source location near the headwaters of the White River in the upper lower peninsula of Michigan. In 2017, Nestle applied for permits to increase production to 400 gallons (US) per minute. In end of 2019 a new second level ruling arrived telling that a first level ruling was on error when declaring bottled water to be part of the public supply.https://eu.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/12/03/nestle-ice- mountain-bottled-water-osceola-court-of-appeals-zoning/2598332001/ External links * Ice Mountain website  References  Category:Bottled water brands Category:Nestl√© brands ","title":"Ice Mountain (water)"},{"id":"13429148","text":"Moorad Choudhry was formerly Head of Business Treasury, Global Banking and Markets at Royal Bank of Scotland.

Currently the state has of state-maintained roadways, including of Interstate Highways and of State Highways. All of the U.S. Routes in Tennessee have a state route routed concurrently with them, though the state route is hidden and only signed along the green mile marker signs that display mileage within each county. Since 1983, state routes have been divided into primary and secondary routes. Description State routes in Tennessee are divided into primary and secondary routes, the former being part of the federal-aid primary highway system, and the latter part of the federal-aid secondary highway system. Most routes with primary designations also have secondary designations; very few state routes in Tennessee have only primary designations. Secondary segments of dual-designated routes are often considered primary routes, however. State routes in Tennessee do not follow a systematic numbering system unlike the U.S. Highway System and some other states' highway systems. However, routes with similar numberings, especially short secondary routes, tend to be located within close proximity to each other. Mile markers for state routes in Tennessee are based on the mileage for each county, and not the entire route. The route's number is displayed in small text at the bottom of each mile marker. State routes that are overlaid on U.S. Routes are not signed; the route numbers are only displayed on the mile markers. TDOT maintains these routes under the \\"State Highways\\" title of state law, but designates them as \\"state routes\\". The inverted triangle marker design was the only design until November 1983, when Tennessee divided its routes into primary routes and secondary or \\"arterial\\" routes with the adoption of a functional classification system, creating a primary marker and making the triangle marker the secondary marker; primary marker signs were posted in 1984.

The aim was to introduce different notable works of art found in museums around the world, mostly paintings, but also including sculptures. The human subjects in these artworks were re- interpreted as elephants. Plot summary As the elephants in Celesteville took to motoring, the city's train station lost its original purpose. Queen Celeste decided to convert the station into an Art museum to showcase all the artworks she and Babar had collected over the years. When the museum was opened, the adult elephants patiently explained to the young elephants different perspectives on art appreciation. Trivia The conversion of the Celesteville's obsolete train station into a museum of art in the story is inspired by the conversion of Gare d'Orsay (Paris, France) to the now famous Mus√©e d'Orsay. The design of the station in the story bears striking resemblance to the actual Gare d'Orsay, including the large clock at the facade of the station. In real life, the cause of obsolescence of Gare d'Orsay was its platforms became too short as longer trains came into service. Gare d'Orsay had been built in 1900 to serve as terminus for the Chemin de Fer de Paris √† Orl√©ans (Paris-Orl√©ans Railway). It ceased to cater to long-distance rail traffic in 1939 and served only suburban rail services. The decision to convert it to a museum was announced in 1977. Listed as a historical monument in 1978, it re-opened as Mus√©e d'Orsay in 1986. A number of artworks featured in the story were inspired by actual artworks found in Mus√©e d'Orsay.

The film suffers from limp direction, un- moving performances, and a wobbly script. Plot John Kinsdale is a NATO computer specialist living with his wife and two children in Naples, Italy. Trying to find a new housekeeper, she calls the number on an ad in the domestics section of a local English-language newspaper. When Kinsdale arrives home from work, he finds his family brutally murdered with the perpetrators nowhere in sight. The sudden tragedy nearly drives him to suicide, but upon seeing a television report on the deaths he instead resolves to avenge his family's murder. After the funeral, Kinsdale is visited by Police Inspector Lupo, is coordinating investigation efforts with the U.S. State Department. Lupo tells Kinsdale that hair strands at the crime scene identify the suspect as a redheaded male, between the ages of 25 and 45. Kinsdale steals U.S. Embassy credentials from Lupo, before meeting with his colleagues Janice Tilman and Mike McAllister. With McAllister, he runs the suspect's description and the analytics of their hair sample through a NATO database, and finds two possible suspects; Americans Andrew Taylor, who has disappeared, and Eddy Fonseca. Kinsdale tracks down Fonseca to the Pompeian ruins, but quickly rules him out when it becomes apparent he's just a tourist. Another American family is killed under similar circumstances, so Kinsdale travels to the crime scene using his stolen credentials, where he meets an Embassy worker named George Edmonds. After a few drinks at a local bar, Edmonds discloses the President received a letter several weeks ago demanding the release of a group of political prisoners and $10 million, or every three days an American family living in Italy will be murdered. The first two deadlines have already passed, with the third fast approaching. Meanwhile, Lupo is briefed by a CIA agent about the suspected perpetrators behind the murders; Taylor and known terrorist Kamal Hamshari. Lupo talks to Edmonds about Fonseca, believing it was Edmonds who interviewed the man, as he is the only other person with credentials at the embassy. Edmonds describes the man he met and mentions he also had a pass, prompting Lupo to realize it was Kinsdale. Upon returning to Naples, Kinsdale is confronted by McAllister, who realizes Kinsdale plans to kill Taylor and produces a computer prediction that only gives Kinsdale an eight percent chance of success. Through the same newspaper his wife read, Kinsdale realizes that the terrorists are targeting families who answer to a domestic want ad. Claiming he is surveying the effectiveness of the classified advertisements, Kinsdale learns that the Gerardi family has just made an appointment to talk to a prospective housecleaner, Miss Pidgeon. Before Kinsdale can leave, Inspector Lupo arrives to arrest him, but Kinsdale flees and manages to elude capture. That night, he breaks into the Geraldi residence armed with a gun and orders them to cooperate. When Miss Pidgeon arrives at the door, her suspicions are immediately raised and her men open fire on the house, but flee when Kinsdale returns fire, accidentally leaving behind a purse. Kinsdale goes to Janice's apartment, where he is promptly berated by McAllister for not going to the police and risking the lives of the other targeted families., but Kinsdale retorts that he will not allow the killers to be imprisoned just so another group can hold the U.S. hostage. Searching Pidgeon's purse, finds a napkin with the name of a caf√© printed on it. Going to the cafe, he finds the killers' van and spots Taylor walking outside. He gets in his car, follows Taylor down an alley, hits him with his car and then beats him bloody. Taylor stabs him with a switchblade knife, but Kinsdale disarms him, then strangles Taylor to death with a steel chain. Bleeding, Kinsdale returns to the garage, breaks into the upstairs apartment and discovers his daughter's doll and a phone number. CIA agents ambush Kinsdale, but see his stolen credentials and assume he's a State Department investigator, giving him a ride back to the embassy. Back at the base, Kamal, posing as a deliveryman, drives a small truck, with Pidgeon and ten armed men inside. They enter a closed Post Exchange building, kill the janitor and hide. When the exchange opens, they take the customers hostage and order the store manager to deliver a ransom letter to authorities. At the U.S. Embassy, Kinsdale asks a woman to dial the phone number he found. When he discovers it is for the Post Exchange, he steals a car, drives onto the base and crashes through the front windows of the building. He leaps out, shoots a number of terrorists and is wounded, but manages to knock down another killer. He pulls off one of the terrorists' masks to reveal Pidgeon, who spits in his face before he shoots her between the eyes. Another gunman takes aim on Kinsdale, but a female hostage picks up a machine gun and kills the man. Kamal take another hostage, but Kinsdale keeps shooting, forcing Kamal to run outside. Kinsdale follows and guns his wife's killer down, then falls to his knees. Inspector Lupo and Mike McAllister take the empty pistol from Kinsdale's hands as he sobs.

Born in the West Prussian city of L√∂bau (now Lubawa, Poland), Newmark emigrated to the United States in 1853, sailed from Europe to New York City to San Francisco, and finally settled in Los Angeles. The Newmark clan was one of the founding families of the Los Angeles area. Newmark's memoir, Sixty Years in Southern California: 1853‚Äì1913, has been cited in dozens of academic papers and books, and is considered to be the Los Angeles equivalent of a Pepys diary. Early years L√∂bau, now Lubawa, on an 1896 map of West and East Prussia Newmark was the son of Phillip and Esther Newmark. Phillip Newmark was born in Neumark, West Prussia, and traveled to Sweden and Denmark to sell his ink and blackening products. He made a sales trip to New York City in 1837, but became ill and returned home in 1838. His son Joseph P. Newmark, Harris's brother, emigrated to California in 1848, and beckoned Harris to follow. Many Newmark relatives already resided there. Newmark took the advice, and sailed for New York City. He then boarded a second ship for California, crossed the isthmus of Nicaragua with Leopold Harris, who would found the Harris & Frank department stores, and arrived in San Francisco in October 1853. He eventually made it to Los Angeles, where he took his first American job as a clerk for his brother Joseph P. at his partnership Rich & Newmark, a dry goods emporium. Ads for two early dry goods stores in the Los Angeles Star September 21, 1854. Harris Newmark clerked for his brother Joseph P. Newmark at Rich & Newmark. Lazard & Kremer would become the \\"City of Paris\\" store. At the time, Newmark had limited English-language skills; he spoke German, Swedish, and had picked up the Spanish language while en route to and in California. In 1854, his uncle Joseph Newmark arrived in Los Angeles with his wife and six children. They provided Newmark with a home, and his aunt taught Newmark how to read, write, and spell in English. On March 24, 1858, he married his cousin Sarah in the family home; his uncle Joseph officiated, and consequently became Harris' father-in-law. Businessman Newmark developed several successful businesses, which employed most if not all of a near-inexhaustible list of Newmark family members. Newmark was chiefly a grocer and dry goods merchant, but he also dabbled in other fields. He even tried sheep farming, but he was preoccupied with the burgeoning real estate opportunities to be had in the Los Angeles area. Newmark bought and sold properties throughout southern California, and made a fortune in the process. Upon arrival in Los Angeles he clerked for his brother Joseph P. at Rich & Newmark. In 1854, he opened a clothing store on south side of Commercial St. and east of Main St. in what had been the Prudent Beaudry building owned by Mateo Keller. For eight years he had several partners in this venture. In 1862, he went into the commission business instead. At the end of 1885, Newmark retired from the grocery business to devote more time to his real estate and investment pursuits. In 1886, he and five well-known businessmen‚ÄîNewmark, his nephew Kaspare Cohn, John D. Bicknell, Stephen M. White, and I.W. Hellman‚Äîpurchased a ranch located in East Los Angeles called Rancho Repetto. The land had been owned by an Italian settler named Alessandro Repetto, who bequeathed the ranch to his brother Antonio. Newmark's group bought the inheritance for US$60,000, or about $12 per acre. In May 1899, Newmark subdivided the tract owned by himself and his nephew, after contracting with William Mulholland to design and construct a suitable water system for the new settlement. Accounts differ on the actual size of Newmark and Cohn's parcel, but it was somewhere around 1,200 to . A piece of this tract adjacent to the tracks of the San Pedro, Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad was developed into a town site called Newmark. The remaining land was subdivided into lots suitable for small-scale agriculture. The entire settlement, including the Newmark town site, was given the name Montebello. When the town incorporated in 1920, Montebello replaced Newmark as the new city's name. Legacy Newmark made many contributions to the economy and culture of Los Angeles, and gave his time and his money to causes he felt were worthy. He was one of the founders of the Los Angeles Public Library, was a charter member of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, and was one of the organizers of the Board of Trade, which helped bring railroad service to California. He was the president of Congregation B'nai B'rith in 1887 (he inherited the title from his uncle and father-in-law Joseph Newmark) and a founder of the Jewish Orphans Home of Southern California. Newmark was also instrumental in the establishment of the Southwest Museum, which is now part of the Autry National Center. He and other Newmarks were leaders of the local Odd Fellows and were Masons. Newmark's memoir, Sixty Years in Southern California, was assembled with the assistance of his sons and a Pasadena historian. It has been called \\"one of the great autobiographies\\" by an American Jewish writer, and \\"the single most valuable memoir\\" about southern California in the nineteenth century. The American Memory project of the Library of Congress has the entire memoir available online. Harris Newmark High School, a continuation high school in the Los Angeles Unified School District is named in his honor, as is the Harris Newmark Building in downtown Los Angeles. Now called the New Mart building, the edifice was the first high- rise structure in the city, and was built in 1928 by Newmark's sons. The Braly Block at Second and Springs streets was the city's first highrise, circa 1904. Between then and the late 1950s, the only higher building that was allowed constructed was city hall. The city council imposed a height limit of 150 feet at the height of the city beautiful movement Newmark was the grandfather of Los Angeles lawyer Joseph P. Loeb, who also proofread his memoir book.

Valmeinier, located at the foot of the Mont Thabor, 3207 meters, is a medium size ski resort (about 10,000 beds). The first ski lift was built in 1973, at L'Arm√©ra, connecting to the Valloire ski area. The village at 1,500 m started to develop with the arrival of various holiday villages (Renouveau and LVT Chemins). In 1986, the resort at 1800 m was launched and the Gros Crey ski area equipped with lifts. Ski area information The ski area shared by the resorts of Valmeinier and Valloire has a new name: ‚ÄúGalibier‚Äì Thabor‚Äù. This refers to the area‚Äôs 2 emblematic summits, which peak at more than 3,000 metres. The first ski lift was installed in 1973, in L‚ÄôArmera, in order to join up with Valloire, which had already been operating for a few years. Gradually, the ski area expanded and it now features 150 km of slopes over 1,600 hectares. The snowpark, classified as 5th French snowpark and 15th European, is certified by the French Snowboard Association (AFS). It is tended daily by the resort's staff. History Settled in the 12th century, Valmeinier was practically self-sufficient with most of its inhabitants living off the land until the 17th century. At this time they discovered a high quality anthracite which they decided to mine, hence Valmeinier got its name (\\"Val des mines\\" translates as the valley of the mines). Between 1848 and 1924, bolstered by the industrialisation of the Maurienne Valley, agriculture and mining developed as the two main economic activities. Cereals (corn, wheat and rye) were grown up to 1,500 metres. During the winter season, some farmers worked as chimney-sweeps, operating in pairs, mainly in the Paris area and in Brittany. The end of the 1960s saw the end of traditional farming and also a massive exodus from the valley, by the end of the 1970s there were fewer than 80 permanent inhabitants in Valmeinier.

Etymology The word is commonly believed to derive from the practice of using the wind to assist with the turn. Another etymology, however, is the Old English word for turn - \\"windan\\", (pronounced with a short I (as in windlass, a handle for winding (long I) gears)). Old English was in use up to and including the 18th century when the canals were built. Much UK canal terminology comes from spoken rather than written tradition and from bargees who did not read or write. It is also possible that the word has a similar derivation to that of the windlass, which derives from the Old Norse \\"vinda\\" and \\"√°s\\"‚Äîwords currently used in Iceland‚Äîwhere the modern word for \\"windlass\\" is \\"vinda\\". History Because the average width of a canal channel (about 30' to 40' feet) is less than the length of a full- size narrow boat (72') it is not usually possible to turn a boat in the canal. Winding holes are typically indentations in the off-side (non-towpath side) of the canal, allowing sufficient space to turn the boat. Use A winding hole consists of a \\"notch\\" in the canal bank. A turning boat inserts its bow into the notch and swings the stern round. In the days of horse-drawn boats, this was accomplished using bargepoles.

His collections, together with those stored in the Royal Bourbon Museum, were the foundation of the Zoological Museum of Naples. The specimens were from locations all over the world, and included especially, Lepidoptera, Cnidaria and Mollusca. Biography Giuseppe Saverio Poli was born in 1746 and was the son of Vito Angelo di Giuseppe and Eleonora Corl√®. In 1766 he enrolled at the University of Padua, where he graduated in medicine. He briefly worked as a doctor in Molfetta, but in 1790 he moved to Naples to teach history and geography at the Nunziatella Military School, for which, once he became commander, with the rank of lieutenant colonel, he took care of the department of physics. In 1775 he toured Europe on behalf of the academy, visiting many seats of learning in Germany, France, England and the Netherlands and meeting naturalists and scientists. This enabled him to equip the physics department with the most modern equipment. He became friends with the Scottish physician and collector William Hunter, who encouraged him to study the molluscs of the Mediterranean, which were then very poorly known. He also added to his personal collection of natural history objects and archaeological artefacts. Later he taught physics at the Medical College of the Hospital of the Incurables, a position which he had to give up when he was appointed tutor to the hereditary prince, Francesco, son of Ferdinand I of Bourbon. He later became professor of experimental physics at the University of Naples, of which he was first director of physics. His best known work is represented by the six volumes of the Elements of Experimental Physics, which had numerous editions and reprints and was modified and integrated on several occasions by Poli himself. The work was used by Alessandro Volta for his university lectures and was even read and studied by Giacomo Leopardi. It has also been criticized by Vincenzo Dandolo, as in the 1790s it still introduced phlogiston in the part relating to chemical reactions (volume III), which had already been widely recognized as non-existent by most scientists (the part relating to chemical reactions was preceded by an introduction by Dandolo himself, which explained the partial defects of the work). The changes made in the editions of the following years were to deny the existence of phlogiston even in his own work. Thanks to his many travels, which put him in contact and correspondence with authoritative exponents of the international scientific world, he published numerous essays on various topics: not only relating to physics, but also to meteorology, in particular with the treatises on thunder (1772) and on lightning (1773), geology and zoology. Testimony of this last discipline remains the monumental Testacea utriusque Siciliane eorumque istoria et antome tabulis aeneis, a description of the molluscs of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, begun with the help of his assistant Stefano Delle Chiaje, who collaborated in its publication. Poli was responsible for the discovery of the interradial vesicles of the water vascular system of echinoderms, which are known as \\"Polian vesicles\\". He also tried his hand at poetry, with hymns and poems, of which the Celestial Journey, composed in two volumes, in 1805 provides a good example. He was a member of numerous scientific and cultural institutions, including the National Academy of Sciences. After a year in which his health deteriorated, Poli died in Naples on 7 April 1825. His personal collection of natural history objects and archaeological artefacts, amassed since the 1770s, was known by his friends as the Museo Poliano. They included minerals, fossils, mollusc shells, corals, sponges, insects (including a fine collection from Surinam), weapons, clothing, indigenous tools, paintings and scientific instruments. The more valuable items in the collection were looted by French troops during the conquest of Naples in 1806, and he later turned to collecting coins, medals and antiquities. After his death, these were curated by Delle Chiaie and acquired by the Royal Bourbon Museum and, along with his natural history collection, formed the foundation of the Zoological Museum of Naples.

Many of its characters are loosely based on real people, sometimes with names changed. Plot summary The story begins in 1858 at Charton School, a fictional English public school (i.e. secondary boys‚Äô private school in North American usage) where Dr. George Onslow, a clergyman of great note, is headmaster. Onslow is credited with having turned around the previously poor reputation of the school: it is now seen as a very successful institution. But Onslow has a secret: he is sexually attracted to many of the pupils and has had affairs with several of them. There is also much homosexual behaviour amongst the boys themselves, a situation that may be due to Onslow's relatively permissive attitude. The plot of the story begins to unfold when one of Onslow's young lovers‚ÄîArthur Bright‚Äîreveals his affair with the headmaster to another pupil, Christian Anstey-Ward, an idealistic young man who admires the ancient Greek ideal of Platonic love between males. Christian is shocked and incredulous, but is forced to believe Arthur when the latter gives him a passionate letter indiscreetly written to him by Onslow. Christian leaves Charton that year, still in possession of the letter. The following Summer he has a homosexual experience with a boy a little younger than himself and the guilt and self-doubt precipitated by this event prompts him to consider whether he should break Arthur‚Äòs confidence and reveal Onslow‚Äòs secret. While on holiday in Europe, he describes the whole affair in a letter to his father. The rest of the novel relates how the latter is able to use this information to exert a powerful hold on Onslow, which radically affects not only his career, but also his personal relationships and inner life. Allusions to actual history, geography, and current science In an author's note, Frances Vernon explains that she based the central plot on events surrounding the resignation of Charles John Vaughan, Headmaster of Harrow School 1844-59, as recounted in the memoirs of John Addington Symonds, though she adds that many of the characters have undergone considerable elaboration or, in some cases, total invention.

The albums were fashioned from an informal two-track tape recording made by Hendrix which was subsequently stolen from his apartment. The jam took place at The Scene, a nightclub club in New York City, and various dates and participants have been suggested. Although it presents a unique setting, critics and biographers have generally found fault with the sound quality and Morrison's performance. Background To relieve the pressures of touring and recording, Jimi Hendrix frequently jammed with musicians at local clubs. He was also a tape-recording enthusiast and traveled with his Sony two-track reel-to-reel recorder. Hendrix recorded several after-hours jams in New York for his personal use, around the time that he began recording material for the Electric Ladyland album at the Record Plant studio. Some of these include jams at the Cafe Au Go Go on March 17, 1968, with members of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band (Elvin Bishop, Phillip Wilson) and the Electric Flag (Harvey Brooks, Buddy Miles) and the Generation Club on April 15, 1968, with B.B. King, Bishop, Wilson, Buzzy Feiten, and Al Kooper. Partly because of its proximity to the Record Plant, Hendrix frequently jammed at the Scene club, which was owned by Steve Paul, the McCoys and later Johnny Winter's manager.After a May 2, 1968 jam at the Scene, he returned to the Record Plant with Steve Winwood, Jack Casady, and Mitch Mitchell to record \\"Voodoo Chile\\". Recording Several dates have been mentioned for the Scene club jam, including March 13, and June 6, 1968. In addition to Hendrix and Morrison, other jam participants have been tentatively identified as the Scene's house band, the McCoys (bassist Randy Jo Hobbs and drummer Randy Zehringer), bassist Harvey Brooks, and drummer Buddy Miles. Most albums list guitarist Johnny Winter, who occasionally jammed with Hendrix, as the second guitarist, although he emphatically denied ever having met or performed with Jim Morrison or being in New York at the time. The McCoy's Rick Derringer has also been suggested as the other guitarist. Horgea mentions Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell as participants. AllMusic Review. The harmonica player has not been identified ‚Äì at times Morrison is singing while the harmonica plays, which suggests a sixth participant. Jimi Hendrix plays guitar on all of the songs and sings two. His version of his slow blues \\"Red House\\" has been singled out as the session highlight, which uses an uptempo arrangement similar to that of Cream's rendition of \\"Crossroads\\". He and the second guitarist trade guitar parts, with backing by bass and drums (Morrison and harmonica are not audible on the track). Except for part of the Elmore James slow blues \\"Bleeding Heart\\", the remainder of the jam is disjointed and includes rambling harmonica accompaniment and \\"Morrison's drunken hollering\\". Snippets of instrumental passages and ad-libbed lyrics have led the album's producers to give the tracks names, such as \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", \\"Outside Woman Blues\\", \\"If You Wake Up This Morning (And Found Yourself Dead)\\", \\"Uranus Rock\\", etc., although these are brief jam themes and not actual songs. Releases Before and especially after Hendrix's death in 1970, many of his personal belongings were stolen. These included many of his home tape recordings. Although they were not intended for public release, some recordings have been issued many times on numerous albums, usually by small record labels that specialize in bootleg and gray market albums. The Scene club jam was first issued in 1972 with the title Sky High by Skydog Records. Nutmeg Records released it in 1978 as High, Live 'n Dirty with a prominent \\"X Rated\\" on the front. In 1980, the album was issued as Woke Up This Morning and Found Myself Dead on the Red Lightnin' label. The album's liner notes state that the tapes of the jam were the property of Mick Cox, guitarist for Eire Apparent, who Hendrix later produced, and imply that it is the first legitimate release of the album. The now-defunct Castle Communications issued it as Bleeding Heart in 1994, also making claims. However, Hendrix biographers (see References section) and the official Hendrix website do not support these views. Other releases include such titles as Jamming Live at the Scene Club, NYC, NYC '68, Live At The Scene Club, N.Y., N.Y., Tomorrow Never Knows, Sunshine Of Your Love, etc. Critical reception AllMusic has reviews for four different iterations of the Scene club jam album, which more or less include the same material, although some with different names and sequencing. The ratings range from three (out of five stars) to one and a half stars. The albums have been described as \\"exceedingly lo-fi\\", \\"interesting because it records for posterity two '60s icons on stage and the ensuing hilarity\\", and \\"a horribly drunken, obscenity-spewing Jim Morrison only makes the experience that much more unpleasant\\". While one reviewer noted the album was \\"mandatory for completists, Hendrix fanatics and historians\\", others conclude \\"nothing on this LP can be considered essential\\" and \\"it sheds absolutely no new light on the guitarist's enduring legend\\".

Early life Born Laurel Anne Harte in the San Fernando Valley, California, on New Year's Eve, 1945,Douglas Martin, \\"Laurel Burch, Artist, Dies at 61\\", The New York Times, September 20, 2007. Retrieved 2013-05-11. to parents Anne and Russell Harte. When the couple divorced, Anne supported Laurel and her sister Suzi with her work as a seamstress and designer. Laurel's mother was seamstress and designer for the singer Peggy Lee and her daughter. Anne described a strange moment where she had spent weeks shopping for shoes, ribbons, hat, fabrics to make an Easter outfit for Peggy's daughter. She sewed all night before Easter morning and drove the beautiful outfit to Peggy's home in Beverly Hills dragging Laurel and Suzanne out of bed before daybreak. As she returned to the car seeing her girls' knowing they had no Easter outfits waiting for them, their hair all messy with sleep, Anne was heartbroken. One can acknowledge there was the love there and the grief of a single mother. Laurel grew up with a mixture of love and loss, but also with a keen brilliant artistic eye from her parents. A rift grew between Laurel and her mother when Laurel was a teenager. While in high school, Laurel lived for a period with her father, her half-brothers and half-sister in La Canada, California but the arrangement ended abruptly. Laurel supported herself by working as a cook, house cleaner and baby-sitter. When Laurel was 19 she married a jazz musician, Robert Burch. They parted after a few years together, Laurel becoming a single parent herself. With two children to care for, she supported herself by making jewelry with occasional help from Ann, then sold her designs to several businesses. Career Laurel Burch went on to launch her business, now called Laurel Burch Artworks, in the late 1960s. She began making paintings and was commissioned by restaurants, businesses and private collectors. \\"I found metal in a junkyard and hammered it out on the back of an old frying pan\\", she stated during an interview with the Marin Independent Journal in 2005. She began making jewelry and selling it on the streets of San Francisco from tackle boxes. Some local stores began stocking her creations, and a businessman, Shashi Singapuri, took samples of her work to China. She went to China in 1971 and discovered cloisonn√©, a kind of enamel work, with which she designed paintings and had the designs made into earrings. With Mr. Singapuri's financial backing manufacturing began. Burch went on to work on cast metals and wood, and to include spinoff products on paper, porcelain and fabric. In 1979, she split with Singapuri, and started Laurel Burch Inc. She was president and chief designer. In the 1990s she licensed her designs to a dozen or so companies that now make and distribute her creations worldwide. Personal life Burch's second marriage, to Jack Holton, also ended in divorce. Her third husband was Rick Sara. She died on September 13, 2007, aged 61, at her home in Novato, California from complications of osteopetrosis, a rare and painful bone disease she had her entire life, suffering more than 100 bone fractures as a result. In addition to Rick Sara, she was survived by her daughter, Aarin; her son, Jay; her sisters, Suzanne Neilson and Jil Chandler; her half-sister Mary Ellen Piraino; her half-brothers William (Bill) Russell Harte, and Brian Lowell Harte; and two granddaughters, Soffiya and Karly.

Ambuclao, Bokod, Benguet province in the Philippines. With maximum water storage capacity of , the facility, which is located from Baguio city, can produce up to 105 megawatts of electricity to Luzon grid. The main source of water comes from the Agno River which originates from Mount Data. It is located in a conservation area known as the Upper Agno River Basin Resource Reserve.http://www.cityofpines.com/ambuklao.html The dam and other non-power components are owned by the government through the National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR).  Ambuklao Hydro  Ambuklao reservoir The Ambuklao Hydroelectric Power Plant is one of the oldest power plants in the country and was among the first large hydroelectric power plants constructed in the Philippines. The development of the Agno River for purposes of hydroelectric power generation, flood control, and irrigation had been conceived as early as the late 1940s. Preliminary investigations for development at Ambuklao and Binga Dam sites were undertaken as early as January 1948. Running along the upper portion of the Agno River, Ambuklao Hydro was constructed for power generation and flood control. In July 1990, a massive earthquake hit Luzon, resulting in siltation and technical problems that affected the plant's operations. Ambuklao was eventually decommissioned in 1999. SN Aboitiz Power-Benguet, Inc. (SNAP- Benguet) won on November 28, 2007, the public bid for Ambuklao and its neighboring power facility Binga, which were sold as a package under the power sector privatization program of the Philippine government. SNAP-Benguet is a joint venture between SN Power of Norway, and Aboitiz Power Corporation.http://www.philstar.com/business/740905/aboitiz-group-opens- ambuklao-dam SNAP-Benguet began a massive rehabilitation project that restored Ambuklao to operating status and increased its capacity from 75 MW to 105 MW. The project required the construction of a new intake, headrace and penstock, elevation of tailrace tunnel outlet, de-silting of tailrace tunnel and replacement of electro-mechanical components. In June 2011, Unit 3 became the first turbine unit to go on-line, followed by the other two units. Ambuklao was formally inaugurated in October 2011. Ambuklao is designed as a peaking plant and is capable of delivering energy and providing ancillary services needed to stabilize the grid.

Arola became part of the Aixam group in 1983. Models 10, 11, 12 Arola started manufacturing road vehicles with a range of tricycles, models 10, 11, and 12. They shared the tubular frame, front and rear coil suspension, cable brakes, polyester body, and many other components. The driver sat on a flat bench without a back and controlled his cyclecar like a motorbike. General layout met French legislation of the day for permission-free driving. They were single-seater. The 10 and 11 did not have a speedometer and ashtray, the 11 takes advantage of the storage bag found in the 12. All had electric starters, wipers and the chromed muffler could be transverse or longitudinally mounted. The main difference was in the power train: the 10 and 11 used a 47 cc (2.85 c.i.) Saxonette single-cylinder engine by Fichtel & Sachs that delivered about 3 HP (2.2 kW), coupled to a two-speed automatic transmission. The 12 featured a Motob√©cane 50 cc (3.05 c.i.) which had a reverse gear. While top speed for Models 10 and 11 was about 25 mph (40 km/h), the 12 was good for 40 mph (65 km/h). Detachable and transparent plexiglas doors were available. All models had a length of 72.45 in. (1,840 mm), a width of 42.13 in. (1,070 mm), a height of 61.81 in. (1,570 mm), and weighed in at 242.5 lb (110 kg). Model 12 was built until 1982. Production of the Saxonette-powered vehicles ended earlier. Model SP In 1978, Arola presented a somewhat larger variant of the Model 12, called SP. It was 89.567 in. (2,275 mm) long, other dimensions were the same as the 12's. SP meant here not \\"Sport\\" but \\"Super Practical\\". To meet that purpose, additional length went completely into a tiny pickup bed. It was built until 1982, together with the 12. Models 14, 15 and Compacity 1968 Arola When Arola presented its first range of quadricycles in 1979, they bore close resemblance with the earlier models. The main difference, of course, was the front axle with conventional steering by a center-positioned steering wheel. This layout was chosen before it became evident that French legislation for this class of vehicles would be changed soon to allow to carry two persons instead of one. The seat \\"bench\\" was still here, but now a similar back was added. Plexiglass doors were now standard equipment. Model 14 got them with cooling louvres, Model 15 instead had them with sliding (real) glass inserts. Length was 74.02 in. (1,880 mm), other dimensions were the same as those of the tricycles. It is not clear if the Compacity saw actual production. Obviously, it served the same purpose with the four-wheelers as the SP did with their three-wheelers. This little Pickup truck was offered officially from 1980 to 1982. Production of the Models 14, 15 and Compacity halted in 1982. Models 18 and 20 Arola 20 Model 18 was introduced in 1981. It is somewhat larger and has an even more squarish shape than its predecessors. Above all, it is built on an innovative concept with an aluminum-reinforced polyester floor, and a body constructed of an aluminum structure that carries the polyester body panels. There were four engines to choose: Three 50 cc by BCB, Motob√©cane or Peugeot, and a 125 cc BCB which gave the vehicle a top speed of 40 mph (ca. 65 km/h). The Model 18S was a little bit more sophisticated and had amenities like a clock. Model 18 was 78.47 in. (2000 mm) long, had a width of 49.21 in (1,250 mm) and weighed in at lb 418.88 pounds (190 kg). All were designed mainly for ease of operation, comfort, and safety, and not to be stylish. The transmission was simplicity itself - a stick, pushed forward for forward motion and pulled backwards for reverse. Minoto The Arola Minoto used the same name and body shape as an earlier prototype microcar from Bel Motors International, a short-live offshoot of the Bellier microcar company. The Minoto name is a portmanteau derived from the terms \\"miniature\\" and \\"automobile\\" as expressed in French language. Aside from taking its predecessors name and shape, the Arola Minoto was completely different, with a molded, self-supporting bodyshell of polyester. The Minoto was powered by a 50 cc engine, either by Motob√©cane or Peugeot. Later, a Lombardini Diesel with was added. Much more conventional in design than other Arolas, its dimensions were: Length width and weight .

De Mol - like many of his contemporaries - had a great interest in poetry and scientific experiments. Life Portrait of Joannes de Mol by Pieter Oets (1720-1790). Kasteel-museum Sypesteyn, Nieuw- Loosdrecht. De Mol was born in 1726 at Midlum, near Harlingen and, like his father, studied theology in Leiden. His first post was at 's-Gravenpolder in Zeeland, before moving in 1752 to Oud-Loosdrecht. There he got to know one of the richest women in Amsterdam, Anna de Haze who had a country house in the village and a collection of Meissen porcelain. In 1774 De Mol bought a clay part, stored in the Muiderslot, left over from the porcelain factory in Weesp. That factory started in 1759 by Bertrand Philip, count of Gronsveld, bailiff of Muiden and member of the Admiralty of Amsterdam. The factory was declared a failure in 1770, and hardly produced a little more for its last two years. De Mol began with experiments in his garden shed behind the parsonage, opposite the church in Oud-Loosdrecht. In 1774, he started producing porcelain as a way of creating employments for the local population in the impoverished peat district. A part of the production process, however, was sited in Bilthoven.Zappey, W.M. (1988) De Loosdrechtse porseleinfabriek 1774-1784. In: Blaauwen, A.L. den, et al. (1988) Loosdrechts porselein 1774-1784. On a country estate, property of the youngest brother of Belle van Zuylen, stood a \\"pletmolen met stamperij\\" (mill with grinding facilities), where feldspar, but possibly also cheap Chinese porcelain was added and ground up. The raw materials were mixed up with suitable white clay (from England?) and quartz in a cellar in Utrecht, and shipped to Oud-Loosdrecht. The factory at Oud- Loosdrecht employed sixty men, of which twenty acted as painters and 25 were children, who also were trained in drawing. Under the foreign employees was Louis Victor Gerverot, then known as a painter of exotic birds on porcelain. To finance the business, a few regents in Amsterdam, along with his sister-in- law, Eva de Mol-van Eibergen, acted as guarantor, jointly invested 200,000 guilders in the factory. In 1779, De Mol was laureated by the Economics Branch for the care of his workforce. De Mol took former soldiers from Surinam to employ. The managers of the Suriname Company had made contact with him and convened in his business. J.G. Eichhorn, a German, who had a stiff right arm, was given a salary of two guilders per week and the Association provided a same sum .Habermehl, N.D.B. (2000) Joan Cornelis van der Hoop (1742‚Äî1825). Marinebestuurder voor stadhouder Willem V en koning Willem I, p. 41. Nevertheless De Mol - who had in the meantime become a patriot - had major difficulties keeping his head above water. His products were expensive: a cup and saucer costing seven guilder, then more than a week's salary for most. De Mol's main fear was his competitor Anton Lyncke in the Hague, who imported white porcelain from Germany to the Hague for painting. De Mol organised special lotteries to finance his work, but in 1781 was again forced to borrow money from the Amsterdam banker and art collector Jan Hope. Barbara van der Hoeven, Hope's wife, came into the possession of 25% of the shares in the Manufactuur Old-Loosdrecht (M.O.L.). Old age Because of weak health and output problems, De Mol had to sell his factory in 1782 for 12,000 guilder to four Amsterdam regents: Joachim Rendorp, John Hope, Abraham Dedel and Cornelis van der Hoop. His creditors put in place a new manager, Frederik Daeuber. De Mol died two weeks later at a prestigious lodging de Rondeel on the river Amstel. The innkeeper tried to take possession of de Mol's stock in the warehouse on Singel. Johannes de Mol always had the illusion that his son would follow in his footsteps. In 1783, however, Huibert fled to Germany with a 19-year-old (under age) noble girl from Maarssen. In 1784, porcelain production was moved to Amsterdam. It received the protection of Louis Bonaparte, in 1806 the first king of the Netherlands. About 1820, it ceased porcelain production.

It allows members to browse the profiles of any other members, and share tags and virtual gifts. Tagged claims it has 300 million members as of 2014. As of September 2011, Quantcast estimates Tagged monthly unique users at 5.9 million in the United States, and 18.6 million globally. Michael Arrington wrote in April 2011 that Tagged is most notable for the ability to grow profitably during the era of Facebook. In 2009, Tagged was criticized for sending deceptive bulk email and paid $1.4 million in legal settlements regarding those practices. The company has since adopted privacy reforms and changed its invitation processes. Owned by Ifwe, Inc., it is an Inc. 500 company ranking #476 on the 2010 Inc. list of fastest-growing independent U.S. private companies and #80 on Forbes 2011 list of America's Most Promising Companies. On April 3, 2017, the company was acquired by The Meet Group. History Tagged Inc. was co-founded in mid-2004 by entrepreneurs Greg Tseng and Johann Schleier-Smith, who wanted to build a \\"Teen Yahoo! or the next MTV\\". The pair had formerly co-founded internet incubator Jumpstart Technologies, which was later fined $900,000 for alleged violations of the CAN-SPAM Act, then the largest-ever penalty for spam. In September 2005 the company raised $1.5 million in angel investor funding and three months later raised an additional $7 million from Mayfield Fund, a venture capital firm. Originally an under-18 site, Tagged allowed users of any age to join from October 2006. In March 2008, Microsoft announced a commercial partnership with social networking sites Tagged, Facebook, LinkedIn, Bebo, and hi5 regarding email contacts APIs, which has since been implemented. Other past and current Tagged partnerships have included Slide, RockYou, PhotoBucket, Meebo, Razz, and Jangl. In February 2009, following complaints from the public Tagged was blocked in Qatar by the only ISP, Qtel, due to inappropriate content that Qtel could not selectively filter. Tagged.com had been one of the top ten most visited sites in Qatar. In January 2010, Tagged announced that it was donating $50,000 to the Y√©le Haiti Earthquake Fund, partly stemming from user donations. In the same month, Tagged won a $200,000 judgment against Erik Voegler, who was spamming other Tagged users. In May 2010, Tagged was named in Lead411's \\"2010 Hottest San Francisco Companies\\", a list of the fastest-growing companies in the software, wireless, internet, and media industries, and in October 2010, Tagged ranked #100 on Deloitte's list of the top 500 fastest growing technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences and clean technology companies in North America. In April 2011, Tagged acquired Digsby, a multi-protocol instant messenger and social network notification client for Windows with 3 million registered users. As of October 2011, Tagged had 150 employees, an increase from 55 employees at the beginning of 2011. CEO Greg Tseng continues to interview employees, cater lunch and dinner, and hold office-wide meetings every Friday. Tagged is a member of the Social Media Advertising Consortium, a trade industry association that aims to increase advertising revenue and to facilitate collaboration among social networking sites, advertisers, and marketing researchers. In September 2011, Tagged made a second acquisition, the gaming application WeGame. In November 2011, Tagged was named to the Forbes list of \\"America's Most Promising Companies\\". In December 2011, Tagged acquired Hi5 Networks Inc., which was once the third-largest social network behind Facebook and MySpace. The deal, whose terms were not disclosed, added Hi5's 230 million members to Tagged's base of 100 million registered users. Also in December 2011, Tagged acquired Topicmarks, a natural language processing and machine learning company.Constine, Josh \\"Tagged Acquires Topicmarks\\", TechCrunch, December 9, 2011.  Deceptive bulk email  Between April and June 2009, Tagged sent tens of millions of misleading spam emails like this one, which falsely stated that a contact sent photographs to the recipient. In June 2009, Time magazine columnist Sean Gregory called Tagged \\"The world's most annoying website\\". Tagged asked users for their email username and password, retrieved email addresses from their address books, and repeatedly sent email invitations to people who were not registered on Tagged, falsely stating that they have been \\"added as a friend\\" or that the inviter had sent them photos on Tagged. This process has been labelled an \\"e-mail scam\\" by consumer anti-fraud advocates and drawn criticism in the technology press and from users.User comments at McAfee Site Advisor The emails were discussed as possible spam by Black Web 2.0 and the resemblance to a virus was noted by urban legend site Snopes.com. The New York Times referred to the practice as \\"contact scraping\\". In July 2009 New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced his intention to sue Tagged for \\"deceptive email marketing and invasion of privacy\\". Tagged reached a settlement in which it agreed to pay $500,000 and to modify its promotional practices. Simultaneously, Tagged settled an enforcement action by the state of Texas, agreeing to pay $250,000 in penalties and fees. Conditions of the settlement included \\"clear and conspicuous\\" disclosure of the use of information in the user's email address book, providing a clear method to skip the step and display to users the specific emails to be sent. Tagged has adopted these reforms and changed its invitation processes. In February 2010, Tagged settled a class action lawsuit about its former registration process with California residents Miriam Slater and Sara Golden and awarded them $10,000 each. Tagged also agreed to destroy email addresses that were collected from users between April and June 2009, if those users did not mean to invite their contacts to the site. In April 2010, San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris announced that Tagged agreed to pay $650,000 to settle claims of deceptive emails. This settlement related to emails sent from April 2009 through June 2009.  Aborted IPO, shift in focus  In October 2014, Tagged aborted plans to perform an initial public offering, citing decreased revenue due to the proliferation of mobile devices. On October 16, 2014, Tagged performed a number of changes at the corporate level, including acquiring the social messaging startup Tinode and naming its co-founders, Dash Gopinath and Gene Sokolov, to the positions of chief product officer and senior vice president of engineering respectively. Tagged also announced that its parent company would be re-named Ifwe, Inc. (stylized If(we), and that the company overall would focus on becoming an incubator for new mobile software, although it will continue to run Tagged and Hi5.  Website  After registering a free account, Tagged users can customize their profile page, to which they can post a biography about themselves and their interests, post status updates, upload photos, and send and receive messages. There is also an option to upgrade the membership for a monthly fee, which allows users to see which other users have recently viewed their profile, among other additional features. They can also sort videos by most viewed, top rated, and most liked, and send virtual gifts to their friends. Virtual gifts are bought with \\"gold\\" which users buy with actual money or receive by completing special offers or tasks. There are chat rooms where users engage in real time online chat according to their age and mood. Designed to facilitate relationships and dating, Tagged allows users to send and receive notifications for \\"Luv\\", \\"Winks\\", and \\"Meet Me\\", a rating engine that allows users to rate the attractiveness of photos submitted by others. On October 30, 2009, Tagged announced a simpler signup process. Mobile versions Tagged developed a mobile version of its site in April 2011, making Tagged more usable by smartphones with a mobile internet browser. This version allows users to send and receive friend requests, play games, and send messages. This mobile version also offers location-based, real-time chat for users. Tagged began offering an iPhone application from July 2010, which was downloaded more than 100,000 times in its first week. Tagged's Android application became available in March 2011. By April 2011, the Android versions, had slightly more users than on the iPhone application, and in May 2011 it was the number three social networking application on the Android. In the latest update of their iOS and Android Apps, Tagged has added the capability of refreshing data by using the \\"pulling down\\" gesture and loading more data by using the \\"pulling up\\" gesture. In June 2011 Tagged launched its first BlackBerry application.Mobile Being a native application, it runs on a mixture of HTML and the device systems. Social games Social games on Tagged differ from those on other social networking services, because players are encouraged to make new friends through the games. In May 2010, Tagged opened its own in-house gaming division. Leading the division is Andrew Pedersen, former vice president of the Pogo division of Electronic Arts. Tagged plans to create more social games, several of which are already in development. Together with its acquisition of Digsby, Tagged's focus on social games signals an attempt to add more social communication options to its platform. Launched in 2008, Pets was Tagged's first game and, as of May 2011, remains the most popular. Similar to a fantasy sports league, players use virtual cash to \\"buy\\" others and own them like pets, then barter them with other players or sell at a set price. Virtual cash can be earned by players in several ways, such as frequently logging into Tagged, converting Tagged gold at the Pets Cash Bar into Pets Cash and using real money. Farm was introduced in May 2011. Unlike Zynga's Farmville on Facebook, there is no animation or farmer. Advancement is based on virtual money earned by harvesting plants and animals in the game. Other past games on Tagged included Zynga games such as Mafia Wars & Poker and Crowdstar's Happy Aquarium. Child safety Initially targeting U.S. teens, Tagged opened to users worldwide aged 13 and older in October 2006 and still maintains security measures for users under 18. Users over 16 and the public cannot view the profiles of 13- and 14-year-olds, and profiles for 15- and 16-year-olds are private to the public and to users over 18. The only way to add teens as friends is by knowing the email address or surnames to request the friendship, and the younger user must accept the friendship request. However, the security measures are not entirely successful. In February 2009, a high-school teacher was arrested after having sex with a 14-year-old girl he had met on Tagged. The 32-year-old teacher, who was not listed on either state or national sex offender websites, had over 100 female friends below the age of 17. In December 2009 New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced that Tagged and 13 other social networking sites agreed to remove registered sex offenders under the New York Electronic Securing and Targeting of Online Predators Act. Nevertheless, a 2010 undercover investigation by Cuomo's office claimed that graphic images of children being sexually abused were readily accessible on Tagged. Investigators registered accounts at Tagged and reported inappropriate content to Tagged administrators following procedures described on the site. They found \\"significant lapses\\" in Tagged's response to these reports. At a news conference, Cuomo referred to Tagged as \\"one of the worst social networking sites that we've encountered\\". As of February 20, 2014, users must be at least 18 years old to have an account on Tagged. User demographics and site traffic , Alexa rankings suggest the popularity of Tagged peaked in early 2009 and has been declining since. Each month Tagged is visited by 5.9 million American users and 18.6 million users worldwide. Hitwise data shows that between December 2008 and December 2009 Facebook drove category growth, and the only other site to grow in market share during that period was Tagged, which increased its share by 35%. In September 2009, Tagged had a 2.38% share of the social networking site market in the United States based on monthly visits. Though originally a teen-only site, Tagged now has more members in the 35- to 49-year-old group than in any other; as of 2011, teens in the United States accounted for 10% of its members. Sixty-four percent of users earn under $60,000 per year and 60% have less than a college education. In the United States, users of Tagged are more likely than Internet users in general to be female or African American. Eighty percent of Tagged users also use Facebook. According to ComScore December 2009 data, users spent two minutes longer on average on Tagged than Facebook users do on Facebook. In May 2010, ComScore reported that Tagged entered the top 10 U.S. Online Display Ad Publishers for the first time. Tagged.com was ranked at number 10 with a 0.6% share of the total market, having served 6.8 billion ads in the United States in the first quarter 2010. In September 2010, Tagged surpassed 100 million registered members, of whom a quarter to a third were active monthly. Revenue grew to over $30 million, and 2011 revenue was predicted by Tseng to be over $50 million.

The weapon entered production in 1940, but soon after the outbreak of the German-Soviet War, production ceased; only a limited number of pieces were built. These guns saw service in the Red Army during the war. Development=Background Until the late 1930s, Soviet divisional artillery consisted of 76.2 mm guns, designed to use the same model 1900 cartridge case, complemented by 122 mm howitzers. The reason for continued reliance on the 76.2 mm caliber was that the USSR had a large supply of 76.2 mm ammunition, some delivered during World War I and also possessed suitable manufacturing equipment. Various improvements in metallurgy, chemistry and ordnance design allowed the production of guns such as the USV and the ZiS-3, which were superior to the older ones in many respects, being lighter and featuring modern split trail carriages. However, all these improvements could not remedy the inherent weakness of the existing high-explosive shell. The 76.2 mm caliber was chosen by the Russian Imperial Army prior to the trench warfare era for its sufficient shrapnel performance; but high-explosive shells of the caliber contained a relatively small amount of explosives (typically some 600-700 grams) that were only moderately effective against field fortifications. Work on 95 mm guns The decision to initiate development of larger caliber divisional guns was made in the second half of 1937.Shirokorad - Encyclopedia of the Soviet Artillery. Late that year the 95 mm was proposed. On 10 March 1938 the Main Directorate of Artillery (GAU) initiated work on a 95 mm divisional gun at the Kirov Plant and the No. 92 Plant. The former quickly abandoned the development, but the UZTM Uralmash production facility swiftly joined the program. Both guns were supposed to have a companion piece in the form of the 122 mm howitzer. The UZTM project, U-4, used the same carriage as the 122 mm howitzer U-2; but the development was never completed. At the No. 92 Plant, the team headed by V. G. Grabin developed a gun designated the F-28, based on the carriage of the F-25 122 mm howitzer. The first prototype was ready in December 1938, even before the project was officially approved by the GAU on 23 March 1939. The F-28 reached ground trials on 12 February 1940. However, in the spring of 1940 all work on the 95 mm pieces was canceled due to a decision to adopt even larger calibers for divisional artillery. Work on 107 mm guns Front view Rear view Left side view Right side view The GAU decided to start working on a 107 mm divisional gun in the autumn of 1938. The reason typically cited for this decision was the reluctance to introduce a new caliber, such as 95 mm. The 107 mm was used by both the Russian Imperial Army and the Red Army; Soviet industry manufactured both guns and ammunition, so the transition from 76 mm guns would be simpler and cheaper. One problem of using such a large caliber was the significant increase in weight. However, it was deemed possible to develop a powerful 107 mm gun in the same weight category as the 4-ton 152 mm howitzer M1938 (M-10), which, when adopted in 1939, was considered sufficiently mobile for a divisional piece. In 1940 the GAU already had another incentive in the form of intelligence reports (which were incorrect) about the Wehrmacht adopting new tanks with thicker armor. The head of the GAU, Grigory Kulik, questioned the ability of the existing 45 mm anti-tank and 76 mm divisional artillery to fight these new vehicles. This concern eventually led to the adoption of much more powerful 57 mm anti-tank and 107 mm divisional pieces by the Red Army. These new guns were not designed to fully replace the 45 mm and 76 mm weapons, but to complement them. On 14 October 1938, the No. 172 Plant received a technical requirement for a 107 mm piece. The gun was developed in three variants, designated M-25, M-45 and M-60. The first two utilized the carriage of the M-10 howitzer; the prototypes successfully passed trials, but the new M-60 was preferred. Initially, the M-60 was also being developed in two variants, which differed in the arrangement for transportation - in one variant, the barrel was pulled back, while in the other the upper carriage was rotated 180 degrees. Of these, the former was selected. On 13 December 1939 the prototypes reached ground trials, which continued until 23 April 1940. After some improvements, the gun successfully passed army trials between 11 and 25 October 1940 and was adopted as the '107 mm universal high power divisional gun M1940'. After the cancellation of the F-28 project, the design bureau of the No. 92 Plant also worked on a 107 mm gun. Late in 1940 the plant produced a ZiS-24 prototype, featuring a very long 73.5 caliber barrel placed on the carriage of a 152 mm howitzer-gun M1937 (ML-20). While very powerful, the gun was also very heavy and expensive, and the project was abandoned. Later the same design bureau worked on another 107 mm gun, which combined the carriage of a M-60 and a barrel with identical ballistics to the ZiS-6 anti-tank gun. After the outbreak of the German-Soviet War the project was canceled. There was also an attempt to develop a casemate gun based on the M-60. The technical requirements were approved on 27 July 1940. The design bureau of the No. 352 Plant worked on the project from 22 September. This project, too, was canceled due to the outbreak of the war. Production The gun entered production at the No. 352 Plant in Novocherkassk and at the No. 172 Plant. The former contributed 25 pieces in 1940 and a further 101 in 1941. Soon after the outbreak of the German-Soviet War, production ceased for the following reasons: *A shortage of artillery tractors with sufficient power meant divisional artillery would have difficulty in transporting the heavy gun; *Corps level artillery was disbanded with the disbanding of rifle corps; *No immediate need for a heavy gun with good anti-tank performance was perceived; *The gun was complicated to produce and demanding to maintain; *In the extreme circumstances of 1941, the Soviet Union did not have any spare industrial capacity for the M-60. Description The barrel consisted of a loose liner and jacket which was screwed into the breech; the breechblock was of the interrupted screw type, borrowed from the 122 mm howitzer M1910/30. The variable length recoil system consisted of a hydraulic recoil buffer and hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The gun was fitted with segment-type elevation gear and screw-type traverse gear. The carriage was of the split trail type, with trolleybus-type wheels and rubber tires. To protect the crew from small arms fire and shell fragments, a shield was fitted. In the traveling position, the barrel was pulled back. Short-distance movement with the barrel in the original position was permitted, as long as the speed did not exceed 6‚Äì7 km/h. Organization and service Despite being developed as a divisional gun, the M-60 was never used by Red Army rifle divisions. In 1941, M-60s served in anti-tank artillery brigades; according to the official organization, these consisted of two regiments, each with a battalion of M-60s, (12 pieces) and two battalions of 85 mm anti-aircraft guns, with both types of weapons employed as heavy anti-tank guns. In practice, most of the brigades never received their 107 mm guns. These brigades were disbanded in late 1941 and the surviving M-60s were used in independent 12-gun battalions.Ivanov - Artillery of the USSR in Second World War. In 1943 rifle corps were reintroduced. Corps artillery regiments received most of the surviving 107 mm guns, along with 122 mm guns and 152 mm howitzers; in total, each regiment had 16-20 pieces.Military History Journal, no 5, 2005. Since the M-60 was a limited production weapon, reports about its actual use in combat are rare. Some saw action at the Battle of Kursk, with Central Front forces.Kolomiets, Svirin - The Kursk Salient. Six M-60s were used during the liberation of Sevastopol in 1944. A few pieces were captured by the Wehrmacht; they were designated 10.7 cm K 353(r) by the Germans. A surviving piece can be seen in the Artillery Museum in Saint Petersburg. Summary The German attack in 1941 led to a situation in which the Soviet Union had neither the requirement for a weapon like the M-60 nor the industrial capacity for its production. As a result, only a limited number of pieces were supplied to the Red Army. The M-60 was the last 107 mm piece adopted by the Red Army. Although in 1943 another 107 mm gun, the 9S-1, was developed, it never reached production. Until the end of the war, the divisional artillery continued to rely on 76 mm guns (in conjunction with 122 mm howitzers), while larger formations employed heavier, more powerful weapons such as the 122 mm A-19. When a need for a very powerful anti-tank gun was identified later in the war, the 100 mm BS-3 was developed. Unlike the M-60, the BS-3 used fixed ammunition, resulting in a better rate of fire; the BS-3 was also lighter (3.6 tons) and had a shorter deployment time because its barrel was not pulled back for transportation. However, the use of fixed rounds - and a limited assortment of 100 mm ammunition - made it less useful as a field gun. In 1945 another weapon intended for a similar role was adopted, in the form of the 85 mm gun D-44. For the sake of comparison, the standard German 105 mm gun, the 10.5 cm sK 18, had similar characteristics. It somewhat surpassed the M-60 in range (19 km, or 21 km for a modernized K 18/40), but was much heavier at about six tons. The German gun also fired a somewhat lighter (15 kg) shell.Shirokorad - The God of War of The Third Reich. Another comparable weapon was the British BL 4.5-inch Medium Field Gun. Although much heavier than the M-60, it fired a 25 kg projectile to nearly 19 km. Ammunition The M-60 fired separately loaded ammunition, with the propellant charge in the cartridge. Projectiles used by the older M1910/30 could be utilized, but with a different cartridge case and propellant charge. Three different charges - full, first and second - were used. The explosion of the OF-420 shell, with the fuse set to the fragmentation action, resulted in damage to 90% of targets in the 6 to 14 meters area and to 50% of targets in a 20 to 42 meter area. When the fuse was set to high-explosive action, the shell created a hole 1‚Äì1.5 m in diameter and 40‚Äì60 cm deep in average soil. The shrapnel shell contained more than 600 bullets, and covered an area about 800 m long and 45‚Äì50 m wide.Shunkov - The Weapons of the Red Army. { border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 style=\\"margin:0 0 .5em 1em;

He was from the Egerton family. Biography Egerton was the eldest son of the Right Reverend John Egerton, Bishop of Durham, and the grandson of the Right Reverend Henry Egerton, Bishop of Hereford, youngest son of John Egerton, 3rd Earl of Bridgewater. His mother was Lady Anne Sophia Grey. He joined the British Army in 1771 and was promoted to captain in 1776, to major in 1779, and to lieutenant-colonel in 1790. He was promoted to colonel of 7th Light Dragoons in 1793, but in 1797 transferred to be Colonel of 14th Light Dragoons, serving under Major-general Craufurd during the Peninsular War to great acclaim. He remained colonel of the 14th Dragoons for the rest of his life and was promoted major-general in 1795, lieutenant-general in 1802 and full general in 1812. cites Egerton also sat as a Tory Member of Parliament for Morpeth from 1777 to 1780 and for Brackley from 1780 to 1803. The latter year, on the death of his first cousin once removed, Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, he succeeded as seventh Earl of Bridgewater. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1808. and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (F.S.A.) on 4 February 1808. Lord Bridgewater died in October 1823, aged 70. On 14 January 1783 he had married Charlotte Catherine Anne (died 1849 aged 85 cites ), only daughter and heir of Samuel Haynes. Their marriage was childless, and therefore his younger brother Francis inherited the title of Earl of Bridgewater. Egerton left his estates in Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Cheshire, Durham, Flintshire, Hertfordshire, Middlesex, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, Shropshire and Yorkshire to John, Viscount Alford, provided he had managed to become Duke or Marquess of Bridgwater with a suitable remainder. John did not fulfil the proviso in the will, failing in court to persuade the judge. However his heir got the clause declared illegal, so the 2nd Earl Brownlow commenced a damaging and lengthy case of litigation that in 1851 resulted in the Egerton family forfeiting the estates. Monuments and memorials Memorial to the 7th Earl of Bridgewater and Charlotte Anne in the Bridgewater Chapel at St. Peter and St. Paul Church, Little Gaddesden, where many Egerton family members are buried Lord Bridgewater is commemorated by a memorial at the Bridgewater Chapel at St. Peter and St. Paul Church, Little Gaddesden. In the early 17th century, Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley, had purchased Ashridge House, one of the largest country houses in England, from Queen Elizabeth I, who had inherited it from her father who had appropriated it after the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539. Ashridge House served the Egerton family as a residence until the 19th century. The Egertons later had a family chapel with burial vault in Little Gaddesden Church, where many monuments commemorate the Dukes and Earls of Bridgewater and their families.

The racial makeup of the school was 100% African American. History Callaway High School, named after former educator Robert M. Callaway, was built in 1966. Robert, a Lafayette County native, began his career teaching Choctaw Indians in the mountains of McCurtain County, Oklahoma. Before assuming duties as principal of Liberty Grove School, later H.V.

In the 2009‚Äì10 season, after the graduation of Noble to SEC's Arkansas, the Mighty Chargers led by Smith rallied to win the 5A state championship. 1975 Big Eight Conference State title In the 1975 football season Callaway High School won the Big Eight Conference State title. The 1975 Callaway team was the first Big Eight team in the state of Mississippi to record a 12‚Äì0 record, it is also the last team in over 50 years from the Jackson Mississippi metro area to go undefeated and rank as the No.1 team in the state. The coach, Charles A. Allman, was chosen Coach of the Year for Metro Jackson three times, and Coach of the Year in 5-A Football for Callaway in 1977 by the MAC. His teams at Callaway had a 33-game winning streak in the '70s. Team member Tyrone Keys (All-American Mississippi State, and player on the 1985 Super Bowl Champion, Chicago Bears) once stated that the entire defense on the 1975 Callaway defense could have played in the SEC. The offense was also one of the tops in the state that year and produced several players that received football scholarships. A book has been written by team member Jerome Gentry to discuss the 1975 team and that time period at Callaway. The book, Mississippi‚Äôs Uncovered Glory, tells the story about the unity of black and white team members working together to create a powerful bond of achievement. The team included Roy Coleman the first black quarterback to play at Ole Miss, but he was far from the only star on the team as several players went on to have success in both college and the NFL. Mississippi‚Äôs Uncovered Glory also sheds light on how black families lived in Mississippi during the late 1960s and early 1970s and dispels some of the negative perceptions of growing up in Jackson at that time.

He spent most of his career performing in New York City, juggling concurrent performance contracts with both the New York City Opera (NYCO) and the Metropolitan Opera during the 1970s and 1980s. In the latter part of his career he was particularly active with the New York Grand Opera. Possessing a lyric tenor voice with a bright timbre and easy upper extension, Di Giuseppe excelled in the Italian repertory. He was particularly successful in tackling the bel canto repertoire, notably partnering Beverly Sills in productions of Donizetti's Anna Bolena, Maria Stuarda, and Roberto Devereux, as well as Bellini's I puritani at the NYCO. Di Giuseppe performed in similar repertoire at the Met opposite other notable bel canto interpreters like Dame Joan Sutherland, Marilyn Horne and Renata Scotto. Early life and career Di Giuseppe was born in Philadelphia in 1932. His first musical experience was with the clarinet, which he played in school. As a youth, he enjoyed singing with others on street corners and one day a local man heard him singing and asked if he would sing a song at his wedding. Enrico agreed to this. The day of the wedding, Enrico showed up and found the groom. He was escorted on stage to sing with the band. He had prepared the traditional wedding song \\"Because\\", but he had never sung with it with accompaniment before. When he came in after the intro, he knew that something was terribly wrong (he later realized he had started an octave higher than where it was written). After the first couple lines, he stopped singing and walked off the stage. The groom met him before he could leave the wedding and told him to just relax and try it again. Young Enrico agreed to give it another try and the second attempt went perfectly and that was the first time he realized he was destined to be a singer. He attended the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music, where he studied with Richard Bonelli. After service with the United States Army Field Band, he went on to study at The Juilliard School under Hans Heinz. He made his formal debut in the summer of 1959, as the Chevalier des Grieux in Jules Massenet's Manon, with The Experimental Opera Theatre of America (affiliated with the New Orleans Opera Association), conducted by Renato Cellini and directed by Armando Agnini. In 1960 he made his debut with the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company as Rodolfo in Giacomo Puccini's La boh√®me. He sang with the PGOC several more times during the 1960s and 1970s, including portraying Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly (1963), Count Almaviva in Il barbiere di Siviglia (1963, 1975), Cassio in Otello (1964), Alfredo in La traviata (1970), and the title role in Faust (1974).Free Library of Philadelphia: Bound: Philadelphia Grand Opera Company 1955-1974 In 1962 Di Giuseppe made his debut with the San Francisco Opera as Mario Cavaradossi in Puccini's Tosca with Giulia Barrera in the title role and Chester Ludgin as Scarpia. He returned to that house two years later to sing Rodolfo to Lee Venora's Mim√¨.Di Giuseppe&psearchtype;= San Francisco Opera archives Among Di Giuseppe's other early professional opportunities were stints touring with Boris Goldovsky's New England Opera Theater and with the fledgling, and short-lived, Metropolitan Opera National Company (MONC). di Giuseppe worked for the MONC on a 1965 production of Rossini's La Cenerentola, with his wife, soprano Lorna Ceniceros. Lorna was playing the role of Clorinda in the production and Enrico was portraying Ramiro. Working in New York City Di Giuseppe is one of the few opera singers to have had lengthy overlapping careers at both the New York City Opera (NYCO) and at the Metropolitan Opera. He made his NYCO debut in 1965 as Michele in Gian Carlo Menotti's The Saint of Bleecker Street. He returned in 1967 for what was possibly his greatest success, the difficult, \\"tenor-altino\\" role of the Astrologue in Rimsky-Korsakov's The Golden Cockerel, opposite Norman Treigle and Beverly Sills, conducted by Julius Rudel and directed by Tito Capobianco. He would go on to perform twenty-six roles at City Opera over sixteen years, in operas such as The Barber of Seville, The Magic Flute, Der Rosenkavalier, Cavalleria rusticana, Tosca, Manon, Gianni Schicchi, Madama Butterfly, Faust, Capriccio, La traviata, La boh√®me, La Cenerentola, Lucia di Lammermoor, Rigoletto, Un ballo in maschera, Roberto Devereux, Don Giovanni (directed by Frank Corsaro), Maria Stuarda, Anna Bolena, I puritani, La fille du r√©giment, Attila, The Makropulos Case, and Mefistofele. Di Giuseppe's Metropolitan Opera debut took place less than five years after his NYCO debut, in a 1969 concert in Central Park as Alfredo. His first appearance on the actual stage of the Metropolitan Opera House was on January 1, 1970, opposite Martina Arroyo in Madama Butterfly. He was seen there, until 1986, in Cavalleria rusticana, The Barber of Seville, Werther (replacing Franco Corelli), Rigoletto, La fille du r√©giment (opposite Sutherland), La boh√®me, La traviata, Un ballo in maschera, La sonnambula, Faust, L'elisir d'amore, L'italiana in Algeri (with Horne), Der Rosenkavalier, Don Pasquale, Cos√¨ fan tutte, Le si√®ge de Corinthe, Adriana Lecouvreur (opposite Scotto), Samson et Dalila (as The Philistine Man, with Jon Vickers in the name part), and Rigoletto.The Metropolitan Opera Encyclopedia, edited by David Hamilton, Simon and Schuster, 1987. After the mid 1980s, Di Giuseppe was no longer appearing with either City Opera or the Met; he made his final Met appearance in 1986. In the following years, he regularly performed with the New York Grand Opera. Work as a freelance artist While working primarily in New York City, Di Giuseppe did occasionally appear as a guest artist with other opera companies. He mostly was active in the United States, singing with such companies as Baltimore Opera, the Opera Company of Boston, Cincinnati Opera, Dallas Opera, the Houston Grand Opera, and the Pittsburgh Opera among others. In 1973 he made his only appearance with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company as Tonio in La fille du r√©giment opposite Sills as Marie.Free Library of Philadelphia: Box: Phila. Lyric Opera Company: 782.1 P5326p Bal Two [1968-75] He appeared in the Opera Company of Philadelphia's (OCP) very first season in January 1976 as Pinkerton to the Cio-cio-san of Atsuko Azuma. He returned to the OCP once more in 1980 to portray Nadir in Georges Bizet's Les p√™cheurs de perles. Outside of the US, Di Giuseppe made appearances with Ottawa Opera, the Canadian Opera Company, Vancouver Opera, and the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. He also performed the role of Don Jos√© in Ireland in 1984 and made several appearances in operas in Asia from 1983 to 1985.  Trivia  In the Paramount film, Foul Play (1978), a scene from The Mikado was seen. The tenor portrayed Nanki-Poo, and the scene was conducted by Rudel.

It grows to 2 or 3 metres in height and between late summer and early winter (February to August in Australia) it produces orange-red pea- flowers with a yellow centre and red veins. The leaves are hairy and heart- shaped on younger plants and elliptic and more glabrous on older plants, up to 6 cm long and 2.7 cm wide. The species was first formally described by botanist Ferdinand von Mueller and published in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae in 1863. It is the most widespread within the genus, occurring across a large area of Queensland, as well as in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and South Australia. Poisonous attributes The species, like many others within the genus Gastrolobium, contains high levels of fluoroacetate (the active ingredient in the pest control toxin known as 1080) The leaves, seeds and roots are highly poisonous to cattle, sheep, horses and goats. Major livestock losses have been attributed to the plant in Queensland. In 1896, the explorer and gold prospector David Carnegie came across the plant in Western Australia on the return leg of an expedition from Coolgardie to Halls Creek later writing: :All along the banks of the creek splendid green acacia and grass was growing, and a most inviting-looking plant standing some six feet high, with greenish-grey stems and leaves, and a flower not unlike wallflower. Such a place at once suggested camping, and we were proceeding to unload when Godfrey remarked that this pretty plant was very like a most deadly Queensland poison plant; he was not sure; I had never seen it before, nor had Breaden. The risk, however, was too great; it might be poison; I could see the camels eyeing its fresh charms, and it grew in such profusion that all would be devouring it in a few minutes. So we packed up again and moved further on, much to the disgust of the blacks and the animals, for all were very tired. I collected some specimens of this plant; if Godfrey had never been in Queensland we should have been in a tight corner. So toxic is the plant to farmed animals that, following bushfires, cattlemen in north-western Queensland have to move livestock before the heart-leaf emerges from the ashes.

The district rezoning was for a number of reasons such as turning Northwest Middle School into an all IB (International Baccluareate) school and moving all Montessori students into McWillie elementary. The rezoning affected 3,900 students. APAC, which was served at Chastain, Peeples, and Powell middle schools, moved into Bailey and the high school students moved to Callaway High School, Lanier High School and Murrah High School. Bailey Magnet formerly had a Health-Related Professions program that is currently at Murrah High. Academic & Performing Arts Complex (APAC) Academic & Performing Arts Complex (APAC) is open to students who are strong academic achievers and/or who show aptitude for one or more visual or performing arts. There is an application process held each year for entrance into the following school year. *Academics: Eligibility for the academics division is based on grades, standardized tests, entrance tests, and teacher recommendations. Cooperative learning and higher order thinking skills are emphasized. Courses in math, science, language arts and social studies prepare students to take college coursework (Advanced Placement). APAC academic courses are offered for grades 4-5 at Power APAC Elementary; grades 6-8 at Bailey APAC Middle School, and for grades 9-12 at Murrah High School. In October 2002, Jackson Public Schools received a federal grant totaling almost 1 million dollars to increase the number of middle and high school students who complete college-level courses in high school. APAC students use textbooks, skills, and materials above their grade level. *Performing Arts: The performing arts division offers classes in dance, music, theatre arts and visual arts. Students must apply and audition for entry into the program. These courses are offered for grades 4 through 12 are at the Power APAC site. This division of APAC is based on a rigorous written, sequential curriculum taught by artist teachers. Artistically, the objective is to prepare students for the next level in the arts whether university, apprenticeship, or professional experience. APAC Language Arts In APAC Language Arts courses for grades 6-8, students actively engage in the integrated language strands of reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Students work on skills, textbooks and materials that are a grade level ahead of the on-level curriculum, including reading multiple novels and writing frequently. Emphasis is placed on using Standard English in speaking and writing, and on critical analysis of literature across the genres. *Language Arts, Grade 6 APAC *Language Arts, Grade 7 APAC *Language Arts, Grade 8 APAC APAC Math In APAC Math courses grades 6-7, students study all objectives identified for their grade level along with matching, extended objectives from Pre-Algebra and Transition to Algebra, so that they are prepared for Algebra I by grade 8. Students use skills, textbooks, and materials that are ahead of the on-level curriculum. Emphasis is placed on problem solving from daily life and on building a strong foundation of basic computational skills that will be used throughout higher level math courses. *Pre-Algebra, Grade 6 APAC *Algebra Transition, Grade 7 APAC *Algebra I, Grade 8 APAC APAC Science In APAC Science courses for grades 6-8, students actively engage in the integrated science strands of earth, physical and life sciences.

The Ring of O is a specially designed ring which has been worn as a distinctive mark among BDSM practitioners, mainly in continental Europe ‚Äî and especially the German- speaking countries ‚Äî since the 1990s. Its use is relatively widespread within this subculture. Its name derives from the name of the central female character in the classic BDSM novel Story of O (written by Anne Desclos using the name Pauline R√©age), who was a sex slave and wore an analogous ring.  Description in literature  Simplified depiction of the Triskelion ring as described in the original book. The ring mentioned in the BDSM novel Story of O was quite different from what is most commonly known as the \\"Ring of O\\" today. The novel describes the ring as shaped similarly to a signet ring (with a seal disk on top which was relatively large for a woman's ring), made out of dull-gray polished iron, lined with gold on the inside, and with a golden Triskelion on its top area. The ring's symbolic meaning in the novel differs quite a bit from the one commonly used among BDSM practitioners today. In the book, such a ring is worn by a female \\"slave\\" after she has finished her training at Roissy. Those wearing the ring are obliged to be obedient to any man who belongs to the secret society of Roissy (whose emblem is the triskelion), and must allow him to do absolutely everything with them that he pleases. This stands in strong contrast to the ring's meaning today. People indicate by wearing such rings that they are interested in BDSM, and sometimes by the hand they wear it on whether they are a Top or a Bottom; usually left for Bottom, right for Top.  Modern shapes  Female model posed as a Bottom wearing a collar in the design of the Ring of O. The first film adaptation of the novel Story of O showed a design consisting of a cylindrical steel ring with an attached ball holding an even smaller toroidal ring (which could swivel in one direction). This alluded to the leather collar and bracelets, each with a metal ring, that had been locked onto O during her training. The first image of this jewellery design was published in the September issue (No.4) of the German BDSM magazine Schlagzeilen in 1989.  As a collar  The term O Ring is sometimes used to refer to collars as well (contrasting with D-ring collars). In this context it can describe a collar with one large ring for fastening. Collars featuring such rings are often worn by bottoms to indicate that they are in a steady relationship.  Literature  * Kathrin Passig and Ira Str√ºbel: Die Wahl der Qual.

Life = Early life  Fijnje grew up in Haarlem, where his father Jan Fijnje, originally from Harlingen, was also a minister. His parents died in 1763. He studied in Amsterdam, but moved in 1771 to Leiden and came in contact with the Collegiants in Rijnsburg. Fijnje began his career as a Mennonite preacher in Deventer (1774). Then he was called to Delft, where he had already (c.1775) taken up an editorial desk for the \\"Hollandsche Historische Courant\\". Fijnje was probably inspired by the publishing activities and the internationally renowned paper of his wife's family in Leiden, for in November 1775 he had married Emilie Luzac, the publisher's daughter.  Patriots  In January 1783 Fijnje came into conflict with the Prussian ambassador to the Dutch Republic, Friedrich Wilhelm von Thulemeyer, who felt insulted by one of Fijnje's articles in the Courant. Fijnje was forced to apologize by the Delft burgemeesters (as freedom of the press was still limited in the old Republic). Johan Luzac, writing under the pseudonym Attica in Fijnje's Dutch-language paper, therefore warned his brother-in-law to practice more discretion in dealing with his co-worker, the journalist Gerrit Paape, who routinely expounded anti-orangist points of view. In 1783 Fijnje was involved in the foundation of the exercitiegenootschappen. In 1785 he was one of the drafters of the Leids Ontwerp (\\"Leiden Draft\\", a Patriot manifesto), together with Pieter Vreede and Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck, among others. On 21 August 1785 Fijnje - as a delegate - read a revolutionary declaration in the council hall of Delft. Eleven members of the vroedschap were asked to leave, after which eight Patriots could be installed. All this happened without the stadholder's knowledge or consent (necessary under the Regeringsreglementen - \\"Government Regulations\\") , but with the assent of the population, although they apparently remained outside, silent, watching the flying column under the leadership of Adam Gerard Mappa, a type-setter. A baker who sold \\"orange cakes\\" ( a symbol of the Orangist party) was court- martialed and put under house arrest. The exercitiegenootschap took over Delft's ammunition and weapons store (largest in the Republic), where later the army museum was housed for a number of years. Their example was followed in Leiden, Dordrecht, Alkmaar, Hoorn and Monnikendam, even under the threat of a Prussian ultimatum and raid.  Exile in northern France  Wijbo Fijnje was one of the convinced and militant Patriots who were forced to leave the city on 19 September 1787, when the Prussian army occupied Delft. The population of Delft took revenge on the exercitiegenootschap by smashing up a room full of Delftware painted with symbols of freedom, and throwing its contents into a city canal. The Fijnje family went to Antwerp, later to Brussels and finally to Watten (French-Flanders). Johan Valckenaer, Herman Willem Daendels and Mappa rented - on Fijnje's initiative - a castle, on top of a hill. The four families and three bachelors cleaned up the rooms, grew vegetables and played billiards. Wijbo Fijnje remarried with a Frenchwoman, Marie Fran√ßoise Constance T√©nar, after Emilie died in 1788. When the members of the association were accused by the local population of growing and selling grain, the commune was dissolved in 1792. Mappa emigrated to the U.S. and began the first type foundry in New York; Valckenaer moved to Paris.  Batavian Republic  In 1795 Fijnje returned to the Netherlands (after the Batavian Revolution), after which he became a member of the commit√© van waakzaamheid (the Batavian version of the French Committee of Public Safety), chaired the Provisional Representatives of the People of Holland for a while. and - together with Samuel Iperusz Wiselius and professor Theodorus van Kooten - served on the committee for the liquidation of the VOC. In all these posts he took radical viewpoints, but he also enjoyed himself thoroughly. On 22 January 1798, he performed a Coup d'√©tat with general Herman Willem Daendels, Pieter Vreede and Van Langen to guarantee \\"the unity and indivisibility\\" of the Batavian republic. The radical and omnipresent Fijnje represented the Uitvoerend Bewind and founded the \\"Binnenlandse Bataafse Courant\\" (Interior Batavian Courier). The controversial unitarissen did not long remain in power, for on 12 June 1798 general Daendels led another coup, this time putting the \\"moderates\\" in power in the Uitvoerend Bewind. For the corrupt former exiles with explicit opinions, whether democrat or aristocrat, there was no longer any place. Fijnje and Van Langen were locked up until the end of the year in the Gevangenpoort, accused of embezzling state money by the public prosecutor Van Maanen, but never put on trial. Fijnje became a private citizen and busied himself with an old hobby, higher mathematics, and stayed indoors for weeks at a time. On recommendation of Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck, Alexander Gogel and Hendrik van Rays Fijnje became in 1805 editor-in-chief of the \\"Bataafse Staatscourant\\" (Batavian state courier). He got the use of the domain het Kleine Loo . When the editorial office was moved to Amsterdam, Jonas Daniel Meijer was appointed editor-in-chief. Fijnje seems to have been unable through illness to keep up the job, but was kept on as a nominal manager.

Master data management (MDM) allows an organization to discover and define non-transactional lists of data, and compile maintainable, reliable master lists. Master Data Services first shipped with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2. Microsoft SQL Server 2016 introduced enhancements to Master Data Services, such as improved performance and security, and the ability to clear transaction logs, create custom indexes, share entity data between different models, and support for many-to- many relationships. Overview In Master Data Services, the model is the highest level container in the structure of your master data. You create a model to manage groups of similar data. A model contains one or more entities, and entities contain members that are the data records. An entity is similar to a table. Like other MDM products, Master Data Services aims to create a centralized data source and keep it synchronized, and thus reduce redundancies, across the applications which process the data. Sharing the architectural core with Stratature +EDM, Master Data Services uses a Microsoft SQL Server database as the physical data store. It is a part of the Master Data Hub, which uses the database to store and manage data entities. It is a database with the software to validate and manage the data, and keep it synchronized with the systems that use the data. The master data hub has to extract the data from the source system, validate, sanitize and shape the data, remove duplicates, and update the hub repositories, as well as synchronize the external sources. The entity schemas, attributes, data hierarchies, validation rules and access control information are specified as metadata to the Master Data Services runtime. Master Data Services does not impose any limitation on the data model. Master Data Services also allows custom Business rules, used for validating and sanitizing the data entering the data hub, to be defined, which is then run against the data matching the specified criteria. All changes made to the data are validated against the rules, and a log of the transaction is stored persistently. Violations are logged separately, and optionally the owner is notified, automatically. All the data entities can be versioned. Master Data Services allows the master data to be categorized by hierarchical relationships, such as employee data are a subtype of organization data. Hierarchies are generated by relating data attributes. Data can be automatically categorized using rules, and the categories are introspected programmatically. Master Data Services can also expose the data as Microsoft SQL Server views, which can be pulled by any SQL- compatible client. It uses a role-based access control system to restrict access to the data. The views are generated dynamically, so they contain the latest data entities in the master hub. It can also push out the data by writing to some external journals. Master Data Services also includes a web- based UI for viewing and managing the data. It uses SilverLight in the front- end and ASP.NET in the back-end. Master Data Services provides a Web service interface to expose the data, as well as an API, which internally uses the exposed web services, exposing the feature set, programmatically, to access and manipulate the data. It also integrates with Active Directory for authentication purposes. Unlike +EDM, Master Data Services supports Unicode characters, as well as support multilingual user interfaces. SQL Server 2016 introduced a significant performance increase in Master Data Services over previous versions.http://www.faceofit.com/why-is-sql-server-2016-is-faster- than-ever  Terminology  * Model is the highest level of an MDS instance. It is the primary container for specific groupings of master data. In many ways it is very similar to the idea of a database. * Entities are containers created within a model. Entities provide a home for members, and are in many ways analogous to database tables. (e.g. Customer) * Members are analogous to the records in a database table (Entity) e.g. Will Smith. Members are contained within entities. Each member is made up of two or more attributes. * Attributes are analogous to the columns within a database table (Entity) e.g. Surname. Attributes exist within entities and help describe members (the records within the table). Name and Code attributes are created by default for each entity and serve to describe and uniquely identify leaf members. Attributes can be related to other attributes from other entities which are called 'domain-based' attributes. This is similar to the concept of a foreign key. Other attributes however, will be of type 'free-form' (most common) or 'file'. * Attribute Groups are explicitly defined collections of particular attributes. Say you have an entity \\"customer\\" that has 50 attributes -- too much information for many of your users. Attribute groups enable the creation of custom sets of hand-picked attributes that are relevant for specific audiences. (e.g. \\"customer - delivery details\\" that would include just their name and last known delivery address). This is very similar to a database view. * Hierarchies organize members into either Derived or Explicit hierarchical structures. Derived hierarchies, as the name suggests, are derived by the MDS engine based on the relationships that exist between attributes. Explicit hierarchies are created by hand using both leaf and consolidated members. * Business Rules can be created and applied against model data to ensure that custom business logic is adhered to. In order to be committed into the system data must pass all business rule validations applied to them. e.g. Within the Customer Entity you may want to create a business rule that ensures all members of the 'Country' Attribute contain either the text \\"USA\\" or \\"Canada\\". The Business Rule once created and ran will then verify all the data is correct before it accepts it into the approved model. * Versions provide system owners / administrators with the ability to Open, Lock or Commit a particular version of a model and the data contained within it at a particular point in time. As the content within a model varies, grows or shrinks over time versions provide a way of managing metadata so that subscribing systems can access to the correct content.

Ferguson was co-founder of Ferguson Mann Architects in 1979, where regeneration and historic building work formed the foundation of the practice. He was also founder of the national architectural group Acanthus. He is a past president of the Royal Institute of British Architects (2003‚Äì2005) where \\"he was noted for championing the causes of education, the environment and good urbanism\\". He was a founding director of The Academy of Urbanism and a founding member of the British sustainable transport charity Sustrans. Ferguson was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours for services to architecture, and to the community in the South West of England. In November 2012, Ferguson became the first elected mayor of Bristol. He was a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers before stepping down due to conflict of interests on becoming Mayor of Bristol. Early life Ferguson was born on 22 March 1947, in the city of Winchester, in Hampshire. His father's military career took the family to Gibraltar, to the South and North of England and to Norway prior to settling in Wiltshire. While in Gibraltar, Ferguson contracted infant polio. Education Ferguson was educated at Wellington College. Ferguson read architecture at the University of Bristol from 1965 to 1971. Ferguson has been awarded honorary degrees from the University of Bristol and the University of the West of England. Apart from one year in London, Ferguson has lived in Bristol since beginning his degree in 1965. Career in architecture Urban renewal and environmental sustainability were central elements of Ferguson's approach to design, exemplified by developments such as the Tobacco Factory. In 1978, Ferguson co-founded Ferguson Mann Architects and the practice won many awards for design. In 1986, Ferguson founded Acanthus, a network of independent practices committed to design and conservation. During his career, Ferguson has written and presented articles, broadcasts and lectures on planning and architectural matters and sustainability, and appeared on the 2005 Channel 4 television series Demolition. Ferguson fully stepped down from Ferguson Mann Architects after his election as Mayor of Bristol in order to concentrate on his new role within the city. In December 2014, the Architects Registration Board investigated George Ferguson for using the protected title 'Architect' without being registered to do so under the Architects Act 1997. He admitted he had deliberately let his membership lapse and removed the term from his social media status. Regeneration in South Bristol The Tobacco Factory during cleaning work which saw a Union Flag covering scaffolding Ferguson is noted for his role in the regeneration of the Bedminster area of South Bristol. In 1994, he bought the last remaining major building of the old Imperial Tobacco Raleigh Road estate for ¬£200,000 to save it from demolition and regenerate it. The site, now named the Tobacco Factory, is a mixed-use development that includes the Tobacco Factory Theatre, bar, creative industry workspace and flats. In 2003, Ferguson bought part of the long-closed Ashton Gate Brewery. The Bristol Beer Factory began brewing beer on the site in 2005 and has won national awards. In 2018 Ferguson moved back to Clifton, having lived in the Tobacco Factory for a number of years. Politics City Hall, College Green Ferguson was one of the first three Liberal Councillors to be elected to Bristol City Council, representing Cabot Ward from 1973 to 1979. He stood unsuccessfully for the Liberals in the 1983 and 1987 general elections in Bristol West, after which he ceased any active political involvement. In March 2012, Ferguson confirmed speculation that he was planning to stand as an independent candidate for Mayor of Bristol if the referendum on 3 May chose to adopt the mayoral system. Following the referendum, Ferguson resigned his membership from the Liberal Democrat party before announcing that he would stand for mayor, but explained that he had no intention to run as a party candidate. Ferguson ran as an independent but registered his ‚ÄòBristol 1st‚Äô party to distinguish himself from other independents on the ballot paper. In his campaign material, Ferguson stated \\"My only purpose is to make Bristol, the city I love, a better city for all. I have no political ambition beyond Bristol\\" and he set out his seven visions for Bristol. Ferguson campaigned on a platform of anti-political parties, often alleging voting for a Labour candidate would be a return to party in- fighting. The election was held on 15 November 2012. On 16 November 2012, Ferguson was declared Bristol's first elected mayor, beating the second-place Labour candidate Marvin Rees by more than 6,000 votes including second preference votes. The election saw a low turnout of just 27.92% of the electorate participating. Mayor of Bristol Ferguson was sworn in as the first directly elected mayor of Bristol in the Passenger Shed at Bristol Temple Meads station on 20 November 2012. On his first day of taking office, Ferguson implemented two policies, revoking Sunday car parking charges and announcing that the ‚ÄòCouncil House‚Äô, the administrative seat of Bristol, would be renamed ‚ÄòCity Hall'. Ferguson appointed a \\"rainbow cabinet\\" comprising a deputy and five assistant mayors, drawn from four of the main political parties. He also appointed two youth mayors following a citywide election by the youth community. Ferguson took a portion of his salary as mayor in the local Bristol Pound. The salary of the Mayor of Bristol was aligned with the salary of a UK Member of Parliament in 2013, and has not risen despite independent recommendations and a 10% increase in MP's pay to ¬£74,000. Ferguson's tenure as Mayor of Bristol came to an end in May 2016 When he was voted out of office in a landslide vote. Ferguson polled only one third of the total votes, including second preferences, against Marvin Rees who secured two thirds. Public finances One of Ferguson's first challenges on election was to cut ¬£35 million from the 2013/14 budget and plan for a further ¬£65 million in spending cuts over the following three years as part of central Government austerity measures. Most of the savings in the 2013/14 budget (approximately ¬£20 million) were achieved through cuts and changes in council staffing. Over the next 12 months, the challenge had increased to cutting ¬£90 million. Ferguson proposed to achieve most of the savings through staffing cuts and other efficiencies within the council. Several cuts proposed in the 2014-2017 draft budget generated feedback, such as a proposal to discontinue staff supervision at Hengrove Park. Following the 2014‚Äì2017 Bristol city council budget public consultation, Ferguson and the Council removed some of the proposed changes. Ferguson's management of the public purse has been controversial. Following his term an independent report, the Bundred Report, identified that there were substantial savings of over ¬£29 million that had been falsely accounted by his administration, and that Ferguson had presided over serious \\"leadership failures\\" that had led to a shortfall in city budgets. Kerry McCarthy MP brought the issue to national attention at Prime Minister's Questions where she described the \\"abject failure by the previous mayor [George Ferguson] to get a grip on council finances.\\" Police confirmed that they had received complaints of fraud over Ferguson's budgets in the lead-up to the 2016 Mayoral election, and suspicion that the true state of the Council finances had been deliberately covered up to aid Ferguson's chances of reelection. Questions were raised in the national press over Ferguson's role as mayor on the boards of several Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs). Criticism was made of the awarding of considerable sums of public money from those LEPs to companies Ferguson owned. On leaving office, the incoming administration declared ¬£30million of savings had not been made and an independent report called the Bundred Report, found a \\"collective failure of leadership\\" had existed at the council on financial matters. Traffic and transport Ferguson had expressed his determination to tackle traffic congestion by trying to force a change in the city's culture and get people out of cars and onto buses or bicycles. = Residents Parking Zones (RPZ) = In March 2013, Ferguson announced plans to expand existing Residents Parking Zones across the city, in order to reduce the number of commuters driving into the city. The plans were scaled back in June 2013 following public consultation and \\"heavy criticism\\". Ferguson made changes to new schemes to reflect feedback from the public, including introducing a traders permit and making the first 30 minutes free in all new areas. Ferguson has maintained that his RPZ proposals enjoy a high level of support from the \\"quiet majority\\". However, in January 2015, the council's own statistics revealed that over 90% of Clifton respondents in a request for feedback had objected to his plans. Ferguson's plan to expand Residents Parking Zones (RPZ) across the city was highly contentious. The roll-out was beset by protests in several districts of the City where streets in Easton and Montpellier were barricaded to prevent the implementation. The project infrastructure, ticket machines and painted lines have also been widely vandalised costing an estimated ¬£30,000 in repairs. =Speed limits= Mayor Ferguson spearheaded the roll-out of a ¬£2.3m programme of 20 mph limits across the city, following pilots in Bedminster and east Bristol in 2010. In November 2014, Councillors passed a motion calling on Ferguson to give Neighbourhood Partnerships the power to decide on 20 mph limits for their communities. In February 2015, Ferguson was caught breaking the speed limit in a Bristol City Council fleet car whilst driving at 35 mph in a 30 mph area on a journey from Avonmouth along the Portway. He went on record saying it was \\"a stupid mistake\\" and apologised for it. He stated \\"Speed limits are there for a good purpose. We should respect them, and I do respect them.\\" He was later mocked on the popular BBC Two television show Top Gear. = Metrobus = Metrobus, previously Bristol Rapid Transit (BRT), is a scheme developed jointly by the West of England Partnership: a partnership between Bristol City, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire Councils. In development from 2006 it received government backing in November 2013. During the Mayoral election campaign, George Ferguson pledged to cancel the proposed BRT scheme if he was elected. When he came to office, Ferguson made minor amendments to route proposals rather than cancelling the project. In July 2013, Ferguson announced that surrounding local authorities had approved the changes he'd proposed to the route of the planned BRT2 to avoid it running through the Bristol Harbourside area. The system, renamed Metrobus, was also changed to use modern low emission vehicles which were later dropped as a cost-cutting measure. However, protest groups who challenged the route, cost, and feasibility of the scheme accused Ferguson of breaking the electoral promises laid out before his election. A second challenge to Ferguson's support of the Metrobus project came when the next phase was submitted for planning consent in March 2014. Objections to the application were raised over the proposed felling of a large number of mature trees, to the loss of Grade 1 agricultural land at Stapleton that Ferguson had previously promised in his election manifesto to protect, the damage to the setting of Grade 1 Listed Stoke Park house and Grade 2 Registered historic landscape surrounding it, and the lack of public consultation over the proposals. Following the approval of the scheme in August 2014 work began in January 2015 causing further protest, and activists set up camp in trees the council were about to fell. Ferguson's support for the project remained resolute. With Bristol's status as European Green Capital in 2015, Ferguson reiterated his support for the scheme and referred to the developing protest as \\"a challenging situation\\" and claimed he had \\"done more than anyone to minimise the environmental effects of the Metrobus project\\". Protesters attended a press event at which Ferguson was present with Government Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss planting the 1 millionth tree of the national Big Tree Plant programme. At it, he accused the protesters of \\"blowing this issue out of all proportion\\". City branding and international travel Ferguson has referred to Bristol as a 'brand' and himself as \\"Bristol's Brand manager\\". While continuing promotion of green and public transport options, Ferguson has been criticised for the number of foreign trips that he took in his role as mayor. Concerns over the size of his carbon footprint, and the use of public funds for the trips were levelled at the him. During a twelve-month period from January to December 2014, Ferguson and his entourage took sixteen international flights amounting to a carbon footprint of 6.5tons and George Ferguson's international travel as Bristol Mayor exceeded that of London's mayor Boris Johnson in the same period. Sale of Bristol Port Royal Portbury Dock In March 2014, Ferguson expressed his intention to sell the freehold ownership of Avonmouth and Portbury docks which had been retained by the city council since the leasehold was sold in 1991. Controversy surrounded the sale from the beginning due to the connections between Ferguson and the Bristol Port Company's directors through their past and current membership of the private group the Society of Merchant Venturers. On 1 April 2014 Ferguson decided to make the sale based on the offered sum of ¬£10 million. However, elected councillors called-in the decision for debate citing the lack of transparency over the sale, lack of information provided by the Mayor, and a \\"one-sided\\" valuation of the estate. On 1 June 2015, Councillors debated the \\"flawed\\" and \\"suspicious\\" sale and the Mayor was told to reconsider it. Ferguson refused and continued announced the sale of the port land \\"with immediate effect\\" at a Cabinet meeting on 16 June 2015. At the same meeting, the Assistant Mayor with responsibility for property and transport, Mark Bradshaw, spoke out against the immediate sale and asked that Ferguson postpone it pending further information. Ferguson sacked Bradshaw from his cabinet position by email later the same evening. Ferguson denied accusations that he'd sacked Bradshaw for opposing his wishes or being a threat to his hoped re-election and claimed Bradshaw had \\"started to use the cabinet and his position as a political stage for his own ambition\\". Days before the 2016 Mayoral elections on 5 May it transpired that Ferguson had covered up the potential of oil shale gas (fracking) on the Avonmouth port estate cited ‚Äúmajor embarrassment‚Äù if it was revealed after the sale and an obstacle in getting councillor's approval for the sale. Ferguson wrote to the port stating their pursuant of an extraction licence ‚Äúvery unfortunately, in any case, complicate(s) the proposed freehold sale and would cause me major embarrassment if it went ahead in its present form.‚Äù Port Company executives agreed, stating that: ‚Äúwe always recognise potential for embarrassment around shale gas extraction‚Äù. It remained unclear whether any protection of the area has been negotiated. European Green Capital In March 2013, Ferguson led a delegation from Bristol to Brussels to present Bristol's bid to be European Green Capital 2015 and three months later it was announced that Bristol had won. Bristol received a ¬£7 Million grant from the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) to support the year-long event, and the Council approved a further ¬£1 Million of its own funds for the same. An arms-length company was formed to organise the events for the year - Bristol 2015 Ltd - of which George Ferguson became a director. Andrew Garrad,https://www.dnvgl.com/news/andrew-garrad-to-retire-from-dnv-gl-82913 who'd been the second largest donor to George Ferguson's election campaign, was elected by the Bristol 2015 Boardhttps://www.bristol2015.co.uk/about/organisation/board-profiles to the unpaid post of Chair. Garrad remained a member of the same private group The Society of Merchant Venturers from whom Ferguson had stood down from shortly after the election. In December 2014, the proposed recipients of Bristol's Green Capital Strategic Grants were announced. Grants were awarded by Bristol 2015 Ltd on the recommendation of a panel which contained neither members of the Board nor employees of the company. 136 groups applied for funding, only 32 were accepted, 10 of which Bristol 2015 board members managed or worked for and accounted for ¬£500,000 of the total grants made. A company called Playing Out CIC, of which Ferguson's daughter is Managing Director, received ¬£41,000 raising questions about the public accountability of Bristol 2015 Ltd, and apparent conflicts of interest between its directors, employees, and outside organisations. In total Bristol 2015 supported 204 projects in the city through various grants.Review of Bristol European Green Capital 2015.‚Äù Bristol City Council Report to BCC Overview and Management Board. In November 2015 Sustainable Shaun, the online game created by Aardman and Bristol 2015 Ltd, won an industry leading TIGA Award for best 'Game with a Purpose'.http://www.bristol247.com/channel/business/news-3/awards/sustainable- shaun-wins-industry-prize It is now being played in 171 countries and has been translated into 24 languages. Concerns continued over Bristol 2015 Ltd's management of the ¬£8 Million of public money. As the Limited Company had no legal requirement to publish its accounts, and refused to do so, concerns were raised with Mr Ferguson, as mayor and a company director. It was stated that there was a lack of transparency in how funds had been spent, and how certain elements, such as a web site that cost almost a quarter of a million pounds, had been procured and managed. In addition to the money spent by Bristol 2015 Ltd it later transpired that the city had paid a further ¬£29,000 in hotel bills for the mayor and executive council officers for attendance at the COP21 climate change conference in Paris which was a requirement of the DECC grant.https://www.bristol.gov.uk/documents/20182/33519/Annex+B+DECC+Proposed+Memorandum+of+Understanding1.pdf At the closing ceremony on 5 February 2016 protesters calling for the publication of the accounts were branded \\"lunatics\\" by Mr Ferguson, and, although still refusing to make the full spending public, claimed \\"I have nothing to hide\\". He later dismissed the debate about the use of the ¬£8 million as a \\"fuss about the cost of sandwiches\\". A detailed report https://www.bristol2015.co.uk/citywide-review/ ‚ÄúIt Doesn't Stop Here! A City- Wide Review‚Äù on Bristol's year as European Green Capital was published by Bristol 2015 Ltd in February 2016. After his election in May 2016 Mayor Rees announced, in his swearing-in speech,://www.bristolpost.co.uk/bristol-mayor- marvin-rees-swearing- speech/story-29249086-detail/story.html#9bgz247xuig3UCfV.99 that he would commission an independent review of the European Green Capital. Stephen Bundred,://www.policyconnect.org.uk/hec/people/steve-bundred a retired senior civil servant who had been Chief Executive of the Audit Commission, was appointed in October 2016 to undertake the review. His report was published in January 2017.://www.bristol.gov.uk/documents/20182/1352057/European+Green+Capital+Review+report/f7ae017a-57b5-4bc0-acdf-a1ed61380a35 Bundred concludes ‚ÄúThe bottom line is that measured against the task that it was given, it is impossible to reach any other conclusion than that Bristol 2015 Ltd performed well and the Green Capital year was a considerable success.‚Äù In January 2017 Mayor Rees summarised his own view Bristol Post Tuesday January 10, 2017 of Bristol's European Green Capital as ‚Äúan undoubted success with a few bumps in the road‚Äù. Bristol Green Capital Partnership ://bristolgreencapital.org/ which was strengthened and re-structured during 2015 by a specific grant will now carry on the legacy work. In 2015 Bristol Energy, a municipally owned energy supply company, was founded. It was seen as \\"a new model of energy company that contributes to the wellbeing of local communities\\", and was intended to support local renewable energy generators and reinvest profits back into Bristol council services. The company began taking customers in February 2016. Bristol Arena The prioritisation of an entertainment arena for Bristol, building on the efforts of previous administrations, was one of Ferguson's central pledges of his mayoral campaign. The proposal was approved as part of Bristol City Council's budget in February 2014 and the 12,000 capacity venue on the site of the former Bristol Bath Road depot was expected to open in 2017. The bulk of funding came as a loan of ¬£53 million from the City Deal to be repaid by the retention of business rates arising from regeneration, via the West of England Local Enterprise Partnership, while the council will loan a further ¬£38 million to be financed by the lease to the operator. The costs involved in the project spiralled from ¬£80m when it was first proposed by Ferguson, to ¬£92.5m by October 2015, a 16% increase in budget, and the proposed opening delayed until 2018. By 17 September 2015 the project's cost had risen to ¬£94m. It was also revealed that the 12,000 capacity arena would be provided with not more than 45 car parking spaces. In October 2015 Ferguson had remarked that only a \\"stupid city\\" would invest in arena car parking, but four months later his officers put forward plans for an 8-storey 500-space car park to serve it. In March 2016 Ferguson's plans suffered a further setback when the city's planning committee described the proposals as \\"defective\\". The committee, who hold an impartial and quasi-judicial responsibility under planning law, deferred making a decision until an appropriate level of supporting information could be provided. It was stated the scheme had been \\"rushed\\" to try to get it approved during Ferguson's re-election campaign, public concern over parking and transport around the proposals had not been properly addressed, and the committee were not confident in the detail submitted for approval. Ferguson expressed himself as angry and outraged at the majority decision of the committee. His accusations that the planning committee were \\"playing politics\\" united cross-party condemnation, and it was declared as unhelpful of the mayor to \\"display such public acts of pique\\" over the considered judgements of the committee. Prior to the cancellation of the arena project in September 2018 and in one of a number of public interventions, Ferguson authored a scathing letter to Bristol 24/7 in which he accused his successor Marvin Rees of breaking 'all seven principles of public life' in his conduct regarding the decision. The City Deal In March 2014, Ferguson, together with the leaders of the three surrounding authorities that form the West of England, agreed a ‚ÄòCity Deal‚Äô with Government. This would allow Bristol to retain income from business rates and decide how the money should be spent. In the past business rates were kept by Government to be distributed nationally. However, in January 2015, with Bristol City Council still to sign a deal with other local authorities, Ferguson launched an alternative partnership for a City Region with the cities of Cardiff and Newport in Wales. Rejecting the previous partnership negotiated with the city's neighbouring Local Authorities he stated \\"I like to move at the pace of the fastest, not the slowest\\". More than a year later, in February 2016, surrounding Local authorities had still not been consulted on the \\"Great Western Cities Plan\\" leading to concerns that Ferguson was jeopardising devolution discussions with government. The Deputy Leader of neighbouring North Somerset Council, Elfan Ap Rees, said \\"We're in the middle of trying to sort out the devolution deal to our benefit for the West of England and here's the mayor (George Ferguson) trotting off to do something entirely different. It's ridiculous.\\" Festivals Ferguson introduced ‚ÄòMake Sunday Special‚Äô, an idea borrowed from Bordeaux, one of Bristol's twin cities. On selected Sundays in the summer, some roads in the city centre are closed to motor vehicles and various entertainments or events are laid on. This initiative ended simultaneously with the end of Ferguson's tenure. Ferguson is currently Patron of Circus City - Bristol's Biennial Circus Festival. A flagship event on the city's cultural calendar, Circus City spans 3‚Äì4 weeks, and hosts 80+ events in 15+ venues across the city, with the aim of promoting Bristol as an international capital of contemporary circus arts. Public image Ferguson wearing his trademark red trousers. Ferguson is a self-proclaimed 'establishment rebel' and has stated that his well-known trademark red trousers signify this. He has been described at \\"larger than life\\", and his leadership style has been described positively as \\"decisive\\", but conversely as \\"arrogant\\" and \\"high handed\\". Research undertaken by Bristol University demonstrated increased visibility of city governance under the mayoral model, but revealed citizens felt unrepresented and concerned about how decisions were being taken. Several incidents have occurred during Ferguson's tenure as mayor that have received widespread media coverage and affected his public image. Ferguson himself acknowledged the issues in an interview with the BBC in January 2016 and sought to highlight the positive change the mayoral model had brought about. During the run-up to the Mayoral Election, in September 2012, Ferguson had been forced to apologise for suggesting some ways of developing the city may be \\"too Irish\\", a derogatory term implying that they were ludicrous or illogical. In May 2013, Ferguson was caught on camera using a four-letter expletive directed at a member of public, 27-year-old citizen Paul Saville, at a public event in Bristol city centre. George Ferguson later accused him of stalking and refused to apologise for the insult saying he \\"was not sorry\\". The event drew local and UK national media coverage, including the BBC, and quickly generated a series of T-shirts parodying the words he'd used. The following month the leader of the Conservative group of city councillors made an official complaint to the City Director about a \\"foul mouthed\\" outburst from the mayor. In a short exchange Mr Ferguson was reported to have used a four-letter word several times; an incident that sparked further media interest. On 7 January 2015, after a Bristol motorist posted a \\"joke\\" comment on social media implying that he had driven off after hitting a cyclist, Mr Ferguson commented that his Tweet \\"has chilling echoes of 60's Deep South racism\\". The following day, he was forced to apologise following public criticism of the comparison. In his defence in January 2016, Ferguson claimed \\"Occasionally I may have lost my rag with people....it may have been once a year....but it gets repeated and repeated and that becomes my image.\\" In the same interview Ferguson tackled public perceptions of his \\"dictatorial\\" nature and pledged to be \\"more consensual\\" if he were re-elected. However, he failed to win re-election. Private life George Ferguson and his wife Lavinia separated in 2000 following a well publicised affair with a BBC journalist, Helen Reed, although they remain married. They have three grown children. Ferguson has been involved in several local charities including the Avon Youth Association, Cruse, and Starfish. He is also a trustee of the University of Bristol Union. Ferguson was appointed High Sheriff of Bristol when that office was revived in 1996 and served for one year. He was also previously a board member of the think tank Demos, a trustee of the Arnolfini Arts Centre, and was formerly a member of the private charitable organisation The Society of Merchant Venturers.

Professional wrestling career He began training in April 1991 and started putting up rings and taking photographs for promoter Max Crabtree. He made his professional debut in June 1991 at Whitby, Yorkshire, at the young age of 14. He wrestled extensively in and around Europe for the following ten years working as many as 10 shows a week for various promoters. In 1997, Knight travelled to Germany and France and a tour of the Middle East. The following year, he worked for numerous promoters on a full-time basis and made a short tour of Belgium. In 1999, he worked on British television for Ultimate Wrestling Alliance (UWA), the first nationally televised wrestling show in Britain in over 10 years, and was crowned UWA television champion in June of that year. He also wrestled a match for the UWA in a three-way with Doug Williams and Kerry Cabrero. He wrestled in the United States of America for 12 weeks in late 1999, picking up extra bookings and the offer of work in Puerto Rico. While living in America was a guest trainer at the Jimmy Valiant wrestling camp. In 2000, he cut back on wrestling schedule due to a neck injury suffered in the US when the ring collapsed after a move of the top rope. Knight needed surgery to remove fragment of bones from his spinal column. In April 2000, he opened up the \\"Steve Knight School of Wrestling\\". In June 2003, after having intense physical therapy returned to wrestling with numerous promoters and was soon wrestling 3 ‚Äì 4 times a week for numerous British promoters and was crowned BCW Champion on 5 December 2003 in Kilmarnock, by defeating Drew Galloway, who was declared champion the same night. Frontier Wrestling Alliance Knight worked with the Frontier Wrestling Alliance (FWA) from 2003 to 2006. On 2 August 2003, Knight ‚Äì who had recently made a comeback to the ring after injury - won the FWA Tag Team Championship with Alex Shane at the Dome in Morecambe. The title reign was short-lived as Knight and Shane dropped the belts back to The Family two days later at his home ground of Cleethorpes. Knight became a regular with the FWA as a heel, appearing at Hotwired 2003 and as a guest ring announcer at FWA British Uprising 2 on 18 October 2003, where he insulted female wrestler Nikita. This led to false speculation that Knight was the wrestler who had placed a bounty on Nikita's head. They had a one-on-one match in Morecambe on 29 May 2004, which he lost by clean pinfall. In July 2004, Knight began a quest to win back the tag team title, which saw him try out various partners including Dirk Feelgood. He eventually settled on Mark Sloan. The Knight-Sloan tag team came to an end after they lost to Hampton Court on 13 November 2004, at the Coventry SkyDome at British Uprising 3. In 2005, Knight embarked on a quest to win the FWA British Flyweight Title, even though his ground-based 'old school' brawling and scientific wrestling style were not exactly the typical lucha libre style used by most flyweight wrestlers. In several matches, Knight would precariously try to climb to the top rope to attempt a moonsault, only to think better of it when the fans chanted: \\"You can‚Äôt do it!‚Äù Knight's quest flopped as he was pinned by newcomer Stevie Lynn at War on the Shore on 26 March 2005. On 18 March 2005, he teamed with long-time friend Doug Williams in a match with Mitsuharu Misawa and Yoshinari Ogawa for BCW in Carluke, Scotland. The following day at TWC International Showdown, an event that drew 3,500 fans to the Coventry SkyDome, Knight teamed with Stixx and Mark Sloan to lose to Jack Xavier, Aviv Maayan and Ross Jordan. On 18 June 2005, Knight turned 'babyface' after he tried to retire from wrestling, only to be challenged to an FWA Title match by his former partner Alex Shane, which Knight lost. He agreed to continue his career for one more match, and beat Shane in a non-title lumberjack match back at The Dome on 30 July 2005. After this bout, Knight was attacked by a face from his past, a former opponent from the 1990s, Johnny Angel. On 4 March 2006 Knight made a surprise return to the FWA and attacked Johnny Angel at War On The Shore 2. He and Angel were then the final two in the Gold Rush rumble only for All-Star Wrestling's Five Star Flash to interfere, meaning Knight and Angel were co-winners. Afterward, Flash and Robbie Brookside attacked Knight. On 13 May 2006 Knight captained FWA to reclaim the Cup from Brookside's ASW squad, although Knight himself tapped out to Brookside in a Survivor-style elimination match due to an ankle injury. Knight resumed his feud with Johnny Angel and they wrestled at Cleethorpes on 23 September 2006 and at Worcester on 19 November 2006. The feud was decided in an 'I Quit' match at Morecambe on 3 February 2007 when Knight lost, the referee stopping the match after Knight was knocked cold by an Angel tombstone piledriver and had to be helped from the ring. XWA The FWA changed its name to the XWA and ran its first show under the new name on 7 April 2007. Knight, who had been omitted from the XWA's team to defend the British Inter- Federation Cup against WAW because XWA owner Greg Lambert was concerned over Knight's various injury problems, turned heel on this show by blasting Darren Burridge with a kendo stick, costing XWA the Cup. Knight received a blistering heel reaction from the Morecambe crowd on 29 June 2007, when he pinned Declan O‚ÄôConnor and declared himself 'Mr Deal Or No Deal'. He then entered a feud with Sam Slam. He and Ricky Knight beat Sam and Darren Burridge by DQ at XWA Last Fight at the Prom on 24 November 2007 in Morecambe. On 2 February 2008 he had a controversial win in the XWA's annual Goldrush 15-man rumble, lastly eliminating Sam Slam (who had earlier thrown Knight over the top rope when officials were distracted by an outside-ring brawl between Jonny Storm and Johnny Phere). Knight challenged Jonny Storm for the British heavyweight title at \\"XWA War on the Shore at The Dome IV\\", Morecambe, on 12 April but failed to win the belt. Although he pinned Storm for a three count, referee Richard Young and ringside enforcer Stixx agreed to restart the match because Knight had illegally thrown powder in Storm's eyes. Storm then pinned Knight after a superkick. On 5 July 2008 Knight was the final survivor in a Final Four elimination match at XWA Vendetta against Sam Slam, Johnny Phere and 'The Wonderkid' Jonny Storm, lastly pinning Storm after a series of piledrivers, becoming the British Heavyweight Champion for the first time. On 6 September 2008, Knight lost the title to Sam Slam and announced retirement. He returned to The Dome for Vendetta 2009 for a farewell match against 'RockStar' Spud and was given an emotional send-off by the XWA roster before going to live in Cyprus. Promoter Having promoted wrestling events since 1994, Knight promoted his biggest show at the KC Arena in Hull, on 2 August 2004 which drew over 1,000 fans. Under the name of IWP, the show was supposed to be headlined by Jake 'The Snake' Roberts, who failed to show up. IWP returned to Hull on 6 November 2004, for a show headlined by D-Lo Brown versus Paul Burchill. In May and June 2005, Knight promoted the FWA's Carnage Tour ‚Äì centred on D-Lo Brown and Joe Legend. The intention was for FWA to run shows at new venues in the Yorkshire area to build up new fan bases for the promotion. Knight was also the regional promoter for several FWA shows at the Winter Gardens in Cleethorpes from 2003 to 2006. Other media In July 2007, Knight appeared on Britain's biggest game show Deal or No Deal (presented by Noel Edmonds) on Channel 4. After serving his time as one of the 'wing' contestants opening the boxes for the main gameplayer, he finally got his chance to play the game and take on the Banker on 29 August 2007. Knight took a Deal at ¬£10,001 but had he played on, would have won ¬£100,000. Where are they now Knight now lives in Cyprus. He occasionally returns to the UK and recently as of this writing held several wrestling seminars.

Early history The first attempts to translate books of the Bible into the modern Russian language of the time took place in the 16th and 17th centuries. However, these works (undertaken by deacon of Posolsky Prikaz Avraamiy Firsov, pastor E. Gluk, and archbishop Methodiy Smirnov), were lost during political turbulence and wars. A full-scale Bible translation into the Russian language began in 1813, after the establishment of the Bible Society in Russia. The full edition of the Bible with both the Old Testament and the New Testament was published in 1876. This work, called the Russian Synodal Bible, is widely used by Protestant and even Catholic communities all over Russia and in the former soviet states, and is also used by many Russian Orthodox adherents for all kinds of teaching and private study, outside of liturgical use (for which the Old Church Slavonic version is preferred). More recently, several modern translations have appeared.The Bible Society in Russia, in Russian The Bible Society in Russia, between its establishment in 1813 and 1826, distributed more than 500,000 Bible-related books in 41 languages of Russia. This early work was led by Dr John Paterson, D.D. (1776 - 1855) a young Scottish Minister. Dr Paterson was granted an ukase to publish bibles by Tsar Alexander I who actively supported the work of the Bible Society in Russia and provided a building beside the Catherine Canal (now Kanala Griboevova) for the Society's use. The work of the Society ended when Nicholas 1 placed the Society under the control of the Holy Synod. Dr Paterson returned to Scotland and lived until 1855 on a pension from Tsar Nicholas. Several times in the 19th and 20th centuries, activities of the Society were stopped by reactionary policies of the Russian Government. Recent history The Society was restored in 1990-1991 after a pause connected with the Soviet regime restrictions.History of The Bible Society in Russia, in Russian The opening ceremony of the Building of the Bible Society in Russia in Moscow was visited by representatives of Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant churches, who joined their efforts in the cause of Bible translation and distribution. The well-known Orthodox priest and theologian Alexander Men was one of the leaders of the refounded institution. The editions of the Society are based on the universal doctrine of the early Christian church and include non-confessional comments. Over 1,000,000 Bible- related books are printed per year by that institution. The Bible is also being translated into native languages and dialects of Russia's ethnic groups. Since 1995, the Bible Society in Russia is a member of the United Bible Societies association.

Some people incorrectly call a Welsh Sheepdog a Welsh Collie - usually 'Welsh Collie' is used for a cross between a Welsh Sheepdog and a Border Collie, who is often a milder dog and easier to manage than the pure breed. Like other types of working dog, Welsh Sheepdogs are normally bred for their herding abilities rather than appearance, and so they are generally somewhat variable in build, colour and size. Welsh Sheepdogs are of collie type, usually black-and-white, red-and-white or tricolour, and merle markings may occur over any of these combinations. The coat may be short or fairly long, and the ears are pricked, but usually folded at the tip. They are longer in leg, broader in chest and wider in muzzle than the Border Collie. They are extremely active and intelligent, and therefore need much exercise and mental stimulation, if they are to be kept as pets. Over many decades the Welsh Sheepdog has largely been replaced for working sheep in Wales by the Border Collie, a standardised breed. However, in more recent years, efforts have been made to maintain the indigenous Welsh Sheepdog as a distinct variety. Welsh Sheepdogs are usually of loose-eyed action, not fixing the stock with their gaze like the ' Border Collie. They are able to work independently without necessarily being under direct human control. Welsh Sheepdogs are most often used for herding sheep, but also readily work cattle, goats, and even horses and pigs. Traditionally they were often used as droving dogs to take cattle and sheep to markets locally or elsewhere in Britain. The Welsh Sheepdog's life span is 12‚Äì15 years.  History  At one time there existed many sheep-herding dogs peculiar to Wales; during the 18th century Welsh drovers taking sheep for sale took with them five or six sheepdogs as \\"herders on the narrow roads, guards against highwaymen, and providers of game on the route\\". These were an early type of Welsh Sheepdog, higher on the leg and more racily built than the modern day breed. However, by the 1940s the group had decreased to two or three breeds only.Hubbard, C. L. B., Dogs In Britain, A Description of All Native Breeds and Most Foreign Breeds in Britain, Macmillan & Co Ltd, 1948. The ancient pure breeds of Black-and-Tan Sheepdog and Welsh Hillman were almost extinct, and were scarcely seen working. The type best known in Wales at that time was mostly descended from the old Black-and-Tan with an infusion of working Border Collie blood. In the 1940s the Welsh Sheepdog was still common throughout the north and central Welsh counties. In herding activities, it did not normally work low to the ground in \\"the showy manner sometimes seen in the work of the working [Border] Collies\\", as British dog fancier C. L. B. Hubbard put it in 1948. It was variable in type; approximately in height, but the weight ranged from the lighter built, leggier dog of North Wales at to the more solid dogs of Glamorganshire and Monmouthshire. There were no dog show classes for the Welsh Sheepdog as it was purely a working breed.  Activities  Welsh Sheepdogs are primarily herding dogs who have a natural ability with large flocks of sheep or cattle. Some have been trained to compete in dog agility trials, obedience, rally obedience, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Welsh Sheepdogs can be trained to compete in stock dog trials.  References  3\\\\.

This borderland formed a buffer zone between Christian Europe and the Ottoman Empire, and the troops were originally raised to defend their homelands against the Ottoman Turks. When there was no danger of war against the Ottomans, the Grenzer regiments were employed by the Habsburgs in other theatres of war, although one battalion of each regiment would always remain guarding the border. Origin Grenzers were the successors to the irregular troops of Pandurs, which were also raised as a militia by the Habsburgs in the 18th century to defend the border with the Ottomans and also used as skirmishers in the Seven Years' War.Haythornthwaite, Philip. The Austrian Army 1740-80 (3): Specialist Troops. Reed International Books Ltd, 1995. p13. However, by the time of the Napoleonic Wars, troops from the Frontier were now formed into more regular line infantry regiments, but were considered by the Austrian generals as something between light and line infantry. They were given training in marksmanship, skirmishing and the basics of linear tactics. At the start of the war, the 18 Grenz infantry regiments formed about a quarter of the Habsburg army. Map of the Milit√§rgrenze or Military Frontier (marked with a red outline) However, the Grenzers were first and foremost skirmishing troops and were thought not to perform as well in the role of line infantry as the regular regiments. As such, many in the Austrian military command did not hold them in much esteem. Following a mutiny in 1800, their numbers were reduced from 57,000 to only 13,000. Despite this, the Grenz infantry performed consistently well in battle, especially at Marengo and Austerlitz, earning them respect from the French. Napoleon held them in high opinion and considered them as the most warlike troops in the entire Austrian army. He had no hesitation in using the Grenz infantry after Austria's defeat in the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809. The Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn compelled Austria to cede territory in the Military Frontier and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th and 11th Grenz Infantry Regiments went into French service. They fought for Napoleon until his defeat and abdication in 1814. During the 19th century, the threat from the Ottoman Turks diminished and there was less need for troops to defend the Frontier. Also, with rise of South Slav nationalism and self- determination, the Austrian high command grew suspicious of the Grenz infantry and a possible uprising. With these factors, the number of Grenz infantry were steadily reduced, although they remained in service in the Austrian and later Austro-Hungarian army until the First World War.  History  Grenzers defend state border from the Ottomans in Croatia and Slavonia and in Hungary, including Transylvania. In the territory of Croatia and Slavonia mercenaries Grenzers were Vlachs, Uskoks, Martolos while in Hungary there were Rascians, Vlachs, Martolos and Hajduks. The Vlachs in Croatia and the Hajduks in Hungary had not only personal but also territorial privileges. The big difference between them was that the name Vlach covers ethnic and even religious designation (Orthodox), while the name Hajduk does not have this connotation but rather denotes a special social layer.Ladislav Heka, 2019, The Vlach law and its comparison to the privileges of Hungarian brigands, https://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id;_clanak_jezik=325892 #page=30 Regiments *1.

It opened in 1847, when the Rushall Canal was built to create connections between the Birmingham Canal Navigations system and the Wyrley and Essington Canal, following the amalgamation of the two companies in 1840. History The Tame Valley Canal was built as part of a solution to the problem of congestion at Farmers Bridge Locks, where the Birmingham Canal Navigations main line ended and the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal began. The flight of 13 locks at the start of the Birmingham and Fazeley was the main link between the Birmingham system and the route to London via Aston Junction, the Digbeth Branch Canal and the Warwick and Birmingham Canal. The Tame Valley Canal, in conjunction with the Birmingham and Warwick Junction Canal, provided a northern bypass around the congestion. Both were authorised by Acts of Parliament on the same day, and both opened on 14 February 1844. The Tame Valley Canal ran from Tame Valley Junction on the Walsall Canal to Salford Junction on the Birmingham and Fazeley. The Birmingham and Warwick Junction Canal was a short link between Salford Junction and the Warwick and Birmingham Canal at Bordesley Junction. It included the five Garrison Locks, which saved boats from having to ascend the eleven locks of the Aston flight, and descend the six of the Ashted flight on the Digbeth Branch. The route from Salford Junction to Warwick and on to London became part of the Grand Union Canal in 1929. Following the amalgamation of the Wyrley and Essington Canal and the Birmingham Canal Navigations in 1840, a number of links between the two systems were constructed. A flight of locks at Walsall joined the Walsall Canal to Birchills Junction, and once the Tame Valley Canal was open, work started on the Rushall Canal, to connect it to the southern end of the Daw End Branch of the Wyrley and Essington at Longwood Junction. It was opened in 1847, and included nine locks, a flight of seven near the middle with two more just before the end-on junction at Longwood, which raised the level of the canal by . Location From the junction, the Tame Valley Canal heads westwards, running alongside the M6 motorway for about , before the two diverge, and the canal crosses the M5 motorway western slip road and a railway line on aqueducts. It is level for to its junction with the Walsall Canal at Tame Valley Junction. In the other direction, the canal heads to the south east, passing under a towpath bridge and the eastern sliproads of the M5 motorway. It reaches the top lock of the 13-lock Perry Barr flight, which drops the level of the canal by after . The Tame Valley Canal has towpaths on both banks for most of its length. The Rushall Canal heads northwards, under a towpath bridge, and almost immediately under the M6 motorway. The towpath is on the western bank, and the canal is level for to the bottom of the Rushall locks. After the motorway, there are three accommodation bridges, the third of which, Hill Farm Bridge, is a grade II listed structure. It is made of cast iron with abutments of brick and sandstone, and the balustrades consist of a latticework of saltire crosses. The footbridge to the east of the junction is of a similar design, and is also listed.

It is also available as pellets for embedding in structural wood. This alkaline salt is not to be confused with boric acid (an acidic chemical) or the laundry detergent additive used for stains. In common use as a termite control or for termite prevention, the liquid concentrate is used at a ratio of 1:1 with water. The advantages to this chemical over conventional pest control treatment is that it is non- carcinogenic and has a low toxicity to humans and pets. It is also odorless and proper application lasts for the lifetime of the wood. Repeat treatment is not necessary.

Life Maria was the daughter of the Mennonite preacher Allard Hulshoff (1734-1795) and Anna Debora van Oosterwijk (1745-1812), and for her whole life held onto her father's democratic, Patriotic and anti-Orangist views. Her first pamphlet, writes her biographer Geertje Wiersma, was a dissertation on democracy written by the prominent patriot Samuel Iperusz Wiselius - it is possible it was published under her name to protect Wiselius, the real author. She was taken into custody but because the authorities understood that the young woman was not the real author and the evidence against Wiselius was insufficient, the affair came to nothing. She wrote her second pamphlet, Oproeping aan het Bataafse volk (\\"An Appeal to the Batavian People\\", 1806), under her own name. She took up the task when she heard rumours that Napoleon was considering making one of his brothers king of Holland, and wrote in it against the imposition of Louis Bonaparte as king of Holland and for the Patriot Johan Valckenaer as her choice for the leadership of the Batavian Republic, making a prediction in the introduction which later came true: All but five copies of this pamphlet were destroyed by the authorities. Maria Aletta Hulshoff's family therefore kidnapped her and took her to safety in Bentheim, Germany, but - in combative mood - she escaped the grip of her family and returned to Holland. She sought the publicity that a trial would bring and demanded in a letter that she immediately be arrested. The strategy of her defenders Valckenaer and Willem Bilderdijk was not based on her birth, but was an apologia founded on the mental disturbance of a clergyman's daughter, stating that she was \\"in such a way touchingly thrown away from her naturally calm state of mind by her body\\" (\\"zodanig een aandoenlijk en door aandoenlijkheid buiten de natuurlijke staat van geestbedaardheid geworpen juffer\\"). The background to this defence is the 19th-century view that an unsatisfied and uterus (hystera being the Greek for uterus) makes a woman hysterical. This defense would make the unmarried Mietje unconvincing as a politician and so she dismissed Bilderdijk and Valckenaer and mounted her own defence. During the trial Mietje suffered a nervous breakdown, which became apparent when, at the moment the judges ordered her to apologise, she suddenly could not produce a single word. With no defence, she thus was condemned on 18 July 1806 to two years at her own expense in the stadsverbeterhuis (city house of correction), a sentence she served. The pious minister's daughter passed the time singing \\"clean religious and republican songs\\". When freed, she published a pamphlet against the Napoleontic conscription that characterized it as a \\"terrible and hateful requirement\\" (\\"verfoeilijke hatelijke requisitie\\"). This attack on the backbone of the Bonapartes' military dictatorship put her on its list of enemies of the regime, and she was to have been locked up in the castle at Woerden, one of the prisons for political adversaries of Napoleon's regime, but she got to know of this and - disguised as a man - fled to Amsterdam before she could be imprisoned. The description given of her broadcast by the authorities after her escape read: She was taken in and helped by her relation Wiselius and her mother's seamstress. Mietje then established herself in London where she got to know her Mennonite relations. Reports that she wanted to try to murder Napoleon in 1810 in his palace in Amsterdam or Apeldoorn appear to be unsupported by trustworthy sources, for the sources make clear he was well-guarded during his stays. From 1811 until 1820 she lived as a voluntary exile in New York City in the United States, where she wrote and published in English her \\"Handbook for pacifist- republicans\\" under the title \\"Republicans' Peace Manual\\". The subtitle of this work was borrowed from Propertius' Latin motto \\"In magnis volvisse satis\\" (or \\"sat est\\"), meaning \\"It is enough to have aimed for great things\\". The progressive Maria Aletta Hulshoff returned to the Netherlands in 1820 to take on further political activities. In 1827, in her last pamphlet, she wrote in favour of hygiene and vaccination against smallpox. Like many Mennonites, Maria remained single her whole life and had no children. In her rooms at the Egelantiersgracht by the Lijnbaansgracht, on the upper storey of number 99, all that was found after her death was \\"an empty cabinet, a desk with some female clothes of little value, two boxes of books and writings, a rag- blanket, two old chairs, a bed with two cushions, a few further bits of undignified junk\\". Yet was she rich, for she owned 22,400 guilder in paper money that she had left with Wiselius and other friends. Reception Contemporaries named her \\"ge√´xalteerd\\", \\"dweepzuchtig\\" or \\"hysterisch\\" (\\"hysterical\\"), since it was then considered that a woman should always hold her tongue on everything in the male-controlled domains of science, morals and politics. Hulshoff was happy to compare herself with Joan of Arc and, like Joan, she played some part in bringing on herself some of the dangers she encountered.

Beginning in 2004, the school added one grade each year. This process was finished in 2007 with the addition of Grade Twelve. The school's first principal was provincial curling champion Bryan Cochrane, who remained principal until June 2009 when he retired. He was replaced by Jeffrey Curtis, who was principal from September 2009 to June 2012. Shelly Corlyon, who was the school's vice principal from 2004 to 2010, became the school's 3rd principal in September 2012. Addition In June 2007, the provincial government granted funds to expand the school building. Work began in August 2007. The bulk of the construction was completed by the end of 2008 and the new addition was opened to students on January 31, 2009. Inclusivity and diversity Russell High's PRIDE alliance (GSA) has been very active in recent years, launching multiple campaigns for acceptance and diversity within the school, as well as hosting forums and workshops attended by students and faculty from surrounding schools. In 2015, the school introduced an all-gender washroom, something that was still very rare in North America at the time. On January 12, 2017, Russell High School hosted more than 50 students for the third annual Gender and Sexuality Alliance (GSA) Empowerment Day.

Opening in December 1861 on the Somerset Central Railway, which was at that time worked by the Bristol and Exeter Railway, it was the only intermediate station on the short branch from Glastonbury to Wells (Priory Road) railway station, which had opened in 1859. The station consisted of one short platform with a station building, with a single siding for freight. In 1950 unloading of wagons was effected by opening the side door and allowing this to rest on the adjacent fence. A lorry was then driven through an orchard to receive the goods. The siding and the adjacent level crossing were controlled from a small covered ground-frame. Polsham was downgraded to a halt in 1938, with tickets being sold by the train guard. Only a year before closure, six of the seven different types of ticket that were issued by the guard for travel from Polsham were still marked as being issued by the \\"Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway Committee\\", an illustration of the poor usage of the line.

A. Abbas). It was jointly written by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and Bijon Bhattacharya, based on plays by Bhattacharya and the story Annadata by Krishan Chander. The film had music by Ravi Shankar, with lyrics by Ali Sardar Jafri, Nemichand Jain, Vamiq, and Prem Dhawan. The film was based on the Bengal famine of 1943, which killed millions of Bengali people, and was one of the first films in Indian cinema's social-realist movement. In 1949, Dharti Ke Lal also became the first Indian film to receive widespread distribution in the Soviet Union (USSR),Dharti Ke Lal Indian Express. which led to the country becoming a major overseas market for Indian films. Overview Dharti Ke Lal was critically acclaimed for its scathing view of the notorious Bengal famine of 1943, in which millions of Bengali people died. It is considered an important political film as it gives a realistic portrayal of the changing social and economic climate during World War II. The film uses the plight of a single family caught in this famine, and tells the story of human devastation, and the loss of humanity during the struggle to survive. During the Bengal famine of 1943, members of the IPTA travelled all over India, performing plays and collecting funds for the survivors of the famine, which has destroyed a whole generation of farmer families in Bengal.Indian arts Thus Abbas was deeply influenced by the work of IPTA, and hence based his script upon two of IPTA's plays, Nabanna (Harvest) and Jabanbandi by Bijon Bhattacharya, and the story Annadata by Krishan Chander. Even the cast of the film was mainly actors from IPTA. The film marked another chapter in the influential new wave in Indian cinema, which focussed on socially relevant themes as in Neecha Nagar (1946), made by Chetan Anand, also scripted by Abbas, and which continued with Bimal Roy's Do Bigha Zamin (1953). It was the first and perhaps the only film produced by IPTA (Indian People's Theater Association) and remains one of the important Hindi films of that decade. The film marked the screen debut of Zohra Sehgal and also gave actor Balraj Sahni his first important on screen role.Balraj Sahani Rediff.com.

March 30, 2010. The long-term therapeutic goal is to develop a vaccine-based mechanism to treat infected individuals that either prevents or significantly slows progression to symptomatic HIV, including AIDS, by stimulating an infected individual's immune system to resist the progression of infection. The study is being completed at the AIDS Research Consortium of Atlanta.Shafer, Matt. \\"ARCA Seeks Volunteers for Historic HIV Vaccine Trial.\\" GA Voice.

May 27, 2010. Corporate history Formed in 2001 in Atlanta, Georgia, the approach used in HIV-1 vaccine development was originally based on preclinical work done by Dr. Harriet RobinsonHarriet Robinson PhD. Emory University, Emory Center for AIDS Research.Harriet L Robinson Labome.org. from 1992 to 2002. In 2002 laboratory space, equipment and personnel were acquired and work on an HIV-1 vaccine development plan began, and in May 2006 human clinical trials of the drug began. GeoVax HIV-1 Vaccine From preclinical results (using SHIV) 96% of primates (22/23) were protected from the virus over a three and a half year period when vaccinated, while by contrast five out of six primates died within eight months after being infected when left untreated. The vaccine works with a combined DNA vaccine and MVA (modified vaccinia Ankara) vaccine both of which lead to the insertion of genes into primate DNA which leads to foreign protein expression. With the GeoVax vaccine a variety of HIV proteins (both surface and internal) are expressed from genes which include the Env, Pol and Gag genes. Current trials= Therapeutic Vaccine Clinical Trials  During 2010, the AIDS Research Consortium of Atlanta (ARCA) began patient recruitment for a Phase 1 clinical trial sponsored by GeoVax Labs, Inc., investigating GeoVax's DNA/MVA vaccine as a treatment for individuals already infected with HIV. The trial is primarily designed as a safety study, but will also collect and report data on the vaccine's ability to elicit protective immune responses and control re-emergent virus during a pause in drug treatment. As part of the trial protocol, a volunteer must have begun drug treatment in the first year of infection and have achieved 6 months of stable viral control on drug treatment before entry into the trial and receipt of the first vaccination.  Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials  GeoVax published results of Phase 1 safety and immunogenicity testing for its preventive vaccine trial on March 1, 2011.Goepfert, Paul A. et al. \\"Phase 1 Safety and Immunogenicity Testing of DNA and Recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara Vaccines Expressing HIV-1 Virus-like Particles.\\" The Journal of Infectious Diseases. 2011;203:610‚Äì619. Based on published results, GeoVax will be advancing two regimens forward into the Phase 2a HVTN 205 trial. Regimens selected for advancement are the DDMM combination, which produced the highest T cell response rates, and the MMM combination. The MMM regimen produced the highest antibody-induced immune response. The DDMM regimen consists of priming with two doses of the pGA2/JS7 recombinant DNA vaccine and boosting with two doses of VA/HIV62B recombinant MVA vaccine. The MMM regimen consists of priming and boosting with a total of three doses of the recombinant MVA vaccine.GeoVax Labs, Inc. \\"GeoVax Announces Publication of Phase 1 Clinical Trial in The Journal of Infectious Diseases: Trial Results Establish Vaccine Safety and Immunogenicity.\\" Media release. February 23, 2011. HVTN 205 Study‚ÄîIn early 2009, the HVTN began enrolling patients in a preventive Phase 2 clinical trial sponsored by GeoVax Labs, Inc. This study is investigating a prime-boost approach using GeoVax's combination DNA/MVA vaccine. During 2010, the study was expanded from 225 to 300 participants to include an arm gathering additional data on three MVA injections, without the use of the DNA component, which is an addition to the original arm testing two DNA priming and two MVA boosting injections. Preliminary results were announced by the company on December 9, 2010. Preliminary results indicate an excellent safety profile and highly reproducible immunogenicity subsequently confirmed by the official publication above in The Journal of Infectious Diseases.GeoVax Labs, Inc. \\"Excellent Safety and Reproducible Immunogenocity Demonstrated in Early Results of Phase 2A Trial for HIV Preventative Vaccine.\\" Media Release. December 9, 2010.  Phase 2a Clinical Trial Expansion  In April 2011, GeoVax Labs, Inc. in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) announced an expansion of the current Phase 2a clinical trial to include a new component. The new trial is HVTN 094 and will be conducted by the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. \\"Specifically, the HVTN plans to clinically test a novel vaccine product developed by GeoVax scientists that expresses human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in combination with inactivated HIV proteins. The novel vaccine consists of a recombinant DNA vaccine co- expressing human GM-CSF and non-infectious HIV virus-likeparticles. The DNA vaccine is used to prime immune responses that are subsequently boosted by vaccination with a recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vectored vaccine. The MVA expresses the HIV virus-like-particles, but does not express GM-CSF. The regimen builds on the GeoVax DNA/MVA vaccine that is currently in Phase 2a clinical testing through the HVTN.\\"GeoVax Labs, Inc. \\"Expansion of HIV/AIDS Vaccine Program Announced by GeoVax Labs, Inc.\\" Media Release.

App Wins YAP With Property Map  Criticism  As with other search engines, Nestoria's search index is as updated and accurate as the data obtained from its sources (property portals and websites), which in turn are fed from estate agents' data. The quality of the search results (e.g. if a house is still on the market or already sold) strongly depends on the motivation of local estate agents to upload accurate information and to update them regularly. In Spain, Brazil, France and Italy, the real estate market is based on non-exclusive contracts between property sellers and estate agents. Estate agents try not to disclose the precise location of the homes on the Internet. This prevents Nestoria from geocoding many properties accurately on a map.

Works=GIG GIG: Americans Talk About Their Jobs, co-edited with Marisa Bowe and Sabin Streeter, is an oral history based on Studs Terkel‚Äôs Working, offering a collection of 126 interviews from rich to poor, giving voice to the American labor force. Excerpted in the New Yorker magazine and rated one of the Best Business Books of 2000 by Harvard Business Review. Nobodies Nobodies: Modern American Slave Labor and the Dark Side of the New Global Economy is an examination of modern slavery in the United States, focusing particularly upon the widening gap between rich and poor, both in the US and globally, and what this means for notions of freedom and democracy. \\"Nobodies\\" began as an article published in 2003 for The New Yorker . The book was published by Random House in September 2007. \\"Nobodies\\" follows Bowe's journey inside three illegal workplaces where foreign employees are enslaved, offering exclusive interviews and eyewitness accounts. The book exposes the corporate duplicity, subcontracting and immigration fraud, and moral sleights of hand that allow forced labor to continue in the United States. The book begins in the fields of Immokalee, Florida where underpaid or unpaid undocumented workers pick the produce that feeds the supply chains of companies such as Pepsi Company and Tropicana. Secondly, Bowe travels to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where the John Pickle Company exploited temporary workers imported from India to boost profits while making pressure tanks used by oil refineries and power plants. Lastly, in Saipan, a U.S. commonwealth, Bowe documents an economy built upon guest workers, where 90 percent of the female population work sixty-hour weeks for $3.05 an hour and spend weekends trying to trade sex for green cards. Nobodies was named one of the best twenty books of 2007 by Village Voice. Bowe appeared on The Daily Show on September 24, 2007 to talk about Nobodies. US: Americans Talk About Love US: Americans Talk About Making Love is a selection of oral histories about relationships. John Bowe collaborated with a team of interviewers and co-editors to record and collect the love stories of a diverse range of U.S citizens. The book has been translated into German, Polish, and Mandarin. I Have Something to Say I Have Something to Say: Mastering the Art of Public Speaking in an Age of Disconnection, Bowe discovers the lost art of speech training and immerses himself in a chapter of Toastmasters International to learn the meaning and value of \\"public speaking.\\" Between lessons, he explores the roots of speech training and rhetoric in Ancient Greece and connects this once-universal component of education to modern problems of isolation, partisanship, and civic disengagement. I Have Something to Say is less a how-to manual than for rediscovering the importance of this basic building block of civil society. Awards John Bowe is a recipient of the J.

Biography  Born in Hadley, Telford, Shropshire, Clements was one of the leaders in the introduction of massed start road races to Britain, initially as a rider and later as a sponsor.RR Pioneer Ernie Clements Passes Away British Cycling 11 February 2006 He won the BLRC British national road race championship in 1943 and 1945, and came second in 1944. Riders who competed in BLRC races were banned from competing in NCU races, but Clements managed to circumvent the ban; he won the NCU national road championship in 1946 and come second in 1948. If Clements had not been a member of the NCU, he would not have been considered to ride the world amateur road championship in 1946, nor the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. At the latter event, he won a silver medal as part of the team in the road race - alongside team mates Bob Maitland, Gordon Thomas and Ian Scott. Clements also won the first stage of the Brighton- Glasgow race in 1951.\\"1951 Brighton to Glasgow, Stage one was Brighton to London, won by Ernie Clements from Wolverhampton.\\" Extract from 'A Ketley Mon' by Terry Low. Note - possible inaccuracies: The 1946 Brighton-Glasgow race programme states that E A (Ernie) Clements won the first stage of the 1945 Brighton-Glasgow race. This also indicates that Ernie Clements was Ernest A rather than Ernest J Clements. This is supported by the Register of Births for England and Wales which lists an Ernest A Clements as being registered in the March quarter of 1922 in the Wellington District of Shropshire. In 1947, there was a proposal that he turn professional should Britain send a team to the Tour de France. Clements declined and in the event no team was sent anyway. Clements said he turned down the chance because he did not wish to relinquish his amateur status in Britain.Worcester News & Hereford Times 10 February 2006 At the time, cyclists in Britain were unable to return to amateur status once they had been professionals. This proved restrictive for many professional cyclists, who at the end of their careers were unable to return to competing at a lower level purely for enjoyment. Clements was born in Hadley, Shropshire but spent the majority of his early years at Old Park where he later opened a cycle shop. He became a frame builder and managed Falcon Cycles in the 1950s, and up to the 1970s. His last address was in Ledbury, Herefordshire where, aged 67 in 1990, he opened Clements Cycles to keep in touch with cycling.Obituary in the LVRC newsletter He died in Malvern Community Hospital, Malvern, Worcestershire, aged 83 on 5 February 2006, having suffered from Parkinson's disease for several years. In memoriam His death was announced in the Cycling Weekly magazine through a paid small-ad. It said: :CLEMENTS - ERNEST.

The station opened in 1858 as the interim western terminus of the line from the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway at Witham (Somerset). In 1862, the East Somerset line was extended westwards to Wells and in 1878 a junction was made in Wells with the Cheddar Valley Railway that enabled through running between Witham and Yatton. By this time the line had been taken over entirely by the Great Western Railway. For most of its life, the station was known simply as \\"Shepton Mallet\\", the larger title coming into use in 1949 to differentiate the station in the British Railways era from the town's other station on the unconnected Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. The S&DJR; station, less conveniently situated for the town centre, had been known as Shepton Mallet (Charlton Road) since 1883. Due to the reviews of the Beeching Axe, the station closed to passenger traffic with the withdrawal of services between Yatton and Witham on 9 September 1963. Goods traffic ceased within a year, though goods trains continued to pass through until 1969 with stone from a nearby quarry. The station building survived as a depot for a cleaning company for some years. After it was decided to clear the site for redevelopment, the station building was dismantled in 2008 for use by the East Somerset Railway for a planned 'new' station at Shepton Mallet.

Quartered arms of Sir Robert Radclyffe, 5th Earl of Sussex, KG Robert Radclyffe, 5th Earl of Sussex, KG (12 June 1573 ‚Äì 22 September 1629) was an English peer. Life He was the only son of Henry Radclyffe, 4th Earl of Sussex and his wife Honora Pounde, and was known as Viscount Fitzwalter from 1583 until he succeeded his father as Earl on 4 December 1593. In August 1594 Sussex was sent as ambassador-extraordinary to Scotland to assist at the baptism of James VI's eldest son, Henry, and with a diplomatic mission. His companions in Scotland were Lord Wharton, Sir Henry Bromley, Hugh Portman, Henry Guildford, Oliver Cromwell, Thomas Monson, Henry Clare, Edward Greville, Nicholas Sanderson, Edward Gorges, and William Jeffson, with Richard Coningsby and Mr Rolles. The baptism was delayed until the party arrived at Stirling Castle. Sussex had audiences with James VI of Scotland and Anne of Denmark on 29 August and the baptism was held on the next day. Sussex carried the child from his bedchamber to the Chapel Royal and back again. After discussions with James VI about Catholics and Scottish rebels, Sussex left Scotland on 12 September with a gift of silver-gilt plates and was injured by a horse near Northallerton on 14 September.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 418, 422-3, 439: Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts', Scottish History Society Miscellany XVI (Woodbridge, 2020), p. 78. In 1596 he served with the army sent against Cadiz as colonel of a regiment of foot, took a prominent part with Horace Vere in the capture of the town, and was knighted there by Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex on 27 June 1596. In November 1597 he appealed to Lord Burghley for military employment on the continent. He acted as Earl Marshal of England during the parliaments which sat in the autumns of 1597 and 1601, and was colonel-general of foot in the army of London in August 1599, raised in anticipation of a Spanish invasion; in 1599 also he became a Knight of the Garter. Although implicated in Essex's rebellion of 1601,http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/Essex_rebellion.htm he was one of the peers commissioned to try him, and was made lord lieutenant of Essex on 26 August 1603. He was also governor of Harwich and Landguard Fort. On 20 July 1603 he petitioned the queen to relieve him of some of the pecuniary embarrassments due to the debts to the crown contracted by the third and fourth earls. In July 1622 he sold to the Marquis of Buckingham his ancestral estate of Newhall, Essex for ¬£22,000, and resigned to him the lord- lieutenancy of Essex. He was reappointed joint lord lieutenant in 1625. Sussex was frequently at court, carried the purple ermined robe at the creation of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales, 4 November 1616, and bore the orb at the coronation of Charles I on 2 Feb. 1626. He died at his house in Clerkenwell on 22 September 1629, and was buried with his father and uncle in the church of Boreham. Patronage Sussex was a patron of men of letters. In 1592 Robert Greene dedicated to him as Lord Fitzwalter Euphues Shadow, by Thomas Lodge. George Chapman prefixed to his translation of the Iliad (1598), a sonnet to him, 'with duty always remembered to his honoured countess.' A sonnet was also addressed to the earl by Henry Lok, in his Sundry Christian Passions, 1597, and Emanuel Ford dedicated to him in 1598 his popular romance Parismus. Family Sussex was twice married. His first wife was Bridget, daughter of Sir Charles Morison of Cassiobury, Hertfordshire. In her honour Robert Greene gave his Philomela the subtitle of The Lady Fitzwa[l]ter's Nightingale, 1592. To her was also dedicated a popular music-book, The New Booke of Tabliture, 1596. The marriage was troubled; John Manningham reported in his Diary, 12 October 1602, that the earl treated her cruelly and blamed his companion Edmund Whitelocke, brother of Sir James Whitelocke, who died at Newhall in 1608, and was buried in the earl's family tomb at Boreham. Before 1602 she, with her children, separated from Sussex, who allowed her ¬£1,700 a year (according to Manningham). She died in December 1623. She bore Sussex four children, who all predeceased him; * Henry Radclyffe, who married, in February 1614, Jane, daughter of Sir Michael Stanhope. * Thomas Radclyffe. * Elizabeth Radclyffe, who married John Ramsay, 1st Earl of Holderness, the wedding was celebrated with the masque The Hue and Cry After Cupid on 9 February 1608 * Honora Radclyffe. Sussex's second wife was Frances, widow of Francis Shute, daughter of Hercules Meautas, of West Ham. She died on 18 November 1627. Sussex was succeeded by his cousin Edward Radclyffe (1552?-1641), son of Sir Humphrey Radcliffe of Elnestow, Bedfordshire, the second son of Robert Radclyffe, 1st Earl of Sussex.

The East Somerset Railway, an offshoot of the Great Western Railway-owned Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway, extended its line to Wells in 1862 with its own station to the east of Priory Road. Then in 1870, the Bristol and Exeter Railway's Cheddar Valley Railway from Yatton reached Wells with a third terminus station at Tucker Street to the north west of Priory Road. Finally, in 1878, with all three lines by this time converted to standard gauge, the GWR linked the Cheddar Valley line to the East Somerset line by running over a stretch of the Somerset and Dorset line, including through Priory Road station. The East Somerset station closed on the commencement of through-running, but the through trains did not stop at Priory Road until 1934 and for 56 years passengers from, say, Glastonbury to Cheddar would need to change stations in Wells. Priory Road adopted the full name in October 1883, and the Cheddar Valley line station was renamed as Tucker Street in 1920. Priory Road station consisted of one platform with a station building and an overall roof. The adjacent goods yard and junction with the GWR were controlled from a signal box. The station closed to passengers on 29 October 1951 and the train shed roof was taken down soon after, although passenger traffic on the former GWR line through the station continued until 1963, with goods traffic until 1969.

The footballers are the most successful group within a sports club that also includes departments for athletics, gymnastics, and handball. History The earliest roots of the association go back to the 1848 formation of the gymnastics club Scharmbecker- Osterholzer Turnverein/Scharmbecker Turnerbund in 1848. Other clubs, including Turnverein Gut Heil Osterholz von 1881, Pyramidenclub Osterholz Frisch auf von 1896, and Arbeiter-Turn- und Sportverein Osterholz-Scharmbeck von 1906, became part of VSK over the years. The football side has its origins in the 1909 establishment of Fu√üballverein Preu√üen 09 which was renamed in the 1930s to Sportverein Prussia 09 Osterholz Scharmbeck, and later Spielvereinigung Osterholz-Scharmbeck, vormals Preu√üen 09. With the onset of World War II the club's activities were suspended as much of the membership left to serve in the armed forces. Following the conflict organizations across the country, including sports and football clubs, were ordered dissolved by the occupying Allied authorities. The club was re-established in February 1946 as Verein f√ºr Sport und K√∂rperpflege Osterholz-Scharmbeck. In the early 1950s and again from the late 1950s through to the early 1960s, the club played in what was then third division football in the Amateurliga Niedersachsen / Staffel VI, with their best result being a second-place finish in 1957. In 1962 turmoil within the club led to the footballers separating to play as 1. FC Osterholz- Scharmbeck, which made its way into the Verbandsliga Nord (IV) in 1974 and immediately claimed a title there. A new football department was quickly established within VSK.

They are part of the hacktivism movement. History The group was formed in November 1984, during a \\"debriefing\\" workshop of the European Peace Marches on the Hartmannswillerkopf in Alsace, France, following the struggle against the installation of Pershing II and SS-20 nuclear missiles in Germany (Mutlangen). From 1978 to 1985, this European-wide peace movement had mobilized millions of citizens, protesting the arms race, the growth of military spending and joining in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. In reference to George Orwell's novel 1984 and to the Rebel Alliance of the movie Star Wars, the group chose the (ironic) name 1984 Network Liberty Alliance. Founders are Andr√© Gorz, French philosopher, Dov Lerner, MIT computer graduate and disciple of Saul Alinsky, as well as Gregoire Seither, free radio activist, Frauke Hahn who had led the woman's resistance ('Commons Women') at Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp, David Szwarc from the Israeli Peace movement and Adama Drasiweni, computer graduate from the University of London, future founder of N'DA, Africa's first independent telecom company. Other members, like Australian co-founder of Indymedia Matthew Arnison, south-African anti-apartheid militant Peter Makema and Israeli peace activists Uri Avnery and Michel Warchawsky, joined later on. All were active in various social movements and peace initiatives in Europe and the USA. When Richard Stallman published the GNU Manifesto in March 1985 and called for participation and support, Dov Lerner and Gregor Seither started organizing regular meetings and workshops in order to train activists in the use of information technology and gather support for the Free Software movement. Adama Drasiweni, owner of a computer business in London, set up similar workshops in Kibera, a giant slum outside of Nairobi, Kenya. In France, the Alliance used the network of the Maisons de l'Informatique that had been set up under the presidency of Fran√ßois Mitterrand as well as the computer labs of Paris University, who access to academic networks and Billboard Systems. The group ran a number of BBS, among them 'Pom-Pom', devoted to the Apple Macintosh and 'PeaceNet', an \\"electronic pow-wow\\" to help social activists and community organizers exchange information around the world, offering free mail accounts and file hosting services. Very soon the issues of free speech, software patents, civil rights and surveillance became some of the major topics addressed by the Alliance, the group being accused of hacking and fork software. One of the BBS run by the group 'Gaia rising', was accused by the German government of being a meeting point for radical environmental activists as well as anarchists. The Liberty Alliance was particularly active in the popular worldwide resistance to Multilateral Agreement on Investments (MAI) in the mid-1990s, networking multiple groups and providing \\"open cyberspaces\\" for activists to share information and experience. In the summer of 1998 the first alternative media centre was set up in a bus in Birmingham, United Kingdom during the Global Street Party, an international day of protest and festive actions coinciding with the 24th G8 Summit. The alternative media centres also provided interpretation and language services to international militant meetings, like during the July 1999 Global Carnival against Capitalism, or J18 London, a giant rally and party in the heart of the London City, meant as a counter-summit to the 25th G8 Summit in K√∂ln, Germany. Members of the team travelled to the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 in Seattle to set up an alternative media centre during the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity. The project joined with that of other media activists and, out of the necessity to bypass the corporate media and report on a WTO conference but also to show how one could bypass corporate software (Windows), the independent media agency Indymedia was born. Language diversity and the lack of interpreters led a number of activists to start thinking about a way to help militants from around the world to bridge the language barrier. Three years later, during the 27th G8 summit in Genoa, Italy, this would lead to the creation of the Babels network of volunteer interpreters and translators for linguistic diversity and social change. Members of the Network Liberty Alliance have worked on social IT projects in North America (San Francisco Free Software movement, Chicago community cybercenter), Central America (Nicaragua, Guatemala, Panama), the Middle-East (Egypt, Israeli Civil Administration area) as well as in the Asia Pacific region (Indonesia, Nouvelle-Cal√©donie, Australia, Papua Niugini) and Africa (Malawi, Mali, Cameroon). When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, another member of the Alliance, Stefan Ostrowsky, transferred \\"NET(te) Bude\\" (a play on the word NET like network, and 'Nette Bude', nice crashpad in German), a community IT training centre to East-Berlin, thus becoming the first 'Cybercafe' behind the iron curtain.

She was sold for scrap in 1981. History The second warship to be named Nimble by the Navy, MSO-459 was laid down as AM-459, 27 April 1953 by Higgins, Inc., New Orleans, Louisiana; launched 6 August 1954 sponsored by Miss Helen M. Wakeman; reclassified MSO-459 on 7 February 1955; and commissioned 11 May 1955, Lt. John T. O'Brien in command.  East Coast operations  Nimble, a non-magnetic minesweeper of laminated wood construction, reported for duty with Mine Force, Atlantic Fleet, at New Orleans, 2 June 1955 and departed for her homeport, Charleston, South Carolina. From Charleston, she continued on to Narragansett Bay for shakedown, thence to Key West, Florida, and Little Creek, Virginia, for various training exercises to enable her to sweep magnetic, contact, acoustic and pressure sea mines.  First European deployment  Until September 1956 Nimble was employed in operations in the 6th Naval District. On the 4th of that month, she departed the South Carolina coast for her first European deployment. Steaming to the North Sea, she participated in NATO exercises, then sailed to the Mediterranean to serve in the U.S. 6th Fleet until 22 February 1957. Beginning with that deployment, Nimble steamed to the Mediterranean for 6 months duty with the 6th Fleet on a bi-yearly basis until 1964. Breaking that pattern in that year, she resumed it in 1965, and has continued to follow it into 1970. Nimble Participated in the recovery effort of the 1966 Palomares B-52 crash.Melson, June 1967, p.31  Supporting NATO exercises and other operations  On her 6th Fleet deployments she has participated in NATO and fleet exercises; while her U.S. 2nd Fleet duties have brought regular Caribbean operations as well as U.S. East Coast exercises including NATO maneuvers.

The easternmost segment of the route runs through the southern part of New Jersey between the Delaware Memorial Bridge over the Delaware River in Pennsville Township, Salem County, where it continues into Delaware along with Interstate 295 (I-295), east to Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Avenue in Atlantic City, Atlantic County. The route passes through Salem, Gloucester, and Atlantic counties as well as the boroughs of Woodstown, Elmer, Newfield, and Buena. The route encounters a mix of rural, suburban, and urban environs throughout its journey across South Jersey. In 1923, pre-1927 Route 18S was to run from Penns Grove to Atlantic City along much of present- day US 40 in New Jersey. US 40 was signed along Route 18S in 1926, running from a ferry in Penns Grove that crossed the Delaware River to Wilmington, Delaware. In 1927, Route 18S was renumbered to Route 48. The portion of US 40 in Atlantic City was legislated as Route 55 in 1938, around the same time the route was moved to a ferry across the Delaware River between Pennsville and New Castle, Delaware. After the Delaware Memorial Bridge and the New Jersey Turnpike were both completed in 1951, US 40 was moved to its current alignment in the area. In 1953, the Route 48 and Route 55 designations along US 40 were removed. A toll freeway was once planned along the US 40 corridor in the 1980s to alleviate traffic, but it was never built after it was deemed the traffic volume was not high enough for it to be constructed. Route description=Salem County US 40 westbound and I-295 southbound approaching the Delaware Memorial BridgeUS 40 enters New Jersey along with I-295 from Delaware on the Delaware Memorial Bridge over the Delaware River. The road heads southeast into Salem County as an eight-lane freeway maintained by the Delaware River and Bay Authority that passes through industrial areas. I-295/US 40 interchanges with the southern terminus of US 130 and the western terminus of Route 49, where I-295 splits from US 40 by turning northeast on a freeway that soon overlaps CR 551 briefly while US 40 follows the four-lane New Jersey Turnpike and continues east on it for a short distance, entering Carneys Point Township. US 40 splits from the New Jersey Turnpike at the last exit before the toll barrier, the same point where Route 140 heads west and CR 540 heads to the east. From this point, US 40 becomes an at-grade, four-lane divided highway maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation called Wiley Road that runs a short distance south of the New Jersey Turnpike, containing a wide median. It continues into rural areas consisting of woods, farms, and residences, heading farther to the south of the New Jersey Turnpike. View west along US 40 at Glassboro Road in Pilesgrove Township Upon meeting the eastern terminus of Route 48, US 40 turns to the southeast and becomes the Harding Highway, a two-lane undivided road that passes through more agricultural areas. Upon crossing CR 646, the road enters Pilesgrove Township and continues past the Cowtown Rodeo. The route passes through the residential community of Sharptown before coming to an intersection with Route 45. At this point, US 40 turns to the northeast to run concurrent on Route 45 and enters Woodstown, where it becomes West Avenue and passes residences before reaching the downtown area. Here, Route 45 splits from US 40 by heading north on Main Street and US 40 continues to the east as East Avenue. The route passes through more developed areas, crossing the Southern Railroad of New Jersey's Salem Branch line and heading north of Woodstown High School. The route crosses from Woodstown into Pilesgrove Township again, where it turns east-southeast as Harding Highway and heads back into a mix of fields and woods amid homes. About after entering Upper Pittsgrove Township, the road crosses CR 581. In the community of Pole Tavern further to the east, US 40 encounters Route 77, CR 604, and CR 635 at the Pole Tavern Circle. Past Pole Tavern, the road passes more farm fields before coming to Elmer, where it becomes Chestnut Street. In Elmer, the route passes homes and makes a turn to the northeast onto Front Street. Upon leaving Elmer, US 40 becomes Harding Highway again and forms the border of Upper Pittsgrove Township to the north and Pittsgrove Township to the south, passing through forested areas among development. The route crosses CR 553 before passing through the community of Porchtown. Gloucester and Atlantic counties US 40 westbound past CR 661 in Franklin TownshipAfter Porchtown, US 40 crosses into Franklin Township in Gloucester County, turning southeast and running through more woods. It comes to a cloverleaf interchange with Route 55, where US 40 is briefly a four-lane divided highway. Past Route 55, the route continues past Malaga Lake and comes to the community of Malaga. In Malaga, the route heads into a business district and intersects Route 47, turning to the northeast to run concurrent on a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane through inhabited areas. After passing over Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Vineland Secondary railroad line, US 40 and Route 47 split. Route 47 heads north and US 40 turns south and continues parallel to the railroad tracks. The road makes a turn to the east-southeast, leaving Malaga and returning to areas of farmland and trees. The road briefly runs along the northern border of Newfield before coming to a crossroads with CR 555. After passing near the Vineland-Downstown Airport, US 40 intersects CR 557 and forms a concurrency with that route. US 40 westbound concurrent with CR 559 in Mays Landing Immediately after CR 557 joins US 40, the road enters Buena, Atlantic County and continues southeast into inhabited areas. After running through the commercial center of town, where it crosses the Southern Railroad of New Jersey's Southern Running Track line, the road comes to the southern terminus of Route 54 and the eastern end of CR 619 in a business area located on the outskirts. At this point, it enters Buena Vista Township, and CR 557 splits form US 40 by heading to the southeast on Buena-Tuckahoe Road. From this point, US 40 becomes concurrent with CR 557 Truck and enters dense woodland containing homes and businesses as well as occasional farms. The road reaches the residential community of Richland, where it encounters the eastern terminus of CR 540 and CR 622 and crosses Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Beesleys Point Secondary railroad line. Upon leaving Richland, the route crosses into Hamilton Township, where it runs through Mizpah before heading back into forested areas and a few residential sectors. US 40 intersects the eastern terminus of CR 552, briefly becoming a divided highway before turning east into denser inhabited areas. The highway intersects CR 559 Truck/CR 606, at which point it becomes concurrent with CR 559 Truck. The route meets Route 50, where CR 557 Truck splits to the south. Route 50 joins US 40 before the road crosses the Great Egg Harbor River. Upon crossing the river, the road enters Mays Landing and turns north into the downtown area. CR 559 Truck splits southbound to follow CR 617 to the east. A short distance later, the road meets CR 559 and US 40 splits from Route 50 by turning east onto that route. This intersection marks the beginning of CR 559 Truck northbound. The road passes more development before CR 559 splits from the road by heading southeast. US 40 heads east out of Mays Landing, where it continues through woodland and increasing residential development. The road widens into four lanes as it comes to US 322 (Black Horse Pike) near the Hamilton Mall. At this point, US 40 forms a concurrency with US 322, which lasts for the remainder of the route. US 40/US 322 westbound in Egg Harbor Township The two routes continue to the southeast through business areas, meeting CR 575 and a ramp to the Atlantic City Expressway. CR 575 turns east to follow US 40/US 322. The road enters Egg Harbor Township, and CR 575 splits from US 40/US 322 by turning to the south. The route passes more wooded residential and commercial areas, as well as the Storybook Land amusement park, before intersecting CR 563. US 40/US 322 forms a concurrency with that route and passes through a business district that includes the Harbor Square shopping center. CR 563 splits from the road by continuing southeast and the Black Horse Pike heads east interchange with the Garden State Parkway. The only direct ramp present is between the Black Horse Pike westbound and the Garden State Parkway northbound; all other movements are provided by CR 563. Past here, US 40/US 322 continues east past more businesses, crossing CR 651 before entering Pleasantville. In Pleasantville, the road crosses US 9, where the name changes to Verona Avenue. Upon crossing CR 585, the Black Horse Pike continues past residences as an undivided road, crossing back into Egg Harbor Township. The road passes more businesses, closely paralleling the Atlantic City Expressway before entering Atlantic City. Here, the name becomes Albany Avenue and it comes to a pair of ramps that provide access to and from the Black Horse Pike eastbound and the Atlantic City Expressway westbound. US 40/US 322 enters marshland, crossing the Great Thorofare onto Great Island before passing over the Beach Thorofare. Past this bridge, the road passes between businesses to the west and the closed Bader Field airport and Surf Stadium to the east. US 40/US 322 crosses the Inside Thorofare on a drawbridge and continues as a county maintained road to its end at Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Avenue, one block from the boardwalk. Through New Jersey, US 40 serves as a main road connecting Atlantic City with points south along Interstate 95, such as Baltimore and Washington, D.C. History Route 55 (1938-1953)The portion of US 40 that overlaps US 322 follows the Black Horse Pike, a turnpike established in 1855 that was to run from Camden to Atlantic City via Blackwoodtown. In 1902, the Atlantic County Board of Freeholders authorized the construction of a toll-free highway from Pleasantville to Albany Avenue in Atlantic City, which was completed in 1905. The entire route of modern US 40 was signed as the Powder Way, running from the ferry at Penn's Grove to Atlantic City.Rand McNally and Co. \\"Eastern Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, South East Michigan, Southern Ontario, Western New York: District No. 4\\".

In 1923, pre-1927 Route 18S was created along the current alignment of US 40 east of the Route 48 intersection, running from Penns Grove to Atlantic City. When the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926, the alignment of US 40 in New Jersey ran from Penns Grove, where a ferry carried the route across the Delaware River to Wilmington, Delaware, east to Atlantic City along pre-1927 Route 18S. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering that occurred a year later, pre-1927 Route 18S was replaced by Route 48.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319. In 1936, US 322 was also signed concurrent with US 40 on the Black Horse Pike. The portion of US 40/US 322 that existed in Atlantic City was legislated as Route 55 in 1938.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1938, Chapter 283. Also by 1938, US 40 was moved to a ferry that ran across the Delaware River between Pennsville and New Castle, Delaware, following current Route 49, local roads, and CR 551 to travel between the ferry and Route 48. Following the completion of the Delaware Memorial Bridge and the New Jersey Turnpike in 1951, US 40 was moved to the new bridge and routed to follow a small portion of the New Jersey Turnpike and Wiley Road to the current eastern terminus of Route 48. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, which eliminated concurrencies between U.S. highways and state routes, Route 48 was removed from the portion of US 40 east of its current eastern terminus and the Route 55 designation was dropped entirely. In the 1980s, Congressman William J. Hughes proposed a freeway along the US 40 corridor in order to alleviate increased traffic along that route following the legalization of gambling in Atlantic City. This freeway, which was to be maintained by the New Jersey Expressway Authority, was to run from the Delaware Memorial Bridge east to Atlantic City. The NJDOT determined that the traffic volume on US 40 did not justify the construction of a freeway along the corridor. The Cardiff Circle along US 40/US 322 at CR 563 and CR 608 in Egg Harbor Township was eliminated in a $3.7 million project completed in 2002. In 2013, the road was one of three that tied for the #1 ranking on the Tri-State Transportation Campaign's list of the top ten most dangerous roads for pedestrians in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. The route, along with U.S. Route 130 (Burlington Pike) in Burlington County and U.S. Route 1 in Middlesex County, were so ranked due to the nine pedestrian deaths that occurred on each of those roads from 2009 to 2011. Due to frequent flooding in Atlantic County, NJDOT announced in 2019 a plan to reconstruct and raise a one-mile portion of the roadway from Naples Avenue to Bayport Drive by . The $27.5 million project is scheduled to begin in 2022 and completed in 2025.

Early life Fowlds was born in Fenwick, East Ayrshire, Scotland. His father, Matthew Fowlds, was a handloom weaver and was the last surviving member of the Fenwick Weavers' Society. He lived to be 101 years old. As a boy, George Fowlds weaved linen sheets. He attended Hairshaw School in Waterside. He did his apprenticeship at a clothier in Kilmarnock, and later worked in Glasgow, where he attended night classes at Anderson's College. Fowlds emigrated to South Africa in 1882 and lived in Cape Town, Beaufort West, and Bultfontein. In 1884, he married Mary Ann Fulton, who was also from Fenwick. In the following year, they moved to Auckland, New Zealand, as the South African climate was detrimental to his wife's health. He built up a business as a clothier in Victoria Street. Member of Parliament In the , Fowlds stood in the three-member electorate and came seventh. Fowlds represented the City of Auckland electorate from 1899 to 1902, and then the Grey Lynn electorate from 1902 to 1911. In 1905 Fowlds decided to return to Scotland for his father's 100th birthday. He decided he needed a New Zealand passport when his ship was about to leave, though they were not then usually required for overseas travel; an inconvenience to the department, and to the Governor who then personally signed each New Zealand passport.Bassett, Michael, The Mother of All Departments (1997, Auckland University Press, Auckland) In 1911, Fowlds introduced the Proportional Representation And Effective Voting Bill (86-1). However, this bill failed to be passed into law. Independent Liberal Though critical of some of the policies of Premier Richard Seddon, Fowlds did not support the New Liberal Party in 1905. He was \\"in favour of the referendum and an elective Executive\\". Fowlds was Minister of Education and Minister of Public Health from 1906 to 1911. He resigned from Cabinet in September 1911 so he could remain a private member until there was \\"a truly democratic party in a position to form a government\\". Fowlds stood as an Independent Liberal Labour candidate for Grey Lynn in the 1911 election. At the next contest in 1914 he was under the United Labour Party banner. But, in 1919, he was again a Liberal. Death and legacy Fowlds was made a CBE in 1919 and knighted in 1928. He was the first chairman of Massey Agricultural College from 1927 to 1934. He died on 17 August 1934 at Auckland and was survived by his wife. The personal papers of Sir George Fowlds are housed in Special Collections at the University of Auckland Library. The extensive collection covers political, personal, business and social matters and includes letters, newspaper clippings, speech drafts, articles, sermons, accounts books, photographs and cartoons.

Whale hall. Giraffe skeleton. The Natural History Museum of the University of Pisa is an Italian natural history museum at Pisa. It is part of the University of Pisa and located in the former monastery of the Pisa Charterhouse. In 1981, the University of Pisa moved its natural history museum to the Charterhouse. The collection was started in Pisa in the 16th century as a collection of curiosities connected to Giardino dei Semplici. It now houses one of the largest collection of cetaceans skeletons in Europe. Grand Duke Ferdinand I of Tuscany established the Museum of Natural History of the University of Pisa in1596, He moved specimens from the Florentine palaces of the Medici. The oldest collections in the museum are seashells collected by the Italian invertebrate scientist, Niccol√≤ Gualtieri. There is also an assembly of five thousand zoological specimens collected by the Italian geologist and ornithologist, Paolo Savi. History Ritratto di Ferdiando I The origin of the museum dates back to the sixteenth century when the Grand Duke of Tuscany Ferdinando I de 'Medici set up a Wunderkammer (chamber of wonders) attached to the Giardino dei Semplici These were galleries that collected bizarre or rare natural artefacts, widespread in European courts of that period. Unlike many of the other chambers of wonders, the one in Pisa has always been linked to the city's university institution; the direction was in fact entrusted to Luca Ghini, founder and curator of the botanical garden. This link meant that the collection took on a more rigorous and scientific connotation almost from the start. In 1595 Ferdinando ordered that the various Florentine naturalistic collections be brought into the gallery and in the following year he formalized the institution, thus founding one of the first museums in the world. During the seventeenth century, the museum underwent a phase of decline also due to the change of attitude that took place towards Pisa when the Grand Duchy passed from the hands of Ferdinand I to those of Cosimo II and a few years later to Ferdinand II. In fact, it was the latter's brother, Cardinal Leopoldo, who commissioned Niccol√≤ Stenone in 1672 to draw up an inventory of the objects in the gallery, choose the most valuable pieces and bring them to Florence to be exhibited in the newly created Florentine gallery. However, despite Steno's taking a considerable part of the finds, the museum's collections continued to grow thanks to bequests from the collections of the various prefects. The museum's decline ended in 1737 when the Grand Duchy of Tuscany passed from the Medici to the Lorraine. With the Lorraine in government and with the spread of Enlightenment thought, the Pisan university regained prestige and fame. The museum was enriched with new collections: in particular, in 1747, Francis I of Lorraine bought an important part of the malacological collection for the museum of the Florentine physician Niccol√≤ Gualtieri, including more than three thousand specimens collected by the Dutch naturalist Georg Eberhard Rumphius. In the nineteenth century the museum had its period of maximum expansion. In 1814, the University of Pisa decided to separate the chairs of scientific teaching, entrusting Gaetano Savi with that of Botany and Giorgio Santi that of zoology, palaeontology and geology. This separation of the chairs meant that the museum, which at the time also included the botanical collections under a single direction, was divided into two distinct administrations with greater decision-making autonomy. Paolo Savi Under the direction of Paolo Savi, the collections were enormously enriched, the exhibition spaces were enlarged, and hundreds of writings were published. Moreover Savi, with the help of Pacini and Studiati, in 5 years completed 170 taxidermies of mammals and 1274 of birds, which still today are an integral part of the museum's historical collections. These also include the first dioramas ever made. In 1842 the chair of geology was separated from those of zoology and palaeontology, and Savi called upon the Neapolitan Leopoldo Pilla to fill it, who brought with him a large number of Vesuvian rocks and crystals. In Pilla, in 1849, Giuseppe Malpighi succeeded, who collected the first nucleus of the paleontological collections. With the death of Paolo Savi in 1871, the professorships and the direction of the museum passed to Richiardi, who collected an important collection of cetaceans and fish. Furthermore, it is to him that the zootomic preparations of the comparative anatomy collection are due. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the museum was shaken by the world wars. During the Second World War some of the collections were damaged by Allied bombings and the museum was closed. At the end of 2016, while it had already been undergoing a phase of total renovation for about ten years, the museum received a donation from the Barbero foundation of a collection of more than 550 animals in taxidermy, mostly mammals. This donation represents the largest acquisition the museum has made since the 19th century. Galleries * History of the collections * Amphibians and Reptiles * Evolution of Whales * * Dinosaur court and gallery * Palaeontology of Monti Pisani * Aquarium * Mammals * Birds * Palaeoanthropology * Mineral gallery * Prehistory of Monti Pisani Vertebrate collections The museum contains the osteology collections of Sebastiano Richiardi. The bird collection consists of 9,000 mounts, and about 1,000 skins, 275 skeletons, 1,100 eggs, 800 nests, and 450 anatomical specimens. The museum specializes in Italian birds, especially from the Pisa and Tuscany region. Cetacean gallery Cetaceans has been a part of the museum was little more than a gallery annexed to the Orto botanico di Pisa The cetacean collection was significantly enriched between the second half of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, thanks to then- director Sebastiano Richiardi who, wanting to create a collection that had at least one specimen for each species of existing cetacean. The collection includes the mandible of the sperm whale beached in 1714 in Populonia. The most recent acquisitions are linked to local whale beaching The collection currently has more than 50 finds of cetaceans. Most are skeletal remains although there are also preparations preserved in liquid. While this is not the largest in the number of specimens it has the largest diversity with 27 different species. The gallery contains complete skeletons of Hector's dolphin, White-beaked dolphin, Finless porpoise, and the very rare Andrews' beaked whale; as well as those of the Sei whale and blue whale, the latter purchased, again by Richiardi, in 1900 from the Museum of Natural History of Bergen, in Norway. In addition, the museum also houses the only adult skeletons of Humpback whales and North Atlantic right whales present in Italy, the only two Killer Whale skeletons in Italy, the only two complete with beluga, and the only one complete with boreal hyperodon. Alongside the collection of current cetaceans, the museum also possesses various finds of fossil cetaceans of various origins and acquisitions, although a large part of them was donated to the Museum by the Florentine paleontologist Roberto Lawley, such as the remains of an individual from Etruridelphis giulii. Skull of Aegyptocetus tarfa In this gallery is a fossil skeleton of Hippopotamus antiquus found near Rome and having an age between 40 and 100 thousand years. Also, there is a reconstruction of Indohyus, a terrestrial mammal ancestor of modern cetaceans. The exhibition then continues with the cast of a skeleton and the reconstruction of an Ambulocetus natans, an ancient cetacean that was probably able to both swim and walk. There is a holotype of Aegyptocetus tarfa found in 2002 by a marble cutter of Pietrasanta in a block of Egyptian limestone . The path then ends with a series of casts of fossils belonging to Cynthiacetus. The cetacean gallery itself is located in the following room inside the room called Loggione della Vigna , a 110-meter long space surmounted by a gabled roof which, when the Certosa was still inhabited by the friars, was used for drying in the wind of hay and grains which were then stored in the numerous silos located at the edge of the structure. There is also a blue whale, and the fin whale. The exhibition was organized in 2018 into eight thematic areas containing more than 28 skeletons from the 27 species present in the collection, as well as 11 life-sized models including a baleen, five casts of fossils mostly discovered and studied by the team of the University of Pisa, such as that of Livyatan melvillei as well as from real fossils, such as the holotypes of Balaenula astensis, found in Portacomaro in 1940. Complete blue whale skeleton over 22 meters long. Purchased in 1900 from the Natural History Museum of Bergen, Norway, for about three thousand gold lire. Arrived by ship to the port of Livorno and then transported to Pisa on wagons.  Blaschka glass collection  Collection of marine invertebrates‚Äô glass reproductions by Leopold Blaschka. Consisting of 51 marine invertebrates reproduction created for didactical purposes and probably belonging to the first phase of Blaschka‚Äôs production (1822 ‚Äì 1895), the collection is a remarkable example of the fusion between science and technology, art, craftsmanship and design. Blaschka glass sculpture  Mollusc collections  The museum contains: * 700 samples collected by Niccol√≤ Gualtieri which were studied by Carl Linnaeus. Linnaeus used many of these specimens in his tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. * Samples from Georg Eberhard Rumphius acquired in 1747 by Francesco di Lorena. Insect collections The museum contains insects collected by: * √âdouard M√©n√©tries * Carlo Giuseppe Gen√© * Imre Frivaldszky * Pierre Fran√ßois Marie Auguste Dejean * Maximilian Spinola * Carlo Passerini. Fossils Many Italian specimens from the lagerst√§tte region near Verona, of Monte Bolca.  Aquarium  Six-banded distichodus The Museum is home to the largest freshwater aquarium in Italy. Ezio Tongiorgi had aquariums set up for a few months in the cellars of the now disused Certosa in 1981. However, it was in 2008 that the aquarium became a permanent exhibition of the museum, in fact, 24 tanks were re-installed in the cellar, thus creating the first of the five current sectors. On May 13, 2016, the other four sections were inaugurated which made the aquarium the largest in Italy, with its 60,000 liters of freshwater.

He was known for his philanthropic contributions to the arts and environmental causes, including New York City's Central Park, specifically the Arthur Ross Pinetum. Early life Arthur Ross was born in Manhattan, New York City, on November 25, 1910. Ross originally enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. But he transferred to Columbia University during the Great Depression to support his family. He graduated from Columbia University in 1931. He held a number of jobs during the Depression and his college years, including a shirt salesman at Macy's. Ross joined the United States Navy during World War II. He served as a lieutenant commander. His tours of duty took him to Ecuador and Panama for several years. Career Arthur Ross began his career in 1932 at Sutro Brothers & Company, a Wall Street brokerage firm. He left the company in 1938 and joined Central National Corporation the same year. Central National Corporation was an investment banking subsidiary of Gottesman & Company, a privately held company specializing in chemicals and wood pulp. Ross stayed at Central National and rose to become Vice President of the combined parent company, now called Central National-Gottesman Inc., in 1974. Philanthropy Arthur Ross worked on a number of important philanthropic causes throughout his life. Most involved the arts, the environment and international affairs. Central ParkArthur Ross Pinetum= Arthur Ross began to finance the establishment of the Arthur Ross Pinetum in 1971 with Cornelius O'Shea, Central Park's chief forester. The pinetum, located to the northwest of Central Park's Great Lawn, covers of Central Park. The Arthur Ross Pinetum is currently home to a collection of 25 species of conifers, from both the United States and other countries. Ross stayed actively involved in the pinetum, despite some instances of early vandalism. Ross added approximately 35 pine trees a year to the Arthur Ross Pinetum. His collection grew to include trees from the Himalayas, Macedonia and Japan. The pinetum became a popular recreational area for New Yorkers. Wendy Wasserstein, a New York City based playwright, called the Arthur Ross Pinetum \\"a little bit of Maine in Manhattan.\\" =Central Park Conservancy= Arthur Ross became a board member of the Central Park Conservancy in 1980. Ross continued to work for the survival and renewal of Central Park. He sponsored an exhibition about Central Park at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in 1980. A second Ross sponsored exhibition of Central Park was held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1981. Ross financed the research and development of a subspecies of Chinese elm, developed by researchers from a tree grown in Central Park. The descendants of this particular subspecies have been used in Central Park and worldwide to replace elm species destroyed by Dutch elm disease. The Ross financed subspecies is immune to the disease. Ross also contributed anonymously to other public New York City parks and other facilities. Among his contributions was a $350,000 donation to a city-owned nursery in the Bronx.

A large variety of techniques and devices are used to provide indoor positioning ranging from reconfigured devices already deployed such as smartphones, WiFi and Bluetooth antennas, digital cameras, and clocks; to purpose built installations with relays and beacons strategically placed throughout a defined space. Lights, radio waves, magnetic fields, acoustic signals, and behavioral analytics are all used in IPS networks. IPS can achieve position accuracy of 2 cm, which is on par with RTK enabled GNSS receivers that can achieve 2 cm accuracy outdoors. IPS use different technologies, including distance measurement to nearby anchor nodes (nodes with known fixed positions, e.g. WiFi / LiFi access points, Bluetooth beacons or Ultra-Wideband beacons), magnetic positioning, dead reckoning. They either actively locate mobile devices and tags or provide ambient location or environmental context for devices to get sensed. The localized nature of an IPS has resulted in design fragmentation, with systems making use of various optical,Liu X, Makino H, Mase K. 2010.

IEICE Transactions on Communications E93-B(11):2936-44. radio, or even acoustic technologies. IPS has broad applications in commercial, military, retail, and inventory tracking industries. There are several commercial systems on the market, but no standards for an IPS system. Instead each installation is tailored to spatial dimensions, building materials, accuracy needs, and budget constraints. For smoothing to compensate for stochastic (unpredictable) errors there must be a sound method for reducing the error budget significantly. The system might include information from other systems to cope for physical ambiguity and to enable error compensation. Detecting the device's orientation (often referred to as the compass direction in order to disambiguate it from smartphone vertical orientation) can be achieved either by detecting landmarks inside images taken in real time, or by using trilateration with beacons.Positioning and orientation using image processing a 2007 research from the University of Washington. Several similar approaches have been developed and there are currently (2017) smartphone applications implementing this technology. There also exist technologies for detecting magnetometric information inside buildings or locations with steel structures or in iron ore mines.Startup uses a smartphone to track people indoors, - About Indoor Atlass (MIT Technology Review website)  Applicability and precision  Due to the signal attenuation caused by construction materials, the satellite based Global Positioning System (GPS) loses significant power indoors affecting the required coverage for receivers by at least four satellites. In addition, the multiple reflections at surfaces cause multi-path propagation serving for uncontrollable errors. These very same effects are degrading all known solutions for indoor locating which uses electromagnetic waves from indoor transmitters to indoor receivers. A bundle of physical and mathematical methods are applied to compensate for these problems. Promising direction radio frequency positioning error correction opened by the use of alternative sources of navigational information, such as inertial measurement unit (IMU), monocular camera Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and WiFi SLAM. Integration of data from various navigation systems with different physical principles can increase the accuracy and robustness of the overall solution.Vladimir Maximov and Oleg Tabarovsky, LLC RTLS, Moscow, Russia (2013).

Horvath (2014): The Measurement Preciseness of the GPS Built in Smartphones and Tablets, International Journal on Electronics and Communication Technology, issue 1, pp 17-19, Currently, GNSS receivers are becoming more and more sensitive due to increasing microchip processing power. High Sensitivity GNSS receivers are able to receive satellite signals in most indoor environments and attempts to determine the 3D position indoors have been successful. Besides increasing the sensitivity of the receivers, the technique of A-GPS is used, where the almanac and other information are transferred through a mobile phone. However, proper coverage for the required four satellites to locate a receiver is not achieved with all current designs (2008‚Äì11) for indoor operations. Beyond, the average error budget for GNSS systems normally is much larger than the confinements, in which the locating shall be performed.  Types of usage = Locating and positioning  While most current IPS are able to detect the location of an object, they are so coarse that they cannot be used to detect the orientation or direction of an object.  Locating and tracking  One of the methods to thrive for sufficient operational suitability is \\"tracking\\". Whether a sequence of locations determined form a trajectory from the first to the most actual location. Statistical methods then serve for smoothing the locations determined in a track resembling the physical capabilities of the object to move. This smoothing must be applied, when a target moves and also for a resident target, to compensate erratic measures. Otherwise the single resident location or even the followed trajectory would compose of an itinerant sequence of jumps.  Identification and segregation  In most applications the population of targets is larger than just one. Hence the IPS must serve a proper specific identification for each observed target and must be capable to segregate and separate the targets individually within the group. An IPS must be able to identify the entities being tracked, despite the \\"non-interesting\\" neighbors. Depending on the design, either a sensor network must know from which tag it has received information, or a locating device must be able to identify the targets directly.  Wireless technologies  Any wireless technology can be used for locating. Many different systems take advantage of existing wireless infrastructure for indoor positioning. There are three primary system topology options for hardware and software configuration, network-based, terminal-based, and terminal-assisted. Positioning accuracy can be increased at the expense of wireless infrastructure equipment and installations.  Wi-Fi-based positioning system (WPS)  Wi-Fi positioning system (WPS) is used where GPS is inadequate. The localization technique used for positioning with wireless access points is based on measuring the intensity of the received signal (received signal strength in English RSS) and the method of \\"fingerprinting\\".P.

Typical parameters useful to geolocate the Wi-Fi hotspot or wireless access point include the SSID and the MAC address of the access point. The accuracy depends on the number of positions that have been entered into the database. The possible signal fluctuations that may occur can increase errors and inaccuracies in the path of the user. (Best Demo Award)  Bluetooth  Originally, Bluetooth was concerned about proximity, not about exact location. Bluetooth was not intended to offer a pinned location like GPS, however is known as a geo-fence or micro-fence solution which makes it an indoor proximity solution, not an indoor positioning solution. Micromapping and indoor mapping has been linked to Bluetooth and to the Bluetooth LE based iBeacon promoted by Apple Inc.. Large-scale indoor positioning system based on iBeacons has been implemented and applied in practice. Bluetooth speaker position and home networks can be used for broad reference.  Choke point concepts  Simple concept of location indexing and presence reporting for tagged objects, uses known sensor identification only. This is usually the case with passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) / NFC systems, which do not report the signal strengths and various distances of single tags or of a bulk of tags and do not renew any before known location coordinates of the sensor or current location of any tags. Operability of such approaches requires some narrow passage to prevent from passing by out of range.  Grid concepts  Instead of long range measurement, a dense network of low-range receivers may be arranged, e.g. in a grid pattern for economy, throughout the space being observed. Due to the low range, a tagged entity will be identified by only a few close, networked receivers. An identified tag must be within range of the identifying reader, allowing a rough approximation of the tag location. Advanced systems combine visual coverage with a camera grid with the wireless coverage for the rough location.  Long range sensor concepts  Most systems use a continuous physical measurement (such as angle and distance or distance only) along with the identification data in one combined signal. Reach by these sensors mostly covers an entire floor, or an aisle or just a single room. Short reach solutions get applied with multiple sensors and overlapping reach.  Angle of arrival  Angle of arrival (AoA) is the angle from which a signal arrives at a receiver. AoA is usually determined by measuring the time difference of arrival (TDOA) between multiple antennas in a sensor array. In other receivers, it is determined by an array of highly directional sensors‚Äîthe angle can be determined by which sensor received the signal. AoA is usually used with triangulation and a known base line to find the location relative to two anchor transmitters.  Time of arrival  Time of arrival (ToA, also time of flight) is the amount of time a signal takes to propagate from transmitter to receiver. Because the signal propagation rate is constant and known (ignoring differences in mediums) the travel time of a signal can be used to directly calculate distance. Multiple measurements can be combined with trilateration and multilateration to find a location. This is the technique used by GPS. Systems which use ToA, generally require a complicated synchronization mechanism to maintain a reliable source of time for sensors (though this can be avoided in carefully designed systems by using repeaters to establish coupling). The accuracy of the TOA based methods often suffers from massive multipath conditions in indoor localization, which is caused by the reflection and diffraction of the RF signal from objects (e.g., interior wall, doors or furniture) in the environment. However, it is possible to reduce the effect of multipath by applying temporal or spatial sparsity based techniques. C.R. Comsa, et al.,‚ÄúSource Localization Using Time Difference Of Arrival Within A Sparse Representation Framework‚Äù, ICASSP, 2011.  Received signal strength indication  Received signal strength indication (RSSI) is a measurement of the power level received by sensor. Because radio waves propagate according to the inverse-square law, distance can be approximated (typically to within 1.5 meters in ideal conditions and 2 to 4 meters in standard conditions) based on the relationship between transmitted and received signal strength (the transmission strength is a constant based on the equipment being used), as long as no other errors contribute to faulty results. The inside of buildings is not free space, so accuracy is significantly impacted by reflection and absorption from walls. Non-stationary objects such as doors, furniture, and people can pose an even greater problem, as they can affect the signal strength in dynamic, unpredictable ways. A lot of systems use enhanced Wi-Fi infrastructure to provide location information. None of these systems serves for proper operation with any infrastructure as is. Unfortunately, Wi-Fi signal strength measurements are extremely noisy, so there is ongoing research focused on making more accurate systems by using statistics to filter out the inaccurate input data. Wi-Fi Positioning Systems are sometimes used outdoors as a supplement to GPS on mobile devices, where only few erratic reflections disturb the results.  Others wireless technologies  * Radio frequency identification (RFID): passive tags are very cost-effective, but do not support any metrics * Ultrawide band (UWB): reduced interference with other devices * Infrared (IR): previously included in most mobile devices * Gen2IR (second generation infrared) * Visible light communicationLee, Yong Up; Kavehrad, Mohsen;, \\"Long-range indoor hybrid localization system design with visible light communications and wireless network,\\" Photonics Society Summer Topical Meeting Series, 2012 IEEE, vol., no., pp.82-83, 9‚Äì11 July 2012 See publication here (VLC), as LiFi: can use existing lighting systems * Ultrasound: waves move very slowly, which results in much higher accuracy  Other technologies  Non-radio technologies can be used for positioning without using the existing wireless infrastructure. This can provide increased accuracy at the expense of costly equipment and installations.  Magnetic positioning  Magnetic positioning can offer pedestrians with smartphones an indoor accuracy of 1‚Äì2 meters with 90% confidence level, without using the additional wireless infrastructure for positioning. Magnetic positioning is based on the iron inside buildings that create local variations in the Earth's magnetic field. Un-optimized compass chips inside smartphones can sense and record these magnetic variations to map indoor locations.  Inertial measurements  Pedestrian dead reckoning and other approaches for positioning of pedestrians propose an inertial measurement unit carried by the pedestrian either by measuring steps indirectly (step counting) or in a foot mounted approach, sometimes referring to maps or other additional sensors to constrain the inherent sensor drift encountered with inertial navigation. The MEMS inertial sensors suffer from internal noises which result in cubically growing position error with time. To reduce the error growth in such devices a Kalman Filtering based approach is often used. However, in order to make it capable to build map itself, the SLAM algorithm framework Simultaneous localization and mapping will be used.Wan Mohd Yaakob Wan Bejuri, Mohd Murtadha Mohamad, Raja Zahilah (2015).

The actual position estimation can be found as the maximum of a 2-d probability distribution which is recomputed at each step taking into account the noise model of all the sensors involved and the constraints posed by walls and furniture. Based on the motions and users' walking behaviors, IPS is able to estimate users' locations by machine learning algorithms.  Positioning based on visual markers  A visual positioning system can determine the location of a camera-enabled mobile device by decoding location coordinates from visual markers. In such a system, markers are placed at specific locations throughout a venue, each marker encoding that location's coordinates: latitude, longitude and height off the floor. Measuring the visual angle from the device to the marker enables the device to estimate its own location coordinates in reference to the marker. Coordinates include latitude, longitude, level and altitude off the floor.Roberto Michel, (2016) Information Management: Wearables come in for a refit, Modern Materials Handling, Retrieved Dec 28, 2016.  Location based on known visual features  A collection of successive snapshots from a mobile device's camera can build a database of images that is suitable for estimating location in a venue. Once the database is built, a mobile device moving through the venue can take snapshots that can be interpolated into the venue's database, yielding location coordinates. These coordinates can be used in conjunction with other location techniques for higher accuracy. Note that this can be a special case of sensor fusion where a camera plays the role of yet another sensor.  Mathematics  Once sensor data has been collected, an IPS tries to determine the location from which the received transmission was most likely collected. The data from a single sensor is generally ambiguous and must be resolved by a series of statistical procedures to combine several sensor input streams.  Empirical method  One way to determine position is to match the data from the unknown location with a large set of known locations using an algorithm such as k-nearest neighbor. This technique requires a comprehensive on-site survey and will be inaccurate with any significant change in the environment (due to moving persons or moved objects).  Mathematical modeling  Location will be calculated mathematically by approximating signal propagation and finding angles and / or distance. Inverse trigonometry will then be used to determine location: * Trilateration (distance from anchors) * Triangulation (angle to anchors) Advanced systems combine more accurate physical models with statistical procedures: * Bayesian statistical analysis (probabilistic model) * Kalman filtering (for estimating proper value streams under noise conditions). Uses The major consumer benefit of indoor positioning is the expansion of location-aware mobile computing indoors. As mobile devices become ubiquitous, contextual awareness for applications has become a priority for developers. Most applications currently rely on GPS, however, and function poorly indoors. Applications benefiting from indoor location include: * Accessibility aids for the visually impaired. * Augmented reality * School campus *Museum guided tours * Shopping malls, including hypermarkets. * Warehouses * Factory * Airports, bus, train and subway stations * Parking lots, including these in hypermarkets * Targeted advertising * Social networking * Hospitals * Hotels * Sports * Cruise Ships * Indoor robotics * Tourism * Amusement Parks See alsoReferences  External links * EZ Localization * Micromapping in OpenStreetMap * Indoor Mapping in OpenStreetMap * IPIN Conferences.

The UAW were engaged in talks with General Motors (GM) to negotiate a new labor contract but were unable to come to an agreement before the deadline. Consequently, 73,000 workers walked out forcing 80 GM facilities in 30 states to cease operations. After the two day strike, the two parties reached an agreement in which the UAW union would assume the responsibility for managing retiree healthcare liabilities. The UAW previously went on strike against General Motors in 1970.  Background  The automobile industry landscape in 2007 was drastically different to what it once was. GM's market share had been steadily decreasing as foreign automakers entered the market. Foreign players secured over 50% of market share for the first time in history in July 2007. GM's foreign competitors Nissan, Honda, and Toyota increased their production within the United States. Part of GM's struggles has been its relatively high costs of production. While many of the foreign manufacturers pay less in wages as most of their plants are not a part of a union, GM's labor contracts increase its costs per car by an estimated $2000 impacting its competitiveness. These costs can be attributed to worker pensions and healthcare programs the unions have negotiated. General Motors Chevrolet plant in 1973 The number of UAW members at GM has also steadily decreased as the company downsized. At the time of the 2007 strike, the 73,000 workers at GM are far lower than the 400,000 workers GM employed when the UAW last went on strike in 1970. The UAW's lower overall membership was also caused by the increasing prevalence of non-unionized plants and factories belonging to foreign automakers. It once had over 1.5 million workers but by 2007, that number had shrunk to just several hundred thousand. General Motors' previous labor contract with the UAW union went up until September 14th, 2007. Both parties agreed to an extension of 10 days until September 24th as the UAW felt that negotiations were still progressing. However, following the end of this 10 day period, as negotiations came to a stalemate the UAW believed a strike was necessary as GM refused to acquiesce to the UAW's demands in regards to job security and worker benefits.  Motivations  General Motors' losing market share within the United States automobile market has forced the company to downsize the company. In the two years leading up to 2007, GM had incurred $12.3 billion in losses. In response, GM has since closed down numerous factories and laid off thousands of workers. At the time of the strike, GM was also planning on cutting an additional 30,000 jobs in the coming year. The UAW wanted to ensure job security for the remaining GM workers and demanded for guarantees stipulating that those workers employed under the contract would stay employed until the contract expired. Another issue of contention between GM and UAW was the company's liabilities to retirees in regards to their healthcare benefits. These liabilities amounted to $51 billion. Both parties were in talks to discuss transferring these liabilities to a trust, which was GM's primary demand. The establishment of a voluntary employee benefit association (VEBA) has been an idea that was widely embraced by GM's investors and managers. Doing so what entail a large initial payment from GM but would allow it to remove workers healthcare benefits as a liability on its balance sheet. It was believed that removing these costs from the equation would allow GM to increase its competitiveness in the industry.  Strike  Ron Gettelfinger, President of the United Automobile Workers Union from 2002 - 2010 Immediately after the deadline had passed, the UAW union moved to a national strike that involved 73,000 workers walking out of an estimated 80 GM facilities. After the union announced the strike, negotiations continued that same afternoon lasting over five hours. In the UAW's press conference, its president Ron Gettelfinger expressed his disappointment in GM's management and their refusal to meet the union halfway. He believed that the UAW had no choice but to strike stating that: ‚ÄúThere comes a point in time where you have to draw a line in the sand‚Äù. Many saw this as the UAW refusing to roll over to management's demands from GM. Gettelfinger also expressed that the UAW was willing to consider GM's request to form a trust to take on healthcare liabilities, and that job security remained the union's number one concern. The effect of the strike was an operational halt that would otherwise produce 12,200 cars a day. Concerns were raised regarding the effect of the strike on GM if an agreement wasn't reached. The strike had the potential to influence GM supply chains and overseas plants that manufacture parts. Nearby operations in Mexico and Canada would also suffer as a result. The strike became a focus within the automobile industry as how it played it out would likely affect negotiations the UAW would later have with Ford and Chrysler given the vulnerable state of the United States‚Äô auto companies. Despite the strike, Michael Robinet, the vice president of CSM Worldwide and an expert on global vehicle forecasts, predicted that GM would not have any issues with a shortage of vehicle production. In fact, he expected that the company would not experience issues related to inventory shortages for two to three weeks should the strike continue as a result of no agreement being reached. At the time, GM's inventory levels were generally higher than that of their competitors, a point that many linked to the company's poor sales in recent months leading up to the strike. On the first day of the strike, GM's stock closed 20 cents lower in the trading session, wiping out what was originally a gain of 2.6% earlier on in the day. The consensus amongst analysts evaluating GM's position in the strike was that while a long strike would be highly detrimental for the company as it seeks to turn its business around and become more profitable. With that said, many believed that GM would still be well positioned to endure a strike that was shorter in nature.  Resolution  On September 26th, it was announced that early that morning, the UAW and GM reached a deal. Specifics of the deal were not made available, however the headline for GM was that the UAW had agreed to the establishment of a VEBA that would assume the retiree healthcare liabilities worth $51 billion. Gettelfinger described that job guarantees were made by GM although the details were not disclosed. After reaching the deal, the UAW's executives stated their intention to meet again on the 28th of September to discuss and approve the contract. If successful, the contract would then be moved to be voted on by the workers in the union to finalize the agreement. Gettelfinger expressed his confidence that GM's workers would vote in favor of this newly negotiated contract. Had the contract not been approved by both the UAW leaders and the workers, the UAW made it clear that the strike would continue. It was reported that members who had information regarding the details of the VEBA disclosed that the trust would be funded by a combination of various assets including cash and GM stock. The trust's establishment would be subject to approval by the Security and Exchange Commission and the relevant court of law. The approval process was expected to last over a year with the earliest completion date being sometime in 2009. The agreement involved allowing GM to access the pension fund for the purpose of reimbursing retirees for the increased healthcare benefits offered in the years preceding the deal, as the pension was seen as being overfunded. Newspapers also reported sources that indicated some of the terms of the new contract involved a steep decrease in the wages of lower tier workers along with lower signing bonuses. Other sources confirmed that the two parties agreed to meet on a yearly basis to evaluate and discuss the healthcare trust. It was reported that GM was willing to make additional contributions to the fund if it was determined to be necessary if the amount was within a range the company considered reasonable.  Impact  It was also expected that the leaders of the UAW would discuss the details of the GM contract with labor officials at the other large automobile manufacturers, Ford and Chrysler, as a part of a series of labor contract negotiations within the industry. At the time, the UAW union was also in negotiations with them over new labor contracts although little progress had been made. Many experts pointed out the possibility that both Ford and Chrysler could establish similar VEBA trusts which would reduce liabilities, something that many of these companies have looked forward to. GM believed that the agreement would allow them to ‚Äúsignificantly improve its manufacturing competitiveness‚Äù. Investor sentiment regarding the deal being reached was generally positive for GM as they have been proponents for the establishment of the VEBA trust. After the deal was reached between GM and the UAW union, the stock price of GM increased by 4.2% in the morning of that trading session, and closed with a 9% rise reaching its highest mark in ten weeks. GM's bond prices also increased following the news. The stock price of Ford increased by more than 6% in the same session, likely linked to investor expectations that a similar deal would be reached in their negotiations with the UAW. Credit rating agencies shared a similarly positive response to the deal. Fitch was in discussions to lower GM's rating and that of some of its suppliers, however decided to hold off after the new deal was announced. Standard and Poor‚Äôs discussed the possibility of increasing GM's long term rating moving forward. GM pointed out their healthcare spending in the previous year totaled $4.8 billion, an amount that could have been spent towards launching six vehicle models or building an additional four manufacturing plants. Wall street analysts were expecting GM to benefit from increased healthcare cost savings amounting to $3 billion annually as a consequence of the newly established VEBA trust.

Established in 1802, it is Newton's third cemetery. It has 357 recorded burials, dating between 1803 and 1938. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description and history The South Burying Ground occupies a roughly rectangular on the west side of Winchester Street, a short way south of Massachusetts Route 9 in Newton Highlands. The cemetery's primary topographical features are two knolls, which flank the main entrance. The street-facing front and parts of the sides of the cemetery are lined by a stone wall that is probably of 19th century origin. A chain link fence is mounted on the wall, and encircles the rest of the property. The main entrance is secured by a chain-link gate. The cemetery has no paved lanes, although early 20th century maps show a rectilinear grid of them. The cemetery was established as a private cemetery by local citizens in 1802, and was the first that was not associated with a parish. It has 357 recorded burials, among them eleven veterans of the American Revolutionary War and two from the American Civil War. The property was transferred to the city, which continues to own and maintain it. Use of the cemetery declined after the large Newton Cemetery opened in 1855, and the last interment here was in 1938. The cemetery is normally locked and not open to public access.

Commissioner, 331 U.S. 1 (1947), was a case heard before the United States Supreme Court concerning the value, for tax purposes, of inherited property with a nonrecourse mortgage encumbering it. According to Boris I. Bittker, Crane \\"laid the foundation stone of most tax shelters.\\" Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson wrote the opinion. Facts Petitioner, Crane, was the sole beneficiary and executrix of her husband's estate. She inherited an apartment building and land, which secured a principal debt of $255,000 and interest in default of $7,042. The property was for estate tax purposes at a value equal to the mortgage encumbrance. Six years later, with foreclosure imminent, the property was sold for $3,000 subject to the mortgage and Crane incurred $500 in expenses to complete the sale. Crane reported $2,500.00 of taxable gain from the sale of the apartment. Issue 1 Did the original basis in the hands of Mrs. Crane include the full value of the property inherited, undiminished by the loan debt? Issue 2 Should the amount of the debt assumed by the purchaser of the apartment building have been included in Mrs. Crane's calculation of the amount realized on the sale? Arguments Crane argued that the \\"property\\" she acquired upon her husband's death was simply the equity in the land and building, which was the excess of the value of the land and building over the then-existing mortgage (i.e. the equity was zero based on the facts). As a result, she argued that the amount she realized on the sale of the building was her net cash received: $2,500. The Commissioner of the IRS claimed that the property inherited by Crane was the building and land itself, not merely the equity in the building and land. This position had the merit of comporting with the facts at hand: prior to selling the property, Mrs. Crane had been allowed depreciation deductions in excess of $25,000 on the building. Correspondingly, the Commissioner argued that Crane, through the sale of the building and land, received an amount equal to the net of the cash received in addition to the amount of debt assumed by the purchaser. Holding and rationale The Court first sided with the Commissioner, agreeing with its construction of the relevant statutory provision that addresses the basis of \\"property\\" inherited. The Court found no basis to think \\"equity\\" was a synonym for \\"property.\\" In addition, the Court was troubled by the administrative complications that would be caused by replacing \\"property\\" with \\"equity\\" when determining depreciation, and by turning over administrative rules that had existed for some time. Second, the Court determined that the amount Mrs. Crane realized from the sale of the \\"property\\" should be driven by the conclusion on the first issue. The Court sided with cases repudiating the claim that there must be an actual receipt of money or other property for a taxable gain to result from a transaction. Finally, the Court determined that a mortgagor who transfers a property subject to the mortgage benefits as if the purchaser had paid the mortgage on the property. \\"We are ... concerned with the reality that an owner of property, mortgaged at a figure less than that at which the property will sell, must and will treat the conditions of the mortgage exactly as if they were his personal obligations. If he transfers subject to the mortgage, the benefit to him is as real and substantial as if the mortgage were discharged, or as if a personal debt in an equal amount had been assumed by another.\\" Importance This case supports the doctrine of U.S. income tax law that a seller of property subject to a nonrecourse debt (as opposed to a recourse debt where the seller may remain liable for any unsatisfied balance remaining after the transfer) realizes an amount that includes the debt assumed by the purchaser. This is an important concept because a large percentage of real property is held subject to a mortgage or other debt and, therefore, the debt must be dealt with as a part of the sale of such property. As a result, when property encumbered by debt is sold, the tax consequences of the passing of the debt have a significant effect on the overall tax consequences of the sale. For example, in this case, a taxpayer who sold an apartment building for $3,000 was forced to recognize taxable income of over $24,000. Of course, the case also had the unintended collateral effect of legitimizing the idea that a taxpayer can purchase depreciable property with nonrecourse debt, a purchase the risk of which is largely borne by the lender, and (possibly) of realizing the interim tax benefit associated with increased depreciation and amortization deductions. The result in Crane is specifically limited to situations where the property mortgage was less than the value of the property mortgaged. See footnotes 37 and 42. The reasoning cited, that the taxpayer will treat the property as his own in order to protect his equity investment, has been called the \\"Crane Economic Benefit Rule.\\" That reasoning was turned on its head 36 years later in the case Commissioner v. Tufts, 461 U.S. 300 (1983), which addressed the situation that Crane had left unresolved.

More specifically, it has been found on the coasts of England, Ireland, Scotland, Iceland, Greenland, Denmark, Norway, Japan, China, Korea, Canada, and the United States. Ecological Alaria is typically found in the sublittoral zones, at a depth of .Fredersdorf, J., Muller, R., Becker, S., Wiencke, C., Bischof, K. (2009). Interactive effects of radiation, temperature and salinity on different life history stages of the Arctic kelp Alaria esculenta (Phaeophyceae). Oecologia, 160, 483-492. An important factor in Alaria‚Äôs distribution is temperature; it is limited by sea temperature of 16¬∞C. and greater. Presumably due to this factor, and rising sea temperatures, the genus has largely disappeared from the English Channel within the past 100 years. Recent research conducted on Alaria esculenta in the Arctic showed pronounced temperature effects on the photosynthesis and germination of the algae. Life history As with all kelps, Alaria demonstrate a heteromorphic, sporic life history, with a macroscopic, dominant sporophyte, and a microscopic gametophyte. Unique to the genus Alaria is that the sori of the unilocular sporangia are restricted to certain blades, the sporophylls. The sporophylls are formed as lateral blades from the stipe. Most species are perennial; after reproduction, the blade sloughs off, leaving the stipe and meristem. The persisting meristem produces a new blade at the beginning of the next growing season.Bold, H.C., Wynne, M.J. (1985). ‚Äò‚ÄôIntroduction to the Algae‚Äô‚Äô.

It was designed by architect Randall Stout. History In 1947, the Roanoke chapter of the American Association of University Women requested a major exhibition from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, which moved part of its staff and permanent collection to The Hotel Roanoke for a period of time. In 1951, the Roanoke Fine Arts Center was incorporated as an independent organization. Between 1952‚Äì1954, the Roanoke Fine Arts Center used the City of Roanoke's Library to exhibit an Allen Ingles Palmer retrospective and other exhibitions. The Roanoke Fine Arts Center opened offices and studios at 715 Franklin Road in Roanoke in 1954. A year later, in 1955, the Roanoke Fine Arts Center moved into a new facility at the corner of 25th Street and Carolina Avenue in South Roanoke. The building was donated by Mr. and Mrs. J. Meade Harris. In 1965, Anne Funkhouser Francis donated her family estate, Cherry Hill, to the Roanoke Fine Arts Center and to the Junior League. The first exhibition at Cherry Hill was of works by Thomas Eakins, borrowed from his Roanoke relatives. From 1965‚Äì1976, the Roanoke Fine Arts Center exhibited the works of regional artists, as well as works by such nationally recognized figures as Andy Warhol and Edward Steichen. A permanent collection began to develop with gifts of art from local collectors and the City of Roanoke. In 1976, the Roanoke Fine Arts Center received full accreditation from the American Association of Museums and celebrated its 25th anniversary. In 1983, renamed the Roanoke Museum of Fine Arts, the museum relocated to Center in the Square on Market Square in downtown Roanoke. The new location, larger in size and with more gallery space for the permanent collection, opened the museum to new and broader audiences from across the region. In 2001 the museum received the long-promised Peggy Macdowell Thomas bequest, which included 27 works associated with major American artist Thomas Eakins and his circle and funds to support a named gallery; in 2007 Mrs. Thomas‚Äô house and its contents also came to the museum, providing further artwork and financial support. In 2002, the Art Museum announced that Randall Stout had been selected as design architect for the Art Museum‚Äôs new facility. On March 21, 2005, the Art Museum unveiled the design for its new 81,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility in downtown Roanoke. Construction of the new facility began in May 2006. On February 6, 2008, the Board of Trustees of the institution announced that the new building was to be named in honor of the former CEO of Advance Auto Parts and later the U.S. Ambassador to Romania, Nicholas F. Taubman, and Mrs. Eugenia L. Taubman in recognition of their lead gift to the capital campaign. Museum staff moved into the Taubman Museum of Art on September 8, 2008.

The Fralin Center for American Art consists of ten galleries that house special exhibitions as well as its renowned permanent collection. The center is named in honor of Horace G. and Ann H. Fralin. The City of Roanoke Atrium is a 1,600 square feet space used for large installations. The museum maintains three galleries devoted to the display and discussion of works from the permanent collection. The galleries change their content to ensure that a broad and diverse array of artwork created by internationally respected artists is continually accessible to the public, with 15‚Äì20 rotations per year. Art Venture, adjacent to the atrium, is a 2,436 square foot interactive gallery space that contains 13 discovery centers for children and families. Collection and exhibitions The permanent collection of more than 2,000 works of art includes prominent 19th- and early 20th-century American art, as well as significant modern and contemporary art, photography, design, and decorative arts, and several smaller collections including Southern folk art. The American art collection dates from the mid-19th through the second quarter of the 20th century, providing exemplary works from the Hudson River, American Realism, American Impressionism, and Arts and Crafts art movements; works by self-taught artists are a small but important subsection to this collection. American artists include Thomas Eakins, Winslow Homer, Childe Hassam, Maurice Prendergast, John Singer Sargent, Robert Henri, Norman Rockwell, George Inness, Eduard Steichen, and Thomas Hart Benton. The modern and contemporary collection includes works by Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Jacob Lawrence, Romare Bearden, John Cage, Audrey Flack, and Dorothy Gillespie.

It is one of the tallest buildings in Cairo. The Marriott opened in 1983, but its central wing was built as the Gezirah Palace for the Khedive Isma'il Pasha in 1869 and converted to a luxury hotel in 1894. Hotel Zamelek Tower and the open-air theatre from Gezira Tower The hotel consists of 1,087 rooms, making it one of the largest hotels in the Middle East. The rooms are located in two identical twenty-story buildings‚Äîthe Gezira and Zamelek Towers. Situated between them on ground level is the palace and main entrance to the hotel, which‚Äîafter reconstruction‚Äînow contains the reception and administration areas. On the roof of the palace is an open-air theatre which faces the Nile and central Cairo. The hotel is also used for meetings and events; it has 19 meeting rooms and event venues that total more than 28,000 sq ft of space.  History  The Ghezireh Palace Hotel - 1906 The Gezirah Palace was commissioned by Khedive Ismail and designed by Carl von Diebitsch to host French Emperor Napoleon III and his wife Empress Eug√©nie during the celebration of the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Ismail asked the architect to make it resemble the Palace of Versailles. In 1880, the palace was seized by Ismail's creditors. It was eventually leased to the Compagnie Internationale des Grands Hotels, who opened it as The Ghezireh Palace Hotel in October 1894. During World War I, the hotel served as the No.2 Australian General Hospital, after the Mena House was unable to cope with the huge number of casualties from the Battle of Gallipoli. In 1919, The Ghezireh Palace Hotel was sold to Syrian businessman Habib Lotfallah and converted back to a private residence. The palace was nationalized by Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1952 and eventually converted back to a hotel, reopening in 1962 as the Omar Khayyam Hotel. In the late 1970s, the two large towers were added and the entire hotel was rebuilt. President Hosni Mubarak presided over the grand reopening in 1983 as the Cairo Marriott Hotel.

The commission established limits on Biomedical research such that pregnant women and their fetus' were not harmed by researchers or exposed to any form of risk. The commission further established that the health of a pregnant woman or her fetus could not be compromised under any circumstance for the purposes of research no matter how minute the perceived risk may be. Furthermore, the commission suggested lifting the moratorium imposed on abortion research at that time under the condition that no inducements were offered to subjects to undergo an abortion for the purpose of research. However research on a dead fetus or dead fetal tissue was approved. Lastly, non-therapeutic research upon a pregnant woman or fetus was approved only under the extenuating circumstance that important biomedical knowledge could not be obtained through any other means and that permission was granted to researchers by the subject.The Hastings Center. \\"Commission Recommendations.\\" The Hastings Center Report 5.3 (1975): 45-46.

History The club was founded in 1890 under the name Wallsend Park Villa. The team won the Gateshead Cup in 1893‚Äì94 and again the following season when they combined it with victory in the Northumberland Junior League. Until then, the team had played on open grounds, but an arrangement was made to rent the Wallsend Amateur Bicycle Club's enclosure. The club was afforded senior status in 1895, and joined the Tyneside League. The team played in both the FA Cup and the FA Amateur Cup for the first time in 1896. They lost to Leadgate Exiles in the preliminary round of the FA Cup, and in the Amateur Cup, received a bye in the first qualifying round and beat Rutherford College in the second before being eliminated by Shankhouse in the third. They also reached the final of the Northumberland Senior Cup, losing to Willington Athletic; they were to win the trophy for the first and only time in 1901‚Äì02. Wallsend were admitted to the Northern Alliance when Southwick resigned just before the 1896‚Äì97 season was due to start. They lost their first match 8‚Äì1, but recovered to finish third. They continued in the top half of the table, building up to a runners-up place in 1902‚Äì03 and winning the league title the following season. After four more seasons, which included another runners-up finish, in 1906‚Äì07, Wallsend joined the North Eastern League. They began with three mid-table finishes, but then slumped to 18th of 19 in 1911‚Äì12. A change of name, to plain Wallsend F.C., preceded a return to mid-table, but they finished bottom of the league in the two seasons before competition was abandoned for the duration of the First World War. In the six seasons after the war, Wallsend's best placing was 15th of 20, although they did reach the fifth qualifying round of the FA Cup on three occasions. After finishing bottom in 1924‚Äì25, having conceded more than 100 goals in 38 matches, they left the North Eastern League and joined the Northern Alliance, only to return a season later, as the Alliance was absorbed into the North Eastern League as its second division. Wallsend were promoted as runners-up to Washington Colliery in 1927‚Äì28. After four seasons in mid-table at the higher level, they finished bottom in 1932‚Äì33 and were relegated, at which point the shareholders decided that the club, which had a deficit of ¬£732, should be voluntarily wound up. A successor club, formed shortly afterwards under the name of Wallsend Town A.F.C., also struggled financially. The team spent two seasons in the North Eastern League Second Division, then returned for one season to the re-formed Northern Alliance, in which they finished 10th of 12.

It runs from Le Puy-en-Velay, south west of St Etienne to Saint-Gilles-du-Gard to the south west of N√Æmes, a distance of 211 kilometres or 140 miles. The origin of its name is most likely that of the ancient Province through which it passes ‚Äì la Regordana. This Province corresponded approximately to the triangular area linking the towns of Al√©s, Pradelles and Largenti√®re. Its existence dates back to the dawn of man and its importance certainly grew from the year 843 onwards, when it became the most easterly route of a nascent Gaul. The Regordane was the fourth most important pilgrimage route in Christendom during this era, bolstered by its strategic position as a point of departure for Santiago de Compostela, the Holy Land (St Gilles was a port at the time) and Rome. GR 700 The GR 700 is France's newest Grande Randonn√©e route that follows approximately the pilgrimage path of the Chemin de St-Gilles and the mystical trail, The Regordane. The Saint-Gilles Way dates back to the mid-9th century and was Christendom's fourth most important pilgrimage by the 11th century. It runs from Le Puy-en-Velay to Saint-Gilles du Gard in Camargue. The Regordane is a section of this trail that runs between Luc in Lozere and Al√®s at the foothills of the C√©vennes. The GR 700 runs from Le Puy en Velay to Saint- Gilles du Gard, but is not necessarily faithful to the original trails. The whole route uses the misnomer 'The Regordane Way.' This epithet is incorrect because it implies that the full route was formerly known as The Regordane, which was never the case. Moreover, the use of the word 'Way' implies a Roman origin (Way = Voie) which studies demonstrate is wrong. Sources * Marcel GIRAULT. Le Chemin de R√©gordane. N√Æmes, Lacour, 3e √©d. 1988.

Especially, it is a robust spatial discretization method for simulating multi- phase (solid-fluid-gas) interactions. In the MPM, a continuum body is described by a number of small Lagrangian elements referred to as 'material points'. These material points are surrounded by a background mesh/grid that is used only to calculate gradient terms such as the deformation gradient. Unlike other mesh-based methods like the finite element method, finite volume method or finite difference method, the MPM is not a mesh based method and is instead categorized as a meshless/meshfree or continuum-based particle method, examples of which are smoothed particle hydrodynamics and peridynamics. Despite the presence of a background mesh, the MPM does not encounter the drawbacks of mesh-based methods (high deformation tangling, advection errors etc.) which makes it a promising and powerful tool in computational mechanics. The MPM was originally proposed, as an extension of a similar method known as FLIP (a further extension of a method called PIC) to computational solid dynamics, in the early 1990 by Professors Deborah L. Sulsky, Zhen Chen and Howard L. Schreyer at University of New Mexico. After this initial development, the MPM has been further developed both in the national labs as well as the University of New Mexico, Oregon State University, University of Utah and more across the US and the world. Recently the number of institutions researching the MPM has been growing with added popularity and awareness coming from various sources such as the MPM's use in the Disney film Frozen.  The algorithm  An MPM simulation consists of the following stages: (Prior to the time integration phase) # Initialization of grid and material points. ## A geometry is discretized into a collection of material points, each with its own material properties and initial conditions (velocity, stress, temperature, etc.) ## The grid, being only used to provide a place for gradient calculations is normally made to cover an area large enough to fill the expected extent of computational domain needed for the simulation. (During the time integration phase - explicit formulation) # Material point quantities are extrapolated to grid nodes. ## Material point mass (m_{mp}), momenta (\\\\vec{P_{mp}}), stresses (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\bar{\\\\bar{\\\\sigma}}}_{mp}), and external forces (\\\\vec{b}) are extrapolated to the nodes at the corners of the cells within which the material points reside. This is most commonly done using standard linear shape functions (N_{nd-mp}), the same used in FEM. ## The grid use the material point values to create the masses (M_{node}), velocities (\\\\vec{V_{node}}), internal and external force vectors (\\\\vec{F_{node}^{\\\\mathsf{internal}}},\\\\vec{F_{node}^{\\\\mathsf{external}}}) for the nodes: M_{node} = \\\\sum_{mp} m_{mp} ~~ N_{mp-nd} \\\\vec{V_{node}} = {1 \\\\over M_{node}} ~~ \\\\sum_{mp} \\\\vec{P_{mp}} ~~ N_{mp-nd} \\\\vec{F_{node}^{internal}} = \\\\sum_{mp} ~~\\\\bar{\\\\bar{\\\\sigma}}_{mp} ~~ abla N_{mp-nd} \\\\vec{F_{node}^{\\\\mathsf{external}}} = \\\\sum_{mp} \\\\vec{b}~~N_{mp-nd} # Equations of motion are solved on the grid. ## Newton's 2nd Law is solved to obtain the nodal acceleration (\\\\vec{A_{node}})\\\\vec{A_{node}} = {\\\\vec{F^{external}_{node}+\\\\vec{F^{internal}_{node}} \\\\over M_{node}}} ## New nodal velocities are found (\\\\tilde{\\\\vec{V_{node}}}).\\\\tilde{\\\\vec{V_{node}}} = \\\\vec{V_{node}} + \\\\vec{A_{node}}\\\\mathrm d t # Derivative terms are extrapolated back to material points ## Material point acceleration (\\\\vec{a_{mp}}), deformation gradient (\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{\\\\bar{F_{mp}}}}) (or strain rate (\\\\bar{\\\\bar{\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}_{mp}}}) depending on the strain theory used) is extrapolated from the surrounding nodes using similar shape functions to before (N_{nd-mp}). \\\\vec{a_{mp}} = \\\\sum_{nd} \\\\vec{A_{node}} ~~N_{nd-mp} \\\\bar{\\\\bar{\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}_{mp}}} = \\\\sum_{nd} ~{1 \\\\over 2}~~[\\\\vec{V_{node}} abla N_{nd-mp} + (V_{node} abla N_{nd-mp})^T ] ## Variables on the material points: positions, velocities, strains, stresses etc. are then updated with these rates depending on integration scheme of choice and a suitable constitutive model. # Resetting of grid. #: Now that the material points are fully updated at the next time step, the grid is reset to allow for the next time step to begin. History of PIC/MPM The PIC was originally conceived to solve problems in fluid dynamics, and developed by Harlow at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1957. One of the first PIC codes was the Fluid- Implicit Particle (FLIP) program, which was created by Brackbill in 1986 and has been constantly in development ever since. Until the 1990s, the PIC method was used principally in fluid dynamics. Motivated by the need for better simulating penetration problems in solid dynamics, Sulsky, Chen and Schreyer started in 1993 to reformulate the PIC and develop the MPM, with funding from Sandia National Laboratories. The original MPM was then further extended by Bardenhagen et al.. to include frictional contact, which enabled the simulation of granular flow, and by Nairn to include explicit cracks and crack propagation (known as CRAMP). Recently, an MPM implementation based on a micro-polar Cosserat continuum has been used to simulate high-shear granular flow, such as silo discharge. MPM's uses were further extended into Geotechnical engineering with the recent development of a quasi-static, implicit MPM solver which provides numerically stable analyses of large- deformation problems in Soil mechanics.Beuth, L., Coetzee, C.J., Bonnier, P. and van den Berg, P. \\"Formulation and validation of a quasi-static material point method.\\" In 10th International Symposium on Numerical Methods in Geomechanics, 2007. Annual workshops on the use of MPM are held at various locations in the United States. The Fifth MPM Workshop was held at Oregon State University, in Corvallis, OR, on April 2 and 3, 2009. Applications of PIC/MPM The uses of the PIC or MPM method can be divided into two broad categories: firstly, there are many applications involving fluid dynamics, plasma physics, magnetohydrodynamics, and multiphase applications. The second category of applications comprises problems in solid mechanics. Fluid dynamics and multiphase simulations The PIC method has been used to simulate a wide range of fluid-solid interactions, including sea ice dynamics, penetration of biological soft tissues,Ionescu, I., Guilkey, J., Berzins, M., Kirby, R., and Weiss, J. \\"Computational simulation of penetrating trauma in biological soft tissues using MPM.\\" fragmentation of gas-filled canisters, dispersion of atmospheric pollutants, multiscale simulations coupling molecular dynamics with MPM, and fluid-membrane interactions. In addition, the PIC-based FLIP code has been applied in magnetohydrodynamics and plasma processing tools, and simulations in astrophysics and free-surface flow. As a result of a joint effort between UCLA's mathematics department and Walt Disney Animation Studios, MPM was successfully used to simulate snow in the 2013 computer-animated film Frozen. Solid mechanics MPM has also been used extensively in solid mechanics, to simulate impact, penetration, collision and rebound, as well as crack propagation. MPM has also become a widely used method within the field of soil mechanics: it has been used to simulate granular flow, quickness test of sensitive clays, landslides, silo discharge, pile driving, fall-cone test, bucket filling, and material failure; and to model soil stress distribution, compaction, and hardening. It is now being used in wood mechanics problems such as simulations of transverse compression on the cellular level including cell wall contact. The work also received the George Marra Award for paper of the year from the Society of Wood Science and Technology. Classification of PIC/MPM codes=MPM in the context of numerical methods One subset of numerical methods are Meshfree methods, which are defined as methods for which \\"a predefined mesh is not necessary, at least in field variable interpolation\\". Ideally, a meshfree method does not make use of a mesh \\"throughout the process of solving the problem governed by partial differential equations, on a given arbitrary domain, subject to all kinds of boundary conditions,\\" although existing methods are not ideal and fail in at least one of these respects. Meshless methods, which are also sometimes called particle methods, share a \\"common feature that the history of state variables is traced at points (particles) which are not connected with any element mesh, the distortion of which is a source of numerical difficulties.\\" As can be seen by these varying interpretations, some scientists consider MPM to be a meshless method, while others do not. All agree, however, that MPM is a particle method. The Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) methods form another subset of numerical methods which includes MPM. Purely Lagrangian methods employ a framework in which a space is discretised into initial subvolumes, whose flowpaths are then charted over time. Purely Eulerian methods, on the other hand, employ a framework in which the motion of material is described relative to a mesh that remains fixed in space throughout the calculation. As the name indicates, ALE methods combine Lagrangian and Eulerian frames of reference. Subclassification of MPM/PIC PIC methods may be based on either the strong form collocation or a weak form discretisation of the underlying partial differential equation (PDE). Those based on the strong form are properly referred to as finite- volume PIC methods. Those based on the weak form discretisation of PDEs may be called either PIC or MPM. MPM solvers can model problems in one, two, or three spatial dimensions, and can also model axisymmetric problems. MPM can be implemented to solve either quasi-static or dynamic equations of motion, depending on the type of problem that is to be modeled. Several versions of MPM include Generalized Interpolation Material Point Method ;Convected Particle Domain Interpolation Method; Convected Particle Least Squares Interpolation Method. The time-integration used for MPM may be either explicit or implicit. The advantage to implicit integration is guaranteed stability, even for large timesteps. On the other hand, explicit integration runs much faster and is easier to implement. Advantages=Compared to FEM Unlike FEM, MPM does not require periodical remeshing steps and remapping of state variables, and is therefore better suited to the modeling of large material deformations. In MPM, particles and not the mesh points store all the information on the state of the calculation. Therefore, no numerical error results from the mesh returning to its original position after each calculation cycle, and no remeshing algorithm is required. The particle basis of MPM allows it to treat crack propagation and other discontinuities better than FEM, which is known to impose the mesh orientation on crack propagation in a material. Also, particle methods are better at handling history-dependent constitutive models. Compared to pure particle methods Because in MPM nodes remain fixed on a regular grid, the calculation of gradients is trivial. In simulations with two or more phases it is rather easy to detect contact between entities, as particles can interact via the grid with other particles in the same body, with other solid bodies, and with fluids. Disadvantages of MPM MPM is more expensive in terms of storage than other methods, as MPM makes use of mesh as well as particle data. MPM is more computationally expensive than FEM, as the grid must be reset at the end of each MPM calculation step and reinitialised at the beginning of the following step. Spurious oscillation may occur as particles cross the boundaries of the mesh in MPM, although this effect can be minimized by using generalized interpolation methods (GIMP). In MPM as in FEM, the size and orientation of the mesh can impact the results of a calculation: for example, in MPM, strain localisation is known to be particularly sensitive to mesh refinement. One stability problem in MPM that does not occur in FEM is the cell-crossing errors and null-space errors because the number of integration points (material points) does not remain constant in a cell.

While the instrumentation mode allows more accurate statistics to be gathered, it also makes the program run more slowly while being profiled. The VSTS profiler helps to optimize performance of code targeted for the .NET platform or natively compiled Visual C++ code. Modern versions of the VSTS profiler can be used to profile both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows programs. The profiler reports performance characteristics for methods which are called during a given run of the profiler including the number of calls to the function and the call stack when the function was called. From within the profiler, the application is launched and executed normally for a period of time. When the user decides to exit the program, the profiler gives a summary of the number of times that each function was called, the elapsed time of each function, and the memory consumed by objects.

The clan was key in helping the foundation of the Goryeo Kingdom in the 10th century. Although the clan gained its initial power during Goryeo Dynasty, it became less prominent during the Joseon era. Not all Koreans with the family name Shin today belong to the Pyeongsan Shin clan. Only about 600,000 Shins, or about 70% of all Shins hail from this clan. Others belong to other unrelated clans, such as the Goryeong Shin clan, who produced such 19th and 20th century notables as Shin Chae-ho. Painting of Sa An-Do : Shin Sung-Gyeom hitting a goose with an arrow above Pyeongsan, Korea Clan history during the Goryeo period (918-1392) The Pyeongsan Shin clan is a Korean yangban (aristocratic) family, which takes its root during the 10th century Goryeo dynasty. At the beginning of the Goryeo period, the country was divided in several kingdoms fighting for supremacy over the Korean peninsula. The founder of the clan is generally accepted to be General Shin Sung-gyeom, who helped King Wang Geon found the Goryeo Kingdom by dethroning the tyrant Gung Ye, alongside Hyeon Gyeong, Hong Yu and Bok Ji-geom in 918.Korean Architecture: Shin Sung-kyom shrine, Daegu As described on an official description plate at his memorial shrine in the province of Gangwon-do, Shin Sung-gyeom died around 927 in a battle in modern- day Daegu, fighting bravely in the king's clothes to save King Wang Geon (also referred to as King Taejo), who formally founded the Goryeo Kingdom in the same year. After his death, the King bestowed upon Shin's son and Shin's brother the high aristocratic title of Jangjolgong. According to the legend, the clan name of Pyeongsan Shin was given to Shin Sung-gyeom before his death, during a hunting trip with King Wang Geon. A skillful archer, Shin successfully hit \\"the left wing of the third goose among the flying geese over there.\\"‚ÄúWarriors Who Changed the National History‚Äù, Hwang Won-gap, Indie Book, 655 pages, 2002 Wang Geon was impressed and bestowed Shin with the land area, Pyeongsan, where the geese were flying over, and that is how the family line of Shin of Pyeongsan originated.ÌèâÏÇ∞Ïã†Ïî® ÌèâÏÇ∞Îã∑Ïª¥ The land of Pyeongsan is currently situated in the North Korean province of Hwanghae.

As other yangbans of the time, members of the Pyeongsan Shin clan successfully passed the gwageo, or national civil service examinations. There was no hereditary aristocracy in Korea during the Joseon Dynasty, as the bureaucracy was filled by tested and certified professionals.

Prior to the NFL, in 1949 Willie Irvin attended Florida A& M University (then known as Florida A & M College) on a football scholarship where he was coached by the legendary Jake \\"The Snake\\" Gaither, one of the most winning coaches in the history of college football. Coach Gaither was known for not playing freshmen, however, during his freshman year Willie Irvin was sent into a game to replace an injured end by Assistant Coach Hansel \\"Tootie\\" Tookes. Known by the nickname \\"Big Train\\", on his first play, Willie Irvin made an interception, ran 55 yards to score a touchdown and was a starter for that time on. In 1995, Wilie Irvin was inducted into FAMU's Sports Hall of Fame for football. Although he attended FAMU on a football scholarship, Willie Irvin also played on the basketball team. He and three teammates Thomas \\"Butch\\" Hogan, Charles \\"Trick Shot\\" White, and John \\"Turk\\" Culyer made FAMU history by defeating Alabama State in the 1952 Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SIAC) Tournament. Due to FAMU players having fouled out, Willie Irvin (who had four personal fouls himself) and his three teammates played for more than 13 minutes with only four men on the court. After playing into double overtime, the four-man team defeated Alabama State 71-67. Willie Irvin and his three teammates were inducted into FAMU's Sports Hall of Fame in 2001 as the \\"Famed Final Four of 1952,\\" at which time Jake Gaither stated that \\"this was the greatest display of determination by any Rattlers squad.\\" For his athletic achievements, Willie Irvin was also inducted into the Palm Beach County, Florida Sports Hall of Fame. Upon graduating from FAMU in 1953, Willie Irvin was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles where he played as a defensive back until he was drafted by the Army. After being honorably discharged from the Army, Willie Irvin got his master's degree and became a coach, teacher and eventually a career school administrator, retiring from the school system after 34 years.

It lies between South Wimbledon and Colliers Wood in the London Borough of Merton. Merton Abbey takes its name from Merton Priory, which once stood on the northern edge of the district. The area is bounded by Merton High Street to the north, the River Wandle to the west, Christchurch Road to the east and Deen City Farm to the south. Despite the area being considered by many to be part of neighbouring Colliers Wood, most of Merton Abbey falls within Merton's \\"Lavender Fields\\" ward. The area is within the SW postcode area. History :For a history of this part of the borough, see Merton. Most of what is now the Merton Abbey residential area fell within the grounds of Merton Priory. The priory was founded by Gilbert Norman, the Sheriff of Surrey in 1114 and was built on the southern edge of the Roman Road known as Stane Street. Merton Priory remained an important centre of learning in the area until it was sacked by King Henry VIII in 1538. Surviving sections of the old priory wall can still be found in many of the area's gardens, especially near Liberty Avenue. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the ruins of the sacked priory were gradually replaced by mills as heavy industry developed along the River Wandle. The south of the neighbourhood consisted mainly of lavender fields. In the 18th century, the river itself was diverted from its original course and many waterways were created to drive the multitude of silk mills and bleaching works that had sprung up along this portion of the Wandle Valley. To assist the local industries, the world's first railway line, the Surrey Iron Railway opened in 1803 and ran up what is now Christchurch Road. The line closed in 1838. Merton Abbey, as a residential suburb, was developed in the 1930s, sitting to the south of the Liberty Print Works and Merton Board Mills. The neighbourhood was extended to the south with the addition of Brangwyn Crescent and neighbouring cul-de-sacs in the 1980s. This period also witnessed the demolition of Merton Board Mills, which was replaced by the Sainsbury's Savacentre. Merton Abbey station and railway line were also removed at this time and the line was replaced by the Merton relief road, Merantun Way. Liberty Print Works were eventually refurbished and converted into the Merton Abbey Mills craft village. In recent years, the remainder of the brownfield site to the east of Merton Abbey Mills has been developed into a residential complex which includes luxury apartments, a hotel, a gymnasium and several restaurants. Transport The area sits equidistantly between Colliers Wood and South Wimbledon stations on the London Underground Northern line. Frequent buses connect the neighbourhood to Wimbledon town centre, as well as Morden, Mitcham, Richmond, Tooting and Clapham. Wimbledon station's District line, National Rail and Tramlink services are located a mile and a half to the northwest. Until it was closed in 1929 the area was served by Merton Abbey railway station on the now defunct 'Merton Branch Line' between Merton Park railway station and Tooting Junction.

In the summer of 2016, Bet365 also signed shirt sponsorship deals with Bulgarian clubs Ludogorets Razgrad and Slavia Sofia for the upcoming two seasons. Bet365's reported figures to March 2018 showing amounts wagered on sports at ¬£52.56 billion, revenues of ¬£2.86 billion and an operating profit of ¬£660.3 million. Denise Coates, joint chief executive, continues to run Bet365 and is the majority shareholder with 50.1% of the shares. Her brother John, joint chief executive, runs the business alongside her, with her father Peter holding the position of chairman. As of 2020, Bet365 is one of the first gambling companies to offer the option of early payout. Awards and achievements At the eGaming Review Operator Awards 2010 organised by eGaming Review magazine, Bet365 won the \\"Operator of the Year\\" award. Bet365 ranked third in The Sunday Times Profit Track 100 league table, which ranks private companies in the UK based on profit growth rate. Bet365 was also ranked as one of the fastest growing privately owned technology, media and telecoms companies in The Sunday Times Tech Track 100 league table. eGaming Review magazine has ranked Bet365 the number one Internet gaming company in 2010, 2011 and 2012 as part of its annual Power 50 list of the top 50 most influential Internet gaming companies. Denise Coates, founder and joint CEO of Bet365, received a CBE in the 2012 Queen's new year honours list for services to the community and business. In February 2013 Denise Coates was named as one of the 100 most powerful women in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour at BBC Radio 4. Controversies In October 2014, The Guardian newspaper reported that the company had been taking bets from Chinese citizens by using obscure domain names in order to avoid government web censorship. In 2016, Bet365 were fined $2.75 million AUD for misleading advertisements which falsely promised \\"free bets\\" to customers. Denise Coates became the highest paid executive in the UK in 2017, awarding herself a salary of ¬£217m. In 2018, her pay packet rose to ¬£265m as the company reported profits up 31% to ¬£660m, prompting criticism from problem gambling charity groups. In January 2019, Bet365 ranked second on The Sunday Times list of the UK‚Äôs top taxpayers, with the Coates family ‚Äì Denise, John and Peter ‚Äì paying an estimated total tax of ¬£156 million, of which ¬£99 million was paid by Denise alone. Further criticism highlights repeated cases of Bet365 delaying or outright denying payment to winning players. For example, Bet365 was taken to court for refusing to pay over ¬£1 million in winnings to a horse bettor in Northern Ireland in 2017. The company refused a payout of ¬£54,000 to a punter in England in 2016, a case which is still ongoing as of 2017. In Australia, Bet365 froze the account and refused to pay a punter who had won around $200,000 AUD in 2016. These are just some of the most noteworthy instances; several more cases of Bet365 refusing to pay winnings have been reported by gamblers on Internet gambling forums.

The second Notable (MSO-460) was laid down 8 June 1953 by Higgins, Inc., New Orleans, Louisiana; launched 15 October 1954 sponsored by Mrs. deLesseps G. Morrison, wife of the Mayor of New Orleans; and commissioned 8 June 1955, Lt. John E. Murdock in command.  East Coast operations  Following shakedown out of Charleston, South Carolina, Notable served as a training ship for the Navy School of Mine Warfare, Norfolk, Virginia. Returning to Charleston on 18 November 1955, the mine sweeper operated with the U.S. 2nd Fleet in the Western Atlantic Ocean for the next two years, and then, on 9 January 1958, deployed to the Mediterranean for a six-month cruise with the U.S. 6th Fleet, returning 23 June. Temporarily assigned to the Loran \\"B Experimental Development Force in October and November 1958, Notable operated off the U.S. East Coast until 18 September 1959 when she entered Norfolk Navy Yard for overhaul.  North Atlantic operations  Engaging in Atlantic Ocean amphibious exercises in early 1960, and her second six months deployment to the Mediterranean, the ship departed Charleston in January 1961 for minesweeping exercises and a Caribbean cruise. Calling at ports in the Virgin Islands and the British West Indies, Notable sailed to Cape Canaveral, Florida, in April to assist Project Mercury Forces in the launching of America's first man in space, Lt. Comdr. Alan B. Shepard, USN. For the remainder of the year, the minesweeper operated off Florida, overhauling at Jacksonville, Florida, from July to October and deploying 6 January 1962 for another Caribbean cruise. She returned to Charleston 1 May, and operated off the Atlantic coast patrolling during the Cuban Missile Crisis in November 1962. On 17 September 1963 Notable, in company with other ships of Mine Division 85 departed Charleston for the Mediterranean.  Caribbean and Mediterranean operations  The minesweeper returned to Charleston 1 March 1964 and on completion of overhaul in late June of 1965, she deployed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba for refresher training for a month with a one week visit to Port Antonio, Jamaica. In early August of 1965 she returned to Charleston. In early September she departed Charleston for New York City where she ported at Brooklyn Navy Yard for minor preparations for two weeks, from there she continued to Portsmouth, New Hampshire for mine sweeping exercises, returning to Charleston in early October of 1965. On 24 January 1966 she departed for her fourth Mediterranean deployment. Arriving Rota, Spain, 21 February, the ship was immediately ordered to participate in the search for a nuclear bomb lost in an air collision off Palomares. The minesweeper remained on this duty until salvage was completed 30 March. She then made goodwill visits to ports in Italy and France, and participated in intensive amphibious training until returning to Charleston 14 July.  Later operations  Notable sailed 19 September for extensive minesweeping exercises off New England. This operation was immediately followed by a cruise to Puerto Rico where she joined other U.S. 2nd Fleet ships in \\"Operation LantFlex66\\", a full-scale mock invasion of Vieques Island. The minesweeper returned to Charleston 15 December and operated out of there for the next year.  Decommissioning  Notable was decommissioned (date unknown) and was stricken from the Navy List 1 February 1971. She was sold for scrap in 1971.

Formed in 1945, it was dissolved in 1958. It was formed in 1945 from the merger of the Agrarian Party, the Popular Freedom Alliance (an offshoot of the National Socialist Movement of Chile), the Movimiento Nacionalista de Chile and the Uni√≥n Nacionalista.Garay, Cristi√°n. 1990. El Partido Agrario Laborista. 1945-1958. Editorial Andr√©s Bello. Santiago. (pages 133-135) Its foundational program, emphasising law and order, asserted the need to \\"secure public order in the country, on the functional basis that labour has not only obligations but also indisputable civil rights.\\" In 1951 the PAL proclaimed as its presidential candidate the former dictator Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo, who had, since his first term, somehow changed political orientation. After his election in 1952, it took part in his first cabinet, along with the Popular Socialist Party formed of dissidents of the Socialist Party. Starting in 1954, the PAL's influence on Ib√°√±ez's cabinet declined, leading to an internal crisis and to the subsequent use of the PAL label by two different organizations. Legally, the ownership of the PAL label was among the faction opposing Ib√°√±ez, led by the senator Julio von M√ºhlenbrock. New divisions split the PAL for the 1958 presidential election, with the official faction supporting the candidate of the Christian Democrat Party, Eduardo Frei Montalva, while activists from Caut√≠n and Biob√≠o and dissidents who formed the Partido Agrario Laborista Recuperacionista (Recover Agrarian Labor Party) supported the right-wing candidate Jorge Alessandri, along with the United Conservative Party and the Liberal Party. The PAL subsequently dissolved itself in October 1958, merging with the National Party to create the PANAPO (Partido Nacional Popular, National People's Party). The PANAPO itself was dissolved in 1961, a faction joining the Christian Democrats, while another merged with the PADENA (Partido Democr√°tico Nacional, National Democratic Party) which joined the left-wing FRAP coalition. Finally, a third tendency attempted to maintain the original party, without any success. A group tried to revive the PAL for the 1965 parliamentary election under the label of Partido Democracia Agrario Laborista, but did not manage in obtaining any political representation.

As both a quadroon and M√©tis, he was famed in the African diaspora at the beginning of the 20th century as an example of African leadership. From 1892 to 1894, he led the conquest of Dahomey, one of West Africa's most powerful pre-colonial states, against King B√©hanzin. Close to the French Radical Party, Alfred Dodds owed his nomination as expedition leader to the personal intervention of powerful French politician Georges Clemenceau.  Biography = Early life  Dodds was born on 6 February 1842 in Saint-Louis, Senegal. His father was Antoine Henri Dodds, a merchant, and director of the Saint-Louis post office, a quadroon and of M√©tis descent; his mother was Charlotte de la Chapelle, a signare of French and African descent. He was the eldest of 10 children. His paternal grandfather was John Dodds, a British Army officer and aide-de-camp to the last English governor of Saint-Louis. John Dodds was married to a Senegalese woman of French and African descent.  Military career  Dodds graduated from the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in 1862.

He made captain in December 1869. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, his military prowess was noted at the Blue Division when he was made Knight of the Legion of Honour. Captured, he escaped after the capitulation of the Battle of Sedan, and rejoined the Arm√©e de la Loire and later the Arm√©e de l'Est. He was held in Switzerland at the end of the war. Dodds in Dahomey in 1892 He served in Senegal from 1871 to 1878, in Cochinchina from 1878 to 1879.

Then made a lieutenant colonel, he served in the war of conquest in Tonkin. A colonel in 1887, he served in the counter-insurgency warfare in the Fouta Djalon in French Guinea. He was decorated Commander of the Legion of Honour in 1891 and was given command of the Eighth Colonial Army in Toulon.

It is located at 270 B-U Drive, about two miles south of Buckhannon city limits. The school offers grades 9-12, and serves all of Upshur County and some students from surrounding counties. Mr. Jonathan Pollock serves as principal of Buckhannon- Upshur High School. History Buckhannon High School began in a wood frame building on East Main Street in Buckhannon in 1881. The school remained in the wooden building until 1909 with the construction of a new facility on College Avenue. A gymnasium was added in 1922. In 1925 Upshur High School opened its doors on Route 20 about one mile south of Buckhannon High. Buckhannon High, a 7-12 school, was designated for the city kids; Upshur High, a 9-12 school, was designated for the county, or country kids. Prior to the great depression, each West Virginia county had several district school boards. To save on expenses each county was consolidated into its own school district. As part of this action, the Upshur County School Board consolidated the two schools in 1933, creating Buckhannon-Upshur High School. The city and county students continued to meet in separate buildings until 1958, but all extracurricular activities, such as band and athletics met together as Buckhannon-Upshur High School. In the early 1920s, Victoria High School, the school for Upshur County's black population, burned down. A faulty heating system was to blame. No students were present at the time of the incident. The first school was located on Victoria Street less than one block from Buckhannon High School. A new 1-12 grade facility was built on Baxter Street near WV Wesleyan College. After World War 2 Upshur County's black population dwindled considerably. Many black families left, seeking jobs in northern industrial areas. With just three or four black high school students in the county, it was decided that they should be bused to Kelley-Miller School in Clarksburg, so that racial segregation could be maintained. In 1954 Upshur County's school system was integrated. The few Upshur County black students were integrated into the city branch of Buckhannon-Upshur High School without incident. In 1958 extensive renovations took place at the Upshur, or county, branch of B-UHS and all high school students began meeting in one facility in grades 10-12. The Buckhannon, or city, building became Buckhannon-Upshur Junior High School that same year, housing all Upshur County students in grades 7-9. In 1977 a new campus for Buckhannon-Upshur High School was built two miles south of the old B-UHS on Route 20. It began housing grades 9-12 that year. Renovations were made to the school that had housed B-UHS since 1958, and Buckhannon-Upshur Middle School was created, housing students grades 6-8. The Buckhannon-High that was built in 1909 was condemned in 1977, largely due to its inability to meet modern fire safety standards. It was used for storage until it was torn down in the early 1990s. The original 1881 wooden facility was moved several yards south and used to house a portion of the elementary students attending East Main Street Elementary until it was demolished in the 1970s. Mascot and colors The school's mascot is the Buccaneer. Local newspapers began referring to the B-UHS football and basketball teams as Buccaneers in 1934. The nickname soon ran into controversy in 1941. Some local citizens felt it was inappropriate for high school students to be associated with pirates. The nickname was changed to the Blue Eagles in 1941 and remained so until 1946. In 1947 the Buccaneer mascot was brought back by popular demand and has remained ever since. When the first football team was organized at Buckhannon High School in 1909, the school colors were blue and gray. Upshur High School got its first football team in 1926 and chose red and white as its colors. When the two schools merged in 1933, they also merged the colors. Blue and white became the official colors of Buckhannon-Upshur High School and have remained to this day. Fight song \\"Here Comes the Blue and White\\" (to the tune of the 1940s song \\"Weenie Man\\") Here comes the Blue and White To win this game tonight They'll win it any old time To keep their rep up high!

Proud and Free we cry, Hail to thee our Alma Mater, Hail our B-U High, Hail our B-U High! (hum first stanza, and repeat) PRO- officer As of the 2009-2010 school year, B-UHS received a PRO-officer through a grant with the Upshur County Sheriff's Department. This officer assists at the school and goes into the classrooms to talk with students about issues associated with underage drinking, drug use, and other illegal activities. The officer is armed with a pistol, and a collapsible police baton. In 2017 the pro officer was given a k-9 named Buck. Sports programs BUHS offers sports including football, cross-country (boys' and girls') basketball (boys' and girls'), soccer (boys' and girls'), swimming (boys' and girls'), wrestling, golf, baseball, softball, cheerleading, and lacrosse (boys' and girls'). Football started in 1909, and boys' basketball in 1912. Girls' basketball started in 1919, but was discontinued after the 1929 season and the onset of the Depression. Girls' sports reemerged in the early 1970s. * The Buckhannon-Upshur Buccaneer football team has won five West Virginia state championships, in 1915, 1918, 1924, 1963 AAA, and 1966 AAA. * The boys' basketball team won state titles in 1921 and 1922. * The baseball team won state titles in 1937 and 1972. * The golf team won state championships in 1980, 1981 and 1982. * The boys' soccer team won state titles in 1993, 1994 and 1995. * The boys' cross-country team won its state championship in 1993. * The girls' track team won the AAA state championship in 2010, 2011 and 2013. * The boys' basketball team was runner-up to the state champions in 1916, 1918 and 1919. * The baseball team was runner-up in 1941 and 1957. * The football team was AAA runner-up in 1969. * The girls' track team was AAA runner-up in 1989, 1990, 1992, 2007, and 2012 * The girls' cross-country team was AAA runner-up in 1987 and 1991. * The girls' soccer team was runner-up in 1995. * The boys' swim team was runners-up in 2000. * The girls' lacrosse team was CLUB runner-up in 2010 and 2011. * The girls basketball team was AAA runner-up in 2017. * As of Fall 2010, Buckhannon-Upshur will leave the North Central Athletic Conference and will return to the Big 10 Conference in school athletics. Buckhannon High was a charter member of the Big 10 in 1930 and remained at B-UHS until 1986. As the Big 10 Conference expanded to 14 teams, disputes over equal access to titles between big and small school led to six bigger schools, including B-UHS, exiting the conference and creating the North Central Athletic Conference (NCAC)in 1986. In 2010, B-UHS and four other schools reentered the Big 10. *Buckhannon-Upshur added girls and boys club lacrosse teams in 2008.

He played in all four divisions of the Football League, making nearly 500 league appearances for his two clubs. Life and career Frain was born in Yardley, Birmingham. He joined Birmingham City from school, made his debut in the First Division in April 1986 aged 17, and signed full professional forms in October of that year. He was originally a left back, but good passing ability and a lack of pace saw him moved into midfield, towards the end of his Birmingham career returning to left-back. He was the club's free kick and penalty specialist. He was part of the team that won the Associate Members' Cup in 1990-91 and gained promotion from the Third Division in 1991‚Äì92.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 226. He was the club's Player of the Year for 1994. He also appeared in the club's 1994‚Äì95 Third Division championship-winning season and in the early rounds of that year's Football League Trophy, but played insufficient games to qualify for a league medal and did not play in the final.Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 230, 245. In 1996, he was awarded a testimonial match against Aston Villa in recognition of ten years' service. He made 336 appearances for the club in all competitions, scoring 28 goals. In January 1997 Frain joined Northampton Town on loan, writing himself into the club's history by scoring a stoppage-time winner from a free kick in that season's Third Division play-off final. His free-transfer move to the club was made permanent at the end of that season. He later played his part in the club winning automatic promotion back to the Second Division in 1999‚Äì2000.

Pre-Columbian periodReligious freedom The Colombian Constitution of 1991 abolished the previous condition of the Roman Catholic Church as state church, and it includes two articles providing for freedom of worship: * Art. 13: States that \\"all people are legally born free and equal\\" and that they will not be discriminated on the basis of \\"sex, race, national or familial origin, language, religion, political or philosophical opinion\\". * Art. 19: Which expressly guarantees freedom of religion. \\"Freedom of religion is guaranteed. Every individual has the right to freely profess his/her religion and to disseminate it individually or collectively. All religious faiths and churches are equally free before the law.\\" Catholic Christianity Christianity (Catholicism) was the official religion of the country from the Spanish colonization until the 1991 constitutional reform (National Constituent Assembly), which granted egalitarian treatment from the government to all the religions. However, Catholicism is still the main religion in Colombia by number of adherents, with an estimated 70% of the national population in nominal Catholicism, from which about 25% are practicing Catholics. In the colonial period, the Catholic Church was created and in charge of most of the public institutions, such as teaching facilities (schools, colleges, universities, libraries, botanical gardens, astronomical observatories); health facilities (Hospitals, nurseries, leper hospitals) and jails. It also \\"inherited\\" a huge amount of land, approx. 1/4 of all the productive land, which was later acquired by the government. Colombia is often referred as the \\"Country of the Sacred Heart\\", due to the annual consecration of the country to the Sacred Heart of Jesus in a Te Deum directed by the president of the republic. Colombia has been re-consecrated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and consecrated to the Immaculate Heart of Mary in 2008, in a country-wide ceremony celebrated by the main bishops and with the presence of the Colombian president (also a Catholic). Protestant Christianity Protestantism, primarily Evangelicalism, now represents 13% of the Colombian populace, and is growing faster than the national growth rate. \\"Evangelicos\\" (as they are called in Colombia) hold to the authority of the Bible. Many of them belong to Pentecostal churches, but other churches are active as well. Bah√° º√≠ Faith The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Colombia begins with references to the country in Bah√° º√≠ literature as early as 1916, with Bah√° º√≠s visiting as early as 1927. The first Colombian joined the religion in 1929 and the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in Bogot√° in 1944 with the beginning of the arrival of coordinated pioneers from the United States and achieved an independent National Spiritual Assembly in 1961. By 1963 there were eleven local assemblies. In the 1980s institutions were developed in Colombia that have influenced activities inside and independent of the religion in other countries: FUNDAEC and the Ruhi Institute. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 68,000 Bah√° º√≠s (0.2% of the population) in 2005. Islam Approximately 100,000 adheres to Islam according to some. There are a number of Islamic organizations in Colombia, including Islamic in San Andr√©s, Barranquilla, Bogot√°, Guajira, Nari√±o, and Santa Marta. There are also primary and secondary Islamic schools in Bogot√° and Maicao. Maicao plays host to the continent's third largest mosque, the Mosque of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab. Most Muslims in Colombia are either of Arab or Madurese descent. Other religious affiliations Various denominations have their own statistics: * Seventh-day Adventist Church: 270,256 members as of June 30, 2017http://www.adventistdirectory.org/ViewAdmField.aspx?AdmFieldID=CLUC Retrieved July 2, 2018http://adventistdirectory.org/ViewAdmField.aspx?AdmFieldID=SOCO Retrieved July 2, 2018 * The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: 193,350 members (2016) * Jehovah's Witnesses: about 165,089 members (2015) * Bah√° º√≠ Faith: about 70,500 (2010) * Judaism: between 5,000 and 10,000 members * Buddhism: approximately 9,000 Bogot√° Latter-Day Saints Temple Although the government does not keep official statistics on religious affiliation, a 2010 limited survey found * 70.0% Catholic * 0.9% Charismatic Catholic * 14.4% Evangelical Christian * 1.6% Pentecostal * 0.3% Charismatic Evangelicals * 0.4% Protestant * 2.5% Agnostic * 2.2% Atheist * 3.5% Theistic but no religion * 1.3% Jehovah's Witnesses * 0.5% Adventist * 0.1% Muslim * 2.2% no response As of 2013, there seems to be no social controversy or problem arising from religious conflict. Religious discrimination is prohibited by the constitution and there is no official religion; however, the state is also explicitly not supposed to be indifferent to religious sentiments and the Catholic church has a special status. All cities and towns in Colombia have a church, but there are also some temples, mosques and synagogues in the largest cities. A Colombian-grown Taoist movement has spread significantly in recent years. In the 2000s, temples and congregations were target of a paramilitary repression whose motivations are still unclear. Entire Taoist communities were massacred and leaders kidnapped. In 2008 Taoist communities organised and participated to various peaceful protests in some cities of Colombia.  Religious statistics  The National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) does not collect religious statistics, and accurate reports are difficult to obtain. However, based on various studies and a survey, about 90% of the population adheres to Christianity, the majority of which (70.9%) are Roman Catholic, while a significant minority (16.7%) adhere to Protestantism (primarily Evangelicalism). Some 4.7% of the population is atheist or agnostic, while 3.5% claim to believe in God but do not follow a specific religion. 1.8% of Colombians adhere to Jehovah's Witnesses and Adventism and less than 1% adhere to other religions, such as Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Mormonism, Hinduism, Indigenous religions, Hare Krishna movement, Rastafari movement, Orthodox Catholic Church, and spiritual studies. The remaining people either did not respond or replied that they did not know. In addition to the above statistics, 35.9% of Colombians reported that they did not practice their faith actively. Based on a 2010 survey in \\"major cities throughout the country, many mid-size cities, and the rural region of Uraba\\". While Colombia remains a mostly Roman Catholic country by baptism numbers, the 1991 Colombian constitution guarantees freedom of religion and all religious faiths and churches are equally free before the law.Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title II ‚Äì Concerning rights, guarantees, and duties ‚Äì Chapter I ‚Äì Concerning fundamental rights ‚Äì Article 19) Syncretism in Colombia Some syncretic or native religious figures in the country are: The healing ghost of Jos√© Gregorio Hern√°ndez, the Purgatory souls (Animas del Purgatorio), the Lonely Soul (Anima Sola), the Powerful hand, the Black Christ of Buga, Valle del Cauca, 20 July Baby Jesus (Divine Infant Jesus), Father Marianito (beatified Mariano de Jesus Euse Hoyos 1845-1926),http://www.teleantioquia.com.co/TeleantioquiaensuRegion/Norte2005/PadreMarianito.htm Padre Marianito the fertility rites of St Isidro and local variations of syncretism from other countries, such as Santer√≠a and Maria Lionza cult.CaribbeanInside.com: Cult to Maria Lionza Gallery Image:Basilica- buga.jpgThe Black Christ Icon in the Basilica of Se√±or de los Milagros (Buga, Valle del Cauca) is visited by thousands of people every week Image:Virgen de chiquinquira2.jpgOur Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquir√° (16th century).

During the 1958-59 season Healey, billed as \\"Michael Healey\\", replaced Douglas Fowley as Doc Holliday in the popular ABC/Desilu western series The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, starring Hugh O'Brian in the title role. Earlier, on September 25, 1956, Healey played the drunken gunfighter Clay Allison in an episode of the same name on The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp. From 1959 to 1961, he played Maj. Peter Horry, top aide to Leslie Nielsen, in the miniseries Swamp Fox on Walt Disney Presents, based on the American Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion. In 1970 Healey appeared as Wardlow in the TV western \\"The Men From Shiloh\\" (the rebranded name of The Virginian) in the episode titled \\"Jenny.\\" Collectively, Healey appeared in some 140 films, including 81 westerns and three serials. Among his non-western pictures, he appeared in at least two horror films: the Americanized version of the Japanese giant-monster movie Varan the Unbelievable (1958) and The Incredible Melting Man (1977). Death In 2005, Healey broke his hip in a fall and never recovered. He died at the age of 82 at a hospital near his home in Simi Valley, California. Recognition In 2000, Healey received a Golden Boot Award for his contributions to Western films and television programs.

The vessel spent her entire career on the East Coast of Canada. Following her Canadian service, Tupper was sold to private interests with the intention of converting her to a yacht, but the conversion never happened and the vessel moved about Halifax Harbour, suffering a fire in 2008 before being sold for scrap in 2011. Design and description Tupper and sister ship were long overall with a beam of and a draught of . The vessel had a fully loaded displacement of and a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 1,358. The vessels were powered by a diesel-electric system driving two screws creating . This gave the vessels a maximum speed of . The ships were fitted with a flight deck and a telescopic hangar and were capable of operating one helicopter. Service history The buoy tender's keel was laid down in March 1959 by Marine Industries at their yard in Sorel, Quebec with the yard number 257. Tupper was launched on 3 October 1959, named for a former Prime Minister of Canada. The ship entered service with the Department of Transport on 1 December 1959. In 1962 the Department of Transport's Marine Service fleet was merged into the newly formed Canadian Coast Guard and Tupper was given the new prefix CCGS. Tupper was active in servicing the navigation aids of Atlantic Canada as well as operating in heavy ice conditions in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and St. Lawrence River, and also acted as a harbour cleanup vessel. She occasionally traveled to the north. Earlier in her career she was stationed in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Fate The ship was taken out of service in 1997 and used as alongside training ship at CCG Dartmouth Base, renamed 1998-05 until 1999 when she was sold to an American interest and renamed MV Caruso intended for conversion to a yacht. The vessel changed owners a couple of times, never leaving Halifax Harbour, changing piers until 11 October 2008 when a large fire broke out aboard Tupper while she was moored, requiring the services of the Canadian navy's firefighting ship . The blaze was deemed suspicious and partially gutted the vessel. In 2011 the hulk was sold for scrap to be broken up in Marie Joseph, a small community in the Eastern Shore region of Nova Scotia.

Science communicators and audiences are ambiguously defined and the expertise and level of science knowledge varies with each group. Two types of defined science communication are science outreach (typically conducted by professional scientists to non-expert audiences) and science \\"inreach\\" (expert to expert communication from similar or different scientific backgrounds). An example of inreach is scholarly communication and publication in scientific journals. Science communication may generate support for scientific research or study, and inform decision making, including political and ethical thinking. There is increasing emphasis on explaining methods rather than simply findings of science. This may be especially critical in addressing scientific misinformation, which spreads easily because it is not subject to the constraints of scientific method. Science communicators can use entertainment and persuasion including humour, storytelling and metaphors. Scientists can be trained in some of the techniques used by actors to improve their communication. Motivations Writing in 1987, Geoffery Thomas and John Durant advocated various reasons to increase public understanding of science, or scientific literacy. More trained engineers and scientists could allow a nation to be more competitive economically. Science can also benefit individuals. Science can simply have aesthetic appeal (e.g., popular science or science fiction). Living in an increasingly technological society, background scientific knowledge can help to negotiate it. The science of happiness is an example of a field whose research can have direct and obvious implications for individuals. Governments and societies might also benefit from more scientific literacy, since an informed electorate promotes a more democratic society. Moreover, science can inform moral decision making (e.g., answering questions about whether animals can feel pain, how human activity influences climate, or even a science of morality). In 1990, Steven Hilgartner, a scholar in science and technology studies, criticized some academic research in public understanding of science. Hilgartner argued that what he called \\"the dominant view\\" of science popularization tends to imply a tight boundary around those who can articulate true, reliable knowledge. By defining a \\"deficient public\\" as recipients of knowledge, the scientists get to emphasize their own identity as experts, according to Hilgartner. Understood in this way, science communication may explicitly exist to connect scientists with the rest of society, but science communication may reinforce the boundary between the public and the experts (according to work by Brian Wynne in 1992Wynne, Brian (1992). \\"Misunderstood misunderstanding: Social identities and public uptake of science\\", Public Understanding of Science, vol. 1 (3): 281‚Äì304. See also Irwin, Alan & Wynne, Brian (eds) (1996) Misunderstanding Science (Cambridge & New York: Cambridge University Press). and Massimiano Bucchi in 1998Massimiano Bucchi (1998) Science and the Media (London & New York: Routledge).). In 2016, the scholarly journal Public Understanding of Science ran an essay competition on the \\"deficit model\\" or \\"deficit concept\\" of science communication and published a series of articles answering the question \\"In science communication, why does the idea of a public deficit always return?\\" in different ways; for example, Carina Cortassa's essay argued that the deficit model of science communication is just a special case of an omnipresent problem studied in social epistemology of testimony, the problem of \\"epistemic asymmetry\\", which arises whenever some people know more about some things than other people. Science communication is just one kind of attempt to reduce epistemic asymmetry between people who may know more and people who may know less about a certain subject. Biologist Randy Olson said in 2009 that anti-science groups can often be so motivated, and so well funded, that the impartiality of science organizations in politics can lead to crises of public understanding of science. He cited examples of denialism (for instance, climate change denial) to support this worry.(23 October 2009.) \\"Randy Olson ‚Äì Don't Be Such a Scientist.\\" (Includes podcast). Pointofinquiry.org. Accessed May 2012. Journalist Robert Krulwich likewise argued in 2008 that the stories scientists tell compete with the efforts of people such as Turkish creationist Adnan Oktar. Krulwich explained that attractive, easy to read, and cheap creationist textbooks were sold by the thousands to schools in Turkey (despite their strong secular tradition) due to the efforts of Oktar.Miller, Lulu (29 July 2008).\\"Tell Me a Story.\\" (Includes podcast). Radiolab.org. Accessed May 2012. Astrobiologist David Morrison has spoken of repeated disruption of his work by popular anti-scientific phenomena, having been called upon to assuage public fears of an impending cataclysm involving an unseen planetary object‚Äîfirst in 2008, and again in 2012 and 2017. Methods Walter Lewin demonstrates conservation of potential energy. It can be difficult to captivatingly share good scientific thinking as well as scientifically accurate information. Krulwich and Olson believe scientists must rise to that challenge using metaphor and story telling. Marine biologist and film-maker Randy Olson published Don't Be Such a Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style. In the book he describes how there has been this unproductive negligence when it comes to teaching scientists to communicate. Don't be Such a Scientist is written to his fellow scientists, and he says they need to \\"lighten up\\". He adds that scientists are ultimately the most responsible for promoting and explaining science to the public and media. This, Olson says, should be done according to a good grasp of social science; scientists must use persuasive and effective means like story telling. Olson acknowledges that the stories told by scientists need not only be compelling but also accurate to modern science‚Äîand says this added challenge must simply be confronted. He points to figures like Carl Sagan as effective popularizers, partly because such figures actively cultivate a likeable image. Science popularization figures such as Carl Sagan and Neil deGrasse Tyson are partly responsible for the view of science or a specific science discipline within the general public. However, the degree of knowledge and experience a science popularizer has can vary greatly. Because of this, some can depend on sensationalism. As a Forbes contributor put it, \\"The main job of physics popularizers is the same as it is for any celebrity: get more famous.\\" Because of this variation in experience, research scientists can sometimes question the credibility of science popularizers. Another point in the controversy of popular science is the idea of how public debate can affect public opinion. A relevant and highly public example of this is climate change. A science communication study appearing in The New York Times proves that \\"even a fractious minority wields enough power to skew a reader's perception of a [science news] story\\" and that even \\"firmly worded (but not uncivil) disagreements between commenters affected readers' perception of science.\\" This causes some to worry that the popularizing of science in the public, questioning whether the further popularization of science will cause pressure towards generalization or sensationalism. Unfortunately, this question will fall to time for an answer. At his commencement address to Caltech students, journalist Robert Krulwich delivered a speech entitled \\"Tell me a story\\". Krulwich says that scientists are actually given many opportunities to explain something interesting about science or their work, and that they must seize such opportunities. He says scientists must resist shunning the public, as Sir Isaac Newton did in his writing, and instead embrace metaphors the way Galileo did; Krulwich suggests that metaphors only become more important as the science gets more difficult to understand. He adds that telling stories of science in practice, of scientists' success stories and struggles, helps convey that scientists are real people. Finally, Krulwich advocates for the importance of scientific values in general, and helping the public to understand that scientific views are not mere opinions, but hard-won knowledge. Actor Alan Alda helps scientists and PhD students get more comfortable with communication with the help of drama coaches (they use the acting techniques of Viola Spolin).Grushkin, Daniel (5 August 2010). \\"Try acting like a scientist\\" The Scientist Magazine. Accessed May 2012. Matthew Nisbet describes the use of opinion leaders as intermediaries between scientists and the public as a way to reach the public via trained individuals who are more closely engaged with their communities, such as \\"teachers, business leaders, attorneys, policymakers, neighborhood leaders, students, and media professionals.\\" Examples of initiatives that take this approach include Science & Engineering Ambassadors, sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences, and Science Booster Clubs, coordinated by the National Center for Science Education. Imagining science's publics In the preface of The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins wrote: \\"Three imaginary readers looked over my shoulder while I was writing, and I now dedicate the book to them. [...] First the general reader, the layman [...] second the expert [and] third the student\\". Students explain science projects to visitors. Susanna Hornig promotes the message that anyone can meaningfully engage with science, even without going as deeply into it as the researchers themselves do.Priest, Susanna Hornig (2009) \\"Reinterpreting the audiences for media messages about science\\", in Richard Holliman et al. (eds), Investigating Science Communication in the Information Age: Implications for Public Engagement and Popular Media (Oxford: Oxford University Press), 223‚Äì236. Many criticisms of the public understanding of science movement have emphasized that this thing they were calling the public was somewhat of an (unhelpful) black box. Approaches to the public changed with the move away from the public understanding of science. Science communication researchers and practitioners now often showcase their desire to listen to non-scientists as well as acknowledging an awareness of the fluid and complex nature of (post/late) modern social identities.For example, see: Irwin, Alan & Michael, Mike (2003). Science, Social Theory and Public Knowledge (Maidenhead & Philadelphia: Open University Press). chapter 6 At the very least, people will use plurals: publics or audiences. As the editor of the scholarly journal Public Understanding of Science put it in a special issue on publics: > We have clearly moved from the old days of the deficit frame and thinking of > publics as monolithic to viewing publics as active, knowledgeable, playing > multiple roles, receiving as well as shaping science. (Einsiedel, 2007: 5) However, Einsiedel goes on to suggest both views of the public are \\"monolithic\\" in their own way; they both choose to declare what something called the public is. Some promoters of public understanding of science might have ridiculed publics for their ignorance, but an alternative \\"public engagement with science and technology\\" romanticizes its publics for their participatory instincts, intrinsic morality or simple collective wisdom. As Susanna Hornig Priest concluded in her 2009 introduction essay on science's contemporary audiences, the job of science communication might be to help non- scientists feel they are not excluded as opposed to always included; that they can join in if they want, rather than that there is a necessity to spend their lives engaging. The process of quantifiably surveying public opinion of science is now largely associated with the public understanding of science movement (some would say unfairly).Martin Bauer, Nick Allum and Steve Miller, \\"What can we learn from 25 years of PUS survey research? Liberating and expanding the agenda\\", Public Understanding of Science, volume 16, 2007, pages 79‚Äì95. In the US, Jon Miller is the name most associated with such work and well known for differentiating between identifiable \\"attentive\\" or \\"interested\\" publics (that is to say science fans) and those who do not care much about science and technology. Miller's work questioned whether the American public had the following four attributes of scientific literacy: * knowledge of basic textbook scientific factual knowledge * an understanding of scientific method * appreciated the positive outcomes of science and technology * rejected superstitious beliefs, such as astrology or numerologyMartin Bauer, Nick Allum and Steve Miller, \\"What can we learn from 25 years of PUS survey research? Liberating and expanding the agenda\\", Public Understanding of Science, volume 16, 2007, pages 80‚Äì81. In some respects, John Durant's work surveying British public applied similar ideas to Miller. However, they were slightly more concerned with attitudes to science and technology, rather than just how much knowledge people had.For example: They also looked at public confidence in their knowledge, considering issues such as the gender of those ticking \\"don't know\\" boxes. We can see aspects of this approach, as well as a more \\"public engagement with science and technology\\" influenced one, reflected within the Eurobarometer studies of public opinion. These have been running since 1973 to monitor public opinion in the member states, with the aim of helping the preparation of policy (and evaluation of policy). They look at a host of topics, not just science and technology but also defense, the euro, enlargement of the European Union, and culture. Eurobarometer's 2008 study of Europeans' Attitudes to Climate Change is a good example.(September 2008.) \\"Europeans' attitudes towards climate change.\\" European Parliament and European Commission (accessed in May 2012). It focuses on respondents' \\"subjective level of information\\"; asking \\"personally, do you think that you are well informed or not about‚Ä¶?\\" rather than checking what people knew. Frame analysis Science communication can be analyzed through frame analysis, a research method used to analyze how people understand situations and activities. Some features of this analysis are listed below. * Public accountability: placing a blame on public actions for value, e.g. political gain in the climate change debate * Runaway technology: creating a certain view of technological advancements, e.g. photos of an exploded nuclear power plant * Scientific uncertainty: questioning the reliability of a scientific theory, e.g. arguing how bad global climate change can be if humans are still aliveSee, for example, Nisbet, Matthew C. (March/April 2009). \\"Communicating Climate Change: Why Frames Matter for Public Engagement\\". Environment. Retrieved 20 October 2010.  Heuristics  People make an enormous number of decisions every day, and to approach all of them in a careful, methodical manner is impractical. They therefore often use mental shortcuts known as \\"heuristics\\" to quickly arrive at acceptable inferences.Fiske, S. T., & Taylor, S. E. (1991). Social Cognition (2nd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill. Tversky and Kahneman originally proposed three heuristics, listed below, although there are many others that have been discussed in later research. * Representativeness: used to make assumptions about probability based on relevancy, e.g. how likely item A is to be a member of category B (is Kim a chef?), or that event C resulted from process D (could the sequence of coin tosses H-H-T-T have occurred randomly?). * Availability: used to estimate how frequent or likely an event is based on how quickly one can conjure examples of the event. For example, if one were asked to approximate the number of people in your age group that are currently in college, your judgment would be affected by how many of your own acquaintances are in college. * Anchoring and adjustment: used when making judgments with uncertainties. One will start with an anchoring point, then adjust it to reach an assumption. For example, if you are asked to estimate how many people will take Dr. Smith's biology class this spring, you may recall that 38 students took the class in the fall, and adjust your estimation based on whether the class is more popular in the spring or in the fall. The most effective science communication efforts take into account the role that heuristics play in everyday decision-making. Many outreach initiatives focus solely on increasing the public's knowledge, but studies have found little, if any, correlation between knowledge levels and attitudes towards scientific issues.Scheufele, D. A. (2006). Messages and heuristics: How audiences form attitudes about emerging technologies. In J. Turney (Ed.), Engaging science: Thoughts, deeds, analysis and action (pp. 20‚Äì25). London: The Wellcome Trust.  Science in popular culture and the media  This diagram, designed by alt=The diagram, designed by Thomas Edison in 1880, is intended to depict the workings of a light bulb.  Birth of public science  While scientific study began to emerge as a popular discourse following the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, science was not widely funded or exposed to the public until the nineteenth century. Most science prior to this was funded by individuals under private patronage and was studied in exclusive groups, like the Royal Society. Public science emerged due to a gradual social change, resulting from the rise of the middle class in the nineteenth century. As scientific inventions, like the conveyor belt and the steam locomotive entered and enhanced the lifestyle of people in the nineteenth century, scientific inventions began to be widely funded by universities and other public institutions in an effort to increase scientific research. Since scientific achievements were beneficial to society, the pursuit of scientific knowledge resulted in science as a profession. Scientific institutions, like the National Academy of Sciences or the British Association for the Advancement of Science are examples of leading platforms for the public discussion of science. David Brewster, founder of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, believed in regulated publications in order to effectively communicate their discoveries, \\"so that scientific students may know where to begin their labours.\\" As the communication of science reached a wider audience, due to the professionalization of science and its introduction to the public sphere, the interest in the subject increased.  Scientific media in the 19th century  There was a change in media production in the nineteenth century. The invention of the steam-powered printing press enabled more pages to be printed per hour, which resulted in cheaper texts. Book prices gradually dropped, which gave the working classes the ability to purchase them. No longer reserved for the elite, affordable and informative texts were made available to a mass audience. Historian Aileen Fyfe noted that, as the nineteenth century experienced a set of social reforms that sought to improve the lives of those in the working classes, the availability of public knowledge was valuable for intellectual growth. As a result, there were reform efforts to further the knowledge of the less educated. The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, led by Henry Brougham, attempted to organize a system for widespread literacy for all classes. Additionally, weekly periodicals, like the Penny Magazine, were aimed to educate the general public on scientific achievements in a comprehensive manner. Fredrich Koenig's steam powered printing press, 1814. As the audience for scientific texts expanded, the interest in public science did as well. \\"Extension lectures\\" were installed in some universities, like Oxford and Cambridge, which encouraged members of the public to attend lectures. In America, traveling lectures were a common occurrence in the nineteenth century and attracted hundreds of viewers. These public lectures were a part of the lyceum movement and demonstrated basic scientific experiments, which advanced scientific knowledge for both the educated and uneducated viewers. Not only did the popularization of public science enlighten the general public through mass media, but it also enhanced communication within the scientific community. Although scientists had been communicating their discoveries and achievements through print for centuries, publications with a variety of subjects decreased in popularity. Alternatively, publications in discipline- specific journals were crucial for a successful career in the sciences in the nineteenth century. As a result, scientific journals such as Nature or National Geographic possessed a large readership and received substantial funding by the end of the nineteenth century as the popularization of science continued.  Science communication in contemporary media  Science can be communicated to the public in many different ways. According to Karen Bultitude, a science communication lecturer at University College London, these can be broadly categorized into three groups: traditional journalism, live or face-to-face events, and online interaction. = Traditional journalism = Traditional journalism (for example, newspapers, magazines, television and radio) has the advantage of reaching large audiences; in the past, this is way most people regularly accessed information about science. Traditional media is also more likely to produce information that is high quality (well written or presented), as it will have been produced by professional journalists. Traditional journalism is often also responsible for setting agendas and having an impact on government policy. The traditional journalistic method of communication is one-way, so there can be no dialogue with the public, and science stories can often be reduced in scope so that there is a limited focus for a mainstream audience, who may not be able to comprehend the bigger picture from a scientific perspective. However, there is new research now available on the role of newspapers and television channels in constituting \\"scientific public spheres\\" which enable participation of a wide range of actors in public deliberations.Shiju Sam Varughese.2017. Contested Knowledge: Science, Media, and Democracy in Kerala. Oxford University Press, New Delhi. Another disadvantage of traditional journalism is that, once a science story is taken up by mainstream media, the scientist(s) involved no longer has any direct control over how his or her work is communicated, which may lead to misunderstanding or misinformation. Research in this area demonstrates how the relationship between journalists and scientists has been strained in some instances. On one hand scientists have reported being frustrated with things like journalists oversimplifying or dramatizing of their work, while on the other hand journalists find scientists difficult to work with and ill-equipped to communicate their work to a general audience. Despite this potential tension, a comparison of scientists from several countries has shown that many scientists are pleased with their media interactions and engage often. However, it is important to note the use of traditional media sources, like newspapers and television, has steadily declined as primary sources for science information, while the internet has rapidly increased in prominence. In 2016, 55% of Americans reported using the internet as their primary source to learn about science and technology, compared to 24% reporting TV and 4% reporting newspapers were their primary sources. Additionally, traditional media outlets have dramatically decreased the number of, or in some cases eliminated, science journalists and the amount of science-related content they publish. = Live or face-to-face events = The second category is live or face-to-face events, such as public lectures in museums or universities, debates, science busking, \\"sci-art\\" exhibits, Science Caf√©s and science festivals. Citizen science or crowd-sourced science (scientific research conducted, in whole or in part, by amateur or nonprofessional scientists) can be done with a face-to-face approach, online, or as a combination of the two to engage in science communication. Research has shown that members of the public seek out science information that is entertaining, but also helping citizens to critically participate in risk regulation and S&T; governance.Shiju Sam Varughese. 2017. Contested Knowledge: Science, Media, and Democracy in Kerala. Oxford University Press, New Delhi Therefore it is important to bear this aspect in mind when communicating scientific information to the public (for example, through events combining science communication and comedy, such as Festival of the Spoken Nerd, or during scientific controversies). The advantages of this approach are that it is more personal and allows scientists to interact with the public, allowing for two-way dialogue. Scientists are also better able to control content using this method. Disadvantages of this method include the limited reach, it can also be resource-intensive and costly and also, it may be that only audiences with an existing interest in science will be attracted. = Online interaction = The third category is online interaction; for example, websites, blogs, wikis and podcasts can be used for science communication, as can other social media. Online methods of communicating science have the potential to reach huge audiences, can allow direct interaction between scientists and the public, and the content is always accessible and can be somewhat controlled by the scientist. Additionally, online communication of science can help boost scientists' reputation through increased citations, better circulation of articles, and establishing new collaborations. Online communication also allows for both one-way and two-way communication, depending on the audience's and the author's preferences. However, there are disadvantages in that it is difficult to control how content is picked up by others, and regular attention and updating is needed. When considering whether or not to engage in science communication online, scientists should review what science communication research has shown to be the potential positive and negative outcomes. Online communication has given rise to movements like open science, which advocates for making science more accessible. However, when engaging in communication about science online, scientists should consider not publicizing or reporting findings from their research until it has been peer- reviewed and published, as journals may not accept the work after it has been circulated under the \\"Ingelfinger rule\\". Other considerations revolve around how scientists will be perceived by other scientists for engaging in communication. For example, some scholars have criticized engaged, popular scholars using concepts like the Sagan effect or Kardashian Index. Despite these criticisms, many scientists are taking to communicating their work on online platforms, a sign of potentially changing norms in the field.  Social media science communication  By using Twitter, scientists and science communicators can discuss scientific topics with many types of audiences with various points of view. Studies published in 2012 by Gunther Eysenbach shed light on how Twitter not only communicates science to the public but also affects advances in the science community. Alison Burt, editor in chief of Elsevier Connect, wrote a 2014 news article titled \\"How to use social media for science\\" that reported on a panel about social media at that year's AAAS meeting, in which panelists Maggie Koerth-Baker, Kim Cobb, and Danielle N. Lee noted some potential benefits and drawbacks to scientists of sharing their research on Twitter. Koerth-Baker, for example, commented on the importance of keeping public and private personas on social media separate in order to maintain professionalism online. Interviewed in 2014, Karen Peterson, director of Scientific Career Development at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center stressed the importance for scientists of using social networks such as Facebook and Twitter to establish an online presence. Kimberly Collins et al., writing in PLOS One in 2016, explained reasons why some scientists were hesitant to join Twitter. Some scientists were hesitant to use social media outlets such as Twitter due to lack of knowledge of the platform, and inexperience with how to make meaningful posts. Some scientists did not see the meaning in using Twitter as a platform to share their research or have the time to add the information into the accounts themselves. In 2016, Elena Milani created the SciHashtag Project, which is a condensed collection of Twitter hashtags about science communication. In 2017, a study done by the Pew Research Center found that about \\"a quarter of social media users (26%) follow science accounts\\" on social media. This group of users \\"places both more importance and comparatively more trust on science news that comes to them through social media\\". Scientists have also used other social media platforms, including Instagram and Reddit, to establish a connection with the public and discuss science.  The public understanding of science movement  Michael Faraday giving a Christmas Lecture at the Royal Institution (circa 1855). \\"Public understanding of science\\", \\"public awareness of science\\" and \\"public engagement with science and technology\\" are all terms coined with a movement involving governments and societies in the late 20th century. During the late 19th century, science became a professional subject and influenced by governmental suggestions. Prior to this, public understanding of science was very low on the agenda. However, some well-known figures such as Michael Faraday ran lectures aimed at the non-expert public, his being the famous Christmas Lectures which began in 1825. The 20th century saw groups founded on the basis they could position science in a broader cultural context and allow scientists to communicate their knowledge in a way that could reach and be understood by the general public. In the UK, The Bodmer Report (or The Public Understanding of Science as it is more formally known) published in 1985 by The Royal Society changed the way scientists communicated their work to the public. The report was designed to \\"review the nature and extent of the public understanding of science in the United Kingdom and its adequacy for an advanced democracy\\". Chaired by the geneticist Sir Walter Bodmer alongside famous scientists as well as broadcaster Sir David Attenborough, the report was evidenced by all of the major sectors concerned; scientists, politicians, journalists and industrialists but not the general public. One of the main assumptions drawn from the report was everybody should have some grasp of science and this should be introduced from a young age by teachers who are suitably qualified in the subject area. The report also asked for further media coverage of science including via newspapers and television which has ultimately led to the establishment of platforms such as the Vega Science Trust. In both the UK and the United States following the second world war, public views of scientists swayed from great praise to resentment. Therefore, the Bodmer Report highlighted concerns from the scientific community that their withdrawal from society was causing scientific research funding to be weak. Bodmer promoted the communication of science to a wider more general public by expressing to British scientists that it was their responsibility to publicize their research. An upshot of the publication of the report was the creation of the Committee on the Public Understanding of Science (COPUS), a collaboration between the British Association for the Advancement of Science, the Royal Society and the Royal Institution. The engagement between these individual societies caused the necessity for a public understanding of science movement to be taken seriously. COPUS also awarded grants for specific outreach activities allowing the public understanding to come to the fore. Ultimately leading to a cultural shift in the way scientists publicized their work to the wider non-expert community. Although COPUS no longer exists within the UK the name has been adopted in the US by the Coalition on the Public Understanding of Science. An organization which is funded by the US National Academy of Sciences and the National Science Foundation and focuses on popular science projects such as science cafes, festivals, magazines and citizen science schemes. In the European Union, public views on public-funded research and the role of governmental institutions in funding scientific activities were being questioned as the budget allocated was increasing. Therefore, the European Commission encouraged strongly and later obligated research organizations to communicate about their research activities and results widely and to the general public. This is being done by integrating a communication plan into their research project that increases the public visibility of the project using an accessible language and adapted channels and materials.

It is located along U.S. Route 33 between Penn Laird and Elkton, and sits at the base of the Massanutten. According to a number derived from the 2010 census standard, McGaheysville had an estimated population of 4,354 people. History The earliest records mentioning a settlement in the area date to 1716, when Governor Alexander Spotswood ventured west of the Blue Ridge Mountains on the Knights of the Golden Horseshoe Expedition. The first European-American to settle permanently in the area was Adam Miller (Mueller) (1703‚Äì1783), a native of Germany who arrived in 1726 and made his homestead near present-day Elkton. Later, several German and Dutch immigrants moved into the area. and a village began to grow up around the Upper Peaked Mountain Church, which had been established in the vicinity. Records from 1758 reveal that a Lutheran preacher, Reverend Lawrence Wartman, originally from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania was preaching in the McGaheysville area who had likely arrived the year before in 1757. He is widely believed to have been the first Lutheran preacher who settled in Rockingham County. In 1758 he was involved in a court case in Augusta County court to naturalize one of his congregation from the Upper Peaked Mountain Church he was stationed at in the McGaheysville vicinity. In 1762, Jacob Herman ceded land to both the Lutherans and the Reformed Church to build the Union Church in the area in conjunction, built in a part called \\"Stony Run\\". Reverend Philip Charles Van Gemunden, a German Reformed preacher, arrived in the county in 1762 and preached at the Upper Peaked Mountain church which had been established in the area which is now McGaheysville. After his death in 1764, he was succeeded by Charles Lang from Frederick, Maryland who bought a farm in Timberville and in the McGaheysville area. However he was a controversial figure who in 1771 was ordered to leave Virginia, leaving his more respectable wife behind. The village community that was beginning to grow around the church was originally named Ursulaburg after her. McGaheysville was named for surveyor Tobias Randolph McGahey, who came to the area as part of a Scotch-Irish colonization effort in 1801. Shortly thereafter he married innkeeper Eva Conrad, at whose tavern he had previously spent the night. In 1802 he established a post office using the name \\"McGaheysville\\" and gave the town its name. McGaheysville has been declared the \\"most difficult to pronounce\\" place name in the state of Virginia by Reader's Digest. McGaheysville saw almost no action in the American Civil War, save for a skirmish during the Shenandoah Valley Campaign, on April 27, 1862, involving one section of an artillery battery of New York Militia; it is, however, located near to the site of the Battle of Cross Keys, and consequently soldiers from both the Union Army and the Confederate Army passed through during the campaign.Story of a Cannoneer Under Stonewall Jackson, Edward A. Moore. Geography Map of McGaheysville (click three times to view clearly) McGayeysville lies in northern central Virginia in the northeastern United States. It lies along the U.S. Route 33, between Penn Laird to the west and Elkton to the east. This road is part of the Spotswood Trail which leads from Harrisonburg located several kilometres beyond Penn Laird to the west. McGaheysville is located near the south fork of Shenandoah River in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley. The land to the immediate south of the village consists primarily of farmland but beyond that is the mountainous Shenandoah National Park. The area immediately north of the village is mountainous with the peak of Massanutten, located just to the northeast. Pikey Mountain, even nearer to the village than Massanutten, is located in the northeastern part of McGaheysville. Facilities Several buildings in McGaheysville date to 1840. The town is currently home to an elementary school, completed in 1969 and built on the site of the former high school, which had been destroyed by fire in 1968. McGaheysville has a volunteer fire department, which hosts a weekly bingo and an annual three-day lawn party in the summer when families turn up to enjoy live music, rides and games and eat. The adjacent resort of Massanutten, which began operations in 1971, plays an important role in the local economy, fuelled by tourism all year round with its 14 ski trails, 36 holes of golf, a water park which opened in October 2005 and other facilities. The resort has its origins in the late 1960s when John L. Hopkins II, a wealthy local landowner from McGaheysville, realized the economic potential of Massanutten Peak one day after viewing it through the farmhouse kitchen window and attracted investors to build a resort of 5,200 acres. Cave Hill Farm, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is located in the vicinity of McGaheysville. Notable people *Thomas G.

The population in 2011 was 3,509,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica (INE), Census 2011 results according to the 2013 administrative division of Portugal in an area of 25.45 km¬≤. History The only visible remnant of Canas de Senhorim's municipal authority, the pillory that resides in the town square The Baroque-era parochial church of the Saviour () A foral (charter) was issued in April 1196 by King Sancho I, and later confirmed by King Manuel I that granted the region the status of municipality, including its one parish. Canas de Senhorim was a municipality by the 19th century, when the parish of Carvalhal Redondo was annexed. Eventually, its municipal status was extinguished on 9 December 1852; both the municipality of Canas de Senhorim and Senhorim, were included in the reconstituted municipality of Nelas. Fifteen months later, following the decree, the municipality was no more. Canas was elevated to the status of vila (town) with the passing of bill 15128, on 21 March 1928, at the same time that the civil parish of Santar received its status. For a better part of the 20th century, Canas de Senhorim was known for its persistent fight to restore its municipal status. A movement was formed to challenge Nelas's politicians authority, protesting through election boycotts, disruption of the rail service through the main town, and public demonstrations in Lisbon. On 3 July 2003, the national assembly approved motion to restore the regions status, but President Jorge Sampaio vetoed the decree a month later, provoking general outrage. Geography Within the parish are several localities, small hamlets or villages; these include: Caldas da Felgueira, P√≥voa de Santo Ant√≥nio, Urgeiri√ßa and Vale de Madeiros.

He was head of the scientific headquarters of Auergesellschaft. When the Russians entered Berlin near the end of World War II, he was invited to the Soviet Union, where he stayed for 10 years. For his work on the Soviet atomic bomb project, he was awarded a Stalin Prize, Lenin Prize, and Order of the Red Banner of Labor. When he was repatriated to Germany in 1955, he chose to go to West Germany, where he joined Heinz Maier-Leibnitz on his nuclear reactor staff at Technische Hochschule M√ºnchen (THM); Riehl made contributions to the nuclear facility Forschungsreaktor M√ºnchen (FRM). In 1961 he became an ordinarius professor of technical physics at THM and concentrated his research activities on solid state physics, especially the physics of ice and the optical spectroscopy of solids. Education Riehl was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia in 1901. His mother was Russian-JewishMichael D. Gordin, Red Cloud at Dawn: Truman, Stalin, and the End of the Atomic Monopoly, Farrar, Straus and Giroux (2009), p. 145 and his father was a professional German engineer employed by Siemens and Halske. With this background, Riehl spoke fluent German and Russian. From 1920 to 1927, he was educated at the Saint Petersburg Polytechnical University and Humboldt University of Berlin. He received his doctorate in nuclear chemistry from the University of Berlin in 1927, under the guidance of the nuclear physicist Lise Meitner and the nuclear chemist Otto Hahn; his thesis topic was on Geiger-M√ºller counters for beta ray spectroscopy.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Riehl.Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 4-5 and 68. Career=Early years Riehl initially took a position in German industry with Auergesellschaft, where he became an authority on luminescence. While he completed his Habilitation, he continued his industrial career at Auergesellschaft, as opposed to working in academia. From 1927, he was a staff scientist in the radiology department. From 1937, he was head of the optical engineering department. From 1939 to 1945, he was the director of the scientific headquarters.Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 8. Auergesellschaft had a substantial amount of \\"waste\\" uranium from which it had extracted radium. After reading a paper in 1939 by Siegfried Fl√ºgge, on the technical use of nuclear energy from uranium,Siegfried Fl√ºgge Kann der Energieinhalt der Atomkerne technisch nutzbar gemacht werden?, Die Naturwissenschaften Volume 27, Issues 23/24, 402-410 (June 1939).Also see the article by Siegfried Fl√ºgge Document 74. Siegfried Fl√ºgge: Exploiting Atomic Energy. From the Laboratory Experiment to the Uranium Machine ‚Äì Research Results in Dahlem [August 15, 1939] reprinted in English in Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 197-206. Riehl recognized a business opportunity for the company, and, in July of that year, went to the Heereswaffenamt (HWA, Army Ordnance Office) to discuss the production of uranium. The HWA was interested and Riehl committed corporate resources to the task. The HWA eventually provided an order for the production of uranium oxide, which took place in the Auergesellschaft plant in Oranienburg, north of Berlin.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 369, Appendix F, see the entry for Riehl, and Appendix D, see the entry for Auergesellschaft.Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 13. In the Soviet Union Near the close of World War II, as American, British, and Russian military forces were closing in on Berlin, Riehl and some of his staff moved to a village west of Berlin, to try and assure occupation by British or American forces. However, in mid-May 1945, with the assistance of Riehl's colleague Karl G√ºnter Zimmer, the Russian nuclear physicists Georgy Flerov and Lev Artsimovich showed up one day in NKVD colonel's uniforms.Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 71-72.Oleynikov, 2000, 7. The use of Russian nuclear physicists in the wake of Soviet troop advances to identify and \\"requisition\\" equipment, materiel, intellectual property, and personnel useful to the Russian atomic bomb project is similar to the American Operation Alsos. The military head of Alsos was Lt. Col. Boris Pash, former head of security on the American atomic bomb effort, the Manhattan Project, and its chief scientist was the eminent physicist Samuel Goudsmit. In early 1945, the Soviets initiated an effort similar to Alsos (Russian Alsos). Forty out of less than 100 Russian scientists from the Soviet atomic bomb project's Laboratory 2Laboratory 2 was in Moscow. It was later known as LIPAN and then the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy. See Oleynikov, 2000, 4. went to Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia in support of acquisitions for the project.Oleynikov, 2000, 3-5. The two colonels requested that Riehl join them in Berlin for a few days, where he also met with nuclear physicist Yulii Borisovich Khariton, also in the uniform of an NKVD colonel. This sojourn in Berlin turned into 10 years in the Soviet Union! Riehl and his staff, including their families, were flown to Moscow on 9 July 1945.Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 71-72 and 80.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F, see the entry for Riehl. Eventually, Riehl's entire laboratory was dismantled and transported to the Soviet Union.Walker, 1993, 183. Other prominent German scientists from Berlin who were taken to the Soviet Union at that time, and who would cross paths with Riehl, were Manfred von Ardenne, director of his private laboratory Forschungslaboratoriums f√ºr Elektronenphysik, Gustav Hertz, Nobel Laureate and director of Research Laboratory II at Siemens, Peter Adolf Thiessen, ordinarius professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin and director of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut f√ºr physikalische Chemi und Elektrochemie (KWIPC) in Berlin-Dahlem, and Max Volmer, ordinarius professor and director of the Physical Chemistry Institute at the Berlin Technische Hochschule. Soon after being taken to the Soviet Union, Riehl, von Ardenne, Hertz, and Volmer were summoned for a meeting with Lavrentij Beria, head of the NKVD and the Soviet atomic bomb project.Naimark, 1995, 209-214.Oleynikov, 2000, 10-13. When a Soviet search team arrived at the Auergesellschaft facility in Oranienburg, they found nearly 100 tons of fairly pure uranium oxide. The Soviet Union took this uranium as reparations, which amounted to between 25% and 40% of the uranium taken from Germany and Czechoslovakia at the end of the war. Khariton said the uranium found there saved the Soviet Union a year on its atomic bomb project.Naimark, 1995, 236.Holloway, 1995, 111.Oleynikov, 2000, 9. From 1945 to 1950, Riehl was in charge of uranium production at Plant No. 12 in Elektrostal' (–≠–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª—å\\"–≠–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª—å\\" is sometimes transliterated as \\"Elektrostal\\". A one-to-one transliteration scheme transliterates the Cyrillic letter \\"–≠\\" as \\"Eh\\", which distinguishes it from that for the Cyrillic letter \\"–ï\\" given as \\"E\\". Transliterations often also drop the soft sign \\"—å\\".).Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 89-104. German scientists, who were mostly atomic scientists, sent by the Soviets, at the close of World War II, to work in the Riehl group at Plant No. 12 included A. Baroni (PoW), Hans-Joachim Born, Alexander Catsch (Katsch), Werner Kirst, H. E. Ortmann, Przybilla, Herbert Schmitz (PoW), Sommerfeldt, Herbert Thieme, Tobein, G√ºnter Wirths, and Karl G√ºnter Zimmer. While Born, Catsch, and Zimmer had collaborated with Riehl in Germany, they were actually not part of Auergesellschaft but with N. V. Timofeev-Resovskij's Genetics DepartmentH. J. Born, N. W. Timof√©eff-Ressovsky and K. G. Zimmer Biologische Anwendungen des Z√§hlrohres, Naturwissenschaften Volume 30, Number 40, 600-603 (1942). The authors were identified as being in the Genetics Department of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin-Buch. at the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft's Institut f√ºr Hirnforschung (KWIH, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research) in Berlin-Buch. Riehl had a hard time incorporating these three into his tasking at Plant No. 12 on his uranium production tasking, as Born was a radiochemist, Catsch was a physician and radiation biologist, and Zimmer was a physicist and radiation biologist.Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 2, 31, 71, 83, 121-128, and 202.Maddrell, 2006, 179-180, 186, 189, and 210-221.Albrecht, Heinemann-Gr√ºder, and Wellmann, 1992, Reference #22 on p. 57. The Ehlektrostal' Plant No. 12, by the last quarter of 1946, was delivering about three metric tons of metallic uranium per week to Laboratory No. 2., which was later known as the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy. By 1950, Plant No. 12 was producing about one metric ton per day, and it was not the only metallic uranium production plant in operation.Holloway, 1994, 180 and Reference #56 on p. 410. After the detonation of the Russian uranium bomb, uranium production was going smoothly and Riehl's oversight was no longer necessary at Plant No. 12. Riehl then went, in 1950, to head an institute in Sungul', where he stayed until 1952. Essentially the remaining personnel in his group were assigned elsewhere, with the exception of H. E. Ortmann, A. Baroni (PoW), and Herbert Schmitz (PoW), who went with Riehl. However, Riehl had already sent Born, Catsch, and Zimmer to the institute in December 1947. The German contingent at the institute in Sungul' never exceeded 26 ‚Äì in 1946 there were 95 people at the facility, which grew to 451 by 1955, and the German contingent had already left a few years before that. Besides those already mentioned, other Germans at the institute were Rinatia von Ardenne (sister of Manfred von Ardenne, director of Institute A, in Sukhumi) Wilhelm Menke, Willi Lange (who married the widow of Karl-Heinrich Riewe, who had been at Heinz Pose's Laboratory V, in Obninsk), Joachim Pani, and K. K. Rintelen. The institute in Sungul' was responsible for the handling, treatment, and use of radioactive products generated in reactors, as well as radiation biology, dosimetry, and radiochemistry. The institute was known as Laboratory B, and it was overseen by the 9th Chief Directorate of the NKVD (MVD after 1946), the same organization which oversaw the Russian Alsos operation. The scientific staff of Laboratory B ‚Äì a ShARAShKA ‚Äì was both Soviet and German, the former being mostly political prisoners or exiles, although some of the service staff were criminals.Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 121-128, and 202.Oleynikov, 2000, 15-17.Penzina, V.

Laboratory B was known under another cover nameThe Russians used various types of cover names for facilities to obfuscate both the location and function of a facility; in fact, the same facility could have multiple and changing designations. The nuclear design bureau and assembly plant Arzamas-16, for example, had more than one designation ‚Äì see Yuli Khariton and Yuri Smirnov The Khariton Version, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 20-31 (May 1993).

One of the political prisoners in Laboratory B was Riehls' colleague from the KWIH, N. V. Timofeev- Resovskij, who, as a Soviet citizen, was arrested by the Soviet forces in Berlin at the conclusion of the war, and he was sentenced to 10 years in the Gulag. In 1947, Timofeev-Resovskij was rescued out of a harsh Gulag prison camp, nursed back to health, and sent to Sungul' to complete his sentence, but still make a contribution to the Soviet atomic bomb project. At Laboratory B, Timofeev-Resovskij headed the radiobiology department at Laboratory B, and another political prisoner, S. A. Voznesenskij, headed the radiochemistry department. At Laboratory B, Born, Catsch, and Zimmer were able to conduct work similar to that which they had done in Germany, and all three became section heads in Timofeev-Resovskij's department. Until Riehl's return to Germany in June 1955, which Riehl had to request and negotiate, he was quarantined in Agudseri (Agudzery) starting in 1952. The home in which Riehl lived had been designed by Max Volmer and had been previously occupied by Gustav Hertz, when he was director of Laboratory G.Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 141-142. For his contributions to the Soviet atomic bomb project, Riehl was awarded a Stalin Prize (first class), a Lenin Prize, and the Hero of Socialist Labor medal. As part of the awards, he was also given a Dacha west of Moscow; he did not use the dacha. For work at Plant No. 12, Riehl's colleagues Wirths and Thieme were awarded a Stalin Prize and the Order of the Red Banner of Soviet Labor, also known and the Order of the Red Flag.Oleynikov, 2000, 21-22.Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 103.Maddrell, 2006, 211. Return to Germany In 1954, the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR, German Democratic Republic) and the Soviet Union prepared a list of scientists they wished to keep in the DDR, due to their having worked on projects related to the Soviet atomic bomb project; this list was known as the \\"A-list\\". On this A-list were the names of 18 scientists, dominated by members of the Riehl group, which worked at Plant No. 12 in Ehlektrostal'.The A-list prepared by East Germany and the Soviet Union in 1954 had 18 names on it. These Germans were to be encouraged to stay in East Germany, as they had done work on the Soviet atomic bomb project. At least nine members worked in Riehl's group at Ehlektrostal': *Hans-Joachim Born, Alexander Catsch, Werner Kirst, Przybilla, Nikolaus Riehl, Herbert Thieme, Tobein, G√ºnter Wirths, and Karl Zimmer. *Schmidt may be a tenth Riehl group member Herbert Schmitz, or the name may refer to Fritz Schmidt, another nuclear scientist who was returned to Germany. Others on the list were: *Heinz Barwich, Justus M√ºhlenpfordt, and Karl-Franz Z√ºhlke, who all worked at Institute G headed by Gustav Hertz, *Ingrid Schilling and Alfred Schimohr, who both worked at Institute A headed by Manfred von Ardenne, *Willi Lange, Gerhard Siewert, and Ludwig Ziehl. See Maddrell, 2006, 179-180. Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 137-139.Maddrell, 2006, 179-180. While Riehl's work for the Soviet Union netted him significant prestige and wealth, his primary motivation for leaving Russia was freedom. Riehl arrived in East Germany on 4 April 1955; however, by early June he had fled to West Germany. Once there, he joined Heinz Maier-Leibniz on his nuclear reactor staff at Technische Hochschule M√ºnchen, where he made contributions, starting in 1957, to the nuclear facility Forschungsreaktor M√ºnchen (FRM). In 1961 he became an ordinarius professor of technical physics there and concentrated his research activities on solid state physics, especially the physics of ice and optical spectroscopy of solids.Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 31 and 146-150.History ‚Äì Technische Hochschule M√ºnchen.

The agreement publicly declared the territorial division between Republika Srpska and the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia and called for an end of conflicts between Serbs and Croats. The largest group in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Bosniaks, did not take part in the agreement and were purposefully not invited to the negotiations. In their joint statement the Bosnian Croat and Serb leadership described it as a peace agreement. Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman, in a letter to United States senator Robert Dole, later presented the agreement as part of a Conference on Bosnia and Herzegovina sponsored by the European Community. The parties ultimately parted ways without signing any agreement and clashes between Croat and Serb forces continued. Meeting and aftermath On 6 May 1992, the representatives of the Serbian community of BiH, Radovan Karad≈æiƒá, Momƒçilo Kraji≈°nik and Branko Simiƒá, and the Croatian Community of BiH, represented by Mate Boban and Franjo Boras, met without Bosnian Muslim representatives in the city of Graz in Austria to discuss the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mate Boban and Radovan Karad≈æiƒá issued a joint statement on 6 May 1992, describing it as a peace agreement and called for a general cease-fire in BiH. The territorial demarcation of the two communities in BiH was to be based on the 1939 borders of Banovina of Croatia. It was agreed that \\"in defining the borderline between the two constituent units in the area of Kupres, as well as Bosanska Posavina [...] account should be taken of the compactness of areas and communications.\\" However, an agreement was not reached for the strip of land along the banks of the Neretva, near Mostar, nor the town of Mostar, which is why the parties wanted the European Community to arbitrate their respective claims regarding these regions. The agreement concluded: \\"in view of this agreement, no more reasons obtain for an armed conflict between the Croatians and the Serbs in the entire territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\\" The parties ultimately parted ways on 6 May 1992, without signing any agreement, and clashes between Croat and Serb forces continued.Sabrina P. Ramet, Konrad Clewing, Ren√©o Lukic: Croatia since independence: war, politics, society, foreign relations, p. 132 As of May 1992, military cooperation was achieved between the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) and the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) against Serb forces. Reception According to Vreme‚Äôs military analyst Milo≈° Vasiƒá the Graz agreement was \\"the single most important document of the war\\" and was meant to limit conflict between Serb and Croat forces by allowing both parties to concentrate on taking Bosniak territory from the Bosnian forces. The agreement was seen as Bosnian Croats betraying their Bosniak allies. It was also seen as a sequel to the Karaƒëorƒëevo agreement by the ICTY judgement in the Bla≈°kiƒá case. A Washington Post editorial compared the agreement to the Hitler-Stalin pact that divided Poland. In the ICTY case against Prliƒá et al., Herbert S. Okun was called to testify in April 2007. In this capacity as the deputy of Cyrus Vance, UN special envoy to the Balkans, he had attended a number of meetings where the division of Bosnia Herzegovina was discussed. As Okun described it, the aspirations of Croatia and Serbia for the annexation of parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina became evident after Tuƒëman and Milo≈°eviƒá met in Karaƒëorƒëevo in March 1991 and after the meeting of Mate Boban and Radovan Karad≈æiƒá in May 1992 in Graz. Neither party kept their plans for the creation of separate states within Bosnia-Herzegovina and their annexation to Serbia and Croatia secret at their subsequent meetings with international diplomats.THE HAGUE, 02.04.2007. - BH PARTITION PLANS IN FORM OF A STAIN - Herbert Okun testified that on May 6, 1992, Radovan Karad≈æiƒá and Mate Boban met in Graz in Austria to discuss the partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina along the boundaries of the Croatian Banovina. Herbert Okun also testified that during the international conference on the former Yugoslavia, held between September 1992 and May 1993, Franjo Tuƒëman was the de facto president of the Bosnian Croat delegation, including, among others, Mate Boban and Milivoj Petkoviƒá. During that conference, Herbert Okun heard Franjo Tuƒëman make statements about extending the borders of Croatia, either directly or by including Herceg-Bosna within Croatia. He also heard him make statements about his support for the government of Mate Boban. The May 2013 ICTY judgement in the case discusses the joint statement made in Graz, as well as the subsequent Agreement on Friendship and Cooperation between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia and the peace plans offered before and during the Bosnian War.

Students may elect to specialize in traditional Chinese internal medicine, gynecology, geriatrics, pediatrics, dermatology, neurological disorders, musculo-skeletal disorders or sensory organ disorders. A feature of the AAAOM program is its affiliation with medical schools in China. The Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Jinan, China (AAAOM sister school) has served not only as a model for the formation of AAAOM, but has also hosted two graduates for PhD study in TCM. Exchange programs for advanced study in TCM can also be arranged at other medical universities in China. Faculty AAAOM‚Äôs faculty include eight Chinese scholar‚Äìphysicians from who have made contributions to the field of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Collectively they have published over 450 textbooks, research papers and reference books in China and the United States. Biomedicine classes are taught by Western doctors and chiropractors trained in the United States. Student body The majority of students are women over the age of 30 and over 14% of the student population is of a non-Caucasian ethnicity. Due to the small size of the school, the 110 students enjoy small classes and close relations with faculty and administrative staff.

The Ghost Army was a United States Army tactical deception unit during World War II officially known as the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops. The 1100-man unit was given a unique mission within the Allied Army: to impersonate other Allied Army units to deceive the enemy. From a few months after D-Day, when they landed in France, until the end of the war, they put on a \\"traveling road show\\" utilizing inflatable tanks, sound trucks, fake radio transmissions, scripts and pretence. They staged more than 20 battlefield deceptions, often operating very close to the front lines. Their story was kept secret for more than 40 years after the war, until it was declassified in 1996. The unit was the subject of a PBS documentary The Ghost Army in 2013. History and deployment Inspiration for the unit came from the British units who had honed the deception technique for the battle of El Alamein in late 1942, as Operation Bertram. The unit had its barracks at Camp Forrest, Tennessee, and was fully formed at Camp Pine, New York (now Fort Drum), before sailing for the United Kingdom in early May 1944. In Britain they were based near Stratford upon Avon, and troops participated in Operation Fortitude, the British-designed and led D-Day deceptions of a landing force designated for the Pas-de-Calais. Some troops went to Normandy two weeks after D-Day, where they simulated a Mulberry harbour at night with lights intended to draw German artillery from the real ones. After this the entire unit assisted in tying up the German defenders of Brest by simulating a larger force than was actually encircling them. As the Allied armies moved east, so did the 23rd, and it eventually was based within Luxembourg, from where it engaged in deceptions of crossings of the Ruhr river, positions along the Maginot Line, H√ºrtgen Forest, and finally a major crossing of the Rhine to draw German troops away from the actual sites. Recruiting  Ghost soldiers were encouraged to use their brains and talent to mislead, deceive, and befuddle the German Army. Many were recruited from art schools, advertising agencies and other occupations that encouraged creative thinking. In civilian life, ghost soldiers had been artists, architects, actors, set designers, and engineers. Although the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops consisted of only 1,100 soldiers, the contingent used equipment pioneered by British forces such as dummy tanks and artillery, fake aircraft, and giant speakers broadcasting the sounds of men and artillery to make the Germans think it was upwards of a two-division 30,000-man force. The unit's elaborate ruses helped deflect German units from the locations of larger allied combat units. The unit consisted of the 406th Combat Engineers (which handled security), the 603rd Camouflage Engineers, the 3132 Signal Service Company Special, and the Signal Company Special. Tactics=Visual deception An inflatable dummy tank, modeled after the M4 Sherman The visual deception arm of the Ghost Army was the 603rd Camouflage Engineers. It was equipped with inflatable tanks, cannons, jeeps, trucks, and airplanes that the men would inflate with air compressors, and then camouflage imperfectly so that enemy aerial reconnaissance could see them. They could create dummy airfields, troop bivouacs (complete with fake laundry hanging on clotheslines), motor pools, artillery batteries, and tank formations in a few hours. Many of the men in this unit were artists, recruited from New York and Philadelphia art schools. Their unit became an incubator for young artists who sketched and painted their way through Europe. Several of these soldier-artists went on to have a major impact on art in the postwar US. Bill Blass, Ellsworth Kelly, wildlife artist Arthur Singer, and Art Kane were among the many artists who served in the 603rd. Sonic deception The 3132 Signal Service Company Special handled sonic deception. The unit coalesced under the direction of Colonel Hilton Railey, a colorful figure who, before the war, had \\"discovered\\" Amelia Earhart and sent her on her road to fame. Aided by engineers from Bell Labs, a team from the 3132 went to Fort Knox to record sounds of armored and infantry units onto a series of sound effects records that they brought to Europe. For each deception, sounds could be \\"mixed\\" to match the scenario they wanted the enemy to believe. This program was recorded on state-of-the-art wire recorders (the predecessor to the tape recorder), and then played back with powerful amplifiers and speakers mounted on halftracks. These sounds were audible away. Radio deception \\"Spoof radio\\", as it was called, was handled by the Signal Company. Special Operators created phony traffic nets, impersonating the radio operators from real units. Different Morse Code operators each have their own individual style of sending; the Signal Company operators mimicked a departed operator's style so that the enemy would not detect that the real unit and its radio operator were long gone. Atmosphere To complement existing techniques, the unit often employed theatrical effects to supplement the other deceptions. Collectively called \\"atmosphere\\", these included simulating actual units deployed elsewhere by the application of their divisional insignia, painting appropriate unit insignia on vehicles and having the individual companies deployed as if they were regimental headquarters units. The same few covered trucks/lorries, with just two troops in the visible seats near the rear to appear to be full of motorized infantry, would be driven in a loop to look like long convoys. \\"MPs\\" (military police) would be deployed at cross roads wearing appropriate divisional insignia and some personnel would dress as divisional generals and staff officers visiting towns where enemy agents or scouts were likely to see them. A few actual tanks and artillery pieces were occasionally assigned to the unit to make the \\"dummies\\" in the distance appear more realistic.

It is one of the worldwide assembly of such regional breeding programs for threatened species in zoos. The North America counterpart is the Species Survival Plan (SSP), while Australian, Japanese and Indian zoos also have similar programs. Combined, there are now many hundred zoos worldwide involved in the regional breeding programs. Each EEP has a coordinator who is assisted by a species committee. The coordinator collects information on the status of all the animals kept in EAZA zoos and aquariums of the species for which he or she is responsible, produces a studbook, carries out demographic and genetic analyses, produces a plan for the future management of the species and provides recommendations to participating institutions. Together with the Species Committee, recommendations are made each year about relocating and breeding animals, and the conditions of such a move (breeding loan, exchange, term free disposition, etc.). EAZA is an organization for the European zoo and aquarium community that links over 340 membership organizations in 41 countries. The mission of EAZA is to promote cooperation for furthering regional collection planning and wildlife conservation, mainly through coordinated breeding programs of wild animals such as EEP and European Studbook (ESB), which is less intensive than the EEP. Even though EEP participation is mainly reserved for EAZA collections, it is possible for non-EAZA collections to be included in these programmes. There are generally however more restrictions on such zoos (which may go as far as only holding non-breeding animals for educational purposes), and on the number of programmes they may participate in. Important (sub)species Gorillas are stocky animals with broad chests and shoulders, large, human-like hands and small eyes set into hairless faces.  Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae)  One species which has been handled by EEP was Sumatran tiger which have only a few hundred left in the wild, and only about 7% of their habitat remains. They used to live in all the Sumatran territory, but nowadays most of them can only be found in the mountain regions of the Burit Barisan volcanic area. This species is currently threatened with the destruction of habitat and poaching, for trade of its parts in traditional oriental medicine or as a trophy. The Tiger EEP has made contributions to the conservation of Amur and Sumatran tigers in the wild, via fundraising for wild tiger conservation projects, raising awareness and providing educational opportunities, and assisting with relevant research and training. For example, in November 2011, Sumatran tiger Kirana has delivered 3 cubs at Chester Zoo under EEP which attempts to coordinate breeding between zoos and maintain genetic diversity.  Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla)  The Gorilla EEP is one of the most intensively managed and oldest breeding programmes in European zoos. The Gorilla EEP was started in 1987 and was run by the Frankfurt Zoological Garden, who continue to maintain the Gorilla Studbook. In the past decade, some major improvements have been achieved in the management of the EEP for the western lowland gorilla Gorilla gorilla gorilla. Neonatal mortality and hand‚Äêrearing rates have decreased; transfers in most cases proved to be successful: almost all gorillas were integrated into their new groups and most animals introduced to a breeding group had their first offspring within 2 years. The results show that the current management approach is successful, and that the population is sustainable and has good genetic health.  Necessity of international cooperation in breeding programmes  For zoo visitors to have the opportunity to see how wild animals look, live, and behave, zoos must ensure that truly wild animals, with all of their natural characteristics, are presented. Zoo animals are vulnerable to three very serious breeding problems inherent to small, artificial populations: inbreeding depression, loss of genetic variability, and accumulation of deleterious mutations. These problems can easily result in loss of original wild traits, and in the expression of heritable abnormalities. If what was once a pure, wild population of animals deteriorates through generations of uncontrolled breeding into inferior or partially domesticated stock, then the animals are no longer suitable for any conservation effort, and the zoos have failed to perform an important educational task. The effects of breeding captive populations of wild animals over periods of many generations have been well studied. Based on these studies and genetic theory, guidelines for breeding such small populations have been developed. Following such guidelines should sharply reduce possibilities of breeding problems and concurrently should maximize the number of generations in which the original founding diversity can be maintained. Guidelines for captive populations follow some basic principles including beginning with as many \\"founders\\" as possible (preferably at least 20-30 of animals), increase the number of individuals within the population rapidly, all individuals from the founder population should have \\"equal genetic representation\\" and inbreeding should be avoided. The application of these guidelines, and many others tailored to specific populations, results in strictly controlled breeding programmes in which nothing is left to chance. Only in this manner can healthy and truly wild populations be maintained over a period of one or two hundred years. Such strict control is entirely dependent on cooperation among zoos that hold individuals of the species, as single zoos generally do not have the facilities to maintain a population of adequate size independently.  Challenges  The largest problem encountered in the functioning of the EEP is undoubtedly the actual execution of breeding management recommendations: it is often difficult to develop policies applicable to an entire group of zoos (varying from 10 to well over 50 depending on the species programme) when these are spread throughout several countries with different languages and laws, and with dissimilar political and economic backgrounds. Just the incongruencies in laws can sometimes make exchange of specimens for breeding purposes by two closely situated zoos a formidable task if a border happens to lie between them. Yet successes have been achieved: the growth of the EEP has been considerable since its initiation in 1985. Now more than 200 zoos from 25 European countries are involved in breeding programmes, while the EEP is strongly supported by the various national zoo federations and by the European Community Association of Zoos and Aquaria (ECAZA). Currently, preparations are being made to find a pan-European zoo association that, among other tasks, will be responsible for EEP affairs.

Opened by the Somerset Central Railway in 1856 as Ashcott and Meare, the name changed to Ashcott in 1876. Consisting of a short wooden platform and station building, the station was next to a road level crossing. This was operated with a 10 lever ground frame. History The station was opened by the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, a joint line run by a committee for the Midland Railway and the Southern Railway. The line became a joint operation of the Southern Railway and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway after the grouping of 1923. It was placed in the Western Region when the railways were nationalised in 1948. The station closed when trains were withdrawn during the Beeching Axe, taking effect on 7 March 1966. Eclipse Peat Company west of Ashcott existed Alexander Siding, which allowed exchange between the SD&JR; and the Eclipse Peat Works industrial tramway system, and hence distribution of cut peat products across the United Kingdom. The Eclipse also had a level crossing on the SD&JR; branch further towards Glastonbury. On 19 August 1949, a British Railways passenger train from Highbridge collided with an Eclipse narrow gauge diesel locomotive crossing on the level and left the track, ending up in the Glastonbury Canal.

Like all other security methods, layered security is designed to protect assets (an asset is anything you want to protect and can include people, property, data, etc). Layered security can be used in any environment, from military operations, to individuals, and community residents (homeowners, neighborhood watch groups, etc). In other words, \\"layered security is the practice of using many different security controls at different levels to protect assets. This provides strength and depth to reduce the effects of a threat. Your goal is to create redundancies (backups) in case security measures fail, are bypassed, or defeated. Placing assets in the innermost perimeter will provide layers of security measures at increasing distances from the protected asset. The number of layers and the security measures you use, will depend on the threat and importance of the asset\\". 420x420px The term bears some similarity to defense in depth, a term adopted from a military strategy that involves multiple layers of defense that resist rapid penetration by an attacker but yield rather than exhaust themselves by too- rigid tactics. As the incursion progresses, resources are consumed and progress is slowed until it is halted and turned back. The information assurance use of the term \\"defense in depth\\" assumes more than merely technical security tools deployment; it also implies policy and operations planning, user training, physical access security measures, and direct information assurance personnel involvement in dealing with attempts to gain unauthorized access to information resources. Within a defense in depth security strategy, layered security is regarded by some as merely a delaying tactic used to buy time to bring security resources to bear to deal with a malicious security cracker's activities.  Philosophy  Layered security is an example of the Swiss Cheese model (or \\"cumulative act effect\\"), used in risk analysis and risk management. In this model, security systems are likened to multiple slices of swiss cheese, stacked side by side, in which the risk of a threat becoming a reality is mitigated by the fact that it must pass through \\"holes\\" in the defenses (i.e. not be trapped and detected by each different defense), and these defenses are of different kinds, and locations that are \\"layered\\" behind each other. Therefore, in theory, lapses and weaknesses in one defense do not easily allow a risk to materialize, since other defenses also exist, to prevent a single point of weakness.  Commercial  For every category of threat, there should be an effective control deployed to mitigate the threat. Security vendors will sometimes cite differing solutions, but most can be grouped under consumer or enterprise categories: = Consumer Layered Security Strategy = * Extended validation (EV) SSL certificates * Multifactor authentication (also sometimes known as versatile or two-factor authentication) * Single sign-on (SSO) * Fraud detection and risk-based authentication * Transaction signing and encryption * Secure Web and e-mail * Open fraud intelligence network = Enterprise Layered Security Strategy = * Workstation application whitelisting * Workstation system restore solution * Workstation and network authentication * File, disk and removable media encryption * Remote access authentication * Network folder encryption * Secure boundary and end-to-end messaging * Content control and policy-based encryption = Integrated Solutions = An \\"ad hoc\\" security strategy, with numerous vendors and an abundance of different, sometimes incompatible security solutions and products can leave gaps in protection, whereas a vertically integrated vendor stack could provide more comprehensive defense. Single-vendor solutions improve interoperability between components of a complete security strategy, and may offer performance and price benefits over a multi-vendor approach. = Best Of Breed Solutions = The contrasting commercial security product argument is that a \\"best of breed\\" approach provides more effective protection. While a single vendor's vertically integrated product stack may be the offering of choice for vendors who want to monopolize a client's or customer's business, it could also be argued that each component of a comprehensive security strategy should be evaluated both for its performance within its niche and its open compatibility with other, non-integrated components of the whole.

The collection The Grohmann Museum Collection contains over 1400 European and American paintings, sculptures and works on paper that depict various forms of work. Captured on canvas and paper or cast in bronze, the works reflect a variety of artistic styles and subjects that document the evolution of organized work, from manpower and horsepower to water, steam and electric power. The collection spans over 400 years of history (17-21st centuries). Earlier paintings depict men and women working on the farm or at home. Later images show tradespeople engaged in their work, such as blacksmiths, chemists, cobblers, cork makers, glass blowers, or taxidermists. The most recent works are images of machines and men embodying the paradoxes of industrialism of the mid-18th century to post-World War II. These works, often commissioned by the factory's owner, are exterior views of steel mills and foundries surrounded by trains and tracks or dark factory interiors where glowing molten metal is juxtaposed with factory workers and managers.

Intonaco is an Italian term for the final, very thin layer of plaster on which a fresco is painted. The plaster is painted while still wet, in order to allow the pigment to penetrate into the intonaco itself. An earlier layer, called arriccio, is laid slightly coarsely to provide a key for the intonaco, and must be allowed to dry, usually for some days, before the final very thin layer is applied and painted on.Ugo Procacci, in Frescoes from Florence,pp. 15-25 1969, Arts Council, London, gives a full account of the process. In Italian the term intonaco is also used much more generally for normal plaster or mortar wall- coatings in buildings. Intonaco is traditionally a mixture of sand (with granular dimensions less than two millimeters) and a binding substance. Types of intonaco Different types of intonaco are classified based on the binding material used: * Intonaco based on lime, where the only binding substance is hydrated lime * Intonaco lime/cement, where the binding element is a mixture of hydrated lime with Portland cement, with a majority of lime * Intonaco cement/lime, where the binding element is a mixture of hydrated lime, and Portland cement, with a majority of Portland cement * Intonaco with a plaster base, where the binding element is exclusively plaster The sand utilized in the intonaco can be limestone or silicate, taken from a natural source such as a river or from sand that is pulverized. Types of stabilizers Intonaco can be stabilized using: * Lime * plaster * Calcium- sulfate based plaster * Terracotta-based cement References Category:Painting techniques Category:Plastering ","title":"Intonaco"},{"id":"13432490","text":"A revenue stream is a source of revenue of a company or organization. In business, a revenue stream is generally made up of either recurring revenue, transaction-based revenue, project revenue, or service revenue. In government, the term revenue stream often refers to different types of taxes.  Recurring revenue  Recurring revenue is revenue that is likely to continue to be generated regularly for a significant period of time. It is typically used by companies that sell subscriptions or services. It could take the form of bills paid monthly by consumers, or commercial contracts lasting several years. An example of this is monthly phone contracts. Unless the contract is broken or the customer does not pay, the phone business is guaranteed monthly revenue for the duration of the contract, often 2 years. Recurring revenue is often tracked on either a monthly basis, as monthly recurring revenue (MRR), or an annual basis, as annual recurring revenue (ARR). This number excludes all one- time, non-recurring payments; for instance, implementation or professional service fees, hardware, and discounts.  Transaction based revenue  These revenues based on predictable sales of goods. Revenue is earned by a transaction from a customer. A customer in a clothing store, buying a new jacket, generates a transaction based revenue. This type of revenue is often considered less attractive than the recurring model because an action is required to attract customers.  Project revenue  These are revenues generated through one time projects. Companies that rely entirely or largely need to invest a lot of effort into maintaining customer relationships. In this type of model, revenue is hard to predict, because it is hard to know what lies further down the road.  Service revenue  This revenue model sells the time of oneself or of a company's employees. The service revenue model is often used in combination with one of the other models. An example of service based model are consulting firms. The offer their advice and commonly charge per hour.  Revenue generation  The Business Model Canvas lists 7 ways of generating revenue: asset sales, usage fees, subscription fees, lending/leasing/renting, licensing, brokerage fees, and advertising.  Asset sale  An asset sale is completed, when the buyer acquires the assets dropped by a company. An example of an asset sale is when a shoe store sells a pair of shoes to a customer. By doing this, the shoe shop sells the ownership rights to the buyer, giving him complete freedom over what to do with the pair of shoes. This type of revenue belongs to the transaction based revenue.  Subscription fees  A company sells the repeated access to a product or a service. Mobile phone companies for example, generally sell their phone service through a monthly subscription plan. This model was pioneered by magazines and newspapers. This model is desirable because often a contract binds the customer to pay for the offered product or service. This means, a company can make a much more precise revenue forecast. This revenue stream belongs to the recurring revenue model.  Lending / leasing / renting  This sort of revenue is made by giving someone access to an asset, which can be a product or a service. The key difference to a subscription fee is that this asset still belongs to the company. Common examples include car rentals or hardware leasing. This revenue stream also belongs to the recurring revenue model. The above-mentioned are only some of the most popular revenue streams. With the growth of the internet, companies are beginning to look for new internet based revenue streams.  Examples = Consumer goods  Food service  An example of how businesses are managing to create new revenue streams without substantial capital investment, can be found in gastronomy. Restaurant managers and planners are beginning to offer multiple lines of service as opposed to opening new restaurants. One of these services is catering. Offering a catering service does not require the huge amount of investment, whereas opening a new restaurant does. Also catering attracts an entirely new customer base. This allows restaurants to increase the number of revenue streams without needing large investments.
