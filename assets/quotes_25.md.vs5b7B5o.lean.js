It also assists law enforcement units in anti-crime operations. It traces its origin to the Soviet-era Alpha Group, created on July 28, 1974. As of 2014, Colonel Sergei Zubkov is designated the commander of the unit. History The Soviet KGB has designed the creation of Alpha Group on July 28, 1974 when Yuri Andropov was head of the KGB after the 1972 Munich massacre. It's suggested that the order was done to respond West Germany's creation of the Grenzschutzgruppe 9 (or the GSG 9). The unit was created on March 3, 1990, stationed at the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic and tasked to tackle anti-terrorist assignments throughout the BSSR and the Baltic States under orders from Vladimir Kryuchkov as the 11th Group of the KGB. The unit was initially staffed by 45 operators. In 1992, the unit officially received its official name and was placed under the command of the SSCRB. Post-USSR breakup Belarusian AG operators conduct a breaching exercise in 2008. In 1994, AG was involved in a hostage rescue operation when an armed criminal took a student named Milana Martinkevich hostage. She was rescued and the criminal was detained. On August 1, 1996, the AG was involved in arresting five men, including an active Belarusian soldier, for attempting to smuggle nuclear material in Borisov for $50,000. In June 2006, the KGB has reaffirmed Alpha Group's mandate to combat terrorism. AG operators were involved in anti-terrorist exercises throughout the year alongside Belarusian military and law enforcement forces. In the 2010s, Colonel Oleg Chernyshev was placed under various financial and travel- based sanctions for the KGB's human rights violation activities in Belarus. On June 10, 2014, a Georgian national was involved in hijacking a Belavia airline in the Minsk-Kutaisi flight route. AG negotiators were involved in getting him to surrender himself before he was eventually arrested. On October 31, 2014, AG operators participated in an exercise with the Belarusian Ministry of Emergency Situations. On November 29, 2014, AG participated in anti-terrorist exercises due to the World Ice Hockey Championship Games being held at Minsk alongside the Belarusian Special Rapid Response Unit (SOBR). On June 20, 2017, AG operators participated in an anti-terrorist operation exercise at Minsk National Airport in recapturing a hijacked Boeing 737. Alpha Group celebrated its 30th anniversary on March 3, 2020. On July 29, 2020, AG operators alongside Minsk police arrested 32 persons from the Wagner Group after they arrived in Minsk from July 24 to July 25 under allegations of planning to participate in destabilization activities before the upcoming 2020 presidential elections. Requirements According to Colonel Oleg Chernyshev, 80% of its potential recruits are experienced personnel from other Belarusian law enforcement agencies while others are trained athletes. The operator's average age, after being recruited, is usually at 27 years. A recruit is placed through interviews and lie detector tests in order to remove anyone who's motivated to join AG for financial or vanity reasons. Equipment AG is known to have access to armored vehicles, including the Bogdan Bars armored car. They also use armored vehicles outfitted with the MARS assault ladder system when conducting raids on hijacked airplanes.

It reports directly to the Minister of the Interior, and is based in Shchelkovo-7 near Moscow. Zubr was made up of officers drawn from the OMON riot police near Moscow and numbered about 430 people. Zubr is equipped with armored personnel carriers, GAZ Tigers IMVs and other special equipment, and includes snipers and dog handlers. The main tasks facing the Zubr riot police are to ensure the safety of citizens, the rule of law and public safety on the streets and in other public places , as well as during mass events; prevention and suppression of crimes, participation in the fight against terrorist, sabotage and reconnaissance and landing groups.

Biography Franks trained at the Staatliche Bauhochschule (de) in Weimar, Germany from 1929-1930. He also attended classes at the Bauhaus art school in Dessau, although he was not officially enrolled at the school. On his return to England Franks worked with a mining community in the Village of Boosbeck in the northeast of England, teaching a group of unemployed miners how to design and make furniture. It was through his involvement with Boosbeck that Franks got to know the composer Michael Tippett. Franks and Michael Tippett were involved in an intense love affair during the 1930s, and Tippett dedicated his String Quartet no.1 to Franks. Franks was an important influence on Tippett both personally and creatively, their shared love of poetry, politics and traditional folk music influenced Tippett's music at this time. Wilf Franks was an anti-fascist, Marxist political activist who supported Trotskyism and the Fourth International. While living in Germany, Franks was part of an anti- fascist counter demonstration which failed to stop a Nazi parade in the city of Dessau. On Sunday 4 October 1936, Franks was arrested (and later sentenced to 28 days hard labour) while helping to block a march by the British Union of Fascists (BUF), during the The Battle of Cable Street. In 1936 Franks studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, and later performed on numerous early BBC Television shows, including The Insect Play (1939) and The Pilgrims Progress (1939). Due to his political beliefs, Franks refused conscription to the British Army and he was imprisoned as a conscientious objector during World War Two. In the post war years, Franks became a designer at the Ford Motor Company at Dagenham and later a lecturer in design at Leeds Polytechnic. Wilf Franks' design work with the mining community of Boosbeck provided inspiration to the artist Adam Clarke, a graduate of the Royal College of Art. In 2015, Clarke established New Boosbeck Industries, replicating the furniture making project that Wilf Franks had initiated in the 1930s.

The line operates every 32 minutes during weekdays and Saturdays, and 40 minutes on Sunday at a combined frequency of 6-10 minutes during the weekday peak-hours, 16 minutes during the weekday midday and Saturday, and 20 minutes on Sunday. Trips roughly take 48 minutes to complete. Background Routes H2, H3, and H4 operate as part of the Crosstown Line between Brookland‚ÄìCUA station and Tenleytown‚ÄìAU station. Routes H2 and H4 operate daily while route H3 operates during the weekday peak-hours. Routes H2 and H4 serve the hospital complex along 1st Street, while route H3 skips the complex following a similar pathway to the H4. The line splits after serving Columbia Heights station. Route H2 mainly operates along Adams Mill Road, Connecticut Avenue, Van Ness Street, and Veazey Street while routes H3 and H4 mainly operate along Mount Pleasant Street, Park Road, Porter Street, and Wisconsin Avenue. Both routes connect Brookland and Tenleytown stations by bus without having to take the Red Line. Routes H2, H3, and H4 currently operate out of Bladensburg division. History Route H3 in Tenleytown Routes H2 and H4 originally operated under streetcars by the Capital Traction Company. The line was then made into buses in the 1920s. Routes H2 and H4 operated between Fort Lincoln and Westmoreland Circle connecting Tenleytown, Forest Hills, Cleveland Park, Mount Pleasant, Columbia Heights, Rock Creek Park, Brookland along Yuma Street, Massachusetts Avenue, Wisconsin Avenue, Porter Street NW (H4), Van Ness/Veazey Street NW (H2), Connecticut Avenue (H2), Columbia Road NW, Irving Street NW, Michigan Avenue NW/NE, Franklin Street NE, and 14th Street NE. It mostly provides service in outer DC without having to enter Downtown. The line was later acquired by DC Transit in 1956 and later diverted to serve the Washington Hospital Complexes along 1st Street. It later became a Metrobus route in 1973. 1978 Changes On February 19, 1978 after Brookland‚ÄìCUA station opened, routes H2 and H4 were diverted off Monroe Street to serve the new station. This gives residents access to the Red Line on its route. No route changes were made during its route. 1984 Changes On August 25, 1984, routes H2 and H4 were rerouted off Tenley Circle to serve Tenleytown‚ÄìAU station in the middle of its route when it opened. No route changes were made on the route. 1999 Changes Route H2 at Tenleytown‚ÄìAU station On September 18, 1999 after Columbia Heights station opened a series of changes were made to the H2 and H4. Routes H2 was shorten to terminate at Van Ness‚ÄìUDC station and route H4 was shorten to terminate at Tenleytown‚ÄìAU station. Service to Westmoreland Circle and along Yuma Street was replaced by a new route N8 which will operate between Van Ness and Wesley Heights. This was due to resident complaint along Yuma Street and Tenleytown over H2 and H4 buses making loud noises along Yuma street causing noise pollution and damage to homes. The new N8 solves the noise complaint problem by using smaller and quieter 30 ft buses. Routes H2 and H4 were also shorten from Fort Lincoln to Brookland‚ÄìCUA station with the portion between the two points was replaced by a new route H6 which operates on the former route H2 and H4 routing. A new route H3 was introduced to operate alongside route H4 during the weekday peak- hours between Brookland and Tenleytown stations following route H2's routing in Mount Pleasant and route H4 routing along Porter Street and Wisconsin Avenue plus operating along Reno Road. The main difference is route H3 would not serve the Hospital Complexes along 1st street and instead remain along Michigan Avenue. 2000 Changes On June 25, 2000, route H3 was rerouted along the H4 routing on Mount Pleasant Street, Park and Klingle roads instead of operating along Adams Mill Road, Irving Street, and Harvard Street where the H2 operates. 2010 Proposed Changes In 2010 during WMATA's FY2011 budget year, WMATA proposed to reroute route H2 back to Tenleytown‚ÄìAU station discontinuing service to Van Ness‚ÄìUDC station in order to replace route N8 which is proposed to be eliminated due to declining ridership. Route H2 would operate along Van Ness Street, Reno Road, Veazey Street, and Wisconsin Avenue. Route H3 would also be rerouted between the intersections of Porter Street & Reno Road NW and Wisconsin Avenue & Veazey Street NW via Porter Street and Wisconsin Avenue which follows the current H4 route. Alternative service along Connecticut Avenue to Van Ness will be available on routes L1, L2, and L4. 2010 Changes On December 19, 2010, route H2 was rerouted to turn on Van Ness Street, Reno Street, Veazey Street, and Wisconsin Avenue to serve Tenleytown‚ÄìAU station in order to replace the N8 routing along those streets which was shortened to Tenleytown station. Route H3 service was also rerouted to remain on Porter Street and turn onto Wisconsin Avenue and follow the H4 routing to Tenleytown station. Service along Reno Street where the H3 operated plus service to Van Ness‚ÄìUDC station was discontinued. Routes L1, L2, and L4 took over the discontinued portion of the H2 along Connecticut Avenue but there was no alternative service is provided on Reno Street. As of 2020, there has been no major changes to routes H2, H3, or H4. 2013 Proposed Changes In September 2013, during WMATA's FY2014 budget year, WMATA proposed to convert route H3 into a MetroExtra limited-stop route and extend the route to Rhode Island Avenue‚ÄìBrentwood station via 12th street and Rhode Island Avenue. This was to provide a more direct connection between Rhode Island Ave station, the hospital center complex, and Columbia Heights and provide a faster ride across town by limiting the number of stops. The current H3 routing between Brookland and Tenleytown, weekday service frequency and span of service will remain unaffected. Route H3 will serve the following stops: * Rhode Island Avenue‚ÄìBrentwood station * Brookland‚ÄìCUA station * Michigan Avenue & 1st Street NW * Georgia Avenue * 11th Street * 14th Street * 16th Street * Park Road & Mount Pleasant Street * Porter Street & Connecticut Avenue * Porter Street & Wisconsin Avenue * Tenleytown‚ÄìAU station Existing local stops will still be provided by routes H2 and H4. Incidents * On July 21, 2014, an H4 driver and a 65-year-old male passenger got into an altercation near Tenleytown station after the passenger refused to pay the fare. The man punched the driver in the face while holding a blade in his fist. The driver was sent to the hospital after sustained a laceration to his face. The man was detained by the Metropolitan Police Department and later arrested by Metro Transit Police. The man was charged with assault with a deadly weapon. * On January 22, 2020, an XN40 on the H4 slammed into half a dozen vehicles along Porter Street & Connecticut Avenue in Cleveland Park.

Early life  Capponi was born in Montreal, Quebec, the youngest sister of writer and activist Pat Capponi. Both sisters described an abusive home, which they left as young women. In 1984, she graduated from a police training program at Centennial College in Toronto. \\"Going to college was the most significant thing I could have done to change my life,\\" she said later.  Career  Diana Capponi dropped out of school, traveled to India, and became addicted to heroin. Back in Canada, she moved to Toronto, where two of her sisters lived. Her sister Pat helped her find housing in Parkdale and rehabilitation. She worked at a women's shelter, and then at a cleaning service. She founded the Ontario Council of Alternative Businesses (OCAB), to create economic opportunities for psychiatric survivors. She served on the board of directors at the Gerstein Centre in Toronto. In 2003, Capponi became coordinator of the new Employment Works program at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). In this position she continued her earlier work, building businesses and careers with survivors of addiction and mental illness. She consulted on similar projects and on mental health policy across Canada, and internationally. \\"Current research indicates that there is absolutely no correlation between a person's mental health diagnosis and their ability to work. If you can do the job, then you can do the job, period,\\" she explained. Capponi appeared in a National Film Board of Canada documentary, Working Like Crazy (1999), and in a television program, Second Chance: Making It Work (2005). In 2009, she testified about employment and mental health before a committee of the Canadian Parliament.  Personal life  Capponi identified herself as a psychiatric survivor. She married Brenda Needham in 2003; they stopped living together in 2009, but remained close. Capponi died in 2014, from metastatic breast cancer, aged 61 years, in Toronto.

This genre is mood based and the basic theme revolves around the separation of lover and his beloved. \\"Biraha\\" in Hindi means separation. Its place in folk songs is as important as that of Dwipadi in Sanskrit, Gatha in Prakrit and Barwai in Hindi. It is composed of two episodes. When one side says their point, the other side answers in the same verse. There is no limit to the number of quantities. The volume varies with the tune of the song. It indicates the intense longing of the spouse and the pain of love or feeling of separation from him. Separation is a king, a body that does not know separation, it is a living corpse. Outside India, this mode is gaining popularity by increasing its penetration in Mauritius, Madagascar and the surrounding Bhojpuri-speaking region. Origin The sources of the origin of this folk music are found in the early nineteenth century. During the British rule, the trend of migrating from rural areas to the metros had increased. Such workers had to stay away from their families for long periods of time for their livelihood. The lament of separation from both the motherland and spouse led to the birth of Biraha. The genre is extremely popular among the farmers and laborers in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. After hard labor throughout the day, these people used to sing songs of the same folklore in high voices in small groups at night. About 55 years ago, in the commercial areas of Thatheri Bazar, Chaukhambha, Varanasi, workers were seen singing biraha. There is no meaningful evidence for the naming of Biraha. If we understand the meaning of Biraha based on Hindi dictionary, it will be as follows - The word Biraha in Bhojpuri is a spoiled (apabhramsa) form of the word Virah in Hindi, which means - grief. Biraha may have been named Biraha by Aadi Kavi Bihari Yadav or Bihari's disciples because Biraha consists of a story that is based on a Karuna Rasa incident (Kand). But not all birha have compassion (Karuna). The essence of a Biraha is sometimes heroic (Veer Rasa) and of humor (Hasya Rasa). The inclusion of many essence in Biraha proves the name Biraha to be misleading and flawed. Popular forms Initially Biraha was popular only as a labor-free folk genre. Today there are two types of birha singing. The first type is called Khadi Birha. In this type of singing, there is no consistency of instruments, but the rhythm of the singer is absolutely fixed. First the lead singer starts the song head in the vocals of Tara Saptak and then the choir joins it. The second form of Biraha singing is staged. Notable Biraha singers * Adiguru Bihari Yadav (who is considered the father of Biraha, born - Ghazipur 1837-1937) * Baleshwar Yadav * Heera Lal Yadav * Vijay Lal Yadav, Ghazipur * Dinesh Lal Yadav, Ghazipur * Haidar Ali Juganu References Category:Folk songs Category:Folk music ","title":"Biraha"},{"id":"64339379","text":"August Str√∂mberg (born 28 February 1992) is a Swedish football goalkeeper who plays for Varbergs BoIS.

She showed very good form as a juvenile in 2019, winning two of her three races including the Debutante Stakes. On her first run of 2020 she won the Coronation Stakes. Background Alpine Star is a chestnut filly with no white markings bred in Ireland by the Niarchos family. She was sent into training with Jessica Harrington at Moone, in County Kildare. She was from the second crop of foals sired by the 2014 German Horse of the Year Sea The Moon, who won four of his five races before his racing career was ended by injury. Alpine Star's dam Alpha Lupi was unraced but came from a very successful female bloodline which has been in the ownership of the Niarchos family for several generations: she was a daughter of East of the Moon who was in turn a daughter of Miesque. In 2015 she had produced Alpha Centauri. Racing career=2019: two-year-old season Alpine Star was ridden in all of her races as a two-year-old by Shane Foley. On her track debut she started at odds of 7/2 for a maiden race over seven furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse on 11 July and finished third of the seven runners behind Love and Soul Search under a gentle ride from Foley. On 2 August the filly started 7/4 favourite for a similar event over the same distance at Galway and won \\"comfortably\\" by three and a quarter lengths from the Aidan O'Brien-trained Santiago after taking the lead a furlong from the finish. Three weeks after her win at Galway Alpine Star was stepped up in class to contest the Group 2 Debutante Stakes at the Curragh and started the 2/1 second choice in the betting behind Love in a nine-runner field which also included Soul Search. After tracking the leaders, Alpine Star made steady progress in the last quarter mile and overhauled Love in the final strides to win by a short head. After the race Harrington said \\"She‚Äôs tough, isn‚Äôt she. She‚Äôs all heart and stays really well. Shane said they went hard the whole way and she got a little bit lost in the middle of the race, but when she got upsides all she wanted to do was stick her head out. She's tough and needs a mile.\\" The filly was expected to end her season with a trip to France for the Group 1 Prix Marcel Boussac at Longchamp Racecourse in October but was pulled out of the race after sustaining a muscle injury. In the official rating of Irish two-year-olds for 2019 Alpine Star was rated the fifth-best juvenile filly of the year behind Millisle, Albigna, Love and Cayenne Pepper. 2020: three-year-old season The flat racing season in England and Ireland was disrupted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Alpine Star did not make her reappearance until 20 June when she was sent to England to contest the Coronation Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot. Ridden by Frankie Dettori she started the 9/2 third favourite behind Quadrilateral and the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf winner Sharing in a seven-runner field which also included Run Wild (Pretty Polly Stakes), Cloak of Spirits (second in the 1000 Guineas), So Wonderful (third in the Irish 1,000 Guineas) and Love Locket (Leopardstown Fillies Trial Stakes). After settling behind the leading group as Run Wild set the pace, Alpine Star took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew away in the closing stages to win \\"comfortably\\" by four and a half lengths from Sharing. Jessica Harrington commented \\"I'm very lucky to have fillies like that. I couldn't believe how good she was. I actually have no idea what the plan will be. I need to talk to the owners and Frankie, and then we'll make the decision\\" while Dettori, who was winning the race for the first time said \\"I've never been able to be on the right horse in this race. Alpine Star was beautifully prepared by Jessica and I'm thrilled... She'd definitely get a mile and a quarter, she did her best work at the end but I don't know about a mile and a half... she's a good filly and won in good style\\". On 5 July Alpine Star was sent to France to contest the Prix de Diane over 2000 metres at Chantilly Racecourse in which she was ridden by St√©phane Pasquier and went off the 2.1/1 favourite in an eleven-runner field. She led for most of the way before being overtaken by Fancy Blue 200 metres from the finish and despite rallying strongly in the closing stages she was beaten a short neck into second place.

He is recognized as the father of the and the leader of the of 1908. He was also vocally opposed to the metastasizing French colonial presence in Morocco, and launched at-TƒÅ'≈´n ( The Plague), the first national newspaper in Morocco. He was a member of the al-Kattani family and the Tariqa Kattania (ÿßŸÑÿ∑ÿ±ŸäŸÇÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ™ÿßŸÜŸäÿ©), a Sufi order. He composed over 300 works, printed 27 of them, and wrote Sufi philosophical love poetry. He was accused of treason and flogged to death under Sultan Abdelhafid.  Biography  He was born in 1873 to the illustrious al-Kattani literary family claiming Idrisid ancestry and known for its independent stance in relation to the Makhzen. His father was the polymath Abdul-Kabir al-Kattani, who was called the \\"Mountain of Sunna,\\" and his grandfather was the Sheikh Abu al-Mafakhir al-Kattani. His mother was Fadila Bint Idris al-Kattaniya, a scholar of fiqh. His uncle was Mu·∏•ammad ibn Ja øfar al-KattƒÅnƒ´. In 1853, the family established the Kattania Sufi order, which attracted men of different socio-economic backgrounds, but especially the working poor. Muhammad al-Kattani enrolled in a kuttab to learn the Quran, memorizing it while in his youth. He attended al-Qarawiyyin University and a few other schools in Fes, benefiting from the tutelage of some of the greatest scholars of his time. His father introduced him to Sufism, reading Ibn Arabi's book The Meccan Revelations to him. His intelligence manifested itself from an early age; he began teaching while still a young man, and he preached from city to city‚Äîfrom Fes to Rabat to Sal√©, passing through Zerhoun, Meknes, and other Moroccan cities. He taught Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Ibrahim al-Fassi of the Shadhili Sufi Order. He encouraged ijtihad, or independent thought and deliberation, and a break from taqlid, or conforming to tradition and orthodoxy. Leaders among the Ulama of Fes saw him as a threat and labeled him a heretic. He was summoned to Marrakesh in 1896/1897 to clarify his position to Sultan Abdelaziz after a rumor spread of his ideological deviancy and his plotting of an overthrow of power. The sultan pronounced his innocence of the accusation of plotting an overthrow, and referred the case of his ideological divergence to the religious scholars. It was agreed that they and he would meet, and these meetings went on for a few months, ultimately resulting in his exoneration of what he was accused of. Al-Kattani became, after these meetings, an adviser to Sultan Abdelaziz. He stayed some time in this role, then he was permitted to return to Fes.  Reform movement  In 1903, he went to Mecca to perform the Hajj. He spent some time teaching some of the scholars of the Hijaz at Great Mosque of Mecca. He also traveled through the Mashriq, visiting the Hijaz, the Levant, and Egypt, where he came into contact with important leaders and scholars, including Khedive Abbas Pasha I in Cairo and the Sharif Awn ar-Rafiq in Mecca, and called for reform in the region. al- Kattani taught many Egyptian scholars at Al-Azhar University, and met Khedive Isma'il Pasha for long talks, attempting to coordinate with him, the Ottoman Empire, and the Kingdom of Morocco to counter French imperialism. On his return from the East, he also visited Marseille and Naples, noting the extent of Europe's industrial, economic, and social advancement.ÿ≥ŸäÿØŸä ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸáÿØŸä ÿ®ŸÜ ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ®ŸÜ ÿπÿ®ÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ®Ÿäÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ™ÿßŸÜŸäÿßŸÑÿ∑ÿ±ŸäŸÇÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ™ÿßŸÜŸäÿ©ÿå ÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑŸàŸÑŸàÿ¨ 12 ÿ£ÿ®ÿ±ŸäŸÑ 2013 When he returned to Morocco in 1904/1905, he demanded a number of anti-colonial reforms. After visiting Marseille, which produced the sugarloaves imported by Morocco, he forbade his followers from drinking Moroccan tea, and encouraged them to oppose its consumption at gatherings and parties. This was an anti- colonial stance as he considered the import of tea from France to be disruptive of the Moroccan market. It was also clear that France was preparing to occupy Morocco, and al-Kattani advised the tribes to unite, put past feuds behind them, and prepare for jihad.  Press  at-TƒÅ'≈´n = After the 1906 Algeciras Conference, the Sufi leader al-Kataani started publishing a periodical entitled at-TƒÅ'≈´n ( The Plague) in response to the colonial press and European colonialism in general. = Es-Saada = Particularly after Wadii' Karam (), a Maronite man from Greater Syria, was appointed editor-in- chief in 1906, the Arabic newspaper es-Saada, published by the French Legation in Tangier to advance French colonial interests, led a defamation campaign against al-Kattani and the Ulama of Fes, describing them as \\"renegade revolutionary heretics.\\" Es-Saada published over 20 articles on the leader of the al-Kattani, his family, and his followers. The newspaper pushed the idea that the al-Kattani sought to overthrow the monarchy, and lusted after the sultan's power. > > \\"The Makhzen turned away from al-Kettani, understanding that the man's > intention is not to bring up religious matters but that he has an ulterior > motive that he dresses in religion. In this regard, the Makhzen did not > watch him enough, nor did it surveil his case enough. The Makhzen itself > knows what al-Kettani is hiding and knows his intention to pounce on the > king and his place in the hearts of the Berbers.\\"  Hafidiya  When France invaded Oujda, bombarded Casablanca, and invaded the Shawiya in 1907, al-Kattani called for jihad and the deportation of the colonists from the country and composed numerous letters calling for resistance against the occupiers. He also signed a letter addressed to the American ambassador at the American Legation in Tangier, urging the United States not to support Abdelaziz, who took a lax stance against the French occupiers. al-Kattani gathered the ulama of Fes and explained the situation to them. They agreed to withdraw support for Abdelaziz and to support his brother, Abdelhafid, under two main conditions: that he seek public opinion, or shura, in important decisions and that he continue the fight against the colonists. al-Kattani wrote the terms under which the people of Fes would support him. In the Hafidiya, Muhammad al-Katani refused to fight Abdelaziz and his followers to avoid Muslim on Muslim violence. He also condemned Sultan Abdelhafid's detention and torture of supporters of the former sultan Abdelaziz in Meknes and the sequestration of their funds, and refused to act as an intermediary between the two sides. al-Katani repeatedly requested that Sultan Abdelhafid abide by the terms of the bay'ah, writing to him about this over and over, warning him of the risks of Morocco's descending into gorge of colonialism. He also released a fatwa ordaining a campaign of jihad against the colonialists, calling for an armed blockade of the French army at Tariq Za'ir outside of Rabat.ÿπŸÑŸÖÿßÿ° ŸÜÿßÿµÿ≠ŸàŸÜ: ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ®ŸÜ ÿπÿ®ÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ®Ÿäÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ™ÿßŸÜŸä 2/1ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÖÿßÿπÿ©, ÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑŸàŸÑŸàÿ¨ 9 ÿ£ÿ®ÿ±ŸäŸÑ 2013 In order to foster the reconciliation of feuding tribes and present a united Moroccan front against French colonialism, al- Kattani organized a conference of tribes of the Middle Atlas held in Meknes on March 15, 1908. His father participated in this movement of jihad too, and joined him at the conference, in which they agreed to wage jihad against the French and Spanish colonizers.  Death  al-Kattani fled Fes with his family and his followers in 1909. He was captured the forces of Sultan Abdelhafid, shaved, handcuffed, and paraded through the streets. His hands were cut off and his wounds were salted. He was beaten in front of his wives and children, and his body was thrown into an unmarked grave.  Works  He left a corpus of over 300 pieces, of which about 27 were printed as books. He also left a diwan, or poetry collection, characterized as Sufi, philosophical, and romantic.

The Bank was modeled after Grameen Bank, which was founded by Muhammad Yunus. According to the act, the government of Bangladesh would own 51 percent of the shares and members of Ektee Bari Ektee Khamar project (One House, One Farm project) would own rest of the shares. The bank would start with 10 billion taka authorised capital and 2 billion taka paid-up capital. The proposal for the bank was opposed by Bangladesh Bank and Bank and Financial Institutions Division of the Ministry of Finance. They recommended that instead of a bank, a financial institute be created. They believed that bank would fail to do its purpose like other specialised banks. The move to created the Bank was initially opposed by the Ministry of Finance. In 2018, the Palli Sanchay Bank announced plans to open branches in 462 Upazila (sub-district) of Bangladesh, having opened branches in 406 Upazilas by February 2018.

It contains 9412 glosses, including 3478 in Old Irish.. Together with the W√ºrzburg glosses on the Epistles of St Paul and the Milan glosses on a Commentary on the Psalms they provide the main source of Old Irish writing available today and thus serve as an important reference for linguistic research on Old Irish.  Origin of manuscript  The original Institutiones Grammaticae was written by Priscian between 526 and 527, and was subsequently used in Ireland to teach Latin grammar. Cod. Sang. 904 is one of four complete surviving manuscripts. It is thought to have been written around 845 ad. in Ireland, possibly in either Nendrum or Bangor, the original home of St. Gall. The manuscript was written by two scribes, as suggested by the second scribe's note at the beginning of his part in the text. In addition, three minor scribes added corrections. According to a note on page 89, the manuscript was copied off two models.  Contents and description  The beginning of Cod. Sang. 904 Cod. Sang. 904 contains 249 pages, but the pagination jumps from page 78 to page 88, reducing the actual number of pages to 240. It is written on thick parchment, possibly vellum, and there are a number of patched holes and grease stains. The pages are divided into two columns of 42 lines each. The ink used is dark brown and black. The initials of books and chapters are decorated with flora and fauna elements in the typical Irish style. Cod. Sang. 904 includes the first 16 Books of Priscian and part of Book 17 until GL 3, 147, 18 \\"naturaliter\\". Apart from a caesura at the end of the fifth quire, the text is written continuously. It is written in Insular script.  Glosses  Cod. Sang. 904 is known for its numerous glosses in Latin and Old Irish. It also contains eight entries in Ogham writing and subsequently comprises the oldest source of Ogham writing in a manuscript. The first three glosses on pages 50, 70, and 170 respectively, are indicators of the dates of writing. The following four entries on pages 193-196 indicate that corrections were made. The last gloss on page 204 offers a more personal note from the scribe, the Old Irish word latheirt. Damian McManus presents the translation in \\"A Guide to Ogham\\": \\"This [definition] together with other contexts shows the basic meaning to be 'excessive ale-consumption' with the logical extensions 'excessive drunkenness' and 'massive hangover', the last probably the meaning intended in the Priscian Oghams.\\" Among the most valuable and interesting glosses are the only recorded instances of two Old Irish poems. The first is the anonymous 9th century poem Is acher in ga√≠th in-nocht. The second is on page 203 of the manuscript and reads as follows: > (m.i.) Domfarcai fidbaidae f√°l. fomchain l√≥id luin l√∫ad nad c√©l. huas mo > lebr√°n indl√≠nech. fomchain tr√≠rech inna·πÖ√©n .., Fommchain c√≥i menn medair > mass. hi·πÅbrot glass de dindgnaib doss. debrath nomchoimmdiu c√≥ima. > c√°inscr√≠baimm for√≥ida r. \\"A hedge of trees surrounds me: a blackbird‚Äôs lay > sings to me‚Äîpraise which I will not hide‚Äî above my booklet the lined one the > trilling of the birds sings to me.

As an author, she is particularly known for fiction aimed at children and youth and for her work as publisher and editor of the Alma feminina feminist magazine. Early years Sarah de Vasconcelos Carvalho Beir√£o (she used \\"Sara\\" professionally) was born on 30 July 1880, in T√°bua, Portugal. She was the daughter of Maria Jos√© da Costa Mathias and Doctor Francisco de Vasconcellos Carvalho Beir√£o. She studied in Porto, receiving an education available to very few girls at that time, and began working for newspapers at the age of 18, namely for the periodical O Tabuense, founded by her father, as well as for newspapers in Beira Alta Province and for the magazine Humanidade, using the male the pseudonym of √Ålvaro de Vasconcelos. Activism In May 1909, Beir√£o became actively involved in the Republican cause, assisting in the organization at the first republican rally held in T√°bua, and taking part in the inauguration of the Centro Republicano Tabuense, chaired by her father. Republicans in Portugal at that time were aiming to substitute the Constitutional Monarchy by a Republic. In the same month, she joined the Portuguese League of Peace, which emphasised the achievement of peace through the efforts of women, as well as the Republican League of Portuguese Women, becoming president of the T√°bua branch. In 1910, Beir√£o married Ant√≥nio da Costa Carvalho. The couple moved to the Portuguese capital Lisbon in 1928, where she joined the ‚ÄúGroup of Thirteen‚Äù (Grupo das Treze), a women‚Äôs organization that aimed to combat the ignorance and superstition, dogmatism and religious conservatism that existed in Portuguese society and that prevented women‚Äôs emancipation. She also joined the Conselho Nacional das Mulheres Portuguesas (National Council of Portuguese Women), founded by activist doctor Adelaide Cabete in 1914. Beir√£o was to become president on the death of Cabete and held the position from 1935 to 1941, being honorary president in 1942. In addition to her activism in the defence of women's rights and gender equality, Beir√£o was also a philanthropist, focusing on helping the most disadvantaged children and the elderly. The Sarah Beir√£o and Ant√≥nio Costa Carvalho Foundation was created in 1964, to operate a care home in T√°bua for retired artists and writers of both sexes. This was mainly for long-term residents with physical or economic difficulties and was housed in an 18th century manor house, home of Beir√£o's grandparents and her birthplace. It currently supports around 100 residents and day-care patients. Writing In literature, Sara Beir√£o wrote mostly fiction, for both adults and children. As one of the most successful Portuguese writers during the 20th century, she published 16 books, including two collections of short stories. Her works were represented at the ‚ÄúExhibition of Books Written by Women‚Äù organized by Maria Lamas and the Conselho Nacional das Mulheres Portuguesas in 1947. This brought together three thousand books by 1400 women authors from thirty countries, and filled the Great Hall of Fine Arts at the University of Lisbon. She contributed to several newspapers and magazines, such as O Primeiro de Janeiro in Porto, Di√°rio de Coimbra in Coimbra, and Jornal de Not√≠cias and Di√°rio de Not√≠cias in Lisbon, as well as for the Brazilian print media. Her articles and regular columns were usually targeted at women. From the mid-1930s she was Director and Editor of, and regular contributor to, Alma Feminina magazine, published by the Conselho Nacional das Mulheres Portuguesas until that organization was closed by the authoritarian Estado Novo regime in 1947. Many of its articles were dedicated to Portuguese feminists such as Adelaide Cabete, Ana de Castro Os√≥rio, and Elina Guimar√£es and well as those from outside Portugal, such as Avril de Sainte-Croix, Jane Addams, and Simone de Beauvoir. Beir√£o died in T√°bua, on 21 May 1974, at the age of 93. She is remembered in that city by a public garden (Jardim Sarah Beir√£o) and streets have been named after her in several other locations.

It is currently an IETF Internet draft, and has been in use by Cloudflare and Facebook, with browser support by Firefox. Motivation Modern websites and other services use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), which are servers potentially distributed all over the world, in order to respond to a user's request as fast as possible, alongside other services that CDNs provide such as DDoS mitigation. However, in order to establish a secure connection, the server is required to prove possession of a private key associated with a certificate, which serves as a chain of trust linking the public key and a trusted party. The trusted party is normally a certificate authority (CA). CAs issue these digital certificates with an expiration time, usually a few months up to a year. It is the server's responsibility to renew the certificate close to its expiration date. Knowledge of a private key associated to a valid certificate is devastating for the site's security, as it allows Man-in-the-middle attacks, in which a malicious entity can impersonate to a user as a legitimate server. Therefore, these private keys should be kept secure, preferably not distributed over every server in the CDN. Specifically, if a private key is compromised, the corresponding certificate should optimally be revoked, such that browsers will no longer support this certificate. Certificate revocation has two main drawbacks. Firstly, current revocation methods do not work well across all browsers, and put the users at risk; and secondly, upon revocation, the server needs to quickly fetch a new valid certificate from the CA and deploy it across all mirrors. Design A delegated credential is in fact a short-lived (from a few hours to a few days) key that the certificate's owner delegates to the server for use in TLS. It is in fact a signature: the certificate's owner uses the certificate's private key to sign a delegated public key, and an expiration time. It is unclear from the specs which party generates the delegated (private key, public key) pair . Given this delegated credential, a browser can (if it supports it) verify the server's authenticity by verifying the delegated certificate and then verify the certificate itself. Advantages This approach has many advantage over current solutions: * Certificates are short-lived, so if it is compromised it could only be abused for a very short time. * No revocation is needed for stolen certificates. * The certificate's owner needs not disclose its private key to the CDN servers, but rather periodically supply them with delegated credentials. * The delegated credential has its own key, so it can experiment with new algorithms such as Ed25519. This can be seen as a crypto-agile approach.

It was opened in December 1907 to provide furnished accommodation for people in need. Designed in an Arts and Crafts Vernacular style by Thomas Ball Silcock and Samuel Sebastian Reay of Silcock and Reay, architects at Bath and London, twelve cottages were constructed on three sides of a quadrangle, with landscaped gardens. The third, or south side, is enclosed by a low terrace wall with wrought iron gates. A large stone sundial, with a spreading base, is set in the centre of the quadrangle. In their original form, each house had a living room, with a small scullery, larder, coal house, and one bedroom with a large storeroom. Sidney Hill, a wealthy local businessman and benefactor, paid for the construction costs and endowed a fund to maintain the homes. Sidney Hill Churchill Wesleyan Cottage Homes, a registered charitable trust and a member of the National Association of Almshouses, continues to manage the homes and provide accommodation for local people in need. The trust also funds the maintenance of the communal garden and operates the heating system which services the houses. History Illustration of Sidney Hill Cottage Homes by Thomas Raffles Davison in 1909. On 12 May 1904, Sidney Hill purchased at auction a plot of pasture and arable land in Churchill called The Vicarage Close for ¬£500. The plot contained that consisted of three lots numbered 166, 168, and 169 on the Churchill tithe map..Hill's intention was to build furnished cottage homes (or almshouses) at Vicarage Close for people of advanced years, in difficult circumstances, and without near relatives. This would be Hill's second set of cottage homes after he built and furnished six dwellings known as the Victoria Jubilee Homes at Langford in commemoration of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The homes in Churchill were built by Isaac Ford and Sons of Cheddar, to an Arts and Crafts design by the architects Thomas Ball Silcock and Samuel Sebastian Reay of Silcock and Reay, at Bath and London. Sidney Hill and Silcock were political allies: Hill was a vicepresident of the Liberal Association in Wells and nominated Silcock as the Liberal candidate for the 1906 General Election. Silcock and Reay's coloured drawing of the homes was sufficiently wellregarded to be included in the 1906 and 1907 Royal Academy Exhibitions. The cost of the buildings, exclusive of the cost of land, amounted to ¬£11,000, and the furniture in the homes, the trustees' room, and the matron's cottage, amounted to a further ¬£1,915. The gardens and planting cost an additional ¬£900. The homes bear the inscription \\"The Sidney Hill Churchill Wesleyan Cottage Homes\\" and were opened in December 1907. The first residents were chosen personally by Sidney Hill with preference given to followers of the Wesleyan movement. Robert Stone, a blacksmith at the forge opposite the homes, had a cottage where the homes were built. The cottage was demolished during construction, and he and his wife became the first family to enter the homes. Each occupant of the homes was given a sufficient weekly sum for maintenance. On 13 January 1908, John Durban Loveless, Sidney Hill's agent, was presented with an illuminated address and silver salver by Silock and Reay in recognition of his efforts to complete the home. The presentation was made by Silcock, then the Liberal MP for the Wells Division of Somerset, and the address was designed and illuminated by Reay. The land and buildings were gifted to the Sidney Hill Churchill Wesleyan Cottage Homes trust in October 1906. After the death of Sidney Hill in 1908, and four years after the death of his nephew who had succeeded him, Thomas Sidney Hill, his great nephew took over as chair of the trust. Since that time various other local people have been nominated to the board of trustees including, up until this day, many direct descendants of the Hill family. In 1958, the trust became a member of the National Association of Almshouses, and in January 1962, a registered charitable trust. The occupants were not asked to make a residential contribution until 1972, and since that time, there have been annual increases; now a contribution is made which is comparable with modern rented accommodation. The trust funds the maintenance of the communal garden and operates the heating system which services the houses. Architecture The houses stand on land containing , elevated about above Front Street in Churchill, with a field of south of the main buildings and reserved in perpetuity as an open space. They are arranged on three sides of a quadrangle about square, its open side facing south with a view to woods on the Mendip Hills. The south side is enclosed by a low brick terrace wall coped with stone and ornamented with carved stone vases, and in the centre is a gateway with wrought iron gates giving access to working gardens. Wide stonepaved paths run round the four sides of the quadrangle, the south path is terminated at each end with a large arbour arranged under the main roof, which is supported by oak posts and balustrades, each arbour contained oak seats and tables. A low, brick parapet wall encloses the quadrangle, with stone steps leading down to the lawn and flower borders; these are sunk some below the level of the stone paved paths, and in the centre is a large stone sundial (see ¬ßSundial). The front of the building faces Front Street in Churchill, and is set back from the road by a courtyard that has lawns and paths with flower borders and trees. A terrace wall of brick with large stone vases separates the courtyard from the road. The courtyard is approached by steps through entrance gates made of wrought iron with a bell turret and weather vane over the central archway. The north, east, and west sides of the houses have gables and recessed arbours that have arches supported by oak posts. The doorways are constructed from arched oak frames and doors; the doors in the quadrangle have moulded hoods supported by carved corbels. The walls are of sandfaced brick, with handmade red roof tiles, oak window frames with iron casements and lead window glazing. The stone used for the copings, piers and finials is Cotswold stone, a yellow, oolitic Jurassic limestone, that was mined at Temple Guiting quarry, in Gloucestershire, England. It was chosen as its colour would harmonise with the warm tones of the walls and roofs. In the original design, each house had a living room, with a small scullery, larder, coal house, and a bedroom with a large storeroom. Over the entrance to the quadrangle is a large meeting room, reached by a spiral stone staircase. The room is panelled to a height of , with windows at each end, on which are the coat of arms of Sidney Hill. The room also has a stone fireplace with Hill's motto inscribed on the mantelpiece. The living rooms in the homes had fireplaces set in golden brown bricks with raised hearths of the same material. The bedroom fireplaces had green tile surrounds and tiled hearths, and all the fireplaces had simple oak mantels. A fire guard was provided for each living room, and bells enabled each house to communicate with the others in case of emergency. The homes were furnished with oak furniture designed by Silcock and Reay. In the south west corner of the site a small laundry was built together with outbuildings. Sundial The quadrangle at Sidney Hill Cottage Homes looking towards the central archway and sundial. The central archway towards the quadrangle and the sundial. Sidney Hill's coat of arms is shown over the archway. A large stone sundial, designed by Silcock and Reay, stands on a base of brick in the centre of the quadrangle, and is listed separately as a Grade II monument by Historic England. It has a limestone mid course and cornice, and a hexagonal stone shaft metres high, developing from four consoles that have decorative features in lead. A square sundial, with four bronze plates and a ball finial, are affixed to the top of the shaft. The four brass plates bear the following: { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders mw-collapsible\\" style=\\"margin-right: 0; background-color: white;\\" + style=\\"text-align: left; background-color: white;\\"  - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"text-align: left; background-color: cornflowerblue; color: aliceblue;\\"  Direction ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"text-align: left; background-color: cornflowerblue; color: aliceblue; width: 25%;\\"  Description ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"text-align: left; background-color: cornflowerblue; color: aliceblue;\\"  Notes ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"text-align: centre; background-color: cornflowerblue; color: aliceblue;\\"  - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\"  North  Arms of Sidney Hill  According to FoxDavies in Armorial Families (1895), Hill bore:  - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\"  East  Motto of Sidney Hill  Stone in The Routledge Dictionary of Latin Quotations (2005), translates the motto, Omne bonum Dei donum, as \\"Every good thing is a gift of God\\" and is taken from James, chapter 1, verse 17.  - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\"  South  Vertical sundial  John Parish White and Sons of The Pyghtle Works, Bedford, supplied the sundial, decorative lead, stonework and plates.

Bowditch. Whittier wrote the quatrain originally as an inscription for a sundial plate owned by Dr. Henry Ingersoll Bowditch. Matron's house The Matron's house at Sidney Hill Cottage Homes. A matron's house was built in the north west corner of the site, adjoining Front Street, containing two sitting rooms, a kitchen, three bedrooms, and a bathroom. The matron's house is listed as a Grade II building by Historic England separately from the other buildings on the site. It is one storey building, with a (now converted) attic, constructed from red brick with a plain tiled roof. The windows have three wooden casements with small leaded panes; those to the attic are under gables. There are two Tudor arched doorways with plank doors to south and east fronts. There is a wooden round arched loggia to the east front and a gabled porch to the south front. Architectural importance There is no overarching architectural style within Churchill. However, the Sidney Hill Cottage Homes is unique within the village, with its ornate brick work, ironwork railings and lampposts, large concrete urns, bell tower and weather vane, and in the central courtyard, the sundial. In particular, the gate piers with their carved stone vases and wrought iron gates are an exciting testimony to late Victorian architecture. In contrast, the predominant construction material in the larger, detached Georgian buildings is local stone, interspersed with much older, more traditional cottages, and postwar, detached bungalows and houses. There are a few other structures with distinctive brickwork features in the area that include the Jubilee Clock Tower and Methodist church.

He was hereditary lord of Santorini in the Cyclades, and served as official and military commander for the Venetian Republic. Andrea was the firstborn son of Iacopo Barozzi, lord of Santorini and Therasia. He succeeded his father upon his death . Unlike most Venetians who had established petty principalities in the Aegean in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, the Barozzi remained loyal to the Republic, and often served in various public offices. In 1252, the Venetian authorities ceded Andrea Barozzi two knightly fiefs in the Venetian colony of Crete. In 1258‚Äì59 he held the high office of Bailo of Negroponte. At that time, he negotiated a treaty to end the War of the Euboeote Succession, between the Triarchs of Negroponte, who had been backed by Venice, and William II of Villehardouin, the Prince of Achaea. Barozzi also renewed the 1256 treaty with the Triarchs in terms advantageous to Venice. In 1264, he was placed in command of a fleet of ships to prevent the Genoese from raiding the annual trade convoy to the Levant. He was tricked, however, by the Genoese commander, Simone Grillo: Grillo spread rumours that he intended to head due east to the Levant, whereas in reality he took up station at Malta. When Barozzi took the bait and moved east to pursue Grillo with his much larger fleet, the latter was free to attack the Venetian convoy off Saseno, and capture it almost in its entirety; only the giant merchant ship Roccafortis escaped. In the meantime, Barozzi was pressing on eastwards, searching in vain for Grillo's fleet. Arriving before Tyre on 2 September, he encountered a Genoese merchantman carrying 11,000 bezants worth of silk, the Oliva, in the harbour. With the Genoese fleet nowhere in sight, Barozzi resolved to seize the ship, despite the warnings of the city's lord, Philip of Montfort, a Genoese ally, that he would confiscate double the amount in Venetian properties if they did so. Barozzi did not hesitate long: he not only captured the Oliva, but also began a siege of Tyre itself, in the hopes of depriving Genoa of access to this, the second-most important port city of the Levant. The Venetians had to interrupt the siege after a few days, however, when news of the events at Saseno reached them. Instead, Barozzi hurried to Acre to escort the previous year's returning convoy back to Venice. In the mid-1270s, he lost his lordship of Santorini, which was reconquered by the Byzantine Empire under the admiral Licario. Andrea Barozzi is attested for the last time in 1278, and likely died soon after.

The church is dedicated to St Aldhelm who lived in Malmesbury and was the abbot at nearby Malmesbury Abbey. Buildings St Aldhelm's Roman Catholic Church is built in uncoursed stone with ashlar dressings, in 14th-century gothic style. It is set back from the town's market place, to which it presents its west fa√ßade where a large two- light trefoil-headed window is flanked by two plain lancets. Immediately south of the church is the presbytery. The Grade II Listed building incorporates a single-storey 19th-century former stable to Cross Hayes House, built in squared limestone, with a later rear extension in limestone rubble. History The church was founded in 1875 by French priest Francois Larive MSFS, who was the first Missionary of St Francis de Sales to work in England. The idea of founding a church in Malmesbury was given to him by Captain Charles Goddard Dewell of the 91st Argyllshire Regiment of Foot, who was born and raised in Malmesbury. The two met in 1858 while Captain Dewell was posted to the village of Kamptee in India. Dewell had recently been baptised into the Roman Catholic Church after being converted to Catholicism following falling ill while serving in Italy. He wanted to start a church in his home town, so after much discussion with Father Larive, the two decided to try to set up a church in Malmesbury. In 1861, Father Larive and Dewell came to Malmesbury, and they decided on a site for the church: Cross Hayes House, which was owned by Dewell. There were delays with the transfer of the lease of the house, so it did not become available until 1867. It was in that year that Captain Dewell became a lay brother in the Society of Jesus and opened a school, despite fierce local opposition, including from the local member of parliament. A temporary church was set up on newly purchased adjoining land in 1869, and used until the present church was opened on 1 July 1875. Father Larive dedicated the church to St Aldhelm who was the abbot at the nearby Malmesbury Abbey and patron saint of the town. The site of the old church became St. Joseph's Primary School, run by and named after the Sisters of St Joseph of Annecy with whom Father Larive had previously worked. The school remained here until 1933 when it moved to its current site on Holloway Hill.

Mikhail Nakashidze is credited with proposing and designing one of the first armored cars in the world, and arranging its introduction, construction and delivery to the Russian Empire. The \\"Charron- Nakashidze\\" was built by the French automobile company Charron, which at the time was co-headed by Nakashidze, who persuaded the Russian general staff to commission their acquisition. The first armored car of the Russian Empire The uparmored Charron-Nakashidze was built in 1905 for the Russian Empire. Based on his experiences in the Manchurian war, Nakashidze proposed a draft for an armored car design to General Nikolai Linevich of the 1st Manchurian Army. Shortly before the conclusion of the Russo-Japanese War he presented his idea to the Ministry of War of the Russian Empire where Nakashidze's initiative was supported by General Linevich. The idea was approved, however, there was no construction plants that could produce armored vehicles in Russia, which is why design and order were handed over to French company Charron. Prince Nakashidze was the co-owner of Charron, a position he probably used to lobby the company's interests in Russia. Charron had already constructed an armored car, the Charron, Girardot et Voigt in 1902. The same vehicle was the basis for a more combat effective and uparmoured variant designed by Nakashidze in 1905, which was finished the same year, referred to as \\"Charron-Nakashidze\\". The original construction order of 36 cars was initially reduced to one experimental prototype for field testing in Russia. The overall impressions were positive. The vehicle had a high ground clearance, armoured wheel disks, a portable bridging device to negotiate obstacles such as trenches, revolving turret with one machine gun mounted and another in reserve, and was clad in 4‚Äì5 mm thick armour. All trials had a generally favourable outcome and the commissions concluded that the vehicle had great value for reconnaissance behind enemy lines, as well as communication, and anti-cavalry operations. A total of eight Charron- Nakashidze's were constructed for the Russian army.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/ba-czar-1.htm The French kept two vehicles. Death On 12 August Prince Nakashidze visited the then Minister of Internal Affairs of the Russian Empire, Pyotr Stolypin to propose an improved version of the Charron, which was upgraded with results and criticism from the field trials taken into account. However, at the reception, he was caught in the blast of an assassination attempt on Stolypin. Nakashidze was found among the 30 dead, and all his documents were lost. No further orders were approved by the Russian War Department. Partially due to this, the Russian army was left with very few armored vehicles at the outbreak of World War I.

It tells of the deeds of one or multiple deities referred to as \\"sages,\\" beginning from the creation of the world. It combines many stories that appear independently in other regions of Korea into a single extended narrative. In the first story, the deity Seokga usurps the world from the creator, creates animals from deer meat, and destroys a superfluous sun and moon. In the second, the carpenter Gangbangdek builds a palace for the gods, loses a wager to a woman, and becomes the god of the household. In the third and fourth stories, a boy who does not talk until the age of ten becomes the founder of a new Buddhist temple and melts a baby into iron to forge a temple bell. In the fifth, the same priest destroys a rich man for having abused him. Finally, the priest makes his three sons the gods of fertility, ending the story. The narrative has a strong Buddhist influence. Source and ritual context The Seng-gut narrative was recited on September 26, 1965, by Gang Chun-ok, a female shaman from Hamhung who had fled North Korea during the Division of Korea. The Seng- gut was a large-scale gut ritual in the Hamgyong region, in which shamans beseeched the gods for long life, sons, and fortune generally. Seng or seoin means \\"sage; holy person\\" in Northwestern Korean, and is here used to refer to a variety of shamanic deities that appear in the garb of a Buddhist priest. With the exception of the Gangbangdek story, the narrative has a strong Buddhist influence throughout. According to scholar Kim Heonsun, the only transcription (by ethnologists Lim Seok-jae and Chang Chu-keun) is riddled with serious orthographic errors and mistranscriptions. Myth=Creation narrative The Seng-gut narrative opens with the spontaneous generation of the universe, as heaven opens in the direction of zi and earth opens in the direction of chou. This statement is copied verbatim from the philosophical cosmogony proposed by the eleventh-century Chinese philosopher Shao Yong. Humans are created from red clay, which is why they return to the earth upon death. In this primeval world, birds and horses can talk, trees can walk, horses have horns and bulls have manes, and dogs have combs and chickens have ears. This is followed by a discussion of the sage-kings of ancient China, from Tianhuang to Yu the Great, founder of Xia. The Indian sage (Northwestern Korean: ) Seokga, the Korean name for Shakyamuni, studies in the Western Heaven for nine years. After entering the human world to preach Buddhism in the East and Christianity in the West, he finds Korea under the rule of the creator god Mireuk, the Korean name for Maitreya. He tells him to hand over Korea; the creator refuses, and a series of contentions begins. First, Seokga and Mireuk play \\"immortal go\\" and \\"immortal janggi.\\" Next, they each try using a rock to moor a boat whose rigging is of sand. Seokga is triumphant both times, because Mireuk is \\"foolish\\" while Seokga is \\"full of ruses and full of artifice, with cunning stratagems.\\" Mireuk refuses to accept his defeats.\\"ÎØ∏Îü∞Ìïú\\"; \\"Í≤åÍ≥† ÎßéÍ≥† Î©îÍæÄ ÎßéÍ≥† ÏàòÎã®Ïù¥ Ï¢ãÏùÄ\\" Finally, they hold a contest to grow a flower while both are asleep. Mireuk sleeps genuinely, but Seokga only pretends to sleep. When a chrysanthemum blooms near the sleeping Mireuk, Seokga plucks it and places it in his own lap. When Mireuk awakes and realizes Seokga's cheating, he departs but curses the world: > \\"When it becomes your age, humans will be born like millet grains. From the > day they are born they will have thievery in their hearts. There will be two > moons in the sky and two suns in the sky. When it is night, things will > freeze three feet and three inches, and when it is day, things will burn > three feet and three inches, and humanity will freeze to death and burn to > death and the humans that survive will be unhulled grains in hulled millet > grains.

Seokga resolves to return to the Western Heaven to end this calamity. On the way, he finds a deer crying while crossing the road. The god throws a six-hooked staff at the animal, immediately killing it. He orders the deer to be roasted for its meat, but his two servants refuse to eat the meat, saying that they would rather become Buddhas. While eating, Seokga spits out some of deer meat into the waters, thereby creating the fishes of the world. Then he spits towards the sky and creates the birds. He spits a final time, and the meat crawls and runs away as the animals of the earth. Making his way west, Seokga encounters a river three thousand leagues wide. The fish‚Äîhis creations‚Äîallow him to cross on their backs, but scatter when his two servants attempt to cross. Going alone, Seokga meets a beautiful woman named Dongjibaek, who lives below the road, and a hideous woman named Sesi-aegi, who lives above the road. Only the latter tells him the directions to the Western Heaven. When Seokga finally reaches the Western Heaven, a Buddha there tells him to thread three thousand beads together with a single string. He asks the two women for help, but only Sesi-aegi reveals the solution: to smear the beads with honey and tie the string to a fire ant, which will thread the beads together while being lured by the honey. The Buddha then destroys the doubled sun and moon for Seokga and uses them to create the stars, the \\"map of the Son of Heaven of Zhongyuan,\\" and \\"the map of the Son of Heaven of Korea.\\" On his return to Korea, Seokga confers divinity to Sesi-aegi but dooms Dongjibaek to working in the smithy. He crosses the river on the backs of fish again and discovers that his two servants have turned into giant boulders. He makes one the god of the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, and the other the god of the (mythical) Seven Stars of the Southern Dipper. Back in Korea, Seokga thrashes a mouse three times until it reveals the secret of making fire (to strike iron on stone) and thrashes a frog three times until it reveals the secret to finding water (to dig for aquifers underground). Finally, the god teaches humanity about the inevitability of death; the implication is that death did not exist before Seokga entered Korea. He is eventually cremated. He ascends into heaven, and his ashes crystallize into sarira pearls. Gangbangdek narrative The Jade Emperor wishes to build a new palace and attempts to enlist the help of a sage (seoin) named Gangbangdek, a deity reincarnated as a human carpenter. The spider volunteers to bring him and weaves a web in front of Gangbangdek's door, but the carpenter kills the spider. The owl then goes to bring him to heaven, but Gangbangdek kills the bird with an arrow. A god named Eotteoki reveals that Gangbangdek is protected from the gods by an amber headband brooch, a coral topknot pin, and a blade made of wood from a lightning-struck peach tree. Eotteoki strikes the man with a sleeping disease, so that he falls asleep even while standing. Gangbangdek takes a bath to rouse himself. When he drops his brooch, his pin, and his blade, Eotteoki spirits his soul away. Gangbangdek tells the Jade Emperor that he will need to use a tree that grows on Mount Penglai, whose branches number ten thousand and whose roots stretch out for three thousand leagues, in order to build the palace. The god commissions three thousand human craftsmen and three thousand oxen to help him in the project, and three thousand people and three thousand oxen fall dead in the human world so that their souls can cut down the tree. While transporting the Penglai tree to the Jade Emperor's realm, Gangbangdek encounters a weaving woman named Mosi-gakssi, who proposes a challenge to the carpenter. She will weave a thousand dong (two million Chinese feet, or six hundred kilometers) of ramie cloth alone. If she finishes weaving before Gangbangdek finishes the palace, he must give all his pay to her. If Gangbangdek finishes first, she will gift him all thousand dong of cloth. Mosi-gakssi, who weaves with her loom amid the clouds, finishes earlier by a few days. The Jade Emperor gives her all of the carpenter's pay. Gangbangdek is incensed and curses the palace. Soon upon making it his residence, the Jade Emperor falls ill. He consults his servants, who tell him that he must venerate Gangbangdek as Seongju, the god of the household. The Jade Emperor holds an enormous gut for the carpenter, involving tens of thousands of dong of cloth and tens of thousands of seok of rice. The Jade Emperor's disease is cured, and Gangbangdek becomes worshipped widely as Seongju today. Miraculous birth and temple bell narratives A wealthy couple, Ching'ae-dure and Ching'ae-seonbi, are childless even as they are nearing forty. One day, a Buddhist priest and sage (seoin) comes on an alms round. Chinag'ae-dure asks him if there is any way she can have a child, promising the priest as much food as he could possibly want. The priest tells her to pray with her husband at the mythical Golden Temple, and vanishes without receiving any food. After praying at the Golden Temple, Ching'ae-dure gives birth to a beautiful boy, but he never cries as a baby and has not learnt to speak even by the age of ten. When the sage returns, Ching'ae-dure asks him if he knows how to make the child speak. He tells her to pray with her husband at the Golden Mountain to the god of the Seven Stars. When they do so, their son speaks for the first time, while dancing an immortal's dance: Korean Buddhist temple bell > \\"Mother, look at how I act. Father, look at how I am. I will go to the > Buddhist temple where I was made and become a sage.\\"\\"'Ïò§ÎßàÏù¥ ÎÇ¥Í±∞Îë• Î≥¥ÏãúÏöî ÏïÑÎ∂ÄÎãò ÎÇ¥ Î™®Ïñë > Î≥¥ÏãúÏöî ÎÇòÎäî ÎÇ¥ ÏÉùÍ∏¥ Ï†àÍ∞ÑÏóê ÏÑúÏù∏ÎãòÏúºÎ°ú Í∞ÄÍ≤†Ïä¥ÎãàÎã§'\\" Though his parents are devastated, the boy leaves forever. He goes to the Golden Temple, whose priests abuse and expel him for dancing an immortal's dance. The boy goes to a nearby hill and curses the temple, which is then \\"swept away.\\" The priests of the temple who abused him are transformed into rat snakes. The boy-sage takes the Buddha statue and the remaining priests to found the new Geumgang Temple at the mythical Mount Anhe. The sage sends his priests to the Eight Provinces of Korea to collect iron to forge a bell for Geumgang Temple, and goes personally to the house of a man named Wonsan-durei because he knows that something strange is there. Wonsan-durei's family is desperately poor, and the wife says that they cannot afford to give him \\"cast iron, or raw iron, or even broken iron\\"; all they have is their three-year-old son Wonmaek.\\"Î¨¥Ïá†ÎèÑ ÏóÜÍ≥† ÏÉùÏá†Îëê ÏóÜÍ≥† ÌååÏá†Îëê ÏóÜÍ≥†\\" The sage convinces her to donate at least Wonmaek's spoon and returns to the temple. Though the priests pool together and melt their iron, they find that it cannot be forged into a bell. The sage tells a priest to bring Wonmaek to him, and the priest persuades the mother to give him the child under the condition that he be returned once the \\"great business of the temple\\" is done. The webs of purseweb spiders sprout on the road by which Wonmaek goes to the temple. When the child arrives, the priests mix blood from his middle finger into the molten iron, but forging is still impossible. Finally, Wonmaek volunteers to enter the molten iron himself under the condition that he be wrapped in silk when he enters. The child is thus melted alive into the iron. The bell is finally forged with the sacrifice, but the priests find that they have made a talking bell that speaks with Wonmaek's voice. The sage holds a shamanic ritual to appease and liberate the child's soul. Three years later, the bell has become unusable as moss has grown all over it. Fifteen workers destroy the bell and shatter it into pieces. The shards are retrieved by shamans, who reforge them to make their sacred drums. Jangja narrative While on an alms round, the sage of Geumgang Temple journeys to the house of a rich man (Korean: jangja) in Hamgyong Province who has accumulated wealth for a thousand years. When the man refuses to give him alms and abuses him, the sage curses the house. His pots will go on walks, mushrooms will sprout in his rice bags, his thousand-year-old copper columns will be worm-eaten, and so forth, and when such things happen he should know that he is \\"done for.\\" The rich man's daughter-in-law warns him that the sage is cursing them, but he admonishes her for wanting to let vagrants in the house. The daughter-in-law secretly visits the sage with alms and asks him to forgive her father-in-law, saying that he has been senile for three years. The priest tells her to leave the house the next morning and to never look back, and vanishes. The next morning, it is all as the sage has said. The rich man's pots are walking by themselves, there are mushrooms in his rice bags, and worms are eating into copper columns. The daughter-in-law begs her father-in- law to understand the situation, but he remains stubbornly ignorant. > \\"Father, what should do we do? The priest who came yesterday was completely > right... He said that we would be done for.\\" \\"Huh, what do you mean, 'be > done for'?

The rich man's house has been replaced by a pond, with only a pair of mallard ducks to be seen. The woman and the kitten immediately turn into rock. Jeseok bon-puri A very rich man and his family go to Seoul, leaving only their virgin daughter Seji-aegi behind. Knowing this, the sage of Geumgang Temple visits the mansion as a Buddhist priest asking for alms. Seji- aegi tells her servant to give him rice, but the priest receives it in a bottomless bowl so that all of it spills. When she asks him why he will not accept her alms, he says that he will not receive any rice that she has not offered him personally, grain by grain. She does so, and the sage's robe and her skirt blow, touch, and tear in the southeast wind. When the sun sets, Seji-aegi allows the priest to sleep in a back annex of the mansion. When he claims he cannot stand the smell of horse leather, she moves him to a room in the main complex. The priest complains again about the smell of shoes, and he, Seji-aegi, and the servant decide to stay up all night together. The servant falls asleep, and the girl and the priest have sex. Painting of Jeseok for ritual use by shamans, possibly sixteenth century The next day, Seji-aegi finds that her lover is eating quartz. She and the servant offer him a tableful of food instead, and he rapidly devours it all. When the two take the table out of the room, they find that all of the food has reappeared, uneaten. Seji-aegi then asks him about a dream she had that night, in which three pearls fell from heaven and into her clothes. The sage informs her that she is pregnant with triplet sons, and to name them Chegungsoe, Ilgungsoe, and Saenggyeongsoe. He then vanishes without a trace. Seji-aegi is seven months pregnant when her family returns. Her mother sees her first and tells her husband that their daughter has a deadly illness for which the cure is to not see her father for three months, but her father makes his way to her room after only a month. When he realizes that she is pregnant, he decides to kill her. Seji-aegi persuades him to lock her in her room and to seal the door with iron, so that she may die while bringing the least dishonor to the family. The sage appears in the sealed room miraculously to supply her with air, water, food, and fire. Several years later, Seji-aegi's mother convinces her husband to open the door, only to discover that Seji-aegi and her three sons are all safe and sound. The father realizes that his three grandsons make no shadow, and decides to keep them in the family. When they go to school at the age of ten, they are so intelligent that the teacher suspects that they are not human children and refuses to teach them further until they can tell him their father's name. When the triplets ask their mother about their parentage, she claims that they were born when she urinated on a tree. The triplets know that she is lying and threaten to kill themselves, at which point she reveals the truth. The triplets journey to Geumgang Temple to meet their father, who gives them two tasks to verify their parentage. The first is to wash themselves with water while wearing paper clothes, and to not make any of the paper wet. The second is to build a great sand castle and run into it, and to not have a single grain of sand on their clothes. The triplets succeed in both tasks. The sage makes Seji-aegi the goddess of grain, and turns the triplets into the Jeseok gods who are in charge of fertility. He himself becomes a Buddha, ending the narrative. Interpretations The Seng-gut story may contain the greatest narrative diversity out of all known Korean shamanic narratives. It combines a number of episodes which are individually attested in Korean folklore or mythology into a single shamanic narrative. The episodes involving Seokga have clear parallels to other Korean creation narratives, especially to the Changse-ga narrative recited in 1923 by the shaman Kim Ssang-dori, who was also from Hamhung. The Gangbangdek narrative is related to the central Korean variants of the Seongju-puri narrative, in which a human carpenter builds a palace for the gods and ultimately becomes the household god Seongju, as well as a Korean folktale of a castle-building contest between a brother and a sister. The premise of the temple bell narrative‚Äîthe sacrifice of a human child to create a Buddhist temple bell‚Äîis also common in Korean folklore, most notably in the tale of the Emille Bell. The story of the rich man and his daughter-in-law is another very widespread Korean folktale and also has shamanic parallels in Sumyeong-jangja of the Cheonji-wang bon-puri of Jeju Island. Finally, the story featuring Seji-aegi is a typical northwestern Jeseok bon-puri narrative. The central figure in all episodes is referred to as the \\"sage\\" (seoin). Park Jong-seong and Lee Chang-yoon both argue that all figures referred to as the \\"sage\\" are really a single deity, so that Seokga is also Gangbangdek and the sage of Geumgang Temple. This aligns better with other mainland Korean creation narratives, in which the father of the triplets is explicitly mentioned to be Seokga. Lee Joo-young argues that it is \\"difficult\\" to accept this premise, because Seokga's death and cremation and the birth of Ching'ae-dure's son are explicitly mentioned in the text. He does note that recurrent references to Geumgang Temple make it clear that Ching'ae- dure's son is indeed the priest of the Jeseok bon-puri.

Colonies of S. olei are round, smooth, mucous and yellow. The yellow color is consistent with other Sphingobacterium species.\\"Sphingobacterium\\".

International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology. 33 (3): 580‚Äì598. doi:https://doi.org/10.1099/00207713-33-3-580  Phylogeny  The genus Sphingobacterium is characterized by the high concentrations of sphingophospholipids as lipid components. The results of phylogenetic and genome-based analyses clearly suggest that S. olei belongs to the genus Sphingobacterium and represents a novel species. According to 16S rRNA analysis and multi-locus sequence analysis (MLST), S. olei shared the highest similarity to Sphingobacterium alkalisoli (98.3 %), followed by Sphingobacterium mizutaii (95.1 %) and Sphingobacterium lactis (95.1 %). These values were below the 98.7 % threshold suggested for proposing a novel species.Bernardet, Jean-Francois; Nakagawa, Yasuyoshi; Holmes, Barry (1 May 2002). \\"Proposed minimal standards for describing new taxa of the family Flavobacteriaceae and emended description of the family\\". International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology. 52 (3): 1049‚Äì1070. doi:https://doi.org/10.1099/00207713-52-3-1049 Some features distinguished S. olei from the most closely related S. alkalisoli. For example, unlike S. alkalisoli, S. olei are positive for oxidase, catalase, and glucose fermentation activities, while negative for nitrate reduction and indole production. S. alkalisoli could tolerate higher pH and salinity than S. olei, which might be due to the fact that S. alkalisoli was isolated from saline- alkaline soil.Xu, Lian; Sun, Ji-Quan; Wang, Li-Juan; Gao, Zhi-Wei; Sun, Li- Zhu; Wu, Xiao-Lei (1 June 2017). \\"Sphingobacterium alkalisoli sp. nov., isolated from a saline-alkaline soil\\". International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology. 67 (6): 1943‚Äì1948. doi:10.1099/ijsem.0.001895  Genetics and genome  S. olei has a genome of 5.41million base pairs, which contains 4737 protein-coding genes and has a 40.6 % GC content.\\"Sphingobacterium olei strain HAL-9, whole genome shotgun sequencing project\\". NCBI. Retrieved 7 April 2020. S. olei shared 98.3 % genetic similarity to S. alkalisoli, another species under the genus Sphingobacterium, and less than 96 % similarity to other reported members of the genus Sphingobacterium. Although S. olei has similar genome size and features to other sphingobacteria, some differences could be observed. For example, S. olei has fewer genes that are putatively involved in cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments, cell wall and capsule, and phosphorus metabolism compared to S. alkalisoli. Meanwhile, more genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism, cell division and cell cycle have been putatively identified in S. olei compared to S. alkalisoli. These differences might be due to different habitats of the strains. S. alkalisoli is found in saline-alkaline soil of the same geographical region. S. olei encodes for significantly more hydrolase enzymes than other sphingobacteria. Its genome contains 146 hydrolase genes, accounting for 3 % of the total genes. Hydrolysis, a chemical reaction that hydrolases catalyze, has been shown to be a key step in herbicide degradation.  Metabolism and biochemistry  S. olei is resistant to antibiotics including chloromycetin, kanamycin, polymyxin B, streptomycin, amikacin, gentamicin, lincomycin, novobiocin and neomycin. Some key biochemical activities differ between S. olei and other strains of Sphingobacterium. S. olei assimilated capric acid and trisodium citrate, but not l-arabinose, d-mannose and d-mannitol. Oxidase activity was detected in S. olei but not in S. alkalisoli. The comparison of cellular fatty acid profiles revealed that the concentrations of iso-C15 : 0 and iso-C17 : 0 3-OH in S. olei were much lower than those in S. alkalisoli, while the concentration of summed feature 3 in S. olei was much higher than that in S. alkalisoli. In the polar lipid profiles, sphingophospholipid and two unknown phospholipids (PL1, PL2) were present in S. alkalisoli but not detected in S. olei; however, PGLs and Ls were present in S. olei but not detected in S. alkalisoli.  Ecology  S. olei, initially designated as strain HAL-9T, was first isolated from an oil-contaminated soil sample collected from farmland near an oilfield in northern China. The soil sample was contaminated by crude oil spilled from an oil well. Before being contaminated by crude oil, the farmland was planted with soybean and corn, and herbicides such as quizalofop-p-ethyl, diclofop- methyl and atrazine were applied to the farmland for weeding every year. While S. olei is incapable of degrading petroleum products associated with oilfield operations, it is found to efficiently degrade herbicides quizalofop-p-ethyl and diclofop-methyl. Approximately 95 % of quizalofop-p-ethyl and diclofop- methyl was degraded after a five-day incubation. Previous studies revealed that the initial degradation step of quizalofop-p-ethyl and diclofop-methyl was hydrolysis, and S. olei has shown to possess a large number of hydrolase genes.Nie, Zhi-Juan; Hang, Bao-Jian; Cai, Shu; Xie, Xiang-Ting; He, Jian; Li, Shun-Peng (8 June 2011). \\"Degradation of Cyhalofop-butyl (CyB) by Pseudomonas azotoformans Strain QDZ-1 and Cloning of a Novel Gene Encoding CyB-Hydrolyzing Esterase\\".

International Biodeterioration & Biodegradation. 136: 34‚Äì40. doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2018.10.008 The inability of S. olei to utilize petroleum hydrocarbons in farmland soil can be explained by its lack of alkane monooxygenase and aromatic ring-cleavage dioxygenase genes. On the other hand, the diversity of hydrolase genes in the genome of S. olei enabled the degradation of herbicides as its energy and carbon sources and thus survive in the farmland environment.

Early life and career Cullerton was born in Chicago in 1842. Cullerton's family were some of the original settlers of Chicago. Cullerton was educated in public schools. He dropped out of elementary school to work as a canalboat driver. Cullerton was a successful saloon (hotel) keeper. Political career Cullerton was a Democrat. In 1871, Cullerton was elected an alderman of the Chicago Common Council for the 7th Ward. He had been elected by a large majority. He continued to serve until 1876. Cullerton also simultaneously served as an Illinois State Senator, having been elected to that position in 1872, and assuming it in 1873. In the Illinois Senate he distinguished himself by standing as an opponent to the West Side Park Commissioners' taxation scheme, and also became well-versed in parliamentary procedure. In 1876, Cullerton was elected an alderman of what, that year, was renamed the Chicago City Council for the 6th Ward. In 1888, he was redistricted to the 9th Ward, where he served until 1892. During part of this tenure, he was Chairman of the Finance Committee. In 1898, Cullerton was again elected alderman for the 9th Ward. He served until 1900. In 1901, Cullerton was elected alderman for the 11th Ward. He served until his death in 1920. At the time of his death, having served as an alderman for a cumulative 48 years, he was the longest-serving alderman in the history of the Chicago City Council, a record he would continue to hold for many years. Cullerton died in his home on February 1, 1920 at the age of 78. Cullerton had a reputation for being screwed and for being quiet, giving birth to his nickname \\"Foxy Ed\\". He was despised by proponents of clean government, but well-liked by voters in his own ward. Legacy Cullerton Street in Chicago, previously known as 20th Street, was named for him shortly after his death. His residence, at the time of his death, had been on this street. Family political dynasty Cullerton began what has become a Cullerton family political dynasty. For a cumulative period of 112 years, at least one member of the Cullerton family sat on the Chicago City Council. A series of Cullerton's descendants would hold the aldermanship of the 38th Ward, including William J. Cullerton, Thomas W. Cullerton, and Timothy Cullerton. Also, family in-law Thomas R. Allen held this seat. P. J. \\"Parky\\" Cullerton was an ally of Richard J. Daley and served as Cook County Assessor. Patti Jo \\"P.J.\\" Cullerton, served as the 38th Ward Democratic Committeeman for over 20 years.

Apart from the Cellular Jail in the Andamans, it is the only other Indian museum which once was a jail. It is situated above sea level, away from Solan, Himachal Pradesh and maintained by the Engineering Wing of the Indian Army. The structure holds 54 maximum cells, out of which 16 cells were used for severe punishments. These cells were hardly ventilated and there was no source of any sort of natural light. The details of each cell are mentioned on title boards.  History  The military jail in Dagshai Cantonment is a witness of Mahatma Gandhi's arrival in Himachal Pradesh. Britishers used to keep rogue soldiers in here. Mahatma Gandhi spent two days here, not as a prisoner but he was here to meet the Irish prisoners. Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse was also kept in this very prison, he was believed to be the last prisoner of this jail. At most, 50 prisoners were kept here and after the independence of India it was converted into a museum. The establishment of the museum in 2011 was due to the drive of Kasauli's Brigade Commander, Brig. Ananth Narayanan. Anand Sethi, a local resident of Dagshai Hills, helped him in the curation of this museum with vintage and archival photographs and other material sourced from India, the U.K. and Ireland. Dagshai Jail museum was inaugurated by Major General SK Gadeock on 13 October 2011 for the public.  Construction and view  The Dagshai jail was constructed in the year 1849 at a cost of Rs 72,873. It has 54 maximum security cells. These cells are 8‚Äôx12‚Äô with 20-foot high ceilings. The little hamlet was founded in 1847 by the East India Company by securing 5 villages at no expense from the erstwhile Maharaja of Patiala.

Choate) was an artist, educational reformer, suffragist, philanthropist and socialite. She was one of New York City's Four Hundred and the wife of lawyer and U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Joseph Hodges Choate. As an advocate for women's education, Caroline Sterling Choate was one of the founders of the Association for Promoting the Higher Education of Women in New York in 1882. They petitioned Columbia University to admit women in 1883, but were refused on the grounds that women were not sufficiently prepared. In response, Caroline worked to establish a preparatory school for women, Brearley School, and then Barnard College for women. She was also involved in organizations for women artists, and she and her husband were instrumental in founding the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The family's estate, Naumkeag, is now a public museum and garden. Early life Caroline Dutcher Sterling, sometimes known as \\"Carrie\\", was born on June 16, 1837, in Salisbury, Connecticut. Her parents were Caroline Mary (or May) Dutcher (July 1, 1806 ‚Äì January 20, 1898) of Canaan, Connecticut and Frederick Augustine Sterling (March 18, 1796 ‚Äì January 24, 1859) of Salisbury, Connecticut. The Sterlings married on June 23, 1825, and had six children. Caroline and one of her brothers were named after their parents. The birth order of Caroline and her siblings is as follows: * Theodore Sterling (b. 1827) * Robert Sterling (b. 1829) * Frederick Augustine Sterling (b. 1831, m. Mary Emma Betts) * Edward Canfield Sterling (b. 1834) * Caroline Dutcher Sterling (b. 1837, m. Joseph H. Choate) * Alfred Elisha Sterling (b. 1843.) Caroline's father, Frederick Augustine Sterling, worked as a clerk in his father's Salisbury law office, before becoming involved in iron manufacture and lumber. In 1840, when Caroline was thirteen, the family moved to Geneva, New York for better educational opportunities. In 1849 they moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where Caroline's father owned a saw mill. During the American Civil War, Caroline's father's iron factory at Salisbury provided supplies for the Union Army. Education By 1861, Caroline Dutcher Sterling had moved to New York to live with a cousin, Mrs. Rossiter, and study art. She was \\"intending to devote herself to it as a profession for life, with great prospect of success\\" and was nicknamed \\"the Saint\\" by her friends. She wore a golden wedding band inscribed \\"wedded to art\\", a gift from her parents. Caroline Sterling Choate, 1863 At the home of artist Thomas Prichard Rossiter, Caroline met lawyer Joseph Hodges Choate. He described Caroline in one of his frequent letters as \\"very fair haired and very light complexioned,... tall and rather slightly built, has dark brown eyes... She is the most graceful of women. Her self- possession and common sense are remarkable, and she has a force of character and a strength of will which few of her sex can boast.\\" Choate later described himself as being \\"as earnestly devoted\\" to the law as Caroline was to art. However, after meeting Caroline he agreed with his friend John H. Sherwood, who had predicted that he and Caroline would \\"exactly suit\\". Choate pursued their acquaintance, and on July 4, 1861, Caroline agreed to marry him. Choate was a graduate of Harvard Law School, admitted to the bar of Massachusetts in 1855 and of New York in 1856, and in partnership with William M. Evarts and Charles F. Southmayd as of 1859. Joseph Choate had three brothers and two sisters, one of whom was also named Caroline: his sister is sometimes distinguished as Caroline Choate and his wife as Caroline Sterling Choate. Marriage On October 16, 1861, Caroline Dutcher Sterling and Joseph Hodges Choate were married by the Reverend Samuel Osgood at the All Souls Unitarian Church on 249 Fourth Avenue near 20th Street, New York. Looking back, Joseph Choate considered it \\"the most fortunate day of my life\\". Many years later, After living for some time with one of Caroline Sterling Choate's aunts, Mrs. Carr, the Choates moved into their first house, at 93 West 21st Street, in May 1863. A second-floor room was to become \\"Carrie's Studio\\" and another, adjoining, a library. New York City draft riots, 1863 A few months later, during the New York City draft riots of 1863, the Choates sheltered African Americans from attacks and lynching by white rioters. A woman with two children stayed in the Choate's basement for almost a week; her home had been looted and burned. Another of those hidden was a brother of one of the Choate's servants. When he returned to his boarding house, he found it destroyed. His elderly, crippled landlord had been beaten and lynched. Choate compared \\"the barbarity and extent of the mob\\" to the French Revolution. Joseph Choate himself witnessed the rioters' attack on Quaker abolitionist Abigail Hopper Gibbons' house. He helped her daughters Lucy and Julia to escape, and brought them home to Caroline. Their father James Sloan Gibbons joined them there. Choate wrote to his mother that \\"Carrie and the girls are very brave, and fear no danger.\\"  Rising in society  Joseph H. Choate built himself a distinguished career as a lawyer, eventually earning the description of \\"the greatest jury lawyer of his time\\". Hard-working and versatile, he became known first for his work as a jury lawyer. In his 40s, after his partner William M. Evarts became involved in government, Choate increasingly took on major roles in appellate cases before the state and Supreme Courts. Choate tried high-profile cases including the corruption trial of William M. Tweed of Tammany Hall and a repeal of income tax. Some of his cases were extremely high-paying, but he also did pro bono work, as in overturning the Court-martial of General Fitz-John Porter. The combination of birth, talent, and wealth placed Joseph Choate and his wife Caroline in positions of influence in Gilded Age society, among the Four Hundred of New York. Work Caroline Sterling Choate largely gave up her career as an artist after her marriage. A number of her paintings are displayed at the family's summer home, Naumkeag.  Arts and culture Caroline Sterling Choate redirected her strong interest in art and cultural institutions into volunteer work. She was involved with the New York School of Design for Women, which opened in 1858, preceding and becoming part of the Cooper Union. She served on the school's advisory council for nearly fifty years. Her husband acted in his capacity as a lawyer to advise or draw up articles of incorporation for institutions of interest to them both. These included the Metropolitan Museum of which Joseph H. Choate was a founder, trustee, and vice-president from 1870‚Äì1917. Caroline was involved in organizing the Society for Decorative Arts, founded in 1877 as a means of supporting unemployed women with artistic talent, many of them Civil War widows. Founder Candace Wheeler recruited to gain access to \\"all the great names in New York\\", including Caroline Choate. She was the first Vice President of the Association of Women Painters and Sculptors in New York City in 1915, and one of the vice- presidents of the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors in 1919.  Women and education  Perhaps her greatest contributions were in advocating for women's education. Caroline Sterling Choate helped to found the Association for Promoting the Higher Education of Women in New York in 1882, unsuccessfully petitioned Columbia University to admit women in 1883, and helped to found Brearley School in 1884 and Barnard College in 1889. =Association for Promoting the Higher Education of Women in New York, 1882= On January 20, 1882, a group of eight society women wrote to President Barnard of Columbia University requesting the reprinting of his speeches on the admission of women to colleges, The higher education of women. Although Caroline Choate was not one of the signers, she was highly interested in the subject. On April 22, 1882, she attended the first meeting of the Association for Promoting the Higher Education of Women in New York. Caroline Sterling Choate, Margaret Barnard, and other members of the newly formed group decided to petition Columbia University to admit women. President Barnard supported the movement. He wrote to Caroline of the importance of engaging as many voices as possible. By February 5, 1883, the petition had been signed by 1,352 people including U. S. Presidents Chester Alan Arthur and Ulysses S. Grant. Other signatories included Charles J. Folger, Noah Davis, John Forrest Dillon, Howard Crosby, Henry C. Potter, John Hall, Richard S. Storrs, Robert Collyer, Austin Flint I, William A. Hammond, Lloyd Aspinwall, Peter Cooper, Cyrus West Field, Edmund Clarence Stedman and George William Curtis. On March 5, 1883, the Columbia board rejected the petition, claiming that women lacked adequate preparation for the curriculum. The resulting public outcry moved Columbia University closer to the acceptance of women students. Although Columbia still refused to accept women as students, it was conceded that if they could pass the examinations given to men, Columbia would issue certificates recognizing their level of achievement. It was a small first step, much less than Caroline Choate and others had hoped for, but still something. President Barnard had been right when he warned Caroline Choate that changing tradition would take time. =Brearley School, 1884= Caroline's response was to address the problem. If girls were not receiving an adequate education, then their preparation must be improved. She worked with Harvard graduate Samuel A. Brearley to found the Brearley School in 1884. The school's goal was to prepare girls for Columbia. It would become one of the top-ranking schools in the United States. Caroline's daughters Mabel and Josephine, with two of her nieces, were the first students to attend Brearley. Following Samuel A. Brearley, Jr.'s early death of typhoid in 1886, the school was led by James G. Croswell, also from Harvard. =Columbia's Teachers' College, 1887= Caroline Sterling Choate was enlisted by Grace Hoadley Dodge as a trustee at Columbia's Teachers' College, along with Mrs. Josiah Macy (Caroline Louisa Everett) and Mrs. Peter M. Bryson. The college was founded in 1887. =Barnard College, 1889= Caroline Sterling Choate was also one of the founding trustees of Barnard College and served on its board from 1889 to 1930, a total of 41 years. Annie Nathan Meyer recounts that in approaching allies \\"The very first of these to be thought of was Mrs. Joseph H. Choate... Mrs. Choate not only consented at once to serve on the Board; she was willing to lend her name as its vice-chairman, a position which she most ably filled until physical disability caused her to withdraw from attendance.\\" In 1925, Annie Meyer unsuccessfully proposed naming the Students' Hall at Barnard College in honor of Mrs. Choate. On February 6, 1930, the trustees of Barnard College passed a resolution acknowledging her contributions: \\"Mrs. Choate was a very tower of strength to the young and struggling College. Her position in the community gave it prestige and created confidence in its usefulness and its stability. Her knowledge of the educational needs of New York, and her high standards of accomplishment and her energy in making friends for the College, as well as the personal generosity of herself and her husband, put Barnard College immeasurably in her debt.\\"  Woman suffrage Constitutional Convention of 1894= Though \\"the great happiness of their marriage was well known and not infrequently mentioned\\", the Choates did not always agree. Caroline was one of the \\"gilded suffragists\\", a group of New York society women who convened women's suffrage meetings in their parlors and lobbied for votes in support of women suffrage, leading up to New York state's Constitutional Convention of 1894. They assembled a petition with 600,000 signees, which was presented at the convention with a proposal to strike the word \\"male\\" from the constitution. Joseph Choate was one of the delegates to the convention and was appointed as president. To the shock of suffragists, Joseph Choate loaded the suffrage committee with anti-suffragists such as Elihu Root, and the proposed amendment for woman's suffrage failed. It was speculated that Choate's actions were an attempt to gain allies for a possible governorship.  Other voluntary work  Caroline did volunteer work and served on the board of managers of the State Charities Aid Association. The association was formed in 1872 for the improvement of conditions in prisons, hospitals, and other institutions dealing with the poor. She was counted among the patronesses of the Legal Aid Society. In 1906, the newspapers described her attending a benefit for it, a performance of H√§nsel and Gretel given by the Metropolitan Opera. In her box, Caroline wore \\"a gown of black velvet, with a bertha of Venetian point lace, wearing a tiara of diamonds.\\" She and her husband supported the New York Association for the Blind, incorporated in 1906, and Booker T. Washington's work at the Tuskegee Institute. Titanic Memorial, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney Following the disaster of the RMS Titanic in 1912, Caroline Sterling Choate helped to raise funds for the Women's Titanic Memorial Association. This resulted in the creation of the Titanic Memorial by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. Ambassadress to the Court of St. James, 1899 In 1899, Joseph Hodges Choate was appointed Ambassador to the Court of St. James in London by President William McKinley. The appointment continued under President Theodore Roosevelt. As a result, Caroline Sterling Choate was Ambassadress from 1899 to 1905. Although he was instrumental in securing a number of important diplomatic agreements, Queen Victoria considered Joseph Choate loud and lacking in manners. He attended her funeral as a special ambassador. Her successor King Edward and Queen Alexandra paid the Choates an unprecedented honor by dining with them at the American Embassy. Children Joseph and Caroline were the parents of five children, two of whom predeceased their parents: * Ruluff Sterling Choate (September 24, 1864 ‚Äì April 5, 1884) * George Choate (January 28, 1867 ‚Äì 1937) * Josephine Choate (January 9, 1869 ‚Äì July 20, 1896) * (December 26, 1870 ‚Äì 1958), who did not marry and became a traveler, gardener and philanthropist. * Joseph Hodges Choate Jr. (February 2, 1876 ‚Äì 1968), who married Cora Lyman Oliver, daughter of General Robert Shaw Oliver, in 1903. Estate Caroline Dutcher Sterling Choate and her husband Joseph Hodges Choate at their summer house, Naumkeag The family bought a forty-nine-acre country estate, known as Naumkeag in the Berkshires. The 44-room \\"cottage\\" was designed by Stanford White of McKim, Mead & White. The grounds were originally laid out by Nathan Franklin Barrett. The Choate family first occupied it in 1885. The gardens were further developed by Fletcher Steele in collaboration with Mabel Choate. The house is open to the public as a nonprofit museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Joseph Hodges Choate died on May 14, 1917, at East 63rd Street in Manhattan. He was buried in the Stockbridge Cemetery in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Caroline Sterling Choate died November 12, 1929, at her home in New York City, 8 East Sixty-third Street. The cause was given as heart disease. She was buried in Stockbridge Cemetery.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Ode to Passion holds an approval rating of 33% and an average rating of 4.80/10, based on 6 reviews. Film critic Jackie K. Cooper wrote a positive review of the film, saying \\"Jack Danini has created the best love movie of the year. Ode to Passion is quirky and original, full of love and romance. It is a musical full of lyrical cuplets between the songs.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFDA73e4lec&t;=64s Peter Debruge of Variety was also positive about the film, writing \\"Allegedly 20 years in the making, Ode to Passion is simultaneously a celebration of love at first sight and a more jaded look at the way relationships play out. It‚Äôs not as ingenious as Jason Robert Brown‚Äôs The Last Five Years, which set its core couple moving in opposite directions. But Ode is ultimately deeper and wiser than its instant-infatuation opening suggests. Embrace the cheese and writer-director Jack Danini‚Äôs indie rock musical ‚Äî set in New York and written entirely in verse ‚Äî just might win you over.\\" Taryn Smith of Picture This Post praised the cinematography, saying that it \\"helps bring all the scenes to life by showing us the many sides of the city‚Äîfrom the colorful, fun night life to the dingy subway. The sweeping motions of the camera also serve to heighten our response. We are as dizzy, caught up and intoxicated by Sarah and Michael‚Äôs new love as they are. We also are dragged to the lowest of lows in scenes with stark lighting contrasts as their relationship suffers its many downs.\\" Alan Ng of Film Threat was mixed about the film, saying \\"There is just as much right going for the film as there is wrong and, sadly, Ode to Passion falls short of being something special. Jack Danini, though, has the makings of becoming a great director and also has a good sense of story, which is vital to directing.\\" ReferencesExternal links  Category:2020 directorial debut films Category:2020 drama films Category:2020 films Category:2020 independent films Category:2020s musical drama films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American musical drama films Category:Films about addiction Category:Films not released in theaters due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in New York City ","title":"Ode to Passion"},{"id":"64340236","text":"O Jong-yeol (born 2 October 1961) is a South Korean sailor.

In various sources, the name may be found spelled as Te‚Äôumman, Teumann, or Te- Umman. For a time, \\"many scholars, beginning with G.G. Cameron,\\" believed him to have been the Tepti-Huban-Inshushinak mentioned in inscriptions, although this view has since fallen from favor. Succession Teumman succeeded Urtak. The relationship between Urtak and Teumman is a matter of disagreement. On the one hand, D. T. Potts (2015) refers to Teumann as \\"apparently unrelated to either Urtak or Hubanhaltash II.\\" Likewise, Boederman's Cambridge Ancient History refers to the accession of Teumman as a \\"dynastic upset.\\" On the other hand, M. Rahim Shayegan claims that \\"Te'umman seems to have been the brother of two of his royal predecessors (Huban-Halta≈° II and Urtak).\\" In any event, upon the accession of Teumman, Urtak's sons escaped to Assyria, after which Urtak unsuccessfully demanded that Assyria return Urtak's sons to his custody. Battle of Ulai (653 BCE) Ashurbanipal launched a devastating attack on Elam in 653. A text, written in 649, among the annals of Ashurbanipal, records Ashurbanipal's justifications for the war and its conclusion. Ashurbanipal's reasons for the war included \\"Teumman's insolent messages, his boasting, his evil plots, a lunar eclipse that foretold Teumman's downfall, a seizure inflicted on Teumman by the gods as a warning, and Teumman's declaration of war on Asshurbanipal.\\" The text records that at the Battle of Ulai (653 BCE) Tammaritu defended his wounded father during the battle, but thta he was ultimately beheaded together with his father.

After few years of partition this area came to be known as Gahi Mammar, named after Mammar people who used to live here prior to partition of subcontinent.  Educational institutions  *Govt. high school for boys *Govt. high school for girls *Jinnah Public School and College *Allama Iqbal College Business Centers This area was totally agricultural before 2000 but since then it has gain business popularity in a short time. Now it is one of the business platforms for the businessmen. Now it is mostly commercial area. The main cause of its popularity is that this town is situated at the junction of Kahror Pakka and Mailsi, town is located on the roads which connects two cities and is used for transportation of goods. It also connects 4 main cities Kahror Pakka, Dunyapur, Mailsi and Dokota. So it is center of these great cities.

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the event marked his first public campaign event since March 2020. Critics and health officials warned that as a large public gathering in a confined indoor space, there was a high probability that new COVID-19 infections could occur at the event due to the lack of social distancing, amidst a recent spike in cases in Oklahoma; attendees were required to not hold the Trump campaign responsible for any COVID-19 exposure at the event. The original scheduling of the rally on June 19 was considered insensitive due to the Black Lives Matter movement, as it is a day of celebration honoring the emancipation of African Americans, and Tulsa was the site of a race massacre in 1921. Citing these concerns, the Trump campaign later delayed the rally to June 20. The rally attracted a smaller audience than projected by the Trump campaign, with an estimate of 6,200 by Tulsa's fire department‚Äîin comparison to the arena's capacity of around 19,000. An outdoor overflow stage (where Trump and Vice President Mike Pence were also to make appearances) was scrapped due to the lack of turnout. President Trump and other campaign officials alleged that disruptions by \\"radical\\" protesters and negative coverage of the rally by news outlets had deterred attendance, although the former claim was disputed by CNN reporters on-scene. At least eight positive cases of COVID-19 have been reported among campaign staff who worked the rally, with six of them reported prior to the event. Following the rally, Trump faced criticism for stating in his speech that he had asked the federal government to \\"slow down\\" COVID-19 testing, in order to reduce the number of new U.S. cases. Trump and his staff claimed that the remark was meant to be \\"tongue-in-cheek\\", while Trump stated in a June 22 interview that he \\"does not kid\\" and that he discussed it with officials but did not outright order the government to do so. Trump's claim that he ordered a slowdown in testing was contradicted in sworn testimony by the federal health officials in charge of coronavirus response.  Background and preparations  Exterior of the BOK Center, 2008 On June 10, President Donald Trump announced his intent to host a rally for his 2020 re-election campaign at the BOK Center in Tulsa on June 19, in his first public campaign event since the wider activation of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in March 2020. Concerns were raised that as a large, public gathering held in a confined, indoor space, the rally could exacerbate spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Trump stated that Oklahoma had done \\"a great job with COVID\\" (despite there having been a recent uptick in cases), while Mayor of Tulsa G. T. Bynum stated that \\"Tulsans have managed one of the first successful re-openings in the nation, so we can only guess that may be the reason President Trump selected Tulsa as a rally site\\", but added that the campaign was being encouraged to provide \\"enhanced hygiene considerations\\" to comply with state guidelines. Oklahoma has recommended avoiding crowded gatherings, but does not currently enforce limits on their size. The Washington Post cited the rally as part of a growing de-emphasis of the pandemic by the Trump administration. Trump's campaign director Tim Murtaugh told Fox News that there were plans for safety protocols, but that \\"I would point out to the national media that I don't remember them doing any social distancing shaming when they were doing all the coverage of the [George Floyd] demonstrations that were going on.\\" Attendees were required to accept a liability waiver, agreeing to not hold the Trump campaign liable for any exposure to COVID-19 that may occur at the rally, citing it as an inherent risk in any public gathering at this time. Trump's former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci felt that the waiver was an example of \\"two of the great hallmarks of his presidency: Selfish and irresponsible.\\" The campaign later announced plans to perform temperature checks, and to offer face masks and hand sanitizer to all attendees. Amidst increased support for the Black Lives Matter movement following the killing of George Floyd, the site and scheduling of the rally also faced criticism; Tulsa's Greenwood district was the site of a major race massacre in 1921, while the rally fell on \\"Juneteenth\\"‚Äîa holiday celebrating the emancipation of enslaved African Americans. Trump's history of racially-charged statements was also noted. On June 13, Trump announced that the rally would be pushed back by one day to June 20. He later attempted to take credit for having made Juneteenth \\"very famous\\", claiming that \\"nobody had ever heard of [it]\\" before.Maegan Vazquez, Trump claims he deserves credit for making Juneteenth 'very famous' , CNN (June 18, 2020).Michael C. Bender, Trump Talks Juneteenth, John Bolton, Economy in WSJ Interview , Wall Street Journal (June 19, 2020). The campaign also announced plans for overflow capacity at the nearby Cox Business Convention Center. On June 14, Oklahoma announced its largest single-day increase in cases, at 225. Tulsa County also reported its largest single-day increase since March. On June 18, after initially experiencing technical difficulties preventing the release of COVID-19 totals in the state, the Oklahoma State Department of Health reported that Oklahoma had reached 9,354 cases, an increase of 450, which broke the previous record day-to-day case increase of 259. On June 15, Vice President Mike Pence and Governor Stitt announced that they would also attend the rally, with Stitt to introduce Trump. Pence stated that the campaign chose to host the event in Oklahoma because they had flattened the curve \\"in a very real sense\\", claiming that \\"their hospital capacity is abundant, [and] the number of cases in Oklahoma has declined precipitously\\", despite Oklahoma (and several other states where the campaign planned to hold rallies) having seen a recent spike in new cases since they began lifting restrictions and quarantine measures. Trump disembarking Air Force One at Tulsa International Airport en route to the rally In a Q&A;, Governor Stitt stated that he was exploring a switch to an outdoor venue, but that the event was currently planned to go on at BOK Center as scheduled, and that it was up to individuals (unless immunocompromised) to choose whether they want to attend because they live in a \\"free society\\", but that \\"we have to learn how to deal with this.\\" Mayor Bynum stated that he would not use his emergency powers to stop the rally. The city's health director Bruce Dart told the Tulsa World that \\"I think it's an honor for Tulsa to have a sitting president want to come and visit our community, but not during a pandemic. I‚Äôm concerned about our ability to protect anyone who attends a large, indoor event, and I‚Äôm also concerned about our ability to ensure the president stays safe as well.\\" On June 18, by request of the chief of police, a curfew was implemented around the site of BOK Center, citing that \\"individuals from organized groups who have been involved in destructive and violent behavior in other States are planning to travel to the City of Tulsa for purposes of causing unrest in and around the rally.\\" The next day, Mayor Bynum announced that he had rescinded the curfew, stating that it was \\"no longer necessary\\". A lawsuit was filed against BOK Center's management on behalf of businesses and immunocompromised plaintiffs, seeking that it enforce \\"government mandated social distancing protocols, including the required wearing of masks and reducing attendance so that at least six feet separates each rally-goer while in the arena.\\" On June 19, the Oklahoma Supreme Court rejected the suit. On the day of the rally, six Trump campaign staff members working the rally were tested positive for COVID-19. The Trump campaign paid more than $2.2 million to hold the rally.  Speech  Trump spoke for 1 hour and 41 minutes; he opened by praising the audience as \\"warriors\\" and criticized coverage of the event he perceived as negative. Trump's speech was replete with false claims, including many falsehoods he had uttered on previous occasions.Daniel Dale, Tara Subramaniam, David Wright & Holmes Lybrand, Fact check: Trump's Tulsa rally littered with familiar false claims , CNN (June 21, 2020). Trump said that Coronavirus disease 2019 had \\"19 different names\\", including \\"kung flu\\", and that calling it COVID-19 \\"gets further and further away from China as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus.‚Äù Trump praised the country's response to the pandemic, and stated that he had asked officials to \\"slow the testing down\\", so the country's case numbers would not be high. One-eighth of Trump's speech was devoted to complaining about media coverage of his appearance of the commencement ceremony at the United States Military Academy;Philip Bump, Trump spent one of every eight minutes in Tulsa complaining about coverage of his West Point speech , Washington Post (June 20, 2020). Trump asserted that he walked down a stage ramp at West Point slowly because his leather-bottomed shoes were slippery. Trump also repeated false claims regarding his predecessor, Barack Obama; his 2020 opponent, Joe Biden, and Democrats; falsely claimed credit for establishing the VA Choice program (which was actually established by legislation sponsored by John McCain and Bernie Sanders and signed into law by Obama); and exaggerated the scope of the coronavirus-related travel restrictions imposed by his administration. During the speech, Trump criticized recent calls for the removal of Confederate monuments and contended that \\"the unhinged left-wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrating our monuments, our beautiful monuments, tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control, we're not conforming.\\" He praised his Supreme Court appointees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, alleging that Biden would install \\"extremists\\" if elected. Attendance and viewership The total attendance of the rally would be lower than was expected by the Trump campaign; roughly a week prior, Trump claimed that \\"almost one million\\" people had requested tickets. An outdoor overflow stage (which was also scheduled to have in-person appearances by Trump and Pence following the in-arena address) was scrapped just hours before the rally, while Tulsa's fire department and Trump's campaign each reported crowd estimates of 6,200 and 12,000, respectively ‚Äî less than the arena's capacity of around 19,000. It was reported that TikTok users and members of K-pop fandoms had credited themselves with falsely requesting tickets for the rally, as part of a coordinated effort to \\"troll\\" Trump; earlier, Mary Jo Laupp (who had worked for Pete Buttigieg's campaign for Democratic candidacy in the 2020 presidential election) uploaded a video on TikTok which encouraged viewers to request the Trump camp a ticket and not show up. CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC all carried coverage of the rally, with Fox News being the only one among the three to carry Trump's address live. Fox News recorded an average of 7.7 million viewers that night (peaking at 8.2 near the 9:00 p.m. EDT hour), which it stated was its highest Saturday primetime viewership in network history.  Aftermath =Coronavirus impacts Shortly before the rally, Trump campaign staffers, at the direction of the campaign, removed \\"Do Not Sit Here, Please!\\" stickers from arena seats; the stickers were intended to ensure social distancing between rally attendees. The removal of the stickers contradicted instructions from arena management. Few attendees at the rally practiced social distancing or wore face masks. Following the rally, two additional Trump campaign staffers, two Secret Service agents, Oklahoma Watch reporter Paul Monies (a journalist who attended the rally) and Herman Cain (who also attended the rally and tested negative for the virus immediately before entering the rally); tested positive for COVID-19. Cain tested positive on June 29, was hospitalized on July 1, and died from complications of the virus on July 30, 2020. After two Secret Service agents who were at the rally tested positive, dozens of agents were asked to self-isolate; the Secret Service did not say how many of its employees were infected or isolating. On July 3, Trump campaign official Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr., tested positive for COVID-19. She had attended the Tulsa rally and Trump's rally in Phoenix, Arizona on June 23, and then traveled to South Dakota intending to attend a Trump-related fireworks celebration at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. Since she was diagnosed as infected earlier on the day of the South Dakota event, she did not attend it. In the 30 day period after the rally the rate of new COVID-19 cases in Oklahoma more than tripled, to 513 cases per day. Trump and Trump administration reactions Trump was reportedly \\"furious\\" over the low attendance of the rally; campaign manager Brad Parscale argued that \\"a week's worth of the fake news media warning people away from the rally because of COVID and protesters\\" had deterred attendance, while Murtaugh accused \\"radical protesters, coupled with a relentless onslaught from the media\\", of attempting to \\"frighten\\" Trump's supporters. On Fox News Sunday the following morning, campaign advisor Mercedes Schlapp similarly accused protesters of having \\"blocked the paths\\" to the venue to deter attendance. However, besides a group of anti-Trump protesters near a security checkpoint, as well as one of the venue entrances being temporarily closed after an attempt to block it, CNN reporters on-scene observed relatively few disruptions. It was also reported that Trump had criticized the decision to publicize positive cases among his staff prior to the rally. Trump advisor Peter Navarro claimed that Trump's \\"slow the testing down\\" remark was meant to be tongue-in-cheek. When asked about the remarks by a reporter on June 22, Trump replied \\"I don't kid, let me just tell you.\\" In an interview with CBN News aired later that evening, Trump denied that he had directly ordered his administration to reduce testing (calling his remark in the speech \\"semi tongue-in-cheek\\"). Trump added, however, that he did suggest to \\"[his] people\\" that doing fewer tests would make the United States look like it was \\"doing much better\\", but that \\"I wouldn't do that, but I will say this: we do so much more [testing] than other countries it makes us, in a way, look bad but actually we're doing the right thing.\\"  See also  * 2020 Salute to America * South Dakota's Mount Rushmore Fireworks Celebration 2020 * White House COVID-19 outbreak References External links  * President Trump Campaign Rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma at c-span.org Category:2020 in Oklahoma Category:Controversies of the 2020 United States presidential election Tulsa rally Category:History of Tulsa, Oklahoma Category:June 2020 events in the United States Tulsa rally Category:Republican Party (United States) events in Oklahoma Tulsa rally Tulsa rally ","title":"2020 Trump Tulsa rally"},{"id":"64340383","text":"The inland broad-blazed slider (Lerista nichollsi) is a species of skink found in Western Australia.

Field stripping is firearms terminology for the act of disassembling a firearm to the greatest possible extent without the usage of any extra tools. A disassembly that uses such tools is called a detail strip, but this is less common than a field strip, as these are usually sufficient. = Definition = Field strips are done to facilitate cleaning, or identify damages. It is customary for soldiers to be taught how to conduct a field strip, both as a means of discipline, and to help create a sense of familiarity with the weapon. Because it is an integral part of owning and using a firearm, especially in a military context, firearm manufacturers will take considerations to make field strips expedient and simple. In one instance, the Los Angeles Police Department opted against the purchase of Thompson submachine guns primarily because other available weapons were easier to field strip.A fully assembled SKS. The receiver cover is in the way of the recoil spring, preventing it from being cleaned.  Rationale  When fully assembled, a gun is not very suitable for cleaning, and like any machine, will need to be frequently cleaned and maintained in order to stay in optimal condition. Very few of its parts can be accessed unless it has been field stripped, and most of those parts can only be partially seen. Instead, when field stripped, it can be inspected or cleaned more thoroughly, as individual parts can be separated. A field strip may also reveal issues that otherwise can't be seen, such as cracks or deformities, but excessive cleaning may further induce wear on the weapon.

In Pakistan, the code of conduct and ordinance act comprises a set of rules for publishing, distributing and circulating news stories and operating media organizations working independently or running in the country. The law of Pakistan (in media) maintains a hybrid legal system for independent journalism, while it prohibits media bias or misleading information under the certain constitutional amendments as described by the country's constitution. The media crime which is described by the country's criminal codes is recognized one of the unlawful act. Nevertheless, freedom of the press in Pakistan is subject to certain restrictions, such as defamation law, a lack of protection for whistleblowers, barriers to information access and constraints caused by public and government hostility to journalists. The press, including print, television, radio, and internet are amended to express their concerns under the selected provisions such as PEMRA Ordinance 2002, Defamation Ordinance 2002, Broadcasting Corporation Act, 1973 and Code of Conduct for Media Broadcasters/Cable TV Operators. The Protection of Journalists Act, 2014 allows a journalist or media industries to cover any story and brought it to the audiences without impacting national security of the country. To protect the intellectual, moral, and fundamental rights of the citizens, the government has taken several countermeasures to combat circulating junk news and restricting objectionable contents across the multiple platforms. The law of Pakistan prohibits spreading or publishing fake news through social or mass media, and could lead to imprisonment of a journalist or newspaper ban.  Global ranking  In 2020, Pakistan's press freedom rank dropped to 145 out of 180 countries in Press Freedom Index, an annual ranking of countries published by Reporters Without Borders (RWB), an international non-governmental organization dedicated to safeguard the right to freedom of information. In 2019, the country's press freedom rank was recorded 142 in Press Freedom Index, making it a slight decline than in previous annual report. The Pakistan's global index rank was declined for several issues such as killings of journalists, restrictions imposed on news media, withdrawal of government ads threats, harassment, violation of independent journalism, detention, abduction, and frivolous lawsuits against journalists. Targeting victims such as physical abuse against journalists and prejudice is one of the other reasons for the decline in the world ranking index. The annual report stated declination of rank for several unlawful reasons such as written and verbal threats of murder, offline and online harassment. The report argued self- censorship in the country.  Reactions  The prime minister of Pakistan in his speech during a visit to the United States criticised the report published by the Reporters Without Borders citing \\"curbs on press freedom in Pakistan was a joke\\". His remarks on global annual report was subsequently criticised by the RWB.  Censorship on press  The government of Pakistan is often argued for carrying self-censorship and detentions of the journalists under a single-issue politics. Sometimes, only news that favours the regime is published by the local media, whilst news that covers the economic and political problems in the country, or criticisms of the regime faces threatened warnings from the state. The print and broadcasting media claims carrying stories under the political pressure since Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), a major political party in Pakistan came into power. The Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors, a nonprofit organization of Pakistan dedicated to safeguards of journalists and media outlets argued Pakistan's direct and self- censorship and state-sponsored hostility towards independent journalists working in the country. In the recent years (around 2018 or 2019), seven journalists were killed while fifteen others were injured in different violences. In Pakistan, sixty journalists were allegedly charged under Anti- Terrorism Act. The government, however, cited the issue with the country's law and order. In 2019 or earlier, the administration, first time in the history of Pakistan temporarily banned a journalist for possessing the material unlawfully. The federal government-owned agency Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA), responsible for regulating and issuing channel licenses for establishment of the mass, print and electronic media, restricted some news presenters from participating in debates on Talk shows, and later the restrictions were lifted after sixty days. In 2019, the government suspended news TV channels, including Channel 24, Abb Takk News, and Capital TV for broadcasting opposition party's program on their channels. The Reporters Without Borders criticised the action citing \\"brazen censorship\\". The government, however, suspended under a set of new laws for media regulator in an attempt to restrict press conference by a convicted or on-trial politicians.  Cult of personality  The media have consistently upheld the personality cult of the leaders since the country's formation. The journalists in the country have experienced troubles during the military dictatorship, the PTI government led by Imran Khan, however, partially restored independent journalism. Sometimes, Imran Khan's government is argued for direct censorship following the Balochistan conflict. In 2011, the tenth and the former president of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf is often claimed for expanding independent journalism in the country. He is also argued for banning the television news channels during 2007 Pakistani state of emergency.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1992. p. 30 Vegetarianism Kress was originally a vegan and believed that butter, eggs, meat and milk should be avoided. He argued that plants contained \\"all the elements needed for the human body\\". Kress visited New Zealand in 1901. He worked at the Christchurch Medical and Surgical Sanitarium. He lectured at the Christchurch Art Gallery on food reform, condemning alcohol and meat consumption. Kress was a teetotaller who believed that animal flesh \\"created a craving for alcoholic drink\\". Kress suffered from pernicious anemia and was expected to die in 1901.Kress, Daniel H.

His wife arranged for him to be buried at Avondale College cemetery. However, he received a letter from Ellen G. White which advised he be given fresh-beaten eggs in grape juice, as \\"this will supply that which is necessary for your system\\". He followed the counsel given and slowly recovered. His health had deteriorated from an unbalanced vegan diet. He became a vegetarian, adding dairy and eggs to his diet. He fully recovered and lived another 55 years. Kress made other trips to New Zealand. In 1905, he lectured in Gisborne on dieting and longevity. He promoted a Biblical diet of fruit, grains, nuts and seeds as the original diet of mankind. Kress condemned tobacco smoking as a cause of cancer and a \\"crime to the community, as it poisons the air\\". Kress opposed the consumption of mustard, peppers, pickles and spices as they created a thirst for alcohol and were \\"not designed to be fed into the human body\\". In 1909, Kress and his wife authored the Good Health Cookery Book which contains meatless recipes based around cereals, fruits and vegetables. The Kresses advised two meals a day and suggested nutmeat or protose (a mixture of nuts and gluten) as substitutes for meat.

Background The shooting took place at an after party, illegal under COVID-19 lockdown rules. In other illegal raves in Greater Manchester shortly before the incident, a man had died of a suspected overdose and a woman was raped. The police say there are many considerations when it comes to shutting down or letting raves continue. The after party was an unplanned event that followed a Black Lives Matter barbecue that had been earlier held nearby, but was unconnected to this prior event, which peacefully finished at 20:00. Incident During a night time street party in a car park in Moss Side at the junction of Caythorpe Street, Broadfield Road, and Bowes Street a man opened fire on those attending at about 00:30 BST, causing them to run screaming from the area. Gunshot was reported at a location on Caythorpe Street, with armed police responding to the scene at 01:00. They discovered a party attended by hundreds of people, in violation of COVID-19 lockdown guidelines in the country at the time. The police report that a \\"community event\\" had taken place in the area earlier in the day, and the party had been an unplanned after party but still had a DJ. A local resident said the party had begun at around 22:00 the night before, and that Moss Side was a peaceful neighbourhood with infrequent spikes of violent activity. Casualties The two fatally wounded men self-presented at an Accident and Emergency department, either shortly before 01:00 (according to the police) or at about 01:30 (according to the Manchester Evening News), dying later. Initially one death, of a man aged 36, was reported before the other man, aged 21, also died. Investigation A murder investigation was opened the same day. On 26 June 2020, a 32-year-old Birmingham woman was arrested on suspicion of the murder of the two men.

The duo was made up of Gerardo Parker as composer and vocalist, and Daniel Rucks, as writer and vocalist. Rucks Parker duo is recognized for songs like \\"Como Quisiera Que No Existieras\\", \\"Suena Como Mozart\\", \\"3/4 de Nada\\", \\"Mi Bestia Interior\\" and \\"Por D√≥nde Sale el Sol\\".  History  Rucks Parker was formed in February 1992, when Gerardo Parker once invited Daniel Rucks to his newly opened studio to test its quality. Rucks and Parker already knew each other at the time, having previously worked together recording jingles for products Parker represented. Although Daniel Rucks, who only composed songs, insisted to Parker that only he will sing; finally both put their voices. They recorded around 4 hours, obtaining, as a result, their first song: \\"Mermelada de Tristeza\\". Later, they inserted this song on the country's radio stations, quickly becoming their first song recognized nationally. Consequently that same year they began the recording of what would be their first album, Bienvenidos a Mi Circo. This album would catapult them to success, releasing songs like \\"3/4 de nada\\", \\"Telara√±as en la Mente\\", \\"Mermelada de Tristeza\\", \\"Me Llega M√°s Tu Mam√°\\" y \\"Mi Bestia Interior\\". The song \\"Yo creo en El Salvador\\" is considered patriotic for the content of its lyrics, and gained radio rotation after January 2001 earthquakes. In 1993, they released their second album Clorofila, which has recognized songs as \\"Suena Como Mozart\\". In 1994, they released Una Madrugada del Siglo XX, considered the duo's most complex and best-produced album. \\"Como Quisiera Que No Existieras\\" is one of the most recognized songs of the duo. In 1996, they released their fourth and last studio album, which is titled Cr√≥nicas de Nomeacuerdo, which contains \\"Por D√≥nde Sale El Sol\\" and \\"La M√°quina de Hacer P√°jaros\\". In 1997, the duo announced their indefinite separation, although they continued to hold occasional concerts in subsequent years. In 2006 they announced the publication of non-released material: \\"Si En Verdad Me Quieres, Pr√©stame Un D√≥lar\\", \\"Asesin√© a Mi Novia\\", \\"Mi Segunda Oportunidad\\" and \\"A√∫n peor si pienso\\". In 2009 they released their first compilation album, Jazz Tubo, which compiles their greatest hits and material released in 2006.

Opened in 1895, it operated until 1970, after which it was abandoned.  Construction  The sephamore tower is located in Anaga, on the north of Tenerife. This part of the island has a good view of ships arriving from Europe, whether friendly or otherwise, as well as being able to monitor the weather conditions for ships passing through the area. The first watchmen in the area were appointed by the Cabildo de Tenerife on 17 April 1506, who initially communicated via smoke and fire signals. Over the years, they warned of attacks by the British, Dutch, French, Berber and Americans. With the invention of telegraphy, watchtowers were revolutionised. Anaga was one of the twenty semaphores designated by Spanish royal decree on 9 June 1884. It is located on a cliff over above sea level. The building was constructed by the Ministry of Public Works, with funding from Hamilton & Co. The electric semaphore was received by the Ministry of the Navy in 1893. It began operation on 4 December 1895 and entered service on 20 November 1886, before being handed over to the Spanish government in December 1886. It communicated with the Navy Command about away, which had a matching observatory tower and signal pole. The semaphore was visited by Pascual Cervera y Topete in 1898.  Operation  The main building is rectangular, with two attached houses for watchers, as well as other rooms including a kitchen and toilet. An attached rectangular building provided additional housing, with a third, hexagonal, building for an observatory. Two cisterns provided water, and there was an exterior bread oven. The building was modified several times while operating, with materials delivered by camel. The mast was tall, with a twelve-point crosshead for signal flags, and a lightning rod at the top. The mast was used to convey information about incoming ships, such as their nationality and type, using flags.  Current status  The semaphore was handed over to the Hacienda on 2 July 1970, to be maintained as part of the state's heritage, after its operation became unnecessary due to advances in maritime communications. It ceased operations in 1971, and the building was subsequently abandoned in 1979. It is without legal protection, but was added to the heritage red list on 26 November 2015. The building has significantly delayed, with the loss of doors, windows, interior walls, the cisterns, and the decay of the roof and its facade. The signal mast has split, and several fires have happened inside the building. The roof collapsed in 2012. There is no road to the semaphore: access is only by the PR-TF 5.1 path, which starts from the Igueste church, and covers with a steep incline. In 2018, the 123rd birthday of the semaphore was celebrated by flares lit at the site, and an optical signal from the Tenerife Naval Command.

He won two minor events as a juvenile and a handicap race on his three-year-old debut before emerging as a top-class performer with victories in the St James's Palace Stakes and Prix Jacques Le Marois Background Palace Pier is a bay colt with a white star bred in England by the Highclere Stud & Floors Farming. As a yearling in October 2018 he was put up for auction at Tattersalls and bought for 600,000 guineas by the trainer John Gosden. He entered the ownership of Godolphin but was before his racing career began he was transferred to the ownership of Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum. He was from the second crop of foals sired by Kingman who was named Cartier Horse of the Year in 2014 when he won the Irish 2,000 Guineas, St James's Palace Stakes, Sussex Stakes and Prix Jacques Le Marois. Palace Pier's dam Beach Frolic was an unraced half-sister to Bonfire (Dante Stakes) and Joviality (Windsor Forest Stakes). She was a great-granddaughter of the French broodmare Miss Satin (foaled 1975) whose other descendants have included Blue Bunting and Miss Satamixa (Prix Jacques Le Marois). Racing career=2019: two-year-old season Frankie Dettori rode Palace Pier on both of his races in 2019. The colt began his track career in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Sandown Park on 30 August when he started the 11/8 favourite and won by three and three quarter lengths after taking the lead a furlong from the finish and drawing away from his opponents in the closing stages. On 18 September, over the same course and distance, the colt started at odds of 1/8 for a novice race (for horses with no more than two previous wins) in which he led from the start and won by four and a half lengths from Mars Landing despite being eased down in the final furlong. 2020: three-year-old season The flat racing season in England was disrupted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Palace Pier did not make his reappearance until 6 June when he carried top weight of 131 pounds in a handicap race over one mile on the synthetic Tapeta at Newcastle Racecourse. Ridden by Robert Havlin he started the 11/10 favourite and won in \\"impressive\\" style by three lengths after coming from well off the pace to take the lead inside the final furlong. Two weeks after his win at Newcastle the colt was stepped up sharply in class to contest the Group 1 St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot in which he was partnered by Dettori and started at odds of 4/1. Pinatubo started favourite while the other five runners included Wichita (second in the 2000 Guineas), Positive (Solario Stakes), Threat (Gimcrack Stakes), Arizona (Coventry Stakes) and Royal Dornoch (Royal Lodge Stakes). After starting slowly and racing towards the rear of the field Palace Pier began to make progress on the final turn, moved into contention a furlong out, and overtook Pinatubo in the closing stages to win \\"readily\\" by a length. After the race John Gosden said \\"The race panned out well. Frankie said he wanted to ride him a little cold and settle him... It was no fluke, he is a very talented horse... It's a stiff old mile at Ascot and he showed his stamina\\" before indicating that the colt would be aimed at the Prix Jacques Le Marois. Dettori, who was winning his 73rd race at Royal Ascot commented \\"It was hard to really get him fit, but John thought let's start him in a handicap which should wake him up, and it did... We always thought a lot of Palace Pier but his work in the spring wasn't what we thought it could've been, but since Newcastle he's turned a page. I expect him to improve\\".

It served in the final stages of the Tunisian Campaign and throughout the Italian Campaign. It reformed in the Territorial Army in the 1950s to command air defence units. Background The need for a higher organisational command structure for medium and heavy artillery became apparent during the Battle of France and the early part of the Western Desert Campaign. The 'Army Group Royal Artillery' (AGRA) concept was developed during Exercise 'Bumper' held in the UK in 1941, organised by the commander of Home Forces, General Alan Brooke (himself a Gunner) with Lt-Gen Bernard Montgomery as chief umpire.Bryant, pp. 256‚Äì8.Doherty, p. 35. This large anti-invasion exercise tested many of the tactical concepts that would be used by the British Army in the latter stages of the war. The gunnery tacticians developed the AGRAs as powerful artillery brigades, usually comprising three medium regiments and one heavy regiment, which could be rapidly moved about the battlefield, and had the punch to destroy enemy artillery with counter-battery (CB) fire. AGRAs were provided to field armies at a scale of about one per Army corps.Buckley, p. 41 & fn 60, p. 309.Ellis, Normandy, Appendix IV.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 99. AGRAs were improvised until 26 November 1942, when they were officially sanctioned, to consist of a commander (CAGRA) and staff to control non- divisional artillery.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, p. 273.Molony, Vol V, p. 451. World War II First Army's formation badge, adopted by 2nd AGRA. The Headquarters (HQ) of 2nd AGRA was formed at the Scotch Corner Hotel, Darlington, on 24 August 1942 from elements of Headquarters RA, First Army.Frederick, p. 965.Royal Artillery Formation Badges at British & Commonwealth Badge Forum. It was assigned to First Army for the landings in North Africa (Operation Torch), and first went into action in March 1943, supporting IX Corps in Tunisia. It was with V Corps by the end of the campaign in May 1943, and then prepared for the Allied invasion of Italy.2 AGRA at RA 1939‚Äì45. 99 Battery of 74th Medium Regiment struggles to bring a 5.5-inch gun into action during the winter fighting at Monte Camino. A 3.7-inch HAA gun firing in the ground support role in Italy. The make-up of an AGRA during the Italian Campaign was extremely flexible: it could include army field regiments (25-pounders), medium regiments (4.5-inch or 5.5-inch guns) and heavy regiments (7.2-inch howitzers). It might also be augmented with 3.7-inch heavy anti-aircraft (HAA) guns loaned by the AA brigades for additional ground support fire. 2nd AGRA landed at Salerno in Italy with X Corps soon after the assault landings (Operation Avalanche) on 9 September 1943. 12th AA Brigade was responsible for the AA defence of the beachhead, and its HAA guns had also been firing in support of the infantry divisions during the first few days before 2nd AGRA arrived. When the break-out from the beachhead got under way on 18 September, 12th AA Bde provided a Light AA battery to protect 2nd AGRA's medium gun areas around Mango. 2nd AGRA then supported X Corps in its advance to Naples and the crossing of the River Volturno. In the advance beyond the Voluturno it was reinforced by 214 (Southsea) Battery from 57th (Wessex) HAA Regiment, to fire in the medium role and the followed the advance in the HAA role.Routledge, pp. 271‚Äì4, 283.Brig Mortimer Wheeler, '12 AA Brigade, Report on Operations 1 May 43 to 1 Nov 43: The Salerno Landings and the Advance to the Volturno', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 204/7254. Scammell Pioneer tractor towing a 7.2-inch howitzer of 56th Heavy Regiment round a tight corner in Italy, 23 December 1943. The utility of the 3.7-inch gun for medium artillery work, and the declining threat from the Luftwaffe, meant that HAA units were increasingly used in the ground fire role. Despite the confusion in titles, 2nd AA Brigade actually operated as '2nd AGRA (AA)' in the later stages of the campaign.'The History of HQ 12 AA Brigade 1939‚Äì1945', TNA file WO 204/7254. In December 1943 2nd AGRA fired in support of 201st Guards Brigade's attack up 'Bare Arse Ridge' on 6 November during the during the Battle of Monte Camino, with the following line-up of guns: * 23rd Field Regiment * 146th (Pembroke & Cardiganshire) Field Regiment * 74th Medium Regiment * 56th Heavy Regiment A 5.5-inch crew awaiting the order to fire on the Garigliano, January 1944.

Molony, Vol V, p. 697. By late May, 2nd AGRA was supporting X Corps' advance after Operation Diadem had broken through the German Winter Line, and in the subsequent pursuit to Lake Trasimeno and advance to Florence, with the following order of battle:Molony, Vol VI, Pt I, pp. 247‚Äì8.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 1‚Äì5, 76. 5.5-inch gun of 102nd (Pembroke Yeomanry) Medium Regiment, March 1944. * 5th Medium Regiment * 74th Medium Regiment * 102nd (Pembroke Yeomanry) Medium Regiment * 140th (5th London) Medium Regiment * 56th Heavy Regiment * One battery, 32nd Heavy Regiment It continued with X Corps during Operation Olive to breach the Gothic Line in August, Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, p. 225. and was with II Polish Corps in October. For the Allied Spring 1945 offensive in Italy (Operation Grapeshot), 2nd AGRA supported V Corps with five medium regimentsJackson, Vol VI, Pt III, p. 222. (56th Heavy Rgt having been transferred to 21st Army Group in Belgium by that stage.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 161‚Äì3.Ellis, Germany, p. 213; Appendix IV.) At the end of the war HQ 2nd AGRA appears to have been redesignated HQ 180th Infantry Brigade in the Central Mediterranean Force. Postwar An abortive attempt to reform 2nd AGRA in the Canal Zone of Middle East Command was made on 9 December 1954 and abandoned on 1 February 1955.Frederick, p. 1053. A new HQ, 'Y' AGRA (AA), began forming at Warrington on 21 March 1955 to command anti-aircraft (AA) units of the Territorial Army (TA) in North West England. It was designated 2 AGRA (AA) by 15 July, and had the following composition:Routledge, Table LXXV, p. 442.AGRAs at British Army 1945 onwards. * 314th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery * 436th (South Lancashire Artillery) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery * 441st Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery * 470th (3rd West Lancashire) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery Anti-Aircraft Command had been disbanded on 10 March 1955 and all these regiments were the result of multiple mergers of pre-existing TA regiments.Frederick, pp. 1004, 1013‚Äì4, 1016‚Äì7.Routledge, p. 439. 2 AGRA (AA) was placed in suspended animation on 1 April 1959 (on the same day that a new 40 AGRA (AA) (TA) was formed at Warrington) and disbanded on 1 January 1962.

He has been described as \\"first among several artists who brought a national distinction to the Washington art community, and who were instrumental in making it more professional through the establishment of schools, clubs, and exhibitions.\\" Life and career Born in Warrenton, Virginia, Brooke was the son of James Vass Brooke and Mary Norris Brooke; he lived in Warrenton through the American Civil War, during which it was under occupation by the Union Army. He is believed to have received his earliest instruction in art from William D. Washington, although definitive proof has never been found. The elder Brooke had made arrangements for his son to travel to Rome to study art under William Randolph Barbee, but the outbreak of war prevented the trip from taking place. Instead in 1865 Richard matriculated at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, at which he studied under Edmund Bonsell and James Lambdin, and from which he graduated in 1871. While living in Philadelphia he taught at a number of schools, including the Mount Vernon Institute; the Broad Street Military Academy, and Villa Nova College. At the death of William D. Washington in 1871, Brooke was appointed the chair of the Department of Fine Arts at the Virginia Military Institute, but he left the position the following year. In 1873 he became United States Consul at La Rochelle, in which role he remained until 1877; during his time in France he studied with L√©on Bonnat, and later he would work with Carolus-Duran and Benjamin Constant. Brooke's studio building in Warrenton Brooke settled in Washington, D.C. in 1880 and remained associated with the artistic life of that town until his death. He continued to travel to Europe, at various points visiting Paris, London, and The Hague. In Washington he moved into Vernon Row, a well-regarded studio building east of the White House, where he painted and displayed his art to the public. Later, with Max Weyl, he established a \\"Barbizon Studio\\" diagonally across from the former Corcoran Gallery on 17th St. and Pennsylvania Ave., but the commercial nature of the neighborhood meant that a true artistic community could not take hold in the area. Brooke soon became active in the artistic affairs of his new city, becoming vice-president of the Washington Art Club in 1881 and remaining in that role until 1884. In the latter year he was among those who founded the Art Students League of Washington, at which he would also work as an instructor. Long on the staff of the Corcoran School, he serve as its vice principal from 1902 until 1917; his work was seen in the Corcoran Biennials of 1912, 1914, and 1916. He was also a member of the Washington Water Color Club, and showed work at that society's group exhibitions. In 1909, and again in 1913, he chaired the Medals and Badges Committee of the President's Inaugural Committee. In 1882 his work appeared in the annual show of the National Academy of Design; his paintings were also seen at William MacBeth's gallery. He was an exhibitor at the Cotton States and International Exposition, at which he won a medal, and at the National Conservation Exposition, at which his work appeared alongside that of numerous Washington colleagues. During his career he won a number of awards, including the Parsons Prize from the Society of Washington Artists in 1901 and the third Corcoran prize in 1904. In tandem with his work as a painter, in 1882 Brooke embarked on a second career as a purchaser of art for private collectors; Thomas E. Waggaman was his first client in this role. Outside of his artistic pursuits, Brooke was known as a devout Christian who led mission meetings on Sundays at the Fauquier County Courthouse. He kept active in Warrenton affairs for much of his adult life; in 1882 he painted a flag to be presented to the Warrenton Rifles upon their journey to Yorktown to participate in the centennial celebration of the battle there, and on November 15, 1889, he was among those who saved William Washington's portrait of John Marshall from being destroyed in a fire that engulfed the courthouse. That same year he rented space in the Town Hall for use as an art gallery, and shortly thereafter erected a summer studio in town. In his later years he passed his time between Washington and Warrenton, dying in the town of his birth at the home of his nephew. He is buried in the Warrenton Cemetery alongside his parents and younger sister. In his honor a memorial exhibit was mounted at the Corcoran in the year of his death. Work A Pastoral Visit, oil on canvas of 1881, in the collection of the National Gallery of Art Brooke first achieved notice as a painter of genre scenes of African-American life; in 1871 and 1872, a number of such pieces were reproduced in Harper's Magazine, and his first major canvas upon returning from France, A Pastoral Visit, is representative of his work in the genre. Unusually among his contemporaries, he chose to depict his black subjects in a sympathetic, rather than a caricatured, light. He explained his motives in a letter offering the painting for sale to the Corcoran Gallery of Art: > It must have struck many of you that the fine range of subject afforded by > Negro domestic life has been strangely abandoned to works of flimsy > treatment and vulgar exaggeration. That peculiar humor which is > characteristic of the race, and varies with the individual, cannot be thus > crudely conveyed. > > In entering this field, by the advice of many of my Artist friends, and > with the equipment of a foreign training, I have had a deliberate purpose in > view. It has been my aim while recognizing in proper measure the humorous > features of my subject, to elevate it to that plane of sober and truthful > treatment which, in French Art, has dignified the Peasant subjects of Jules > Breton, and should characterize every work of Art. I am pleased to think, > from the reception given by the public to this effort, that my object, > however realized! has been felt and appreciated. The Corcoran accepted the work for display, and for many years it remained a favorite in the museum's collection of American art. Brooke produced numerous other genre pieces during his career, most notably A Dog Swap; he seems, however, to have preferred to paint landscapes instead of genre pieces, and spent much time depicting the landscape around Warrenton. With William Henry Holmes, Edmund Clarence Messer, James Henry Moser, and Max Weyl, among others, he formed a group, sometimes referred to as the \\"Washington Landscape School\\", whose paintings were inspired by the Barbizon school and by the then- contemporary work of Dutch painters. He also achieved a great deal of success as a portraitist. Over 200 of his paintings and drawings were lost when a fire swept Warrenton in 1909 and destroyed his summer studio, at which he had gathered many paintings in preparation for an upcoming exhibition. The Pastoral Visit remained in the collection of the Corcoran Gallery of Art until that institution's dissolution, at which point it entered the collection of the National Gallery of Art. In the Smithsonian American Art Museum collection Brooke is represented by three works: A Dog Swap of 1881 and two undated works on paper, Burial of a Papoose and Yellowstone Geyser. Two paintings are owned by the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, a depiction of Pocahontas completed in 1907, and a View of Gloucester Harbor dated to around 1910. Two portraits by Brooke are held by the United States House of Representatives. One, of John Marshall, is a copy of the Washington portrait which Brooke had saved from the fire at the Fauquier County Courthouse; the other, of Speaker Robert M. T. Hunter, was among those ordered removed from display by Nancy Pelosi in 2020 in response to protests over the killing of George Floyd. A Civil War genre painting of 1872, Furling the Flag, is in the collection of the West Point Museum.

He also occupied several high-ranking colonial positions for the Venetian Republic. Iacopo Barozzi was the firstborn son of Andrea Barozzi, the second lord of Santorini and Therasia. These fiefs had been conquered by the Byzantine Empire in the 1270s, and Iacopo's early career was as a colonial administrator for the Venetian Republic in the Aegean: in the early 1290s he served as rector of Chania in the Venetian colony of Crete, then as Bailo of Negroponte from August 1295 to 1297, and finally as Duke of Candia in Crete from 1301 to 1303. Iacopo tried to use his position to recover his father's domains from the Byzantines. In 1301, the Duke of Naxos, William I Sanudo, who considered himself as the feudal overlord of the island, was preparing an expedition to recover Santorini. Its fate is unclear, but in a treaty concluded between Venice and the Byzantine emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos in 1302, Venetian possession of the island was recognized. Iacopo was restored to his position as dominator insularum Sancte Erini et Thyrasie, but recognized only Venice, not the Duke of Naxos, as his suzerain. As a result, the latter seized Iacopo as he was passing through his domains at the end of his tenure as Duke of Candia. The Great Council of Venice promptly intervened and ordered Iacopo's release. Iacopo retired to Candia, where he died in 1308.

He was also an all-round sportsman competing in football, amateur wrestling, and competitive cycling. Biography Bailey was an amateur wrestler before taking up professional wrestling, beginning his career by asking to be trained at Fred Porter's gymnasium and impressing with his ability to lift weights. He was a respected heavyweight as of 1913, and was Australian amateur heavyweight champion by 1914. He continued wrestling during the First World War, beating a J. McKenna in a bout at the Railway Institute in Melbourne in 1917. In 1918 he helped organize an Athletics Programme in Melbourne as part of a Police Charity Carnival. In 1920 Bailey was one of two wrestlers to be able to throw Australian Olympic prospect Roy Jenkin during his training at the Victorian Railways Institute, although he lost to him in the Ballarat Championship later in the year. As of 1921 Bailey had begun training boxers. As of 1922 professional wrestling had almost ceased to exist in Australia since the First World War and the company Country Stadiums Ltd. aimed to re-establish it. The professional wrestling Heavyweight Championship had been vacated when Clarence Weber retired in 1913, and in August a meeting of Victorian professional wrestlers was held at which it was determined that Joe Bailey and Billy Meeske had the best claims to be heavyweight champion and a match between them was scheduled. Meeske promoted the fight by antagonizing Bailey by publicly wagering money and suggesting that Bailey may not show due to cowardice. They wrestled for the heavyweight championship on November 22 at Melbourne Stadium, and Bailey lost leading to Meeske becoming champion. Bailey did not consider returning to the ring until July 1923 when he began training again, however no match was scheduled. In 1927 he announced he was willing to wrestle any heavyweight in Melbourne, and in October 1927 he refereed a match between Ted Thye and Walter Miller in Launceston. In 1928 a Launceston promoter offered to book him, with Sam Burmeister agreeing to wrestle him in Launceston in May, although it is not clear if the match ultimately took place. As of 1930 Bailey had begun coaching boxers in Melbourne, and he coached boxing and amateur wrestling up until a few months before his passing.

The book includes photographs and maps. Its photographs were especially powerful in spreading news of the event.

The bill was signed into law by then-governor Jerry Brown on September 30, 2018 and took effect on January 1, 2019. State Senator Nancy Skinner introduced the bill and it was sponsored by advocacy groups including the ACLU of California, Anti-Police Terror Project, Black Lives Matter, California Faculty Association, California News Publishers Association, and Youth Justice Coalition.  Details of the bill = Newly available information  Records related to: * Officer shooting at a person * Officer use of force causing death or great bodily injury against a person * Officer sexually assaulting a person * Officer dishonesty about a crime or misconduct of another officer  Redactions  Only the following may be redacted: * Personal information (home address, phone number, etc - as listed in bill) of the officer * Information to preserve the anonymity of complainants and witnesses  Disclosure delays  Disclosure may be delayed when: * The record is subject of an active criminal or administrative investigation ** A record may be delayed a maximum of 60 days from use of force ** After 60 days, a record may delayed for up to 18 months if the record expected to interfere with a proceeding *** Written explanations for the delay must be provided at 180 day intervals * Criminal charges are filed related to the incident ** The disclosure of records may be delayed until a verdict on those charges is returned at trial ** If a plea of guilty or no contest is entered, the time to withdraw the plea pursuant to Section 1018  Additional details  * Frivolous complaints, as defined in Section 128.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, shall not be released * If an officer publicly makes a statement that is false about their own investigation via an established medium (TV, radio, newspaper), the agency may release factual information concerning the investigation  Loopholes  Only sustained findings are required to be released. When an officer resigns the findings are not considered sustained and the records remains hidden. This loophole was used by Paso Robles Police Department to avoid releasing investigation records relating to a rape accusation about former Sgt. Christopher McGuire.  Response  When SB 1421 took effect on January 1st, 2019, there was disagreement about if the law applies to records before the law took place. In April, Karl Olson, a San Francisco attorney, said there are as many as 20 lawsuits related to requests seeking access to records. In March, over 170 agencies were fighting the new law. Attempts to block the release of records mostly failed.  Delays  Six months after the law took effect, many of the state‚Äôs largest law enforcement agencies had produced little to no records. * The California Highway Patrol had produced no records. * L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva‚Äôs department would not cooperate unless reporters identified specific cases. * The Los Angeles County Probation Department will not release records, citing laws prohibiting records about minors from being released. * The San Francisco Police Department has released no disciplinary records. * The Fresno Police Department initially denied all requests. * The San Jose Police Department, under Chief Edgardo Garcia, released only six full files 1.5 years after the law took effect.  Fees  Several law enforcement agencies requested significant fees for access to records. * West Sacramento estimated the cost to redact five shootings worth of material would be $25,000. * LAist was charged $1,655 for redacted audio related to shootings.  Destruction  Cities destroyed records before the law took place. Yuba County destroyed records just after the law took effect. County officials claimed the purge was routine despite the fact that many of the records were years past their required retention dates.  Findings  Here are some examples of records released due to SB 1421. * The Ceres police department's internal investigation found officers justified in ramming Nicholas Pimentel‚Äôs vehicle during a high speed pursuit and then using another car to pin the vehicle against a truck. Before these documents were released, the city was sued for this case and settled for $2 million. * The San Francisco Department of Police Accountability released document showing that they found the offices who shot Alex Nieto and Amilcar Perez-Lopez to be acting within policy. * In May 2020, the city of Fullerton published 2,400 pages of documents about the 2011 death of Kelly Thomas (a case which has been described as \\"one of the worst police beatings in [US] history\\"), revealing for example that supervisors had ‚Äúedited‚Äù the reports provided by the involved officers, and that one of them had already been on a performance improvement plan due to a prior incident.  Expansion via Senate Bill 776  In June 2020, during the George Floyd protests, Senator Nancy Skinner introduced Senate Bill 776 to expand upon SB 1421. SB 776 would: * Make more records available including: ** All use of force records available, not just those with \\"great bodily injury\\" ** Complains that aren't sustained, closing a major loophole ** Complaints related to actions against any protected class ** Sustained information related to wrongful arrests or searches * Allow police records more than five years old to be used in trial * Require agencies to review officer history before hiring them * Limit fees agencies can charge * Add civil fines for agencies that don't comply  References  SB 1421 Category:2018 in American law SB 1421 SB 1421 SB 1421 ","title":"California Senate Bill 1421 (2018)"},{"id":"64342018","text":"Grant Heard (born March 4, 1978) is an American football coach and former player who is currently the co-offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach at Indiana University.

Waithood is the time in which young people are ‚Äúno longer children in need of care, but ‚Ä¶ are still unable to become independent adults,‚Äù. Honwana has argued that youth protest movements arise because of economic and societal pressures. Honwana argued that youth-led protests often struggle to translate their political aspirations into meaningful action, particularly because they struggle to articulate what they want to achieve.

It is affiliated with the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. The hospital features all private rooms that consist of 190 pediatric beds. The hospital provides comprehensive pediatric specialties and subspecialties to infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0‚Äì21 throughout the region. The hospital also sometimes treats adults that require pediatric care. The hospital shares the rooftop helipad for the attached Strong Memorial Hospital and is an ACS verified level I pediatric trauma center, one of the only ones in the region. The hospital features a regional pediatric intensive-care unit and an American Academy of Pediatrics verified level IV neonatal intensive care unit. GCH also offers one of the country's few Ronald McDonald Houses that is located within a hospital.  History  Pediatrics at University of Rochester Medicine has historically taken place inside of pediatric units within Strong Memorial Hospital, which combined added up to a 124-bed capacity. These units were known as Children's Hospital at Strong before being renamed to \\"Golisano Children's Hospital\\" in 2002 after a $14 million donation from Paychex founder, Tom Golisano. In 2011 plans were made to build a new freestanding children's hospital and Tom Golisano once again donated $20 million to help with the construction of the new project, with his donations totaling $34 million to the hospital. Plans called for new 245,000 SqF, nine-story building with 2 floors empty to use as shell space for future expansion. Construction was set in two parts, with part one opening in 2015. The project was set at a price of $134 million, the largest project ever for the University of Rochester. Large donations were made to the hospital from large charities including $7 million from the Wegman Family Foundation, $5 million from Georgia Gosnell, and $3 million from Rick Aab in honor of the Ganatra family. Phase two of construction began in fall 2016 and included pediatric specific operating rooms and a new pediatric intensive care unit. Construction for phase two took place in the 2 floors that were left for later expansion. Phase two was completed by the summer of 2017. In early 2020 the hospital rolled out a new service for parents of babies that were in the neonatal intensive care unit. The service run by company, AngelEye is able to provide video 24/7 to parents when they can't be in the nicu with their child. Currently there are 20 cameras installed entirely funded by local donations. These cameras are free for parent use.  About  The new hospital offers many amenities to children previously unseen at Children's Hospital at Strong including a teen lounge, multiple playrooms, and child friendly theming and design.  Patient Care Units  * 12 bed pediatric intensive care unit * 68 bed level IV neonatal intensive care unit * 10 bed pediatric emergency department * 56 beds general pediatrics  Awards  Parents Magazine has ranked the hospital as one of the 20 best children's hospitals in the country in their top 20 pediatric technology and innovations rankings. In 2012-13 U.S. News & World Report ranked Golisano Children's Hospital nationally in 4 pediatric specialties. Rankings included #41 in pediatric gastroenterology, #27 in pediatric neonatology, #44 in pediatric neurology and neurosurgery, and #38 in pediatric orthopedics. The 2013-14 U.S. News & World Report ranked Golisano Children's Hospital nationally in pediatric orthopedics. The 2019-20 U.S. News & World Report ranked Golisano Children's Hospital nationally in pediatric nephrology and neonatology. The 2020-21 U.S. News & World Report ranked the hospital nationally in neonatology, taking up the #23 place nationally.

The conference was attended by over 7,000 party officials nationwide, focusing on the issues of the Great Leap Forward which resulted in the deaths of tens of millions in the Great Chinese Famine. CCP Chairman Mao Zedong made self-criticism during the conference, after which he took a semi-retired role, leaving future responsibilities to Chinese President Liu Shaoqi and CCP senior leader Deng Xiaoping.  The Conference  leftThe Conference took place in Beijing, China from January 11 through February 7, 1962. During the conference, Liu Shaoqi, the 2nd President of China and CCP vice-chairman, delivered an important speech that formally attributed 30% of the famine to natural disasters and 70% to man-made mistakes, which were mainly the far-left policies of the Great Leap Forward since 1958. The policies of Mao Zedong were criticized, and Mao also made self-criticism as the conference promoted \\"criticism and self- criticism\\". Another CCP vice-chairman Lin Biao, however, continued his praises of Mao at the conference. The conference promoted \\"democratic centralism\\" within the Communist Party.  Influence  After the 7000 Cadres Conference, Liu Shaoqi together with Deng Xiaoping, was in charge of most policies within the party and the government, while Mao took a semi-retired role. The conference corrected some of the far-left economic policies. Economic reforms such as \\"sanzi yibao (‰∏âËá™‰∏ÄÂåÖ)\\" which allowed free market and household responsibility for agricultural production were carried out by Liu Shaoqi, Deng Zihui and others. The reforms alleviated the economic difficulties after the Great Leap Forward to an extent.  Aftermath  217x217px However, the disagreement between Mao and Liu (and Deng) became more and more apparent, especially on Mao's call to \\"never forget class struggle\\". In August 1962, Mao emphasized during a meeting in Beidaihe that class struggle must be talked about \\"every year, every month and every day (Âπ¥Âπ¥ËÆ≤, ÊúàÊúàËÆ≤, Êó•Êó•ËÆ≤)\\". Mao reinforced his point of view in September 1962 during a national conference of the Chinese Communist Party (ÂÖ´Â±äÂçÅ‰∏≠ÂÖ®‰ºö). Mao also criticized the economic reforms carried out by Liu Shaoqi and others, even describing the reforms to foreign leaders as \\"attempts to undermine socialist collectivism and destroy socialism\\" in February 1964. In 1963, Mao launched the nationwide Socialist Education Movement and in 1966, he launched the Cultural Revolution in order to return to the center of power, during which Liu was persecuted to death as a \\"traitor\\" as well as a \\"capitalist roader\\" and Deng was also purged (twice). CCP vice-chairman Lin Biao, on the other hand, was formally selected by Mao as his successor in 1969.

Ann had a life-long interest in antique porcelain dolls, which began in 1923 when she received her first doll as a gift from her parents on her eighth birthday. Each subsequent birthday and Christmas during her childhood, she received another doll. From 1972 to 2004 her doll collection was exhibited at the Brandywine River Museum in Chadds Ford during the Christmas holidays.Ann studied piano with William Hatton Greene, composition with Harl McDonald at the University of Pennsylvania, and painting with her father. In 1934 her composition Christmas Fantasy was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra, with Leopold Stokowski conducting. In 1935, Ann married John W. McCoy II, a young artist whom she had met when he studied with her father at the Chadds Ford studio. They had three children, John Denys, Anna Brelsford, and Maude Robin.Ann did not begin painting seriously until her children grew up.The first formal exhibition of her work, mainly watercolors, was in the late 1960s. The Brandywine River Museum has an Ann Wyeth McCoy collection, which contains correspondence, photographs, musical compositions, sound recordings, and her early drawings.

Premise The King of the Moon and his hutched companion are stranded in a dilapidated moon base held together by duct tape. Their mission is to explore time and space for unique things to broadcast to humans on Earth. This takes the form of bizarre music and news stories. The show is named after a 1953 black and white science fiction movie about the attempted sabotage of a moon base in 1970. Format Each show includes 12 full music tracks in pairs, often from the 1960s and 1970s (or modern pastiches of such), using exotic instruments such as the Moog synthesizer, steel drum, theremin, chiptune, kazoo, ukulele, and the voice of Wing. Music from the 1980s is typically excluded, the hosts describing it as \\"the forbidden decade\\". The show includes some regular sections: * The Unnecessary News, in which MC Zirconium reads humorous science-fiction-related news stories. (Example: \\"Meat and potato pie ‚Äòsent into space‚Äô from Wigan\\") * The Sea of Tranquillity, in which a contrastingly less-lively music track is played. * Poetry read by the Dalek Vicar, in which MC Zirconium imitates a polite Dalek. * Cover versions of the jazz song Caravan (of which over 350 exist). * Music created and submitted by listeners. Shows often have a theme that unifies the tracks and news. Often the theme is the music of, or inspired by, a particular artist who is celebrating an anniversary that week. Notably, there have been four episodes (7 hours) dedicated to French Moog musician Jean-Jacques Perrey, whom the hosts describe as \\"the patron saint of the show\\". Other example themes have been: * \\"Shapes\\" including tracks named The Glass Triangle, Isosceles Trapezoid, and Hendecagon. * \\"Popcorn\\" featuring numerous covers of the 1969 synth-pop track Popcorn by Gershon Kingsley. * \\"Shatnoy\\" featuring tracks by William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy and covers of Star Trek theme tunes. Episode 46 (\\"Cassette Heads\\") was also available to purchase on physical cassette tape. There has also been at least one live appearance of Project Moonbase alongside the group Space Dog at the Edinburgh International Science Festival in 2012. History=Leith FM Radio (2007-2010) The first episode of Project Moonbase was broadcast 15 June 2007 on Leith FM, an Edinburgh-based community radio station launched May 2007. Each episode was two hours in length and broadcast from 20:00 to 22:00 on Sunday evenings. After three years, the show ceased being broadcast for undisclosed reasons, though DJ Bongoboy claimed that \\"we left on good terms, or a least we would have, had anyone been there\\". The last radio broadcast of Project Moonbase was on 27 June 2010. Recordings of these shows are not available to the public, but were made available to paying subscribers of Project Moonbase. Podcast (2010-2017) Four months after the final radio broadcast, the show was continued in a podcast format, with the first episode (numbered 001) being released on the date 10/10/10. (One trial podcast had been released previously on 24 July 2010, recorded while still part of Leith FM.) Aside from the duration being reduced from 2 hours to 1 hour, the format of the show remained unchanged and was released every Sunday evening for the next seven years for a total of 273 episodes plus 20 bonus episodes. These are all available at no cost from the Project Moonbase website, and have also been added to the Internet Archive. In 2017, DJ Bongoboy suffered a stroke, and was unable to continue hosting in a conversational format. The last episode of the podcast was released 17 March 2017. Spotify (2018-present) The format of the show changed, dividing the content between two media. Music is presented as a weekly Spotify playlist on a particular theme. The first playlist, entitled \\"PMB Super Galactic Modulation 1\\" was released 13 May 2018, and a new one has been released every Sunday since then. News is reported daily by both hosts via the show's official Facebook and Twitter social media accounts. Hosts=DJ Bongoboy Baldock playing bells with Space Dog, Brighton 2011 The official website describes DJ Bongoboy as a \\"genial host, broadcaster, polymath, ruthless leader, de-facto king of the moon, Moon-Pope and space- penguin\\". His real name is Robert Baldock, from East Lothian, a J2EE technical developer by day, \\"space age bachelor by night\\". He creates experimental music under the name Aleatory Music Systems using \\"analogue synths, Java applications and Max/MSP/Jitter\\", and has performed at the Edinburgh Art Festival and Edinburgh Annuale. He occasionally remixes tracks for the podcast, and has also released items on Bandcamp on behalf of Project Moonbase (with cover art by co-host Fielding) including an album of telephone ringtones Ringtones from Space Volume 1, and a track The Coming of the Dial to accompany telephony-themed podcast episode 208 Dial M For Moonbase. He has also performed with the group Space Dog in Brighton and Edinburgh. Baldock suffered a stroke in March 2017 (aged 52) leaving him with acute dysphasia and verbal dyspraxia which prevented him from presenting the podcast. He was forced to move in to more accessible housing. He appeared on national television and the local newspaper front-page after Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the life-saving thrombectomy operation he received would no longer be available to an expected 600 Scottish patients in 2018. Baldock handed a petition of 4,147 names to Health Secretary Jeane Freeman requesting restoration of thrombectomy as an option for patients. The musical group The Twelve Hour Foundation, who created the theme tune and jingles for Project Moonbase, released a charity EP (with cover artwork by host Andy Fielding) which raised ¬£350 for The Charles Bell Pavilion unit where Baldock was treated. MC Zirconium The official website describes MC Zirconium as a \\"jovial sidekick, prisoner, news-hound, dogs-body, dog\\". Each show, he reports on quirky stories that he has found on websites such as Boing Boing. His real name is Andy Fielding, a graphic designer residing in Edinburgh. Fielding creates unique artwork for every episode of Project Moonbase and sells prints on his own website. He was the creator of the 2006 Cartoon Network show IMP. Fielding also created the 2008 animated series Life According to Dinosaurs for UK Channel 4, of which the two dinosaur protagonists were voiced by the pair of Project Moonbase hosts (\\"Dave Yellow\\" by Baldock, \\"Steve Green\\" by Fielding). Describing his taste in music, Zirconium said in 2011: > I like my sonification to fill me with terror. If I am listening to > radiation emanating from distant parts of the universe, I want to feel > horrified by the scientific majesty of it all.

John Wallop, 2nd Earl of Portsmouth inherited Hurstbourne in 1762, and from 1780 to 1785, a new house was built by John Meadows, designed by James Wyatt (1747-1813). In 1891, it burned down, and Isaac Newton Wallop, 5th Earl of Portsmouth died a few months later. His son, Newton Wallop, 6th Earl of Portsmouth, had a new house built in 1891 to 1894. In 1936, the house and the deer park was sold to Ossian Donner, who gave it to his son Patrick Donner. During the Second World War it was used by the Bank of England, and Sir Patrick regained possession in 1947 and reduced the house to just under half its original size in 1965. In December 2000, Leonie Schroder and her then- husband Nicholas Fane bought the 1200-acre estate from the Donner family. A year later, they planned to demolish the remains of the 19th-century house and build a new one, whilst retaining the listed stable block, and the 19th century walled garden and pump house.

Fanfarelli is an American professor at Marist's School of Communication and the Arts in New York who has published studies and articles on gamification, digital badges, games, and online learning. Fanfarelli holds both a PhD (2014) and a M.S. (2012) in Modeling and Simulation, as well as a B.S. (2009) in Psychology, from the University of Central Florida. From 2015-2019, he served as an Assistant Professor for the University of Central Florida before becoming an Associate Professor for Marist College in 2019. He has worked on numerous simulation and training projects for a variety of partners, including the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and NASA.. Dr. Fanfarelli holds a patent on an automated system designed to simulate human judgement when comparing two digital images. Used to support simulation-based training environments, the system can also be used to help predict when a human is likely to notice a difference between two similar images  Research  The focus of Fanfarelli's research has been on gamification, digital badges, games, and online learning. Some arguments associated with this research are listed as follows: * Some of the characteristics of digital badges that are regarded as having the most advantages include (a) offering more accurate and precise data regarding a person‚Äôs skills and abilities; (b) outlining information in a way that lends itself to greater simplicity and clarity; (c) aiding the development of personalized learning pathways; and (d) improving user or learner motivation. * Some of the issues associated with digital badges that are deemed worthy of concern or in need of improvement include (a) considerations regarding student or user privacy, (b) a lack of political support structures and external recognition (sometimes referred to as the ‚Äúchicken-and-egg‚Äù problem); (c) concerns that badges may serve as a threat to intrinsic motivation; and (d) what some may perceive as the ‚Äúcommercialism‚Äù effect of digital badging in environments where this may be regarded as unwanted or unethical. * Digital badging systems should be designed differently in consideration of the context in which they are used. Such contexts may include education and training, gaming (e.g., video games), mobile applications, or the military. * There are three general subsystems of any digital badging system that you will want to evaluate and test prior to release: (a) the showcasing system; (b) the issuing system; and (c) the notification system. * We may be able to gain valuable clues into the future of digital badging by relying on the theories of recurrence and recombination. These theories suggest novel technologies develop in a way that often follows the same path as similar, historical technologies (recurrence), and that new technologies can often be developed as a side product of combining other, sometimes unrelated technologies (recombination).

She is the co-founder of Our Table. Career=Activism Kisyombe began her activism by volunteering with the Irish Refugee Council where she met caf√© owner and Irish Examiner food columnist Michelle Darmody with whom she founded Our Table, initially catering events at venues such as the Irish Museum of Modern Art. They held a pop-up caf√© in the Project Arts Centre in 2016, first as a two-day event which was extended to three-months. The project highlights the lack of facilities for food preparation in Direct Provision centres and advocates for the ending of the Direct Provision system. After this, Kisyombe was invited by Darina Allen to undertake a three-month internship at Ballymaloe Cookery School. She is now the volunteer director of the company. Our Table have supplied a line of hot sauces, sold by The Good Food Store, and Kisyombe runs a food stall in Dublin since January 2018 with hopes of opening a kitchen that would serve as a training space. Alongside Sin√©ad Burke, Eileen Flynn, and Mari Kennedy, Kisyombe was on a panel hosted by Miriam O'Callaghan at Electric Picnic in 2017 for The Women's Podcast. She is also active in the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, and has spoken out about her experiences of racism in Ireland. She appeared in Hozier's Nina Cried Power video with other activists. Social Democrat candidacy In 2019, Kisyombe ran as a candidate in the local elections with the Social Democrats in Dublin's North Inner City constituency. She was the first person living in Direct Provision to run in local elections. She came under scrutiny when The Sunday Times wrote about the discrepancies between her version of her asylum applications and the official records. In particular, this centred around how Kisyombe omitted her asylum application in the United Kingdom in 2014 and other discrepancies in the time line of her asylum applications. This led to the resignation of a number of party members. The party conducted an independent review, and she was allowed to continue her election campaign. Kisyombe claimed that the incident had hurt her campaign. Personal life Ellie Kisyombe was born in Malawi. Both of her parents were public servants, her mother in the Malawian treasury and her father was the head of Malawi's agricultural development body. Her father was a polygamist. She was involved in anti-corruption campaigns in Malawi, and her family are members of the opposition political party. Kisyombe believes that her father died by poisoning due to his political activities. After a series of crackdowns, she was advised to leave the country. She spent some time in Bristol between 2007 and 2019. She travelled to Ireland on a student visa in 2010. She then travelled to the United Kingdom to apply for asylum there. After being arrested there, she claimed asylum in Ireland. She was placed in Direct Provision and was housed in the centre in Ballyhaunis, County Mayo. She was later diagnosed with depression. She has twin children, a son and a daughter, who joined her in Ireland. In July 2019, she was granted leave to remain in Ireland.

The site hosts user-generated image galleries primarily of pornographic content originating or derived from anime, manga, and video games, such as fanart, scanlations of manga and d≈çjinshi, and cosplay photographs. Its sister site Exhentai (colloquially known as Sad Panda) was spun off from E-Hentai in 2010 to host artwork that depicts material that is illegal in certain jurisdictions, such as lolicon, shotacon, and bestiality. History E-Hentai launched as a Yahoo! Group on July 1, 1999. The group moved to a .net domain in 2001 before moving to its current .org domain in 2005 after ownership of its .net domain lapsed and was purchased by another party. On March 27, 2010, E-Hentai announced that in response to pressure from advertisers, it would no longer host artwork depicting underage characters (lolicon and shotacon) and bestiality. Existing galleries containing this content were deleted from the site, amounting to the removal of approximately 30,000 of the website's 150,000 galleries; this content was later spun off onto Exhentai, a sister site to E-Hentai. Access to Exhentai requires an existing E-Hentai account; for individuals without an account, Exhentai appears as a blank page with an illustration of a crying panda, and has consequently has earned the nickname \\"Sad Panda\\" among users of the site. In June 2019, both sites were removed from Google, per the company's policy of de-listing websites that violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. On July 26, 2019, E-Hentai and Exhentai announced that both sites would shut down in response to \\"recent legislative changes in the Netherlands\\", where the servers of the sites were hosted at the time. Vice speculated that the shutdown was in reaction to the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market adopted by the European Union in June 2019, which makes digital platforms legally liable for material posted by users that violates copyright, as well as a July 2019 proposal by Dutch Minister of Justice Ferdinand Grapperhaus to impose harsher punishments on websites that do not rapidly remove child pornography. 24 hours' notice was given for the shutdown of Exhentai, leading users on the image board 4chan to attempt to archive the entire site before it closed on July 27. On August 2, 2019, Exhentai relaunched after its servers relocated to Moldova. Operations Works posted to E-Hentai and Exhentai are typically pirated and are uploaded without the consent or knowledge of the original creators. The site is owned and operated by an anonymous moderator who uses the handle Tenboro and is funded through a combination of advertising revenue and donations; in 2009, E-Hentai estimated its annual hosting costs at USD$46,000, with donations covering \\"less than half\\" of operating costs. In 2019, Tenboro stated that a persistent tendon injury limited their ability to perform timely maintenance on the website and that they were considering options for its future, such as naming a successor moderator or preserving the website as a permanent archive. Impact Collectively, E-Hentai and Exhentai are one of the largest databases of hentai manga and contain over 100,000 image galleries. The site hosts both original Japanese hentai manga and scanlations in multiple languages, including Chinese, English, French, German, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Thai. At its peak popularity, the commercial web traffic company Alexa ranked E-Hentai as the 264th-most popular website on the internet. Outlets have noted that E-Hentai functions as a de facto archive for artwork that is rare or non- existent on other physical and digital platforms; the site hosts content such as Comiket-exclusive works (d≈çjin) and out-of-print art books that are both pornographic and non-pornographic in nature, with Vice calling the website the \\"Alexandria Library of hentai\\". The Daily Dot described E-Hentai as \\"a relic of 'the old internet, citing it as an example of niche portals for digital content that predate contemporary social media.

Langenheim (n√©e Harmon, born September 5, 1925) is an American plant ecologist and ethnobotanist, highly respected as an eminent scholar and a pioneer for women in the field. She has done field research in arctic, tropical, and alpine environments across five continents, with interdisciplinary research that spans across the fields of chemistry, geology, and botany. Her early research helped determine the plant origins of amber and led to her career-long work investigating the chemical ecology of resin- producing trees, including the role of plant resins for plant defense and the evolution of several resin-producing trees in the tropics. She wrote what is regarded as the authoritative reference on the topic: Plant Resins: Chemistry, Evolution, Ecology, and Ethnobotany, published in 2003. Langenheim earned a PhD in botany with a minor in geology in 1953 from the University of Minnesota. She was the first female faculty member in the natural sciences and first woman to be promoted to full professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. She was the first woman to serve as president for the Association for Tropical Biology, second woman to serve as president of the Ecological Society of America (ESA) and Society for Economic Botany, founded and served as the first president for the International Society of Chemical Ecology, and is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the California Academy of Sciences. During her time as ESA president, she initiated a project to document women's experiences and contributions to the field of ecology and conducted a follow-up project in 1996. Her research was summarized in two publications, and resulted in a large historical collection and a continued effort by ESA to document women's contributions to the field.  Early life and education  Langenheim was born in Homer, Louisiana in 1925 and grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She graduated from Tulsa Central High School in 1943. Langenheim received a Bachelor of Science degree in biology from the University of Tulsa (UT) in 1946. She was the first woman student body president at UT. She earned her Master of Science in 1949 and PhD in 1953, both in botany with a minor in geology from the University of Minnesota. Her PhD advisor was leading plant ecologist W.S. Cooper, who went against university policy to sponsor her as a doctoral student; at the time, women could pursue up to a Master's degree. Her dissertation was entitled, \\"Vegetation and environmental patterns in the Crested Butte Area, Gunnison County, Colorado \\" and was subsequently published in Ecological Monographs.  Career and legacy  Langenheim has conducted interdisciplinary research across five continents in the fields of plant ecology, paleobotany, and ethnobotany. She has conducted field work in the western United States, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Australia, New Zealand, Angola, Kenya, Ghana, and the Amazon rainforest. Her work has spanned the fields of botany, geology, and chemistry and included research on tropical plants, redwoods, and Pacific coast plants. She is known internationally for her research and is considered a trailblazer in plant sciences and ecology, and a pioneer for women in the field. She began her career at a time when opportunities for women in sciences were limited. In the introduction to her memoir, The Odyssey of a Woman Field Scientist, she recounts: > \\"I lived through the period of being the token woman in numerous situations; > I was not an activist fighting on the front lines, so to speak, but tried to > demonstrate the capability of women through my own hard work and > accomplishments.\\" She was the first female faculty member in the natural sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) when she joined the faculty in 1966, and the first woman at the university to be promoted to full professor when she became Chair of the biology department in 1973. She was an advisor or co-advisor for 41 graduate students during her time on the faculty. She taught undergraduate and graduate classes at UCSC from 1966-1994, retired from the university officially in 1994, but continued to advise graduate students as emerita faculty until 2009 and remain active in research, the university community, and scientific societies. Langenheim was the first woman to serve as president for the Association for Tropical Biology (now the Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation) in 1985 and second woman to serve as president for the Ecological Society of America (ESA) from 1986‚Äì87 and the Society for Economic Botany from 1993-94. She also founded and served as the first president for the International Society of Chemical Ecology from 1986-87 and served as academic vice president for the Organization for Tropical Studies from 1975-77.  Early career  After completing her PhD, Langenheim advanced her career in teaching and plant ecology research at a variety of institutions. She was an instructor in field ecology at the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab (RMBL) from 1953‚Äì66 and served as a member of the RMBL board of directors (1962‚Äì65) and as vice president (1965‚Äì66). From 1955-59, she was a lecturer, instructor, and research associate at San Francisco College for Women (now Lone Mountain College) and Mills College.Bibliography. Jean H. Langenheim.

These experiences at fine liberal arts colleges, where > women‚Äôs issues were at the forefront, prepared me [for] action supporting > women scientists, as well as for later teaching at UCSC with a liberal arts > approach to undergraduate education.\\" She was also a research associate in the botany department at the University of California Berkeley from 1954‚Äì59 and a teaching associate in the botany department at the University of Illinois Urbana from 1959-62. From 1962 through 1966 she was a research fellow in the Harvard University Biological Labs, a scholar of the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study (now the Bunting Institute), a research associate in the Harvard Botanical Museum, a Cabot Fellow, and an American Association of University Women Wiley Fellow. It was during her time at Harvard that she began her research on the ecology and evolution of plant resins and amber. Langenheim joined the faculty of UCSC in 1966, one year after the campus was established. She was a founding member of the Adlai E. Stevenson College, where she lived as the faculty preceptor for several years, and helped develop the graduate programs at the university. Her botany course, co-taught with plant physiologist Kenneth Thimann, was \\"highly popular because of the way it related plants to human affairs\\" and led to publication of a textbook in 1982 entitled Botany: Plant Biology and Its Relation to Human Affairs. She also taught graduate courses in tropical and chemical ecology and the history of ecological concepts. She was a visiting professor at Harvard and the Universidade de Par√° in Brazil in 1974, and served as Chair of the biology department at UCSC from 1974-1976.  Plant resins and amber  Langenheim is well known for her more than 40 years investigating plant resins and amber. Her research on plant resins spans from the chemistry, geologic history, and ecological role to their uses throughout human history. In 1961, she began conducting research at Harvard University to study fossilized plant resin, also known as amber, and the ecology and evolution of resin-producing trees in the tropics. While at Harvard, she conducted the first chemical studies of amber's plant origins through geologic time and wrote a seminal paper on the subject, published in Science in 1969, that established her as the leading expert on botanical sources of amber. It was this work that led to her career-long chemical ecology research on tropical resin-producing trees, including the mechanisms for producing resin and the role they play in insect and disease defense. She wrote what is regarded as the authoritative reference on the subject: Plant Resins: Chemistry, Evolution, Ecology, and Ethnobotany, published in 2003. The book was awarded the 2004 Mary W. Klinger Book Award from the Society for Economic Botany, which is given for an \\"outstanding book published in the discipline of Economic/Ethno Botany.\\"  Philanthropy  Langenheim has a history of philanthropic giving to UCSC. In 2004, she established the Jean H. Langenheim Graduate Fellowship in Plant Ecology and Evolution with an endowment gift of $200,000, to support students studying terrestrial plant ecology and evolution. When she published her memoir in 2010, all royalties from sales of the book were donated to the fellowship endowment. She also donated copies of her memoir to the UCSC Arboretum gift shop, with proceeds from sales going to support the Arboretum. In 2006, she established the Jean H. Langenheim Endowed Chair in Plant Ecology and Evolution with a gift of $350,000 to the university \\"to support and encourage research and teaching in the area of terrestrial plant ecology and evolution, including studies of human impacts on plants, such as global warming, introduction of invasive plants, and ecosystem destruction.\\"  Documenting women's contributions to ecology  In 1986, Langenheim began a project to document the careers, experiences, and accomplishments of other women contemporaries in ecology. She started the project because she was the second woman president of ESA at the time, and wanted to highlight the accomplishments of other women in the field: > \\"Since there have been so few women officers, and I was the only woman > president, except E. Lucy Braun, I decided that I would do my Presidential > Address on the history of women‚Äôs contributions to ecology. This would not > only ‚Äùeducate‚Äù many, but would also provide the opportunity to give tribute > to the accomplishments of women, and to many who have remained essentially > ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù (and hence unrecognized).\\" The project took two years, with surveys received from 55 women ecologists, and culminated in a speech to ESA members entitled \\"The Path and Progress of American Women Ecologists\\", which was subsequently published in the ESA Bulletin in December 1988. In 1996, she contacted colleagues again as an update to this project, with a focus on women's research contributions.

Description Mount Fernow is part of the Cascade Range, and is situated west of Stevens Pass in the Wild Sky Wilderness, on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The nearest higher neighbor is \\"K9\\", to the southeast. The Mount Fernow Potholes are a series of lakes approximately one mile north of this peak. This mountain's name was officially adopted in 1967 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. The name honors Bernhard Fernow (1851‚Äì1923), who was the third chief of the Division of Forestry of the United States. This mountain is one of two peaks in Washington state named for Bernhard Fernow, the other being Mount Fernow to the northeast in the Entiat Mountains. Climate Mt. Fernow in winter Mount Fernow is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Skykomish River. Geology Mt. Fernow is composed of tonalite of the Mount Stuart batholith. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is north of Mt. Fernow, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. Mt. Fernow and Glacier Peak from Otter Point During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Cascades.

McBride, and completed in 1909.Gibson, Richard (November 22, 2013). \\"Pekin Noodle Parlor (117 S Main Street)\\". Butte-Anaconda National Historic Landmark District. Retrieved June 21, 2020. Family relatives Hum Yow and Tam Kwong Yee soon established themselves as businessmen at the new location in Uptown Butte. Archivists note that when the restaurant first opened, \\"it catered to a diverse clientele of miners, theater-goers, and wealthy citizens. Then, as now, the menu featured Chinese American classics like chow mein, chop suey, and egg foo young.\\"Jack, Meghan E. (Spring 2020). \\"Exhibit Review (Chow: Making the Chinese American Restaurant)\\". The Journal of American Folklore. University of Illinois Press. 133 (528): 249-251. The restaurant offered a wide variety of dishes on its menu, but customers preferred their wet noodles (yaka mein) and chop suey. Pekin Noodle Parlor also offered takeout and delivery.Hazlett 2013, p. 24 The restaurant installed their first sign in 1916 and added neon some time later. Neon signs became popular after World War I and were used to attract customers.Hazlett 2013, p. 31 Ding Kuen Tam, the grandson of Tam Kwong Lee, left China and came to the U.S. in 1947. He became known as Danny Wong and took over the restaurant business after a few years.  Layout and design  Patrons enter the second floor restaurant from the ground floor on South Main Street, walking up a flight of stairs to a door on the left. The door opens into a hallway with salmon-orange colored beadboard partitions separating 17 eating rooms and booths on either side with privacy curtains for each room. The dining tables and chairs in each room date back to 1916. The central hallway is lined with Chinese lanterns hanging from the ceiling. Servers deliver food to each booth with metal carts.McCumber, David (March 1, 2020). \\"A tradition of hospitality: Pekin Noodle Parlor is a James Beard semifinalist\\". Montana Standard. Retrieved June 21, 2020. The original design, for the first fifty years, was based on a light lime green color scheme with dark green velveteen curtains, not orange. It was repainted to its current orange color after the owner read an article in Bon Appetit magazine that said \\"salmon color whets people's appetites\\".

In the absence of Edward III, Thomas Stewart Earl of Angus together with the Earl of March collected a great number of ships. During the night, they disembarked a group of men-at-arms on the northern side of the Tweed. The next morning, they moved unobserved to the foot of the wall and applied their scaling ladders at the gate. The English who were on guard were quickly overpowered and the townsmen escape to the other gates and abandoned the garrison to the assailants. In the battle Alexander Ogle, Captain of the town, Thomas Percy and Edward Grey were killed on the English side. The Scottish lost Andrew Scott of Balwearie, Thomas Vaux, John Gordon, William St Clair, Thomas Preston, and Alexander Moubray. Aftermath The strategic importance of Berwick pushed the English king, Edward III, to recover it. He arrived at Durham on the 23 December, and attended the remaining soldiers at Newcastle on the 1 January 1356. On 14 January, Edward III marched at the head of his army and his navy laid siege to the town, bringing the English forces to attack by both land and sea. At Berwick Castle Edward III guided the soldiers in person, accompanied by his guards and Sir Walter Manny, one of the most celebrated captains of the time, together advancing a mine on the wall with the help of some miners.

Its main use is containment of flash floods, and as a water supply for the city. It was built in 1976 and is administered by Mexico's (CONAGUA).  Characteristics  Reservoir (2019) The dam has a reservoir capacity of about 3.75 million cubic meters. However, the useful capacity is estimated to be about 2.61 million cubic meters, since the bottom has filled with mud and debris. The area of the reservoir is 54 hectares. The dam is a concrete gravity dam with a length of 200 meters and a maximum height of 34 meters. The width of the crest is 8.5 meters. It has a drop spillway with a maximum drain rate of 30 meters cubic per second. Below the dam there is a water treatment plant with a capacity of 150 liters per second. It takes water from the reservoir and treats it to drinking level to be sent to the distribution network with a pumping system.  Operation  The Emilio Lopez Zamora dam is operated by Mexico's National Water Commission. In 2018 preventive maintenance was carried out on the dam with an investment of 2 million pesos.  History  Built in 1976, it was named for hydraulic engineer Emilio Lopez Zamora, who was the Director of Agriculture in Baja California. The purpose of the dam was to contain flash floods from the local streams and surface runoff, and to supply water to the city. In 1993 an area of 72 hectares was expropriated from the nearby Adolfo Ruiz Cortines community to be part of the reservoir.  Problems and risks = Drought  The contribution from the dam to the water supply is sporadic, because of the irregularity of the Ensenada stream. The dam has reached very low levels of accumulated water, due to poor rainfall during long drought periods, as occurred in 2014, with the dam becoming almost empty in 2015.  Overflow risk  The dam has reached its maximum capacity and activated the spillway on several occasions, most recently in 2019. During the intense rainfall of March 4, 1978, ( in 24 hours), there was an overflow scare and sandbags were placed at the top of the crest. There is uncertainty among the nearby population concerning a potential overflow, with the risks balanced by the fact that the dam did not overflow during the intense rains of 1978, and since then there have not been similar rainfall levels. The real risk of overflowing is increased when the reservoir partially fills with sand and mud due to the lack of dredging.  Garbage and pollution  The dam has been illegally used for dumping raw sewage. This situation has worsened due to the population increase in the neighboring communities, with a construction company reported for illegal spilling. On the surface and the edges, garbage and litter, such as plastic bags and bottles, is visible.  Suicides  In previous years, people have committed suicide by jumping from the dam, until fences were installed to prevent access.  Other community uses  The dam also serves as a vehicular and pedestrian bridge. In the 2002 the Ensenada city council declared the reservoir and surrounding area as an ecological reserve, and in 2007 it was determined to be a protected zone. Plans have been introduced to create a park around the dam or a series of parks from the dam to the ocean following the stream. The reservoir has been used as a training site for competitive kayaking and boating.  Flora and fauna = Vegetation  The vegetation around the dam consists of, in order to distance to the water, marsh (next to the water) with species such as Spartina foliosa and Sarcocornia pacifica; coastal sage scrub, and in the higher areas away from the water coniferous forest type trees such as pines, junipers, and calocedrus.  Fish  Different fish species have been documented in the reservoir, including exotic species such as threadfin shad (Dorosoma petenense), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), western mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), and redbelly tilapia (Tilapia zillii).

After mustering into Confederate service on October 22, 1862, as White's Missouri Infantry, the regiment, as Ponder's Missouri Infantry, fought in the Battle of Prairie Grove on December 7, where it charged the Union lines several times. On May 3, 1863, the regiment was named the 9th Missouri Infantry Regiment, and fought under that name until December 15, 1863, when it was renamed the 12th Missouri Infantry Regiment. On July 4, 1863, the regiment, as part of Brigadier General Mosby M. Parsons' brigade, broke through the Union lines at the Battle of Helena. However, Parsons' flanks were exposed, and the Confederates were driven from the field, suffering heavy losses. After Helena, only 168 men remained in the regiment. On November 22, 1863, the survivors of the regiment were combined into two companies, which were then attached to the 10th Missouri Infantry Regiment, although the 12th Missouri Infantry was still treated as a separate unit for reporting purposes. In April 1864, the 12th Missouri Infantry fought at the battles of Pleasant Hill and Jenkins' Ferry. On September 29, 1864, the survivors of the 12th Missouri Infantry were officially merged into the 10th Missouri Infantry, ending the 12th's separate service career. Background and formation In 1861, at the outbreak of the American Civil War, the state of Missouri, which was strategically located, did not vote to secede despite being a slave state. However, Governor Claiborne F. Jackson, who supported secession, organized like-minded state militia into a camp outside of St. Louis. On May 10, Nathaniel Lyon, a brigadier general in the Union Army, dispersed Jackson's camp, although a riot in St. Louis followed. Jackson responded on May 12 by forming the Missouri State Guard and placing Sterling Price, a major general of state troops, in charge of it. On June 15, Lyon's force moved against the state capital of Jefferson City, causing Jackson and the pro-secession elements of the state legislature to evacuate to Boonville. Lyon took Boonville two days later by forcing out a group of Missouri State Guard soldiers led by Colonel John S. Marmaduke. Price and Jackson then fell back into the southwestern portion of the state. Price then joined forces with Brigadier General Ben McCulloch's Confederate States Army force. In August, the two forces, under the command of McCulloch, were encamped near Springfield. On August 10, Lyon attacked the Confederate camp, in the ensuing Battle of Wilson's Creek, the Union forces were defeated and Lyon killed. After Wilson's Creek, Price and the Missouri State Guard moved north, capturing a Union garrison at Lexington after a siege in September. However, Union forces gathered at Tipton, and Price fell back into southwestern Missouri. In November, Jackson and the pro-secession legislators held a vote approving secession while at Neosho; Missouri joined the Confederate States of America as a government-in-exile. The anti-secession legislators had previously held their own convention in Jefferson City, rejecting secession. In February 1862, Union pressure led Price to leave Missouri for Arkansas, where he joined forces with Major General Earl Van Dorn. In March, Price joined the Confederate States Army, receiving a commission as a major general. Later that month, Van Dorn was defeated at the Battle of Pea Ridge, establishing Union control of Missouri. Most of the men of the Missouri State Guard eventually left the unit to join Confederate States Army formations. Union control of Missouri seemed secure enough that one officer stated that \\"[there was] no Rebel flag now flying in Missouri\\". However, this was disproved when Confederate recruiters and raiders entered the state later that summer. White's Missouri Infantry was first organized in late August 1862 from veterans of the Missouri State Guard. James D. White, the regiment's first colonel, had been authorized to form a regiment for service in the Confederate States Army by Major General Thomas Hindman. The unit was originally based in Pocahontas, Arkansas; it fought in a small skirmish near the town in September. On October 22, the regiment officially entered Confederate service while at Yellville, Arkansas. Willis M. Ponder was the regiment's first lieutenant colonel, and Thomas B. Sandford was the first major. As of the date of muster, the regiment contained 10 companies, designated by the letters AI and K. All were Missouri-raised, except for Company G, which also contained men from Arkansas. Service history=1862 19th-century map of Arkansas, with key locations marked After mustering into Confederate service, the regiment transferred to a camp near Van Buren, Arkansas. The regiment was assigned to Colonel Alexander E. Steen's brigade in November, although Steen was later replaced by Brigadier General Mosby M. Parsons. On November 30, the regiment began moving towards Prairie Grove, Arkansas. Ponder commanded the regiment during the movement, as White was ill. During the early stages of the Battle of Prairie Grove on December 7, the regiment (under the name Ponder's Missouri Infantry) aligned with the rest of Parsons' brigade in a position supporting the Confederate left flank. Late in the battle, Ponder's regiment, along with the rest of Parsons' brigade and Clark's Missouri Infantry Regiment, attacked a Union position. The Confederate attack eventually forced the Union line back, but was halted by Union artillery fire. A further Confederate attack drove back a reformed Union line, with Ponder's regiment and Steen's Missouri Infantry Regiment turning the Union left flank. The Confederates made another attempt against the Union line, but in the advance to attack, Caldwell's Missouri Regiment and Hunter's Missouri Infantry Regiment had their lines of advance cut off by other units, preventing them from joining the charge. Ponder's regiment was on the right of the Confederate attack along with Steen's regiment, but heavy fire from two Union artillery batteries and the 11th Kansas Infantry Regiment repulsed the two regiments. Steen was killed and the two regiments routed, ending the Battle of Prairie Grove. At Prairie Grove, Ponder's regiment suffered 72 casualties. After the defeat at Prairie Grove, the regiment returned to Van Buren. 1863 In January 1863, the regiment transferred from Van Buren to Little Rock, Arkansas. On May 3, the regiment was given the name of 9th Missouri Infantry Regiment by Price's headquarters. By June 11, White had recovered enough from his illness to regain command of the regiment. On July 4, the 9th Missouri Infantry was part of a Confederate assault against a Union force occupying Helena, Arkansas. Parsons' brigade attacked Graveyard Hill and captured it; the regimental flag of the 9th Missouri Infantry was raised over the captured position. However, the brigade's success left both of its flanks exposed, and Union troops were able to concentrate against the brigade. After a five-hour fight, the Confederates were driven back from Graveyard Hill with heavy losses, including many men captured. The 9th Missouri Infantry lost 62 men killed or wounded in the battle; the number of missing men was not reported. Shortly after the battle, the regiment had only 168 men available for duty. Beginning in August, the regiment built fortifications designed to defend Little Rock against Union attack. On August 28, White left the regiment to serve as a provost marshal and was replaced as regiment commander by Ponder, who was promoted to colonel. In September, Union forces advanced against Little Rock, but moved around the Confederate fortifications. In response, the regiment retreated to southern Arkansas without fighting. On November 22, the survivors of the regiment were combined into two companies, which were then attached to the 10th Missouri Infantry Regiment. Despite being attached to the 10th Missouri Infantry, the 9th Missouri Infantry was still treated as a separate regiment for reporting purposes. On December 15, the 9th Missouri Infantry was renamed the 12th Missouri Infantry. 1864 Map of Union movements in the Western Theater; the arrows marked 4 mark the Camden expedition and the Red River campaign In March of 1864, Parsons was elevated to divisional command. Parsons' division contained two brigades: one commanded by Colonel John Bullock Clark Jr. and the other commanded by Colonel Simon P. Burns. As part of Burns' brigade, the 12th Missouri Infantry moved to the support of Major General Richard Taylor in April; Taylor was threatened by a Union advance against Shreveport, Louisiana. The unit reached Taylor's position on April 9, and fought in the Battle of Pleasant Hill later that day. Parsons' division was aligned on the Confederate right flank. Within Parsons' division, Burns' brigade was on the left and Clark's brigade was on the right. The Confederate attack was initially successful, breaking a portion of the Union line. However, a Union flank attack drove back Parsons' line, causing the units to Parsons' left to fall back. The Confederates put up firm resistance at first, but eventually the fighting retreat turned into a rout. However, the Union troops retreated from the field, despite repulsing the Confederate attack. The 12th Missouri Infantry lost 14 men at Pleasant Hill. After a brief rest, the regiment then began moving north towards Camden, Arkansas, which was held by Major General Frederick Steele's Union force. Steele retreated in the face of the Confederate advance, but was caught at the crossing of the Saline River. At the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry on April 30, Parsons' division deployed at around 10:00 a.m., having arrived on the field an hour earlier. Burn's brigade, including the 12th Missouri Infantry, was the left brigade in Parsons' alignment. When Burns' brigade attacked the Union lines, it encountered the 33rd Iowa Infantry and the 12th Kansas Infantry Regiments. Eventually, Burns' brigade was able to outflank the two Union regiments, forcing them to retreat. However, Union reinforcements soon arrived, and a counterattack drove Burns' brigade from the field. Burns' brigade later aligned to support a Texas division, but Steele retreated across the Saline River before Burns' brigade was reengaged. The regiment reported three casualties from the Jenkins' Ferry fighting. Jenkins' Ferry was the 12th Missouri Infantry's last major fight. On September 29, the regiment was officially consolidated into the 10th Missouri Infantry while stationed in Arkansas, ceasing to exist as a separate unit. General Edmund Kirby Smith surrendered the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department on June 2, 1865. On June 8, the men of the 10th Missouri Infantry were paroled at Shreveport; they were later shipped back to Missouri via steamboat.

In 2006, on the occasion 500th anniversary of the foundation of the Guard, the regular band was officially recognized as a special unit of the corps. Duties It officially performs at the pleasure of the Pope, often playing at Papal inaugurations. The Swiss Guard Band annually performs during a Christmas concert on St. Peters Square and all official National Day (24 April) celebrations. In early December 2012, it released a Christmas CD. The funds from its sale benefited two charities in Switzerland and Zimbabwe. It cannot perform outside the Vatican walls without the direct permission of the Secretariat of State. Structure The structure of the Band is as follows: * Maestro (appointed by the guard‚Äôs commandant) * President (responsible for the organization of the band) * Governing Committee * Musicians Because the composition of the musicians always changes every few months, the band does not participate in very many major events during a given year. An example of this is the Federal Music Festival in Montreux, which it participated in for the first time in 25 years in 2016.

The case concerned human rights violations allegedly committed against workers at an Eritrean mine majority-owned by Nevsun Resources, a Canadian firm. The Supreme Court held that the alleged victims' case against Nevsun could proceed in the courts of British Columbia.Nevsun SCC at para 132. It also established that the act of state doctrine is not recognized in Canadian law.Nevsun SCC at para 59.  Background = Mining and human rights  Mining is a significant part of the Canadian economy: approximately 75 percent of the world's mining companies are headquartered in Canada, and 60 percent are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. International expansion of the domestic mining industry has been championed by the Canadian government, and one scholar describes Canadian mining operations as having \\"developed an extensive and indeed dominant global presence.\\" Canadian mining investment abroad has been particularly significant in Latin America and African countries. Researchers have documented a significant number of human rights violations associated with the operations of Canadian-domiciled mining firms abroad.Imai, Shin; Gardner, Leah; Weinberger, Sarah (). \\"The 'Canada Brand': Violence and Canadian Mining Companies in Latin America \\". Osgoode Legal Studies Research Paper No. 17/2017. , Victims of alleged abuses have attempted to challenge these violations in Canada through litigation and administrative means since at least the mid-1990s. Before the Supreme Court's decision in Nevsun, Canadian firms had been described as operating with \\"effective impunity\\" with respect to human rights abuses abroad. In other words, if neither Canadian courts, the courts of the country in which the violation occurred, nor international human rights mechanisms are able to provide victims of human rights abuses with redress, the perpetrators of the violation and the companies who employ them would be able to evade legal accountability.  Legislation and policy developments  The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade of the House of Commons noted such concerns in a June 2005 report. A 2008 report by Oxford's Pro Bono Publico project echoed these observations. The House of Commons report noted that, although Canadian law did not categorically bar claims by alleged victims of human rights abuses abroad, Canadian courts would likely decline to exercise jurisdiction over such claims according to the forum non conveniens doctrine. In Canada, forum non conveniens permits a domestic court to stay an action when it determines that a court in another jurisdiction is \\"clearly\\" the more appropriate forum in which to hear the case.Club Resorts Ltd v Van Breda, 2012 SCC 17 at para 108. Thus, in the mining context, an action in a Canadian court would likely be stayed in favour of the courts of the country in which the alleged abuse occurred. The Martin government failed to implement the House of Commons report's recommendations with respect to domestic law, although it and subsequent governments did advocate for John Ruggie's efforts to enhance corporate responsibility for human rights as Special Representative of the Secretary-General. Subsequent domestic efforts including Bill C-300, which would have created a mechanism to revoke federal funding from companies whose conduct did not conform to human rights and environmental best practices, were defeated. In March 2009, by Order in Council, the federal government implemented a policy document titled \\"Building the Canadian Advantage,\\" which created certain mechanisms to enhance the corporate social responsibility of Canadian firms operating abroad. However, it did not require companies to comply with human rights guidelines.Order in Council PC No. 2009-442 (March 23, 2009). In January 2018, the federal government created the Office of the Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise, a successor to Office of the Extractive Sector Corporate Social Responsibility Counsellor (created by the same Order in Council as that which implemented \\"Building the Canadian Advantage\\"). The Ombudsperson is empowered to investigate alleged human rights violations involving Canadian firms operating outside Canada.  International commitments and obligations  Canada is a member of the International Labor Organization, which condemns forced labour pursuant to the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. It is also party to several treaties that outlaw forced labour and related human rights violations, including slavery and human trafficking.  Decision = Facts  The Bisha Mine in Eritrea, where the Nevsun plaintiffs worked. Nevsun Resources Ltd (Nevsun)‚Äîlater acquired by Zijin Mining‚Äîwas a mining firm incorporated under British Columbia law and headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia. It held a 60 percent stake in Bisha Mining Share Company (BMSC). BMSC was the operating company of Bisha Mine, located in Eritrea.Nevsun SCC at para 7. As the majority owner of BMSC, Nevsun was the parent company of BMSC and BMSC was Nevsun's subsidiary. Several former labourers at the Bisha Mine came to Canada as refugees. In November 2014, they brought a class action against Nevsun in the Supreme Court of British Columbia claiming damages in tort and for breach of customary international law.Nevsun BCSC at para 1. The action was the first Canadian lawsuit alleging violations of customary international law to reach the trial stage. In their complaint, the labourers alleged that they and other members of the proposed class had been subjected to various human rights violations, including \\"the use of forced labour; torture; slavery; cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; and crimes against humanity\\"Nevsun BCSC at para 43. while working at the mine from 2008 to 2012. The workers alleged that they had been engaged by sub- contractors of the mine's operating company under a policy of military conscription in Eritrea known as the National Service Program.Nevsun SCC at paras 8‚Äì9. In addition to requiring military service, the Program also requires conscripts to work on certain infrastructure projects.Nevsun SCC at para 10. Abuses similar to those alleged by the Nevsun plaintiffs have been independently reported by human rights groups including Human Rights Watch. The United Nations has alleged that significant human rights violations have occurred in Eritrea since 1991.  Procedural history  At trial, Nevsun brought a motion to strike the labourers' claim. It made three arguments. First, it argued that Eritrea was the more appropriate forum to hear the claim, based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens.Nevsun BCSC at para 227. Alternatively, it argued that the act of state doctrine‚Äîa doctrine of subject- matter jurisdiction similar to state immunity that has been adopted in a number of common law countries‚Äîprevented the trial court from considering the plaintiffs' claim.Nevsun BCSC at para 341. In the words of one legal scholar, the act of state doctrine \\"extends deference to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs by discouraging, if not outright precluding, courts from adjudicating the legitimacy of a foreign act.\\" Thus, Nevsun submitted, the government of Eritrea‚Äîand not Nevsun‚Äîwas ultimately responsible for the acts giving rise to the plaintiffs' claims. Finally, Nevsun argued that the relevant provisions of customary international law could not apply to corporations.Nevsun BCSC at paras 424‚Äì25. The trial court rejected all three arguments.Nevsun BCSC at para 12. In particular, it held that the act of state doctrine‚Äîalthough, in the trial court's view, it was part of Canadian common law‚Äîwas not engaged in the case. However, the trial court did refuse to certify the class action, meaning that the plaintiffs could only proceed with the suit on their own behalf. On appeal by Nevsun on the other issues, the Court of Appeal largely agreed with the trial court in a unanimous opinion.Nevsun SCC at para 22.  Reasons of the Court  Nevsun further appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court granted Nevsun leave to appeal on June 14, 2018Nevsun Resources Ltd v Araya, 2018 CanLII 53456 (SCC) ‚Äì via CanLII. and heard oral argument on January 23, 2019. Nevsun appealed only on the act of state doctrine and customary international law issues, and not the forum non conveniens point.Nevsun SCC at para 26. The court divided on both issues. Seven of nine judges held that the act of state doctrine was not part of Canadian law. Five held that the plaintiffs' claims based on customary international law could proceed. Thus, the case was remanded back to the Supreme Court of British Columbia to proceed to trial.Nevsun SCC at para 132. = Majority = puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, wrote the majority opinion in Nevsun. Justice Rosalie Abella held for the majority that the claims could proceed. She held that the act of state doctrine is unknown to Canadian law. Rather, Canadian courts treat the two issues covered by the doctrine‚Äînamely, judicial restraint on foreign law matters and the conflict of laws‚Äîseparately.Nevsun SCC at para 44. Justice Abella further held that the plaintiffs' claims based on customary international law could, in principle, ground a private law cause of action in Canadian courts, for several reasons. First, the claims were based on legal principles against forced labour that constitute jus cogens‚Äîbroadly recognized principles of customary international law. Second, Canadian domestic law incorporates international law, via the common law doctrine of adoption, unless the relevant international law norm has been abrogated by statute.See R v Hape, 2007 SCC 26 at para 39. And third, customary international law can bind corporations, and not states alone. However, as the case went to the Supreme Court on a preliminary procedural matter, Justice Abella did not determine whether the Nevsun plaintiffs had in fact established Nevsun's liability for the human rights abuses they had allegedly suffered. She determined only that the case could proceed to trial. In a passage quoted by several commentators, Justice Abella began her opinion as follows: > This appeal involves the application of modern international human rights > law, the phoenix that rose from the ashes of World War II and declared > global war on human rights abuses. Its mandate was to prevent breaches of > internationally accepted norms. Those norms were not meant to be theoretical > aspirations or legal luxuries, but moral imperatives and legal necessities. > Conduct that undermined the norms was to be identified and addressed.Nevsun > SCC at para 1. In conclusion, Justice Abella wrote that: > Customary international law is part of Canadian law. Nevsun is a company > bound by Canadian law. It is not ‚Äúplain and obvious‚Äù to me that the Eritrean > workers‚Äô claims against Nevsun based on breaches of customary international > law cannot succeed. Those claims should therefore be allowed to proceed. = Dissents = Two dissents were filed in the case, one by Justices Russell Brown and Malcolm Rowe and one by Justices Suzanne C√¥t√© and Michael Moldaver. Justices Brown and Rowe dissented only on the customary international law issue,Nevsun SCC at para 135. arguing that corporations cannot be held liable in a civil suit for alleged breaches of international legal norms and that the appropriate remedies for breaches of such norms should be provided for by statute, not the common law. Justices C√¥t√© and Moldaver dissented on both issues.Nevsun SCC at para 267. While they generally agreed with the analysis of Justices Brown and Rowe with respect to the customary international law issue, they would have held that the act of state doctrine did bar to the plaintiffs' claims. All the dissenters critiqued what they saw as the majority's disregard for precedent in recognizing a civil cause of action for breach of international law.Rogge, Malcolm () \\"Nevsun Puts Canada's Corporate Decision Makers in the 'Human Rights Zone'\\". Corporate Responsibility Initiative Working Paper No. 70. Harvard Kennedy School. They noted that \\"[the majority] cites no cases where a corporation has been held civilly liable for breaches of customary international law anywhere in the world, and we do not know of any.\\"Nevsun SCC at para 188.  Commentary  William S. Dodge, a professor at UC Davis School of Law, noted that Nevsun represents part of a \\"trend\\" in which countries around the world, including the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, have opened the door to holding corporations liable in their domestic courts for violations of international law. Lawyers at Norton Rose Fulbright opined that \\"[t]he majority judgment ‚Ä¶ sends a strong signal to the Canadian business community that consideration for human rights norms in all of their activities, whether at home or abroad, must form an integral part of their legal and business planning.\\" Rachel Howie, a partner at Dentons, writing before Nevsun was decided, observed that the plaintiffs' claims in the case were \\"unlike any claim previously determined in Canada,\\" in that they concerned the acts in a foreign country of a corporation‚Äîa private entity‚Äîand not a state.

Its focus for the later centuries, where it is most valuable, is ecclesiastical history. It is written from a Syriac Orthodox perspective. Date, authorship and transmission The Chronicle is found on folios 1‚Äì36, 40 and 41 of a single manuscript, Brit. Mus. Add. MS 14642, which was copied in the early 10th century in Es·π≠rangela script. The copy is a palimpsest: the folios were taken from five different Greek manuscripts, erased and written over. A \\"perfectly distinct work\\", the Chronicle of 813, is bound immediately after it in the codex but was originally a separate manuscript. The original text of the Chronicle of 846 began with Creation, but this part has been lost. The text as it stands begins with the birth of Levi to the Hebrew patriarch Jacob. Owing to damage and loss, there are lacunae in the preserved text for the periods 30 BC‚ÄìAD 37, 230‚Äì275, 431‚Äì449, 540‚Äì574, 582‚Äì601 and 610‚Äì679. The end of the text is not defective. The last event recorded being the ordination of John IV of Antioch in 846, it was probably put in its final form shortly after this date and before John's death in 873. The original chronicle may have ended in 784, before a second compiler extended it with a list of names and dates down to 846. The text's first editor, E. W. Brooks, suggested that, to judge from the number of references to the bishops of ·∏§arrƒÅn, it may have been composed in that location. He later suggested that it may have been written at the monastery of Qar·π≠min, but Ephrem Barsaum points out that the connection to Qar·π≠min derives from the chronicle's reliance on the Chronicle of 819, which probably was composed there. The only surviving copy of the Chronicle of 819 was made by a certain Severus for his uncle David, a monk of Qar·π≠min consecrated bishop of ·∏§arrƒÅn by John IV. Andrew Palmer therefore suggests that the Chronicle of 846 is the work of David, who commissioned his nephew to make a copy of an earlier chronicle for this purpose. Even he is not the main author of the Chronicle of 846, he may be the compiler who extended it from 784 to 846 and interpolated information from the Chronicle of 819. Elsewhere, Palmer suggests that Nonnus of ·∏§arrƒÅn, a monk of Qar·π≠min who became bishop of ·π¨ur  øAbdin shortly before 845, may have been the final redactor of the Chronicle of 846. Sources, content and structure The Chronicle is a series of chronologically ordered short notices, typically preceded by the year given in the Seleucid era. The early, universal part relies on the Chronicle of Eusebius of Caesarea. The later sections are local in character and rely on non-universal chronicles, as well as lists of bishops and the canons of church councils. For the 5th and 6th centuries its focus is ecclesiastical history. Among its sources are the Ecclesiastical History of John of Ephesus, the Ecclesiastical History of Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor, the lost chronicle of Jacob of Edessa and the Teaching of Addai. It also shares sources with the Melkite Chronicle of 641 and the Chronicle of Edessa. For the 7th and 8th centuries, after the rise of Islam, it depends upon the Chronicle of 819. For the period 679‚Äì784, the Chronicle of 846 is uncharacteristically political in describing events in the Byzantine Empire and the Islamic Caliphate. Its account of this period is generally independent of any other surviving source. Down to 728 it is primarily a political history, but from 734 it reverts to ecclesiastical history with caliphal notices. The final section contains a list of caliphs from 784 until the reign of al-Ma æm≈´n (813‚Äì833), but does not mention his death, and a list of Syriac Orthodox patriarchs of Antioch from 784 until 846. The Chronicle of 846 overlaps with certain works that depend on the same sources, such as the Chronicle of Zuqnin (775) and the works of Theophanes the Confessor (9th century), Michael the Syrian (12th century) and Bar Hebraeus (13th century). It does contain unique material not found elsewhere, almost entirely for the periods 574‚Äì582, 601‚Äì610 and 679‚Äì846. These include the exactions of the Arab governors of Iraq and an otherwise unknown bishop of Edessa, Athanasius, around 750. As befits its Syriac Orthodox point of view, the Chronicle is hostile to the Byzantine emperor Leo III the Isaurian and favourable to the Caliph  øUmar. Its account of the campaign of SharƒÅ·∏•ƒ´l ibn  øUbayda against the Bulgars during the siege of Constantinople (717‚Äì718) may be derived from an Arabic source.

His run lasted from May 15 to July 16, during which he had a .408 batting average. DiMaggio's streak surpassed the single-season record of 44 consecutive games that had been held by Willie Keeler since 1897, and the longest streak spanning multiple seasons, also accomplished by Keeler. The record set by DiMaggio still exists and has been described as unbreakable. Background DiMaggio began his professional career in 1933 with the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). That season, he had hits in 61 straight games, breaking the PCL record of 49 games that had been held by Jack Ness.Kennedy, pp. 293‚Äì296. That streak is the second-longest in the history of Minor League Baseball, behind a 69-game streak by Joe Wilhoit, and remains a PCL record. After joining the Yankees in 1936, DiMaggio became the club's center fielder and was a member of World Series-winning teams in each of his first four major league seasons. In 1940, however, the Yankees failed to top the American League (AL) for the first time in DiMaggio's career, despite his league- leading .352 batting average,Castro, p. 30. and a 23-game hitting streak that was the longest in MLB that season. The Yankees got off to a mediocre start in 1941, and were mired in fourth place in the middle of May. DiMaggio went through a batting slump in which he hit only .194 over a 20-game period.Cramer, p. 159. Entering the 1941 season, the major league record for the longest hitting streak in a season was held by Willie Keeler, who had hits in 44 straight National League (NL) games in 1897. Keeler also had the longest hitting streak when multiple-season runs were included; he had recorded a hit in the final game of the 1896 season before beginning the following year with the 44-game stretch. The AL record was held by George Sisler, who had a 41-game streak in 1922, one game longer than a 40-game Ty Cobb streak in 1911. The streak=Opening games On May 15, in the first inning of a game against the Chicago White Sox, DiMaggio hit a run-scoring single off of White Sox pitcher Eddie Smith. The Yankees did not score again for the rest of the contest and lost 13‚Äì1. In the following day's game, DiMaggio hit a home run and a triple in a win for New York, before a 3‚Äì2 defeat to the White Sox in which DiMaggio managed one single in four plate appearances.Kennedy, p. 24. The St. Louis Browns were the Yankees' opponents in their next series, and in their first game DiMaggio was credited with three hits in as many at-bats despite making weak contact each time. Browns catcher Frank Grube committed catcher's interference by contacting DiMaggio's bat with his glove during a swing, which resulted in a hit being awarded; the others came as a result of defensive miscues. In the subsequent two games against the Browns, DiMaggio had one hit apiece, waiting until the late innings to extend his streak on each occasion. At the time, he did not own the longest hitting streak on the Yankees; Bill Dickey had an active run of 21 consecutive games with at least one hit.Cramer, pp. 162‚Äì163. The Detroit Tigers opposed New York in a two-game series; DiMaggio had a hit in each game, recording one in the seventh inning of the second game. Against the Boston Red Sox, he waited even longer to extend the streak to nine games, as it took him until his last at-bat of the contest in the eighth inning to hit a single.Cramer, p. 163. DiMaggio had a single that scored two runs in the subsequent game, a 7‚Äì6 Yankees win, before a 10‚Äì3 loss in which he singled off Red Sox pitcher Lefty Grove in the first inning.Kennedy, p. 58. In Washington, D.C. on May 27, his run reached 12 games against the Senators with a four-hit performance. DiMaggio contributed a 425-foot home run, which plated two baserunners, and three singles in a 10‚Äì8 Yankees victory. The following contest between the teams was the first night game ever held at Washington's Griffith Stadium. DiMaggio was held hitless until the eighth inning, when he tripled to begin a five-run Yankees rally that led to a one-run win.Seidel, pp. 90‚Äì93. First press coverage DiMaggio faced Cleveland Indians starting pitcher Bob Feller multiple times during the streak. By the time the streak reached 13 games, it started receiving attention in the New York City press. Sportswriter Dan Daniel made note of the run on May 28 in the New York World-Telegram; one day later, Jack Smith mentioned the streak after it had reached 14 games. DiMaggio had reached base on a single in the fourth inning against the Senators; after hitting the ball off home plate, he narrowly reached first base ahead of the fielder's throw, according to teammate Johnny Sturm. Although DiMaggio added a single in the sixth inning, that hit was expunged from the record books when rain forced the game to be stopped. Only at-bats from the first five innings counted in the records, meaning that the fourth-inning hit was required to extend the streak.Seidel, p. 9. Author Michael Seidel called the game \\"one of the closest calls for DiMaggio during the streak\\".Seidel, p. 93. The Red Sox hosted New York in a doubleheader at Fenway Park on May 30. In his first three plate appearances, DiMaggio had two walks and made an out, and the game entered the ninth inning with him still needing a hit to continue the streak. He came up to bat second in the inning, and singled as part of a three-run rally that brought the Yankees back from a 3‚Äì1 deficit to win. They lost the second game 13‚Äì0, as DiMaggio concluded the day having made four fielding errors during the two games. However, the second game was his 16th in a row with a hit, as a weak fly ball off his bat in the fifth inning eluded Red Sox outfielder Pete Fox for a double.Seidel, pp, 97‚Äì100. The Yankees traveled to Cleveland for a series against the Indians, who topped the AL standings at the time. After a postponement due to rain, the teams played a doubleheader, which the Yankees swept. DiMaggio recorded a single in the first game and a hit off Indians pitcher Mel Harder in the second. Bob Feller was the opposing starter for the Indians in the final game of the series. Although the Yankees lost 7‚Äì5, DiMaggio's run continued with two hits off Feller‚Äîa single and a double.Kennedy, pp. 74‚Äì75. Following this game, in an early press mention of the streak, The New York Times made reference to DiMaggio's run in its report. On June 2, DiMaggio's streak reached 20 games when he homered in a 4‚Äì2 Yankees loss in Detroit.Cramer, p. 165. Another Yankees loss followed in the second and final game of that series, but DiMaggio tripled in the sixth inning. He was beginning to approach his longest major league hitting streak, the 23-game run he had accomplished in 1940. In St. Louis, DiMaggio singled three times in an 11‚Äì7 win for the Yankees, stretching the streak to 22 games. One day after that game, the teams played a doubleheader in which DiMaggio starred. He had a pair of home runs in the first game; in the second game, which lasted only seven innings due to darkness, he added another home run and hit a double off the fence in right field.Kennedy, p. 98. On June 10, the Yankees played in Chicago against the White Sox, winning 8‚Äì3. DiMaggio was held hitless until the seventh inning, when he sent the ball on a bounce to third baseman Dario Lodigiani, who failed to handle it. The official scorer ruled the play a hit, extending DiMaggio's run to 25 games.Seidel, p. 122. Following a rainout the next day, DiMaggio successfully recorded a hit for the 26th straight game in the fourth inning, with a single to center field. Having previously kept the streak alive, he proceeded to hit a home run in the tenth inning, which eventually gave the Yankees another victory.Seidel, p. 125. The team returned to Yankee Stadium for a series with the Indians, and Feller was the opposing starting pitcher in their first game. After a walk in his first plate appearance, DiMaggio took three balls from Feller, then opted to swing at the next pitch instead of trying to draw a walk. He made contact, sending a double to right-center field which brought his run to 27 games.Kennedy, pp. 109‚Äì111. In the following game, DiMaggio only needed to wait until the third inning to extend his run, hitting a home run to left field. The homer brought him to within one game of tying the franchise record for the longest hitting streak, which was held by Earle Combs and Roger Peckinpaugh. On June 16, DiMaggio matched their mark with a fifth-inning double.Seidel, pp. 132‚Äì135. Close calls against Chicago and St. Louis The following game, in which the Yankees played against the White Sox, featured a ruling by official scorer Dan Daniel that impacted DiMaggio's streak. In the seventh inning, DiMaggio came up to the plate without a hit in the game. He sent a ground ball to White Sox shortstop Luke Appling; before reaching Appling, the ball hopped off Appling and DiMaggio reached base. Daniel ruled the play a hit, extending the streak to 30. The play ended up being his only hit in an 8‚Äì7 Yankees loss,Kennedy, pp. 121‚Äì124. and gave DiMaggio the longest hitting streak in Yankees history.Cramer, p. 167. A weakly hit ball produced another hit in the next game. Appling fielded it, but not in time to throw DiMaggio out.Seidel, p. 139. DiMaggio brought the streak to 32 games with a home run and a pair of singles against the White Sox.Kennedy, p. 145. The Tigers were the Yankees' next opponents, and in the first inning of the opening game of their series, DiMaggio quickly extended the streak by hitting a single. In a 14‚Äì4 New York win, he added a double and two more singles. DiMaggio later said that this was when he began to consider the possibility of achieving the longest MLB hitting streak.Seidel, p. 146. Again, DiMaggio added to his stretch of hits in the first inning of the next game, and his single brought the run to 34 games.Kennedy, p. 152. A home run off Tigers pitcher Hal Newhouser in the sixth inning of the teams' June 22 contest extended it further. By this point, sportswriters had begun to take a keen interest in DiMaggio's streak, as newspapers started running headlines reporting on the topic.Kennedy, pp. 146, 167. On June 24, DiMaggio went hitless in his first three at-bats against the St. Louis Browns, leading to an eighth-inning plate appearance in which he needed a hit for the streak to reach 36 games. As those in attendance chanted \\"We want a hit\\", he singled to bring him within five games of Sisler's modern record. The single came off of pitcher Bob Muncrief, who ignored instructions to walk DiMaggio by St. Louis manager Luke Sewell. The next day, DiMaggio achieved an earlier continuation of the streak by homering in the fourth inning, his ninth home run in 20 games.Seidel, p. 157. He did not record a hit until his last at-bat against the Browns on June 26, this time doubling during his final opportunity to stretch his run, which stood at 38 games.Seidel, p. 161. Regarding the prospect of nearing the hitting streak record, DiMaggio had previously said to the press, \\"I'm not thinking a whole lot about it. ... I'll either break it or I won't.\\" After this game, though, he publicly expressed a desire to top Sisler's 1922 run. Nearing the MLB hitting streak record The Yankees traveled to Philadelphia for a series with the Athletics; in the first game, DiMaggio only needed one pitch in his first at-bat to record a single, and later added a home run.Kennedy, p. 206. The starting pitcher opposing the Yankees in the next game was Johnny Babich, who DiMaggio had faced during his 61-game PCL hitting streak. Babich told the local press that he would end DiMaggio's streak by getting him out in his first plate appearance and not giving him hittable pitches afterwards. Babich induced a popout in DiMaggio's first at-bat, and in the third inning threw him three unhittable pitches to begin his next plate appearance. The fourth pitch by Babich was well outside the strike zone, but DiMaggio made a lunging swing and guided the ball between Babich's legs; he ended up with a double which he said left Babich \\"white as a sheet.\\"Cramer, pp. 170‚Äì171.Kennedy, p. 209. In the future, DiMaggio referred to this as \\"the most satisfying hit of the streak\\". Surpassing Sisler and Keeler DiMaggio holding his bat after the end of the streak. Upon a return trip to Washington, a crowd of 31,000 packed into Griffith Stadium to follow DiMaggio's chase during a doubleheader, nearly 30,000 more than had attended the previous game between the Senators and Yankees.Kennedy, p. 214. Against Senators starting pitcher Dutch Leonard, DiMaggio flied out to center field in his first at-bat and popped out to third base in his second. His third at-bat, in the sixth inning, saw DiMaggio swing at one pitch and miss before taking a ball; on the third pitch, he struck a double to left-center field.Kennedy, pp. 218‚Äì220. DiMaggio encountered an unexpected obstacle as he prepared to hit in the second game; his favorite bat had gone missing. It was stolen from the Yankees' dugout, which forced him to use a less-preferred bat. He recorded outs in each of his first three at-bats, and came up again in the seventh inning. For this at-bat, he followed a recommendation by teammate Tommy Henrich to use his bat, which DiMaggio had originally given to him. On the second pitch, DiMaggio singled to pass Sisler. The missing bat was eventually found and returned to him before the Yankees' contest on July 5.Kennedy, pp. 221‚Äì223, 278.Seidel, p. 172. Although the press ran stories on DiMaggio passing Sisler's modern-day record and the achievement received fan acclaim, newspapers had discussed the longer mark set by Keeler in some prior accounts, and DiMaggio had been made aware of Keeler's run by a reporter. The Yankees faced the Red Sox in a doubleheader, with DiMaggio in position to tie Keeler's single-season record with hits in each game.Kennedy, pp. 226‚Äì228. In front of 53,000 spectators at Yankee Stadium, he popped out in the first inning and grounded out in the third. Two innings later, DiMaggio and pitcher Mike Ryba battled to a full count, before DiMaggio hit a high chopper that never left the infield. Red Sox third baseman Jim Tabor fielded the ball, but his throw was off-target as a hustling DiMaggio reached first base. Daniel ruled the play a hit, extending the streak. It was the first of two hits for DiMaggio in the game, which the Yankees won 7‚Äì2. In the second game of the doubleheader, he quickly tied Keeler's 44-game run with a first- inning single.Kennedy, pp. 228‚Äì237. On July 2, DiMaggio attempted to break Keeler's record for the longest single-season MLB hitting streak, against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. His first at-bat nearly produced a record-breaking hit, but Red Sox outfielder Stan Spence made a leaping catch to temporarily deny him the mark. Following a groundout in the third inning, DiMaggio batted again in the fifth and hit a home run to left field, which gave him MLB's longest single-season hitting streak at 45 games.Seidel, p. 179. After the Yankees' next game was postponed due to rain, the team next played on July 5 against the Athletics, and DiMaggio wasted no time lengthening his streak to 46 games; in the first inning, he hit another home run.Seidel, p. 186. Extending the record to 56 games The Yankees played the Athletics in a doubleheader on July 6, with the first game featuring a rematch between DiMaggio and Babich. This time, Babich was unable to utilize his attempted strategy from their previous encounter, as DiMaggio singled off of him in the first inning. He added a double and two more singles later in the game, as part of an 8‚Äì4 Yankees victory. In the second game, DiMaggio tripled in his initial at-bat to run the streak to 48 games; a third-inning double gave him his sixth hit during the doubleheader.Seidel, p. 190. Following a break for the All-Star Game, the Browns opposed the Yankees in St. Louis on July 10. In the first inning of a contest stopped in the sixth inning by rain, he hit a bouncer to Browns shortstop Alan Strange, who knocked the ball down but was unable to make an attempt to throw out DiMaggio, who was credited with a hit.Seidel, pp. 190‚Äì193. In his attempt to reach the 50-game mark, DiMaggio had four hits against the Browns the following day, including a ninth-inning home run and three singles.Seidel, p. 197. He subsequently secured a double in the fourth inning of the teams' game one day later, before the Yankees traveled to Chicago for a doubleheader against the White Sox. DiMaggio recorded three hits in the opening contest and a single in the second, bringing the streak to 53 games.Kennedy, p. 289. The next day, DiMaggio hit a popup to center field, which was mishandled by White Sox second baseman Bill Knickerbocker. Despite the protestations of DiMaggio's teammates, the play was scored as an error on Knickerbocker. In his second plate appearance, DiMaggio was required to bring a new bat to the plate, as he had broken one while swinging at the popup. He walked, and saw two balls to start his at-bat in the sixth inning. He then hit a weak grounder to third base, and beat the throw to first base for a hit.Kennedy, pp. 298‚Äì299. The Yankees again played against the White Sox on July 15, facing Eddie Smith, against whom DiMaggio had recorded his first hit of the streak in May. In his first chance to extend his run to 55 games, DiMaggio hit a ground ball to Chicago shortstop Appling, who committed a fielding error. He again hit a ground ball in the direction of Appling in the third inning, but it eluded him for a hit. It was the first of two for DiMaggio in a 5‚Äì4 Yankees win, as he doubled as well. The next day, at Cleveland's League Park, DiMaggio hit a single to center field in the first inning to run the streak to 56 games; later in the game, he added another single and a double. Seidel wrote that \\"DiMaggio's three hits were representative of the range of the streak as a whole: one clean, one a little lucky, and one driven hard and far.\\"Seidel, p. 204. End of the streak On July 17, the Yankees again faced the Indians in Cleveland, this time at Municipal Stadium. Against left-handed Indians starting pitcher Al Smith, DiMaggio hit a sharp ground ball down the third base foul line in his first at-bat, but was denied a hit by Indians third baseman Ken Keltner, who managed to field the ball and throw DiMaggio out. Smith walked DiMaggio in his next plate appearance, drawing boos from the Cleveland fans.Cramer, p. 185. DiMaggio sent another grounder down the line at third base in the seventh; for the second time in the game, Keltner fielded the ball backhanded and his throw beat DiMaggio to first base. An inning later, DiMaggio approached the plate with one more opportunity to record a hit in his 57th straight contest, as the Yankees led 4‚Äì1. With the bases loaded, he faced right-handed pitcher Jim Bagby Jr., who had just been inserted in relief duties. He hit a ground ball to shortstop Lou Boudreau, which took a hop before reaching him. Regardless, Boudreau successfully fielded the ball and turned a double play, which denied DiMaggio a hit. In the bottom of the ninth inning, the Indians staged a late rally to get within 4‚Äì3 and placed a runner at third base with no outs, which created the potential for DiMaggio to bat again in extra innings if Cleveland could tie the score. Yankees reliever Johnny Murphy stopped the Indians from plating the tying run, however, bringing an end to DiMaggio's streak. Reaction and statistical summary Despite receiving little press coverage in its early days, the streak ultimately gained significant attention from the media and baseball fans. It served as a distraction at a time when World War II was ongoing in Europe; author Richard Ben Cramer wrote that it \\"gave America just what it needed: something apart from woe and war to talk about‚Äîa summer craze.\\"Cramer, pp. 160‚Äì163. Fan enthusiasm continued climbing even after DiMaggio had set the record, as large crowds filled stadiums to follow his exploits. ESPN's Jayson Stark has described DiMaggio's achievement as \\"the coolest, most romantic record in sports.\\" Author Maury Allen considered the streak a \\"crossover event\\" that raised awareness of DiMaggio among the general population and gave him increased respect from baseball fans.Kennedy, p. 313. As of 2019, the mark DiMaggio set in 1941 remains intact. Various analysts have called the record unbreakable. Among the factors cited as making the streak difficult to surpass are a decreasing emphasis on high batting averages for hitters, a higher number of relief pitchers used by teams, and mounting media attention and pressure as lengthy hitting streaks develop. One factor cited by sportswriters in 1941 to explain the streak was DiMaggio's bat control; over the length of his run; he struck out only five times.Cramer, p. 181. During the 56 games that encompassed his 1941 hitting streak, DiMaggio had 91 base hits in 223 at-bats for a .408 average. He had 55 runs batted in during the period, and his hit count included 15 home runs. His 56 runs scored matched the number of games in his streak.Seidel, p. 220. In the final 11 games, DiMaggio had a .545 average, with 24 hits in 44 at-bats.Seidel, p. 204. DiMaggio faced the Browns and White Sox 12 times each during the streak, the most of any AL opponent. The Athletics and Senators were his least common foes, with the Yankees having played each team five times; however, DiMaggio had his highest batting average against the Athletics, hitting .524 against them. The Yankees moved up significantly in the AL standings during the streak. Before it started, they were five-and-a-half games out of first place in the AL. By the time it ended, the Yankees had improved to 56‚Äì27 for the season and were on top of the AL by seven games over the Indians. Their record during the streak was 41‚Äì13, with two ties. Aftermath In the game after the streak was snapped, DiMaggio recorded two hits off Feller. He posted at least one base hit in each of the following 15 games as well; the streak- breaking contest was the only one in a 73-game span in which he did not have a hit. The Yankees won the AL pennant by a 17-game margin and defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1941 World Series. DiMaggio was voted the Most Valuable Player in the AL, beating out Ted Williams, who batted over .400 for the season.Cramer, pp. 186‚Äì189. Subsequent challenges Four seasons after DiMaggio's streak, in 1945, Tommy Holmes of the Boston Braves had hits in 37 consecutive games to break the post-1900 NL record; it was the longest hitting streak in that league since Keeler's. The longest hitting streak in MLB from 1946 to 1977 was accomplished by DiMaggio's brother Dom, who had a 34-game run in 1949; no other player exceeded 31 games. In 1978, Pete Rose made a sustained challenge for the record, with base hits in 44 straight contests to tie Keeler's single-season mark in 1897. Nine years later, Paul Molitor came within 17 games of the record, topping out at 39 games. Since 2000, no player has equaled the streaks of Rose or Molitor. From 2005 to 2006, Jimmy Rollins of the Philadelphia Phillies came the closest, recording hits in 38 consecutive games. The longest single-season streaks were posted by Luis Castillo in 2002 and Chase Utley in 2006, each of whom had a 35-game streak.

She wrote the column Dis 'n' Dat for the Delta Democrat Times in Greenville and The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, where she commented on political, social, and economic issues in the United States. A member of a prominent Mississippi family, Ogden was an active member of multiple women's organizations including the Daughters of the American Revolution and the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and was a founding member of Women for Constitutional Government. She used her social influence to organize conservative political movements in Mississippi, promote women's involvement in politics, and defend white supremacy. Ogden was an avid supporter of the White Citizens' Councils, criticized liberal shifts in the National Council of Churches, opposed immigration reform, and publicly denounced the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. A Dixiecrat, she pushed for conservative agendas within the Democratic Party and contributed to the Republican Party's shift to political and cultural dominance in the Deep South.  Early life and family  Ogden was born on October 2, 1891 to Walter Sillers, Sr. and his second wife, Florence Warfield Sillers. She was the sister of Walter Sillers Jr., a white nationalist and politician who served as the Speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives. A member of an aristocratic Mississippi Delta family, her paternal grandparents were planters and slaveholders operating cotton plantations in Rosedale. Her father's family descended from Scottish colonists from Perthshire, who settled in North Carolina prior to the American Revolutionary War. Her mother was a daughter of Colonel Elisha Warfield, who served in the 2nd Arkansas Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War. On her mother's side, she was a great-great- granddaughter of the physician Elisha Warfield and a great-grandniece of suffragist and abolitionist Mary Jane Warfield Clay. Ogden's father helped engineer the disfranchisement of African-Americans in Mississippi in the 1890s and her mother was a prominent socialite who authored a book on the history of Bolivar County that glorified the Antebellum South and the Confederate States of America.  Career and political activism Ogden earned a reputation as a political columnist in the 1930s, writing her own column titled Dis 'n' Dat. Her writing appeared in the Delta Democrat Times and The Clarion-Ledger. She reported on agricultural issues, economic policies, society events, political happenings, and criticized liberal politicians. Like her mother, Ogden was a leader in her local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, where she networked with other society women and led a movement to celebrate and preserve Mississippi's Confederate history. She also became an active member of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. She was a supporter of the New Deal, implemented by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, for the aid it brought to Mississippi. In 1948 Ogden spoke at a Dixiecrat gathering of eight hundred women, urging women to become more active in American politics. She reportedly stated, \\"We, the women, have a big stake in theses issues.\\" In 1952 she publicly expressed her disappointment and frustration with Mississippi's male political leaders who had voted for Adlai Stevenson, a liberal politician, to represent the Democrats as the party's presidential nominee. Ogden then endorsed Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Republican presidential nominee, and formed a chapter of Democrats for Eisenhower in Bolivar County declaring, \\"now I've got to elect Ike all by myself‚Äîwith the help of the women.\\" Although Ogden insisted that her work was inspired by conservative principles and not racial issues, her activism coincided with key moments of the Civil Rights Movement and opposed the overturning of Jim Crow laws. She was an outspoken supporter of racial segregation and defended white supremacy. In 1954 she opposed the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, ending segregation in public schools, calling it \\"the most outrageous seizure of power in all the history of our country, worthy of Stalin and Russia.\\" Ogden was a staunch supporter of the White Citizens' Councils, a network of white supremacists. In 1962 she helped found Women for Constitutional Government, an organization born out of the Ole Miss riot of 1962, which occurred when the University of Mississippi decided to integrate. Ogden served as a keynote speaker at the organization's inaugural meeting in Jackson, which was attended by almost two thousand women. In her speech, Ogden called for a return to constitutional and judicial conservatism. The organization would later oppose the United States' participation in the United Nations and campaigned against the Equal Rights Amendment. Ogden accused churches in the Southern United States of \\"falling right into the Communist plan\\" after the National Council of Churches was founded. Odgen felt that Communism and liberalism were synonymous, and saw liberalism as a threat to traditional Protestant Christian values. She openly opposed liberalizing immigration policy, and was part of a grassroots movement to defend the existing government approach to immigration, based on the Immigration Act of 1924, which favored Western European immigrants over immigrants from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. She believed that the existing system protected the American way of life.  Personal life and death  She married Harry Cline Ogden of Chicago on June 29, 1911. They had no children. She died on June 23, 1971 in Beulah, Mississippi.

Scoffield is an American microbiologist and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Microbiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine. Scoffield studies the mechanisms by which oral commensal bacteria interfere with pathogenic bacterial growth in order to inform the development of active therapeutic tools to prevent drug resistant pathogen infection. In 2019, Scoffield became the Inaugural Recipient of the American Association for Dental Research Procter and Gamble Underrepresented Faculty Research Fellowship.  Early life and education  Scoffield grew up in Chattanooga, Tennessee. She pursued her undergraduate degree at Tuskegee University in 1998, which is when she discovered her passion for biomedical research. Scoffield graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Biological Sciences in 2002. Following her undergraduate degree, Scoffield stayed at Tuskegee University to complete her Masters of Science in Biology. While at Tuskegee, Scoffield helped to design plant growth systems for space missions and then helped develop edible vaccines using plants. She explored the use of Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer efficiency in sweet potato cultivars, in an effort to improve sweet potato production in Alabama. She presented this emerging technology at the In Vitro Cellular and Developmental Biology Symposium. She completed her Master‚Äôs training in 2004. Following her masters, Scoffield pursued her graduate training at Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama. She trained under Laura Silo-Suh in the Department of Biological Sciences and she explored the mechanisms by which Pseudomonas aeruginosa growth mechanisms and virulence factor production. P. aeruginosa infections are one of the leading causes of chronic pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis patients, often resulting in mortality. Her work helped to explore which environmental factors and adaptations lead to persistent and severe infection in CF patients. Probing the metabolic glyoxylate pathways of P. aeruginosa, Scoffield found that isocitrate lyase, an important enzyme in the glyoxylate pathway, facilitated adaptation of P. aeruginosa to the CF lung. They also found that the glyoxylate pathway becomes up-regulated in specific bacterial isolates from CF patient lungs. Based on this finding, Scoffield explored the genetic mechanisms of pathway up-regulation and she showed that GlpR, a transcriptional repressor for glycerol metabolism, also regulates the glyoxylate pathway, shedding light on the interactions between fatty acid and glycerol metabolism in PO. aeruginosa. Scoffield completed her PhD in microbiology in 2012.  Career and research  After completing her PhD training, Scoffield pursued her postdoctoral training at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. She trained under the mentorship of Hui Wu in the Department of Pediatric Dentistry. Scoffield continued to study P. aeruginosa, but focused on its infection of the oral cavity. She explored how commensal bacteria in the mouth help to suppress P. aeruginosa infection. She found that commensal bacteria in the oral cavity suppress the growth and infection of pathogenic P. aeruginosa through their release of nitrate and H202. This work suggests that H202 and nitrate may present an infection treatment strategy in patients with P. aeruginosa infections. Scoffield then found that P. aeruginosa require nitrite reductase to survive in the presence of nitrite producing commensal oral bacteria. In 2018, Scoffield was appointed to Assistant Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham in the Department of Microbiology. She also holds secondary appointments in the Department of Medicine Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care, as well as an appointment in the Department of Pediatric Dentistry. Scoffield also works in the Cystic Fibrosis Research Center. Scoffield is a member of the American Society for Microbiology as well as the American Association for Dental Research (AADR). In 2019, she became the inaugural recipient of the AADR Procter and Gamble Under-represented Faculty Research Fellowship. Scoffield is also the principal investigator of the Scoffield Lab. Her lab explores the role of commensal bacteria in maintaining homeostasis. The lab focuses on both oral and pulmonary commensal bacteria and how these bacteria are able to control and suppress pathogenic bacteria in these niches. The main pathogenic bacteria the Scoffield Lab explores are Streptococcus mutans, the major cause of pathogenic oral infection, and P. aeruginosa, the major cause of pulmonary infection in CF patients. In 2019, Scoffield and her team explored how P. aeruginosa infection of microglia impacts extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis and composition. The team found that P. aeruginosa infection and treatment of microglia with P. aeruginosa EVs altered protein and mRNA expression in microglia derived EVs and led to decreased cell viability. These findings suggest that EVs alone could be used as a biomarker of infection and guide the development of tools to target resistant bacteria.

She has been portrayed in film, television, plays, novels, songs, poems, and other creative forms many times, and as a result, she has stayed very much in popular memory. Dame Ellen Terry as Catherine of Aragon In art and media The first episode of The Six Wives of Henry VIII, is told from her point of view (and in which she is portrayed by Annette Crosbie). Charlotte Hope plays her in the STARZ mini-series The Spanish Princess, which is based on the book The Constant Princess by Philippa Gregory. William Shakespeare's play Henry VIII succeeds in recreating with great accuracy Catherine's statement about the legitimacy of her marriage at the court in Blackfriars before King Henry, and Shakespeare's portrayal of Catherine is remarkably sympathetic; however, most of the rest of the play is an attempt to absolve many, especially Henry VIII, and the timing of key incidents (including Catherine's death) is changed and other events are avoided (the play makes Henry nearly an innocent pawn in the hands of a dastardly Cardinal Wolsey, and the play stops short of Anne Boleyn's execution). In January 2013, the National Portrait Gallery in London revealed that its curators had recently discovered that a portrait at Lambeth Palace formerly believed to have been a portrait of Catherine Parr in fact shows Catherine of Aragon. The National Portrait Gallery announced that the painting, which had hung in a private sitting room of the Archbishop of Canterbury since at least the 19th century, would be paired with a portrait of Henry VIII already in the museum's collection, and would remain at the museum on loan.
