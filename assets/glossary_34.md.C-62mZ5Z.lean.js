History John Acraman was born in England, a son of William Edward Acraman (c. 1800 ‚Äì 27 November 1875) and Mary Acraman (c. 1801 ‚Äì 9 February 1871) of Sidmouth, Devon, England. Theirs was an old and honorable Somersetshire family, whose surname was formerly spelled Akerman, or Ackerman. John's grandfather Daniel Wade Acraman, a Bristol businessman, was a noted connoisseur of art. This article gives father William Edward Acraman's life span as 1790‚Äì1875 John Acraman's early days were spent at Bath, Somerset and Clifton, Bristol, and he was educated in both places. His father was a wealthy merchant and industrialist, owner of several East India ships. At Bristol he was nominally apprenticed to his father, in order that he might qualify for membership of the prestigious Society of Merchant Venturers. His eldest brother Edward Daniel Acraman (c. 1825 ‚Äì 20 January 1848) emigrated to Adelaide aboard Kingston, arriving in January 1846, and formed a partnership with James Cooke. Urged by his brother to join him, John sailed from Bristol aboard Appleton consigned to Acraman, Cooke, & Co., arriving at the Semaphore in April 1848. He carried letters of introduction to Mr. Justice Cooper, John Morphett and Samuel Davenport, (all of whom were subsequently knighted) given him by Charles Sturt, who had returned to England in 1847 by that same Appleton.. John walked to Port Adelaide, where he met Captain Scott from whom he received news of the recent death of his brother. He immediately made his way to the house of his uncle Edward Castle, of \\"Hackham\\" at Morphett Vale, and there met among others (afterwards Justice) Edward Castres Gwynne and Edward Klingender. He opened an office in Flinders Street and took on James Cooke as partner in Acraman, Cooke & Co. For months he boarded with R. E. Tapley in Gilbert Street, then moved to the more convenient Clarendon Hotel in Hindley Street. He was next in a boarding house kept by Robert Hall, Adelaide's first daguerrotypist. Among his fellow-boarders were G. W. Hawkes, Erasmus Gower and George Green, the auctioneer. In 1851 he visited India, but while in Calcutta heard news of the Victorian gold finds, and returned to Adelaide. The firm was able to capitalize on the increased demand, and made huge profits despite the shortage of staff, most able-bodied men having joined the rush. The firm opened a temporary branch in Melbourne, managed by James Cooke, and an office in Bendigo under Archibald Cooke. They purchased River Murray steamboats, which while the Murray was in flood proved the most efficient way of servicing the goldfields, and bullock teams and wagons, though not without risk: one bullock driver sold the dray, team and load, and was never seen again. A shipment of gold was lost when the Madagascar vanished without trace in 1853. Acraman and Randolph Isham Stow in 1853 decided to start housekeeping together, and purchased a house adjoining the Green Dragon Brewery on South Terrace from Alfred Watts, with an agreement that whichever of them married first should have the option of taking over the house and furniture. This proved to be Acraman, who married Sydney Sarah Knox on 17 October 1854 at Christ Church, North Adelaide. She had been a passenger on the Grecian, which was wrecked off Port Adelaide in 1850. The couple spent twelve months in the United Kingdom, and their second son, Harold Arthur, was born in Portrush, County Antrim. Acraman and Cooke dissolved their partnership in December 1854, and in 1855 Acraman joined George Main (11 December 1823 ‚Äì 6 January 1905) and John Lindsay, as Acraman, Main, and Lindsay. The company had diverse interests, from coastal and River Murray shipping (their steamers were the Culgoa, Kennedy, Sturt and Leichardt) and insurance to pastoral management, having runs in the Gawler Ranges and the west of the colony. In 1869 Lindsay partially removed from most of the company's activities with the formation of a second company Acraman, Main, & Co., but Acraman, Main, Lindsay, & Co. continued to trade until around 1870. From 1875 they acted as agents for T. B. Hall & Sons, of England, distributors of Guinness Stout. In April 1882 Acraman & Main became Acraman, Son & Co. when he took his son John Knox Acraman into partnership. Other business interests Owned ship Thomas Brown? Acraman represented the Royal Insurance Company in South Australia from around 1851 to 1891. For over 30 years he was Chairman of the South Australian Gas Company He was a director of the Adelaide and Suburban Tramway Company, the Glenelg Railway Company, and other businesses. He was a member of the Marine Board In the 1860s he and George Main took up Yardea and Moonaree stations in the Gawler Ranges, and Gum Flat on the west coast. Later they acquired the Wilpena leases on the glowing commendation of McDouall Stuart. Around 1876 Moonaree was sold to W. A. Horn, and then Messrs. Sells, Grant, and Stokes joined the original owners, and formed the combination, afterward known as Main, Sells, & Co., Ltd., one of the largest pastoral firms in South Australia. Acraman was a director of the company until the leases expired, and Main, Sells, & Co. retired from pastoral occupation. Other interests John Acraman was a great sportsman‚Äîwhile a student at Clifton he played senior cricket for Mortimer House School, which was kept by Dr. John E. Bromby, later Canon Bromby, headmaster of Melbourne Grammar School. He had a significant role in the introduction of Australian football into South Australia: he, William Fullarton and Robert Cussen, met with Henry Harrison and Tom Wills, imported the first five (round) balls, and when the original Adelaide Football Club was founded, erected the goalposts and captained one of its two sides (J. B. Spence led the other). He served as the club's president, then as the number of clubs grew, transferred to the North Adelaide side and served as a Vice-President. He was a Vice-President of the South Australian Cricketing Association, the South Australian Rowing Association, and the South Australian Lacrosse Association. He was a regular attendant at cricket and football matches on the Adelaide Oval, and followed the play closely. He was on the Board of Governors of the St. Peter's College from 1873 to 1894. He inherited his father's taste for art, and was entrusted with the purchase in Europe of valuable works. He was one of the oldest members of the Adelaide Club. Recognition Acraman crater, Lake Acraman and Acraman Creek were named for him. He has been dubbed the \\"Father of South Australian Football\\" for his role in introducing the (Victorian) game to the colony, and was in 2002 inducted into the SA Football Hall of Fame. Family John Acraman (c. 1829 ‚Äì 22 June 1907) married Sydney Sarah Knox (c. 1835 ‚Äì 23 October 1902) on 17 October 1854.

He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand under the ring name Elias. As Elias, and previously Elias Samson, he portrays a musician who often uses music as a face, to mock his opponents or as a heel, the fans in attendance, although they do chant along when Elias states that \\"WWE stands for Walk With Elias\\". Sciullo began his WWE career on the NXT brand, appearing there from 2014 to 2017 where he developed his \\"Drifter\\" ring character. Prior to joining WWE, he worked for various companies on the independent circuit under the names Heavy Metal Jesus and Logan Shulo. In 2018 the album WWE: Walk With Elias was released by the WWE Music Group featuring Sciullo.  Professional wrestling career = Independent circuit (2008‚Äì2014) = Sciullo wrestled extensively on the independent circuit for various promotions in the Northeastern USA, primarily for the International Wrestling Cartel (IWC) under the ring name Heavy Metal Jesus, Logan Shulo. While in the IWC, Shulo won the promotion's Super Indy Championship and World Heavyweight Championship. = WWE = NXT (2014‚Äì2017)  In early 2014, Sciullo was signed to a developmental deal by WWE under the ring name Elias Samson. He made his NXT debut at the April 24, 2014, tapings, working as an enhancement talent and teaming with Buddy Murphy in a losing effort against The Ascension. Samson was then used sporadically on television throughout 2014 and early 2015, mostly appearing as enhancement talent to wrestlers such as Baron Corbin. In August 2015, Samson debuted a new drifter musician character in a match taped prior to NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn, approaching the ring with a guitar before defeating Bull Dempsey, and established himself as a Heel at the same time. Samson then entered the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic tournament, where he was paired with Tucker Knight, but the two were eliminated from the tournament by Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson. On the December 23 episode of NXT, taped before NXT TakeOver: London, Samson defeated Bull Dempsey with a diving elbow drop, which he would dub as a finishing move onwards. In the following weeks, Samson would rack up victories over various competitors such as Steve Cutler and Jesse Sorensen. On the March 23, 2016 episode of NXT, after he suffered a loss to Johnny Gargano, Samson would attack him only to be fended off by Apollo Crews. This led to a match between Samson and Crews that took place at NXT TakeOver: Dallas, where Samson was defeated. Throughout the rest of the year, Samson would compete in different matches against competitors such as Shinsuke Nakamura and Finn B√°lor, but he would be on the losing side. In what would be his final feud in NXT, Samson faced Kassius Ohno (whom he mocked after he had just lost an NXT Championship match against Bobby Roode) in the first ever \\"loser leaves NXT\\" match that took place on the March 29, 2017 episode of NXT, where Samson was defeated. Just a week later, on the April 5 episode of NXT (which was taped as part of NXT TakeOver: Orlando prior to the beginning of the event), Samson wrestled his final match on NXT as the masked \\"El Vagabundo\\" (Spanish for \\"The Vagabond\\"), where he lost to Oney Lorcan, who unmasked him afterwards. Main roster beginnings (2017‚Äì2019)  Elias during one of his performances on Raw in April 2018 On the April 10, 2017, episode of Raw, Samson made his main roster debut, appearing on the stage briefly during an eight‚Äìman tag team match, as well as walking through the crowd during another match later that night. Samson continued to appear in the background playing his guitar during backstage segments over the next few weeks. In his in‚Äìring debut match on the May 22 episode of Raw, Samson defeated Dean Ambrose by disqualification after The Miz intentionally attacked him. In June, Samson started his first feud as part of the main roster with Finn B√°lor, who interrupted him during one of his performances. This led to a match between the two, where Samson defeated B√°lor in a No Disqualification match after interference from Bray Wyatt. In the end of July, WWE shortened his ring name to Elias. Elias was then placed in a feud with Jason Jordan, after Jordan would interrupt Elias during his songs by throwing vegetables at him at No Mercy. This would lead to a match between the two at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs, where Elias was defeated by Jordan. On the November 6 episode of Raw, Elias was defeated by Jordan in a Guitar‚Äìon‚Äìa‚ÄìPole match, ending their feud. Two weeks later, Elias competed in his first title match as he unsuccessfully challenged Roman Reigns for the Intercontinental Championship. On January 28, 2018, at the Royal Rumble, Elias entered his first Royal Rumble match at No. 6, lasting 26 minutes before being eliminated by John Cena. A month later, Elias competed for the first time in an Elimination Chamber match at the namesake pay‚Äìper‚Äìview, where he entered last, but was the second participant eliminated by Braun Strowman. Elias also appeared at WrestleMania 34, where he was attacked by Cena. Three weeks later, Elias competed at the Greatest Royal Rumble event, where he entered at No. 20, lasting over 30 minutes and eliminating five wrestlers before being eliminated by Bobby Lashley. Shortly after, Elias started a feud with Seth Rollins, whom he attacked with his guitar after interrupting his performance. The two eventually faced off for the Intercontinental Championship at the Money in the Bank, where Elias lost. In October, Elias turned face for the first time in his career, as he attacked Baron Corbin with his guitar. Throughout November, Elias started a feud with Bobby Lashley, who would defeat him in different matches via count‚Äìout, disqualification or a distraction by his manager Lio Rush. This led to a match at the TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs event, where Elias defeated Lashley in a ladder match with a guitar hanging over the ring, after which Lashley would attack him with the guitar after the match. The following night on Raw, Elias would gain revenge as he would attack Lashley with a guitar. This sparked a Miracle on 34th Street Fight between the two, in which Elias was victorious. At the Royal Rumble on January 27, 2019, Elias entered the Royal Rumble match at entrant 1 and was prepared for a concert before being interrupted by Jeff Jarrett, who proposed a duet. After seemingly accepting, Elias attacked Jarrett with his guitar. Afterwards, as the match officially began, Elias lasted fifteen minutes before being eliminated by the eventual winner Seth Rollins. The following night on Raw, Elias turned heel after insulting the crowd, proclaiming that they disappointed him for lackluster reactions towards him, and was subsequently interrupted by Jeff Jarrett and Road Dogg, who proceeded to sing \\"With My Baby Tonight\\" until Elias attacked both men, smashing a guitar over both Jarrett and Road Dogg. On February 4, Jeff Jarrett wrestled his first match on Raw in 19 years, losing to Elias. After the match, Jarrett smashed Elias with his guitar as payback for the previous week. Elias was attacked on both WrestleMania 35 and the Raw after the event by John Cena and The Undertaker respectively during his musical performances.  Alliance with Shane McMahon (2019‚Äì2020)  During the 2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up, Elias was drafted to the SmackDown brand. Just before Elias was to have a musical performance, he was interrupted and attacked by Roman Reigns who was also making his SmackDown debut. The following week, Shane McMahon challenged Reigns to a fight for attacking his father. Reigns came out and was attacked from behind by Elias, who assisted McMahon in beating up Reigns. Elias then challenged Reigns to a match at Money in the Bank, and Reigns accepted. At the event, Elias was defeated by Reigns in 10 seconds. On the May 28 episode of SmackDown Live, Elias pinned R-Truth with the help of McMahon and Drew McIntyre, winning the 24/7 Championship, his first title in WWE. He lost the title in the same night against R-Truth, after a tag team match that also involved Roman Reigns and Drew McIntyre. R-Truth pinned him after the match with the help of Roman Reigns. The following week at SmackDown Live he defeated again R-Truth in a Lumberjack match for the 24/7 Championship, but in the same episode, while the lumberjacks brawled with each other, Truth pinned him under the ring ending his second reign. Elias participated at the 51-Man Battle Royal at the 2019 Super Showdown but he was the last competitor eliminated by the eventual winner Mansoor. After this, Elias continued his alliance with Shane McMahon and Drew McIntyre, helping them in various feuds and matches. During the special episode WWE Smackville, he was defeated by Shane's new rival Kevin Owens. On the August 12, 2019 during the Raw episode post-SummerSlam, Elias pinned R-Truth in the backstage after hitting him with his guitar, regaining the 24/7 Title. One week later, at SmackDown, Elias participated at the King of the Ring tournament, defeating Kevin Owens during the first match thanks to the help of Shane, who made himself the special referee while the match was in progress and distracted the latter. Elias then lost and regained the 24/7 title on August 23 during the Fox Sports Founder's Day events in Los Angeles, ultimately pinning Fox Sports host Rob Stone on the set of the Fox College Football pregame show immediately after Stone had pinned R-Truth (who had pinned Elias earlier in the day while Elias was doing a concert to kick off the Founder's Day festivities). On August 27 at SmackDown Live, Drake Maverick defeated Elias for the title after the latter was attacked by Kevin Owens. It was announced on September 10, 2019 that Elias was suffering from an ankle injury and was not able to compete in the 2019 King of the Ring semifinal match against Chad Gable. After a two month hiatus, He returned on November 29, 2019 edition of SmackDown making fun of Drake Maverick, turning face in the process. The next week, he cemented his face turn when he sang with Dana Brooke and attacked Maverick.  Various feuds (2020‚Äìpresent)  Elias participated in the Royal Rumble match at the namesake pay-per-view and entered at No. 2 but was eliminated by the WWE Champion Brock Lesnar. The following Friday on SmackDown, Elias interrupted Sami Zayn and Cesaro, and thwarted an attack by Cesaro. Elias would then begin a feud with King Corbin defeating him at Wrestlemania 36 at Night 1 of the event with a roll-up pin. On the May 15 episode of SmackDown, Elias defeated Corbin again during the first round of the tournament for the vacant Intercontinental Championship. On the May 29 episode of SmackDown, he was unable to continue the tournament when he suffered an injury caused, in storyline, by a car incident. In reality, Elias had suffered a torn pectoral muscle and required surgery rendering him out of action for 6‚Äì9 months. As part of the 2020 Draft in October, Elias was drafted to the Raw brand. On the October 12 episode of Raw, he returned from injury and attacked Jeff Hardy by bashing his guitar, thus turning back to a heel through the process. He attacked Hardy because he believed Hardy was the one that took him out of action for five months.

It is a single story Greek Revival structure, built in 1849, and was the town's first purpose-built town hall. It continues to serve as a municipal meeting and polling place, although town offices are now in a modern building on Lake Street. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. Description and history Bristol Town Hall is located on the fringe of the town's central downtown area, on the north side of Summer Street just east of School Street. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade is three bays wide, the bays articulated by wide paneled pilasters. The center bay houses the building entrance in the center of a wide recess, and the flanking bays house paired slender sash windows. The pilasters rise to an entablature beneath the fully pedimented gable. The town of Bristol was incorporated in 1819 out of portions of neighboring towns. Its early town meetings were held in schools and the local Methodist church. Discussions began 1841 for the construction of a dedicated town meeting hall, which came to fruition with the construction of this hall in 1849. The building was enlarged in 1872, by adding to the rear, in order to add a stage. In addition to being used for town meetings, the hall hosted theatrical productions, social events, and the meetings of local fraternal societies. The building is distinctive in the state as a late example of Greek Revival architecture, and is a relatively modestly scaled town hall for the period when it was built.

Andr√©s Neumann  Biography = Beginnings = Andres Neumann was born in Cochabamba, Bolivia in 1943, to central European parents. His family moved to Montevideo, Uruguay, when he was five years old. His mother tongue was German, and he learned Spanish, the official language of Uruguay, only at elementary school. He developed a specific interest for the arts and culture very early, and especially for film and theater. At age 21 he married Betina Camacho, age 15. Together with his wife he joined the theater company from the Alliance Fran√ßaise in Montevideo, directed by Bernard Schnerb, a professor from the institute. Neumann quickly became active in the cultural life of Montevideo,Guilherme De Alencar Pinto, Razones locas. El paso de Eduardo Mateo por la m√∫sica uruguaya, Montevideo, Ediciones del TUMP, 1995 page 48. working professionally for theater, dance and music events held in the main venues of the city, including Teatro Solis,Fernando Pel√°ez, De las Cuevas al Sol√≠s. Cronolog√≠a del Rock en el Uruguay 1960-1975, Montevideo, Perro Andaluz Ediciones, 2002, page 127 Teatro El Galpon, and Teatro Circular. He cooperated with artists such as Omar Grasso, Carlos Manuel Varela, Luis Cerminara, Roberto Restuccia, Teresa Trujillo, Carlos Carvalho, Hugo Mazza, Jorge Carrozino and Carmen Prieto, Eduardo Mateo, Diane Denoir, and Bernardo Bergeret. During the same years Neumann made frequent trips to Europe and the US, where he became acquainted with the avant garde movements of the time. In 1970 he received the award for \\"Best Soundtrack of the Year\\" conferred by the Theater Critics Association of Uruguay, and in 1972 he received, jointly with Jorge Carrozino and Carmen Prieto, a commission from the Museo Nacional de Artes Visuales (MNAV) to fit out an important anthological exhibition of paintings and artwork by Rafael Barradas. = Relationship with France = The Alliance Fran√ßaise in Montevideo was central to the cultural life of Montevideo in a critical moment for the country and the continent. A new and modern building had been specially commissioned and constructed in Calle Soriano 1180, including a theater venue with a seating capacity of 200. For this institution, Neumann, Jorge Carrozino and Carmen Prieto (CPN) created several theatrical audiovisual environments (inspired by the French Son et Lumi√®re): Figari, Picasso 90 and 73 Dias. Thanks to these performances the trio received in October 1972 a grant from CUIFERD, sponsored by Jack Lang (future Minister of Culture of France), to work for the Festival Mondial du Th√©atre de Nancy.Jack Lang, Jean- Denis Bredin, √âclats, France, Jean-Claude Simo√´n, 1978, page 106 This invitation came at the right time, because the arts and artists began to be persecuted by a deteriorating political system. Military dictatorships were in the making in Chile, Argentina, Brasil and Uruguay. The departure of Neumann won right-wing newspaper headlines suspecting him of leaving the country in order to be trained by the French government in urban guerrilla. In the meantime, Neumann had married his second wife, Lily Salvo, an important painter and artist belonging to the Taller Torres Garcia. She was part of the active cultural life in Latin America, including Pablo Neruda and Ernesto Sabato. From their marriage a daughter named Mara was born. Andres, Lily and Mara left Uruguay in October 1972 and settled in Nancy, France, for the next two years. The Festival Mondial du Th√©atre de Nancy was at the time the world center for experimental theater, and in general for the research of new languages in the arts and culture. There Neumann met Tadeusz Kantor, Bob Wilson, Meredith Monk, Augusto Boal, Peter Schumann, Pina Bausch and Dario Fo. Neumann was an active member of the staff of the festival until 1978, appointed to curate the artistic delegations of various Scandinavian and Eastern countries as well as Italy, where he settled with his family in 1974. = Relationship with Italy = In 1974 Neumann, encouraged among others by Luigi Nono, Italian avant-garde composer and member of the central committee of the Communist Party, settled in Florence while continuing his cooperation as artistic curator of the Italian delegation to the Festival Mondial du Th√©atre de Nancy. The role of curator had put him in connection with the Italian theater world and in particular with the Teatro Regionale Toscano (now Fondazione Toscana Spettacoli). He was soon engaged by this organisation to curate a special section dedicated to experimental theater at Teatro Rondo di Bacco,Ruggiero Bianchi, \\"Nuove prospettive del teatro in Italia\\", in Arte e societ√†, January‚ÄìApril 1976, pages 41-51 a venue in the left wing of Palazzo Pitti. Neumann curated three seasons at Teatro Rondo di Bacco in Florence, inviting among many others the Bread and Puppet Theater, Bob Wilson, Meredith Monk from the US, Tadeusz Kantor with the Cricot 2 from Poland\\"Un polacco tutto d'oro\\", in Panorama, 14 July 1980Valerio Valoriani, Kantor a Firenze, Corazzano (Pisa), Titivillus Edizioni, 2002, pages 51-52J√≤zef Chrobak, Carlo Sisi, Tadeusz Kantor. Dipinti, disegni, teatro, Rome, Edizioni di storia e letteratura, 2002, page VI and Roberto Benigni from Italy. As talent scout, Neumann promoted internationally the work of Italian theater artist and companies such as Magazzini Criminali and Pierluigi Pieralli from Florence, and Remondi & Caporossi and Mem√© Perlini from Rome. After his engagement in Florence he was commissioned by Carlo Molfese to create for Teatro Tenda (Piazza Mancini, Rome) a festival under the name of Rassegna Internazionale di Teatro Popolare,Gennaro Colangelo, Carlo Molfese, Un teatro a Roma. L'avventura del Teatro Tenda di Piazza Mancini, Rome, Gangemi Editore, 2006, pages 87, 89 where artists such as Marcel Marceau from France, Vittorio Gassman and Gigi Proietti from Italy, Teatro Campesino from the US, Tadashi Suzuki from Japan, Robert Serumaga from Uganda and Jango Edwards from Netherlands were presented. During this activity in Rome Major Carlo Giulio Argan and Secretary for Culture Renato Nicolini invited Neumann to develop for the city of Rome a special project dedicated to cutting-edge performing arts.Renato Nicolini, Estate Romana. 1976-85: un effimero lungo nove anni, Siena, Edizioni Sisifo, 1991, pages 55, 148 A long and close working cooperation with Renato Nicolini to enhance national and international cultural exchange programs in the arts and culture between the City of Rome and other important Italian and world cities was put in place.Joan de Sagarra, \\"El Ministerio de Cultura patrocinar√° un festival de teatro espa√±ol en distinctas ciudades italianas\\", in El Pays, 7 April 1986 Part of this program was a production of a performance directed by Richard Foreman with the Ontological-Hysterical Theater from New York City, guest performances of Ariane Mnouchkine and the Th√©atre du Soleil, of Peter Brook, Terry Riley, and the National Theater from London, the projection of the film Napoleon by Abel Gance with live orchestra directed by Carmine Coppola (father to Francis Ford) in front of the Roman Colosseum to the presence of Jack Lang and Danielle Mitterrand.Marion Scali, \\"Andres Neumann, marchand d'imaginaire\\", in Liberation, 15 July 1985  Andres Neumann International  In 1979 Neumann simultaneously curated two major international theatrical production projects for two important stage directors in two different cities. Wielopole Wielopole for Tadeusz Kantor in Florence, and Place and Target for Richard Foreman in Rome. In the same year a private presenting and production company was established: Andres Neumann International. This move was inspired by the advice of Franco Camerlinghi, at that time Secretary of Culture for the city of Florence. The first client of this company were the brothers I Colombaioni, the clowns who had worked with Federico Fellini for the film The Clowns (1970). For them, and during the following years, an international tour in more than 100 world cities was put in place.Paolo Crespi, \\"Andres Neumann, agente teatrale o mercante d'arte?\\", in Avvenire, 26 November 1986 Between 1979 and 2000 Andres Neumann International became the center of a worldwide network of cultural exchange projects for the performing arts. Ingmar Bergman from Sweden, Andrzej Wajda from Poland, Luca Ronconi, Vittorio Gassman, Dario Fo from Italy, the Com√©die Francaise and Peter Brook from France, The Kabuki from Japan, and Pina Bausch from Germany entrusted their work to Andres Neumann during those years.\\"Andres Neumann: un uruguayo en el mundo del teatro europeo\\", in El D√≠a, Montevideo, 11 February 1989 Until 1985 the company was based in Florence. After the international co-production project for Peter Brooks The Mahabharata, the company moved its headquarters to Rome, where it kept operating until 2000.Andres Neumann, \\"Doy la posibilidad de que se encuentran p√∫blico y artista\\" in √öltimas Noticias, 18 April 1996  Recent years  In 1990 Neumann bought a country house in Anghiari, Tuscany, where he then spent most of his time. He undertook a process of transformation in the attempt to find the roots of art and culture through physical and spiritual practices.Paolo Boccacci, \\"Il mio palcoscenico? La coscienza\\", in La Repubblica, 1 February 1989 Thanks to Peter Brook he approached the Gurdjieff groups, and thanks to Graciela Figueroa he approached the Claudio Naranjo SAT groups. His interest in theater and dance shifted from the finished production to the practical creative and pedagogical process, thus meeting individuals such as Enrique Vargas, Kristin Linklater and Juan Carlos Corazza. In 2001 he had a son, Ren√©, with Viviana Benci, a school teacher he had met at the Gurdjieff groups. Also the connection to his origins in South America were reestablished, and he started to regularly spend time in both continents. = Incubator and archive for the arts and culture in Tuscany = In 2004, together with the Associazione Culturale Teatro Studio Blu, Neumann started to develop a project for the creation of a cultural center in Pistoia. This project came to a conclusion in 2009 with the opening of the Il Funaro Cultural Center, and the donation to the Center of the Archivio Teatrale Andres Neumann. The center is a venue with three working spaces, dressing rooms, office space, restaurant, construction laboratory, library and guesthouse for 16 people Andrea Ottanelli, Inventario dell'Archivio Teatrale Andres Neumann, Ed.

Heavy metal guitar (or simply metal guitar) is the use of highly-amplified electric guitar in heavy metal.Weinstein (2000), pp. 14, 118. Heavy metal guitar playing is rooted in the guitar playing styles developed in 1960s-era blues rock and psychedelic rock,Fast (2005), pp. 89‚Äì91; Weinstein (2000), pp. 7, 8, 23, 36, 103, 104. and it uses a massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos and overall loudness. The electric guitar and the sonic power that it projects through amplification has historically been the key element in heavy metal.Weinstein (2000), p. 23 The heavy metal guitar sound comes from a combined use of high volumes and heavy distortion.Walser, Robert (1993). Running with the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music. Wesleyan University Press. p. 10. . Heavy metal bands often have two electric guitarists, with one guitarist playing rhythm guitar and one guitarist playing lead guitar. The rhythm guitar player is part of the rhythm section of the band, along with the bass guitarist and the drummer. The lead guitarist plays guitar solos, instrumental melody lines and melodic fill passages. In power trios, which consist of a guitarist, bassist and drummer, with one or more members singing lead vocals, the single guitarist will switch between rhythm guitar and lead guitar roles as needed. Rhythm guitar The guitarists from Children of Bodom, performing at the 2007 Masters of Rock festival The rhythm guitar player is part of the rhythm section of the band, along with the bass guitarist and drummer (and in some bands, a keyboard player). The rhythm guitarist typically plays power chords and riffs using an electric guitar that is plugged into a guitar amplifier, with either the amplifier and/or a distortion effect pedal creating a thick, heavy, distorted sound. The rhythm guitar player plays chords and riffs that create, along with the bass and drums, the rhythmic sound of a metal song. The rhythm guitar also plays the chord progression of a song, along with the bass player (and, if the band has one, the keyboard player). In 1966, the British company Marshall Amplification began producing the Marshall 1963, a guitar amplifier capable of producing the distorted \\"crunch\\" that rock musicians were starting to seek. With rhythm guitar parts, the \\"heavy crunch sound in heavy metal...[is created by] palm muting\\" the strings with the picking hand and using distortion.\\"Lesson four- Power chords\\" . Marshall Amps. Palm muting creates a tighter, more precise sound and it emphasizes the low end.Damage Incorporated: Metallica and the Production of Musical Identity. By Glenn Pillsbury. Routledge, 2013 Some rhythm guitarists sing lead vocals or backup vocals simultaneously as they play guitar. Lead guitar Eddie Van Halen soloing in 1977 The lead guitarist plays guitar solos, instrumental melody lines and melodic fill passages. Guitar solos are \\"...an essential element of the heavy metal code ... that underscores the significance of the guitar\\" to the genre.Weinstein, p. 24 Most heavy metal songs \\"... featur[e] at least one guitar solo\\",Walser, p. 50 which is \\"... a primary means through which the heavy metal performer expresses virtuosity\\". One exception is nu metal bands, which tend to omit guitar solos. Shred guitar or \\"shredding\\" is a virtuoso lead guitar solo playing style for the electric guitar that is used in a number of metal genres. Shredding uses a range of fast playing techniques, such as \\"sweep-picked arpeggios, diminished and harmonic minor scales, finger- tapping, fast scale and arpeggio runs and special effects such as tremolo bar \\"dive bombs\\". Metal guitarists playing in a \\"shred\\" style use the electric guitar with a guitar amplifier and a range of electronic effects such as distortion, which create a more sustained guitar tone and facilitate guitar feedback effects. In 1978, a \\"heretofore unknown guitarist named Eddie Van Halen\\" from Los Angeles released \\"'Eruption', a blistering aural assault of solo electric guitar\\" which featured rapid \\"tapping\\", which \\"had rarely been heard in a rock context before\\". Chris Yancik argues that it is this \\"record, above any other, that spawned the genre of Shred\\". Some lead guitarists sing lead vocals or backup vocals when they are not playing guitar solos. =Equipment= Shred guitar players often use electric solid-body guitars such as Ibanez, Gibson, Fender, Kramer, Kiesel/Carvin, Jackson, Charvel, Schecter and ESP. Some shred guitarists use elaborately-shaped models by B.C. Rich or Dean, as well as modern versions of classic-radical designs like Gibson's Flying V and Explorer models. Tremolo bars (also known as \\"whammy bars\\"), which are hinged bridges that can be bent down or up in pitch, are an important part of shred playing, as they permit the \\"dive bombing\\" effect and many sounds which are not possible with a fixed-bridge instrument. Guitars with double-cutaways give performers easier access to the higher frets. Many guitar makers are now making a \\"scalloped cutaway\\" which was popularized by Irron R. Collins IV. This removes material on the backside of the \\"horn\\" allowing extended room for the fretting hand to get extended reach onto the higher notes of the fretboard. Some shred guitarists, such as Scorpions' Ulrich Roth, have used custom-made tremolo bars and developed modified instruments, such as Roth's \\"Sky Guitar, that would greatly expand his instrumental range, enabling him to reach notes previously reserved in the string world for cellos and violins.\\" Some shred guitar players use seven or eight string guitars to allow a greater range of notes, such as Steve Vai. Most shred guitar players use a range of effects such as distortion and audio compression units, both of which increase sustain and facilitate the performance of shred techniques such as tapping, hammer-ons, and pull-offs. These and other effects units, such as delay effects are also used to create a unique tone. Shred-style guitarists often use high-gain vacuum tube amplifiers such as Marshall, Carvin, Peavey, Mesa Boogie, ENGL, Laney, Hughes & Kettner and Randall. To facilitate the use of audio feedback effects with the guitar, shred guitarists use high gain settings, distortion pedals and high on-stage volume. Loudness A 3√ó6 stack of Marshall guitar cabinets for Jeff Hanneman of Slayer Electric guitarists in metal use large, powerful guitar amplifiers, typically with multiple large speaker cabinets. Some metal guitarists use 18 or more speaker cabinets, with each cabinet containing four 10\\" speakers. Following the lead set by Jimi Hendrix, Cream and The Who, early heavy metal acts such as Blue Cheer set new benchmarks for volume. As Blue Cheer's Dick Peterson put it, \\"All we knew was we wanted more power.\\"Walser (1993), p. 9 A 1977 review of a Mot√∂rhead concert noted how \\"excessive volume in particular figured into the band's impact\\".Paul Sutcliffe quoted in Waksman, Steve. \\"Metal, Punk, and Mot√∂rhead: Generic Crossover in the Heart of the Punk Explosion\\" .

Morgan Lander, the guitarist of Kittie. In relation to the gender composition of heavy metal bands, it has been said that \\"[h]eavy metal performers are almost exclusively male\\" \\"...[a]t least until the mid-1980s\\" apart from \\"... exceptions such as Girlschool\\". However, \\"...now [in the 2010s] maybe more than ever‚Äìstrong metal women have put up their dukes and got down to it\\",\\"carv[ing] out a considerable place for [them]selves\\". Given that most heavy metal musicians are male, most metal guitarists are male. Almost all of the most well-known metal guitarists in major bands are male. Women have less roles in rock music genres like metal because the \\"... rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion\\". Philip Auslander says that \\"Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music\\". Though some women played instruments in American all-female garage rock bands, none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So they \\"did not provide viable templates for women's on-going participation in rock\\". Notable women metal guitarists include: *Lita Ford (born 1958) is an American rock guitarist, vocalist and songwriter, who was the lead guitarist for The Runaways in the late 1970s before embarking on a solo career in the 1980s. In 1975, at age 16, Ford was recruited by recording impresario Kim Fowley to join the all-female rock band he was assembling called The Runaways. Ford's guitar playing was a key part of the band's sound. After The Runaways disbanded, Ford signed with RCA Records in the 1980s and developed a pop-metal sound. In 1988, she released her most commercially successful album, the self-produced Lita. The album featured several singles including \\"Kiss Me Deadly\\", \\"Back to the Cave\\", \\"Close My Eyes Forever\\", and \\"Falling In and Out of Love\\", a song co-written by Nikki Sixx of M√∂tley Cr√ºe. *The Great Kat is the stage name of Katherine Thomas (born 1966), an English- born musician best known for her thrash metal interpretations of well-known pieces of classical music. Most feature her using the electric guitar, but some have her on violin. Thomas is a classically trained violinist, graduating from the Juilliard School and touring for a time playing conventional classical music before crossing over to metal.Ganz, Caryn. July 2003, SPIN Magazine, \\"Faster, Pussy Kat, Kill!, Kill!\\".Guitar One magazine listed her as one of the \\"Fastest Shredders of All Time\\". *Morgan Lander (born 1982) is the lead singer and guitarist for the Canadian metal group Kittie. She is known for her use of metal growls as a vocalist, though she also sings with a clean voice as well. She uses Hamer Vectors, a custom GW Flying V, Gibson Flying V's, Peavey 6505s, Marshall 4x12 cabinets, Krank Amplification Krankenstein+'s, and Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifiers.

Founded in 1998 by Jenifer Estess, Valerie Estess, Meredith Estess, and Julianne Hoffenberg, Project ALS recruits scientists and doctors to work together ‚Äî rationally and aggressively ‚Äî toward a better understanding of ALS and other closely related neuro-degenerative diseases.  History  Project ALS was founded in 1998 as a non-profit organization when Jenifer Estess, a 35-year-old New York theater and film producer, was diagnosed with ALS. Historically, scientists working separately on various aspects of the disease conducted ALS research. Project ALS changed that approach by requiring that researchers and doctors work together, share data openly, and meet research milestones. Project ALS's Research Advisory Board (RAB) brings together accomplished scientists to seek out the most promising research and set the agenda for the entire research field.  Research = ALS in a dish = In 2008, scientists from the Jenifer Estess Stem Cell Lab, Harvard, and Columbia achieved the Time \\"Scientific Breakthrough of the Year\\" by reprogramming motor neurons from a small sample of skin from an ALS patient ‚Äî a method known as iPS, or induced pluripotent stem cell technology. = Improving cell metabolism = A cell's inability to metabolize proteins is a hallmark of ALS, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. The Project ALS team led by researchers at Harvard and the University of Massachusetts are studying pathways responsible for poor protein management in ALS. = Ocular Motor Neuron Resistance study = ALS affects nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except for the muscles controlling eye movement. Project ALS is driving a six-laboratory study of ocular motor neuron resistance. The goal is to confer resistance upon more vulnerable motor neurons in ALS. = Lipids = Project ALS researchers at Columbia University have identified distinctive lipid signatures that may lead to early diagnosis and information about disease progression.

There temples are sacred to the Digambara and the Svetambara branches of Jainism. In Jainism left According to Jain religious beliefs, Neminath, the 22nd Tirthankara Neminath became an ascetic after he saw the slaughter of animals for a feast on his wedding. He renounced all worldly pleasures and came to Mount Girnar to attain salvation. He attained omniscience and Moksha (died) on the Mount Girnar. His bride-to-be Rajulmati also renounced and became a nun. Jain Temples Girnar was anciently called Raivata or Ujjayanta, sacred amongst the Jains to Neminath, the 22nd Tirthankar, and a place of pilgrimage before 250 BCE. Situated on the first plateau of Mount Girnar at the height of about 3800 steps, at an altitude of 2370 ft above Junagadh, still some 600 ft below the first summit of Girnar, there are Jain temples with marvelous carvings in marble. Some 16 Jain temples here form a sort of fort on the ledge at the top of the great cliff. These temples are along the west face of the hill, and are all enclosed. = Neminath Temple = left Plan of Neminath Jain Temple The Neminath temple is the largest temple of the group standing in a quadrangular court 195 x 130 feet. The temple was rebuilt completely by Sajjana, the governor of Saurashtra appointed by Jayasimha Siddharaja, in 1129 CE. There is an inscription on one of the pillars of the mandapa stating that it was repaired in 1278 CE. It consists of two rangamandapa halls with two porches and a central shrine (Gudhamandapa), which contains a large black image of Neminath sitting in the lotus position holding a conch in his palm. The principal hall in front of the central shrine measures across from door to door inside 41' 7\\" x 44' 7\\" from the shrine door to that leading out at the west end. The roof is supported by 22 square columns of granite coated with white lime while the floor is of tessellated marble. Round the central shrine is a circumambulatory passage (pradakshina) with many images in white marble including that of a Ganesha and a Chovishi or slab of the twenty four Tirthankara. Between the outer and inner halls are two shrines. The outer hall measures 38' x 21' 3\\". The outer hall has two small raised platforms paved with slabs of yellow stone, covered with representations of feet in pairs called padukas, which represent the 2452 feet of the Gandharas, first disciples of Tirthankaras. On the west of this is a closed entrance with a porch overhanging the perpendicular scarp of the hill. On two of the pillars of the mandapa are inscriptions dated 1275, 1281, and 1278 ‚Äî dates of restoration. The enclosure in which these rangamandapas and the central shrine are situated, is nearly surrounded inside by 70 little cells, each enshrining a marble image on a bench, with a covered passage running round in front of them lighted by a perforated stone screen. The principal entrance was originally on the east side of the court; but it is now closed, and the entrance from the south side of court in Khengar's Palace is that now used. On south side, there is a passage leading into a low dark temple, with granite pillars in lines. Opposite the entrance is a recess containing two large black images; in the back of the recess is a lion rampant, and over it a crocodile in bas-relief. Behind these figures is a room from which is a descent into a cave, with a large white marble image which is mostly concealed. It has a slight hollow in the shoulder, said to be caused by water dropping from the ear, whence it was called Amijhara, \\"nectar drop\\". There are few shrines in the court dedicated to Jain monks. In the North porch are inscriptions which state that in Samwat 1215 certain Thakurs completed the shrine, and built the Temple of Ambika. There is a small temple of Adinath behind the Neminath temple facing west which was built by Jagmal Gordhan of Porwad family in VS 1848 under guidance of Jinendra Suri. = Adabadji Adinatha temple = There are three temples to the left of the passage from the north porch of the Neminath temple. Of them, the temple on the south contains a colossal image of Adinatha, the first Tirthankar, exactly like that at Palitana temples. The image is in standing meditating (kausaggiya) position On the throne of this image is a slab of yellow stone carved in 1442, with figures of the 24 Tirthankars. = Panchmeru temple = On the north, opposite the Adabadji temple, there is Panchabai's or Panchmeru temple which was built in VS 1859. It contains five sikhars or spires each enshrining quadruple images. = Meraka-vasahi = West of Panchmeru temple, there is a large temple. The temples is called Malekavasahi, Merakavasahi or Merakavashi due to false identification. Madhusudan Dhaky noted that the Merakavasahi was a small shrine somewhere near east gate of Neminatha temple while the current temple is large one and outside the north gate of the Neminatha temple. Based on its architecture, Dhaky dates the temple to 15th century and notes that it is mentioned as Kharataravasahi built or restored by Bhansali Narpal Sanghavi in the old itineraries of Jain monks. The temple is depicted in the Shatrunjaya- Giranar Patta dated 1451 CE (VS 1507) in Ranakpur temple so it must have built before it. The temple may have been built as early as 1438 CE. Dhaky believes that the temple may have been built on the site of the Satyapuravatara Mahavira's temple built by Vastupala. According to an anecdote said by modern Jain writers, Sajjana, the minister of Chaulukya king Siddharaja Jayasimha, built the Neminatha temple using the state treasury. When he collected the funds to return as a compensation, the king declined to accept it so the funds were used to built the temple. Dhaky concludes that the anecdote is not mentioned in any early work and is false. Sahastraphana (thousand hooded) Parshwanatha, the image which was consecrated in 1803 CE (VS 1459) by Vijayajinendra Suri, is currently the central deity in the temple. The temple originally housed the golden image of Mahavira and brass images of Shantinatha and Parshwanatha on its sides. The east facing temple has 52 small shrines surrounding the central temple. It has an open portico with ceilings with fine carvings. In the bhamti or cloisters surrounding the court, there are also some remarkable designs in carved ceilings. The roof of the rangamandapa has fine carvings. The shrine proper must have been removed and replaced with new one at the end of the sixteenth century or the start of the seventeenth century. It is known that Karmachandra Bachchhavat, minister of the king of Bikaner, had sent a funds to renovate temple in Shatrunjaya and Girnar under Jinachandrasuri IV of Kharatara Gaccha during the reign of Akbar. There is a shrine housing replica of Ashtapada hill in the south, shrine with Shatrunjayavatar in west, behind the main temple, and Samet Shikhar (or Nandishwar Dwipa) in north. = Sangram Soni's Temple = North of the Melakavasahi, there is a temple of Parshwanath in the enclosure. The original temple on the site was Kalyanatraya temple dedicated to Neminatha built by Tejapala, brother of Vastupala. This Kalyanatraya contained quadruple images in three tires as the central deity. The new temple on the site was built in 1438 CE (VS 1494) by Oswal Soni Samarasimha and Vyavahari Maladev. The spire of this 15th century temple is replaced by new spire built c. 1803 CE. The temple is now mistakenly known as Sangram Soni's temple. It was repaired by Premabhai Hemabhai about 1843. It contains a large white marble figure of Parswanatha bearing the date 1803 CE with the polycephalous cobra over him whence he is styled Seshphani. This temple is peculiar in having a sort of gallery and like the previous one of the central deity faces the east whilst the others mostly face the west. = Kumarapala's Temple = Kumarapala temple The last temple to the north is known as the Kumarapala's temple which is falsely attributed to 12th century Chaulukya king Kumarapala. Based on the literary, epigraphic and architectural evidence, Madhusudan Dhaky concluded that the temple belongs to 15th century and was built by Purnasinha Koshthagarika (Punsi Kothari). The central deity was Shantinatha and was consecrated by Jinakirti Suri probably in 1438 CE. The part of the original temple was destroyed by the 18th century and appears to have been restored in 1824 CE by Hansraja Jetha which is known from the inscription. The temple is west facing. The original temple had 72 shrines surrounding the central temple which no longer exist. The central temple has a modern long open portico supported by twenty four columns. The temple proper or mandapa and shrine are small and the ceilings and architraves are restored. The mandapa with its beautiful pendentive and the pillars and lintels of the portico. The shrine contains three images; in the middle Abhinandana Swami dedicated in 1838 and on either side Adinatha and Sambhavanatha dated 1791. = Mansingha Bhojaraja temple = To the east of the Devakota, there are several temples: the principal being the temple of Mansingha Bhojaraja of Kachchh, an old granite temple near the entrance gate which is now dedicated to Sambhavanatha. = Vastupala-vihara = left Plan of Vastupala-vihara Vastupala-vihara is a triple temple, the central fane measuring 53 feet by 29 has two domes and finely carved but much mutilated and the shrine which is 13 feet square with a large niche or gokhla on the left side contains an image of Mallinatha. Beneath the image is the inscription mentioning Vastupala and his family members. On either side this central temple, there is a large hall about 38 feet 6 inches from door to door containing a remarkable solid pile of masonry called a samovasarana that on the north side named Sumeru having a square base and the other Sameta Sikhara with a nearly circular one. Each rises in four tiers of diminishing width almost to the roof and is surmounted by a small square canopy over images. The upper tiers are reached by steps arranged for the purpose. On the outside of the shrine tower are three small niches in which images have been placed and there are stone ladders up to the niches to enable the pujaris to reach them. The temple was completed in 1232 CE. There are six large inscriptions of Vastupala in the temple dated VS 1288. Originally Shatrunjayavatara Adinatha was the central deity of the temple. The roofs of temple were rebuilt in the 15th century. There is another temple on the cliff behind the Vastupala-vihara which is now known as Gumasta temple. The temple was built by Vastupala and was dedicated to Marudevi. Another shrine behind Vastupala-vihara is dedicated to Kapardi Yaksha. = Samprati Raja temple = Samprati Raja temple Farther north of the Vastupala-vihara, the Samprati Raja temple is situated. The temple was built in 1453 (VS 1509) CE by Shanraj and Bhumbhav from Khambhat. It was originally dedicated to Vimalanatha. According to Dhaky, the temple was built on the site of Stambhanatirthavatara Parshwanatha temple built by Vastupala. The temple is mistakenly attributed to Maurya ruler Samprati. It is built against the side of a cliff and is ascended to by a stair. Inside the entrance there is another very steep flight of steps in the porch leading up to a large mandapa to the east of which is added a second mandapa and a gambhara or shrine containing a black image of Neminatha dedicated by Karnarama Jayaraja in 1461. = Other temples = Dharamchand Hemchand temple To the east of Vastupala vihara and Samprati Raja temples, and on the face of the hill above, there are other temples among them an old one going by the name of Dharmasa of Mangrol or Dharamchand Hemchand built of grey granite the image being also of granite. Near it is another ruined shrine in which delicate granite columns rise from the corners of the sinhasana or throne carved with many squatting figures. Near this is the only shrine on this mount to Mahavira. South of this, and 200 feet above the Jain temples on way to the first summit, is the Gaumukhi Shrine, near a plentiful spring of water. Away on the north, climbing down the steps, there are two shrines dedicated to Neminatha in Sahsavan where he said to have taken renunciation and attained omniscience. Neminatha is said to have attained Nirvana or died on the highest peak of the Girnar. There is a modern Samovasarana temple.  Tanks  Outside to the north of the Kumarapala's temple, there is the Bhima Kunda, a tank measuring 70 feet by 50 feet.

Its purpose was disruption of the supply of rice to Communist forces occupying the Ho Chi Minh Trail. It was successful. Overview From the start of the Vietnam War, the Ho Chi Minh Trail became crucial to the People's Army of Vietnam strategy as its key to conquering South Vietnam. Over the war years, the Trail expanded to of road, trail, and waterway. Tchepone in the panhandle of the Kingdom of Laos became a key transshipment and logistics center for the communists. Its significance can be measured by the fact that after many attempts to cut the Trail from Laos, the multi-divisional Operation Lam Son 719 was launched on 8 February 1971 from South Vietnam to capture Tchepone.Nalty, pp. 5-7; 149-154.Castle, pp. 108-109. From 28 July through 31 October 1971, Royalist forces of the Kingdom of Laos had staged Operation Sayasila in Military Region 4 (MR 4). They managed to wrest control of Route 23 and the towns of Salavan and Paksong and their associated airstrips from the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN).Conboy, Morrison, pp. 304-307. Background When the Khmer Republic withdrew its Project Copper forces from MR 4, it vacated a training base at the PS-18 airstrip. The local Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) unit trained its Bataillons Guerrieres (BGs) there for forays against the Trail. By Autumn 1971, they had formed the first guerrilla regiment, Groupement Mobile 41 (GM 41) from BGs 402, 403, 407, and 408. The CIA case officer who had trained the local Commando Raiders was transferred to advisory duty with GM 41. With a highly respected Royalist Lieutenant Colonel in command, GM 41 was operational as Operation Sayasila ended.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 307-308. Operation Bedrock Operation Bedrock's objective was the removal of the 46th Battalion of the People's Army of Vietnam from the rice paddies southwest of Salavan, thus depriving the Communist foe of food. On 1 November 1971, GM 41 was helilifted to Salavan.Hukle, et al, p. 21.Conboy, Morrison, p. 308. The guerrilla regiment stepped off and moved 17 kilometers southwest of Route 16/23. On either 2 November or the next morning, the Royalist guerrillas seized the crucial triple road junction of Routes 16, 23, and 231, 21 kilometers southwest of Salavan. One battalion with a heavy weapons company set up a defensive position atop Phou Kong Noy, overlooking the triple junction. Scattered contacts with Communist troops occurred over 3 and 4 November. The guerrillas depended on their air superiority and called in close air support strikes in these instances; they also utilized heavy weapons fire. The Royalists continued their sweep back toward their point of departure. On 5 November, the Royalists occupied Ban Naxain Noy, some 18 kilometers southwestward of Salavan. A resident stated that the headquarters of the PAVN 46th Battalion had moved out the day before. There was no contact with Communist forces over the next few days, as the Royalist regiment split into battalions for offensive sweeps. One battalion roved to a point nine kilometers north of the Communist base camp at Thateng. Another occupied the village of Ban Lavang. No more clashes occurred, as the Bataillon Guerriers regrouped at Salavan to end Operation Bedrock on 9 November 1971. Result As a rice denial mission, the movement was also considered a success alongside the secret operation delta. The PAVN 46th Battalion's control of the rice growing plains near Salalvan was broken. Aftermath Groupement Mobile 41 was now free for future operations. Operation Thao La was being planned for it.

Frequently made of metal, ormolu, often with gilded wood stands, porcelain (both European and Asian), garnitures became popular during the latter half of the 17th century and remained in vogue throughout the 19th century. A very common placement is on the mantelpiece over a fireplace, but garnitures were very often placed on various pieces of furniture, and on ledges or niches around the walls of a room, especially over doors or above fireplaces. Garnitures may contain pieces made together with a view to being used as a set, or may be \\"assembled\\" by the decorator from pieces of different origin. Most commonly a garniture is a collection of three matching pieces designed for the adornment of a mantlepiece; for example: a clock and two flanking vases or candelabra.

Because of his race, he was excluded from the whites-only artistic movement known as the Charleston Renaissance. Early life He was born in Charleston, South Carolina, on March 14, 1882. He was one of five surviving children of Louisa Moultrie Harleston and Edwin Gaillard Harleston, a prosperous former coastal schooner captain who owned the Harleston Funeral Home. His mother traced her lineage through several generations of free people of color, while his father was descended from a white planter and one of his slaves. Harleston won a scholarship to study at the Avery Normal Institute, from which he graduated as valedictorian in 1900. He went on to Atlanta University, where studied chemistry and sociology and took courses with W. E. B. Du Bois, who became a lifelong friend. After graduating in 1904, Harleston stayed on for a year as a teaching assistant in both sociology and chemistry while planning the next step in his education. Although he was admitted to Harvard University, he decided instead to attend the Boston Museum of Fine Art's school. There he studied under the painters William McGregor Paxton and Frank Weston Benson from 1905 to December 1912. Harleston returned to South Carolina in 1913 to help his father run the funeral home, continuing to do so until 1931, the year both he and his father died. He became active in local civil rights groups and in 1917 rose to be president of Charleston's newly formed branch of the NAACP. One campaign he led succeeded in getting the local public school system to hire black teachers. Art career Edwin Harleston, Portrait of a Woman, oil on canvas, 1920. Harleston painted in a realist style that was influenced by both his Boston training and his wife Elise Forrest Harleston's photographic work. He mostly painted portraits, often on commission, and his sitters included notables such as Grace Towns, who later became the first African- American woman elected to the Georgia General Assembly; philanthropist Pierre S. du Pont; and Edward Twitchell Ware, a former president of Atlanta University. He also painted genre scenes of the daily life of Charleston's African-American citizens, especially its rising middle class, as well as landscapes of South Carolina Lowcountry. Out of step with the rising modernism of the 1920s, he saw himself as continuing in the tradition of Henry Ossawa Tanner by portraying black people and their lives realistically instead of as caricatures or stereotypes. Harleston was described by W. E. B. Du Bois as the \\"leading portrait painter of the race\\" even though his responsibility for helping to run the funeral home meant he could never devote himself to being a painter full-time. In 1920, Harleston married photographer Elise Forrest, with whom he opened a studio across the street from the funeral home. This studio, which had both workspace and a public gallery to promote their artwork, was the first such public art establishment for Charleston's African-American citizens. Harleston often used Elise's photographs as the basis of his paintings and drawings; one of his best-known works, Miss Sue Bailey with the African Shawl, is based on a photograph by Elise. A three-quarter length seated portrait in dark colors and muted light, the painting exemplifies Harleston's commitment to portraying his sitters with dignity. Starting in 1930, Harleston helped artist Aaron Douglas paint his Symbolic Negro History murals for Fisk University; these are now considered among Douglas's most important works. This project was completed in 1930, the year before Harleston died. In 1930, Harleston painted Douglas's portrait with the unfinished mural in the background, typically emphasizing the sitter's profession and character while avoiding any suggestion of the picturesque. Harleston won a number of awards for his work, including the top prize in NAACP-sponsored contests in 1925 (A Colored Grand Army Man) and 1931 (Ouida) and the William E. Harmon Foundation's Alain Locke Prize for portrait painting, also in 1931 (The Old Servant). Despite this modest success, Harleston was largely excluded from the dominantly white artistic circles of the Charleston Renaissance with which his work is today associated. Only writer Julia Peterkin, who won a Pulitzer Prize for her writing about African-American life, appears to have visited Harleston. Although writer DuBose Heyward based a character on him in his novel Mamba's Daughters, it seems they never met in person. Racial prejudice and segregation thwarted several potential commissions and blocked a planned 1926 exhibition of his work at the Charleston Museum that had been organized by museum director Laura Bragg and promoted by the city's mayor, Thomas Porcher Stoney. By 1930, the funeral home business was suffering from the Great Depression. Harleston undertook a series of lectures at black colleges to earn money. In April 1931, Harleston's father died of pneumonia, and Harleston himself (who is said to have kissed his dying father goodbye) succumbed to the same ailment less than a month later at the age of 49. Legacy Harleston's paintings are in the collections of the Gibbes Museum of Art (Charleston), the Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture (Charleston), the Savannah (GA) College of Art and Design Museum of Art, and the California African American Museum. Harleston's papers are held by the South Carolina Historical Society and Emory University's Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library. ReferencesFurther reading * Ball, Edward.

After graduating from Panevƒó≈æys Gymnasium, Tarabildienƒó studied in Kaunas from 1929 to 1935 and specialized in sculpture, which she studied with Juozas Zikaras. Her graduation work was rated as excellent, and she was awarded a fellowship to continue her study abroad. In 1937, she went to Paris, together with her husband Petras Tarabildas and her oldest son Arunas. Two other children, Giedrƒô and Ramon, stayed back in Lithuania. She also traveled around Southern Europe. When World War II started, Tarabildienƒó was still in Paris, and she went back to Lithuania to reunite with the two children. Subsequently, Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union. Tarabildienƒó was a member of the Lithuanian Roerikh Society, which was run in Kaunas between 1935 and 1940 by the followers of Nicholas Roerich. Since 1935, she was mostly working in graphics, including book illustration. Starting from 1940, when she first got a major prize for her work (The State Prize of the savings banks), Tarabildienƒó was considered the most influential Lithuanian graphical artist. She developed a special technique to illustrate folkloric motives, and she exerted a lot of influence of the younger artists. In particular, during the Soviet period artists were not allowed to travel abroad, and Tarabildienƒó's style became one of the standards in Lithuania. In 1950, her first major solo exhibition was held in Kaunas. In 1972, she was awarded the State Prize of the Lithuanian SSR, and in 1974 was made the People's Artist of the Lithuanian SSR.

He later studied in electrotherapy and led the research into the causes of cholera and other epidemics as a result of exposure to natural electricity. He was the first physician to recommend the breathing in of iodine in water vapour for respiratory diseases. Born in County Londonderry, Murray became a licentiate in midwifery having studied at the Edinburgh College of Surgeons in 1807. He undertook studies in pharmaceuticals, an area in which he became competent. In 1809 he developed the foundations of a fluid magnesia, which contained a base ingredient of magnesium sulfate. He modified it for it to act as an aid for \\"weak nerves\\", low fever, spasms, cholera, and diarrhoea. He named his recipe Fluid Magnesia, and set up the company Sir James Murray & Son to successfully market it. Murray graduated from the University of Edinburgh as a Doctor of Medicine in 1829, and became the resident physician to Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey, in 1831, a post Murray held until the 1840s. Murray was knighted in 1833 and received an honorary degree in medicine from Dublin University the following year. He was appointed as an inspector of anatomical schools in Ireland, and was a member of the central board of health, as well as the resident physician to the Netterville Dispensary and the Anglesey Lying-In Hospital, Dublin. Murray died at his home in Dublin on 8 December 1871. He is the great-grandfather of the English actor Michael Hordern. Biography=Early life and education= Murray was born in County Londonderry to Edward Murray and his wife, Belinda n√©e Powell. James attended the Edinburgh College of Surgeons where he became a licentiate in midwifery in 1807. There, and after hearing lectures by the English chemist, physicist, and meteorologist, John Dalton, Murray undertook studies to establish the \\"exact proportions of heat, or electricity, naturally belonging to ... living atoms, in a state of health\\".Murray, p. 6. After receiving his qualification, Murray was appointed the resident medical officer at a hospital in Belfast. His career flourished under the hospital's patron, George Chichester, 3rd Marquess of Donegall, who owned Belfast Castle.Hines- Davenport, Richard. \\"Murray, Sir James (1788‚Äì1871)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, online edition, January 2016. Retrieved 27 January 2016 =Milk of Magnesia= In around 1809 Murray developed the foundations of a fluid magnesia, which was widely promoted as a stomach aid. Its base ingredient, Magnesium sulfate, had long been known for its benefits in digestion and as an aid for constipation. Murray named his recipe Fluid Magnesia, and set up the company Sir James Murray & Son to successfully market it. Fluid Magnesia was later sold as a solution and recommended as a palatable laxative and as a remedy for acidity, indigestion, heartburn, and gout.\\"Sir James Murray's Original Fluid Magnesia\\", Gloucester Journal, 27 October 1877, p. 3. Along with this, Murray also developed a sweet-tasting mixture in the form of syrup which was designed to mix in with the fluid. This gave the mixture a pleasant aftertaste, which appealed to women and child patients.\\"Sir James Murray\\", Durham County Advertiser, 8 March 1867, p. 1. He also marketed Sir James Murray's Pure Fluid Camphor, a tonic which was used to aid weak nerves, low fever, spasms, cholera, and diarrhoea.\\"Sir James Murray's Cordial Fluid Camphor\\", Londonderry Standard, 9 June 1869, p. 1. Murray's innovations drew criticisms from contemporaries who thought that he had descended into commerce. Murray never patented his formula internationally, only protecting its rights in the British Empire and its colonies.Hordern, p. 2. This left him susceptible to imposters and he was forced to protect his business by litigation after his rights were infringed on several occasions. Because of its restriction to the British Empire, Murray's assistant, Dinnisford, became wealthy after he popularised the formula after Murray's death.Hordern, p. 3. =Superphosphate fertiliser= James Murray was also interested in the development of fertilizers for use in agriculture. Murray took out patents covering superphosphate fertiliser on the 23 May 1842. On the same day John Bennet Lawes also took out a superphosphate patent. Murray was judged to have the priority patent as he had been working on superphosphate since 1808. Superphosphate is a soluble form of phosphate rock which makes phosphate available to plants. The Irish Fertiliser Industry A History, Mark Cooper and John Davis, Irish Academic Press, 2004, p40. =Honours= Murray graduated as a Doctor of Medicine at the University of Edinburgh in 1829, and became the resident physician to the lord lieutenant of Ireland, Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey, in 1831. Murray was knighted in 1833 by his employer, and received an honorary degree in Medicine from Dublin University the following year. He was appointed as an inspector of anatomical schools in Ireland, and was a member of the central board of health. =Scandal= He travelled to Rome Italy in 1844, where he undertook some studies into the causes of malaria. His research led to his view that the fever was caused by electro-galvanic currents and accumulations. He felt passionate towards his appointment as the resident physician to Anglesey, and subsequently to Anglesey's successors, George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby in 1835, and Viscount Ebrington in 1839. However, Murray's son, John, brought shame on his father by publishing a novel, entitled The Viceroy, which satirised \\"the worms and sycophants of Irish lord lieutenancy\\".\\"Our Library Table\\", Athenaeum, 9 January 1841, p. 35. The historian Richard Davenport- Hines, writing for the Dictionary of National Biography, noticed how the situation could have caused Murray much embarrassment and was probably the reason why, in 1841, the newly appointed Earl de Grey, George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon, dispensed with Murray's services. =Studies in heat and electricity= Murray was the resident physician to the Netterville Dispensary\\"Periscope of the Week\\", Medical Times, 1 April‚Äì30 September 1843, Volume 8, p. 30. and to the Anglesey Lying-In Hospital, Dublin.\\"Notices to Correspondence, The Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal: Exhibiting a Concise, Volume 46, p. 3. He was the first physician to recommend the breathing in of iodine in water vapour for respiratory diseases, and in 1829, he published his Dissertation on the influence of heat and humidity, with practical observations on the inhalation of iodine. This was reissued in 1837, with additions on his technique of tracheotomy operations. His report analysed body temperatures in various diseases, and looked at the effects of heat and fluidity on medicines. It further suggested that dilution aided the effects of most medicines. However, it was the area of electrotherapy that Murray was most interested; he (wrongly) attributed electricity to be the cause of cholera and other epidemics. He further opined that epidemics were a result of disturbances of natural electricity; either depletion or excess of electricity in the nervous system could derange the vital organs. During the cholera epidemic of 1832 he lowered the atmospheric pressure on the external surface of sufferer's bodies using an air pump based on his own design. He also endorsed the medical use of atmospheric pressure in air-baths. He reported his findings in various medical journals and publications. =Personal life= In 1809 Murray married Mary n√©e Sharrock, with whom he had several children. When she died, he married again, this time to Mary n√©e Allen in 1848; they had one daughter. Murray is the great-grandfather of the actor Michael Hordern.Hordern, pp. 1‚Äì2. Murray died at his home in Dublin on 8 December 1871 and was later buried at Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin.

In the game, the player controls Merryn, a young girl who crafts a makeshift submarine to search for her father who went missing while fishing. The game was released in July 2016 on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The retail chain GameStop published the game, under the brand of GameTrust Games, the chain's first foray into such distribution. Plot and gameplay Song of the Deep has the player control Merryn, a 12-year-old girl who loves her father, a fisherman, especially when he tells her tall tales of his adventures. When her father goes missing at sea one day, she has a vision of him being trapped at the depths of the ocean. Determined to find him, she crafts a submarine and gear to explore the ocean, and is startled to see that many of her father's tales were actually true. The game plays as a two-dimensional side-scroller in the style of a Metroidvania game. Areas of the game's world require the player to locate special improvements for Merryn and her equipment to surpass obstacles and explore further. While there are enemies in the game that can harm Merryn, the game is aimed less towards combat and more on exploration and puzzle solving, with some emphasis on the nature of how objects behave underwater. Throughout the gameplay, a narrator tells players Merryn's progress and things seen in Merryn's point of view. The narration is performed by Siobhan Hewlett. Development Insomniac's chief creative officer, Brian Hastings considered Song of the Deep as a \\"passion project\\", wanting to create a heroine that his daughter could look up to. Hastings wanted this heroine to be different from the typical female hero found in video games, which tend to be \\"pretty\\", \\"sexy\\" or \\"badass\\", and instead give the heroine attributes that would reinforce positive qualities about his own daughter, \\"intelligence, creativity, kindness and resilience\\". A further influence for the heroine was the favorable feedback that Insomniac has received over the years from fans, praising with how the developers were able to create characters they could identify with. Song of the Deep was developed by a small, fifteen-person team at Insomniac Games. Hastings compared this team to the original Insomniac team when they were developing the Spyro series, capturing the same enthusiasm and commitment from the team for Song of the Deep as they had before. Hastings found that with the smaller team, working on a new genre and gameplay space than previous titles, developers were often forced out of their comfort zone and would develop novel solution or work closer together as a team to resolve problems, making the group much more cohesive and effective. Song of the Deep narrative was inspired by Irish mythology, and its visual appearance from the Cliffs of Moher. The choice of a Metroidvania-style game, according to Hastings, is \\"just something we've never done and we wanted to\\", noting that the team are fans of this genre and makes a perfect approach for a game about exploring and finding secrets. The approach to the game, focusing more on the exploration of the world rather than combat, was to make the game more like a \\"children's science museum on an alien planet\\". The game is presented interspersed with artbook as if from a children's book, and Insomniac worked with Sterling Publishing to release a companion children's book for the title. The retail chain GameStop published and distributed the game through its stores and on Steam, under the GameTrust Games division. The partnership between GameStop and Insomniac grew from a conversation about a year prior to the game's announcement, between Insomniac's Ted Price and GameStop's Mark Stanley, in charge of the company's development of new ventures. Stanley has spoken to Price about GameStop reaching more directly to players. Price had shown Stanley Song of the Deep, which had already been in development for some time, and their approach to the game's world. The two saw opportunities to work together to promote the title favorably for both companies, and formed the distribution agreement. Price notes that while GameStop has been fully supportive of the effort, Insomniac has full creative control on the title. Stanley affirmed that GameStop is staying out of the creative process, and decisions such as GameStop branding would be made to make sure Insomniac and the game are successful. GameStop also considered using its ThinkGeek marketing division to produce tie-in merchandise for the game. Stanley considers this their first foray into working this closely with a developer directly, and used the experience to explore other potential options for GameStop. Reception Song of the Deep received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. GameStop reported that 120,000 units of the game had sold by August 2016, with about 80% of these from retail sales.

Nanomanufacturing differs from molecular manufacturing, which is the manufacture of complex, nanoscale structures by means of nonbiological mechanosynthesis (and subsequent assembly).Glossary of Drexler's Nanosystems The term \\"nanomanufacturing\\" is widely used, e.g. by the European Technology Platform MINAMMINAM website and the U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI).U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative website The NNI refers to the sub-domain of nanotechnology as one of its five \\"priority areas.\\" There is also a nano manufacturing program at the U.S. National Science Foundation, through which the National Nano manufacturing Network (NNN) has been established. The NNN is an organization that works to expedite the transition of nanotechnologies from laboratory research to production manufacturing and it does so through information exchange,InterNano strategic workshops, and roadmap development. The NNI has defined nanotechnology very broadly,U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative: What is nanotechnology? to include a wide range of tiny structures, including those created by large and imprecise tools. However, nano manufacturing is not defined in the NNI's recent report, Instrumentation and Metrology for Nanotechnology. In contrast, another \\"priority area,\\" nanofabrication, is defined as \\"the ability to fabricate, by directed or self-assembly methods, functional structures or devices at the atomic or molecular level\\" (p. 67). Nano manufacturing appears to be the near- term, industrial-scale manufacture of nanotechnology-based objects, with emphasis on low cost and reliability. Many professional societies have formed Nanotechnology technical groups. The Society of Manufacturing Engineers, for example, has formed a Nano manufacturing Technical Group to both inform members of the developing technologies and to address the organizational and IP (intellectual property) legal issues that must be addressed for broader commercialization. In 2014 the Government Accountability Office noted that America's leadership in nanotechnology was put at risk by a failure of the government to invest in preparing basic research for commercial application.  Background  The realization of the numerous applications and benefits of nano-scale systems in everyday materials, electronics, medicine, energy conservation, sustainability, and transportation has led to research in developing techniques to produce these nano-systems on a larger-scale and at higher rates. Programs and organizations like the NNI and NNN are currently funding research towards designing economic, sustainable and reliable industry-scale nano manufacturing techniques. An example of such technology is the Nanoscale Offset Printing System (NanoOps) which was developed by researchers at the Center of High-rate Nano manufacturing (CHN) in Northeastern University. The NanoOps is a form of directed assembly which is faster and more economic than traditional 3D printing of nanosystems. Ahmed Busnaina, who was the head lead of the project and featured in the film From Lab to Fab: Pioneers in Nano-manufacturing describes the system as a printing press. An etched template with nano wires is dipped in a solution with nano particles which acts as the ink for the press. The nanoparticles adhere to the template when electricity is applied to the solution. The template with the attached nano particles can then be taken out of the solution and pressed onto any material of choice. According to Busnaina, the whole process only costs 1% of conventional manufacturing and can reduce manufacturing time from days to minutes. Another illustrative example is the soft-template infiltration manufacturing technique developed by Nazanin Bassiri-Gharb at Georgia Tech University. This is a bottom-up nanomanufacturing technique for the fabrication of ferroelectric, piezoelectrically-active nanotubes. The method uses electron beam lithography to draw a vacuum on the precursor sol-gel solution, thereby creating a polymeric template. Via this highly scalable and practical manufacturing process the user can produce custom patterns and shapes for numerous applications.  General overview  Nano manufacturing refers to manufacturing processes of objects or material with dimensions between one and one hundred nanometers. These processes results in nanotechnology, extremely devices, structures, features, and systems that have applications in organic chemistry, molecular biology, aerospace engineering, physics, and beyond. Nano manufacturing enables the creation new materials and products that have applications such as material removal processes, device assembly, medical devices, electrostatic coating and fibers, and lithography. Nano manufacturing is a relatively recent branch of manufacturing that represents both a new field of science and also a new marketplace. Research in nano manufacturing, unlike tradition manufacturing, requires collective effort across typical engineering divides, such as collaboration between mechanical engineers, physicists, biologists, chemists, and material scientists. Nano manufacturing can generally be broken down into two categories: top-down and bottom-up approaches.  Nano manufacturing industry  In 2009, $91 billion was in US products that incorporate nanoscale components. More than 60 countries established nano manufacturing industry related programs at a national level between 2001 and 2004. Cumulative funding since 2000 for National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) is more than $12 billion. Table. 1 Nanotechnology Development in the Worlds and U.S. Figure.1 Number of nanotechnology related and non-overlapping application patents. For sustainability point of view, Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is a Nano-scale manufacturing technology using bottom-up and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) manufacturing method. ALD replaces SiO2 dielectric film with Al2O3 dielectric film. ALD industry is already in use in Semiconductor industry and promising in solar cells, fuel cells, medical device, sensor, polymer industries. Nano manufacturing technology allow improvements in food packaging. For example, improvement in plastic material barrier allow customers to identify relevant information. Longer food life and safer food is aimed with self repairing functions as well. Performance of traditional construction materials; steel and concrete improves with nanotechnology. Reinforcing concrete with metal oxide nanoparticle reduces permeability and increase strength. Property of high tensile strength and Young‚Äôs modulus of Nanocarbon additions such as Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and Carbon nanofibers (CNFs), creates denser and less porous material.  Challenges of nano manufacturing  The transitioning of nanotechnology from lab demonstrations to industrial-scale manufacturing has a number of challenges, some of which include: * Developing production techniques that are economic and produce viable yield * Controlling the precision of the assembly of nanostructures * Testing reliability and establishing methods for defect control. Currently, defect control in the semiconductor industry is non-selective and takes 20-25% of the total manufacturing time. Removal of defects for nano-scale system is projected to take up much more time because it requires selective and careful removal of impurities. * Maintaining nano-scale properties and quality of nano-system during high-rate and high volume production as well as during the lifetime of the product after production * Assessing the environmental, ethical and social impacts References Category:Nanotechnology ","title":"Nano manufacturing"},{"id":"49251548","text":"Ivan Devƒçiƒá (born in Krasno near Senj, 1 January 1948) is a Croatian archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rijeka and university professor of philosophy. Early life and education Ivan Devƒçiƒá was born in a small village of Krasno near Senj on 1 January 1948 to Antun and Kata Devƒçiƒá. He finished primary school in Krasno, after which he attended minor seminaries in Rijeka and Pazin between 1963 and 1967. Devƒçiƒá started his higher education at the Rijeka branch of the Zagreb Catholic Faculty of Theology, and finished it at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. He was ordered as a priest of the Archdiocese of Rijeka on 28 June 1975. In 1980, he received a PhD in theology with thesis Der Personalismus bei Nikolaj A. Berdjajew.

He has published several scientific articles and books. In the Archdiocese of Rijeka, he served as Vice-Rector of the Theological Seminary (1980-1985), Rector and Bursar of the Seminary (1985-2000), and a university professor of philosophy (1995-present). On 17 November 2000 Pope John Paul II appointed him Archbishop and Metropolitan. He was ordered on 16 December 2000. The main consecrate was Cardinal Josip Bozaniƒá, and co- consecrates Msgr. Ivan Milovan and Msgr. Mile Bogoviƒá. General outlook Msgr. Devƒçiƒá is considered to be theologically moderate. On Christmas 2013, when the Croatian society was deeply divided on the issue of the 2013 marriage referendum in which it was proposed to change the constitution so it would define marriage only as a union between a man and a woman, Archbishop Devƒçiƒá held a Mass and stated in his homily: > \\"God isn't legitimized only by unity but also by diversity and thus gives us > one Gospel in four different forms. God doesn't like uniformity, he likes > the unity in diversity, a unity that does not exclude, he likes multitude of > expressions and forms. If we were created in the image of God, and the Bible > tells us that we were, we should act same and accept and promote unity in > difference and difference in unity in our life together.\\" This Mass was attended by Prime Minister Zoran Milanoviƒá, who has thus made a precedent by becoming the first prime minister to visit Rijeka Cathedral on Christmas because all of his predecessors traditionally attended Holy Mass held at the Zagreb Cathedral. This was interpreted as Milanoviƒá's protest against the Archbishop of Zagreb Josip Bozaniƒá, who intervened in the political campaign by openly urging people to vote for changing the constitution, as well as because Bozaniƒá criticized Milanoviƒá's government in his homily on 2012 Christmas Mass for introducing sex education in schools.

Plot=Synopsis= An unnamed atheist Japanese salaryman, in the moment of being murdered by a disgruntled subordinate who he had fired due to poor performance at work, is confronted by an entity that declares itself to be God who condemns the salaryman for not having 'faith'. The salaryman disbelieves in its existence, criticises its various statements from his perspective as an atheist and mockingly terms it as 'Being X'. The entity decides to reincarnate the salaryman into a world where he would face sufficiently difficult circumstances to turn to Being X for help. The salaryman is reborn as Tanya Degurechaff, an orphaned girl in an alternate reality's equivalent of Imperial Germany, known as the Empire. According to Being X, if Tanya either does not die a natural death or refuses to have faith in it, her soul will leave the cycle of reincarnation and will be sent to hell for the countless sins that Tanya has committed in her previous life. In search for an escape, Tanya decides to join the Empire's Mage Corps and fight in the war, hoping to reach a high enough rank as fast as possible to remain far from the battlefield, and in this way avoid the risk of being killed. Even if she's now forced to speak with a young girl's lips, Tanya soon turns into a ruthless soldier who prioritizes efficiency and her own career over anything else, even the lives of those beneath her, especially those that get on her bad side. Characters=Empire= ; : : Tanya is a young blonde, blue-eyed girl who is the reincarnation of a cold-hearted, atheistic, and social-darwinistic Japanese salaryman (briefly voiced by K≈çsuke Toriumi in Japanese, and Josh Grelle in English). She is a mage with magical powers that enable her to fly and fire explosive bullets from guns. Compared to others, Tanya has a high latent magical ability, and is the only one capable of using an experimental Type-95 operation orb due to Being X's interference. She controls a battalion of elite mages whose main purpose is to overwhelm enemy forces while also remaining highly mobile and relatively small. Tanya is quite ruthless and intolerant of failings in others, much the same as in her previous life, and employs several extreme punishments and training methods. After she graduated from the War College as one of the Twelve Knights, she was granted the title of von. By the end of TV series her rank is Major. At the end of the movie, she finally gets her dream job working with an office job in the rear for 2 months with a promotion to Lieutenant Colonel, much to her joy and triumph against her hated enemy, Being X. But that joy was short lived when she received a phone call from General Zettour, who informed her that he had put her proposal, titled \\"Unit Usage and Operational Maneuvers in the Current War\\" to use and organized a Kampfgruppe codenamed \\"Salamander\\", which consisted of infantry, armor and artillery, gave her command of the special army and wanted to see her research in action by having her and the 203rd mage battalion return to the front lines once more, much to her shock and horror. ; : :Viktoriya is a Second Lieutenant in the Imperial Army and serves under Tanya Degurechaff, and later becomes her adjutant.

Having served under Tanya during the Battle of the Rhine, Viktoriya is more familiar with Tanya's true personality, to which she shows fear, but also respect. As a result of knowing Tanya, Viktoriya is more able to keep up with Tanya compared to her other soldiers. However, despite knowing Tanya's side character, Viktoriya seems to believe that Tanya actually cares for her subordinates and her harsh treatment of them, is to ultimately ensure their survival. In the manga, Viktoriya's \\"particular\\" point of view of Tanya's character, seem to have started when Viktoriya, during her first true battle, is saved by Tanya at the last second, who (to hide her enjoyment in killing the enemy soldiers) quoted General Robert E.

The hypothesis included a series of reforms in the three pillars of a state: administrative, judiciary and legislative systems. The reforms were enacted through the fourth amendment of the constitution of Bangladesh. BaKSAL was formed as the decision making council to carry out the revolution. The 'revolution', as it was called by the Awami League leadership, ended with the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during the 15 August 1975 Bangladesh coup d'√©tat. History=Background= With the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent nation in 1971, Bangladesh became a people's republic which enabled both democracy and socialism as state policies, with Bengali nationalism and secularism. And within one of independence Bangladesh got its constitution. Bangladesh introduced a parliamentary democracy as the legislative system with 300 constituencies, where every member of parliaments needed to be elected by direct vote by qualified voters. And in the 1973 general election, the Awami League emerged as the single largest party of the country to govern the nation winning 293 seats out of 300. Amid political success, Bangladesh was facing difficulties with the condition of its economy after independence. In the 1974‚Äì75 fiscal year, after three years of independence, Bangladesh hardly registered a 2% growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) while the population grew by 3%, embarrassing statistics for a government. Almost all private ventures were nationalised according to the state policy and private entrepreneurship was discouraged. Though Bangladesh was seemingly advocating socialist ideologies, one of the prime priorities- the land reforms- seemed a far cry. The slower progress in economy, dysfunctional production system, smuggling of goods through the border and syndication among the traders who had been enjoying substantial support, including licenses from the ruling Awami League, since independence led the country to a famine in 1974 that claimed at least 1.5 million lives. Estimates from some notable economists, including Dr. Amartya Sen however, suggest the death toll was much higher. A sudden flood in the same year made the situation much worse leaving hundreds to die of starvation. With these failures, the government started receiving criticism from opposition parties and newspapers. The government had decided to deal the political opposition harshly. Political figures like Siraj Sikder, Mosharraf Hossain, Badal Khan and almost thirty thousand political activists were either extrajudicially killed, or disappeared in three years due to Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini () excesses and police actions. Opposition parties started protesting government repression and some of them opted for armed struggle to defend themselves. At least four members of parliament got killed. The later events suggest that the government, due to the failures in the first three years of independence and the worsening law and order situation of the country, was convinced that democracy was no more the salient theme to put the country in order and a series of reforms was needed. =Origin= When considering the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 as the 'first revolution', the term 'Second Revolution' was first used in the 24 September 1974 edition of the Daily Banglar Bani newspaper which had Sheikh Fazlul Haque Mani as the editor-in- chief. Mani was the nephew of Prime Minister Mujibur Rahman,. Mani advocated the idea of a one-party state with his uncle Mujibur as the head of state, in a series of public meetings of the Bangladesh Awami Jubo League (Jubo League), the youth wing of the Bangladesh Awami League. In October 1974, he addressed several meetings of the League and began publicly advocating the view that the parliamentary system had failed in Bangladesh and another \\"revolution\\" was inevitable. Mani professed his ideas to his uncle, Mujibur, in a private meeting in 1974 as well. He said: Prime Minister Mujibur Rahman first pronounced the \\"Second Revolution\\" in his parliamentary speech after the Fourth Amendment on 25 January 1975. =Enactment= The second revolution began with the enactment of the fourth amendment of the constitution on 25 January 1975. After the fourth amendment of the constitution was passed by majority vote in the parliament Sheikh Mujibur Rahman addressed the parliament members. He said: Ideology Though the Second Revolution was a step forward to a Socialist Bangladesh with formidable economic and administrative reforms, it was much different than the other socialist revolutions of the contemporary world. It was more aimed at achieving some reformist goals than a social change. In his emotional speech on 25 January 1975, Mujibur Rahman explaining the revolution, said: In a meeting with two pioneers of the communist movement in Bangladesh, Rashed Khan Menon and Haider Akbar Khan Rano on 20 February 1975, Mujibur said, Noted political scientist Rounaq Jahan pointed out the idea of the Second Revolution this way: However, Mujibur later mentioned that parliamentary democracy was degenerating into a \\"free style\\", free-for-all democracy and he had to put a stop to it. In a public meeting after the declaration of the constitution of BaKSAL, he said: The remarks of Mujibur indicate that he was irked by the criticism of the opposition parties which he believed was taking place due to the 'free-style' of democracy, and one of the reasons of the Second Revolution was putting an end to it. Components The Second Revolution, according to Mujibur Rahman, was a reformation of the government and the whole system. =Objectives= Mujibur spelled out four objectives of his Second Revolution on 26 March 1975 at the public meeting held at Suhrawardy Udyan. He said, The clearly stated four objectives to create a society free from exploitation through Second Revolution were: * To weed out corruption * To increase production in agriculture and industry * To control population growth * To foster national unity =Features= The basic concept of the reformation included certain features as indicated by the Fourth Amendment of the constitution and the subsequent government orders were: Presidential form of government With the Fourth Amendment of the constitution, through which the revolution had begun in January 1975, Bangladesh converted into a Presidential form of government from a Parliamentary system . In the Fourth Amendment, the entire Chapter I relating to the President, and Chapter II relating to the Prime Minister, and the Cabinet under Part IV were replaced by new provisions. The new system vested executive power in the President, who was to be directly elected. One- party system On 24 February 1975 Mujibur announced the formation of the only legal political party of the country the Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BaKSAL). The announcement automatically abolished all other political parties of the country, eventually made the other parties that did not join BaKSAL outlawed. The constitution of the new party was declared on 6 June of the same year by Mujibur. The formation of the party was a follow up of the Fourth Amendment that gave all the power to the President to form the party through his executive order. It was also provided that the government servant would be qualified to be a member of the national party according to Article 117A(4) of the constitution. Reorganized administrative structure According to the theories of the Second Revolution, the sub-divisions were to become districts with a new administrative council composed of representatives from BaKSAL, members of parliament and government officials. Each administrative council would be headed by a governor who would run the local administration. On 21 June 1975, by a Presidential Ordinance, Mujibur created 61 districts from the existing 19. The governor-designates for the districts were declared on 16 July of the same year. An administrative council was announced to be formed for each thana, composed of the local youth, women, workers, farmers and BaKSAL members. Compulsory multipurpose village level cooperatives Mujibur, at the Bangladeshi Independence Day rally on 26 March 1975, declared that there should be compulsory multi-purpose co- operatives in every village of the country. The co-operatives would be formed in phases, under 5-years plans all 65,000 village would have such cooperatives. Each cooperative would comprise 500‚Äì1,000 families. These cooperatives would be considered as the economic units of the nation. Controlled civil liberties The Second Revolution imposed a greater control over civil liberties, including the basic rights of political activity, freedom of speech and the judiciary. The judiciary was made subservient to the President. Contrary to the previous system, the President was given full authority to appoint judges other than those on the Supreme Court, and to remove any judge including the Chief Justice simply by an order on the grounds of 'misbehavior and incapacity'. On 16 June 1975, around 20 daily newspapers in the four major cities were closed down and only four survived: The Bangladesh Observer, The Bangladesh Times, Dainik Bangla, and Ittefaq. The government took over the four newspapers and appointed the editors as well. Anwar Hossain Manju the editor of Ittefaq, which was one of the most popular dailies of the country, was substituted with Nurul Islam Patwari. Sheikh Fazlul Haque Mani, the nephew of Mujibur was appointed as the Editor of The Bangladesh Times. Outcomes With the reforms under the revolutionary program, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was made the President for an indefinite time since the possible ways to impeach a President were made much harder. The minimum number of votes required to impeach a President was increased to three-fourths from two-thirds of the total number of the members of parliament. Though the revolution was thwarted before putting it in operation, it had infuriated a huge population of the country. Bangladeshis amid their sorrow due to an ongoing famine could not accept it. Many journalists became unemployed due to the sudden closure of almost all the newspapers, though the government arranged a token stipend for some of them. Political parties like Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal, National Awami Party, United People's Party and some other parties had to go underground in the changed system. Ganabahini, the armed section of Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal was made more active after the party opted for going underground. Though the chief of the Bangladesh Army was made a member of the central committee of BaKSAL, a section of the force was agitated by the reforms. In a pre-dawn coup d'√©tat in August 1975, Mujibur the President of the country and the leader of the revolution, was assassinated by a group of military personnel of the Bangladesh Army. Criticism Political scientist Rounaq Jahan questioned the goals of the revolution, writing: \\"It is hard to explain why one would need a revolution to achieve such reformist goals!\\" Though the revolution was aimed to foster national unity, Mujibur has been criticised for not making any visible step to achieve the objective. Only eight out of hundred fifteen posts of the central committee was given to the leaders of those parties who joined the platform of national unity, BaKSAL. In the highest decision making council of BaKSAL there was no participation of any parties other than the Awami League. A. F. Salahuddin Ahmed, a historian, termed the revolution as in truth a political death for Bangladesh.

For over three decades (1973-2005) he taught East Asian history at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota, and currently holds the rank of Professor Emeritus. Kagan was also a founding member of the Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars (CCAS) and sat on the editorial board of its peer-reviewed quarterly journal, the Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars (BCAS), with Noam Chomsky, Herbert Bix, Mark Selden, John W. Dower, and other noted scholars. A provocative study of the origin of the CCAS appears in a study by Fabio Lanza (2016) entitled America‚Äôs Asia? Revolution, Scholarship, and Asian Studies. In 2001, the BCAS changed its name to Critical Asian Studies.  Taiwan independence  Kagan's unpublished PhD dissertation on Chen Duxiu Èô≥Áç®ÁßÄ and Chinese Trotskyism provides an iconoclastic view of culture, revolution and polity in early 20th century China. The work was among the first to reference Antonio Gramsci's theoretical contributions to comprehending the political economy of revolutionary China. Kagan lived in and studied Chinese language in the Republic of China (Taiwan) from 1965 to 1967, and this initial experience served as the springboard for a lifelong commitment to furthering civil and political rights in Taiwan. Among Kagan's published materials on Taiwan are an introduction to Ross Y. Koen's book The China Lobby in American Politics (1974), and two seminal biographies of Taiwanese leaders Lee Deng-hui and Chen Shui-bian. Kagan's first trip to the People's Republic of China was in January 1975, and since then he has traveled frequently to both mainland China and Taiwan.

A huge renovation project had taken place in Canon Sharpe‚Äôs incumbency, but the structural difficulties of the Church building were ongoing problems. Constant vigilance and regular expensive maintenance still are necessary to keep the building in good order. During Canon Willie‚Äôs incumbency the heating system was renewed, the Church redecorated, masonry work refurbished and repointed where necessary, the fine three manual organ by Conacher was rebuilt by Nicholsons of Malvern, re- emergence of dry rot dealt with and a storage area made under the southwest aisle. As part of the wish to enhance the beauty of the Church, quilted banners depicting the life of St Mark were commissioned. These were designed and made by church members, Mr Terry Wooff [who was also a Lay Reader in the Parish], his wife Ida, and Mrs Myrna Brown. They hang on the balcony. Plaques, in danger of being lost forever, relating to the history of the City of Newport were recovered and placed in the Church. The Church Hall, some distance away from the Church, was at the mercy of vandalism and in need of considerable expensive work to bring it up to the required health and safety standards of a public building. It was sold and the money raised, together with the proceeds of parish fundraising events, used to revamp the interior of the Church including alteration of the vestries to provide a buttery kitchen, secure vestry space and a meeting room. This work was completed in the summer of 2013. Other plans such as the removal of pews to create a community meeting space in the Church were held up until the diocesan authorities agreed to the changes. There was also a need to raise funds elsewhere to enable the work to be completed. The time this took to achieve meant that Canon Willie, who took compulsory retirement at the age of 70 in 2013, did not see his vision come to fruition in his incumbency. In 2014 the Revd Dr Paul Thompson was appointed and the parish went full circle by becoming joined again with the Cathedral as the parish boundaries were realigned. It is now considered the parish Church of the Cathedral ministry area with the Cathedral a stand-alone entity. Canon Thompson has brought his unique gifts and plans to boost up the parish and build on the groundwork done by his predecessors.\\"Vicar has plans to boost Newport church\\", Church in Wales, 30 September 2014.

Registered in the State of New York, the arts foundation was formed to administer the Bellosguardo property according to the provisions in the will of Huguette Clark, who died in 2011 at age 104. Well known in her later years for being a recluse, she was an artist, art collector, and philanthropist, the youngest child of Sen. William A. Clark. The great home sat furnished but unvisited by Huguette Clark and her mother after approximately 1951. The staff was under orders to keep the home as it was, and automobiles remained in the carriage house with 1949 license plates, as described in the Clark biography Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune by Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell, Jr. After receiving the Clark property in 2018, the foundation hosted an inaugural fundraiser at the mansion on October 13, 2018, with more than 500 people paying $1,500 or more to attend. Although the home is not yet open for regular tours, the Bellosguardo Foundation's website describes its vision of the future: \\"Now, Huguette has bequeathed the property to the Bellosguardo Foundation, which is committed to both honoring the Clarks' past, and building a future where the estate can be enjoyed by all as a focal point for the arts. Realizing that future will take time and commitment, but the fruits of that labor will be well worth the effort. Be it coming up to enjoy a family picnic by the rose garden, delve into the estate's history, view art from institutions around the world, or take in a jazz recital on the lawn, Bellosguardo will become a new home for art, music, history, and culture on the California coast.\\" Estate history The sprawling estate on more than twenty-three acres overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Bellosguardo was the Clark summer home. It was named Bellosguardo, meaning \\"beautiful lookout\\" in Italian, by the previous owners, the William Miller Graham family. The Clark family bought the property and its Italianate mansion in 1923. Senator William Clark died in 1925. After the 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake damaged the home, his widow, Anna Clark, Huguette's mother, had a new 22,000-square-foot mansion built in a French style, designed by Reginald Davis Johnson, completed in 1933. The property has 1,000 feet of ocean frontage. In 1928, Huguette was married at the original Bellosguardo mansion in a private ceremony. Huguette's husband, William Gower, was a Princeton graduate and the son of William Clark's top accountant. They were divorced in 1930. She also was instrumental in cleaning up the 42-acre saltwater marsh across East Cabrillo Boulevard from Bellosguardo, now a lake known as the Andr√©e Clark Bird Refuge. The refuge is named for Louise Amelia Andr√©e Clark, her older sister, who died of meningitis in 1919, a week before Andr√©e's 17th birthday. In 1928, Huguette Clark donated $50,000 to the city of Santa Barbara to excavate a pond and create an artificial freshwater lake. She donated more funds in 1930 and 1989. Andr√©e is also remembered on the Bellosguardo property with a rustic thatched-roof cottage, built by the Grahams, that was renamed Andr√©e's Cottage. Huguette Clark inherited Bellosguardo from her mother in 1963, issuing two instructions to staff: Keep everything in first-class condition, and make no changes. Organization Huguette Clark died in New York in 2011 at the age of 104, and, in her will directed that the property be given to a new Bellosguardo Foundation for the fostering and promotion of the arts. The nonprofit foundation, which was formed after a contest over the will with the help of the New York Attorney General's Charitable Division Bureau, will work to determine the future of Bellosguardo. It was 2018, seven years after Clark died, before her Bellosguardo property was transferred to the foundation, after settlement of the dispute over her will as well as negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service about gift taxes due. In addition to the property and any furnishings and art in the home, Bellosguardo received Clark's extensive doll collection (valued at nearly $2 million). A public auction was scheduled in January 2020 to sell the dolls for the benefit of the foundation, with a small number of dolls to remain on display at Bellosguardo. =Leadership= The legal settlement of the Clark estate called for one board member to come from the Clark relatives who challenged Huguette's will, and one from the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, and one from her attorney in Santa Barbara, Jim Hurley. The rest of the trustees are nominated by the mayor of Santa Barbara. All are approved by the New York attorney general. The family representative on the board is Ian Devine, for whom Huguette was a great-grand-aunt. The foundation's President is Jeremy Lindaman, who was a political consultant to former Santa Barbara Mayor Helene Schneider, who nominated most of the original board of trustees. The foundation's latest annual tax return shows Lindaman's salary is $75,000 per year. =Trustees= As of September 2019, the trustees are: * Dick Wolf, film and television producer, chair * Sandi Nicholson, community philanthropist, secretary * Jack Overall, Dantz Development Corporation (ret.)/community philanthropist, treasurer * Stephen Clark, vice president and general counsel, J.

The film was released by Video Services Corporation in Canada in September 2014 and was released in the United States in March 2016. Plot Dirty Singles is a feature-length comedy-drama about a community of friends a few years after university. It's about that time in your life when you're in your first real job and your first real adult relationship‚Äîthe one you think might just last forever. In this clique of friends, Jack-and-Megan, the perfect couple‚Äîperfect house, perfect jobs, perfect hair‚Äîturn out to be not so perfect. This revelation sends a shock through their little world, and soon the ‚Äòbreak-up virus,‚Äô and its after-effect, the ‚Äòinappropriate hook up virus,‚Äô make their way through the rest of the characters. But somewhere in this year of living ridiculously, playing grown-up must become being grown- up‚Äîand the same-old, same-old you thought would last forever proves to be as fleeting as the pop songs of three years ago. Dirty Singles is a naturalistic coming-of-age movie about twenty-somethings generally‚Äîand specifically it's about young adults who happen to live in and around Parkdale in Toronto as they take their first faltering, glorious steps toward maturity. CastProduction The film was cast in October‚ÄìNovember 2012 and shot in December 2012 over fourteen days and thirty-one locations in the Dundas-Ossington area. Release The film premiered at the 2014 Calgary International Film Festival.

Critical reception Dirty Singles has received generally positive reviews from critics. Eric Volmers of the Calgary Herald writes, \\"Dirty Singles works because it is believable, written with an ear for natural dialogue and performed seamlessly by the cast.\\" Steve Gow of the Metro News comments that \\"Dirty Singles is a well-balanced movie that‚Äôs reminiscent of such multi-layered rom-coms as Love Actually and Crazy Stupid Love.\\". \\"The characters are real people,\\" remarks Jude Klassen in Movie Entertainment Magazine, \\"sometimes gorgeous, and sometimes a little hung-over and defeated. The dialogue is deadly sharp without being overtly honed, a credit to both the writing and the acting.\\" And Bruce DeMara of the Toronto Star, in a three-out- of-four starred review, writes, \\"The dialogue crackles throughout with profanity, wise cracks and well-observed truisms as the players variously grapple with infidelity, STDs and achieving orgasm.\\" Reviewers consistently singled out the performances of Lauren Ash and Ennis Esmer, who were nominated for multiple awards for their performances as Carol and Sean, winning Best Female Performance in a Feature and Best Male Performance in a Feature respectively at the 2015 Canadian Comedy Awards.

From the first crop of the foals sired by Secretariat, he showed great promise as a two-year-old when he won two of his three races including the Group One William Hill Futurity. In the following year he finished third in the Derby Trial Stakes but finished unplaced in his three subsequent races. He later stood as a breeding stallion in Florida with limited success. Background Dactylographer was a bay horse with a white star and white markings on his hind feet, bred in Kentucky by the Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos. He was from the first crop of foals sired by the 1973 Triple Crown winner Secretariat. His dam, Artists Proof was a high class racemare who won the Pocahontas Stakes and finished third in the Kentucky Oaks. She was descended from the broodmare Lalun who won the Kentucky Oaks and produced both Never Bend and Bold Reason. Artists Proof was in foal (pregnant) to Secretariat when she was offered at the Keeneland Fall Breeding Stock Sale in November 1974 and was bought for $385,000 by Niarchos: Dactylographer was born the following April. The colt was sent to race in Europe and was trained throughout his racing career by Peter Walwyn at Lambourn. Racing career=1977: two-year-old season= Dactylographer never contested a maiden race and began his racing career in the Philips Electrical Stakes over seven furlongs at Ascot Racecourse in late September. He started slowly but finished well to take second place behind the Jeremy Tree-trained Home Run, with the future Irish St. Leger winner M-Lolshan in third. Fifteen days later he started favourite in a thirteen-runner field for the Sandwich Stakes over the same course and distance. After taking the lead a furlong and a half from the finish he drew away in the closing stages to win by four lengths from Valour, a colt who went on to win the Grosser Preis von Baden. His win was the first for Secretariat in Europe. At the end of October, Dactylographer was moved up in class for the Group One William Hill Futurity over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse. Ridden by Pat Eddery, he started 100/30 second favourite behind Home Run in a twelve-runner field which also included Ile de Bourbon, Hawaiian Sound, Julio Mariner, Orange Marmelade (runner-up in the Prix Saint-Roman) and Whitstead (later to win the Great Voltigeur Stakes). Dactylographer took the lead three furlongs out, got the better of a sustained struggle with Home Run and held off the late challenge of Julio Mariner to win by a neck. =1978: three-year-old season= Dactylographer began his second season in the Derby Trial Stakes over one and a half miles on heavy ground at Lingfield Park in May and finished third behind Whitstead and Son Fils. At Royal Ascot in June he contested the King Edward VII Stakes and finished fifth behind Ile de Bourbon. He recorded his only success of the season in a minor race at Lingfield in August, winning by four lengths from the five-year-old Dutch Treat. On his final appearance he was moved up to one and three quarter miles for the March Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse and finished fourth of the five runners behind Le Moss. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1977: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland, and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the British Free Handicap, Sporting Yankee was given top-weight of 120 pounds, thirteen pounds behind the top-rated Try My Best. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 119, making him eleven pounds inferior Try My Best. In their annual Racehorses of 1977 Timeform described him as a \\"tall, rather lightly made\\" juvenile who was likely make a good stayer. Timeform gave him a rating of 115 in 1978. Stud record After his retirement from racing, Dactylographer returned to the United States to become a breeding stallion and was based at Comfort Acre Farm in Florida. He later moved to the nearby Flying \\"M\\" Acres, where his handler described him as being \\"crazier than a bedbug\\". The most successful of his offspring was Ronbra whose 19 wins included the Grade III Pennsylvania Governors Cup. Dactylographer died at South Star Ranch in Texas on 31 October 1996 at the age of twenty-one.

Located along the walls of Florence, near the Porta San Giorgio, in the south-west of the city, it is also known as the Baluardo della Ginevra, due to the presence at one time of a nearby spring called the Ginevra.  History  1584 map of Florence by Stefano Buonsignori, detail of Baluardo a San GiorgioThe rampart abuts a section of the medieval city walls that from the Porta San Giorgio descends to that of San Miniato. This stretch belongs to the circle of 1258, as the Porta San Giorgio, which is the oldest of those still preserved in the city. This section of the walls was reviewed and restored, but not essentially altered at the time of the construction of the last circle from the late '200 and early' 300. The Baluardo a San Giorgio was built at the behest of Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1544 on one of the ramparts designed by Michelangelo Buonarroti during the siege of Florence in 1529-30. The idea to build a fortress in this location was already proposed by Niccol√≤ Machiavelli. The current bulwark is part of a massive effort to upgrade the city's military, together with other strongholds, now largely disappeared, which aimed to reinforce some key points along the medieval walls of the city. The bulwark encompasses one of the towers and a section of the heavily angled walls themselves; some artillery emplacements are preserved here, cut into the medieval wall during construction of Michelangelo's bastion.  Modern times  The area, property of the Commune of Florence, is now the headquarters and shooting range of the Balestrieri Fiorentini, the Florentine Crossbowmen who participate in the Procession of the Calcio Storico Fiorentino. The Balestrieri Fiorentini look after the maintenance of the bulwark, preserving it as it has been handed down through history. The Palio is a traditional Florentine festival that includes a shooting competition from the distance of 25 meters with traditional crossbows, in which eight companies of archers participate. Dressed in medieval clothing, these competitors are from various towns of Tuscany, Marche, Romagna and Abruzzo.  Bibliography  * Anichini, Luca.

Gillstrom. It stars Bing Crosby as himself along with Vernon Dent and Mary Kornman. Plot Elmer Smoot and Bing Crosby both have a crush on vocal teacher Beth Sawyer, who is sponsoring an upcoming music recital. Smoot is an aspiring singer who hopes to run Bing Crosby off the radio, though he doesn't realize Crosby's identity when he meets him. They become bitter rivals for Sawyer's affection. At the recital, as Smoot sings the old-fashioned song \\"Dear Old Girl,\\" Crosby's dog runs loose onto the stage and ruins Smoot's performance. Though Crosby didn't intend for this to happen, Sawyer is embarrassed and angry. Crosby, using the pseudonym of Howard Jones, croons the song \\"I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance with You\\" and wins the audience over. Sawyer is pleased. While Crosby sings, Smoot finds a signed photograph of Bing Crosby and notices the resemblance between him and \\"Howard Jones\\". When the song is over, he rushes to the stage and informs the audience that Howard Jones is indeed Bing Crosby. This amuses the audience, and Sawyer is humiliated. Later, Sawyer is surprised by Crosby singing \\"Please\\" through her window. Sawyer forgives him, and they kiss. They drive away passing a garage where Smoot is destroying what he erroneously thinks is Crosby's car.

A rival, Vernon Dent, pulls various pranks to eliminate Crosby, but only makes things worse for himself, with Crosby finally coming through, not only as the star crooner, but also in a romantic way.\\" In Los Angeles where Bing had recently been appearing, the reception was enthusiastic too. \\"Two shorts, Bing Crosby in Please and a Popeye cartoon almost run the main feature off the screen.

Clark (1839‚Äì1925), one of the wealthiest men in the world at the time. The book chronicles both William and Huguette's life, including Huguette's decision to live the last 20 or so years of her life in hospitals in New York City, despite owning multiple homes and a fortune worth more than $300 million. Empty Mansions debuted at Number 1 on The New York Times bestseller list for e-books, and Number 4 for hardcover books, for the week ending September 14, 2013. It was on the New York Times bestseller list for 13 weeks, and on the Los Angeles Times bestseller list for 37 weeks. Empty Mansions also appeared on bestseller lists from Publishers Weekly, IndieBound independent booksellers, National Public Radio, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today and Maclean‚Äôs magazine in Canada. Originally published in the United States and Canada, Empty Mansions has been published in translation in China, Brazil, and Italy, and also published in English in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries. Overview William A. Clark House in New York City Huguette was the daughter of self-made copper industrialist William A. Clark, who was nearly as wealthy as John D. Rockefeller in his day. Clark was a controversial senator, builder of railroads, namesake for Clark County, Nevada, and the founder of Las Vegas. Huguette grew up in the largest house in New York City, the William A. Clark House at 952 Fifth Avenue, which was unimaginably luxurious with 121 rooms for a single family of four. She owned paintings by Edgar Degas and Renoir, a world-renowned Stradivarius violin, and a vast collection of antique dolls. During her life, she used her wealth to buy gifts for friends and strangers alike while quietly pursuing her own calling as an artist and guarding the privacy she valued above all else. The book and the Clark family story encompass nearly all of American history in three long generations, from a log cabin in Pennsylvania to mining camps in the Montana gold rush. From corrupt politics in Washington, DC to an emergency call from the largest single apartment on Fifth Avenue. The book weaves together Huguette's seemingly charmed life through her personal history including possession of a first-class ticket and stateroom on the second voyage of the Titanic to the anxiety nine decades later of the terror attacks on 9/11. Empty Mansions uncovers an elusive portrait of the mysterious Huguette, her intimate circle including her infamous father, publicity-shy mother, star-crossed sister, French boyfriend, her nurse who received more than $30 million in gifts, and the relatives fighting to inherit Huguette‚Äôs fortune. The book contains more than seventy photographs, many never before seen outside of the family. Empty Mansions is the story of a woman who has been described as the \\"last jewel of the Gilded Age\\" and who lived life on her own terms. Research In 2009, Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning journalist Bill Dedman was looking at real estate in New Canaan, Connecticut and came across a listing for a very expensive home that had been unoccupied for nearly sixty years, but fully maintained. From there he began his research that led him to Huguette Clark and into American history that was still being lived out. After publishing his initial story on NBC.com, Dedman was led to Paul Clark Newell, Jr., Huguette Clark‚Äôs cousin and one of the few relatives who had any contact with her. Together, Dedman and Newell (1936‚Äì2016) collaborated, combining Dedman's findings with years of family research by Newell, telling the tale of a bright, talented woman born into a family of extreme wealth and privilege who voluntarily removes herself from the outside world to live a life of relative seclusion.

It had antisemitism as its ideological basis. The initial German Reform Party was established in 1880 by Alexander Pinkert, a Saxony-based antisemite, as a strongly antisemitic and palingenetic party, advocating the elimination of the Jews and the rebirth of Germany. However this initiative only lasted until 1891.Matthew Lange, Antisemitic Elements in the Critique of Capitalism in German Culture, 1850-1933, Peter Lang, 2007, pp. 126-127 The later version of the DRP was established in either 1889 or 1890 by Otto B√∂ckel and Oswald Zimmermann, who had been involved in the original party, under the name Antisemitic People's Party.Richard S.

Foster, U. of California: In Memoriam, 1995 He was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley from 1934 until 1971. In 1932 he was an Invited Speaker at the ICM in Z√ºrich. In 1934 he accepted a regular position at Berkeley. At that time Griffith Evans was Head of the Mathematics Department and was charged by President Sproul with building a first-class mathematics center, which he did. Alfred Foster and Charles Morrey (who became the first department chairman after Evans' retirement) were Evans' first two appointments. Except for subsequent sabbatical leaves, spent most notably in Freiburg and T√ºbingen, Foster served continuously at Berkeley until his retirement at the then-mandatory age of 67 in 1971. Foster's Ph.D. dissertation and his first few papers were in the area of mathematical logic. Starting from this point, he soon focused his interest on the related theory of Boolean algebras and Boolean rings, and was thus led from logic to algebra. He extensively studied the role of duality in Boolean theory and subsequently developed a theory of n-ality for certain rings which played for n-valued logics the role of Boolean rings vis-a-vis Boolean algebras. The late Benjamin Bernstein of the Berkeley mathematics faculty was his collaborator in some of this research. This work culminated in his seminal paper ‚ÄúThe theory of Boolean-like rings‚Äù appearing in 1946. Foster was married to Else Wagner; their marriage produced four children and eight grandchildren.

Biography  Daryabeigi was born in Rasht in northern Iran in 1930. He studied and attained bachelor's degrees in both World History and Geography from Tehran University. After receiving his degrees he studied the composition and techniques of art at the studios of both Marcos Grigorian and Ali Azargin. He first exhibited his work in 1960, and receiving a special mention in a 1968 exhibition organised by UNESCO. Years later he took a further degree, in lithography, at the University of Salzburg in Austria. In 1975, Daryabeigi joined a group of artists who called themselves \\"The group of independent artists\\". The group developed the foundation that would define techniques and styles to be practiced in Iranian art for future generations to come. The group consisted of Marcos Grigorian, Morteza Momayez, ·∏†olƒÅm-·∏§osayn NƒÅmi, Massoud Arabshahi, Faramarz Pilaram, and SirƒÅk MalkoniƒÅn. The group held several significant exhibitions for the next four years, including ƒÄbi (Blue) and Gonj o gostareh (Volume and environment). In 1979, Daryabeigi moved to Paris, then in 1986, moved to Nogent-sur-Marne on the outskirts of Paris. He continued to live and create art in France until his death in 2012. Daryabiegi had many solo exhibitions, and also exhibited his art at celebrated and respected international galleries  Artistic style  The bare canvases he exhibited in the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1973 show the vast spaces of his native Iran, and the beauty of the infinite landscapes. In 2012 he exhibited in the Maison Nationale almost abstract cold, pale landscapes.  Galleries  In 1962, Daryabeigi opened his first gallery, in Tehran. He named the gallery MESS, the Persian word for copper. This was one of the first independent art galleries in Iran to deal specifically with visual and graphic art. Alongside his own work, which was kept on permanent display, Daryabeigi regularly presented the work of other Iranian painters from a variety of different artistic backgrounds. By introducing these artists to the public, the MESS Gallery, under Mr. Daryabeigi's leadership, was considered as representing the country's contemporary art at the time, and encouraged the next generation of abstract Iranian painters. He opened his first gallery in France in Nogent- sur-Marne, soon after moving there in 1986.

It is the only remaining covered bridge in the Five Rivers basin. Former covered bridges within of Fisher were the Buck Creek Bridge (1924) and the Cascade Creek Bridge (1927), both long. Conflicting county records give the date of construction as either 1919 or 1927, but the county's official date is 1919. Features include semi- elliptical portal arches, ribbon windows under the eaves, and flared side walls. The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Scheduled for demolition in the 1970s after replacement by a concrete bridge, the Fisher School Bridge was preserved by the local community with the aid of Lincoln County. In 1998, an inspection showed that the bridge had become unsafe and would need to be demolished or renovated.

The PomBase website was redeveloped in 2016 to provide users with a more fully integrated, better-performing service (described in ).  Data Curation and Quality Control An overview of data provided by PomBase and ways to access it. PomBase staff manually curate a wide variety of data types using both primary literature and bioinformatics sources, and numerous mechanisms are employed to ensure both syntactical and biological content validity. Types of data curated include: * Genome sequence and features (e.g. physical location of genes in the genome) * Protein and ncRNA functions, the cellular processes they participate in and where they localize * Phenotypes associated with different alleles and genotypes * Specific protein modification sites and when they occur * Human and budding yeast orthologs of S. pombe genes (manually curated dataset) * Metadata of datasets loaded into the genome browser * Disease associations for when the human ortholog is known to cause disease * Data regarding when specific genes are expressed * Complementation data for where there is functional complementation between a fission yeast gene and a gene from another organism * Subunit composition of complexes  Data Organization  Gene annotation can be viewed either at a gene-specific level (on the gene pages) or at a term-specific level (on the ontology term pages). This makes it possible to either: * View all annotations created for a gene, for example pat1 * View all genes annotated a term, for example cytokinesis * View all annotations created from a specific reference, for example Chica et al. 2016 Genome-wide datasets (including protein datasets, all annotations, manually curated ortholog lists etc) can be accessed from the datasets page. Datasets suitable for display in a genome browser and that have been loaded can be accessed via the PomBase JBrowse instance. PomBase uses several biological ontologies to capture gene-specific information, including: * Gene Ontology (GO) - used to describe the enzymatic functions, biological roles and cellular locations of gene products * Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO), Used to associate phenotypes with alleles of genes, in comparison to the phenotype of the reference strain * Sequence Ontology - used to describe DNA or protein features * Protein modifications - using PSI-MOD  Gene Characterization Status  The GO slim page provides an overview of the \\"biological role\\" of all \\"known\\" fission yeast genes - these are proteins that have either been experimentally characterized in fission yeast, or in another species and transferred by orthology. Remarkably, nearly 20% of eukaryotic proteomes, from yeast to human, are uncharacterized in terms of the pathways and processes that these proteins participate in , making it one of the great unsolved problems in biology. The role that these proteins play in biology, have not yet been discovered in any species. To aid research into these unknown proteins, PomBase maintains an inventory of uncharacterized fission yeast proteins. The priority unstudied genes list represents the subset of uncharacterized fission yeast genes that are conserved to man, making it an especially high priority research target.  Community co- Curation  To supplement the work of the small team of professional PomBase curators, fission yeast researchers contribute annotations directly to PomBase via an innovative community curation scheme, for which an online curation tool, Canto, has been developed. Community curation is reviewed by PomBase staff, and this results in highly accurate, effectively co-curated, annotations. PomBase maintains an annotation stats page.  Knowledgebase Updates  * News updates on the PomBase homepage * Posts to the research community mailing list * NAR ([Nucleic Acids Research]) database updates * Tweets (@PomBase) * Facebook group * Linkedin group  Documentation  Pombase provides both documentation and an FAQ. Usage of PomBase as a research tool is explored in the \\"Eukaryotic Genomic Databases\\" (Methods and Protocols) book chapter. Developments and updates are described in the NAR Database Issue papers.

It is a small shrub with hairy, grey foliage and attractive deep pink to red flowers usually growing in mulga woodland. Description Eremophila glandulifera is an erect shrub growing to a height of between and which has lumpy, hairy branches. Its leaves are mostly long, wide, lance-shaped to egg-shaped and greyish due to a dense covering of star-like hairs. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a hairy stalk, usually long. There are 5 green to purple sepals which are mostly long and hairy on both the inner and outer surfaces. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The tube is deep pink to red with deep red spots inside the top and on the lower petal lobe. The tube and its lobes are hairy on both surfaces, most densely inside the tube. The hairs on the leaves, sepals and petals are often branched and tipped with a gland. The 4 stamens extend beyond the end of the tube. Flowering occurs from May to October and is followed by fruits which are woody with a papery covering and long.Leonora Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The specific epithet is from the Latin glandulifera, 'bearing glands', referring to the glandular hairs of this species. Distribution and habitat Eremophila glandulifera usually grows on stony clay or granite soils, often in mulga woodland in areas between Kalgoorlie and the Mullewa - Carnarvon road in the Murchison and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. Conservation status Humped fuchsia bush is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture The pale pink to bright lipstick pink flowers of this eremophila make it an attractive shrub in a garden. It is easier to propagate by grafting onto Myoporum than by cuttings. It prefers a sunny position but is frost tolerant and has been grown in areas of high humidity such as Sydney.

H., from which place he entered Yale College. After graduation in 1861 he was for nearly a year principal of an Academy in Fairfield, Connecticut, and then became a teacher in General Russell's school in New Haven, where he remained until he entered on a tutorship (in Latin) in the College, in January, 1865. July, 1869, he resigned this office, and he spent the next three years in Europe, chiefly in study in Paris and Berlin. Then followed an additional year of study at Yale, for the completion of his course for the Doctorate of Philosophy, which he obtained in 1873. In the same summer he was appointed to the Professorship of Modern Languages in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which he occupied until his death. His life as a teacher was a very busy one, and he broke down in health early in the year 1888. He died at his home in Boston, on November 17th of 1888, after a brief attack of inflammation of the brain, at 49 years old. Professor Otis was married, June 11, 1884, to Sarah Margaret Noyes, of Boston, who survived him with two sons. Otis published a Grammar of Elementary German, which passed through several editions, and edited for the use of his classes a number of German texts.

The rocket barrage, which was launched by Pro-Russian forces from inside Russian territory, killed 37 Ukrainian soldiers and border guards in a camp.  Background  The Ukrainian military camp in Zelenopillya was periodically observed by UAV's. Ukrainian forces were able to shoot down one of them near the camp, it was a Russian-made Orlan-10 drone.  Rocket attack  In the early morning of 11 July 2014, Russian forces fired a barrage of 9K51M \\"Tornado-G\\" rockets in 40 salvos beginning at 4:40 a.m. They targeted an armored convoy of the Ukrainian Ground Forces from a distance of 15 km. The Ukrainian column was camped in a field near the village of Zelenopillya, situated along the main highway to Luhansk in the Sverdlovsk/Leninsky district near Rovenky. The town is located only 9 km from the Russian border. The Ukrainian armored brigades were a part of a main contingent of troops guarding the Ukrainian-Russian border against the illegal movement of military equipment from Russia into Eastern Ukraine. At least 19 soldiers were killed and 93 others were injured in the rocket strike. Four Ural-4320 transport trucks full of troops were struck. According to one Ukrainian soldier's account, the 1st Battalion of the 79th Mykolaiv Airmobile Brigade was \\"almost completely destroyed\\" during the rocket onslaught. Chief physician of a regional hospital, Serhiy Ryzhenko reported the wounded to be in grave condition, with some undergoing traumatic leg amputations and loss of limbs. According to an investigation a year later, 30 Ukrainian soldiers and 7 border guards were killed and over 100 soldiers were wounded during that strike. Ukrainian border guards Colonel Ihor Momot was among the fallen.  Reactions  In response to the rocket strike, Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko held an emergency cabinet meeting and issued a statement condemning the attack and vowing to \\"find and destroy\\" the pro-Russian rebels accountable. He also said for every Ukrainian serviceman's life the militants will pay with \\"tens and hundreds of their own\\". The United States Department of Treasury instituted a new set of sanctions on Russia after reliable evidence emerged that the rockets were fired from within Russian territory. Videos by a resident of the rocket launchers firing at Ukrainian positions, matched the very same Google Maps view of the same physical features inside Russian territory, bordering Ukraine.

The organization was the women's auxiliary of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League and was established to provide health services and education to people of African descent. History In 1920, Henrietta Vinton Davis established the Black Cross Nurses (BCN) in Philadelphia as an auxiliary of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA). The BCN served as the women's auxiliary of the UNIA, placing women in a supportive role, while the men's auxiliary served in a protective role. Marcus Garvey wanted everyone in the UNIA to feel they belonged within the organization, and the BCN served that purpose for women. The BCN was based on the World War I nursing model of the Red Cross. Local chapters were established with a matron, head nurse, secretary and treasurer to provide health services and hygiene education to black members of the community. Few programs existed which would admit people of African descent into nursing training at the time and many health facilities provided unequal care to black patrons; one of the goals of the organization was addressing these discrepancies. Doctors, nurses and lay practitioners took courses ranging from six months to a year to make sure that standardized care was being given. In addition, upon graduation from the course, each member was required to purchase and wear their official uniform. In many ways, the organization functioned as a social reform movement, while developing role models for young women. It promoted education, good health and hygiene, juvenile rehabilitation, maternal and infant care, and training in proper nutrition. It also provided a professional, organized structure for members, giving them a means to appear in roles of public leadership. In articles which appeared in the Negro World, nurses addressed a wide variety of topics from advice to expectant mothers to contagious diseases, heart disease, and hygiene, as well as descriptions of the conditions, symptoms, and treatment options. Benevolent community service included distributing clothing and food to those in need. The requirements of membership were that the women be active members of the UNIA, between 15 and 45 years old and \\"of Negro blood and African descent\\". Nurses were also required to be able to read and write in order to promote literacy in their communities and serve as examples to others. As an overriding goal, the organization used social health concerns to uplift the black race from degeneracy, believing that by creating a sanitary living environment, the community would prosper. Units quickly formed in cities across the United States, as well as in The Caribbean and Central America. In the early 1920s, the United States UNIA organizations spread into thirty-eight states, and membership in the Black Cross Nurses was in the tens of thousands. The largest branch in the world was located in Harlem. Within a few years of the formal organization of the Black Cross Nurses, there were chapters in Alabama, Chicago, California, Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia, with international chapters in Belize, Nova Scotia, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago. By 1927, membership had declined, but the Black Cross Nurses provided education for African-American nurses and health care access to African Americans in their communities through the 1960s. Culture All white uniforms including dress, shoes, stockings and a cap adorned with a black cross encircled by a red background with a green center were worn for dress and official functions. Duty uniforms, consisted of a green dress over which was worn an ivory apron accompanied by black shoes and stockings, set the BCN nurses apart from other nurses and united them as symbolically as members. Green was chosen as a representation of growth and renewal. Criticism of the dress and cape stemmed from a comparison to a nun's habit, while UNIA men's uniforms resembled military attire. Ancillary responsibilities of the BCN included singing in a choir and marching in parades. Choir rehearsals were on Friday. Marching practice was necessary as local chapters participated in parades on holidays such as Memorial Day and the Fourth of July, sometimes carrying the Black Nationalist flag. International chapters=Belize= The Belize Black Cross Nurses organization was established in British Honduras in 1920 by Vivian Seay, who led the organization until her death in 1971. Dr. K. Simon, medical officer for the Cayo District, moved to Belize Town in 1921, and began instructing members of the UNIA in midwifery, to combat the high mortality rates for infants and mothers. He urged that members take instruction under Belize Town Public Hospital matron Lois M. Roberts, an Englishwoman, in general hospital procedures and hygiene. As Roberts had been unable to secure sufficient nurses for her training program, she agreed to accept the Black Cross Nurses. By 1922, seventeen of the first training class of twenty nurses passed their exams and were awarded their nursing certificates. By 1923, there were twenty- four certified nurses, who were each assigned a territory in Belize Town to administer to the needs of the poor, as unpaid volunteers. In the aftermath of the 1931 Belize hurricane, the Nurses helped in the Public Hospital and in relief camps. An annual event called the Baby Exhibition, was a competition to award healthy infants in various age categories and display proper parenting to the populace. It was a popular event which consolidated the public perception of the nurses as professionals, since they chose the contestants, and the approval of the government, since the colonial medical authorities determined the winners. They also conducted studies and research on the health of communities, as well as humanitarian projects like the 1934 Palace Unemployed Women's Fund, aimed at providing groceries to unemployed mothers. Seay, and thus the organization, were staunchly in opposition to universal suffrage. On the one hand, they sought Victorian morality as a means to improve society as a whole and were rigidly opposed to the baser habits of the lower classes while on the other, they expanded women's spheres from within the confines of domesticity. For the first time, middle-class black women, who were trained as nurses, were publicly active and held positions of community leadership. The attempts to control others' morality were not always appreciated and Seay's political involvement and party politics became divisive points, which reflected on the nurses. In the attempt to maintain order, Seay's policies excluded poor and working-class women, while at the same time strengthening middle-class Creole political worth. Though the organization never came under government control, by 1952 the Black Cross Nurses had influenced the health policies of seven of the colonial governors of British Honduras. It was the most active and lasting black organization in the country, and though it lost momentum after Seay's death was revitalized in the 1980s and continues to serve the humanitarian needs of communities in which its members live. =Caribbean= The Black Cross Nursing organizations of Cuba sprang up mostly in the areas which were highly influenced by British West Indians and in company towns like those that existed for the United Fruit Company. The organization in Banes, Cuba, was developed as an avenue to create acceptance and respectability for blacks, promoting pan-Africanism. The organization thrived until 1932 when the combination of economic depression and rising Cuban Nationalism turned toward labor militancy and communism. The Black Cross Nursing organization of Jamaica was organized in 1922. Sarah Grant, who had trained students at Victoria Jubilee Hospital, trained 29 nurses, though their training remained rudimentary and the organization was always a volunteer auxiliary which did not develop into a strong organization. =Canada= In Canada, the Black Cross Nursing organized as a response to denial of black women's participation in World War I efforts to assist wounded soldiers. The women organized to provide medical help including child care services, first aid, health care, nutrition education and other services. Approximately 25% of the black population of Canada joined the Universal Negro Improvement Association of Canada and a high percentage of those members were of West Indian heritage, possibly due to the strong identification of people from the Caribbean with the British colour-class system: white rulers; brown, mixed-race middle class; and black, laboring lower class. However another important factor was the higher education level and political awareness of Caribbean-born immigrants compared with other black Canadians. West Indians who immigrated as a whole were ambitious and wanted to improve their communities. The BCN organization served to reinforce these ideals, moving many black women away from traditional domestic work and labor and into universities, though not in Canada. The majority of Canadian higher education and hospital organizations refused training for black women, forcing them to look to traditional black colleges in the United States. The nurses were a vital part of providing health services to the black communities of Montreal, Ontario, Nova Scotia and other provinces. Throughout Canada, UNIA divisions were established in 32 cities and towns, but almost all had waned by the 1940s.

Cricket flour differs from true flours made from grains by being composed mainly of protein rather than starches and dietary fiber.  Nutritional information  According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, edible insects such as crickets, stick insects, cicada, termites, mealworms and grasshoppers are nutrient-rich food sources. In fact there are nearly 2,000 identified edible insect species to date. They are high in complete protein, unsaturated fat, dietary fiber, vitamins and essential minerals. Also, cricket flour contains nutrients such as the nine essential amino acids, calcium, iron, potassium, vitamin B12, B2, and fatty acids.  Sustainability  Products such as cricket flour are a sustainable and environmentally-friendly source of protein. Crickets grow and reproduce quickly with little maintenance required. Insect food production requirements are based on the 'feed conversion efficiency', this measures the amount of food needed to produce for an increase in weight. Insects, like crickets, require about 1.7 kg of feed to increase weight and it takes 3100 L of water to produce 1 kg of edible cricket protein. This is because crickets are cold blooded and rely on their environment to control metabolic processes rather than food (e.g. body temperature). Insects are beneficial for the ecosystem. They release less greenhouse emission which is toxic for the environment. Insects are more edible. To date, one study has examined the water footprint, taking into account the entire production system, of commercially produced insects. This data showed insects are considered to be 80‚Äê100% edible.[6]  Food Security and Processing  In Western countries, when raised for human consumption, insects are held to the same safety standards as any other food. The Food and Drug Administration, within the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C; Act), states that ‚ÄúThe term 'food' means (1) articles used for food or drink for man or other animals, (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article.‚Äù Thus, with insects falling under said category, they must be safe and may not bear any added poisonous or added deleterious substance that is unsafe. Said items may not be prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions, and must be produced in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for manufacturing/processing, packing, or holding human food. The FD&C; Act also includes requirements that pertain to the labeling of food and preventive controls, as applicable. Manufacturers have a responsibility to ensure that the food they produce for the United States market is safe and complies with the FD&C; Act and FDA‚Äôs implementing regulations. Processing can be done either commercially or locally depending on the popularity in a particular region. The process begins with removing the insides of the insect (optional). Then, they are shipped to become preserved or freeze dried. This is done by using hessian or polypropylene. After, they are completely preserved/dried they are shipped for storage. Insects can be refrigerated or processed into powders. Cricket flour is made with freeze dried crickets. Then, the crickets are baked to make the processing easier. After they are baked, they are ground into very fine pieces. The freezing, baking, and drying makes a dark brown powdery texture.  Cost  Prices will vary depending on location, but the average cost of pre-made cricket flour is around $40 per pound (4,200 to 4,800 crickets). The price is high due to limited commercializing and processors. Cricket flour is sold in limited areas, but mainly online and wholesale stores. The average prices for frozen crickets are about $9 per pound. These can be utilized in personally making cricket flour.  Food products with cricket flour  Pulverized freeze-dried crickets are used in processed food products, such as: * pasta * bread * cookies * snacks (chips, nachos) * smoothies Cricket flour can be utilized as a complete replacement for flour. The taste is very nutty, and cooking quality may change (but not by much).

Its headquarters is currently located in Dnipro.  History  When Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1992, there were three Soviet military districts on its territory. These were the Kyiv Military District, Odessa Military District and the Carpathian Military District. In January 1998, the Southern Operational Command was created from the Odessa MD and the eastern part of Kyiv MD. In 2005, the Southern Operational Association was created from the Southern Operational Command. In October 2013, Operational Command South was created from the Southern Operational Association. In January 2015, Operational Command East was established with control over forces in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhia Oblasts.

He was a Governor of the Bank of England from 1713 to 1715. Early life and family John RudgeRudge was the eldest surviving son of Edward Rudge, merchant of London, and his wife Susanna Dethick, daughter of Sir John Dethick of London. His father had purchased the manor of Evesham in 1664, and represented the borough in Parliament. Rudge was chosen Mayor of Evesham for 1691. On his father's death in 1696, he succeeded to the estate of Evesham Abbey. He married Susanna Letten, the daughter and heiress of John Letten of London on 10 January 1699. Business career Rudge quickly took control of his father's trading interests after his father's death and became a leading figure in the City of London. He was active in the Mediterranean trade, and lent money to the consul at Alicante. In 1696 he was appointed an assistant in the Royal African Company and to the committee of the East India Company. In June 1698 he provided ¬£2,000 towards the incorporation of the New East India Company. In 1700 he signed a petition of merchants trading to Portugal. He was a director of the Bank of England from 1699 to 1711. By 1702 he had sold his stock in the Old East India Company, preferring to invest in the New East India Company, of which he was a director from 1704 to 1708. He was elected Deputy Governor of the Bank of England for 1711 to 1713 and made Governor for 1713 to 1715.Governors of the Bank of England. Bank of England, London, 2013. Archived here. Retrieved 28 January 2016. He subsequently resumed his directorship from 1715 to his death. He was also Deputy-Governor of the South Sea Company from 1721 to 1730. Political career Rudge was elected Member of Parliament for Evesham at a by-election 11 March 1698. He was returned again in a contest at the general election later in 1698. After being returned unopposed in January 1701 he was defeated in the ballot for commissioners of accounts, receiving only 20 votes. He lost his seat at the election of November 1701, when his interest was weakened by a money dispute with his relatives in the town, but he regained it at the 1702 English general election. He was not active on important committees, possibly because of his responsibility as a director of the Bank, and later the New East India Company. He voted on 13 February 1703 for agreeing the Lords‚Äô amendments to the bill extending the time for taking the abjuration oath. On 23 February 1705 he acted as a teller for a clause to be added to the bill prohibiting all trade and commerce with France. Rudge was returned again at Evesham at the 1705 English general election. He voted for the Court candidate for Speaker on 25 October 1705. He was not an active Member in this Parliament and his political stance remained in question. At the 1708 general election he was returned again for Evesham. He supported the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709, and voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. He was returned unopposed as a Whig at the 1710 British general election..

It was built as a psychiatric hospital and functioned as such till the end of 2018. From 2019, the historic buildings and surroundings are being redeveloped as a new residential area. The new neighbourhood is known as Bindesb√∏ll Byen and is planned to hold 1,200 residences in four sections at its completion. The project is designed by Danish architectural firm Arkitema Architects.  History  In 1852, the hospital Helbredsanstalten for Sindssyge i N√∏rrejylland, colloquially known as Jydske Asyl, was inaugurated in Risskov. Previously, psychiatric care had more in common with imprisonment but on 13 October 1847 it was decided by royal decree that a hospital for proper psychiatric treatment should be built in Jutland. The construction was initiated by Frederik Ferdinand Friis but Gottlieb Bindesb√∏ll later took over the process and finished it. Initially the hospital had room for 130 patients but in 1856 and 1861 it was expanded to host 400 patients. During this period the hospital was also changed from treatment alone to a hosting facility for the incurably ill. In 1886‚Äì88, it was expanded again to 468 patients. The hospital has suffered frequent overcrowding and expansion has been continuous throughout the years. In 1857, a church was established by the hospital and in 1892 staff homes were added by architect Hack Kampmann. In the early 20th century, homes for nurses and doctors were built and later in 1968, more homes were added along with new a treatment and research department in a building called Psykiatrisk Institut. In 1976, the hospital was given the name \\"Psykiatrisk Hospital i Aarhus\\" (Psychiatric Hospital in Aarhus) and in the 1990s, it was extensively renovated which further expanded patient capacity. In February 2008, political discussions opened up the possibility that the hospital could be moved to Skejby to the new large hospital complex there. The move was effectuated in late 2018, and by 2019 the buildings and surroundings are being redeveloped as a residential area known as Bindesb√∏ll-Byen.  Architecture  The large attached park (Risskov Park) Bindesb√∏ll created a solution for an institutional complex in the form of a 4-winged rectangular estate with 4 parallel wings. The buildings were constructed in yellow brick with horizontal red bands. The buildings have many details; semicircular brick connectors above white painted glass doors with cast lintels and olive green windows and shutters. Later additions have on the whole respected the original vision.

Founded as an orphanage in 1899 and incorporated as the Maine Children's Home Society in 1901, it began dealing solely with adoptions in 1915. It merged with the Maine branch of The Home for Little Wanderers of Massachusetts in 1962, creating the Maine Children's Home for Little Wanderers. In 1973 it introduced an \\"alternative\\" high school program for pregnant teens and teen parents. History Postcard view of Water Street, Augusta, Maine, c. 1920 The Home originally opened as a private orphanage on April 10, 1899 in Augusta to care for children living on the streets or in financially unstable homes. Funded by donations from local residents, the institution provided food, clothing, and shelter for 28 children in its inaugural year. It was incorporated as The Maine Children's Home Society in 1901. It also began offering an adoption service to help place children who needed homes. By 1915, the expansion of the foster care movement obviated the need for an orphanage and it was closed, but the adoption service continued to operate. In the 1930s, some of the infants waiting for adoption were used as \\"practice babies\\" by home economics students at the Farmington State Normal School. In the 1950s the Home started its annual Christmas gift box program, which sends toys, games, and clothing to impoverished children statewide. On July 25, 1962 the Maine Children's Home Society merged with the Maine branch of The Home for Little Wanderers of Massachusetts, creating the Maine Children's Home for Little Wanderers. The merged institution, now based in Waterville, provided adoption services together with \\"foster care, counseling, diagnostic study, case work with unmarried parents, and summer camp scholarships\\". In 1973 the Home launched its Teen Parent School Program, which offers an \\"alternative\\" high-school education for pregnant teens. The Home acquired a campus with five buildings in Waterville in 2001 with major support from the Harold Alfond Foundation. In 2011 the Home was accredited for international adoption under the Hague Adoption Convention. Services=Adoption services= The Maine Children's Home for Little Wanderers is a licensed private agency for adoptions and child placement. It is one of 10 licensed adoption agencies in the state. The agency facilitates domestic and international adoptions, home studies, post-adoption services, and counseling for birth parents, adoptive parents, and adoptees. It places between 10 and 14 children annually. =Teen Parent School Program= An \\"alternative\\" educational program offers high- school classes, parenting guidance, childcare guidance, and counseling for pregnant teens and teen parents. The majority of students are girls, although classes and support groups are available for teen fathers. Students can enroll for up to four years, attending classes even after they give birth, and child care is available free of charge. In its first 40 years, this program graduated approximately 1,000 students. The program enrolls an average of 20 students per year. =Daycare and early childhood education= The day care and early childhood education program accommodates 55 children annually. =Outpatient mental health counseling= Outpatient mental health counseling is provided for 200 clients per year. =Christmas gift boxes= Toys, games, and clothing are distributed to impoverished children statewide each Christmas season. In 2012 this program benefited more than 1,600 children. =Summer camp scholarships= Summer camp scholarships are provided for over 150 children statewide. Fund-raising The Home runs its own fundraisers and solicits corporate sponsorships. In-house fundraisers include an annual dinner and an annual Lobster Roll Lunch, which in 2014 raised $7,000 for the Christmas gift box distribution. Corporate sponsors include the Ray Haskell Ford Lincoln dealership, which runs an annual ice fishing tournament in support of the Home, the Atlantic Music Festival, and 10 credit unions making up the Kennebec Valley Chapter of Credit Unions. Staff In January 2016 Richard Dorian became executive director of the Maine Children's Home for Little Wanderers. He succeeded Sharon H. Abrams, who joined the staff in 1973 as the first teacher in the Teen Parent School Program and served as executive director from 1992 to 2015. Abrams continues to work at the Home as a volunteer and social worker. Awards The Home received a 2003 Certificate of Achievement and a 2000 Community Service Award from the Mid-Maine Chamber of Commerce, a 1999 Giraffe Award from the Maine Children's Alliance, and a Business of the Year Award from the Waterville Business and Professional Women. Longtime employee and executive director Sharon H. Abrams was inducted into the Maine Women's Hall of Fame in 2004.

Born 7 September 1969, Hayek is a telecoms executive and digital economy specialist who was part of the team that built the first GSM network in Lebanon. Marwan has over 18 years experience in the telecom sector across the MENA region. Education Hayek holds a master's degree in Telecommunications and Electrical Engineering from the Faculte Polytechnique de Mons in Belgium. He attended and participated in several technical, IT and Management trainings including CCL, MEIRC, HEC, INSEAD, MIT & Harvard. Career Hayek started his career with France Telecom in Lebanon ‚Äì Cellis, known currently as Alfa, where he was part of the initial team that built the first GSM network in Lebanon, before joining later on the Orascom Telecom Holding in 1999. Hayek has held several assignments within the Orascom Telecom Group's subsidiaries and its Holding, the latest before his current appointment was in September 2007, where he joined Mobinil - Egypt as VP Technology in charge of both network and IT infrastructure. Prior to Mobinil, Hayek was the CTO of Mobilink in Pakistan (an OTH subsidiary) between June 2003 and September 2007. Between 2000 and 2002, Hayek was part of the team who built Sabafon's network in Yemen in the position of CTO. Under Hayek, OTH grew to over 120M subscribers. Hayek took the helm of Alfa, the first Lebanese mobile operator managed by Orascom Telecom, as its chairman and CEO, since the beginning of March 2010. He led the introduction of the 3G+ technology that was first launched in October 2011 as well as the introduction of 4G-LTE technology in May 2013. The Lebanese internet cable networks do not currently support fibre optics and the introduction of 3G+ followed by 4G-LTE gave access to the Lebanese people to high-speed internet. Since 1999, following the winning of the Management Agreement of Alfa by Orascom Telecom in February 2009 and in addition to his position at Mobinil, Hayek was appointed on the board of MIC1-Lebanon and Orascom Telecom Lebanon. Since November 2014, he also sits at the board of directors of WIS Telecom (an OTMT international carrier subsidiary operating out of Belgium and Italy). The mobile penetration rate in Lebanon is close to saturation, indexed at 94% as per beginning year 2016.  Political Controversy  In 2015 there was a controversy where the Governmental Tender Office claimed that Hayek did not submit the tender for the renewal of Alfa's governmental regulated contract on time and the Prime Minister's office disqualified Orascom from taking part in the bidding. The Shura Council cancelled the decision and ordered the Tender Office to endorse the company's application. The council also urged it to conduct a public and equally competitive bid. The telecom operators in Lebanon are government regulated and have to go back to the Minister of Telecommunications whenever they want to invest in the network. Awards and recognition Hayek has received several awards in recognition of his contributions to the telecom sector's development in Lebanon and the MENA region. In June 2011, he was awarded the Pan Arab \\"Telecommunications Man of the Year\\" title by the \\"Pan Arab Web Awards Academy\\". In 2012, he received the \\"Visionary Entrepreneur Award\\" at the Business Forum 2012 and he was awarded the \\"Golden Order of Merit for Leadership\\" from the \\"Arab Administrative Development Organization\\" (ARADO), an affiliate of the League of Arab States, and \\"Tatweej\\" Academy. For contributions to the advancement of Lebanon's digital economy, Hayek was awarded the \\"Golden Award for Leadership in Digital Economy\\" from \\"Tatweej\\" Academy. He was awarded the \\"International Hisham Jaroudi Championship\\" trophy for support of sports development in Lebanon.

His family were associated with the hundred of Bray.\\"Coats of Arms in Berkshire Churches\\" by P. S. Spokes, Berkshire Archaeological Journal, Berkshire Archaeological Society, Journal 43: 1939, pp. 117‚Äì132 (p. 122). via Archaeology Data Service. Hanger married Mary Coles. His eldest daughter, Anne (or Ann) (died 1754, aged 53), married Henry Hare, 3rd Baron Coleraine, in 1718. She was accompanied by a dowry of nearly ¬£100,000. The couple separated only two years later, without issue, and the barony of Coleraine became extinct upon his death in 1749. The title was revived though in 1762 for Hanger's nephew, Gabriel Hanger, who became the 1st Baron Coleraine of the second creation. Retrieved 26 October 2018. John Hanger's second daughter, Mary, died in 1739 aged 35 and his youngest daughter Elizabeth in 1744‚Äì45 aged 38. Career Hanger was a merchant of Trinity Minories, just outside the boundaries of the City of London but within the liberties of the Tower of London. He was also Deputy Governor of the Bank of England from 1717 to 1719. He replaced Gerard Conyers as governor in 1719 and served as such until 1721 when he was succeeded by Thomas Scawen.Governors of the Bank of England. Bank of England, London, 2013. Archived here. Retrieved 29 January 2016. He was governor at the time when the Bank of England was intimately involved in the financing of the South Sea Company (known for the South Sea Bubble). In November 1720, he and a party of bank officials visited the company and after enquiring into the security it could give, Hanger read a letter informing them that the bank would only provide the first ¬£400,000 of its agreed rescue subscription of ¬£3m, the future proceeds of which had underpinned the share price.Carswell, John. (1993) The South Sea Bubble. Revised edition. Stroud: Alan Sutton. pp. 169‚Äì170. Afterwards, the company's share price collapsed to a new low, the bank's inaction causing, it was said, more families to be ruined than all the actions of the directors of the South Sea Company. In 1871, Hanger featured as a character in W. Harrison Ainsworth's novelisation of those events.Ainsworth, William Harrison (c.1871) The South-Sea Bubble. A Novel. London: John Dicks. p. 75. Death and legacy Hanger died in 1733 aged 77.

In this application, Rh‚ÄìPt oxide is superior to other group 10 catalysts such as platinum dioxide. Furthermore, the catalyst can be used to carryout the reaction with minimal losses of oxygen containing functional groups via hydrogenolysis.

Early political career Jalaluddin was the daughter of politician and Deputy Minister of Agriculture of West Bengal, Abdus Shokur. After her father‚Äôs sudden death in the Legislative Assembly in 1960, Indian Congress Party officials approached Shakila to replace him. Shakila won her first election by a 42,000-sympathy vote majority. thumb Political accomplishments Jalaluddin's ministerial duties were related to schooling, the establishment of rural health centers and battling over-population. In her first term, she developed a statewide curriculum and provided guidance for implementing internationally recognized standards adopted by the Board of Education. In her second term, she directed funding for the construction of accessible clinics in every village within the constituency. She also legalized and promoted the Loop Device for birth control, mainly because of the low cost and lack of availability of the birth control pill. Jalaluddin won two further elections in 1962, and 1967 prior to retiring from political life in 1968. thumb Personal life Jalaluddin was born in Malikpure, 24 South Parganas, West Bengal India on 5 July 1934. Her family home Ferhat Manzil, remains in Mallikpure today, 12 miles from Kolkata, India. She obtained her master's degree in International Affaires in 1959 from Lady Brabourne College (LBC) a women's college located in Kolkata. In 1961, while appointed as Deputy Minister of Social Welfare, she was married to Jal Jalal at the Oberoi Grand Hotel in Kolkata. In 1969, Shakila and her husband immigrated to Canada, where she appeared in The Ottawa Journal and The Free Press Weekly after her arrival. During that time, she remained married for over 54 years, raised a family, and was an active member of various community organizations. Death Shakila Jalaluddin died on 30 May 2015 in Ottawa, after sustaining head injuries from a fall at her home. She is survived by her husband Jal Jalal, her two children, Adam and Tania, as well as two grandchildren, Sabrina and Stephanie, all still living in various parts of Canada. Shakila is laid to rest at Beechwood, Canada's National Cemetery in Ottawa. thumb References Category:1935 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Women in West Bengal politics Category:Indian National Congress politicians from West Bengal Category:Bengali politicians Category:20th- century Indian women politicians Category:20th-century Indian politicians Category:People from South 24 Parganas district ","title":"Shakila Jalaluddin"},{"id":"49255095","text":"Streptomyces halophytocola is a bacterium species from the genus of Streptomyces which has been isolatedfrom the tree Tamarix chinensis in Nantong in the Jiangsu province in China.Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen UniProt  Further reading  *  See also  * List of Streptomyces species  References External links *Type strain of Streptomyces halophytocola at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase halophytocola Category:Bacteria described in 2013 ","title":"Streptomyces halophytocola"},{"id":"49255098","text":"Wesley G.

At the time of his election, he was the youngest mayor in the city's history.http://digitalcommons.providence.edu/history_dissertations/1/ Doorley served as mayor during a time of economic decline and civil unrest. Early life Joseph Aloysius Doorley, Jr., was born in the Mount Pleasant section of Providence, Rhode Island, on October 12, 1930 to Joseph A. Doorley, Sr., and Nora Cannon Doorley. Doorley's father was a Providence city fireman, and Roman Catholic. Joseph Jr. attended the parish school of Blessed Sacrament Church and was a member of the boys choir there. His mother died in March 1936. Doorley graduated from LaSalle Academy in 1949 and graduated 'cum laude' from University of Notre Dame. From 1953 to 1955, Doorley taught civics, algebra, and English full-time at his alma mater, LaSalle Academy. Starting in 1955, he taught days at LaSalle while commuting to Boston College Law School to take night classes. Shortly after opening his law practice, Doorley served on the staff of Governor John A. Notte Jr.. Doorley served on the Providence City Council starting in 1962. Mayor of Providence Doorley came into the mayorship after Rhode Island's Democratic political machine broke with mayor Walter H. Reynolds and put its support behind young the councilman and lawyer. Doorley beat Republican opponent Charles A. Kilvert by a wide margin. Doorley was a rising star in the Democratic Party; in 1970 he ran for national party chairman. Providence under Doorley's early years was one of the first cities to join the federal Model Cities Program and integrate its schools. Doorley became known for his frugal management style. Doorley's cost-cutting measures earned him the nickname \\"No Dough Joe.\\" He was widely expected to run for higher office. However, Doorley's time as Mayor was also marked by desperate economic troubles. Following World War II, the city's population fell from 248,000 to 179,000 as people moved from Providence to the suburbs. Many large downtown department stores closed, and urban renewal moneys from President Johnson's Great Society program eventually ran out. Some of Doorley's accomplishments as mayor included: * Constructed four high-rise towers for the Providence Housing Authority * Pushed for fair-housing laws and antipoverty programs. * Built a 30-story Hospital Trust Tower * Built a $28 million Ambulatory Patient Care building for Rhode Island Hospital In 1969, after a concert by Sly and the Family Stone at the Rhode Island Auditorium was followed by a riot, Doorley banned all rock concerts in Providence; the ban only lasted for a few months. Ironically, after the Civic Center was built a few years later, Doorley needed to encourage rock concerts to come to Providence. =Civic Center= The signature achievement of Doorley's tenure was the Providence Civic Center. After voters refused a statewide bond issue in 1968 to pay for a Civic Center, Doorley pushed for a special referendum in Providence in 1969, which passed. When more money was needed, Dooley pushed for another referendum in 1971. The Civic Center was so closely associated with Doorley, the press called it \\"Doorley's Dream.\\" The Center became a focus of a corruption investigation in 1973. The director of the Center was convicted of soliciting a $1000 bribe from a concert promoter. The lead investigator for this case was assistant attorney general Vincent Cianci, who used the case as a platform to run for mayor against Doorley on an anti- corruption platform. By 1973, Doorley had lost favor with the state Democratic Party leaders, as the Democratic City Committee refused to endorse his 1974 bid for re-election. Doorley faced three Democratic challengers in the primary, winning by about 2,000 votes. Many of the dissatisfied anti-Doorley Democrats defected to support Republican Cianci, helping him win the 1974 mayoral election. Later life Doorley moved to Florida in later life. June 11, 2012 was declared \\"Joe Doorley Day\\" by the Rhode Island General Assembly and a municipal complex at 444 Westminster Street was named in his honor.

It was discovered on 8 February 1994, by Belgian astronomer Eric Elst at ESO's La Silla Observatory in northern Chile. The dark Jovian asteroid has a long rotation period of 44.8 hours. It was named after the Trojan warrior Helicaon from Greek mythology.  Orbit and classification  As all Jupiter trojan, Helicaon is in a 1:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter. It is located in the trailering Trojan camp at the Gas Giant's Lagrangian point, 60¬∞ behind its orbit . It is also a non-family asteroid of the Jovian background population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.8‚Äì5.5 AU once every 11 years and 10 months (4,314 days; semi-major axis of 5.19 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an inclination of 23¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at La Silla in February 1994.  Naming  This minor planet was named from Greek mythology after the Trojan warrior Helicaon, son of Antenor and King Priam's daughter, Laodice. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 26 July 2010 ().  Physical characteristics  Helicaon is an assumed C-type asteroid, while most larger Jupiter trojans are D-types. = Rotation period = In February 2015, a rotational lightcurve of Helicaon was obtained from photometric observations over at total of 12 nights of photometric observations by Robert Stephens at the Center for Solar System Studies in Landers, California. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.18 magnitude (). While not being a slow rotator, Helicaon has a significantly longer period than most larger Jupiter trojans (see table below). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Helicaon measures 32.54 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.050, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous asteroid of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 30.59 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.3.

There are currently five PDUSDs and no DUSDs. The use of these titles was severely restricted by the FY2010 and FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). PDUSDs and DUSDs report, either directly or indirectly, to an Under Secretary of Defense. Current usage=Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense= There currently exist five PDUSDs.

Five of these positions were established by statute of which four required confirmation by the Senate. Others were created by the Department of Defense itself. Four of the DUSDs were designated either by Congress or by DOD to be \\"Principal Deputy\\" for the Undersecretary. These DUSDs were known as PDUSDs. The reporting relationship between the DUSDs and other senior leaders in the department was not uniform. Some DUSDs reported directly to an Under Secretary of Defense, while others reported to a PDUSD, another DUSD, or another Presidentially appointed senior official.ODAM 2010. p. 3, 54; ODAM 2014 p3, figure 3. Four of the five Under Secretaries of Defense had a PDUSD reporting to them, of which two were designated by Congress and appointed by the President. =Intervention by Congress and elimination= In early 2009, concerned about the proliferation of the DUSD title and the lack of clarity of its role in the DOD organization, Senator Carl Levin, then the Chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee sent a letter to the Deputy Secretary of Defense requesting clarification on the role of the DUSD.ODAM 2010. p. 33-34 This letter along with discussions with the DOD led to a provision in the FY2010 NDAA that:ODAM 2010. p. 5 * Established in law () a PDUSD to be the primary deputy to each of the five Under Secretaries of Defense. * Eliminated the DUSD roles that were mentioned in law (or transformed them into other roles). * Directed the elimination of the DUSD role from within DOD by January 1, 2011. * Required the DOD issue a report to Congress on how it intends to eliminate the DUSD role.

The Department of Defense proposed having 10 of the DUSDs report to an Assistant Secretary of Defense and would be changed to Deputy Assistant Secretaries of Defense. This required redesignating a Director as Assistant Secretaries of Defense, in accordance with the reports plan of standardizing titles, under whom four of the former DUSDs would report as well as the creation of a new Assistant Secretary position under whom the other five DUSDs would report. Two positions were eliminated by restructuring responsibilities, and four of the DUSDs were given new titles (Director, Deputy Comptroller, and Chief of Staff).ODAM 2010. p. 17-19.

DOD believed that DUSD was the most appropriate title for these positions, and recommended that Congress amend the allow to allow them to be retained as DUSDs.ODAM 2010 p. 21-22. Congress agreed to most of the changes proposed, redesignated the Director as an Assistant Secretary of Defense and created the new Assistant Secretary of Defense position recommended by the DOD report. However, Congress did not agree that the DUSD position should be retained, outside of the five PDUSDS, but gave DOD until January 1, 2015 to eliminate the remaining five DUSDs.ODAM 2014. p. 2 Of the five remaining DUSDs, three reported to the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence.

The building was completed in 1902 and was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency in the Danish registry of protected buildings and places on 5 April 1988. The building is situated on the west side of Vester All√© close by Vester All√© Barracks and ARoS Aarhus Art Museum. The building has been home to some of the earliest cultural institutions in the city. Colloquially the building is known as Smykkeskrinet (The Jewel Box) for its distinctive shape or as Erhvervsarkivet (The Business Archive) for its long tenure as the home of the Danish National Business Archives.  History  Vester All√© 12 was constructed between 1898 and 1902 as the home of the newly established State Library. In 1928 Aarhus University was established and the State Library became the official library of the new university and was renamed the State and University Library. The added functions meant there was insufficient space for storage and the library functions became scattered to a number of locations. In 1963 the library moved to the new building Bogt√•rnet (The Book Tower) designed by C.F. M√∏ller on the Aarhus University campus. When the State and University Library vacated the building it was taken over by the Business Archives (later the Danish National Business Archive). The business archive had been established by the city in 1946 as an independent historical institution focused on historical documents related to commerce, business and economy. The Business Archive was taken over by the Danish State Archives in 1968. The archive has functioned in a double role as both the national archive of business records and the local archive of the city of Aarhus since then. In 2011 Aarhus City Council had established the Aarhus City Archives with the goal of preserving local history and it moved into Vester All√© 12 which it shared with the Business Archive in close cooperation. In late 2015 the Business Archive was moved to Viborg due to a desire to centralize operations. The local historical records was left to the Aarhus City Archives.  Aarhus City Archives  Aarhus Stadsarkiv (Aarhus City Archives) is the local historical archive for the city of Aarhus and the administrative body for all the local archives in Aarhus Municipality. The archives were established in 2011 but operates under a set of regulations adopted in 2013 by the Aarhus City Council. The city archives primarily collect print or digital documents and data on municipal institutions but also material from individuals, organizations and companies based in the municipality. The City Archives has the position of chairman of the internal municipal archival committee and advice municipal institutions on the use of information technology. The archives is active in cultural cooperation between local archives, museums, educational institutions and municipal administration. The purpose of the archives is to ensure the history of the city can be documented fully and unbiased.  Architecture  The building was designed by architect Hack Kampmann and was constructed between 1898 and 1902. It is prominently situated on a hill overlooking Aarhus River. The building is in National Romantic and historicist style, constructed from red bricks of lime and sandstone with a hip roof and a balcony. It is adorned with many different types of frieze, bands and inscriptions. Above the front entrance is a relief showing a woman watering the Tree of Knowledge and along the eaves is a series of owls, symbolizing erudition and knowledge. The interior features designs by sculptor Karl Hansen Reistrup who also contributed to Aarhus Theatre.

It was a merger between the German Reform Party (DRP) and the German Social Party (DSP). Formation In the early 1890s political antisemitism in Germany was represented by both the DRP (led by Otto B√∂ckel and Oswald Zimmermann) and DSP of Max Liebermann von Sonnenberg, with the latter being closer to mainstream conservative politics than the more radical DRP.Geoff Eley, Reshaping the German Right: Radical Nationalism and Political Change After Bismarck, University of Michigan Press, 1991, p. 246 Both parties had minor representation in the Reichstag, where they co-operated. When a merger was suggested the main impetus within the DRP came from Zimmermann, with B√∂ckel in favour of maintaining separate existences.Robert Melson, Revolution and Genocide: On the Origins of the Armenian Genocide and the Holocaust, University of Chicago Press, 1996, p. 118 Ultimately however the merger was concluded in 1894 and B√∂ckel, who had lost his Reichstag seat the previous year, left politics.Dan S. White, The Splintered Party: National Liberalism in Hessen and the Reich, 1867-1918, 1976, p. 146 A conference in Eisenach proclaimed the merger and the formation of the new party.Herbert A. Strauss, Hostages of Modernization: Studies on Modern Antisemitism, 1870-1933/39, Walter de Gruyter, 1993, p. 142 Antisemitism Antisemitism was the main basis of the party's ideology, uniting at times disparate elements of the group. They were active in 1898 in support of campaigns to restrict the immigration of Russian Jews into Germany and argued that such laws could form the basis of their ultimate aim of removing rights from all Jews in Germany.Jack Wertheimer, Unwelcome Strangers, Oxford University Press, 1991, p. 165 The party sought close links with the German National Association of Commercial Employees, a white-collar worker union that had a strong antisemitic current to its thinking.Heinrich August Winkler, Germany: 1789-1933, Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 254 The DSRP adopted a strong Christian identity to its antisemitism and amongst those to sit for the party in the Reichstag was Karl Iskraut, a Protestant clergyman.Carola Daffner, Beth A. Muellner, German Women Writers and the Spatial Turn: New Perspectives, Walter de Gruyter, 2015, pp. 225-226 It also sought to build up links with the Sittlichkeitsverein, a loose confederation of \\"morality leagues\\" that campaigned against prostitution and in favour of censorship, and whose support was also courted by the German Conservative Party and the Centre Party.Gary D. Stark, Banned In Berlin: Literary Censorship in Imperial Germany, 1871-1918, Berghahn Books, 2013, pp. 61-62 Wilhelm Giese emerged as a prominent member of the group and was especially noted for his criticism of Zionism, an idea that had some support among contemporary antisemites as a possible solution to the \\"Jewish problem\\". In 1899 he ensured that the party adopted the Hamburg Resolutions explicitly rejecting removing the Jews to a new homeland and instead called for an international initiative to handle the Jews by means of complete separation and (in case of self-defence) final destruction (Vernichtung) of the Jewish nation\\".David Cesarani, Sarah Kavanaugh, Holocaust: Hitler, Nazism and the \\"Racial State\\", Psychology Press, 2004, p. 78 The programme helped to lay the foundations for the future Final Solution, a term it used.Strauss, Hostages of Modernization, p. 72 Wider ideology For a time the party organ was Antisemitische-Correspondenz after Liebermann von Sonnenberg had acquired the rights to the paper from Theodor Fritsch. However Liebermann von Sonnenberg's innate conservatism saw the language of the previously radical journal toned down and as a result subscription rates dropped.Richard S. Levy, Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 22 This conservatism made them targets for the left and in 1898 they were criticised in the pages of S√§chsische Arbeiter- Zeitung, a Dresden-based left-wing newspaper edited by Rosa Luxemburg, for their support for monarchism and their veneration of Otto von Bismarck as well as for their internal squabbling. The DSRP responded by branding Luxemburg a \\"Jewish madam\\" in their Deutsche Wacht organ, and her reply to this attack has subsequently been included in anthologies of her writing.Jonathan Karp, Adam Sutcliffe, Philosemitism in History, Cambridge University Press, 2011, p. 172 A populist trend also existed locally within the party. In Hamburg the local branch sought to challenge the Social Democratic Party by campaigning for improved housing, education and trade union rights, as well as antisemitism.Madeleine Hurd, Public Spheres, Public Mores, and Democracy: Hamburg and Stockholm, 1870-1914, University of Michigan Press, 2000, p. 75 Rhetoric condemning capitalism and the upper classes was also a regular feature of the party's appeal.Hurd, Public Spheres, Public Mores, and Democracy, pp. 178-179 Its 1895 programme called for the reorganisation of the labour force on a national basis as well as an extensive reformation of the legal system aimed at \\"displacing the capitalist excesses of the present laws\\".Peter G. J. Pulzer, The Rise of Political Anti-semitism in Germany & Austria, Harvard University Press, 1988, p. 44 In 1895 they added a call for compulsory guild membership for all craftsmen to their party programme.Strauss, Hostages of Modernization, p. 76 Decline Due to its nature as a merger between an essentially conservative party and a radical one the DNSP was riven by splits and personality conflicts throughout its existence.Levy, Antisemitism, pp. 22-23 Liebermann von Sonnenberg clashed in particular with Zimmermann, with both men commanding factions within the party. As a united party the DSRP contested only the 1898 federal election and, although they gained thirteen seats in the Reichstag, this was a drop of three from the total antisemitic seats at the previous election.Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p. 762 Their appeals to working class voters were unsuccessful but they also failed to win significant support from the middle classes, resulting in a decreased vote share.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism 1914-45, Routledge, 2001, p. 57 The party also struggled to get the access to publicity enjoyed by the more mainstream forces of the right, some of whom had come to co-opt elements of antisemitism into their own programmes, thus denting the DSRP's chances.Strauss, Hostages of Modernization, p. 147 The party split entirely in 1900 with the DSP re-established. The reconstituted party was able to maintain its presence in the Reichstag until the fall of the empire.Rudy J. Koshar, Social Life, Local Politics, and Nazism: Marburg, 1880-1935, UNC Press Books, 2014, p. 71 The remnants of the group would subsequently be absorbed into the German National People's Party in 1918.Larry Eugene Jones, The German Right in the Weimar Republic: Studies in the History of German Conservatism, Nationalism, and Antisemitism, Berghahn Books, 2014, p. 80 Zimmermann would also revive the DRP name and it too continued to be represented in the Reichstag until the end of the empire.Walther Killy (ed.), Dictionary of German Biography: Thibaut - Zycha, Volume 10, Walter de Gruyter, 2006, p. 705 References Category:Political parties established in 1894 Category:Political parties disestablished in 1900 Category:Political parties of the German Empire Category:Defunct political parties in Germany Category:Protestant political parties Category:Antisemitism in Germany ","title":"German Social Reform Party"},{"id":"49255336","text":"Zengcheng Stadium (), or Zengcheng Kangwei Stadium () is a multi-purpose stadium in Zengcheng District, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.

Plastics can be processed with the following methods: machining, compression molding, transfer molding, injection molding, extrusion, rotational molding, blow molding, thermoforming, casting, forging, and foam molding. Processing methods are selected based on equipment cost, production rate, tooling cost, and build volume. High equipment and tooling cost methods are typically used for large production volumes whereas low - medium equipment cost and tooling cost methods are used for low production volumes. Compression molding, transfer molding, injection molding, forging, and foam molding have high equipment and tooling cost. Lower cost processes are machining, extruding, rotational molding, blow molding, thermoforming, and casting. A summary of each process and its cost is displayed in figure 1. Aspects of plastic processing= Degradable plastics = Oxo-degradable plastics: these are petroleum-based plastics with additives such as transition metals and metals salts that promote the process of fragmentation of the plastic when exposed to a particular environment, such as high temperature or oxygen rich one, for a prolonged period of time. Fragmentation exposes a larger surface area of the plastic to colonies of bacteria that eventually decompose the polymer into its lower energy state components: carbon dioxide and water. Some aspects to take into account regarding this method to dispose of end-of-life plastics are: * The type of polymer: experiments conducted by Chiellini et al. confirmed that bacteria are only able to decompose low molecular weight polymers (at least at a rate that can be appreciated). * Environmental conditions: the time for fragmentation/degradation varies according to conditions which aren‚Äôt always controllable. * Material‚Äôs potential to be recycled: this characteristic will be compromised, since the polymer‚Äôs durability or strength will be affected by the additives that accelerate fragmentation. Classifying a polymer as bio- degradable requires specifications regarding these aspects. Important economic aspects that need to be considered when disposing of degradable polymers include: * Waste landfill costs: if plastics represent a significant percentage of waste in a particular region, manufacturing plastics with bio- degradable properties may be more profitable and ecologically friendly than merely disposing of a non-degradable plastic. By using degradable polymers, costs due to waste transportation, landfill maintenance, new landfill excavation and environmental hazard control can be avoided. * Lost end-of-life plastic potential: processes such as energy recovery of the plastic by incineration or biological treatment and material recovery by recycling have to be taken into account when assessing the feasibility of manufacturing degradable polymers. = Reusable plastic containers = The implementation of reusable plastic containers arises as a consequence of concerns with sustainability and environmental impact. Use of recyclable plastic packages is beneficial environmentally but is more expensive. The adoption of reusable plastic containers will amount to an approximate annual increase of 0.058 euros/kg of delivered goods. The cost associated with reusable plastic containers are packaging purchasing costs, transportation costs, labor/handling costs, management costs, and costs resulting from losses. Packaging purchasing costs encompasses the cost of the containers as well as any associated service costs. This cost is reoccurring but is only relevant once every 50 cycles, which is the typical lifetime of reusable plastic containers. One cycle consists of the initial stages of processing plastic containers all the way to the use and recycling of these containers by the consumers. Transportation costs are slightly higher for reusable plastic containers as compared to traditional use and throwaway plastic containers in that these reusable containers need additional transportation to recycling facilities. Reusable plastic containers also require work loading and unloading from trucks as well as quality inspection, this adds additional labor costs. Management costs exists because reusable plastic container stock count needs to be managed. The final cost of reusable plastic containers is the cost incurred when packages are lost or there are errors within the management system. Figure 2 provides a detailed summary of the costs associated with adopting reusable plastic containers. =Incineration of plastics= Recycling plastics presents the difficulty of handling mixed plastics, as unmixed plastics are usually necessary to maintain desirable properties. Mixing many plastics results in diminished material properties, with even just a few percent of polypropylene mixed with polyethylene producing a plastic with significantly reduced tensile strength. An alternative to recycling of these plastics and those which can‚Äôt be easily recycled such as thermosets is to use degradation to break the polymers down into monomers of low molecular weight. The products of this process can be used to make high quality polymers however energy stored in the polymer bonds is lost during this process. An alternative to economically dispose of plastics is to burn them in an incinerator. Incinerators capable of cleanly burning polymers exist and while they require significant capital investment, the energy produced offsets the economic impact. Since most plastics are produced from petroleum, their molecules consist exclusively or primarily of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms. With proper design, an incinerator can completely combust these plastics allowing the recovery of energy stored in the original petroleum feedstock which would otherwise escape during processes such as degradation. Some polymers contain chlorine or nitrogen which can result in undesirable combustion products however the use of scrubbers can remove such products. The end result is that many polymers burn more cleanly than coal and as clean as most oils.

This gene encodes a GTP-specific beta subunit of succinyl-CoA synthetase. Succinyl-CoA synthetase catalyzes the reversible reaction involving the formation of succinyl-CoA and succinate. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Pseudogenes of this gene are found on chromosomes 5 and 12. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2010]  Structure  SCS, also known as succinyl CoA ligase (SUCL), is a heterodimer composed of a catalytic Œ± subunit encoded by the SUCLG1 gene and a Œ≤ subunit encoded by either the SUCLA2 gene or the SUCLG2 gene, which determines the enzyme specificity for either ADP or GDP. SUCLG2 is the SCS variant containing the SUCLG2-encoded Œ≤ subunit. Amino acid sequence alignment of the two Œ≤ subunit types reveals a homology of ~50% identity, with specific regions conserved throughout the sequences. SUCLG2 is located on chromosome 3 and contains 14 exons.  Function  As a subunit of SCS, SUCLG2 is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate and acetoacetyl CoA, accompanied by the substrate-level phosphorylation of GDP to GTP, as a step in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The GTP generated is then consumed in anabolic pathways. However, since GTP is not transported through the inner mitochondrial membrane in mammals and other higher organisms, it must be recycled within the matrix. In addition, SUCLG2 may function in ATP generation in the absence of SUCLA2 by complexing with the mitochondrial nucleotide diphosphate kinase, nm23-H4, and thus compensate for SUCLA2 deficiency. The reverse reaction generates succinyl-CoA from succinate to fuel ketone body and heme synthesis. While SCS is ubiquitously expressed, SUCLG2 is predominantly expressed in tissues involved in biosynthesis, including liver and kidney. SUCLG2 has also been detected in the microvasculature of the brain, likely to support its growth. Notably, both SUCLA2 and SUCLG2 are absent in astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in the brain; thus, in order to acquire succinate to continue the TCA cycle, these cells may instead synthesize succinate through GABA metabolism of Œ±-ketoglutarate or ketone body metabolism of succinyl-CoA.  Clinical significance  Though mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome has been largely attributed to SUCLA2 deficiency, SUCLG2 may play a more crucial role in mtDNA maintenance, as it functions to compensate for SUCLA2 deficiency and its absence results in decreased mtDNA and OXPHOS-dependent growth. Moreover, no mutations in the SUCLG2 gene have been reported, indicating that such mutations are lethal and selected against. SUCLG2 may also play a role in clearing cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta 1‚Äì42 (AŒ≤1‚Äì42) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and, thus, reducing neuronal death.

It is known as a \\"rich man's fruit\\" as it is marketed at a higher price compared to other varieties of banana due to greater inputs in farming with fertilizer (compost, in particular in large quantity), water, and workforce. While its skin is red coloured, the pulp is creamish in colour with an enjoyable taste. It has a high calorie value with Vitamin C and B6, which makes it a health food. The horticultural product is protected under the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act (GI Act) 1999 of the Government of India. It was registered by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks under the title \\"Kamalapur Red Banana\\" and recorded at GI Application number 133 under Class 31 as a horticulture item. In view of its GI identity, genetic engineering tests are not allowed to be done on this variety of banana, and it is exclusively the property of Kamalapur farming community. Geography The villages where this fruit is grown are in Kamalapur and surrounding areas such as in Rajanal and Navanihal villages and covers a total area of about . It is grown only on hill slopes in the valley surrounded by hills on three sides which gives the crop protection from damage due to storms as the tree stem is very tall. This variety can not be grown in plain land. The plant grows in natural rainfall conditions in hot and humid weather. If grown in low lands furrow irrigation or drip irrigation is practiced. The soil type where it is grown consists of red loamy soil which is a gradual transformation from black soil conditions. Locally, the soil is known as \\"halubilapu\\" meaning \\"clay soil\\" to denote white clay-loam formation which is of shallow depth and drains freely. The soil is calcareous to some extent with organic carbon and has a low degree of alkalinity. The rainfall incidence is of the order of for the district. Characteristics The plant, with its \\"stem stout\\", grows to a height of with a base of about in circumference and grows with shades of green and yellow colours. Its leaves, oblong in shape, of greenish yellow colour, are long and brittle. The plant's flowers and fruits get set in about 10 to 11 months time followed by a maturity period of about 7‚Äì8 months and then harvested in about 18 months. Each tree yields 15 to 20 kg, averaging 11 tons per acre, and is generally free from pests. The skin or the rind of the fruit is in moderate red colour while its pulp is in cream colour, and is of likeable taste. The planting is done in pits of square dug to depth and filled with a thin layer of ash followed by compost, neem leaves, topsoil and organic manure. Planting is done thereafter in about 2 weeks time. The planting is done at a spacing of 7 ft in either direction. In a recent innovation, following the planting practice in Israel, adopted in India by the National Council of Research in Banana (NCRB), the spacing of plants has been modified into a triangular pattern which can now accommodate 1,710 plants instead of earlier 1,210 plants per acre which is said to have increased the yield by about 20 tons per acre. Planting is done during August/September, and before planting, the suckers are dipped in cow dung water overnight to prevent any diseases to the plant. Desuckering operation is carried out at an interval of 45 days and the total time taken from planting to harvesting is about 18 months. There are no \\"pre or post harvest techniques\\" for its preservation. However, the bunches are kept in airtight chambers with incense burning to facilitate the fruit to ripen early. Chemical properties The nutritional status of the fruits has been tested at the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), which indicates that the fruit has a composition of calcium, iron, potassium and fibre which is much superior to that of other banana types. Its calorie content is high with Vitamin C and B6. The Total Soluble Solids (TSS) is reported to be 20-22 degrees Brix. The agency which regulates the quality standards is the Department of Forestry and Environmental Science of the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore. Incentives The Horticulture department is encouraging farmers to extend their area of cultivation under this fruit crop by providing certified seeds at subsidized rates along with other incentives.

(9 May 1851 ‚Äì 1 January 1913) was a Spanish prelate of the Roman Catholic Church and a member of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin. He arrived as Guam's first bishop in 1911, and serving as apostolic vicar for less than a year, dying on 1 January 1913.  Biography  Bishop Vil√° y Mateu in 1911 or 1912 with other Capuchins. Bishop Vil√° y Mateu in 1911 or 1912 with other Capuchins and some Guam natives. Ricardo Vil√° y Mateu was born on 9 May 1851 in the small town of Arenys de Mar, Province of Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain. In his late teens, he decided to become a Capuchin Franciscan friar, but the turbulent political situation caused him to pursue his vocation elsewhere. He moved to Guatemala in 1869 and joined the order there, taking the name of Francisco Javier, in honor of St. Francis Xavier, the famous Spanish missionary. He studied theology in Toulouse, France, and was ordained a priest on 24 August 1875 in Ecuador. Vil√°'s first leadership position was as Novice Master in Spain. He later served as Provincial Definitor and Provincial Minister (superior) of the Capuchin Aragon Province from 1889‚Äì1895, and the Catalonia Province from 1900‚Äì1906. On 25 August 1911, Pope Pius X appointed Vil√° the first Apostolic Vicar of the Apostolic Vicariate of Aga√±a in Guam. He was also appointed to the position of Titular Bishop of Adraa. His consecration to the episcopacy took place on 1 October 1911, with Bishop Juan Jos√© Laguarda y Fenollera, Bishop of Barcelona, as the Principal Consecrator. Principal Co-Consecrators were Bishop Francisco de Pol y Baralt, Bishop of Gerona, and Bishop Luis Jos√© Amig√≥ y Ferrer, O.F.M.Cap., Titular Bishop of Thagaste. Prior to Vil√°'s appointment, the highest church official in Guam had been one of the priests running the island's mission, usually a Jesuit, Augustinian Recollect, or diocesan priest from the Archdiocese of Cebu in the Philippines. In the years directly preceding his episcopate, German Capuchins had been tasked to take over the mission, and were set to arrive in 1911. However, when social and political opposition prevented them from doing so, the Holy See assigned Spanish Capuchins instead. It was also decided that the growth of Catholicism in Guam warranted formal leadership and hence Vil√°'s appointment as the first Vicar General. Vil√°'s term was cut short by his sudden death on 1 January 1913 in Hag√•t√±a, the village that held the cathedral. He was buried the next day, making him the first Catholic bishop interred on Guam.

Film history Fante-Anne is considered to mark the beginning of the national breakthrough in the Norwegian film culture. This was the first Norwegian film to feature professional actors. Unlike previous films made in Norway, Fante-Anne was also made with professionals working at all levels behind the camera. It is also noteworthy as one of the few Norwegian films from this period with Norwegians participating at all levels because Norwegian films were often created by Swedes, Danes, and Germans. Fante-Anne is therefore regarded as the first professional Norwegian feature film. The film makes use of the Norwegian landscape and rural lifestyle where the action takes place. The film was the first for which the distributor Kommunenes Filmcentral and Norwegian cinema owners were involved in the production. Fante-Anne was also the start of the over three-decade career of Rasmus Breistein, one of the most prominent Norwegian directors of the 20th century. The film was restored and reissued in 2011, with new music written by Halldor Krogh. Originally, the director Rasmus Breistein himself played the fiddle during screenings of the film. Plot Anne, an orphan girl, is raised by the Storlein family on a large farm. After the family's son breaks his promise to live with her and marries another, jealousy causes her to set fire to the farmhouse. Another young man, Jon, is in love with her; he takes the blame for the fire and serves several years of hard labor at Akershus Fortress. After he is released Anne meets him on the road and he persuades Anne and his mother to travel to America together to begin a new life.IMDb: Gipsy Anne (1920) Plot Summary.

The lighthouse lost its top structure during World War II and was repaired afterwards to become a lower black lighthouse in 1947. However, the lighthouse became inactive in 1951 as part of military strategy due to the tension with People's Liberation Army. In 1960-1975, works were made to improve the lighthouse, such as concreting the wall, increasing its height, adding house inside the wall and creating a connecting tunnel. In 2001, the lighthouse was officially closed after it was placed under the jurisdiction of the Republic of China Armed Forces. On 23 July 2017, the Maritime and Port Bureau signed an agreement with the armed forces to take over the lighthouse.

Hoit (4 August 1872 ‚Äì 30 May 1951) was a well known Kansas City, Missouri architect in the early 20th century. He and his partners designed many of Kansas City's most iconic commercial and residential buildings including the Kansas City Power and Light Building and the R.A. Long residence (Kansas City Museum at Corinthian Hall).  Professional life  Henry Ford Hoit was born in Chicago, Illinois on August 4, 1872. He graduated from the Chicago Manual Training School in 1892. Hoit went on to complete a special course in architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, graduating in 1898. While there, he became a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. In 1887 he was presented an award from the Boston Society of Architects for the best work in the field. Hoit worked for various firms in Boston until 1901 when he received a letter from a fraternity brother, William H. Cutler. Cutler was a draftsman at the Kansas City firm of Van Brunt & Howe. The letter stated: Hoit accepted and went to Kansas City to make his fortune. Henry F. Hoit seated behind his desk while contemplating a map of Kansas City, July 23, 1913. The picture hanging behind him is of the Palace of Varied Industries at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (1904 St. Louis World's Fair). Hoit designed the building while employed at the firm of Van Brunt & Howe. Folder 6; Alfred Edward Barnes (1892‚Äì1960) Architectural Records (K0004); The State Historical Society of Missouri Research Center-Kansas City. The building that Hoit was asked to design was the Palace of Varied Industries at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (1904 St. Louis World's Fair). The building covered about 14.5 acres of the exposition which took place on what is now Forest Park and Washington University in St. Louis. By the time the fair opened, Henry Van Brunt had retired and returned to Massachusetts. He died in 1903. Frank M. Howe took on Hoit and Cutler as partners, forming Howe, Hoit & Cutler. Cutler died in 1907 and Howe died in 1909. The firm operated under Hoit's name until he partnered with Edwin M. Price and Alfred E. Barnes to establish Hoit, Price and Barnes on January 1, 1919. Apparently his work made quite an impression on lumber magnate Robert A. Long of the Long-Bell Lumber Company. Long hired Howe, Hoit & Cutler to design the Independence Boulevard Christian Church that opened in 1905 and the R.A. Long Building which opened in 1907. Hoit went on to design Long's personal residence, Corinthian Hall which is now the Kansas City Museum. He also designed Longview Farm. These opened in 1908 and 1914. Long wasn't the only tycoon impressed with Hoit. He designed both commercial buildings and personal residences for many wealthy Kansas Citians including Mack. B. Nelson, J. W. Perry, C. C. Peters, C. A. Braley, and Robert Keith. He also designed the Cosden Building (Mid-Continent Tower) in Tulsa, Oklahoma as well as residences for Tulsa oil barons J. S. Cosden and J. H. Markham. While Hoit had been designing skyscrapers since he did the 16 story R.A. Long Building in 1907, he really \\"made it big\\" when his firm designed the original 14 stories of the Southwestern Bell Telephone Building (Oak Tower). That's because Hoit, Price & Barnes (HPB) also designed the additional 14 stories in 1929, making the 28-story building the tallest in Kansas City. Meanwhile, HPB designed the Kansas City Athletic Club Building (22 stories) in 1923, and floors 8-15 of the Dierks Building in 1926. Then in 1931, HPB not only designed the 32-story Fidelity National Bank Building but they also designed the 34-story Kansas City Power and Light Building. That was the tallest building in the state of Missouri until 1976. Hoit, Price and Barnes also designed the mechanical systems for Municipal Auditorium, a project that took several years to complete, opening in 1935. The firm continued on a variety of projects until Hoit retired and the firm was dissolved in 1941. Hoit was also known for his community involvement. In 1907, he was a member of the board to review Kansas City building laws. He was a member of the board of appeals from 1908-1910. He was also a member of the board of the Thomas H. Swope settlement in 1910. In 1938, Hoit became a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects (FAIA), an honor that recognized his professional leadership and accomplishments. There are many buildings on the National Register of Historic Places that were designed by Hoit and his partners. These include the Baker-Vawter Building, the Charles A. Braley House, Christian Church Hospital, the Continental Hotel, the Cosden Building, the O.H. Dean Building, the Fidelity National Bank & Trust Building, Independence Boulevard Christian Church, the Kansas City Power and Light Building, the R.A. Long Building and the R.A. Long Residence.Nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com - Retrieved January 15, 2016  Personal life  Hoit was the son of Chicago merchant Jeremiah Parsons and Elizabeth (Starrett) Hoit. His family descended from John Hoyt, an English settler of Salisbury, Massachusetts. Hoit's father changed the spelling of their last name. While still in Boston, Hoit met Florence Eleanor Stinchfield, a mezzo-soprano who was studying music in Boston. She also studied under Luigi Vannuccini in Florence, Italy and in London as well. She was born on August 24, 1873 in Lewiston, Maine. Her parents were Oliver Dorrance and Lizzie R. (Symonds) Stinchfield. Oliver D. Stinchfield was a piano tuner as well as a self-described \\"musician, writer, artist, photographer, and humorist entertainer.\\" They were married on Christmas Day of 1900. Shortly after arriving in Kansas City, the Hoit's had their only child, Imogene Elizabeth, born April 16, 1902. With the success that he was achieving as a partner at Howe, Hoit & Cutler, Hoit decided to build a home in the Valentine Neighborhood of Kansas City. Contrary to the huge neoclassical mansions that Hoit was to design, his house was a 3,000-square-foot craftsman style home at 3771 Washington Street. It has brick on the first level and cedar shingle siding on the upper levels. The Hoits lived next door at 3765 Washington for a short time while their new home was being built. It was completed in 1907. The Hoits moved to the Country Club District in 1930 to a 6-year-old house at 838 W. 58th Street. Imogene attended Dana Hall School in Wellesley, Massachusetts and she studied voice at the University of Kansas. She was married to Stuart A. Campbell on March 5, 1927. They had two children, Stuart Hoit Campbell (July 7, 1929 - November 7, 2011) and Alice Jeanne (Campbell) Swicegood (May 23, 1934 - March 15, 2001). She remarried later in life to Jerry Watson Ramsey. Henry F. Hoit died on May 30, 1951 at the age of 78. Florence S. Hoit died on May 10, 1967, at age 93.

The white, wooden church was built in a long church design in 1867 using designs by the architect Hans Linstow. The church seats about 200 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1300, but it was likely built some time before that. The first church was probably a stave church, located immediately to the west of the present building. In the year 1300, the priest of Fister was involved in a conflict between the Bishop of Stavanger and his canon. The priest of Fister, along with 3 other nearby priests were fined for illegally banning a number of Hird men from the church. In 1867, a new church was constructed immediately to the east of the old church. After the new church was completed, the old church was torn down and its materials were sold at auction.

He was one of the early contributors to Albanian music and opera who spent all his life in their service; one of the symbols of the cultural traditions of his hometown of Kor√ß√´, same as other musicians as Tefta Tashko-Ko√ßo, Jorgjia Truja, and Kristaq Antoniu; and one of the main personalities of the early generation of Albanian composers together with Nikolla Zoraqi, Tish Daija, Tonin Harapi, and Feim Ibrahimi. Early life and work Kono was born on 22 January 1907 in Kor√ß√´, back then still part of the Ottoman Empire, today's southeastern Albania. His interest in music showed up at a very early age. He followed the \\"Vatra\\" orchestral band in order to learn how to play the clarinet. In the 1920s he would start to compose songs and small instrumental parts. In 1927, he went to Paris to study music at the Conservatoire de Paris but stayed there only 15 months. He moved to Milan and enrolled in the Giuseppe Verdi conservatoire. Finishing his studies in 1932, he returned home. In September of the same year, Kono participated in a concert of the cultural society \\"Skanderbeg\\" of Kor√ß√´, where he showed his skills for the first time before the Albanian public. The first post-study years he worked as a music teacher in the city of Gjirokaster and in the National Lyceum of his hometown, one of the most accredited schools of that time within Albania. At both schools he set up choirs and orchestras and performed for the public. At the same time, he began working with renowned artistic choir \\"Lira\\" (The lyre). After creating romances like Asnj√´ shpres√´ (\\"No hope\\"), Vjollcat (The violets), and Ktheju (\\"Come back\\") based on Hil√´ Mosi's lyrics, he composed some well known urban lyrical songs which were sung by singers such as Truja and Tashko-Ko√ßo. The most known were Kur m√´ vjen burrin nga stani (\\"When my husband comes back from dairy\\"), and Kur m'u rrite vog√´loshe (\\"You have grown up little girl\\") based on lyrics from Poradeci, and Fol e qesh moj sylarushe (Talk and laugh o you bright eyed girl\\") based on the lyrics of Milto Sotir Gurra. A less known side of his work was as a folklorist; he engaged in collecting and processing for the chorus many folkloric songs, giving them new quality and value. This work was converged in the publication of two choral rhapsodies. The \\"Albanian Rhapsody No. 1\\" was based on southern-Albania folk motives and performed with great success in Tirana on 28 November 1942, the Albanian Flag Day. Rise as a composer After World War II, Kono's artistic creativity intensified. He went deeper in the study of folk songs and patriotic songs. His big jump in fame came with the composition of major choral and instrumental works: instrumental poems and cantata. They were the first of their kind in Albania. The best known were the instrumental poems Borova (Borova) and Lab√´ria (Lab√´ria), and the cantata Malli p√´r atdhe (\\"Longing for the homeland\\"). His most known concert- instrumental works consist of Fantazi shqiptare (\\"Albanian fantasy\\"), Valle shqiptare (\\"Albanian dance\\"), the fantasia Mezhgorani (Mezhgoran), and the poem for orchestra Bredhat e Drenov√´s (\\"Drenova fir\\"). Kono wrote many instrumental pieces of different formations, from suites for orchestra, ensemble pieces for flute, oboe, violin, piano, clarinet, etc. His operetta Agimi (The dawn) of 1954 paved the way for the development of opera in Albania. After that, he composed two other operettas, S√´ bashku jeta √´sht√´ e bukur (\\"Together life is beautiful\\") in 1957, and Brigadierja (\\" The brigadier\\") in 1968. The opera Lulja e kujtimit (\\"Flower of remembrance\\") based on Foqion Postoli's work with the same title, which was performed the first time in November 1961, is considered his masterpiece. It was performed several times by the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet. Kono died in 1991 in Kor√ß√´.

Ratnakƒ´rti studied at Vikramashila university under J√±anasrimitra (975‚Äì1025).McDermott, A. C. Senape; An Eleventh-Century Buddhist Logic of ‚ÄòExists‚Äô Ratnakƒ´rti's 'Refutation of Other mindstreams' (Sa·πÉt√£n√£ntaradusana), argued that knowledge of external streams of consciousness (citta-santƒÅna) is a form of inference (anumƒÅna), not a direct perception (pratyak·π£a). Ratnakƒ´rti introduced the two truths doctrine as key to the nature of the discussion. Since inference deals with conceptual universals, the proof of the mindstreams of others, whilst empirically valid in relative truth (sa·πÉv·πõtisatya), does not hold ultimate metaphysical certainty in absolute truth (paramƒÅrthasatya). Ratnakƒ´rti therefore argued for the ultimate truth of \\"one mind\\" (ekacitta). By establishing the impossibility of external mindstreams, Ratnakƒ´rti was also arguing for the non-dualism of Yogacara \\"consciousness-only\\".Chakrabarti, Arindam; Weber, Ralph; Comparative Philosophy without Borders. New York: Bloomsbury Academic, 2015. pp 103‚Äì104. Ratnakƒ´rti argued that from an ultimate point of view, the distinctions between a subject and object, the observer and the observed, all disappear. Ratnakƒ´rti's theory states then, that there is no logical foundation for individuating mindstreams, and that there are no boundaries between minds from the perspective of ultimate truth.Jonardon Ganeri, The Concealed Art of the Soul, Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2007 This sub school of Yogacara Cittamatra (mind only) has been called the Citradvaitavada school (non-dual mind) or Vij√±anadvaitavada school (non-dual consciousness).Wood, Thomas E.

New York: Columbia University Press, 2009. . Ratnakƒ´rti also wrote the \\"Proof of Momentariness\\" (K·π£ƒÅnabha·πÖgasiddhi), where he defended the theory of momentariness, the view that dharmas last only for a moment.

It is an erect, densely foliaged shrub with branches and leaves sticky and shiny due to the presence of resin. It has hairy sepals and lilac-coloured flowers. Description Eremophila glutinosa is an erect shrub growing to a height of between with branches that are densely covered with glandular hairs that are often obscured by a thick layer of resin. The leaves are mostly long, wide, densely clustered near the ends of the branches, linear in shape, channelled on the lower surface and covered with resin. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a sticky, hairy stalk, usually long. There are 5 overlapping, green, lance-shaped to egg-shaped sepals which are mostly long and hairy on both the inner and outer surfaces. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The tube is a shade of lilac with dark spots inside the tube and on part of the lobes. The outside of the tube is sparsely hairy, the inside of the lobes glabrous and the inside of the tube is densely woolly. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the tube. Flowering occurs from June to October and is followed by fruits which are dry, woody, hairy and long.Mount Augustus Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 1979 and the description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The specific epithet (glutinosa) is a Latin word meaning \\"sticky\\" or \\"viscous\\", referring to the sticky leaves of this species. Distribution and habitat Eremophila glutinosa usually grows on rocky hills, on granite outcrops or along temporary watercourses in clay or sandy soils between Laverton and Mount Augustus in the Avon Wheatbelt, Gascoyne, Murchison and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. Conservation status Sticky emu bush is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This eremophila is not well known in cultivation and has generally only been grown by propagating onto Myoporum rootstock. It grows in full sun or partial shade but needs protection from frosts.

Ignite the Dream unfolds on the park's castle, Enchanted Storybook Castle, similar to other hybrid-nighttime castle shows found at other Disney parks, including: Disney Illuminations at Disneyland Paris for the 25th Anniversary edition. The show features fireworks, water fountains, fire, lasers, projection mapping, and searchlights. The show‚Äôs story is centered on Mickey Mouse flying through the evening sky after discovering a magical spark that ignites his imagination.  Show summary  Mickey Mouse unleashes a spark of imagination allows him to journey across several Disney films. Mickey is transported to three scenes from The Lion King. Mickey splashes down a waterfall that transports him underwater and into the sea, where he encounters Ariel from The Little Mermaid. The scenery transitions into the Great Barrier Reef from Finding Nemo, where Mickey is swept up into the waves of the East Australian Current. The waves lead him to a sunken pirate ship, where Mickey opens a treasure chest and uncovers a cursed Aztec coin. The disembodied voice from Pirates of the Caribbean is heard and a battle siege led by Jack Sparrow unfolds. Mickey is then taken to the Cave of Wonders from Aladdin, where he upons the Genie, who performs \\"Friend Like Me\\". The sequence is followed by a montage of Mulan. The balloons from Up appear across the castle, carrying Mickey high above into the stars as the Millennium Falcon flies across the castle and enters a frenetic space battle from Star Wars. Following that, the show depicts a climactic scene from Frozen with Elsa and Anna. The show then concludes with a finale featuring a montage of scenes from the previously represented Disney films as well as Beauty and the Beast, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Princess and the Frog, Cars, Toy Story, Zootopia, Monsters Inc., Tangled, and Big Hero 6. = Soundtrack = * \\"A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes\\" (from Cinderella) (Mack David / Al Hoffman / Jerry Livingston) * \\"Circle of Life\\", \\"I Just Can't Wait to be King\\", \\"Hakuna Matata\\" (from The Lion King) (Elton John / Tim Rice) * \\"Part of Your World\\" (from The Little Mermaid) (Alan Menken / Howard Ashman) * \\"Carried Me with You\\" (from Onward) (Brandi Carlile) * \\"He's a Pirate\\" (from Pirates of the Caribbean) (Klaus Badelt) * \\"Friend Like Me\\" (from Aladdin) (Menken / Ashman) * \\"Reflection\\", \\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\\" (from Mulan) (Matthew Wilder / David Zippel) * \\"When You Wish upon a Star\\" (from Pinocchio) (Leigh Harline / Ned Washington) * \\"Main Title\\", \\"March of the Resistance\\" (from Star Wars / Star Wars: The Force Awakens) (John Williams) * \\"Let it Go\\", \\"For the First Time in Forever\\" (from Frozen) (Robert Lopez / Kristen-Anderson Lopez) * \\"Transformation\\" (from Beauty and the Beast) (Alan Menken) * \\"Mickey Mouse March\\" (from The Mickey Mouse Club) (Jimmie Dodd)  See also  * Disney Dreams! * Disney Illuminations * Happily Ever After * Once Upon a Time * Disneyland Forever * Remember...

History The groundbreaking ceremony for its construction occurred on May 11, 1990. With both city and business leaders in attendance, a balloon released to a height of was also on display to give onlookers better context as to the finished height of the structure. By October construction had already brought the tower to its seventh floor. On October 29, a construction worker fell to his death from the seventh floor. This was the only fatality associated with the construction of the tower. The final concrete was poured for the tower in April 1991 and the first tenant moved in by October 1991. Profile Designed by the firm of Clark Tribble Harris & Li Architects, the tower is of a postmodern design and is the tallest building in both Roanoke and all of Southwest Virginia. It is topped with a copper pyramid with a spire atop it, and was designed as a homage to the Hotel Roanoke, located to the north of the tower. At night, the tower is illuminated by 135 floodlights. Although the tower officially has its floor count at 21 stories, there is not a numbered 13th floor to quell the fear of persons that may have triskaidekaphobia. Naming After the purchase of Wachovia by Wells Fargo in late 2008, the name of the tower was set to change for the third time. In July 2011, the tower was officially renamed as the Wells Fargo Tower to reflect the official rebranding of Wachovia to Wells Fargo in Virginia.

Early life and education and more Allen was born Tina Powell in Hempstead, New York in 1949 to father Gordon \\"Specs\\" Powell, a jazz drummer who played in the Ed Sullivan Show band, and Grenada-born Rosecleer Powell. Her mother was a writer and a nurse, and one of Allen‚Äôs uncles was a sculptor. Allen began painting at 5 years old; by the time she was 10 she was setting up her easel to paint the seascape of Grenada, West Indies where she lived until her early teens. Allen was an artistic child who began sculpting at the age of 13, when she was assigned to make an ashtray and instead created a bust of Aristotle. She was mentored by the Lithuanian-American sculptor William Zorach who declared her a prodigy. She earned a bachelor of fine arts degree from the University of South Alabama in 1978. She also studied at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan and received her Masters at the Pratt Institute. People described her art as a history in bronze because she always focused on important black historical figures and wanted to portray them through sculpture. Allen often focused on the Harlem Renaissance. She also had periods of her work focus specifically on black men and then she turned her interest to black women. After college she volunteered for AmeriCorps VISTA and for several years hosted a local television show on the arts in Mobile, Alabama. Career Allen's first major work was a nine-foot bronze statue of A. Philip Randolph, leader of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. Commissioned in 1986, the piece is displayed in Boston's Back Bay commuter train station and is featured on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail. Over the next two decades Allen continued creating realistic sculptures of black activists for display in public spaces. Her work is also collected by museums, corporations and private collectors. Explaining her motivation, she said in an interview, \\"My work is not about me, it's about us.\\" Not only does her work serve to emphasize the contributions and aspirations of the African Diaspora but also works to create a \\"visual landscape that is nurturing and life affirming to people of color\\" in celebrating the beauty of African Americans. One of her best known works is a 13-foot bronze likeness of Alex Haley, which was installed in the Haley Heritage Square Park in Knoxville, Tennessee in 1998. Her statue of George Washington Carver is the focal point of the George Washington Carver Garden at the Missouri Botanical Gardens in St. Louis. Her 12-foot bronze monument to Sojourner Truth is displayed in Memorial Park Battle Creek, Michigan. Her bust of Frederick Douglass is on display at the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute; it was featured in a scene in the movie Akeelah and the Bee. She is part of the permanent collection at the Schomburg Center for Black Culture and the African-American museum in Long Island, New York. Allen also crafted a bronze medallion for the Women of Essence awards, which annually honor Black women of outstanding accomplishment and achievement. Other subjects include Ralph Bunche, Sammy Davis Jr., Charles R. Drew, Marcus Garvey, Martin Luther King, Jr., Betty Shabazz, Tupac Shakur, Nat ‚ÄúKing‚Äù Cole, James Baldwin, and Dorothy Dandridge. Personal life Allen was married twice and had three children, Koryan, Josephine, and Tara. She died of a heart attack due to complications of pneumonia in Los Angeles on September 9, 2008.

Inc., 346 U.S. 100 (1953), is a United States Supreme Court case which began on April 30, 1953 over the validity of the local Washington Acts of 1872 and 1873. The Acts prohibited segregation in public places within the District. With the court's support, the legal ramifications of the 1872 and 1873 Acts could once again be enforced. The case transpired during growing racial tension in the nation's capital. Throughout Washington, the black community had grown tired of unfair treatment regarding housing, businesses, and education. But, change came soon enough through the courts. On June 8, 1953, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the segregating policies practiced by Thompson's Cafeteria were illegal, marking a huge victory for the national black community..  Context  This challenge to segregation initially came from an African American activist, Mary Church Terrell. At 87, she was the chair of Washington's Coordinating Committee, which fought for desegregation across the city. Thanks to research by Howard University Law School Librarian Mercer Daniel,Chris Meyers Asch & Derek Musgrove, Chocolate City: Race and Democracy in the Nations Capital. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, forthcoming, ch. 9 p. 11. lawyers from the D.C. Lawyers Guild such as Charles Hamilton Houston, Joseph Forer, and David ReinChris Meyers Asch & Derek Musgrove, Chocolate City: Race and Democracy in the Nations Capital. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, forthcoming, ch. 9 p. 11 were able to notify Terrell that a number of laws from the Reconstruction Era that outlawed segregation, while not enforced, had technically never been repealed. Consequently, on January 27, 1950, Terrell and a small group of friends walked through the doors of Thompson's diner and requested a table. After the manager promptly refused to serve them, the Coordinating Committee thrust the issue of segregated eating establishments onto the legal and social stage of the nation's capital. Given its long list of civil rights all-stars including Walter E. Washington, William Hastie, Robert C. Weaver, and Annie Stein, the Coordinating Committee obtained media attention and put pressure on local officials. Normally when it was presented with segregated eating establishments, its actions included boycotts, protests, and silent negotiations. The group also amassed and distributed a wildly-popular list of preferred restaurants that served both blacks and whites as a means of putting economic pressure on more- reluctant restaurant owners. In this instance, the Committee decided to use Thompson's diner on 14th Street as the example to challenge in court. After the restaurant manager rejected Terrell and her friends, the Committee pressed the District Commissioners to look more closely at the restaurant for failing to comply with the Acts of 1872 and 1873.  Lower courts  Noticing that the Acts had clearly never been repealed, the City Commissioners immediately sided with Terrell. However, Thompson's manager was still unwilling to budge on his stance. Consequently, the District sued it on Terrell and the committee's behalf, and the case was brought to the local Municipal Court in July 1950. The Board of Trade, a notoriously-white elitist group that actively lobbied for Congress to uphold segregation, came to the legal aid of the restaurant. The Municipal Court quickly rejected the District's claim that the Reconstruction laws were still in effect stating that the laws \\"had been repealed by implication on the enactment by Congress of the Organic Act of June 11, 1878.\\"District of Columbia v. John R. Thompson Co. Supreme Court. 08 June 1953: 6. That Act restructured the local government to contain only three presidentially-appointed commissioners. Therefore, the Court argued that since the former laws had been put in place by an obsolete government, they no longer applied. A lengthy appeals process followed. In May 1951, Washington's Municipal Court of Appeals overturned the original ruling. In discussing the 1872 and 1873 laws, the Appeals Court stated that \\"the former Act insofar as it applied to restaurants, had been repealed, but the latter act was still in effect.\\" Therefore, the 1873 Act was still valid because there were no laws that automatically repealed measures put in place by former officials. However, the victory was short-lived because the verdict did not go into effect until all appeals had been heard.Chris Myers Asch with G. Derek Musgrove, Chocolate City: Race and Democracy in the Nation‚Äôs Capital. (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, forthcoming), ch. 9, p. 9.

Derek Musgrove, Chocolate City: Race and Democracy in the Nation‚Äôs Capital. (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, forthcoming), ch. 9, p. 10. Given the contradicting verdicts from various judges, the case soon found itself on the docket of the US Supreme Court. On April 30, 1953, the Supreme Court began its review of the case. Supreme Court decision The Supreme Court found flaws in the arguments put forth on Thompson's behalf. For one, the Court stated that \\"the failure of the executive branch to enforce a law does not result in its modification or repeal.\\"District of Columbia v. John R. Thompson Co. Supreme Court. 08 June 1953: 9. Essentially, although the city did not enforce the 1873 Act for roughly eight decades, it was still in effect. In addition, the Supreme Court reinforced that only Congress had \\"the power to pass laws which would alter or repeal the Acts of the Legislative Assembly.\\" The Court referenced how Congress, in the Organic Act of 1878, took away all legislative power from the local municipal government in Washington. Therefore, only Congress thereafter had the ability to repeal the 1873 Act, which protected the rights of all races in public places. Since Congress did not act on its power to appeal the Act, it was technically still in effect. Finally, the Supreme Court also touched on the controversy over the Code of 1901, which gave the local, Washington government more autonomy. The Court stated that \\"even if we assume that after the Code of 1901 the Commissioners had the authority to replace these anti-discrimination laws with others ones, we find no indication that they ever did so.\\"District of Columbia v. John R. Thompson Co. Supreme Court. 08 June 1953: 10. Consequently, on June 8, 1953, the Supreme Court overturned the decision of the Appeals Court and ruled in favor of the District of Columbia.  Aftermath  Terrell stated, \\"I will die happy to know that the children of my group will not grow up thinking they are inferior because they are deprived of rights which children of other racial groups enjoy.\\" At the age of 90, she was ecstatic to have not only the privilege but also the right at last to be served anywhere in the nation's capital. Along with Hurd v. Hodge and Bolling v. Sharpe, the case helped end institutionalized segregation in Washington. ReferencesBibliography *Caplan, Marvin. 1989. ‚ÄúEat Anywhere!‚Äù.

The Eco part of the enzyme's name originates from the species from which it was isolated, while the R represents the particular strain, in this case RY13. The last part of its name, the I, denotes that it was the first enzyme isolated from this strain. EcoRI is a restriction enzyme that cleaves DNA double helices into fragments at specific sites. It is also a part of the restriction modification system. In molecular biology it is used as a restriction enzyme. EcoRI creates 4 nucleotide sticky ends with 5' end overhangs of AATT. The nucleic acid recognition sequence where the enzyme cuts is G/AATTC, which has a palindromic, complementary sequence of CTTAA/G. The / in the sequence indicates which phosphodiester bond the enzyme will break in the DNA molecule. Other restriction enzymes, depending on their cut sites, can also leave 3' overhangs or blunt ends with no overhangs.  Structure = Primary structure = EcoRI contains the PD..D/EXK motif within its active site like many restriction endonucleases. = Tertiary and quaternary structure = The enzyme is a homodimer of a 31 kilodalton subunit consisting of one globular domain of the Œ±/Œ≤ architecture. Each subunit contains a loop which sticks out from the globular domain and wraps around the DNA when bound. EcoRI recognition site with cutting pattern indicated by a green line EcoRI has been cocrystallized with the sequence it normally cuts. This crystal was used to solve the structure of the complex . The solved crystal structure shows that the subunits of the enzyme homodimer interact with the DNA symmetrically. In the complex, two Œ±-helices from each subunit come together to form a four-helix bundle. On the interacting helices are residues Glu144 and Arg145, which interact together, forming a crosstalk ring that is believed to allow the enzyme's two active sites to communicate.  Uses  Restriction enzymes, such as EcoRI, are used in a wide variety of molecular genetics techniques including cloning, DNA screening and deleting sections of DNA in vitro. Restriction enzymes, like EcoRI, that generate sticky ends of DNA are often used to cut DNA prior to ligation, as the sticky ends make the ligation reaction more efficient. EcoRI can exhibit non-site-specific cutting, known as star activity, depending on the conditions present in the reaction. Conditions that can induce star activity when using EcoRI include low salt concentration, high glycerol concentration, excessive amounts of enzyme present in the reaction, high pH and contamination with certain organic solvents. The cut made by the Eco RI enzyme produces sticky ends on the vector mainly plasmids or viral DNA's.

It was built from 1915 to 1916. It is also known as Northern Regional Office, Department of Environment and Resource Management, Northern Regional Office, Environmental Protection Agency, and Cape Pallarenda Coastal Battery. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 April 1999. The building is part of Cape Pallarenda Conservation Park.  History  The former Quarantine Station at Cape Pallarenda was established between 1915-1916, using building materials previously used in the construction of an earlier quarantine station constructed in 1884-1885 at West Point, Magnetic Island. The concept of isolating those parts of the community suffering from disease dates to 14th century Italy, when Venice, trying to protect the city from ship-born disease, established a segregated area away from the centre of population. These isolation areas became known as quarantine stations, from the Latin words for forty days after which time patients, if they were not dead were considered clear of disease. Quarantine in the northern part of Australia began when the Moreton Bay District of New South Wales (later part of Queensland), established a quarantine station at Dunwich on Stradbroke Island in July 1849 after deaths were recorded on a ship arriving at Moreton Bay in January 1849. The introduction of disease into Northern Australia became an issue as the population of Australia increased after the discovery of gold in 1851, and in Queensland after the opening of a gold field at Crocodile Creek in Central Queensland in 1866. In 1867 the population expanded as a result of a rush of 15,000 diggers to new gold fields at Gympie, Central Queensland and Cape River, North Queensland. This growth of population and the development of Australia as a sea trading nation made it obvious that there was a need to control the introduction and spread of infectious diseases. The first Queensland Health Act was drafted in 1884; the other Australian colonies had drawn up laws by the late 1890s. In general, legislation established Central Boards of Health to enforce notification of infectious diseases and to provide guidelines for quarantining suspected cases. Townsville, the first or second port of call for shipping on the Asia/Pacific route, was identified as a place where suspected cases of ship-born disease could be detained. In 1875 Magnetic Island, just off Townsville, was set aside as a place of quarantine. Tents were set up at Picnic Bay, with passengers cared for by the Butler family, who had recently established pineapple plantations on the Island. The Butlers later built primitive huts at either end of the beach for male and female emigrants. A number of people died at Picnic Bay and are buried at the eastern end of the Bay. In 1884 a permanent quarantine station was established at West Point, Magnetic Island, in response to the provisions of the Queensland Health Act and as a result of community concern about the standard of accommodation for people quarantined on the island. Colonial Architect John James Clark prepared drawings for five buildings in 1883. Tenders were called on 9 October 1884 and the West Point site was gazetted as an area for quarantine in March 1885. Townsville builders, Lesser and Soarre, won the contract and work commenced in November 1884. By mid-1885 the hospital, single women's quarters, married quarters, single men's quarters, and a store had been constructed at a cost of . In early 1886 Townsville firm Cavell & Holt won the tender to construct a caretaker's cottage at a cost of . Between December 1885 and 1887 a jetty, Surgeon's Quarters, wash houses, and fencing were constructed by C & A Sparre at a cost of . In 1887, EJ Cavell built a luggage shed at a cost of . By 1909, when responsibility for the Quarantine Service had passed to the Commonwealth, the Port of Townsville had developed into the second busiest port in Queensland with special ferry facilities needed to transport quarantine cases to West Point. The West Point location had not proved to be an ideal one for a quarantine station. Lack of water, distance from the port, and distance from medical authorities caused difficulties. An increased interest in the study of tropical diseases after the establishment by the Commonwealth Health Department of the Tropical Institute Research Project in the General Hospital grounds in 1911, also led to a re-evaluation of the location of the quarantine station. A site was set aside at Cape Marlow (later Cape Pallarenda), for a mainland quarantine station in 1910, but it was not until 1914, with the threat of increased disease after the outbreak of World War 1, that planning began in earnest to move the West Point buildings to the mainland. Tenders, which were called in July 1914, were rejected as too high. Reviewing the proposal, the Director General of Works under the direction of the Minister for Home Affairs, decided the project should be carried out as an Employment Enhancement Scheme. The cost of the project, built by day labour, was set at and reassessed in 1917 at . The Cape Pallarenda site was cleared and a road cut across the town common to German Gardens (now known as Belgian Gardens). The Director of Quarantine approved the transfer of \\"buildings from Magnetic Island to the Cape Pallarenda site, some new buildings to be erected\\", in April 1913. Removal took 7 months from November 1915 to June 1916. The large buildings were unroofed, dismantled into wall and ceiling panels and the floors separated into scantlings. The materials were loaded onto a barge for transfer to the jetty at Cape Pallarenda. The buildings were re-erected according to drawings supplied by the Government architect for the Department of Home Affairs. On the new site the buildings received new roofs, had verandah handrails added, and the window details were changed. New buildings were constructed for the Administration Block (present Marine Parks Building), the Bath Block, the Asiatic Shelter Shed, the Laundry (Wet Tropics Volunteers Building), Incinerator Shed, and Disinfecting Block (present museum Building). The layout of the complex was detailed in a site drawing by CMU Todd, Works Director for Queensland, in 1916. Living facilities at the quarantine station were divided by the same class system that existed in ships. There were separate dining and living facilities for first and second class passengers and a segregated area near the fumigation shed for Asiatic seamen and passengers. The Asiatic area was a covered concrete slab where hammocks were suspended under a canopy. The complex was linked by a series of footpaths and a service road system. A well was sunk in the sand dunes above high water mark and a series of water mains were connected throughout. The beach front well was never entirely satisfactory and a small earthen weir was constructed in the creek behind the jetty. This weir never held water and in 1925 a second, small concrete dam was constructed on the slope of Many Peaks Range at the rear of the Station. This weir was constructed by A Jensen and cost . The quarantine station continued to accept quarantined passengers from ships travelling the Asian shipping routes well into the twentieth century. There was a good deal of activity, particularly during the flu epidemic of 1919 and the bubonic plague pandemic of the early part of the twentieth century. In August 1920, 13 Vietnamese sailors died of meningitis and were buried behind the hospital. By 1942 Townsville had become the supply base for World War II in the South-West Pacific. Australian Area Combined Headquarters for the North-east Area was established in Townsville as well as the United States Army Base Section Two, the Fourth Air Depot of the United States Army/Airforce, a naval replenishment port and a major transhipment centre for troops and supplies. Townsville was heavily defended with radar, searchlights and anti-aircraft installations. Fixed coastal defence installations were constructed on Mount Marlow at Pallarenda and on Magnetic Island. The facility at Pallarenda was designed to protect the northern entrance to Townsville Harbour and to protect the shipping passage between the mainland and Magnetic Island. The construction at Pallarenda included two gun emplacements, two searchlight installations, a command post and a sizeable camp. The complex was probably constructed by the Main Roads Department under direction from the Allied Works Council, which was the principal construction authority in Queensland for wartime installations such as roads, airstrips and coastal defence fortifications. The Station continued to function throughout World War II and up until the Malayan War when, between 1966 and 1974, the Hospital and Observance Block were taken over by the 9th Field Ambulance Corp Field Hospital. A new hospital building was constructed in 1973, mainly to treat contagious patients returning from the Vietnam War. The Hospital and Observation Block, built of material from the West Point site, were damaged during Cyclone Althea in December 1971 and demolished to make way for the new building. Although completed, the hospital was never used as a medical facility because of the construction of a contagious diseases hospital in Melbourne which accepted cases from all over Australia. The hospital was used as 4 Camp hospital by the Australian Army base at nearby Lavarack as a place for injured soldiers to recuperate after surgery etc. and was staffed by a doctor and several nurses, a cook, quartermaster, storeman, transport NCO and drivers for a period of time in the early 1970s. The construction of the Melbourne Contagious Disease Hospital marked the end of the Pallarenda facility as a place of quarantine. Planning to locate the recently established Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) into the complex began early in 1974. By November 1974 AIMS personnel had moved into six transportable laboratories and the former Quarantine Station buildings. AIMS remained until 1977 when the organisation moved to a permanent location at Cape Ferguson, south of Townsville. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GRBRMPA) was located in the present Marine Parks building for a short time, soon after it was established in 1975. However, after AIMS and GRBRMPA moved out, the complex remained empty until 1 February 1986 when the area was gazetted as an Environmental Park. The grounds of the former quarantine station were planted with native vegetation and the former Administration building occupied by the Marine Parks Section of the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage. The rest of the buildings were restored in 1991-1992 and occupied by the Northern Regional Office of the then Environmental Protection Agency.  Description  The former quarantine station is located at Cape Pallarenda on a rise behind coastal sand dunes. Mount Marlow rises from a small flood plain at the rear of the complex. There are sixteen timber buildings within the heritage register boundary, some of which were constructed at West Point and later moved and re-assembled at Cape Pallarenda. The buildings are set within a green rainforest setting which contributes to the tropical ambience of the site. The buildings are timber framed and clad with vertical chamfered timber boards. The buildings are supported on concrete stumps. The buildings that form part of the quarantine station include a central group: * Marine Parks/Coastal Management (former Administration/Doctors Building) * Conference Room/Planning Section (former First Class Quarters) * Reception/Library/Records/RDs office (former Second Class Quarters) * QNPWS/Conservation Strategy/Resources (former Dining Room) * Graphics Lab (former Kitchen) * Wetlands/GIS Mapping (former Married Quarters) * Administration/Accounts (former Engine Drivers Accommodation) To the south of this group is the Cultural Heritage/Engineering (former Manager's Residence). To the northern of the central group are the: * Habitat Hut (former Storage Shed) * Workshop (former Laundry) * Museum (former Disinfectant Block) * Storage Shed (former Shower Block) The roofs of the buildings are generally half hipped with ventilation panels in the small gable ends formed by the half hip. The roofs are clad with a mixture of corrugated iron sheeting and aluminium decking. The roofs in many cases extend over generous verandahs and are supported on stop chamfered columns. Between the timber columns are simple timber battened balustrades. The stairs which provide access to the buildings are generally open tread timber stairs with simple timber rail balustrade. The buildings feature double French doors opening onto the verandah spaces with operable transom windows above. Lining the original faces of the buildings are vertical sash timber framed windows. The former Manager's Residence features remnant interiors which are earlier than the other buildings of the complex. The former First Class Quarters and Second Class Quarters were originally two halves of the nineteenth century West Point Hospital Building, a large timber building with surrounding verandahs built on the pavilion planning principles. The former Married Quarters was originally the Hospital Kitchen, also moved from West Point. Another building from the West Point Quarantine Station site is the former Dining Room which was built as the single women's quarters. The central original dining room has been divided into several offices internally. The former administration block dates from 1915, and has a long east west axis comprising a core of offices arranged around a central hall with verandahs surrounding the building, measuring in width. The building is elevated on concrete stumps and has a low half hipped roof. A number of associated structures are found throughout the site defined by the heritage register boundary. These include World War II fortifications and various water structures. The World War II fortifications are located on the lower slopes of Mount Marlow, to the north west of the former quarantine station buildings at Pallarenda. The facilities are built on the rocky slopes with the command post on the highest point. There are five structures still surviving as well as concrete slabs in the accommodation area, drainage systems along the paths and a substantial piece of curbing and guttering along the track to the gun emplacements. Other visible evidence includes a large hole in rock with a remnant camouflage frame over it, a levelled area below the command post which is surrounded by a stone pitched wall and steps. The command post is a concrete building which comprises two rooms, one above the other, with observation slits cut at head height round three sides of the structure. Access to the building is from the northern side into the lower room and from the rear into the higher room. The gun emplacements are also built of concrete. The guns were protected by a cantilevered extension, with a shell store and cartridge store of reinforced concrete at the rear. Searchlight facilities are of similar construction without the rear store rooms. The road drainage system and curbing and guttering are of rock lined channels held in place with concrete. The level area below the command post is surrounded by a stone-pitched wall with concrete and stone steps. There is some evidence that the buildings were covered in camouflage paint. Some sections of the buildings have been painted in recent years in an attempt to cover graffiti. On the bank of a creek which runs beside the quarantine station is a concrete weir which was apparently built to supply water. The remnants of a stone jetty is sited near where this creek flows to the sea. An early timber footbridge provides carriage across the creek.  Heritage listing  The former Cape Pallarenda Quarantine Station was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The site demonstrates government and community attempts to eradicate and treat tropical disease and effect racial segregation at the turn of the century. The complex has historic links with seaborn immigration and early settlement of Townsville and North Queensland and with the development of Townsville as a port. These links extend to the various wars with which Australia has been involved and to the foundation of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and to the establishment of the Department of Environment and Heritage. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The former Cape Pallarenda Quarantine Station was constructed in 1915/16, under an Employment Enhancement Scheme and is one of few surviving early quarantine stations in Australia and the only substantially intact example in North Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The site comprises a coherent group of early 20th century timber buildings constructed for the Federal government and includes building elements from the 19th century quarantine station at West Point, Magnetic Island. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. These links extend to the various wars with which Australia has been involved and to the foundation of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and to the establishment of the Department of Environment and Heritage.

She was considered the undisputed master of the instrument, nicknamed the \\"Queen of Erhu\\". She composed some of her own hits, including \\"Yangguan Melody ‚Äì Three Variations\\" and \\"Wishes of the People of Honghu Lake.\\" Her most famous piece was the Great Wall Capriccio, composed by Liu Wenjin with her assistance. Life and career Min Huifen in her childhood Min was born in Yixing, Jiangsu Province in 1945. Her father began teaching her to play the erhu when she was eight. She studied at the Affiliated High School of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and then at the Department of Traditional Chinese Music of the Conservatory. After graduation, she went to Beijing to train under Liu Mingyuan and Lan Yusong, two northern masters of erhu. Her experience made her well versed in both the southern and northern traditions of the erhu. In 1963, she won the national prize at the Shanghai Spring Arts Festival, and was subsequently recognized as the undisputed master of erhu for more than 50 years until her death. After attending her performance in 1973, American music critic Harold Schonberg called her the \\"Heifetz of erhu\\". As a member of the Chinese art delegation, she toured the United States in 1978. Min was a member of the China National Art Troupe, and later became the solo erhu performer of the Shanghai Art Troupe. After 1978, she performed with the Shanghai Chinese Orchestra. In 1989, Min famously performed in support of the Tiananmen Square protests. After Beijing declared martial law on 20 May, she performed the melancholy Moon reflected on Erquan pond, for the student protesters in Shanghai supporting their Beijing colleagues. Works Min Huifen released 15 albums during her career. Her music is a unique blend of multiple genres of traditional Chinese music, including the Peking opera, the Yue opera, and the music of Chaozhou. She composed several of her hit singles herself, including \\"Yangguan Melody ‚Äì Three Variations\\" and \\"Wishes of the People of Honghu Lake.\\" Her most famous performance was the Great Wall Capriccio, composed by Liu Wenjin with Min's assistance. It was inspired by a huge tapestry of the Great Wall that Liu and Min saw during their visit to the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York in 1978. Awards * First Prize, National Erhu Playing Competition (1963) * Shanghai Literature and Art Award (1988) * First National Gold Record Award (1989) Health issues and death In 1981, Min was diagnosed with cancer, and underwent six major operations and fifteen courses of chemotherapy in the next five years. Doctors thought her cancer was terminal after it metastasized in 1983, but she miraculously recovered from the disease. However, Min still suffered from many health problems, including high blood pressure and hyperlipidemia. On 13 February 2014, she suffered a cerebral haemorrhage and fell into a coma. She never woke up again, and died on 12 May 2014 at Renji Hospital in Shanghai. She was 69. Family Min Huifen was born to a musical family. Her father Min Jiqian (), who outlived her, was a student of the erhu master Liu Tianhua. Her brother Min Lekang () is a national first-class conductor and music professor. Her younger sister, Min Xiaofen, is a well known pipa player. According to Min Lekang, who was more than ten years younger than Min Huifen, she taught her younger siblings the erhu and musical theory and had a significant impact on their careers.

G. Khouw, was a prominent philanthropist and landowner in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). He gained notoriety for acquiring Dutch citizenship, thus breaking down the race barriers of colonial society. Today, he is best remembered for his extravagant mausoleum in Petamburan, Jakarta. Family Born in 1874 in Batavia (now Jakarta), he was a scion of the Khouw family of Tamboen, part of the Cabang Atas or the Chinese gentry (baba bangsawan) of colonial Indonesia. His father, Khouw Tjeng Kee, Luitenant-titulair der Chinezen (died in 1883), was a prominent landlord and community leader. Khouw's father and uncles, Luitenant Khouw Tjeng Tjoan and Luitenant Khouw Tjeng Po, were the sons of the late eighteenth-century magnate, Luitenant Khouw Tian Sek (died in 1843). The Chinese lieutenancies of Khouw's father, uncles and grandfather were honorary appointments without any of the entailed governmental authority. As a descendant of Chinese officers, Khouw was born with the courtesy title of 'Sia'. His brothers, including Kapitein Khouw Oen Hoei, and many of his cousins, such as Kapitein Khouw Yauw Kie and most notably, Khouw Kim An, the fifth and last Majoor der Chinezen of Batavia, would later acquire substantive and ever higher appointments in the colonial administration. For almost two centuries, the family as a whole exerted a great deal of influence in colonial Indonesia through their extensive landownership and control of bureaucratic offices. Life O. G. Khouw was part of the first generation of Indonesians to receive a thoroughly western upbringing and education. Although he grew up in Batavia, Khouw spent most of his later life in fin-de-si√®cle Europe, primarily between Switzerland and the South of France. He was married to Lim Sha Nio, but did not have any children. Unlike many of his brothers and cousins, Khouw lived his life as a private citizen and eschewed official involvement in the colonial Chinese bureaucracy. He was one of the owners of a colonial banking corporation, Than Kie Bank, and - together with Tan Liok Tiauw and D. N. van Stralendorff - of Tendjo Ayoe, one of the largest tea and rubber plantations in Sukabumi. Despite his lack of involvement in the colonial bureaucracy, Khouw was nonetheless well-known as a generous patron and benefactor of many charitable causes, both in Indonesia and Europe. In 1901, together with Phoa Keng Hek and other community leaders, he helped establish Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan, a Chinese educational and cultural organization, and served as its inaugural Vice-President. (His cousin, Majoor Khouw Kim An, would later marry Phoa Keng Hek's daughter.) Khouw was also head of the hospitaalfonds 'Jang Seng Ie', which later grew to become Husada Hospital. After the outbreak of World War I, Khouw ‚Äì already living in Europe ‚Äì donated f. 40,000 for the Dutch Red Cross in 1915. Together with Mas Asmioen and Oey Tiang Hok, he shocked Dutch colonial society by becoming naturalized citizens of the Netherlands in 1908. In so doing, they bypassed the racial caste system of colonial Indonesia. Death and burial He died in 1927 at the spa town of Bad Ragaz in Switzerland. His ashes were transferred from Europe to Indonesia on board the SS Prins der Nederlanden. His last resting place, Mausoleum O. G. Khouw in Petamburan, is now a local landmark in Jakarta. It was constructed in the Art Deco style by G. Racina, an Italian contractor, at the then massive cost of f 500,000 (around US$250,000 at the time; or US$4.5 million in today's money). On its completion in 1932, the mausoleum's astronomical cost caused a sensation among the press of colonial Indonesia and the Netherlands. One commentator noted that Khouw's mausoleum was considerably more expensive than the burial memorial of American billionaire William Rockefeller in Sleepy Hollow, New York.

It was set up as an association (F√∂rderverein Cargo sous terrain) in September 2013, and was based at the headquarters of the Swiss retailer Coop in Basel. It converted itself into a share company (CST AG) on 24 March 2017.  Description  The providers claim to establish a complete, automated, flexible and durable underground cargo system which allows the transport of pallets and crates for packages, individual items, break bulk cargo and bulk goods, as well as their intermediate storage. Tunnels are scheduled to connect the sites of production and logistics sites. In the municipalities, under ground cargo is scheduled to distribute the goods by environmentally friendly vehicles in cooperation with partners of the Swiss retail syndicate IG DHS (Interessengemeinschaft Detailhandel Schweiz), among them Coop, Denner, Manor and Migros, and also the Swiss national logistics providers SBB Cargo, Rhenus Logistics, Swisscom and Swiss Post. The privately owned company claims also to contribute to waste disposal. According to the press release on 26 January 2016, the innovation in the field of cargo transport is in the unique combination of proven technologies; the system shall transport pallets and containers of any kind ... and provide the collection of waste and recyclable materials. In the cities, thanks to the present city-logistic system, Cargo Sous Terrain may provide solutions to the most urgent traffic problems. The providers claim to plan to use renewable energy for its operation. The technical and commercial feasibility of the planned Swiss national transport system shall have been confirmed by a feasibility study which was completed in 2015.  Network  Map of the Mittelland region of Switzerland The new type of underground freight infrastructure will be complementary to the Swiss road and rail network, and relieve it at critical points. The first scheduled section of about in the central Swiss Plateau (Mittelland) will connect H√§rkingen/Niederbipp and the city of Z√ºrich from the early 2030s. Later, a comprehensive network is planned between the Bodensee in eastern Switzerland and Lake Geneva in western Switzerland, with offshoots to Basel and Luzern. The tunnels will be built at a depth of up to and have a diameter of . In these tubes, three tracks will be placed, one in each direction plus a service lane in the middle, operating fully automated and unmanned vehicles which can transport two EUR-pallets and containers. Via ramps or lifts, these small vehicles, powered by electromagnetic induction, will load and unload automatically. The initiators believe that the vehicles will be able to travel round the clock and round the year at a speed of . An additional monorail system for packages, suspended in the crown of the tunnel, may run at twice that speed. On 20 April 2016 the government of the Canton of Z√ºrich announced that it had reservations, because it was still unclear whether CST would relieve congestion in the most important cantonal municipalities. In principle, the government welcomes the swap of goods to a separate mode of transport. According to the current level of knowledge it is questionable whether CST will benefit even the largest towns, since the traffic reduction would largely be on the interurban routes, while local road or rail distribution would increase traffic around the hubs. The government therefore asked the providers to clarify this aspect. The main shareholders Migros, Coop, Swisscom, Swiss Post, Credit Suisse, Z√ºrcher Kantonalbank, Mobiliar and Helvetia as well as the foreign partners Dagong Global Investment Group from China and Meridiam from France will contribute 100 million Swiss francs; the Swiss federal authorities have to ensure the legal framework for the project, the Executive Board announced at a media conference on 23 January 2018.  Costs (first phase)  The total cost for the first phase are estimated at 3,550 million Swiss Francs (CHF) of which 71 percent are scheduled for the construction of the tunnel. For matters of expense include CHF 282 million for the planning, CHF 344 million on the construction of ten hubs for loading and unloading. CHF 410 million francs are intended for the procurement of the vehicles.

After graduation from Yale College in 1822, he returned to Frankfort and studied law in the office of the Hon. Solomon P. Sharp. He was admitted to the bar, but never engaged in practice. Soon after completing his law studies he made an extended European tour. Subsequently, he was for several years engaged in the dry-goods business in Frankfort in partnership with his uncle, and he continued to be identified until his death with the business interests of the city. He accumulated a very large fortune and around 1840 built a large Federal style home at 312 Washington Street that exists today as a funeral home. He had no taste for political life, but was induced on one occasion, 1847, to serve as representative for his county in the Kentucky Legislature. He was married, May 26, 1858, to Ellen M.

The buildings were completed in 1862 and was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency in the Danish national registry of protected buildings and places on 11 November 2005. The complex includes the central workshop building (Danish: Centralv√¶rkstedet) and the smithy (Smedjen). The building complex is situated in the central Indre By neighborhood close to the Aarhus Central Station.  History  The first rail line in Jutland was established between Aarhus and Randers and a rail workshop was built in AArhus in 1862. The rail line and the workshop was built and operated by the English company Peto, Brassey and Betts. The workshop was established on an area between the Central Station and Spanien in a 3-winged complex with offices, smithy and a number of specialized workshops. During the war between Denmark and Germany in 1863‚Äì64 the workshop was closed down and in 1867 the Danish state took control of the Jutland-Fuenen railroads. In the decades after the war the railroad expanded greatly with ferry connections across Little Belt in 1872 and the Great Belt in 1883. In 1880 the state took control of the privately operated Zealand railroads and created the national Danish State Railroads or DSB. The workshop in Aarhus was named Centralv√¶rkstedet (English: Central Workshop) and became the primary workshop for train repair in Jutland and Fuenen. In the 1930s DSB had 750 locomotives and trams and almost 15.000 cars, primarily for cargo. About half belonged to the central workshop in Aarhus which annually made some 7-8000 car repairs and 250 locomotive repairs. Beyond maintenance and repair the workshop did refurbishment and built most spare parts and specialized tools. During the Second World War and the Occupation of Denmark in 1940‚Äì45 the Danish rail network suffered much damage and supply shortages meant old maintenance-heavy steam locomotives were taken back into service. The extraordinary need for repairs in the post-war years created a need for a lot of labor and the workshop was expanded. Over time the steam locomotives were gradually replaced by diesel trains and many regional rail lines were closed down so need for labor diminished again. In 1867 the workshop employed 100 men, in 1880 it had risen to 300, 750 in 1900, 1000 in 1920s and almost 1850 in 1949. After 1950 the number of employees fell steadily as work was gradually centralized in Copenhagen. In 1990 only 140 employees remained and DSB decided to close the workshop and sell the 16.000 m2 property. The buildings has since been renovated and are used for shops and conferences.  Architecture  The central workshops in Aarhus are the oldest train repair facilities in Denmark. The building complex has been extended and remodeled a number of times so it today illustrates the different industrial architectural styles from the 1860s to the mid-20th century. The buildings can be roughly divided in 4 periods. 1860-70s when the rail lines to Struer (1863‚Äì65), Fredericia (1868), Silkeborg (1871) og Gren√• (1877) was established. The smithy, Sibirien, Electrical Workshop and bogie Workshop are from this period. The car repair facility and paint shop is from around 1911. The car repair facility was expanded in 1930 and several of the existing buildings were remodeled. Finally, the large halls facing Spanien was built in 1940‚Äì59. The complex has examples of simple 1 story brick buildings barely different from a traditional warehouse and the hall-building which has the first locomotive repair workshop, both from 1862. The brick hall-building Sibirien was constructed between 1870 and 1880 and features brick arches to carry cranes which makes it unique in from other contemporary hall-buildings. The bogie workshop from 1883 is a flat brick building with unique tilted windows in the flat roof. The car repair facility from 1911 and 1932 is a characteristic example of the concrete hall-buildings developed in the interwar period.

One of the first religious female rappers in Israel, she has also performed in the United States, England, and India, and has appeared with artists like Y-Love, Kosha Dillz, and Roi Levi of Shotei Hanevuah. Early life Gutman was born in 1980 and grew up on the moshav of Nehalim. She comes from a family of rabbis, most notably her grandfather, former rosh yeshiva and Knesset member Rabbi Yosef Ba-Gad. Gutman's mother enrolled her in piano lessons when she was six, and she began composing melodies at a young age. Raised on Hasidic artists like Avraham Fried, she was exposed to secular music when her parents, working as emissaries for the Jewish Agency for Israel, moved the family to Canada while she was in middle school. She was introduced to hip hop through the soundtrack to the 1995 film Dangerous Minds. In her early twenties, Gutman drifted away from religious observance, although she later became a baalat teshuva. Career Gutman began her career as a singer-songwriter playing jazz and folk before turning to hip hop and reggae. While living in New York City, she would perform at the local jazz clubs. After moving back to Israel, she began performing locally with some rappers who had moved there from the United States and wrote her first song about her cousin, who was killed in a terrorist attack during the Second Intifada, and performed it for her family. In late 2009, while visiting England, Gutman collaborated with David Dan, a Jamaican Jewish reggae singer, on the song Agas (\\"Pear\\"), for which they also shot a music video. The song, with lyrics in Hebrew and English, describes a complicated relationship. In 2010, she performed at the sixth annual Jewlicious Festival alongside Matisyahu, Moshav, Rav Shmuel, Electro Morocco, and Kosha Dillz. After a five- year hiatus, Gutman returned in 2015 with the song and video Shirat Ha'asavim Hashotim (\\"Song of the Weeds\\"). Written shortly after a local Orthodox rabbi had been accused of sexual harassment, the song uses dark humor to attack male authority figures taking advantage of women. The video features Gutman playing nine characters, including a rabbi, a policeman, a singer, a politician, and their respective victims. The song was produced by Hatikva 6 members Amit Sagie and Lior Shulman, the latter of whom also raps on the song, portraying the male authority figures. Musical style Gutman performs hip hop with elements of reggae and jazz. Her influences include Adele, Lauryn Hill, Aretha Franklin, Corinne Bailey Rae, and Tanya Stephens. Her lyrics often deal with her personal life and social protest, and occasionally incorporate quotes from scripture.

Early life Born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1857 to enslaved parents, Parker worked a variety of jobs including as a newspaper salesman for the Southern Recorder and as a constable. He later moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he was employed as a waiter, before returning to Atlanta, where he appears in city directories as a mail carrier for the United States Postal Service Weatherbe,Ch[arles] F. (1885) Weatherbe's Atlanta, Ga. Duplex City Directory, Dunlop & Cohen, Printers, Stationers and Engravers, p. 299. This was followed by additional moves to Saratoga, New York, to New York, New York, and, finally, to Buffalo, New York where he took a job with a catering company at the Pan-American Exposition's Plaza Restaurant. McKinley assassination=Background= Parker had been laid off from his job at the Plaza Restaurant prior to September 6, 1901, and used that day to visit the Exposition's Hall of Music, where President William McKinley was receiving members of the public. The recent assassinations of European leaders by anarchists, and often virulent denouncements of McKinley in the newspapers of William Randolph Hearst, combined to concern McKinley's private secretary George B. Cortelyou that there might be an attempt on the president's life. Cortelyou arranged for tight security after the president twice refused to cancel his appearance. A contingent of up to 75 City of Buffalo police and exposition security guards monitored the doors to the Hall of Music and patrolled the queue waiting to see the president. Persons who made it far enough to approach McKinley finally had to pass through a cordon of U.S. Army soldiers who had been instructed to quickly surround anyone who appeared suspicious. Since the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the United States Secret Service had been protecting McKinley, and two special agents, backed by several Buffalo police detectives, stood near the president. =Shooting= Parker, left, grabs Czolgosz in a drawing by T. Dart Walker depicting the assassination. There was, at the time, a general rule that anyone approaching the president must do so with their hands open and empty. However, the heat of the day meant this custom was not being enforced as many people were carrying handkerchiefs with which to wipe away perspiration. A long line of exposition attendees queued to meet the president. The man in front of Parker in the queue, Leon Czolgosz, used the heat to conceal a pistol underneath a handkerchief. As Czolgosz approached McKinley, he fired the weapon twice, hitting the president at point blank range. After the second shot, according to a later account by United States Secret Service special agent Samuel Ireland, Parker punched Czolgosz in the neck then tackled him to the ground. Parker was quickly joined by one of the soldiers and a Buffalo policeman in restraining Czolgosz who was badly pummeled by more soldiers, police, and bystanders before McKinley could order the beating to stop. An unnamed witness cited in a Los Angeles Times story said that \\"with one quick shift of his clenched fist, he [Parker] knocked the pistol from the assassin's hand. With another, he spun the man around like a top and with a third, he broke Czolgosz's nose. A fourth split the assassin's lip and knocked out several teeth.\\" In Parker's own account of the event, given in a newspaper interview a few days later, he said, In a separate interview given to the New York Journal, Parker remarked \\"just think, Father Abe freed me, and now I saved his successor from death, provided that bullet he got into the president don't kill him.\\" =Aftermath= The headline of a story on Parker that ran in the Cincinnati Enquirer following the assassination reads \\"Modest as Well as Fearless is the Negro Waiter Parker.\\" After the shooting, Parker was approached with several commercial offers, including from one company who wanted to sell his photograph. He refused, stating in a newspaper interview that \\"I do not think that the American people would like me to make capital out of the unfortunate circumstances. I am glad that I was able to be of service to the country.\\" Prior to McKinley's death, when his outlook for recovery appeared promising, the Savannah Tribune, an African-American newspaper, trumpeted of Parker \\"the life of our chief magistrate was saved by a Negro. No other class of citizens is more loyal to this country than the Negro.\\" Despite initial optimism that McKinley would recover, the president died about a week later of complications arising from his wound. Czolgosz was quickly tried and convicted in the Erie County Superior Court and, exactly 45 days after McKinley's death, executed, his body afterwards being dissolved in acid. Parker was not called to testify, though his attempt to save the president was later lauded in a speech given by Booker T. Washington. Preacher Lena Doolin Mason wrote a poem praising Parker for his actions, \\"A Negro In It\\", casting him as the latest in a long line of African Americans who risked their lives in service to their country and admonishing white Americans to recognize that bravery with the cessation of lynchings. Later life After the assassination, Parker left Buffalo, and after spending the Christmas holidays with his family in Atlanta traveled through the United States giving lectures to enthusiastic crowds at such places as Nashville, Tennessee, Long Branch, New Jersey, Brooklyn, New York, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. On the first anniversary of the assassination, Parker was the principal speaker at a memorial service at the People's AME Zion Church in Providence, Rhode Island. Although there was talk of Parker being appointed as a messenger to the United States Senate, nothing seems to have come of it, and he subsequently went to work as a traveling salesman for the New York City based Gazetteer and Guide, an African-American interest magazine written for Pullman Porters and railroad and hotel employees.Danky, James P., editor, and Maureen E. Hady, assistant editor (1998) African- American Newspapers and Periodicals: A Bibliography (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press),p. 138 Details on his later activities are unknown.

In the station house, Parker \\"raved all night.\\" The following morning, a police surgeon examined Parker and determined that \\"his mind was subject to hallucinations and that it was dangerous for him to be at large\\" and Parker was therefore admitted to Philadelphia State Hospital at Byberry Parker was only at the hospital for a short time; he died at 2:10 pm on April 13, 1907, the cause being given as myocarditis with a contributory cause given as nephritis Pennsylvania Historic and Museum Commission; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania (State).

It was designed by Queensland Department of Public Works and built in 1921. It is also known as Magnetic Island State School No. 1567 and Magnetic Island Craft Shop. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 June 1996.  History  The Magnetic Island State School was constructed in 1921, probably by local builder Mr Shrock, and replaced an earlier provisional school building erected in 1913. The island was first settled by the Butler family in 1877. Harry Butler and his family established a small dairy, orchard and a mixed farm in Picnic Bay. The family experimented with the planting of pineapples and after building small huts adjacent to their house the island became a favourite weekend and holiday destination for mainland people. They also established a ferry service which operated well into the 20th century. Other settlers had established farms in accessible bays round the island by the early 1900s. Vegetables, pineapples and fruit were grown for sale on the mainland. Tourist development of the island began in earnest when Robert Hayles built an hotel at Picnic Bay in 1901. The island's reputation as a holiday resort brought many settlers to the various bays where guest houses and holiday huts were established. Tourism has continued to be the chief source of livelihood for many people residing on Magnetic Island. With the early 20th century expansion of settlement on Magnetic Island came the need for the provision of local education. Although free, secular, compulsory education had been introduced to Queensland with the Education Act of 1875, school fees and contributions to school building funds still had to be met by parents, and compulsory attendance was rarely enforced prior to 1900. Magnetic Island children who did receive an education during this period generally boarded on the mainland and attended the Townsville schools. Educational reform was slow in coming to Queensland as a result of the financial constraints placed on the Government by depression and subsequent drought during the latter part of the 19th century. Change began after the Education Act Amendment Act of 1912 abolished the need for local people to contribute to their children's education, raised the minimum leaving age from 12 to 14 years and reinforced compulsory primary school attendance. These regulations imposed considerable hardship on Magnetic Island families because the children were obliged to go to school on the mainland. They were forced to board with friends because schools in the town did not provide boarding facilities. The lack of education facilities on the island had become a serious problem which was exacerbated as the population grew. In November 1912 a group of Magnetic Island residents, including Dodd S Clarke, editor of the Townsville Daily Bulletin, formed a committee to pursue the establishment of a provisional school on the island. The District Inspector of Schools visited Picnic Bay and recommended that a half-time school be established, with a teacher from the mainland appointed to operate the school from 3.30pm to 5pm on Thursdays and all day Friday and Saturday. In April 1913 the Department of Public Instruction agreed that if the parents could arrange accommodation for the school and the visiting teacher, approval would be given for the establishment of a half-time school at Picnic Bay. Mary McLennan, the first teacher appointed to the island, commenced work on 12 June 1913, in an open-sided shed with a concrete floor. The half-time school became a provisional school in 1915 and on 1 June 1920 was formally taken over by the Department of Public Instruction as a state school. In 1921 the Magnetic Island community campaigned for a new school building. Pressure was also placed on the Department of Public Instruction by the Townsville City Council, who stressed the need for new accommodation for the 27 students at the school. In response, a new, one-roomed school house was built in 1921. Constructed to a Department of Works design, the new school, with open verandahs front and back, cost . The earlier school building became the play shed. In November 1924 the Department of Public Instruction suggested a name change from Magnetic Island State School to Picnic Bay State School because there was now another school on the Island. The school committee accepted the name change in January 1925. In October 1927 the Picnic Bay Progress Association applied to rent half the school grounds for a sports field. The Department refused but agreed that the school grounds outside the fenced school building could be used for recreation purposes. The school committee led an active campaign in the 1930s to have a well sunk and a windmill erected on the school reserve. They succeeded and the well and windmill were constructed in 1937. The south end of the front verandah was enclosed in September 1939 to create a hat room and the play shed was demolished in July‚ÄìAugust 1940. Electricity was connected at the end of 1955 and the rear verandah was enclosed during September and October 1958 to create more classroom space. By the 1960s there were three schools on Magnetic Island. In rationalising its assets at this period, the Education Department decided to phase out the schools at Picnic and Horseshoe Bays, and to develop the school at Nelly Bay because of its central location on the island. The Picnic Bay State School functioned until May 1970. The building remained vacant until occupied in 1980 by the newly established Magnetic Island Craft Co-Operative, which conducted a shop from the building. Later it became the Magnetic Island Museum.  Description  The building consists of one room with a front verandah and an enclosed rear verandah. Timber and iron decorative window hoods protect all the windows. The roof has been replaced with corrugated iron although original gutters are intact. The exterior of the building is clad with chamferboard. It is high set on concrete stumps with centrally placed front steps leading to a partially open front verandah. The exposed framing is a feature of the front verandah with the right end wall and part of the front enclosed with weatherboard. The remainder of the verandah has simple broomstick balustrading. The original front door remains in situ. It is a heavy timber panelled door which retains its original latch. The size of the central room is . The timber floor boards throughout the building are wide as are the walls and ceiling boards. The ceiling in the original room is flat and slopes away to the front and rear to meet the walls. Ventilation is provided in the ceiling by a centrally placed latticed vent and by means of moveable floor vents situated at the base of the front wall. Cross ventilation is provided by casement windows on the north and south walls. Each pair of casements has a three paned hopper above, which can be opened. Fittings on the windows on the southern wall are original. Access to the enclosed rear verandah is through a wide archway cut in the rear wall of the central room. The interior walls of the back verandah have been lined with fibro and hopper windows installed in the north and south walls. The tongue and groove ceilings on both verandahs slope down in line with the fall of the main ceiling. The original back door, constructed of tongue and groove boards retains some of its early fittings. The rear steps appear original and lead to a small landing. The remains of two tank stands are located outside the building on the southern wall and the original drinking trough and hand basin are in their original position under the building. A more modern toilet block has been constructed under the rear of the building. The grounds contain plantings of introduced trees such as tamarind and frangipanni. The reserve is dotted with gum trees, a Norfolk Island pine and some Burdekin plums. The grounds are enclosed with cyclone wire fencing.  Heritage listing  The former Picnic Bay State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 June 1996 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former school is significant for its relationship to a period of early tourism and settlement on Magnetic Island and to a growth in public concern for education, in the first few decades of the 20th century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is significant also as a regional example of a one-roomed school structure, typical of the period (1920s), in remote areas of Queensland.

Demagnez was a frequent exhibitor at the annual Salon art exhibition in Paris, and was one of only a few women whose works were juried into the show at that time in history. She is best known for her stone statue called Source d‚Äôamour and her monumental war memorial statue at Saint-Chaptes that memorializes soldiers killed in both the First and Second World War. Demagnez died in Paris in 1925. Early life and education Demagnez was born in Paris, France, in 1869. During a time in history when very few women ventured into the male-dominated world of bronze sculpture, Demagnez‚Äôs work was deemed to be of such good quality that she broke the barrier and was allowed to exhibit her work in what was at the time arguably the world‚Äôs most important art show‚Äîthe annual Salon exhibition.Levey, Michael. (1993) Painting and Sculpture in France 1700-1789. New Haven: Yale University Press, p. 3. She studied sculpture under the direction of Antonin Merci√© at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Career M√©lancolie, a stone sculpture by Demagnez, Although perhaps best known for her World War I Memorial at Saint-Chaptes, she also produced a number of bust sculptures featuring prominent French citizens. Among these is a bronze bust of , cast by the A. A. H√©brard foundry, that she completed in 1911. Her circa 1895 stone sculpture entitled M√©lancolie was described in 1902 by an art critic who said, \\"The work has delicate and thoroughly feminine sentiment, and is distinctly praiseworthy, albeit the execution shows marks of indecision and inexperience\\". Demagnez won a bronze medal at the 1900 Exposition Universelle and also participated in the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition (informally known as the St. Louis World‚Äôs Fair) where she presented a stone statue called Poetry. Demagnez completed an important World War I memorial in 1919 that is now located in Languedoc-Roussillon, Gard, Saint-Chaptes, France, in the Town Hall Square. It is made of stone, concrete and iron. It depicts a woman draped and crowned with laurel raising a palm with a soldier standing guard nearby. Engraved on the bas-relief are the names of those soldiers from Saint-Chaptes that gave their lives for France in the First World War. The concrete portion was edited by Coignet of Paris. A plaque indicating the dead from this town in the Second World War was added sometime after that war ended in 1945. Death Demagnez died in Paris in 1925.

Garcia. Under the policy, Filipino-owned business is prioritized over its foreign counterparts, and the patronizing of Filipino-made products by Filipinos was also promoted. History=Under President Carlos P. Garcia= President Carlos P. Garcia introduced the Filipino First policy. The policy of Garcia, was a response to the impact of free trade and American economic dominance in the Philippines for years following the World War II. It is meant to assert greater Filipino role over the country's economy if not to gain control of it by promoting \\"Filipino business establishment\\". Garcia first instituted the policy with the issuance of Resolution No. 202 of the National Economic Council on August 28, 1958. The policy dictates that Filipinos would have preference over non- Filipinos in receiving foreign exchange. In line with the policy, Garcia pledged that his administration would assist Filipino entrepreneurs to make ventures in industries dominated by non-Filipinos. The policy received positive reception from Filipino businessmen, and there were calls to expand the scope of the policy to include other spheres of society such as education. However, it received negative reception from foreign businessmen, particularly the Americans, Chinese, along with their Chinese-Filipino counterparts. Chinese-Filipinos in particular accused the policy of discrimination over its interpretation of who is a \\"Filipino\\" and felt marginalized by the policy. The opposition branded the policy as a political propaganda meant to win support from the public to secure Garcia's reelection as President in the next elections. Critics has also labeled the policy as being \\"anti-foreign\\" Garcia in response to his critics said that his policy was not meant to foster Filipino \\"exclusiveness\\" or was meant to be \\"anti-foreign\\" and stated that the Philippines will not close itself to foreign capital. He asserts that the policy is meant to give Filipinos priority in relation to the control over the country's basic industries and their development. =1987 Constitution= The Filipino First policy may also refer to a set of provisions found in the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines which gives Filipinos preferential treatment in the national economy over foreigners.
