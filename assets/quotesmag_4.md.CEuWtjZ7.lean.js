In keeping with a memorial to the town's fallen soldiers, there are two cannons (one from the American Civil War, the other from the First World War) in front of the building. The hall, which was built of the locally quarried granite (from the same quarry that supplied granite for the Springfield Armory), the building's basic shape is that of a T. The northwest (left front) corner has a four-story tower, and the southwest (right front) corner has a smaller octagonal turret. In between, a gabled pavilion is centered on the front faced perpendicular to the main roofline. The stem of the T extends northeast to the rear of the building. Arches and other decorative elements are shaped out of ashlar granite in alternating light and dark colors. The building's roof is slate; the front portion is hipped, with the center interrupted by the front-facing gable. The rear section ends in a gable. Inside the hall, the front houses town offices, and a space that was originally used as a GAR meeting space, and the rear of the building houses an auditorium with stage. Interior spaces have not been significantly altered since the building's construction was completed, and most continue to be used for their original purpose. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, and was included as a contributing property in the Monson Center Historic District in 1991.

Academic work and publications  Povinelli‚Äôs work has focused on developing a critical theory of late liberalism that would support an anthropology of the otherwise. This critical task is animated by a critical engagement with the traditions of American pragmatism and continental immanent critique and grounded in the circulation of values, materialities, and socialities within settler liberalisms. Her first two books examined the governance of the otherwise in late liberal settler colonies from the perspective of the politics of recognition. In particular, they focused on impasses within liberal systems of law and value as they meet local Australian indigenous worlds, and the effect of these impasses on the development of legal and public culture in Australia. Her second two books, The Empire of Love: Toward a Theory of Intimacy, Genealogy, and Carnality and Economies of Abandonment: Social Belonging and Endurance in Late Liberalism, examine formations of the Late Liberal Anthropocene from the perspective of intimacy, embodiment, and narrative form.Haus der Kulteren der Welt, The Anthropocene Project She was the recipient of the German Transatlantic Program Prize and Fellow at the American Academy in Berlin for Fall 2011.

They occupied an entire city block on the east side of Main Street, between Union and Hubbard Streets, and were some of the city's best examples of commercial Italianate architecture, prior to their destruction in the 2011 Springfield tornado. They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Mills, Hale, and Owen blocks formed a single monolithic block on Main Street between Union and Hubbard Streets on Springfield's south side. The Mills and Hale Blocks occupied the left portion of the block, and were both three stories in height, with similarly styled cornices of equal height. Both had several ground-floor retail spaces, with recessed entrances flanked by plate glass windows. Upper-story windows were set in segmented arches, with keystoned lintels; those on the Hale Block had a more elaborate brick corbelling in the surround. The Owen Block, at the right end, was four stories in height. Pilasters separated the upper story window bays into pairs, and the ground- floor storefronts were topped by pressed tin frieze. The Mills and Hale blocks were both built in 1874, and were two of the best examples of Italianate architecture of the period in the city. They were also the first major buildings built in a push to extend the downtown area to the south, and introduced the mixed use style of building use to the area. The Owen Block was built in 1899 in a Classical Revival style reflective of the further expansion of Springfield's downtown area. All three buildings housed a variety of retail businesses on their ground floors. The upper floors of the Mills block were first used as a boarding house, while those of the other two served as residential tenement-style housing. The buildings were rehabilitated in the 1980s, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The buildings sustained extreme damage during the 2011 Springfield tornado, with the top floor of at least one of the buildings partially collapsing. The buildings were demolished eight days later due to the irreparable damage.http://www.masslive.com/business- news/index.ssf/2012/06/tornado_victims_sue_city_of_springfield.html See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Springfield, Massachusetts *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hampden County, Massachusetts References Category:Commercial blocks on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures in Springfield, Massachusetts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Springfield, Massachusetts Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Massachusetts ","title":"Mills-Hale-Owen Blocks"},{"id":"18732978","text":"The Mills-Stebbins Villa is a historic house at 3 Crescent Hill in Springfield, Massachusetts. Described as the \\"best work\\" of architect Henry Sykes, this Italian style villa was built between 1849 and 1851 for John Mills, a prominent Springfield attorney. Mills died in 1861, and the villa was acquired by John Stebbins, a banker, real estate developer, and local politician. It fell into decline in the 20th century, but was rehabilitated and restored in the early 1970s. The villa is located at the top of a ridge that historically separated Springfield's downtown and working class South End from the more upscale Maple Street Hill area. It was built of brick that was probably once covered with a stucco-style mastic. The most prominent architectural feature is a tower at the front of the house that echoes the style of an Italian Renaissance campanile. The massing of the building falls away in successive stages. The brickwork is relieved by stone and wood detailing, and there are a few unusual windows on the front facade. A service wing was added to the rear of the house c. 1900. Inside the building, the formal rooms of the house were on the north side, while the central part of the house contains the bedrooms and a library. The service wing added space for a nursery on the south side. A number of rooms included full-length windows that provided access to outdoor spaces, including a patio area on the north side as well as several balconies. The villa was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and included as a contributing property to the Ames Hill/Crescent Hill District in 1974.

While calling games for the Estevan Bruins, Boston Bruins President Weston Adams heard Laing's play by play on scouting trips. Adams was very impressed with Laing's impartiality, especially in games between Estevan and their rivals, the Weyburn Red Wings. According to Boston Bruins announcer Fred Cusick, Laing \\"was a dead ringer, in voice and inflection, for Foster Hewitt, Canada's legendary hockey announcer\\". He was hired by Adams in 1966 to call Bruins games on radio. Laing was 23 years old at the time of his hiring. During his tenure in Boston, he was praised by Boston Globe sportswriter Harold Kaese for being \\"objective and accurate\\". Laing was fired after only one season because Bruins management believed that he tended to lean on the negative. He was replaced by Bob Wilson the following season.

The factory was built beginning in about 1880, and expanded over the next decades to include a variety of brick multi-story buildings that are relatively utilitarian in appearance. When built, the property belonged to George Tapley, a principal in the Taylor and Tapley Manufacturing Company and a childhood friend of Milton Bradley. Bradley had entered the toy business in the 1860s, and moved his company to Tapley's premises in 1882. The success of his eponymous company led to a significant expansion of the premises, which eventually came to occupy an entire city block. The facilities were used in all aspects of toy and game manufacturing, including a lithographic print shop. The company moved its manufacturing to suburban East Longmeadow in the 1960s, and the complex was converted into residential housing in the late 1970s. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The complex is located just south of downtown Springfield, and is a roughly U-shaped collection of buildings, bounded on the south by Park Street, the west by Willow Street, and the north by a continuation of Cross Street. The buildings are all of brick construction, and range in height from two to six stories. Elements of architectural interest include windows set in segmented-arch openings with brick corbelling, corner quoining, and parapets at the rooftops.

It was designed to house stores on the first floor and offices on the second, functions it continues to perform. It was rehabilitated in the early 1980s and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Morgan Block is located in downtown Springfield, on the south side of Bridge Street at the southern end of Stearns Park. It is a long two-story building, with a brick exterior. The front is divided into seven bays articulated by quoined brick piers, with a building entrance in a round-arch opening at the left end. The piers are topped by Classical medallions, and a low parapet extends across the top. The ground- floor bays originally housed individual retail storefronts with recessed entrances, but most of these have been replaced with plate glass windows set on granite bases. On the second floor there are two sash windows in each bay, set in separate rectangular openings. The block was built in 1929 to a design by Kirkham & Parlett, on what was previously the site of a laundry.

Description and history The William Norcross House is located in the village center of Monson, on the north side of Cushman Street a short way east of Main Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a central chimney, a hip roof that has a central monitor section, and a clapboarded exterior.

Secondary entrances added later are located on the street-facing eastern facade. The house was constructed about 1785 by William Norcross, a cabinetmaker and joiner who had purchased the property in 1776. Norcross operated a tavern on the premises, which was a major social center in the early days of the town, and was influential in the development of the area as Monson's economic center. The Norcrosses had by the early 19th century ended its use as a tavern, and in 1835 sold it to the owners of a textile mill which had begun operations across the street in 1815. The mill broke the interior down into separate units, which it rented to mill workers. After the mill closed in 1927, the mill owners continued to operate it as a boarding house. They made only modest alterations to the exterior, principally enlarging the kitchen ell to a full two stories in height. It has since gone through a succession of owners, and remains in use as a residential rental property.

The building is actually three separate 19th-century buildings that were conjoined by internal connections in 1929, making a good example of adaptive reuse of commercial architecture in the city. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Olmsted- Hixon-Albion Block is located in downtown Springfield, at the northwest corner of Taylor and Main Streets. Overall, the building is five stories in height, and retains the facades of its original constituent buildings. The leftmost Olmsted Block is finished mainly in red brick, with a single retail storefront on the ground floor, and is two bays wide on the upper floors, each bay holding pairs of sash windows. The edges of the facade have stone quoining, and the building is capped by a frieze and cornice. The central Hixon Block houses the main building entrance on the ground floor, and has a two-bay copper-clad window bay on the second and third floors, flanked by sash windows. The top two floors have six bays of sash windows; the floors are set apart by bands of brick corbelling. The rightmost Albion Block houses two storefronts (most recently operating as a single unit) with central recessed entrances flanked by display windows. The second floor has three banks of three windows, each topped by a transom, with a cornice separating the second and third floors. The three bays of the upper floors are articulated by pilasters, each housing paired sash windows, with terra cotta panels between the floors. The Olmsted Block (1645-1649 Main Street) was built in 1875 by John C. Olmsted, a leading businessman and banker in the city, and used as an office building. The Hixon Block (1653-1655 Main Street) was built in 1862 for John Hixon, a wholesale shoe and boot manufacturer. His premises was used by a paper products manufacturer after his death. The Albion Block (1657-1659) was built in 1866 as a boarding house; it was acquired in 1877 by the Bay State Paper Company, which gave the building its name and converted it into office space. The three buildings were unified in 1927 according to plans drafted by Wallace Dibble for the Walter Young Realty Trust, which had purchased them over the preceding 20 years.

The Romanesque building was designed by New York City architect R. H. Robertson and constructed in 1890 as a memorial to the town's Civil War dead; it was also used as a meeting space by the local Grand Army of the Republic veterans society. The ground floor served as the town's public library until 1977. It has since served as Palmer's Senior Center. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description and history Palmer Memorial Hall is located one block off Palmer's downtown Main Street, at the southeast corner of Pleasant and Central Streets. it is a 1-1/2 story red brick building, with a red brick exterior, hip roof, and granite foundation. The front facade is dominated by a projecting gabled pavilion, which houses the main entrances in a pair of similar round-arch recesses with terra cotta decorative elements. Above these in the gable are three tall round-arch windows. The pavilion is flanked on each side by two round-arch windows, above which hip-roof wall dormers rise through the main roof. The building interior was designed for use as a library on the ground floor, and a meeting space on the second floor. The hall was designed by Robert H. Robertson of New York City, and was built in 1890-91 as a memorial to the city's Civil War dead, a meeting place for the Grand Army of the Republic, and to house the public library. It is the city's best example of the Richardsonian Romanesque style. Palmer's first library was founded in 1815 as a private subscription library, but it and subsequent attempts to maintain a library failed until 1878. In that year, the Young Men's Library Association purchased the collection of a recent failed association, and opened a public reading room in a commercial storefront on Central Street. Calls for a permanent collection and building began in the 1880s, as did calls for a war memorial. In 1890, Dr. W.H. Stowe donated land for the building, and the building was formally dedicated in April 1891. The library association relinquished control of the library to the city in 1963, and it moved into new premises in 1977. The library space now serves as a senior center, and the GAR hall serves as meeting space for the community.

The shortened versions have come down to us in Greek (named Meneo), Romanian and Slavic.Turdeanu E. Apocryphes slaves et roumain de l'Ancient Testament, Leiden 1981 4 Baruch is usually dated to the first half of the 2nd century AD. Abimelech's sleep of 66 years, instead of the usual 70 years of Babylonian captivity, makes scholars tend toward the year AD 136, that is, 66 years after the fall of the Second Temple in AD 70. This dating is coherent with the message of the text. 4 Baruch uses a simple and fable-like style, with speech-making animals, fruit that never rots, and an eagle sent by the Lord that revives the dead. Some parts of 4 Baruch appear to have been added in the Christian era, such as the last chapter; due to these insertions, some scholars consider 4 Baruch to have Christian origins. Like the greater prophets, it advocates the divorce of foreign wives and exile of those who will not do so. According to 4 Baruch, the Samaritans are the descendants of such mixed marriages. Content The Lord reveals to Jeremiah that Jerusalem will be destroyed because of the impiety of the Israelites. Jeremiah informs Baruch, and that night they see angels open the door to the city. Jeremiah is instructed by the Lord to miraculously hide in the earth the vestments of the high priest of the Temple. The Chaldeans enter Jerusalem, and Jeremiah follows the Israelites into exile, while Baruch remains in Jerusalem. Abimelech (= Ebedmelech the Ethiopian of Jeremiah 38:7) falls asleep for 66 years and awakens next to a basket of figs, preserved perfectly fresh. Because the figs are fresh out of season, Abimelech realizes that he slept for years miraculously. Abimelech reunites with Baruch. They want to communicate with Jeremiah, who is still in Babylon, so Baruch prays to the Lord, who sends him an eagle. The eagle takes a letter and some of the figs to Jeremiah. It finds Jeremiah officiating at a funeral and alights on the corpse, bringing it back to life, thus announcing the end of the exile. The Israelites return to Jerusalem, but only those men who have no foreign wives are allowed to pass the Jordan. History of the Babylonian captivity This Jewish pseudepigraphical text belongs to the cycle of Baruch and is related to 4 Baruch. It is longer and probably older than 4 Baruch.Kuhn, K.H.

Portions of the tower have applied Stick style woodwork. The interior retains many features original to its construction, including builtin cabinets, wooden paneling, and flooring. Several of the fireplace surrounds were replaced in 1909 by the building's original owner, Thomas Page. The house was built about 1875, and is the most elaborate example of Queen Anne styling in Chicopee. Thomas Page was an industrialist who came to Chicopee in 1867, and was involved in a number of manufacturing businesses. He owned patents to knitting machines, which he used in the production of cotton textiles. He later branched out into other businesses, including the early manufacture of bicycles, which eventually came to dominate the business. Page sold the house to the local Masonic lodge in 1909, which added the ell to the rear, and made other modest alterations to the interior.

Originally called Prospect Park when it was laid out in 1884, it was given its present name in 1939 in honor of American Revolutionary War hero Casimir Pulaski, for whom there is a memorial in the park's center. The original park was designed by the Olmsted Brothers landscape design firm. Description The park's northern border is a crescent-shaped stretch of the Connecticut River. The shore is lined by a long concrete wall (built 1905‚Äì1910), which is interrupted every ten feet by a squat pier, and by four lookouts that jut over the embankment. A concrete promenade runs along the wall, providing views of the river. The southern edge of the park abuts the properties that line the north side of St. Kolbe Street. South and east of the historic core of the park lies Feldman Park, an adjoining city property that consists primarily of sports fields. On the west end of the park is another small park area with tennis courts. The center of the park has a small garden enclosed by a wrought iron fence, in which is a boulder on which is mounted a bronze plaque memorializing Casimir Pulaski. The historic core of the park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. History When the city of Holyoke was laid out in the 1840s, the parcel of land that became the park was not immediately identified for use as such. The area, which did not have a defined use in early plans, became known as \\"The Patch\\", and was an area where Irish immigrant workers who built the city's canals and infrastructure built a shantytown. The grid of city streets ended at the area's southern boundary, a street named Prospect Street, as it was built out during the second half of the 19th century. Sometime between 1865 and 1884 the area was cleared of shanties, and informal use of the area as a park began. The city's many Irish residents referred to it as \\"Kerry Park\\", after County Kerry and the green views of the surrounding area the park afforded. In 1884 the Holyoke Water Power Company, owner of the land, gave it to the city, and its formal existence as Prospect Park began. Between 1884 and 1898 the park's paths were laid out, and landscaping and planting took place. Features built in this time that have not survived include a bandstand and an ornamental pump house used to bring water up from a spring in the river embankment. The park edge along the river was lined with a wooden fence. In a 1901 review of the park, John C. Olmsted recommended the construction of a more permanent retaining wall with either wrought iron railing or stone parapet; this suggestion led to the construction of the existing concrete wall. Olmsted also recommended changes to the landscaping to improve the park's appearance. By the mid-20th century the area surrounding the park became characterized by the city's Polish population. On May 7, 1939 the park was renamed after Casimir Pulaski in ceremonies featuring a parade from Mater Dolorosa to the park with more than 500 people in attendance representing local Polish community organizations. In addition to city and state officials, one John Lazarewicz, an official from the Polish Consulate in New York City also presided over the ceremony. One of Holyoke's native sons, Polish-American historian Edward Pinkowski, would later re-discover Pulaski's forgotten burial site in Savannah, Georgia, in 1996. During a phase of urban renewal in the 1960s, the area south of the park was redeveloped. The grid character of its streets was altered, with only Maple Street providing access from the street grid to the park. Prospect Street was removed at this time for the development of the properties that now abut the park.

After Santaji, Dhanaji became the chief of the Maratha army in 1696 and remained on the post until his death in 1708.  Background  Dhanaji was born in or around 1650, to the Maratha family from Sindh khed to Santaji Jadhav. Dhanaji was brought up by Shivaji's mother Jijabai after assassination of Dhanaji's grandfather Achloji, who was Jijabai's brother. Santaji's son Shambhu (Sambhaji) also was brought up by Jijabai with her son Shivaji after Santaji's martyrdom at the Battle of Pavan Khind with Baji Prabhu Deshpande  Early career  At an early age, Dhanaji joined Maratha army under Shivaji's Military Chief Prataprao Gujar. In the battles at Umbrani and Nesari, Dhanaji's performance attracted attention of Shivaji for the first time. He was named by Shivaji on his death bed among six pillars of Maratha Empire who would save the kingdom in hard times. They would end up with success in the 27 Years War between Mughal forces of Aurangzeb and the Maratha forces. Later career and death In November 1703, Aurangzeb opened talks with Dhanaji through his son Kambaksh to handover Shahu to him. The talks, however, could not succeed due to the so-called extravagant demands by Dhanaji made on behalf of the Maratha king. In 1705, Maratha army containing about 40,000 soldiers headed by Dhanaji, Dado Malhar and Rambhaji Nimbalkar smashed into Surat and looted entire region of Gujarat up to Bharuch. Dhanaji also vanquished the Mughal army under Nazar Ali, the Nawab of Baroda, at Ratanpur and brought huge treasure to Maharashtra. In 1708, with mediation by his assistant Balaji Vishwanath, who would later become Peshwa in 1713, Dhanaji left Tarabai and joined hands with Shahu at Khed.

Hiffernan is the subject of this portrait. Joanna Hiffernan (1843 - after 1903) or Joanna Heffernan was an Irish artists' model and muse who was romantically linked with American painter James Abbott McNeill Whistler and French painter Gustave Courbet. In addition to being an artists' model, Hiffernan herself also drew and painted, although it is not believed she ever exhibited her work. Early life Hiffernan was a Roman Catholic who was probably born in Ireland in 1843. She and her family may have left Ireland for London during the Great Famine of 1845 to 1848, taking up residence at 69 Newman Street. The spelling errors in her surviving letters reveal she received a modest education.Jill Berk Jiminez (ed)Dictionary of Artists' Models, Routledge (2001) - Google Books pgs. 275-278 Her father, Patrick Hiffernan, was described by Whistler's friends, Joseph Pennell and his wife Elizabeth, as being like \\"Captain Costigan,\\" the drunken Irishman in Thackeray's novel Pendennis. The Pennells also described him as \\"a teacher of polite chirography (calligraphy)\\" who used to speak of Whistler as \\"me son-in-law.\\"Pennell, Elizabeth Robins, and Joseph Pennell, The Life of James McNeill Whistler, 2 vols, London and Philadelphia, (1908) Her mother, Katherine Hiffernan, died in 1862, aged 44. Joanna Hiffernan had a sister called Bridget Agnes Hiffernan, later Singleton. The artist Walter Greaves, who began tuition with Whistler in 1863, and who knew Hiffernan well,Short biography of Walter Greaves said that she had a son called Harry but no trace of him can be found in official records. She dressed strikingly at Whistler's expense, with George du Maurier scornfully commenting that \\"Jo came with [Whistler] to me... got up like a duchess, without crinoline - the mere making up of her bonnet by Madame somebody or other in Paris had cost 50 fr.\\" Artist's model Gustave Courbet, La belle Irlandaise (Portrait of Jo) 1865‚Äì1866, Metropolitan Museum of Art, a painting of Joanna Hiffernan Whistler first met the 17-year-old Jo Hiffernan in 1860 while she was at a studio in Rathbone Place,Ionides, Luke, 'Memories', Paris, 1925 and in about 1861 began a 6-year relationship with her, during which period she modelled for some of his most famous paintings. Physically striking, Hiffernan's personality was even more impressive. Whistler's biographers and friends, the Pennells, wrote of her, > She was not only beautiful. She was intelligent, she was sympathetic. She > gave Whistler the constant companionship he could not do without.Elizabeth > Robins and Joseph Pennell, The Whistler Journal (Lippincott, Philadelphia, > 1921), p. 121. Whistler's family did not approve of Hiffernan. Unmarried artists' models, and especially those who posed nude, were considered at that time to be little better than prostitutes. However, Hiffernan seems only to have modeled for friends, so perhaps the objections to her made by Whistler's family were based more on social class than on Hifferman's personal character.The Victorian Nude: Sexuality, Morality, and Art by Alison Smith Published by Manchester University Press, 1996 pg 29 When Whistler's mother visited from America in 1864, alternative accommodation had to be found for Hiffernan, who also seems to have been the cause of Whistler's quarrel with Alphonse Legros in 1863.'The Correspondence of James McNeill Whistler' University of Glasgow Whistler Archive She was in France with Whistler during the summer of 1861, and while in Paris during the winter of 1861‚Äì62 she sat for Symphony in White, No. I: The White Girl at a studio in Boulevard des Batignolles and in 1864‚Äì65 she posed for Symphony in White, No. 2: The Little White Girl. It is possible that this is when she met Whistler's friend and fellow artist, Gustave Courbet, for whom she later modeled. There is some thought that she was the model for Courbet's L'Origine du monde, which depicts a nude woman's vulva. Gustave Courbet, Le Sommeil (Sleep), 1866, Petit Palais, Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de la Ville de Paris Hiffernan attended s√©ances with Whistler at Dante Gabriel Rossetti's house in Chelsea in 1863, and spent the summer and autumn of 1865 in Trouville with Whistler. In 1866 Whistler gave Hiffernan power of attorneyTranscript of the 'Power of Attorney' document ‚Äì The Correspondence of James McNeill Whistler ‚Äì University of Glasgow over his affairs while he was in Valparaiso for seven months, making provision for household expenses and giving her the authority to act as an agent in the sale of his works. She called herself Mrs. Abbot, especially when selling Whistler‚Äôs works around art dealers to raise money. During Whistler's absence, Hiffernan travelled to Paris and posed for Courbet in The Sleepers, or Le Sommeil, which depicts two naked women in bed asleep. It is likely that she had an affair with Courbet at this time. After the end of his relationship with Hiffernan, Whistler left a will in her favour. Later years 1881 Census sheet showing Hiffernan living at 2 Thistle Grove Lane After she and Whistler parted, Hiffernan helped to raise Whistler's son, Charles James Whistler Hanson (1870‚Äì1935),Patricia de Montfort, \\"White Muslin: Joanna Hiffernan and the 1860s,\\" in Whistler, Women, and Fashion (Frick Collection, New York, in association with Yale University Press, New Haven, 2003), p. 79. the result of an affair with a parlour maid, Louisa Fanny Hanson. He lived with Hiffernan at 5 Thistle Grove as late as 1880 when Whistler was away in Venice with Maud Franklin, his then mistress. The 1881 English census recorded Hiffernan, her sister Bridget Agnes Hiffernan (1845-1921) and Charles Hanson as visitors of accountant Charles Singleton (whom Bridget would marry in 1901) at 2 Thistle Grove.1881 Census of England, Public Records Office Little is known of Hiffernan after 1880. A woman reported to Juliette Courbet (1831‚Äì1915), the sister of Gustave Courbet, in a letter of 18 December 1882, that \\"the beautiful Irish girl\\" was in Nice, where she sold antiques and some pictures by Courbet. It is said that Hiffernan married a man named Abbot some time after 1881, possibly on the Continent, but this may be an misunderstanding due to Hiffernan calling herself 'Mrs. Abbot' while selling Whistler's paintings to art dealers to raise funds during their relationship. The art collector Charles Lang Freer met Hiffernan when he was a pallbearer at Whistler's funeral in 1903 when she came forward in heavy mourning to pay her last respects.'Pretty women: Charles Lang Freer and the ideal of feminine beauty'.'Magazine Antiques' November 2006 by Susan A. Hobbs His fellow art patron Louisine Havemeyer (1855‚Äì1929) later recorded the incident as she heard it from Freer: > \\"As she raised her veil and I saw ... the thick wavy hair, although it was > streaked with grey, I knew at once it was Johanna, the Johanna of Etretat, > 'la belle Irlandaise' that Courbet had painted with her wonderful hair and a > mirror in her hand.... She stood for a long time beside the coffin‚Äînearly an > hour I should think.... I could not help being touched by the feeling she > showed toward her old friend. \\"Did Maud [Franklin] come?\\" [Havemeyer] asked. > \\"Yes\\" answered Mr. Freer, \\"the same afternoon. She had come all the way from > Paris and was very much affected as I uncovered Whistler's face for her to > see him.\\" ...

Built in 1881 and enlarged in 1888, it is a prominent early example of the work of local architect George P. B. Alderman, and is representative of development patterns in the city that served its growing French Canadian immigrant community. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The Clovis Robert Block is located in the urban South Holyoke area of the city, at the junction of Main and Cabot Streets. It is four stories in height, its exterior finished in red brick and cast stone. A projecting cornice with brackets and modillion blocks extends across the top of its street-facing facades. The ground floor houses five retail spaces, those facing Main Street, with recessed entrances. Bands of brick corbelling separate the floors, and the Main Street facade has a central bowed copper-clad section four bays wide, with a gable at the top. Most windows outside that section are simple sash, set in segmented-arch openings with keystoned and shouldered lintels. The interior, which originally housed fifteen residential units on the upper floors, has been extensively altered, although interior stairwells retain some of their original finishes. The building was built in 1881 for Clovis Robert, an expatriate French Canadian, and expanded in 1888, both to an early design of Holyoke architect George P. B. Alderman. It was built during a period of major migration by French Canadians to the area, seeking work in the local mills. Robert was a prominent local developer and real estate agent for the Holyoke and Westfield Railroad, with this described as his best-known development. He sold the building 1907. It has since had a succession of owners, and was in poor condition when listed on the National Register in 2002. It has since been rehabilitated.

It is based in the parish of Caherline/Caherconlish in the east division of Limerick GAA. History The club was founded in 1884, making it one of the oldest clubs in county Limerick. The early years of the club were its most successful, winning the Limerick Senior Hurling Championship on three occasions; 1896, 1905 and 1907. Caherline also lost four county finals in this period; 1889, 1898 (when a lack of crowd control caused the match to be abandoned), 1908 and 1916. By the 1920s Caherline had slipped back to the junior ranks but returned to the limelight in 1927 when winning their first Limerick Junior Hurling Championship by beating Kilmallock in the county final. This was followed by a second junior title in 1931, when once again Kilmallock were beaten in the final. The club went through lean times after this and were not to appear in another county final until 1974 when Glenroe were the victors in the county junior hurling final. Defeat was to be Caherline's lot once again in the 2001 county junior hurling final, losing out to Newcastlewest. These heartbreaking defeats were consigned to history however, when in 2007 Caherline bridged a 76-year gap and claimed their third junior hurling championship title defeating Effin in the county final. In 2008 the club played in the Limerick Intermediate Hurling Championship for the first time and exceeded expectations by reaching the county final. However Bruff were to be the victors on this occasion, winning on a scoreline of 3-14 to 0-15 in Ballyagran on October 12, 2008. The club's stay at intermediate level ended in 2015 when they were beaten by Claughaun in the relegation playoff. Caherline played junior hurling in 2016 for the first time in nine years. Caherline enjoyed a long season in their return to the Limerick Junior A hurling championship in 2016. Following a competitive East Championship, the club were crowned East Junior A hurling Champions for the first time since 2007 with a 14 points to 11 win over Ballybricken-Bohermore. Had someone told you that Caherline would go on to compete in a further 4 championship matches that year, one may have believed Caherline were destined for county honours. However, despite disposing of Castletown-Ballyagran with ease in the county quarter finals, the club eventually lost out after a trilogy of games against St. Patrick's in the semi finals. These games had everything; last gasp equalisers, extra time, abandonments, red cards over-turned, hard-fought comebacks. Eventually, Caherline lost out AET in the second replay on a 1-23 to 3-14 scoreline on October 22, 2016.

The five story building was built in 1897, and first occupied by the McIntosh Corporation, a major area shoe manufacturer. McIntosh occupied the premises until 1913, when it moved into a new building at Chestnut and Worthington. The next major tenant was Fred Smith, who moved his recreation center business there. Fred Smith began his billiard and bowling business on an adjacente block in 1903. He acquired a number of billiard tables from the 1904 St. Louis Exposition, and installed them on the second floor of this building. On the upper floors he installed a bowling alley, with seven lanes of candlepins on each of the third and fourth floors, and eight on the fifth. The lanes were removed due to declining popularity and moved to a bowling alley in Connecticut. The pool hall is still in business. The building is five story brick construction. The ground floor has glass storefronts. The second floor facade is shown as a mezzanine level, with five windows separated by brick piers. The upper three floor fronts are divided into five bays, each with two windows, separated by piers and topped by a decorative arch. The facade is topped by a corbelled cornice and pierced parapet.

It is one of the oldest houses in Agawam. The house is situated on of land about west of the Connecticut River, at the foot of Provin Mountain. It is a vernacular 1.5 story house with plain Georgian styling. The main block of the house is three bays wide, with a gambrel roof and a central chimney. A 1.5 story addition on the western side of the house as a gabled roof. The main block's foundation is fieldstone, while that of the addition is brick and concrete block. Inside the house, the main block follows a fairly standard Georgian four-room plan. A vestibule with a dogleg stair separates a hall and a parlor in the front, and the rear is divided asymmetrically into a large kitchen space and a small bedroom. Fireplaces open from the central chimney onto the hall, parlor and kitchen. The kitchen fireplace is particularly deep, and includes a bake oven (now coated with a layer of concrete) at its rear, rather than a more typical placement on the side. The upstairs of the main block is divided into four bedrooms, all with very basic finishing work. The exterior walls and ceilings are plastered, while the interior walls which separate them are either plastered or of simple wood construction. The addition, built c. 1930s, is accessed from the small bedroom space, and includes a kitchen space that dates roughly to the period of its construction. The kitchen is at the level of the main part of the house, but a doorway leads to stairs going up and down to rooms in the rest of the addition, which were laid out to provide a separate living space. The construction date of the house is uncertain, and is believed to have been sometime before 1758, when a deed mentions the home of one George Mixer on this parcel of land. The purchaser of the land, Thomas Smith, was a carpenter and housewright, and may have been this house's builder. Tree ring dating places some of the house's structural elements somewhat later, circa 1790. The house was built using a plank framing method that is distinctive to the Connecticut River valley. The property remained in the Smith family until 1843. It was owned by the Park family until 1910, and then went through a succession of owners before its acquisition by the Agawam Historical Society in 2002. The house remained without modern amenities until the 1950s. It is now operated by the historical society as a house museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

Columbus Avenue in Springfield, Massachusetts. Built in 1929-30, it is a prominent local example of civic Classical Revival architecture, designed by well-known local architects. After serving as a county courthouse until the 1970s, it was adapted by the city to house additional municipal offices. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The former Springfield District Court building is located in downtown Springfield, just west of the Municipal Group of institutional buildings where City Hall is located. It faces east onto East Columbus Avenue, which separates it from that cluster of buildings. It is a two-story structure, built out of steel and concrete faced in limestone, with Classical Revival styling. Its main facade is nine bays wide, with the center three projecting slightly and housing the main entrance area. The entrances are recessed behind two massive columns placed in antis within the recess, and the opening is flanked by pilasters. The outer bays of the facade have large multi-section windows, separated between floors by decorative metal panels. The building was constructed beginning in 1929 to replace the previous police court, which was outgrowing its quarters. The new building served as a district court facility, housing a diversity of court needs for Springfield and surrounding communities. It was connected to other facilities by a tunnel (through which female prisoners were transported) and by a bridge called the \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" because it was where male prisoners were transported. It continued in that use until the 1970s, when a new courthouse was built at Court Square. It was then turned over to the city, which has used it for municipal offices since.

The film is a continuation of Robert Louis Stevenson's original classic 1886 novella Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Jack Pollexfen, the scriptwriter of this film, wrote and produced a sequel in the same vein, The Daughter of Dr. Jekyll (1957), starring Gloria Talbott. Plot The film begins with a prologue set in 1860, where Mr. Hyde is chased down in the streets of London, after murdering his wife at their Soho flat. He escapes to the house of Dr. Jekyll, where he prepares the potion that will transform him back to the respected doctor. Unfortunately, the mob has already set the house ablaze. The flames drive Hyde to the top floor, and in an attempt to leap to the ground, he meets his demise when he falls to the ground. As he dies, he changes back to Dr. Jekyll. John Utterson and Dr. Lanyon (original characters from Stevenson's novel) mourn their unfortunate friend Dr. Jekyll, until Inspector Stoddard brings the two to the Soho flat, where Jekyll/Hyde has left an orphan behind. Utterson agrees to adopt the young Jekyll, since he and his wife haven't succeeded in having children. Thirty years later, Edward Jekyll, now fianc√© to Utterson's niece Lynn and a student of Royal Academy of Sciences, is expelled from the academy because of his peculiar and unorthodox experiments. Edward is unaware that he is actually Henry Jekyll's son, and when he inherits the Jekyll Mansion, Dr. Lanyon tells him his tragic father's story. Edward and Lynn move to the old Jekyll Mansion for the preparations of their marriage, and soon, Edward feels unwelcome by his neighbors. Discovering his father's laboratory, Edward convinces himself to work on his father's experiments in order to clear the Jekyll name. He hires Michaels, Dr. Jekyll's old assistant, and begins researching. Unfortunately, after Edward first tests the formula on himself, a Hyde-like man appears in the house and murders a number of people. Edward is charged for the murders, and thought insane, is transferred to Dr. Lanyon's sanitarium where the murders continue. Edward begins wondering if it is he who transforms into a murderer or someone else is trying to drive him to insanity. It was shown clearly that Lanyon changed chemicals and his father's notebook to frame him and keep control of his estate.

A higher coefficient of lift is produced as a result of angle of attack and speed, so by deploying slats an aircraft can fly at slower speeds, or take off and land in shorter distances. They are usually used while landing or performing maneuvers which take the aircraft close to the stall, but are usually retracted in normal flight to minimize drag. They decrease stall speed. Slats are one of several high-lift devices used on airliners, such as flap systems running along the trailing edge of the wing. The position of the leading-edge slats on an airliner (Airbus A310-300). In this picture, the slats are drooped. Note also the extended trailing-edge flaps. Slats on the leading edge of an Airbus A318 of Air France Automatic slats of a Messerschmitt Bf 109 The wing of a landing Airbus A319-100. The slats at the leading edge and the flaps at the trailing edge are extended. The Fieseler Fi 156 Storch had permanently extended slots on its leading edges (fixed slats). Types Types include: ;Automatic: The spring-loaded slat lies flush with the wing leading edge, held in place by the force of the air acting on them. As the aircraft slows down, the aerodynamic force is reduced and the springs extend the slats. Sometimes referred to as Handley-Page slats. ;Fixed: The slat is permanently extended. This is sometimes used on specialist low-speed aircraft (these are referred to as slots) or when simplicity takes precedence over speed. ;Powered: The slat extension can be controlled by the pilot. This is commonly used on airliners. Operation The chord of the slat is typically only a few percent of the wing chord. The slats may extend over the outer third of the wing, or they may cover the entire leading edge. Many early aerodynamicists, including Ludwig Prandtl, believed that slats work by inducing a high energy stream to the flow of the main airfoil, thus re- energizing its boundary layer and delaying stall.Theory of wing sections, Abbott and Doenhoff, Dover Publications In reality, the slat does not give the air in the slot high velocity (it actually reduces its velocity) and also it cannot be called high-energy air since all the air outside the actual boundary layers has the same total heat. The actual effects of the slat are:High-Lift Aerodynamics, A.M.O. Smith, Journal of Aircraft, 1975High-Lift Aerodynamics, by A. M. O. Smith, McDonnell Douglas Corporation, Long Beach, June 1975 ;The slat effect: The velocities at the leading edge of the downstream element (main airfoil) are reduced due to the circulation of the upstream element (slat) thus reducing the pressure peaks of the downstream element. ;The circulation effect: The circulation of the downstream element increases the circulation of the upstream element thus improving its aerodynamic performance. ;The dumping effect: The discharge velocity at the trailing edge of the slat is increased due to the circulation of the main airfoil thus alleviating separation problems or increasing lift. ;Off the surface pressure recovery: The deceleration of the slat wake occurs in an efficient manner, out of contact with a wall. ;Fresh boundary layer effect: Each new element starts out with a fresh boundary layer at its leading edge. Thin boundary layers can withstand stronger adverse gradients than thick ones. The slat has a counterpart found in the wings of some birds, the alula, a feather or group of feathers which the bird can extend under control of its \\"thumb\\". History A319 slats during and after landing Slats were first developed by Gustav Lachmann in 1918. The stall-related crash in August 1917 of a Rumpler C aeroplane prompted Lachmann to develop the idea and a small wooden model was built in 1917 in Cologne. In Germany in 1918 Lachmann presented a patent for leading-edge slats. However, the German patent office at first rejected it as the office did not believe the possibility of postponing the stall by dividing the wing. Independently of Lachmann, Handley Page Ltd in Great Britain also developed the slotted wing as a way to postpone the stall by delaying separation of the flow from the upper surface of the wing at high angles of attack, and applied for a patent in 1919; to avoid a patent challenge, they reached an ownership agreement with Lachmann. That year an Airco DH.9 was fitted with slats and test flown. Later, an Airco DH.9A was modified as a monoplane with a large wing fitted with full-span leading edge slats and trailing-edge ailerons (i.e. what would later be called trailing-edge flaps) that could be deployed in conjunction with the leading-edge slats to test improved low-speed performance. This was later known as the Handley Page H.P.20F. Handley Page \\"Developments In Aircraft Design By The Use Of Slotted Wings\\" Flight, December 22nd 1921, photo page 845 of converted D.H.4 for testing of slotted wings Several years later, having subsequently taken employment at the Handley-Page aircraft company, Lachmann was responsible for a number of aircraft designs, including the Handley Page Hampden. Licensing the design became one of the company's major sources of income in the 1920s. The original designs were in the form of a fixed slot near the leading edge of the wing, a design that was used on a number of STOL aircraft. During World War II, German aircraft commonly fitted a more advanced version of the slat that reduced drag by being pushed back flush against the leading edge of the wing by air pressure, popping out when the angle of attack increased to a critical angle. Notable slats of that time belonged to the German Fieseler Fi 156 Storch. These were similar in design to retractable slats, but were fixed and non-retractable. This design feature allowed the aircraft to take-off into a light wind in less than 45 m (150 ft), and land in 18 m (60 ft). Aircraft designed by the Messerschmitt company employed automatic, spring-loaded leading-edge slats as a general rule, except for the Alexander Lippisch- designed Messerschmitt Me 163B Komet rocket fighter, which instead used fixed slots built integrally with, and just behind, the wing panel's outer leading edges. Post-World War II, slats have also been used on larger aircraft and generally operated by hydraulics or electricity. Research Several technology research and development efforts exist to integrate the functions of flight control systems such as ailerons, elevators, elevons, flaps, and flaperons into wings to perform the aerodynamic purpose with the advantages of less: mass, cost, drag, inertia (for faster, stronger control response), complexity (mechanically simpler, fewer moving parts or surfaces, less maintenance), and radar cross-section for stealth. These may be used in many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and 6th generation fighter aircraft. One promising approach that could rival slats are flexible wings. In flexible wings, much or all of a wing surface can change shape in flight to deflect air flow. The X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing is a NASA effort. The adaptive compliant wing is a military and commercial effort.

Built in 1933, it is a prominent local example of Art Deco architecture, including many well- preserved interior features. Closed by the Trust Company successor Fleet Bank, it was donated to The Community Music School of Springfield. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Description and history The former Springfield Safe Deposit and Trust Company is located in downtown Springfield, occupying a parcel that fronts on State Street between Willow and Main Streets, which extends all the way back to Stockbridge Street. The building is four stories in height, with a steel frame finished in a combination of stone, concrete, and brick. The front facade is faced in limestone, and rises well above the rest of the building, giving it a monumental appearance on State Street. The main feature of the facade is a central arch, which houses the main entrance and windows above. The building corners are adorned with figures near the top of the facade. The main entrance now provides access only to the upper floors of the building, while the building's principal occupant, the Community Music School, uses a side entrance. The interior retains many original finishes and features, including bank vaults, marble floors, limestone walls, and a mural of the George Washington Bridge in the main lobby. The lobby also boasts stonework depicting symbols of thrift and prudence from the animal world. The Springfield Safe Deposit and Trust Company was founded in 1886, originally occupying premises on Main Street. Experiencing rapid growth, it moved in 1908 to the newly built Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company building at State and Main. By 1930 it had once again outgrown its space, and the present building was constructed in 1933 to make a permanent home. The bank directors deliberately chose to hire many local workmen for its construction, which took place at the height of the Great Depression. The building was designed by Thomas James of Boston, who was by then well known for many bank commissions. The bank was eventually acquired by Fleet Bank through a series of corporate mergers and acquisitions, and the building was closed in the 1990s. The bank donated the building to the Community Music School in 1996.

Bull also represented England at table tennis, winning a number of World Table Tennis Championships medals between 1928 and 1932. Cricket career After having made a number of appearances for Kent's Second XI in the late 1920s, Bull made his first-class cricket debut against Surrey in July 1929; he scored 23 in his only innings and sent down three overs for 19. He played a further two first-class games that season, and another one in 1930, but had little success and left the county at the end of the season. Bull's Worcestershire debut came against the New Zealanders in May 1931, when opening the batting he scored just 8 and 6, but his career for his new county truly began in 1933. In that year he made 25 appearances, scoring 743 runs at 21.85, though his highest score was only 79. The four seasons from 1934 to 1937 were the best years of Bull's career. He passed a thousand runs in each season, making five centuries, the highest of these being the first: 161 against Glamorgan in June 1934. His most productive summer was that of 1937, when he hit 1,619 runs including two centuries, this being the only season of his career in which he reached three figures more than once. Bull played 15 times in 1938, but passed 50 only three times and scored under 500 runs in the season. In late May 1939, during the weekend of the match against Essex at Chelmsford, he was killed in a car accident which also left his team-mate Syd Buller injured. Table Tennis career Bull spent his winters playing table tennis and was one of the top players in England. He represented England several times in the World Table Tennis Championships. In the 1928 Stockholm World Championship, he was one of the three teenagers in the English team with Fred Perry and Adrian Haydon. The England team pulled off a sensation defeating the World Champions Hungary 7-2 in the league. In his three matches, Bull defeated the defending champion Roland Jacobi, and Zolt√°n Mechlovits and Laszlo Bellak who would play the singles final in 1928. In the three-way play-off to decide the medals, England lost to Austria and Hungary after Fred Perry twisted his ankle. Bull again defeated Mechlovits but lost to Bellak.Swaythling Cup team resultsVictor Barna, England Players Can Beat the Continental, Table Tennis, 1951 Bull won a silver in 1931, and another bronze in 1929 with the England team.WTTC results With Perry, Bull won a silver in men's doubles in 1928. Perry would go on to win three Wimbledon tennis singles titles in the 1930s. Bull also won bronzes in 1928 and 1932 for mixed doubles and men's doubles respectively. The Prague tournament of 1932 was the last time he represented England in table tennis. As professional cricketer, Bull paid his own expenses to take part in the table tennis World Championships. When some countries protested against a professional sportsman taking part in the game, the International Table Tennis Federation responded by removing the distinction between amateurs and professionals, one of the first sports federations to do so. Death Bull was killed on the night of Sunday, 28 May 1939, when the car he was passenger in rammed into the rear of a stationary lorry. Bull was playing in the Worcestershire-Essex county match at the time, but Sunday was a rest day. He had spent the day playing golf and was returning to the hotel with four fellow players. William Joseph Bone, the driver, was blinded by the light of a car travelling in the opposite direction. The lorry had its rear light damaged. Its driver, Hyman Bunner, was underneath the lorry repairing it when the car hit it at around 45 miles per hour. Both drivers were exonerated of any blame.

These theories explain how linguistic utterances are shaped, based on the goals and knowledge of natural language users. In doing so, it contrasts with Chomskyan transformational grammar. Functional discourse grammar has been developed as a successor to functional grammar, attempting to be more psychologically and pragmatically adequate than functional grammar. The top-level unit of analysis in functional discourse grammar is the discourse move, not the sentence or the clause. This is a principle that sets functional discourse grammar apart from many other linguistic theories, including its predecessor functional grammar.  History  Functional grammar (FG) is a model of grammar motivated by functions. The model was originally developed by Simon C. Dik at the University of Amsterdam in the 1970s, and has undergone several revisions since then. The latest standard version under the original name is laid out in the 1997 edition, published shortly after Dik's death. The latest version features the expansion of the model with a pragmatic/interpersonal module by Kees Hengeveld and Lachlan Mackenzie. This has led to a renaming of the theory to functional discourse grammar. This type of grammar is quite distinct from systemic functional grammar as developed by Michael Halliday and many other linguists since the 1970s. The notion of \\"function\\" in FG generalizes the standard distinction of grammatical functions such as subject and object. Constituents (parts of speech) of a linguistic utterance are assigned three types or levels of functions: #Semantic function (Agent, Patient, Recipient, etc.), describing the role of participants in states of affairs or actions expressed #Syntactic functions (Subject and Object), defining different perspectives in the presentation of a linguistic expression #Pragmatic functions (Theme and Tail, Topic and Focus), defining the informational status of constituents, determined by the pragmatic context of the verbal interaction  Principles of functional discourse grammar  There are a number of principles that guide the analysis of natural language utterances according to functional discourse grammar. Functional discourse grammar explains the phonology, morphosyntax, pragmatics and semantics in one linguistic theory. According to functional discourse grammar, linguistic utterances are built top-down in this order by deciding upon: # The pragmatic aspects of the utterance # The semantic aspects of the utterance # The morphosyntactic aspects of the utterance # The phonological aspects of the utterance According to functional discourse grammar, four components are involved in building up an utterance: * The conceptual component, which is where the communicative intention that drives the utterance construction arises * The grammatical component, where the utterance is formulated and encoded according to the communicative intention * The contextual component, which contains all elements that can be referred to in the history of the discourse or in the environment * The output component, which realizes the utterance as sound, writing, or signing The grammatical component consists of four levels: * The interpersonal level, which accounts for the pragmatics * The representational level, which accounts for the semantics * The morphosyntactic level, which accounts for the syntax and morphology * The phonological level, which accounts for the phonology of the utterance  Example  This example analyzes the utterance \\"I can't find the red pan. It is not in its usual place.\\" according to functional discourse grammar at the interpersonal level. At the interpersonal level, this utterance is one discourse move, which consists of two discourse acts, one corresponding to \\"I can't find the red pan.\\" and another corresponding to \\"It is not in its usual place.\\" * The first discourse act consists of: ** A declarative illocutionary force ** A speaker, denoted by the word \\"I\\" ** An addressee ** A communicated content, which consists of: *** A referential subact corresponding to \\"I\\" *** An ascriptive subact corresponding to \\"find\\", which has the function Focus *** A referential subact corresponding to \\"the red pan\\", which contains two ascriptive subacts corresponding to \\"red\\" and \\"pan\\", and which has the function Topic * The second discourse act consists of: ** A declarative illocutionary force ** A speaker ** An addressee ** A communicated content, which consists of: *** A referential subact corresponding to \\"it\\", which has the function Topic *** An ascriptive subact corresponding to \\"in its usual place\\", which has the function Focus **** Within this subact there is a referential subact corresponding to \\"its usual place\\", which consists of: ***** A referential subact corresponding to \\"its\\" ***** An ascriptive subact corresponding to \\"usual\\" ***** An ascriptive subact corresponding to \\"place\\" Similar analysis, decomposing the utterance into progressively smaller units, is possible at the other levels of the grammatical component.

This demand for manpower also drew in a huge amount of Chinese people coming to South America for work, which explains the huge increase of Chinese people 1950s-1960s.

The inside face of the arch is decorated with rosettes, and the spandrels are filled by Classical carvings executed by John Evans. The entrance is topped by a bracketed cornice that is surmounted by a cartouche with flanking baskets. The Union Trust Company was founded in 1906 by the merger of three city banks, including its oldest, the Springfield Bank (founded 1814). This building served as the headquarters of that bank and its successors until 1970.

The building, which was designed by American architect H. H. Richardson, opened in June 1884 to consolidate two separate stations nearby. The grounds of the station were originally designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. It is located at the junction of the Boston and Albany Railroad (later part of the New York Central Railroad, and now the CSX Boston Subdivision), the New London Northern Railroad (later the Central Vermont Railway, now the New England Central Railroad), and the Ware River Railroad (later under the New York Central, and now operated by the Massachusetts Central Railroad). History=Three railroads The Western Railroad opened from Worcester to Springfield, Massachusetts in 1839, and on to Albany, New York in 1841. In 1867, it joined with the Boston and Worcester Railroad to form the Boston and Albany Railroad. The B&A; had a station, similar in design to the extant station at West Brookfield, located on the north side of its tracks near the modern station site. The New London, Willimantic, and Palmer Railroad opened to Palmer in September 1850. It was extended to Amherst in May 1853 by the NLW&P-leased; Amherst and Belchertown Railroad. After several reorganizations, they were combined as the New London Northern Railroad in 1864, which itself was leased by the Vermont Central Railroad in 1871 then the Central Vermont Railway in 1873. The NLN station was located on the southwestern side of its tracks, opposite the modern station location. The Ware River Railroad opened from Palmer to Gilbertville in 1870; it was operated by the New London Northern (with which it shared a right of way north of Palmer) in 1871 and the Vermont Central Railroad until April 1873 when it was bought by the B&A.; The line was completed to Winchendon that November. Union Station An early postcard of Union Station In August 1881, the B&A; and the NLN hired architect H. H. Richardson to design a union station for both railroads to use. The design was complicated by the narrow angle at which the railroads intersected. W.N. Flynt & Company started work in May 1883 and the station opened in June 1884. It was built of granite from Flynt's quarry (which had its own branch off the NLN in Monson) and trimmed with brownstone from Longmeadow. The station, including a small baggage room which is no longer extant, cost $53,616. Its grounds were designed by Frederick Law Olmsted; little of this landscaping remains. End of passenger service The Central Vermont became part of the Grand Trunk Railway in 1899, which in turn was nationalized by the Canadian government in 1922. Passenger service on the line ended on September 27, 1947. A mixed train was operated on the Ware River until 1948. The B&A; was acquired by the New York Central Railroad in 1900. Local service was operated until April 24, 1960, after which only Palmer, Springfield, Pittsfield, and Albany remained stops west of Worcester. A single round trip continued to serve Palmer under the NYC and Penn Central until April 30, 1971; Amtrak declined to continue the route when it took over operations the next day. Amtrak Bay State, Inland Route, Montrealer (train), Vermonter, and Lake Shore Limited service since then have not stopped at Palmer. Revival The three lines continue to see freight service. The Central Vermont was sold to RailTex in 1995 and operated as the New England Central Railroad. RailTex was merged into RailAmerica in 2000, which in turn was acquired by the Genesee & Wyoming company in 2012. The B&A; is now the CSX Boston Subdivision, while parts of the Ware River railroad are operated by the Massachusetts Central Railroad. The station building housed a flea market for many years, and a section of canopy was removed in the 1980s. It was bought by new private owners in 1987, and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. The freight house was torn down by Conrail in 1989. The Steaming Tender Restaurant, which caters to railfans observing busy CSX traffic, opened in 2004. Restored rail service to Palmer has been proposed. The Central Corridor Rail Line would run on the NECR, while increased Boston- Springfield frequencies on CSX have been proposed by the state.

They are recognised as a subspecies of Liasis olivaceus, separating the population from the olive python found to the east. It is a large snake, most often around 2.5 metres in length, although individuals may attain a larger size. The python is an ambush predator, using a sit and wait method at a path or beneath the water to capture a variety of animals that inhabit the arid surroundings. The range of prey includes amphibians, birds and other reptiles, and mammals as large as a rock wallaby. Taxonomy The subspecies was first described by Laurie A. Smith by examining nine specimens, separated from a total of 36 nominally allied as the Liasis olivaceus species group held in the collection of the Western Australian Museum. The original description, published in 1981, contained typographic errors in the specimen's registration numbers and the omission of a ninth specimen included in Smith's review; examination of the paratype material in 2015 was able to reallocate the correct details. The specimens were acquired over many years and considered by the author to be relatively rare. The holotype was collected W. H. Butler at Tambrey Station in Western Australia in 1964. The earliest record of the subspecies is probably the report of Ernest Giles at the Ashburton River in May, 1876. Common names for the taxon include the Pilbara olive python and olive python (Pilbara subspecies). The epithet barroni honours the contributions of Gregory Barron to herpetology. The indigenous peoples of the northwest of Australia have incorporated the subspecies into creation stories, where it is named as Bargumyji (Yindjibarndi) and Parkanurra or Palkunyji (Kurrama). Description Adults grow larger than the nominate subspecies, L. olivaceus olivaceus, and are distinguished by a lower midbody dorsal scale count (58-66) and a higher number of ventral scales (374 to 410). The average length is around 2.5 metres, but are recorded as up to 4 metres. The scales are smooth, excepting the anterior scales at the edge of the mouth which are pitted. The coloration is variable, as a uniform olive-green, dull in tone, to a shade of pale fawn, or else bicoloured with a cream to white ventrum and dark brown colour above. An ambush predator, the python possesses an array of sensory apparatus that can detect prey as it approaches. Like some other nocturnal animals, the iris is a slit that is increases the ability to see at night. A series of pits at the front of the head are sensitive to the infra- red spectrum, revealing animals moving within range by the warmth of their bodies, along with the ability to detect vibrations with their own bodies. The tongue and Jacobson's organ work in combination to sample the air for the scent of prey, also contributing to the image of the python's surroundings and the animals within it. A typical ambush position includes bodies of water, such as billabongs, where it will submerge itself almost completely. The tail is used to anchor its body, which is in a coiled posture, and the head held in an s-shape above the water. This python is also found waiting at the trails used by rock wallabies. The first record from the Giles expedition gave measurements of the \\"perfect monster for Australia\\" as nine feet in length, one foot in circumference, and a weight of fifty pounds. An eleven foot specimen was noticed by the ornithologist F. Lawson Whitlock while conducting field research in the Hamersley Range, mistaking the body submerged in water for a discarded wheel, the same author reported in 1923 that others in the region were up to 5.5 metres in length. Dom Serventy produced a survey in 1952 of the rock pythons in the Pilbara that gave the largest known size as 3.7 metres, a specimen collected at Hooley that weighed 9.3 kilograms. Behaviour The species was assumed to inhabit sites with permanent water, where many observations had been made, although the use of implanted radio transmitters revealed a more complex range of environments and the ability to traverse difficult terrain. The breeding season occurs in the cooler part of the year, around June to August, initiated by the scent trail left by the female. Mating has not been observed, apparently taking place during a period of several weeks while a pair take residence at the breeding site; they are presumed to copulate many times during this period. Males leave before the eggs are laid and tended by the female, around October, at the two sites surveyed this was a cave beneath rock slabs that were distant from any water source. Brood size and success rate of births has not been determined. The young emerge in January, slender in form with a head that is notably bulbous, and begin to disperse to the surrounding area in search of refuge and food. Encounters with people have sometimes been fatal for this python, although local interest and legal protection has reduced some threats to the population. In the early twentieth century, one very large specimen provided to the state museum was killed by the resident, Olive Cusack, when it entered her Tambrey property where a puppy was located; Whitlock shot an individual to stop it discouraging the bowerbirds he was observing from revisiting the site. Threats to the population included incidents on roads, accidents are that made more frequent by the python's response, remaining completely still, when it senses the vibrations of oncoming vehicles. They are also deliberately struck by vehicle drivers who mistake the animal for a species of large and poisonous brown snake. The python is also known to cohabit with people at tolerant households, a group reported at Red Hill Station resides there without apparent concern for the human presence. These animals are observed at the camping grounds of the region's National Parks, where the snakes have been seen‚Äîperhaps drawn by the small of mice‚Äîattempting to consume a raincoat and tent bag. The juveniles are drawn to aviaries of Pilbara residents, especially canaries and budgerigars, a specialist service provides relocation of these pythons. Distribution and habitat The distribution range of this python is restricted to the Pilbara and northern Gascoyne, arid bioregions in the northwest of Australia. The type locality given is \\"Tambrey, Western Australia, in 21¬∞35S, 117¬∞34E\\". The records of its occurrence includes the Burrup Peninsula, Karijini and Robe River, and the subspecies also occurs at offshore islands. They are widespread within this range, and results of surveys indicate that it is represented by sometimes large local populations at suitable habitat. Surveys at Burrup, Tom Price and Millstream-Chichester National Park have been conducted, including the use of radio transmitters to study individuals over several years, which have resulted in a better understanding of the python's individual range and habits. They are usually observed or tracked moving slowly when travelling, or laying in ambush awaiting prey, however, they may occupy a number of sites in a large territory. The males can travel several kilometres when seeking a female in the breeding season. The preferred habitat is often associated with open water, such as swamps and rock pools, not for the need to drink but for the attraction of those prey animals who do. Typical habitat is found along the Fortescue River, which only runs during periods of flooding and supports a local fauna of frogs, mammals and birds. Prey species that have been observed include a range of birds, corellas, ducks and pigeons, the mammals able to be captured include young euros or rock wallabies and it is known to reside at fruit bat colonies. Smaller sized individuals are presumed to subsist on prey such as frogs and reptiles. The python may traverse difficult terrain to relocate to hunt or find refuge, the environment is often rocky hills, escarpments and plains dominated by dense vegetation such grassy mounds of Triodia in spinifex country. They have been observed at artificially created habitat, such as railways and residences, or drawn to the lakes and sewerage ponds associated with settlements and mining operations in the northwest region. Conservation The Pilbara olive python is protected under the Wildlife Conservation Act (1950) of Western Australia. It is listed on the Wildlife Conservation (Specially Protected Fauna) Notice 2010(2), in Schedule 1, as a species that is rare or is likely to become extinct. It is also listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999).

The growth of this village contributed to the decision in the 19th century to separate the more rural area of North Andover from the town. It is centered on a stretch of the Shawsheen River between North Main Street on the east and Moraine Street on the west. Most of the district's properties lie on Stevens Street, Red Spring Road, Shawsheen Road, and Essex Street, with a few properties also located on adjacent roads. Although no buildings remain from Andover's earliest industrial enterprises in the area, there are still some mill buildings that date as far back as to the 1820s in the old Marland Mill complex on Stevens Street. The most prominent building in this complex, however, is a spinning and carding mill that was built in 1885, and features a five-story tower and ornate brick detailing. One of the older buildings in the district was the Abbot Mills complex, with history dating to 1814. Located at 18-20 Red Spring Road, it was a 3.5 story wood frame barn-like structure. It was next door to the mills of Smith & Dove, which are of stone construction dating to the 1820s. The other major industrial component of the district is the Tyer Rubber complex on Railroad Street, whose main building dates to 1912. The barn-like structure of the Abbot Mills complex suffered a fire in 2013 and was demolished in 2014. Much of the wood in the building was salvaged and recycled. There is a significant variety in the types of housing related to the mills. Much of the early housing has Greek Revival styling, although there are a few houses that show more Federal style detailing. Later housing includes boarding houses, tenements, and other multiunit buildings in a diversity of styles. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

Developed between 1865 and 1925, it was one of the state's largest textile operations at its height. At the time of its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985, the mill complex was owned by Malden Mills. Description and history Arlington Mills in 1907 The Arlington Mills occupy of land straddling the boundary between Lawrence and Methuen. It is bounded on the east by Broadway, a historic post road, and on the west by the Spicket River, which originally supplied it with power. The complex has 23 buildings, most of which are of brick construction. The largest is the 1896 wool-combing mill, which is long, while the 1906 worsted weaving mill is long. The first industrial use of this site was about 1820, when Abiel Stevens built a wood- frame factory in which piano cases were built. Stevens' first mill burned in 1855, and he rebuilt the following year. The Arlington Mills Company began operation in 1865, after purchasing this location; its investors were owners of Lawrence's other mill operations. In 1880 their 1865 building was demolished and replaced by a new brick structure, now termed the worsted-weave shed which is one of the surviving buildings. The complex grew over the years, and was by 1925 one of the largest textile factories in the state. During World War I it supplied large quantities of flannel and wool shirting to the United States Army.

Pakistan's climate is a continental type of climate, characterized by extreme variations in temperature, both seasonally and daily, because it is located on a great landmass north of the Tropic of Cancer (between latitudes 25¬∞ and 36¬∞ N). Very high altitudes modify the climate in the cold, snow-covered northern mountains; temperatures on the Balochistan plateau are somewhat higher. Along the coastal strip, the climate is modified by sea breeze. In the rest of the country, temperatures reach great heights in the summer; the mean temperature during June is in the plains, the highest temperatures can exceed . During summer, hot winds called Loo blow across the plains during the day. Trees shed their leaves to avoid loss of moisture. Pakistan recorded one of the highest temperatures in the world, 53.7 ¬∞C (128.66 ¬∞F) on 28 May 2017, the hottest temperature ever recorded in Pakistan and also the second hottest measured temperature ever recorded in Asia. The dry, hot weather is broken occasionally by dust storms and thunderstorms that temporarily lower the temperature. Evenings are cool; the daily variation in temperature may be as much as 11¬∞C to 17¬∞C. Winters are cold, with minimum mean temperatures in Punjab of about in January, and sub-zero temperatures in the far north and Balochistan.  Climate geography  Estimation of regions where snow regularly falls The monsoon and the Western Disturbance are the two main factors which alter the weather over Pakistan; Continental air prevails for rest of the year. Following are the main factors that influence the weather over Pakistan. *Western Disturbances mostly occur during the winter months and cause light to moderate showers in southern parts of the country while moderate to heavy showers with heavy snowfall in the northern parts of the country. These westerly waves are robbed of most of the moisture by the time they reach Pakistan. *Fog occurs during the winter season and remains for weeks in upper Sindh, central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab. *Southwest Monsoon occurs in summer from the month of June till September in almost whole Pakistan excluding western Balochistan, FATA, Chitral and Gilgit‚ÄìBaltistan. Monsoon rains bring much awaited relief from the scorching summer heat. These monsoon rains are quite heavy by nature and can cause significant flooding, even severe flooding if they interact with westerly waves in the upper parts of the country. *Tropical Storms usually form during the summer months from late April till June and then from late September till November. They affect the coastal localities of the country. *Dust storms occur during summer months with peak in May and June, They are locally known as Andhi. These dust storms are quite violent. Dust storms during the early summer indicate the arrival of the monsoons while dust storms in the autumn indicate the arrival of winter. *Heat waves occur during May and June, especially in southern Punjab, central Balochistan and Sindh. *Thunderstorms most commonly occur in northern Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Azad Kashmir. *Continental air prevails during the period when there is no precipitation in the country. Pakistan has four seasons: a cool, dry winter from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through May; the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June through September; and the retreating monsoon period of October and November. The onset and duration of these seasons vary somewhat according to location. The climate in the capital city of Islamabad varies from an average daily low of 2 ¬∞C in January to an average daily high of 38 ¬∞C in June. Half of the annual rainfall occurs in July and August, averaging about 255 millimeters in each of those two months. The remainder of the year has significantly less rain, amounting to about fifty millimeters per month. Hailstorms are common in the spring. Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, which is also the country's industrial center, is more humid than Islamabad but gets less rain. Only July and August average more than twenty-five millimeters of rain in the Karachi area; the remaining months are exceedingly dry. The temperature is also more uniform in Karachi than in Islamabad, ranging from an average daily low of 13 ¬∞C during winter evenings to an average daily high of 34 ¬∞C on summer days. Although the summer temperatures do not get as high as those in Punjab, the high humidity causes the residents a great deal of discomfort. In Islamabad, there are cold winds from the north of Pakistan. Extreme weather events=Highest temperature and rainfall ever recorded The weather extremes in Pakistan include high and low temperatures, heavy rainfall and flooding. The highest temperature ever recorded in Pakistan is 53.7 ¬∞C (128.66 ¬∞F), in Turbat, Balochistan on 28 May 2017. It was not only the hottest temperature ever recorded in Pakistan but also the second verified hottest temperature ever recorded in Asia and the fourth highest temperature ever recorded on earth. The highest rainfall of was recorded in Islamabad during 24 hours on 24 July 2001. The record-breaking rain fell in just 10 hours. It was the heaviest rainfall in Islamabad in the previous 100 years. Tropical cyclones and tornadoes Each year before the onset of monsoon that is 15 April to 15 July and also after its withdrawal that is 15 September to 15 December, there is always a distinct possibility of the cyclonic storm to develop in the north Arabian Sea. Cyclones form in the Arabian sea often results in strong winds and heavy rainfall in Pakistan's coastal areas. However tornadoes mostly occur during spring season that is March and April usually when a Western Disturbance starts effecting the northern parts of the country. It is also speculated that cycles of tornado years may be correlated to the periods of reduced tropical cyclone activity. Drought The drought has become a frequent phenomenon in the country. Already, the massive droughts of 1998-2002 has stretched the coping abilities of the existing systems to the limit and it has barely been able to check the situation from becoming a catastrophe. The drought of 1998-2002 is considered the worst drought in 50 years. According to the Economic Survey of Pakistan, the drought was one of the most significant factors responsible for the less than anticipated growth performance. The survey terms it as the worst drought in the history of the country. According to the government, 40 percent of the country's water needs went unmet. Floods Pakistan has seen many floods, the worst and most destructive is the recent 2010 Pakistan floods, other floods which caused destruction in the history of Pakistan, include the flood of 1950, which killed 2910 people; on 1 July 1977 heavy rains and flooding in Karachi, killed 248 people, according to Pakistan meteorological department of rain fell in 24 hours. In 1992 flooding during Monsoon season killed 1,834 people across the country, in 1993 flooding during Monsoon rains killed 3,084 people, in 2003 Sindh province was badly affected due to monsoon rains causing damages in billions, killed 178 people, while in 2007 Cyclone Yemyin submerged lower part of Balochistan Province in sea water killing 380 people. Before that it killed 213 people in Karachi on its way to Balochistan. =2010 Floods= 2010 July floods swept 20% of Pakistan's land, the flood is the result of unprecedented Monsoon rains which lasted from 28 July to 31 July 2010. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and North eastern Punjab were badly affected during the monsoon rains when dams, rivers and lakes overflowed. By mid-August, according to the governmental Federal Flood Commission (FFC), the floods had caused the deaths of at least 1,540 people, while 2,088 people had received injuries, 557,226 houses had been destroyed, and over 6 million people had been displaced. One month later, the data had been updated to reveal 1,781 deaths, 2,966 people with injuries, and more than 1.89 million homes destroyed. The flood affected more than 20 million people exceeding the combined total of individuals affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2005 Kashmir earthquake and the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The flood is considered as worst in Pakistan's history affecting people of all four provinces and Gilgit‚ÄìBaltistan and Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. =2011 Sindh floods= The 2011 Sindh floods began during the monsoon season in mid-August 2011, resulting from heavy monsoon rains in Sindh, Eastern Balochistan, and Southern Punjab. The floods have caused considerable damage; an estimated 270 civilians have been killed, with 5.3 million people and 1.2 million homes affected. Sindh is a fertile region and often called the \\"breadbasket\\" of the country; the damage and toll of the floods on the local agrarian economy is said to be extensive. At least 1.7 million acres of arable land has been inundated as a result of the flooding. The flooding has been described as the worst since the 2010 Pakistan floods, which devastated the entire country. Unprecedented torrential monsoon rains caused severe flooding in 16 districts of Sindh province.

The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The city of Beverly is located on the North Shore of Massachusetts, just northeast of Salem, from which it is separated by the Danvers River. The city at first grew up around its waterfront on the river, but its present commercial business center took shape in the 19th century, with the arrival of the railroad (in 1839), and the subsequent development of a major shoe industry. Its downtown area is mostly reflective of late 19th and early 20th century commercial development, although significant reminders of its maritime past survive as well. The historic district is centered on a stretch of Cabot Street, extending north from Central Street to a central junction with Federal and Church Streets. It then runs along Church Street to Dane Street, where Beverly Common extends along Dane Street all the way to Hale. The district includes properties on some adjacent side streets. There are more than 100 historically significant buildings, including the city's major municipal buildings and churches, as well as a significant amount of commercial property. Prominent buildings include Beverly City Hall, the 1781 Federal style mansion of one of the city's early important merchants, Andrew Cabot, and the John Cabot House, built by Andrew's brother, which now serves as the headquarters of the Beverly Historical Society. The Odd Fellows' Hall, located opposite city hall, is a high-style Late Gothic commercial block.

Most are Christian and are the descendants of economic migrants from Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon, who arrived in Chile in the mid-19th to early-20th centuries. Christians in the Middle East are ethnic groups, mainly Arabs, with other ethnic groups like an Aramean minority in the Levant and Iraq, Armenian refugees in the Levant and Copts in Egypt. Ethnically Arab Chileans are often called \\"Turks\\", (Spanish: Turcos) a term derive from the fact that they arrived from the Ottoman Turkish Empire.Arab and Jewish immigrants in Latin America: images and realities, by Ignacio Klich, Jeff Lesser, 1998, p. 165.

And the effects of their migration are widely visible. The earliest such migrants came in the 1850s, with others arriving during World War I and later the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The Club Palestino is one of the most prestigious social clubs in Santiago. They are believed to form the largest Palestinian community outside of the Arab world.Un chileno \\"da la pelea por Palestina.\\" Aside from these migrants of previous decades, Chile has also taken in some Palestinian refugees in later years, as in April 2008 when they received 117 from the Al-Waleed refugee camp on the Syria-Iraq border near the Al-Tanf crossing. The situation in Gaza has led to increased hostility toward Jews in Chile. Historically, the Arabs of Chile were called Turks, Moors, Arabs, Lebanese, or Palestinians.So far from Allah, so close to Mexico: Middle Eastern immigrants in modern Mexico, Theresa Alfaro-Velcamp, University of Texas Press, 2007, p. 14.

It is a cathedral of the Church of Antioch with six parishes.Antiochian Orthodox of Santiago to Chile.  History  The first Arabs in Chile first registered in a census carried out dates back to 1895, however, in 1854 and 1885 are some subjects of the Ottoman Empire, which could well be in Lebanon, Palestine or Syria, which were part of the Empire at the time. The majority of Palestinians arrived in the early 20th century, fleeing the Ottoman Empire due primarily to professing the Christian religion, oppressive rule and then the economic situation and the outbreak of the First World War. Note that the Ottoman Turkish oppression (Sunnis) was reflected not only in the Christian minority in Syria, Palestine and Lebanon, but against Shiite Muslims who arrived in the entire Atlantic coast to be the majority in the region, and some spent via Argentina to Chile in the early 20th century located across the country bringing to their culture and work to the development of Chile. On arrival, the Arabs were devoted to work primarily in the commercial sector. The Palestinian community, despite their cultural differences with Chilean society, managed to permeate an important part of the country's middle class, although some of its members have some of the greatest wealth of the country. Although the District Board, in Santiago and the city of La Calera were the main locations where they lived and traded for many years, in recent times they have moved over the city of Santiago de Chile, Las Condes, Providence, √ëu√±oa and Recoleta. The large influx Arab party began in 1860 and extends until 1900. It is estimated that the Arabs who came to America reached at one million people. Until 1918 the Palestinians migrated with Turkish passports. The output ports were Beirut, Haifa and Alexandria, and the journey was made via Genoa and Marseille. The large concentrations of immigrants were Syrians, Palestinians, Lebanese and their descendants in Brazil, Argentina and Chile. It is estimated that there are 25 million people of Arab descent in Latin America. By 1940, the Arab Guide de Chile estimated at 13,466 the number of Arabs in Chile. 61% of the Arabs in Chile are people who arrived (or whose descendants arrived) between 1900 and 1930. Over 60% of Arabs who came were between 10 and 30 years old. In 1912, the Muerched, the first Chilean newspaper written in Arabic, began publication. It is estimated that there were at least 12 similar publications during the 40 years of immigration. In addition to the strong influence and varied diversity in areas of national affairs, a fact which demonstrates the presence of the Arab population in Chile, is the call for at least 7 players who were Chilean-born Palestinians (as Roberto Bishara) in the Palestinian football team during the Asian qualifiers for the FIFA World Cup 2006. Economic influence in Chile It is the case of the Banna family: Carlos, Jorge and Amador. His father, Juan, emigrated in 1894 from Bethlehem and was a good move. He died in 1954, when Cotton Manufacturers lived its golden age: the company, founded in 1936 with his brothers Nicol√°s and Saba, it produced 60% of cotton yarn and fabrics in Chile. Its partners were the Said-Isa and his six children, among them Salvador, the father of Jos√©, now a member of the Parque Arauco shopping mall- amusement park and BHIF. Today is the fourth financial institution, with 11% of loans and returns on equity of 24%, and among the 20 largest banks in the region. In 2003 the Bank acquired Conosur at about U.S. $100 million. Jos√© Said Saffie (age 72) multiplied the family fortune and is among the most affluent persons in Chile and Latin America, as owner of 21% of Parque Arauco, 16% BHIF Bank-BBVA, which concentrates 7% of loans, 25% of Andina Bottling, 30% of Factorline, factoring the fourth largest in the country, 48% of Edelpa, the largest flexible packaging and 50% of Cl√≠nica Re√±aca. In the area of the mall has invested in Argentina, where Parque Arauco owns 27% of Alto Palermo, a company that manages eight shopping centers, including Patio Bullrich and unique Market Hall. Apart from the groups spearheading the cousins Jos√© Said Saffie, Jaime Said Demaria and his uncle, Domingo Said Kattan, there is another branch that descends from the businessman born in Bethlehem Issa Said Sahuire: that of Antonio Said Kattan, brother of Domingo. This is the only one still remains in the textile sector. At 92 years, heads Fibratex Textiles Manufacturing. It also has real estate investment and action by the Electronic Stock Exchange. A group met in 1986 under the name of the Ten Mosques, whose history dates back to 1986.

The economic boom enjoyed by Chilean society was formed by Arab Investment, a financial firm where the individual contribution was U.S. $1 million. Saieh took over as manager. Two years later, he merged the Bank of Labor, making it the third of the square. In the early 1990s formed subgroups to start new businesses. First was the purchase of AFP Provida, in 1993 - six years later sold to BBVA for U.S. $260 billion, where through participating INECSA Saieh only, the Diaz family, Fernando Aguad the Abumohor and Rishmague Odde.

But they accepted the offer of Banco Santander: nearly $500 million by the Osorno. At that time Juan Guti√©rrez left the group. Khamis and later emigrated Kauak. Consolidated acquired in Venezuela and in Argentina the Buci, who later disposed of. Here AFP acquired the Union and Financial Protection and Condell. In 1997, seeking to give a new image and profile, the Concepci√≥n was renamed Infisa Corpbanca and became the holding Corpgroup. Saieh, Abumohor, Rishmague D√≠az Cumsille, Selum and remain in Corpgroup Aguad. The bag placed in holding 24.9% of Corpbanca in November 2002 and exactly one year later topped the 23% that belonged to foreign funds Blackstone Group, JP Morgan Partners and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, in addition to ADR Wall Street, to provide more liquidity to the action. This institution is the fifth of the financial system in loans, with 3.8%. But everyone has done their part. Rishmague in 2002 consolidated his emerging regional financial holding company UCB, UCB umbrella of Financial Services, Factoring UCB, Union Credit Bank in Miami, and a significant share of Chile Corpbanca, Corpbanca Venezuela. Its assets exceed $100 million. Also betting on the U.S. market, and its partners Saieh √Ålvaro Jorge Selum, Fernando and Alberto Aguad Muchnick - through Corpgroup Financial Services, concluded an agreement in November 2002 to buy First Western Bank of Florida, allegedly close in December. The aim is to use that entity - with assets of U.S. $30 million as a platform for Latin America and complement Corpgroup operations, where 51% Saieh handles.

There is evidence from an 1874 map that he may have begun development as early as 1874, even though he did not have permission to erect permanent structures on the land then. This development grew, and a significant number of modest cottage-style houses were built between then and the early 20th century.

History = Immigration  Along with the British, Americans came to Chile to develop the country's economy and trade from the early 19th century onwards. Even though very few compared to the British, they did contribute to Chile's wealth and economic development well into the 20th century. Other English speaking immigrants included Irish, New Zealanders and Australians. Valpara√≠so was on the route from Britain to California, which the United States won from Mexico in 1845. That same port was even the scene of one of the battles of the Anglo- American War of 1812. One American who was in Chile was Wheelwright, who introduced the railway in Chile and nearby Argentina in the 1850s. In the California Gold Rush, a massive influx of Chilean miners went to California and many had returned to Chile wealthier than before. To Chileans, Americans, almost all of British ancestry at the time, were so similar to the British that they were both lumped together as gringos, a term still used for Americans. Nowadays, most Chileans are much familiar with American culture than British culture, due to Hollywood and popular music. An alleged Cherokee immigration from the United States took place in the late 1800s, but the estimated 100,000‚Äì150,000 Chileans of Cherokee descent isn't officially confirmed. It was thought Joaquin Murieta of 1850s California folklore was of Cherokee-Chilean descent, but more likely, official sources found he's from Sonora, Mexico thus a Mexican came to the state after US annexation in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. The Cherokee, like the German Chilean community, numerous Croatian Chileans, Palestinian Chileans (see Arab Chileans) and Korean Chileans (see Asian Chileans), are thought to contributed to Chilean prosperity. From the United States of America (esp. the state of Utah), Mormons from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints introduced Mormonism into Chile and today, 700,000 (565,000 regular or active) members out of Chile's 18.5 million people are Mormon‚Äî4 percent of the population‚Äîand there's a temple in Chile while a second one was announced for Concepcion. See The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Chile.  Contributions  Americo-Chileans played a role in international diplomacy between the two countries (see United States-Chile relations). The relationship turned tense during the Salvador Allende era (1970‚Äì73), in which the American CIA-backed bloody coup replaced him with general Augusto Pinochet to head a right-wing military regime (1973‚Äì89). Also the American Chilean community were instrumental in reformation of the economy of Chile since the Chicago Boys experiment in American business schools from the late 1950s to early 1990s known as El Milagro Economico (the economic miracle) or Miracle of Chile. Historically, some Chilean immigrants to the United States (see Chilean American) originated from the Central Valley of Chile from the San Antonio, Chile and Los Angeles, Chile areas, usually to California during the gold rush era (1846‚Äì54). Many Chileans prospered there and some were established enough to return home with their new wealth. On August 16, 1906 a major earthquake struck Valpara√≠so with great devastation and thousands of deaths. Chilean doctor Carlos Van Buren, of American descent, was involved in medical care of earthquake victims. He later established a modern hospital Carlos Van Buren Hospital in 1912. American and European medical staffers improved medical care in Chile. Military experts from the United States and Great Britain when the British Empire peaked in the turn of the 20th century, and pre-1914 Prussia (now Germany) developed and modernized the Chilean armed forces (the army, national police, navy and air force).  Demography  Today, American culture is a dominant force in Chilean society, and an increase of North American tourists from the United States and Canada in the 1990s and 2000s attracted to the world-renowned scenery and increasing economic opportunity in Chile.

Multiwinia is available as a standalone game, or included as part of Darwinia+. Plot Multiwinia follows its predecessor Darwinia, in which a computer scientist, Dr Sepulveda, created a digital world that existed within a computer network. This world, Darwinia, was inhabited by a two-dimensional digital life-form called Darwinians and was to become \\"the world's first digital theme park\\". In Darwinia, the player eradicated a computer virus that infected the world and threatened the life of the Darwinians. After this, Dr Sepulveda deemed the world safe again. However, the virus had changed something in the Darwinians, and over time they became more aggressive, dividing into factions and fighting. Now labelled Multiwinians, the tribes continue to fight each other. Gameplay Multiwinia is a real-time strategy game with six different modes. Each mode is designed to support between one and four players (human or CPU) and up to 50 unique maps of varying difficulties. As a multiplayer, and much more processed randomly generated universe version of Darwinia's, it has statistically inspired a random stochastic layered atmosphere. *Domination Each team fights to control the entire map. Teams fight over the spawn points dotted around the map in order to capture them and achieve a dominant position that will enable them to control the entire map. This game mode will continue until one team is victorious, or a timer can be used to limit the game to a set time limit. After that time the team with the most spawn points will win the game. *King of the Hill Two multiwinia tribes battling in the King of the Hill game-mode Occupy key tactical zones around the map to score points. On each map there are a fixed number of Scoring zones - for a standard sized two- player map there are up to four zones. Each team can score points by occupying these zones with Multiwinians - scoring one point per second for every zone under their control. Scoring zones often become areas of heavy fighting, and are frequently occupied by several teams at once, all in intense combat. In this case, the team with the largest share of the zone will be scoring the points, and this is shown by rendering the Scoring zone as a \\"pie chart\\", showing the team colours occupying the zone and their relative percentages. *Capture the Statue Multiwinians must lift the giant stone statues that appear in the Statue Zone, and carry them safely back to their base to score points. Large numbers of Multiwinians are required to lift the heavy statues, and they move very slowly. If the Multiwinians carrying a statue are killed, it is dropped and remains where it is until more Multiwinians pick it up. If it is dropped heavily (e.g. on the edge of a steep hill) the statue shatters, and re-appears randomly in one of the Statue Zones. Each team has a base near their start point, into which they must lift the statue to score a point. The winner is the team that has successfully carried the most number of statues to their base. *Rocket Riot Each team has a giant rocket at their start point, and in order to win they must refuel and occupy the rocket, and perform a successful launch. Each team must complete several stages in order to successfully launch their rocket. First it must be refueled, and then occupied by 100 Multiwinian astronauts. Once occupied a launch countdown begins and upon completion the rocket launches. The team that first launches its rocket wins the game. Fuel for the rocket is generated by several fuel pumps, located around the map. These fuel pumps are the key to winning Rocket Riot - the team must occupy and control the solar panels which work the fuel pumps, in order to divert their fuel into the rocket. At any point during these phases, the rocket is extremely vulnerable to explosions. If the rocket is successfully attacked by an enemy team it will explode, burning all the fuel and all the Multiwinians inside, and resetting the rocket to its starting point. *Blitzkrieg Each team tries to capture the enemy's flag while defending their own. Each team starts with a flag. A number of other flags are spread across the map, and in order to win the game, a team must capture flags which link their own flag to their opponents' flags. When a team loses its flag, it is eliminated from the game - the last team standing (the one which has kept hold of its flag until the end of the game) wins. Each team's flag is well- protected, and each team receives regular reinforcements of Multiwinians throughout the match. *Assault One team must defend a weapon of mass destruction (WMD) that will explode within a defined time period, whilst the other team must attack and destroy the WMD before the time period elapses. Play then switches around and the attacker becomes the defender and vice versa. The winner is the team that successfully attacks in the quickest time. The attacking team receives a constant flow of reinforcements whilst the defending team is heavily armed with turrets, but has a limited force. The attacking team must build up a force and attack in waves to capture machine gun turrets, pillboxes and sabotage the three control stations connected to the bomb. The constant reinforcements provided to the attacking team ensure that eventually they will break through - the challenge is for the defending team to hold off for as long as possible. Reception The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. George Horlor rated the game 10/10 and recommended it, saying ‚Äúone of the best RTS titles out there, you own Steam? You should own Multiwinia‚Äù. Eurogamer called the game \\"a quirky but devilishly compelling distillation of all that strategy games can be\\". IGN cited the crate power ups as the game's \\"most questionable element\\" and stated, \\"while it's still undoubtedly fun as a lightweight experience, it's far from being cerebrally rewarding or especially clever.\\" PC Gamer UK said the game was \\"endearing, yet thin\\".

A synagogue was established in 1763, and Jews visiting the annual Leipzig Fair would lodge in the Br√ºhl and the surrounding streets. The Br√ºhl retained Jewish connections into the 20th century. The street was a centre of the world fur trade. Chaim Eitingon, the Russian-born 'king of the fur trade', opened a branch there in 1893, and in the 1920s the street represented one-third of the world trade in furs.Official Leipzig tourist service web-site > Only 4.2% of Leipzigers as a whole worked in the fur industry, but 8.7% of > Jewish Leipzigers did.

Ironically, Wagner's disciple Theodor Uhlig, in an 1850 essay which Wagner was later to build on for his own essay Das Judenthum in der Musik, condemned the music of Meyerbeer by linking it to the Jewish quarters of Leipzig and Dresden: 'If that is dramatic song, then Gluck, Mozart, Cherubini and Spontini carried out their studies at the Neumarkt in Dresden or the Br√ºhl in Leipzig.'Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik, 23 April 1850, p. 270 Wagner's birthplace was demolished in 1886, three years after his death, and the site was later occupied by a department store, built in 1968 to a design of the architect Harry M√ºller.

Before moving to the Icahn School of Medicine in 2013, he was the founding director of both the Center for Prostate Cancer at Weill Cornell Medical College and the LeFrak Center for Robotic Surgery at NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital. Dr. Tewari was the Ronald P. Lynch endowed Chair of Urologic Oncology and the hospital's Director of Robotic Prostatectomy, treating patients with prostate, urinary bladder and other urological cancers. He is a world leading urological surgeon, and has performed over 9,000 robotically assisted procedures using the da Vinci Surgical System. Academically, he is recognized as a world-renowned expert on urologic oncology with over 250 peer reviewed published papers to his credit; he is on such lists as America's Top Doctors, New York Magazine's Best Doctors, and Who's Who in the World. In 2012, he was given the American Urological Association Gold Cystoscope Award for \\"outstanding contributions to the field of urologic oncology, most notably the treatment of prostate cancer and the development of novel techniques to improve the outcomes of robotic prostatectomy.\\" Robotic prostatectomy With the introduction of the da Vinci Surgical System, the advent of robotic surgery using a laparoscopic approach has significantly changed the way prostate cancer surgery and prostatectomy procedures in general are performed as compared to the traditional 'open' methodology. Much of Tewari's research projects serve to promote robotic surgery as opposed to open procedures. For example, Tewari has shown that the operating field has become more visible to the surgeon, unobscured by the copious amounts of blood encountered in traditional surgery and is thus able to view the urological structures under three-dimensional, enlarged magnification. Patients reap even greater benefits. Due to the minimally invasive nature of the procedure, they experience minimized pain, minimized blood loss, less scarring and fewer complications. Post-surgery recovery is accelerated and patients experience quicker return to urinary continence and sexual function. Some of Tewari's current research is focused on comparing the benefits of robot-assisted surgery with traditional open prostatic surgery. Career On 15 October 2013, Dr. Tewari was named the chairman of urology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Previously he served as Director of the Lefrak Institute of Robotic Surgery, Director of Prostate cancer, as well as the Director of Robotic Prostatectomy and Prostate Cancer- Urologic Oncology Outcomes at the Brady Urology Foundation of Weill Medical College. He is a tenured Professor of Urology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. In addition, Tewari directs a fellowship program in Robotic Prostatectomy and Prostate Cancer Outcomes that has conducted research comparing robotic surgery outcomes versus those of laparoscopic and open surgeries. Tewari is an Attending physician at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Medical degree Receiving his medical degree from Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial Medical College (GSVM) in Kanpur city of Uttar Pradesh, India, Tewari graduated with honors in 1984 with 17 gold academic medals to credit. He received his training in urology from Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) in India under the mentorship of Professor Mahendra Bhandari and completed the McH and DNB program in 1991. Training Tewari has trained in the U.S. at UCSF, University of Florida and at HFHS under Dr. Mani Menon, where was part of the surgical team that performed the first robotic procedure at VUI. Tewari completed his urology residency at the Vattikuti Urology Institute (VUI) of the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, in 2004. He received his urologic oncology research training at the University of California, San Francisco in 1994, the University of Florida in 1998, and VUI in 2004. Research Tewari's research interests revolve around the diagnosis and treatment of patients with urological cancers, with a focus on prostate cancer. His research ranges from the study of patient outcomes, robotic techniques, molecular markers for cancer aggressiveness, racial disparity in cancer biology, quality of life studies, strategies to improve nerve sparing and sexual function recovery, and anatomic studies to facilitate continence preservation to the development of next generation robotic techniques. He has received several federal and non- federal research funding grants for his research on prostate cancer, totaling several million dollars in grant capital. He is one of the few urologists in the world to receive an NIH R01 Grant. Additionally, he is among the first surgeons to use real time tissue imaging during surgery to minimize nerve damage in the patient and was the first surgeon in the world to use the catheter-less Prostate Surgery. The catheter-less surgery minimizes postoperative pain after prostatectomy.

Biography Dillon was born in Tuam, County Galway, Ireland, in 1841, the eldest child of John Dillon and Julia Rigny. He was baptized on 24 April 1841. Dillon received his early education at school in Banagher, County Offaly and then entered the missionary seminary at All Hallows College, Dublin and was ordained priest on 25 October 1863. His education along with five other seminarians was funded by Fr Fahy the Chaplin of Buenos Aires. In 1866, Fr. Dillon went to the Falkland Islands to minister to the approximately 200 Catholics there. In 1871, he succeeded Father Fahy as Irish Chaplain of Buenos Aires. In 1880, Dillon was elected provincial deputy to the Buenos Aires legislature with the sponsorship of the Autonomist Party and in 1883 he was elected national Senator for Buenos Aires. He founded the Irish Catholic Association and the College Saint George in Argentina. The Monsignor Dillon Institute is named in his honor. Fr. Dillon had a conflicting reputation among Irish-Argentines. According to Thomas Murray, Dillon was \\"much more popular with the rich than with the poor among his countrymen, and at that time [1877] there was a very considerable number of the two classes of our people in the Capital. ... The Canon did not measure up to the type of priest to whom the term Sagairt aruin [dear priest] is sincerely applied by the Irish. He was too much in politics for a city Chaplain\\" [Thomas Murray The Story of the Irish in Argentina, 1919, New York: P. J. Kenedy & Sons, page 397]. He returned to Ireland due to ill health and due in some part to the mistakes of the Dresden Affair that involved the organising of mass Irish emigration to Argentina.

This library, as the main branch, is located in downtown Ludington, in Mason County in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The library started as an idea that in 1872 formed an association. A trial for a free reading room was undertaken and later a small building was acquired for a definitive reading room. The town's founding fathers and James Ludington donated money for a new building but it never came to fruition. The temporary library went through a series of changes and relocation proposals; a permanent library was not constructed for about 20 years. A group of women formed the Pere Marquette Literary Club, a social club in the 1890s that ultimately helped in the formation of a permanent city library. They took financial support from Andrew Carnegie to construct the library building and it opened in 1906. The building has since had major expansions and is still operational. The library has metal sculptures at various parts of its surrounding property. The sculptures were made to represent learning and book reading in creative ways. The sculpture placed in the front of the library building is known as \\"Flights of Learning\\", which symbolizes the mission of the library, and the one in the backyard is known as \\"Double the Fun\\" which depicts a teacher reading to her students. Early history The Ludington Public Library started with the Ludington Library Association on April 9, 1872.Cabot, November 9 A meeting was announced for those that were interested in organizing a library. At the time there was interest in a public reading room with an aim to improve mental health. The meeting was held at Ludington Hall over the Pere Marquette Lumber Company \\"Big Store\\" (later bought by Pierce Manufacturing) at the southwest corner of Main Street (now Gaylord Avenue) and Ludington Avenue to establish a permanent organization of a library association. Articles of association were filed on April 12, 1872, and it was brought up at an official city meeting on the evening of April 24, 1872 at the same location.HR Page 1882, section Ludington The organization was perfected and officers were elected in 1872 and 1874. On April 30, 1872 a free reading room opened for a 90-day trial. A few days later, a letter was received from James Ludington of Milwaukee, expressing his interest in the library idea. The letter contained a draft for $100 to be used in the purchase of books. S. F. White visited Milwaukee in June of that year in the interest of the library association and made a purchase of books. Local citizens donated other suitable books. By the spring of 1874 a library of nearly 400 books had been gathered. The library association then occupied a small building that stood just south of the Pere Marquette Lumber Company's \\"Big Store\\" to be used freely by anyone. Annual officers of 1872 * Delos L.

Haight Pere Marquette Lumber store, later Pierce Manufacturing Co. Longfellow School, circa 1909 Soon thereafter various plans were considered for a new location since the volume of books became to large to handle. D.L. Filer, who had been the president of the library, proposed on behalf of the Pere Marquette Lumber Company to donate a site on Ludington Avenue. In this proposal all the lumber necessary for its construction would be provided by Ludington. He was to donate $2500 to the city of Ludington for building the new structure and $1,000 each from D. L. Filer and John Mason Loomis. The new structure was to accommodate the library on the main floor with county offices, a court room, and the city council chambers upstairs. This building with a library, however, was never built since James Ludington didn't come through with his donation because of financial setbacks in Milwaukee. Meanwhile, instead there was a Mason County Courthouse built on Pere Marquette Street to accommodate the city and county offices only. Nothing further was done toward plans for a new library structure and the idea was dropped. The library association subsequently moved in 1876 to the second floor of the Gebhardt Building at the southeast corner of Ludington Avenue and Harrison Street. In 1877, the library moved into the Temperance Hall, at the northeast corner of Ludington Avenue and James Street, after its new construction was completed by the Red Ribbon Club. Between 1877 and 1881 the library association hosted lectures by guests that included Susan B. Anthony, John Bartholomew Gough and Schuyler Colfax. On June 11, 1881, the building and all library contents were destroyed in a major city fire. There was no insurance and about $500 worth of books were lost. An effort was made by Eugene Allen of the executive committee and a few others to reorganize a new library, however nothing serious came of this for over 20 years. The Central School (later Longfellow School) shared their books with the public for many years, however their collection had fewer books. Mid history Interest to rebuild a new Ludington library was kept alive in the 1890s by a group of women that had an organization called the Pere Marquette Literary Club.Cabot, November 16 They first made contact with Andrew Carnegie around 1903 to obtain funds for the construction of a new library. At this time various people offered sites that they would sell for prices ranging from $1,000 to $1,500. Some of these sites were at the corners of Harrison and Loomis as well as Rowe and Court streets and on Ludington Avenue, Emily Street, and Charles Street (now Rath). There was a lot of controversy over the selection of the final library site. Mayor Warren A. Cartier recommended that the matter of \\"petty jealousies\\" be worked out and that deciding on the final site location would be brought up again in a later meeting. The Pere Marquette Literary Club worked on obtaining the grant from the Carnegie Institution for construction of the new Ludington library. Carnegie wrote back a letter saying that as soon as the city council decided on a free site and could guarantee it then funds would be eropriated. On September 6, 1904, the city council had a meeting and voted to close the deal with Charles G. Wing for the lot at the corner of Ludington Avenue and Rowe Street, site of the former newspaper office of the Ludington Appeal. They then proceeded to complete the arrangements with Carnegie for the construction funds of $15,000 for the library.Book 12, Common Council of the City of Ludington, September 7, 1904 Ludington Public library 1906 At a city meeting on February 6, 1905, the city approved the plans for a two-story building that would utilize Carnegie's funds.Ludington Record-Appeal, 2-9-1905, Volume XXXVIII, No. 26 The building was designed by Edward Lippincott Tilton, who was recommended by Carnegie. The building was to have reading rooms, cloak rooms, and a lecture room on the second floor. The Ludington Carnegie library building was declared as the library that will \\"stand a thousand years.\\" The current Ludington Public Library was constructed where the \\"old Appeal building\\" once stood in 1904. The contractor builder John Anderson received the contract to build the new Carnegie library in 1905. His bid of $11,380.33 was the lowest general contractor bid of the six bids received by the city. A local Ludington newspaper then reported the notes of the city council showing that the plans for the new library and its construction had been approved. Ludington Public library, c. 1925 Carnegie distributed over $40 million ($1 billion in 2010) given in grants to United States communities to erect 1,689 libraries. In 1905 Ludington received one of the 53 grants given to Michigan communities from him for construction of libraries. A Carnegie Grant of $15,000.00 and matching funds from the city of Ludington were put forth to build and support the new library that continues to exists. He had a special program that gave grants which covered the cost of the construction of free public access libraries under certain conditions‚Äîthat Carnegie would provide the funds for the erection of the building, which was usually equal to about two dollars per local area resident. The local government had to then provide the construction site and an amount equal to 10 percent of the Carnegie grant annually from the city tax revenues to support the newly funded library. The city of Ludington provided the construction site and agreed to $1,500 annually (10% of the construction cost) for maintenance of the building. On March 1, 1906 the library opened with a collection of 3,800 books. Ludington library ground breaking shovels for Just Imagine project Later history In 1975 a major remodeling and enlargement to the Ludington Public Library was begun. The Mason County voters passed a millage for the construction and additionally Federal revenue-sharing funds were received. Total cost of the new portion was $300,000. The addition was finished and opened to the public in 1976.Cabot, November 23 Since then a group called Friends of the Library has assisted the activities of the library. The Zonta Room, named for the local branch of Zonta International, includes extensive genealogical and historical research materials. The Ludington library celebrated its centennial with a keynote speaker on March 3, 2006. The library had from 2008 an expansion campaign called Just Imagine where it collected funds for adding a construction which was a Children's Library, a large meeting room, and an activities area. The lobby of this addition has an area of personalized brick pavers for those that donated to the library. Brochure obtained at the Ludington Public Library titled \\"Just Image\\" Ludington Library Expansion Campaign 2007-2009 There is a Wall of Recognition at the entrance of donors that contributed to the Vision Campaign, a $1 million project building fund. The expansion was completed in 2010. \\"Flights of Learning\\" of 2012  Flights of Learning sculpture  The 800-pound and seven-and-a-half-foot-tall \\"Flights of Learning\\" sculpture is at the front exterior entrance of the Ludington Public Library. The metal sculpture by Utah artist Bryce Pettit took about six months to complete. It was purchased for the downtown Ludington library by businessman John Wilson and his wife Anita. The sculpture came just after the opening of the new wing in 2012 which was added to the back of the existing library. The new wing was called the Keith Wilson Children's Center and is named after John Wilson's father. The \\"Flights of Learning\\" sculpture was installed on June 29, 2012 at an event attended by a few dozen people. John and Anita Wilson were presented with a scale model of the sculpture they had donated to the library. This sculpture is a continuation of the Mason County Sculpture Trail that started with nine sculptures at Waterfront Park near downtown Ludington, Michigan. The metal sculpture symbolizes the mission of the library. The metal book open at the base of the statue is meant to imply that parents and members of the community shoulder the responsibility to better the world through a child's learning. The open book represents a gateway to learning, while the birds represent the knowledge acquired from the books. The knowledge released through the \\"Flights of Learning\\" signifies an opportunity to achieve \\"new heights of freedom\\". The birds depict different areas of learning and knowledge; the owl represents sciences and mathematics, the falcon represents history, the jay represents literature, the meadowlark represents music, the hummingbird represents fantasy, and the tern represents arts. The artist used his 11-year-old daughter as a model for the metal sculpture.  Double the Fun sculpture  \\"Double the Fun\\" of 2014 The \\"Double the Fun\\" sculpture is a statute in the Mason County Sculpture Trail installed at the Ludington Public Library on August 15, 2014. The statue, constructed by the sculptor W. Stanley Proctor, pays tribute to a high school English teacher Sallie Peterson Ferguson, who was a founder of the Montessori School of Kalamazoo. Dr. Bill Anderson, chair of the Mason County Cultural Economic Development Task Force, suggested the library as a permanent placement location for the sculpture because of Sallie's background in teaching, and it became the second statute placed at the library. It was commissioned by her surviving husband Jon Ferguson, who she was married to for 47 years. It shows her sitting on a bench reading to a young boy and girl, representing her passion for reading. Proctor, the sculptor artisan well known for bronze sculptures, has installed works at private and public places including corporations, libraries and Universities. His sculptures are installed at the Leon County Courthouse, the Florida Governor's Mansion Children's Park, Hackensack University Medical Center, the Living Desert Museum in California, the Boyds Collection in Pennsylvania, the Colorado National Jewish Center Hospital, and the University of Alabama in Huntsville. This was Proctor's third creation that has been placed in Ludington; the other two being at the sculpture park at Waterfront Park in downtown Ludington.

While the group's primary task is the operation of over a hundred dialysis clinics around the nation, DSI is on the forefront of hospital construction technology with operations including the state-of-the-art breast cancer treatment facility in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.  History  DSI was founded in Nashville during 2003. While the group found a rocky start with only five employees in the beginning, over the next few years DSI was able to create a modular design for hospital buildings, reducing the cost and time to create the building while actually improving the quality of the facility. In April 2006, financed by Centre Partners, a leading private equity firm, DSI was able to purchase 105 dialysis clinics and four other programs from Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, inc. The purchase made DSI the third largest dialysis provider at the time. In July of the same year, DSI set its first modular building in Bucks County. The modular units, produced in Conyers, Georgia were shipped to Bucks County and a twelve patient hospital wing was laid out in less than eight hours. This marked a milestone for both DSI and the medical community, showing that quality hospitals could be created in record time. In April 2009, the hospital facility in Bucks County, PA filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7. The bankruptcy was actually filed under \\"Bucks County Oncoplastic Institute.\\"  Technology  DSI pursues and utilizes the best technology the medical industry has to offer. For instance, all files are stored electronically which has improved efficiency and confidentiality while streamlining patient records and treatment. All personnel are trained on the system and capable of easily tracking their patients‚Äô progress and are thus able to treat them more effectively. PEARL DSI and its predecessor were able to create the medical software PEARL, which is used to track patients‚Äô status, ensure that medications and operations are performed in a timely fashion, and allow a streamlined interface between doctors and their staffs. This system is used in all DSI facilities. Modular Construction From the beginning of DSI, modular construction for hospital facilities was envisioned. While many skeptics denied that it was possible, after a rigorous production program, DSI was able to also design their first modular clinic. The facility not only met health department standards but exceeded them in many departments. Combined with the advanced technology and DSI's creative strive, many of the facilities can be considered the highest technology healthcare facilities in the United States. In mid-2006, DSI laid its first modular hospital, including a twelve patient wing, in less than eight hours. Actual time to set the building is around two days. The entire construction cycle, from the time that the building is ordered until the time that the facility receives a certificate of occupancy is barely over four months, compared to the standard six months to a year that it takes to erect a facility using standard construction methods.  Current and future projects  DSI is currently working on an economical pharmaceutical service in which dialysis patients can have their prescriptions sent directly to their clinic through DSI. This means that instead of having to go to a local pharmacy to place and pick up prescription orders, DSI will ensure that all prescriptions arrive on time at the clinic and will eliminate the cost and hassle of going to the pharmacy for the patient. Going along with DSI's desire to be environmentally responsible, DSI set up a research study during the summer of 2008 in order to investigate how the facilities can become more energy efficient and ‚Äúgo green.‚Äù Currently, research into wind turbine and solar photo-voltaic technology is being conducted to improve facilities‚Äô energy efficiency and reduce their global footprint. Likewise, water reclamation technology is being pursued.  References  #\\"DSI Holding Company Inc.

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) was a user of RemoteView software.  Overview  RemoteView is an electronic light table application, initially developed and released commercially by Sensor Systems in 1996. An electronic light table application makes it possible for imagery analysts to review satellite images on a computer instead of examining film or printed photographs. RemoteView was originally written only for the Unix operating system, but as the US Department of Defense transitioned to the Windows operating system, Sensor Systems released a Windows-based version. Overwatch acquired Sensor Systems and the RemoteView software in 2005. Textron Systems acquired Overwatch in 2006. RemoteView's main function is an imagery and geospatial analysis tool. It can display imagery formats, elevation data sets, and vector data sets. Capabilities include image enhancements, photogrammetry, orthorectification, multispectral classification, pan sharpening, change detection, assisted search, location positioning, and 3D terrain visualization. These features allow an intelligence analyst to review large-scale imagery and generate annotated reports on any findings. Extensions Textron Systems Geospatial Solutions offers extensions that add specialized capabilities to RemoteView. These include: * Virtual Mosaic ‚Äì a tool for quickly joining more than four adjacent or overlapping images * 3D Pro ‚Äì a module that expands visualization tools to allow creating 3D virtual worlds for simulating real world conditions and planning missions * RVConnect ‚Äì a tool that enables automatic data sharing between RemoteView and Esri‚Äôs ArcMap software * V-TRAC Basic ‚Äì a complementary video player that allows analysis of full motion video recorded by UAVs * V-TRAC Pro ‚Äì expands the abilities of V-TRAC Basic to include mark-up and reporting tools * GeoCatalog for Desktop ‚Äì a complementary database that makes it easier to organize and retrieve geospatial data See also * Geomatics * Imagery analysis * Remote sensing * Remote sensing application * Satellite imagery ReferencesExternal links * RemoteView Product Page Category:GIS software Category:Remote sensing software ","title":"RemoteView"},{"id":"18733953","text":"Saugeen Tract Agreement, registered as Crown Treaty Number 45, was signed August 9, 1836 between the Saugeen Ojibwa and Ottawa and the government of Upper Canada.

Vuitch, 402 U.S. 62 (1971), was a United States Supreme Court abortion rights case, which held that the District of Columbia's abortion law banning the practice except when necessary for the health or life of the woman was not unconstitutionally vague.. Background Milan Vuitch, an abortion provider in the District of Columbia, had several times come under suit for providing abortion services that the government deemed not necessary for the life or health of the woman, in accordance with the DC law. Vuitch challenged the law as being unconstitutionally vague with regard to the term \\"health.\\" Federal District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell agreed, dismissing Vuitch's indictment and ruling that the law failed to give the sufficient certainty required by due process of law in criminal matters.Greenhouse, Linda. Becoming Justice Blackmun. Times Books. 2005. Page 75. Gesell's finding was the first federal court decision declaring an abortion law unconstitutional. Decision There were two questions before the court: 1. Whether they had jurisdiction to decide the case, and 2. Whether the D.C. law was unconstitutionally vague. On the first question, Justice Black, joined by Burger, Douglas, Stewart, and Byron White, held that they could. On the second question, Harlan and Blackmun, although dissenting in jurisdiction, joined Black on the merits, while Douglas and Stewart joined Brennan and Marshall in dissent. On the merits, Black held that \\"health\\" was not vague, since lower courts had construed it fairly concretely to mean physical as well as psychological health. Although this was the final (as well as the first) abortion case prior to Roe, only Justice Douglas, writing in dissent, suggested the existence of a general right to abortion as part of a broader right to privacy. This view would be embraced by seven Justices in Roe two years later. Significance Vuitch lost in the sense that the statute was ruled not \\"vague\\"; the district court's decision was overturned and Vuitch could be prosecuted.Greenhouse, Linda. Becoming Justice Blackmun. Times Books. 2005. Page 77. However, the decision treated abortion as a surgical option not fundamentally different from any other, and the Court seemed to care most about sufficient leeway being given to a doctor's professional judgement.Greenhouse, Linda. Becoming Justice Blackmun. Times Books. 2005. Page 78. The justices voted to hear Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, other abortion cases, the day after Vuitchs opinion was announced.

The screenplay by Newman and Ronald Buck focuses on the relationship between a blue-collar worker and his son (Robby Benson), who fails at various odd jobs while aspiring to be a writer. Joanne Woodward, Ellen Barkin, Ossie Davis, Wilford Brimley and Judith Ivey also star. The film also features Morgan Freeman in an early role. Plot Widower Harry Keach is a construction worker in Southern Florida who was raised to appreciate the importance of working for a living. He takes a dim view of his sensitive son Howard's lackadaisical and sometimes hedonistic lifestyle, in his early twenties and devoted to a dead-end part-time job, surfing, chasing girls, and hot-tubbing while he dreams of becoming the next Ernest Hemingway. Harry also has a strained relationship with his daughter Nina because he dislikes her husband, an insurance salesman, and he thinks Nina has become stuck up now that she has married a more affluent man. When intense headaches and impaired vision cause Harry to lose control of the wrecking ball on his crane, he loses his job. His unemployment leaves him feeling frustrated, although he refuses to work in his brother Tom's military surplus store. He becomes increasingly angry at Howard for quitting jobs at a car wash and with an auto-repo outfit and threatens to throw his son out of the house. Harry spends some of his free time visiting his widowed neighbor Lilly, a pet store owner who was good friends with his deceased wife, has loved Harry for years. Her daughter Katie, a former high school girlfriend of Howard who he broke up with due to rumors of her being promiscuous, is now pregnant with another man's child. After being abandoned by her lover, Katie's relationship with Howard rekindles. He is resisting the advances of a nymphomaniacal older woman, Sally, but eventually introduces her to Harry. Howard succeeds in selling a short story, much to his father's amazement. He uses some of the money to finance a vacation for Harry, Lilly, Katie and her newborn baby (also called Harry). Harry begins to experience happiness at last, until tragedy strikes.

The movie set construction site was the demolition of the sister hotel affiliated with the Gulf Stream Hotel named The Inn. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 36%, based on 11 reviews, and an average rating of 3.9/10. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film \\"a decently intentioned but rather drab mess of a movie\\" and added, \\"Mr. Newman has done creditable work as a director before . . . but Harry and Son looks like a first effort, partly because the screenplay has no focus and no particular tone of voice . . . Though the characters use a lot of words that are still taboo on television, the entire project feels as small and dated as a Studio One show of the 1950s.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film one star and commented, \\"This movie looks like the aftermath of an explosion in the story department. It's about everything. They give us so many relationships, so many problems, so many emotional hazards, so many colorful characters, we need a battery-lighted ballpoint, so we can take notes in the dark.\\" Although Time Out London felt the film was \\"well acted and elegantly photographed,\\" it thought overall \\"It is nothing more than a constant succession of the kind of emotional peaks actors love to do on screen. Humbler scenes involving background or narrative, which may be immensely tedious to act but help the plot unfold, have in general been left out altogether. The result is a curiously indigestible phenomenon, like being forced to eat five courses of avocado by an overbearing dinner-party host.\\" Awards Robby Benson's performance in the film earned him a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Supporting Actor.

He currently is the public address announcer for the Minnesota Vikings, Colorado Avalanche, and Colorado Rapids. Roach is also the voice of NFL events worldwide, and a public address announcer at 5 Olympic Games. He was the voice of the underground train system in Denver International Airport. His announcing credits include 8 Super Bowls, 5 Olympic gold medal hockey games, and multiple All-Star games for the National Football League, National Hockey League, and Major League Baseball. Career Roach began his radio career as a high school student in Brainerd, Minnesota in 1982. His early radio career included numerous radio stops including Fort Dodge, IA and Des Moines, IA, Garden City, KS, and Colorado Springs, CO. In 1991, Alan landed in Denver, CO as afternoon host on KRFX radio. In 2000, Roach began as morning sports anchor on 850 KOA radio in Denver. In addition to daily sports reports on the station, Roach also served as pre-game host, sideline reporter, and postgame interviewer for the Denver Broncos Radio Network, where KOA was the network's flagship station. He was dismissed from KOA in June 2015. Roach's first sports announcing job was as the public address announcer for the Colorado Springs Sky Sox in 1990. He was asked to fill in for the regular PA announcer during a vacation; the former announcer never got his job back. Since then, Roach has become one of the most heard sports event public address announcers in the world. Roach was hired as the public address announcer for the Colorado Rockies prior to the first game they played as a franchise in 1993. Roach served as PA announcer for every home game in Mile High Stadium and later Coors Field through the 2006 MLB season. Roach missed only one game in 14 years: Saturday, June 9, 2001. Roach began as public address announcer for the Colorado Avalanche with their first game played in Pepsi Center for the 1999-2000 season. On June 9, 2001 Roach missed the Rockies game to announce the historic Stanley Cup Game 7 win over the New Jersey Devils. He announced the post-game ceremony in which Joe Sakic famously handed the Stanley Cup to Ray Bourque. Roach continues as the public address announcer for the Avalanche today. He was also the public address announcer for the Denver Grizzlies' only season in the International Hockey League from 1994-1995 during their Turner Cup-winning season, providing Roach with his first Championship Ring. The Colorado Avalanche hosted the 2001 NHL All-Star game. Roach served as PA announcer for that game and the following NHL All-star games in Sunrise, Florida in 2003 and in St. Paul, Minnesota in 2004. Roach's hockey announcing goes well beyond the NHL. Roach served as English-speaking public address announcer for all men's Olympic hockey games at the E-Center in Salt Lake City, Utah for the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. Roach was at the mic for the historic gold medal win by the Canadians over Team USA on February 24, 2002. Roach also announced hockey in Turin, Italy at the 2006 Winter Olympic Games at Torino Palasport Olimpico. Roach was English announcer during the women's gold medal game won by Canada, 4-1 over Sweden, on February 20, 2006. One day later, Roach was at the mic again for what is widely considered as one of the best hockey games of all time, the 2006 men's gold medal game won by Sweden 3-2 over Finland. 4 years later, Roach was also heard in Canada Hockey Place in Vancouver announcing men's and women's games at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games. Roach announced the Canadian women's gold medal win over Team USA on February 25, 2010. Roach was at the mic one more time in Sochi, Russia for the 2014 Olympic Winter Games hockey match between Team Russia and Team USA when TJ Oshie took the game-winning shot as the Americans beat the Russians on February 15, 2014. Roach also announced the gold medal win by the Canadians over Sweden, and the Swiss women's hockey team's first ever medal, a bronze, on February 22, 2014. Roach handled public address announcing duties for Super Bowls from 2006 - 2013, starting with Super Bowl XL in Detroit through Super Bowl XLVII in New Orleans, Louisiana. Fans did not get to hear Roach's voice during the 2014 Super Bowl, as the NFL cited a potential competitive advantage for the Broncos having their regular P.A. announcer be the announcer at the Super Bowl. The same situation presented itself in 2016, as the Denver Broncos played the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50. As the voice of NFL events, Roach is heard annually at league events like the NFL Draft, Pro Football Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, NFL International Series in London, England, Pro Bowl, and the Super Bowl. Roach resumed PA duties at Super Bowl LI in 2017. In the summer of 2016, after 16 seasons as the stadium voice for the Denver Broncos, Roach left Broncos Country and returned to his childhood home of Minnesota to announce for the Minnesota Vikings as the team moved to their new home, U.S. Bank Stadium, in August 2016. In addition to sports announcing, Roach is also lent his voice for many voice-over projects, none heard more than his voiceover of the underground train system at Denver International Airport, along with local 9News anchor Adele Arakawa. In February 2018, Roach was re-elected to be the male voice for the underground train system at Denver International Airport. Local 9News anchor Kim Christiansen was selected as the female voice to replace her former colleague from 9News, Adele Arakawa. In 2019, he served as the voice of London Stadium for the 2019 MLB London series between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees.

The 72-page book features Superman teaming up with the heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali to defeat an alien invasion of Earth. It was based on an original story by Dennis O'Neil which was adapted by Neal Adams, with pencils by Adams, and figure inks by Dick Giordano with background inks by Terry Austin. Publication history Superman vs. Muhammad Ali was part of DC's oversized series All-New Collectors' Edition, officially numbered #C-56. By the late 1970s, Superman had already been paired in the comics pages with real-life American icons like John F. Kennedy, Steve Allen, Bob Hope, Jerry Lewis, Allen Funt, Don Rickles, and Pat Boone. He had even previously gone up against a real-life athlete, professional wrestler Antonino Rocca.Superman #155, August 1962. The book suffered numerous delays, going from an original publication date of fall 1977 to spring 1978.Kelly, Rob. TreasuryComics.com. Retrieved August 5, 2008. By the time the book was published, Ali was no longer World Heavyweight Champion, having been dethroned by Leon Spinks in February 1978.Marvel Comics took the occasion of Ali no longer being world champion at the time of the book's release to make fun of DC. In The Amazing Spider-Man #186 (Nov. 1978) ‚Äî written by Marv Wolfman, with art by Keith Pollard and Mike Esposito ‚Äî a female representative from a comic book publisher (possibly representing then-DC publisher Jenette Kahn) offers Spider-Man the chance to fight then-heavyweight champion Leon Spinks. Spidey refuses, saying that by the time the book hits the stands, \\"someone else could be champ.\\" (Ali won back the title later that September.) 2010 re-issue In December 2009, DC Comics announced it would publish two hardcover reprint editions of Superman vs. Muhammad Ali in the fall of 2010. One edition reprinted the original story at its original treasury size, while a deluxe edition (featuring a new cover by Neal Adams) included additional content dating back to the original book's publication.Phegley, Kiel (December 23, 2009). \\"Superman & Muhammad Ali Step Back in the Ring\\". CBR.com. Retrieved on January 28, 2010. By 2018, the re-issue has had six printings, and Superman vs. Muhammad Ali has become one of DC's best-selling comics. Plot summary Following a tip-off, Jimmy Olsen leads his friends Clark Kent (secretly Superman) and Lois Lane into a ghetto district of Metropolis for an exclusive interview with Muhammad Ali. They find him playing basketball with the local kids, but before they can ask him even one question, an alien suddenly materializes behind them. This alien behaves arrogantly and rudely, brutally shoving Lois aside, which provokes Ali to retaliate with a boxing strike. Clark, under the pretext of summoning the authorities, runs off, changes into his costume and flies into space, surmising that the alien surely must not have come alone. Indeed, he finds a whole fleet of spaceships in orbit, obviously not on a peaceful errand. The visitor, named Rat'Lar, is the maniacal leader of a species of aliens called the Scrubb. Under the claim that the Earthlings' dishonorable, war-like and aggressive ways poses a potential threat to his people, he demands that Earth's greatest champion fight the greatest Scrubb fighter, the behemoth Hun'Ya. If Earth refuses, the Scrubb and their huge armada of spaceships will destroy it, and to prove his point, he has his fleet fire plasma-composed missiles at St. Louis (which Superman can just barely save) and an uninhabited Pacific island. Superman and Muhammad Ali each come forward to volunteer. However, Ali argues that Superman is not really of Earth, and has an unfair advantage in his many superpowers. In typical Ali-style verbiage, he puts himself forward as the obvious choice. Intrigued, Rat'Lar decides that Superman and Ali should fight one another to see who really is Earth's champion. To make the fight fair, he decrees that the match should take place on his home planet, Bodace, which orbits a red star (which temporarily robs Superman of his powers). The winner would simply be the best boxer. The two would-be champions decide that Ali will train Superman in the finer points of boxing. They journey to Superman's Fortress of Solitude to have his powers temporarily deactivated, and to use a time warping device to extend Rat'Lar's 24-hour deadline into two months, thus giving Superman more time for training. However, Rat'Lar detects the use of this device, and under the threat of Earth's immediate destruction, Superman and Ali are forced to leave the training incomplete. The Superman vs. Muhammad Ali match is broadcast on intergalactic television to thousands of other worlds (with Jimmy Olsen acting as broadcaster). With the match underway, it soon becomes apparent that in battling with more or less equal strength, Ali is the superior fighter. Superman takes a serious pummeling, but somehow refuses to fall down; he stays on his feet all through the beating. Finally, Ali stops the fight, intending to call for a technical knockout, but Superman then falls face-first on the canvas (making the knockout more than technical). Ali personally takes care of Superman and orders him brought back to Earth to recuperate; a move which leaves Hun'Ya pondering. Now crowned Earth's champion, Ali is set to face Hun'Ya, and to everyone's surprise, the goddess Pallas Athena makes an appearance to relay \\"the rules of fair play\\" for this contest into the champions' minds. Rat'Lar then asks Ali to predict at what round the fight will end. (Ali was known for predicting the round in which he would knock out his opponent.) After some chiding, Ali predicts that he will knock the alien out in the fourth round (\\"He'll hit the floor in four!\\"). Once the match begins, however, Ali quickly starts to suffer from fighting the super-powered Hun'Ya. Meanwhile, Superman's great recuperative powers have enabled him to make a speedy recovery. Disguising himself as Ali cornerman Bundini Brown, he steals into the Scrubb command ship and sabotages their space armada. In his showdown with the armada, however, Superman is again badly hurt, and is left drifting in space. Miraculously, Ali gets a second wind. In the predicted fourth round, he not only knocks the alien champion out, but out of the ring as well. Yet after witnessing Superman's decimation of his forces, the Scrubb leader cries foul and decides to destroy the now helpless Earth anyway. Just as Rat'Lar is about to give the go-ahead to his backup forces, his own champion Hun'Ya becomes enraged at Rat'Lar's treachery and deposes him, stopping the annihilation attack. Superman is rescued and once again revived. Hun-ya, the new Scrubb leader, makes peace with Ali, Superman, and all of Earth. The very end of the book shows Ali and Superman in a private moment. Ali reveals that he figured out Superman's secret identity as Clark Kent, but implicitly vows to keep it secret.

DC did not approve of Kubert's likeness of Ali, however, nor the overall grim feeling of the piece, and asked Adams to draw the book instead.

It was written by Garfield's creator Jim Davis as a sequel to Garfield Gets Real. The DVD was released in stores on August 5, 2008. It was followed by a third direct to video film, Garfield's Pet Force, in 2009. Plot Garfield and his friends enter a talent contest, the Fun Fest, but as the audience was not entertained by his performance another cat (with bigger muscles and an accent) arrives to compete against him, Ramone. He and Odie venture into a forest and climb a steep mountain in search of the legendary \\"Funny Water\\", which is supposed to make them more humorous. They gather some of the water and fly back to the studio using a hang glider, only to find that Ramone is dancing with his girlfriend Arlene. Just as Garfield is about to give up, Freddy Frog tells him to search within himself for his own humorous talent, so Garfield beats Ramone and wins the Fun Fest. Ramone is revealed to be a robot controlled by Nermal, as the latter also sought to win the contest's prize.

Sequel Following the success of Fun Fest, a sequel to the film, titled Garfield's Pet Force, was released as a direct-to-video film on DVD and Blu-ray. The film was released on June 16, 2009. It is the final instalment in a trilogy of computer animation Garfield films, including Fun Fest and Garfield Gets Real. Reception=Critical response Review aggregator Metacritic gives the film a score of 44 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \\"generally mixed reviews\\". Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said in his review: \\"Maybe the problem is that Garfield creator Jim Davis, who wrote this movie, can't translate his humor into an 80 minute film. What's funny in a three-panel strip becomes drawn out and forced in a feature-length film. The obvious video-game structuring of the scenes is to be expected, I guess, in these days of rampant, voracious synergy, but that doesn't make the film any more palatable. Maybe somebody else should be brought in to write these straight-to-DVD toons? It doesn't help, either, that the voice work here is somewhat muted. Legendary Frank Welker as Garfield doesn't seem all that inspired this time around (true, he's working with a character who's supposed to be ticked off and monotone, but Welker doesn't seem to find any fun here). And unfortunately, Tim Conway basically phones in his turn as Freddy Frog (even that character's name shows Davis' tired approach to the material - Freddy? Really? That's the funniest or most memorable name you could come up with?). I'm a fan of Conway's, but there's very little here to recommend in his rote performance.\\" Release Garfield's Fun Fest was released on DVD on August 5, 2008, by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.

Cross and memorial plaque on mass grave. 250 Polish victims were buried there until July 17, 1943 The self-defense centres in the Volhynia Voivodship in 1943 Huta Stepa≈Ñska was an ethnic Polish village, located in prewar Kostopol county, Wo≈Çy≈Ñ Voivodeship, in the Second Polish Republic. In 1943, during the Massacres of Poles in Volhynia, it became an important Polish self-defence centre, captured by the UPA between 16 and 18 July 1943. Some 2,000 UIA soldiers, supported by 3,000 local Ukrainian peasants, killed 300 Poles (other sources put number of victims at 600), as they were trying to break out of the encirclement.Tadeusz Piotrowski, Genocide and Rescue in Wolyn, page 51 History The village of Huta Stepa≈Ñska was founded in the end of the 17th century in the scorched areas of the Stepa≈Ñska Wilderness. Its founders were members of the poor Polish noble family of Sawiccy, who had come there from Zhytomyr. In the registry books in the 19th century, the village is called Majdan, and on maps from before World War I, it is called Majdan Huta. The Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland and Other Slavic Countries, issued in 1900 (volume XV, part I), describes the place as follows: ‚ÄúHuta Stepa≈Ñska, a settlement, located 82 versts from Rivne. 71 houses, 208 inhabitants‚Äù. In 1921, when Volhynia was incorporated into the Second Polish Republic, Huta Stepanska was included in the Kostopol county, Volhynian Voivodeship. According to the 1921 Polish census, it had 97 buildings and 539 inhabitants (489 Roman Catholics, 18 Orthodox, 31 Jews and 1 Protestant). In 1922, a Roman Catholic parish was opened there and after 1930 - a health resort, due to rich resources of salt and therapeutic mud, located there. By 1939, Huta Stepanska developed into a major center of northern Volhynia, with more than 200 houses and almost 1000 inhabitants. World War II After combined German and Soviet aggression on Poland, Huta Stepa≈Ñska, together with whole Volhynian Voivodeship, was annexed by the Soviet Union and was incorporated into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Many inhabitants of this area were deported by the NKVD to Siberia, majority of those deported were Poles (see: Forced settlements in the Soviet Union). In the summer of 1941, following Operation Barbarossa, Volhynia, together with Huta Stepanska, were incorporated into the Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Local Ukrainians started to organize themselves in paramilitary units, also first troops of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army began to appear in the area. In late 1942 the UIA started attacking Polish settlements in Volhynia, and in the summer of 1943 the ethnic cleansing became widespread (see: Massacres of Poles in Volhynia). Since Huta Stepa≈Ñska was a large village, surrounded by a Ukrainian majority, numerous Poles, survivors of the early massacres, gathered there. In the first weeks of summer of 1943, Huta Stepa≈Ñska became one of the largest centres of Polish defence, with thousands of refugees living there in appalling conditions. Tadeusz Piotrowski estimates that up to 18,000 people found shelter there.Tadeusz Piotrowski, Genocide and Rescue in Wolyn, page 52 Destruction of the village Establishment of the defence center, which was commanded by Captain W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kocha≈Ñski, aka Bomba (he had been dropped over Poland in late 1942), and in which there also were Jews, serving in Polish unitsHistory of the Jews of Volyhn was soon noticed by the Ukrainians, who decided to destroy it. The attack on Huta Stepanska, preceded by burning fifteen smaller villages in the area, began on July 16, 1943, by troops commanded by Stepan Koval (aka Rubashenko, Burlak), who later said that it was carried out by order of Klym Savur. Koval stated after the war: > In the summer of 1943, following orders of Klym Savur, I carried out > operation of destruction of Polish population in the Rivne district. A UPA > unit under my command destroyed villages of Rafa≈Ç√≥wka and Huta Stepa≈Ñska, > inhabited by the Poles. According to the order of Oleil, commanders of my > battalions - Moroz, Bohdan and Rybak, liquidated Polish colonies and people > there, such as Marian√≥wka, W√≥lka Kotowska - Aleksandria and Zofi√≥wka. We had > two days and we managed to keep the schedule.Tadeusz Piotrowski, Genocide > and Rescue in Wolyn, page 188 Huta Stepa≈Ñska was abandoned and captured by the Ukrainians on July 18, two days after the attack started. Its Polish defenders, realizing that ammunition was in short supply, decided to break out of the encirclement and reach the nearby rail lines. During the evacuation, a panic broke out among Polish civilians, and the Ukrainians took advantage of it, killing from 300 to 600 persons (it is difficult to establish the number of victims). Survivors managed to fight their way through the Ukrainians and reached the railroad junction at the town of Sarny. Most of them were later forcibly taken to Germany, where they had to work for the German war economy as OST-Arbeiters. Today Huta Stepa≈Ñska does not exist any more. All houses inhabited by the Poles were burned to the ground in 1943, and local Ukrainians stole all their possessions, including cattle. What remains is a cross with Polish inscription Jezu ratuj nas (Jesus Save Us, it is a copy of the original, 1943 cross) as well as commemorative stone, placed where once a Roman Catholic church stood, with inscriptions in both Polish and Ukrainian languages.

It is located in Honolulu, Hawaii, within the residential inner-city district of Makiki. Kapiolani Medical Center is Hawaii's only children's hospital with a team of physicians and nurses and specialized technology trained specifically to care for children, from infants to young adults. It is the state's only 24-hour pediatric emergency department, pediatric intensive care unit and adolescent unit. The facility was founded by Queen Kapiolani as the Kapiolani Maternity Home in 1890 for which she held bazaars and luaus to raise $8,000 needed to start the Home. It has since changed its name several times. Kauikeolani Children‚Äôs Hospital opened in 1909 named for Emma Kauike≈çlani Napoleon Mahelona (1862‚Äì1931), the wife of Albert Spencer Wilcox (1844‚Äì1919). In 1978, it merged with Kapiolani Hospital to become Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children. Historical timeline=Kapiolani Hospital * In 1884, Princess Kekaulike died and willed her home, Ululani, as the site of a proposed maternity home to help Hawaiian mothers. * In 1890, after the princess's sister, Queen Kapiolani, raised $8,000 through bazaars and luaus, she founded the Kapiolani Home of the Hooulu and Hoola Lahui Society (society to propagate and perpetuate the race), located at Beretania and Makiki streets, to provide a maternity home for Hawaiian women. The five-bedroom home was opened on June 14, 1890, by King KalƒÅkaua and Queen Kapiolani. Only six babies were born at the home the first year since Native Hawaiian women remained suspicious of doctors and institutions. * In 1917, the society purchased the adjacent August Dreier property southeast of Ululani on Beretania Street. * In 1918, the home moved to a two-story house with 25 beds at 1538 S. Beretania Street, changed its name to the Kapiolani Maternity Home, and opened its doors to women of other than Hawaiian descent. * In 1927, the trustees purchased the property of Dr. John Whitney on the southeast corner of Punahou and Bingham streets to build a new maternity home. * In 1928, groundbreaking ceremonies for the new maternity home were held on June 28. * In 1929, the home moved on March 26 to a new larger building with 50 beds (in twenty-two private rooms, four 2-bedrooms, and two wards) located on the southeast corner of Punahou and Bingham streets and expanded its functions to include non-infectious gynecological problems. The original Whitney home was converted to a nurses' home. * In 1931, its name was changed to the Kapiolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital. * In 1939, after purchasing the adjacent Spalding property south of the hospital on Punahou Street, the Spalding home was converted into a nurses' home named the Kekaulike Nurses' Home. * In 1945, the hospital, at 1611 Bingham Street, finished construction of the two-story Ewa wing that doubled its capacity to 110 beds. * In 1957, the hospital completed a new and enlarged nursery. * In 1961, former President Barack Obama was born in the hospital on August 4. * In 1966, the hospital completed a new four-story Lani Ward Booth wing on Punahou Street, with the top two floors left as shells, capacity remained at 110 beds. * In 1970, the hospital finished the fourth floor of the Lani Booth wing on Punahou Street, capacity increased to 138 beds. * In 1971, its name was changed to Kapiolani Hospital. * In 1974, the hospital began a major rebuilding project, adding an eleven- story hospital and medical office tower on the southeast corner of Punahou and Bingham Streets, a three-story building, and a parking structure for a combined Kapiolani/Children's Medical Center. * In 1976, the new tower was dedicated and Kapiolani patients were moved to its second and fourth floors. * In 1977, a section of the original 1929 building was torn down and tiles from its roof were sold to commemorate the 145,000 babies born under it from 1929 to 1977. Kauikeolani Children's Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Kapiolani Medical Center * In 1908, Albert Spencer Wilcox (1844‚Äì1919) gave $55,000 and other private subscribers gave an additional $50,000 to buy several acres of land and erect a two-story comparatively small, homelike children's hospital (with preference given to Hawaiian children) at 226 N. Kuakini Street, named after Wilcox's wife, Emma Kauikeolani Napoliean Mahelona (1862‚Äì1931). A maternity service was soon after added to the hospital. * In 1929, the maternity service at the hospital was discontinued. * In 1950, a new, modern two-story hospital building with a capacity of 100 beds replaced the original building. * In 1953, the Rehabilitation Center of Hawaii was established by the Kauikeolani Children's Hospital Foundation. * In 1969, the rehabilitation center was renamed the Pacific Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine. * In 1975, the rehabilitation center separated from Kauikeolani Children's Hospital to become the independent Rehabilitation Hospital of the Pacific, which expanded into the 1950 Kauikeolani Children's Hospital building after the latter relocated to Kapiolani/Children's Medical Center on September 15, 1978. Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children * In 1976, Kapiolani Hospital and Kauikenolani Children's Hospital began a protracted, decade-long merger. * In 1978, Kauikeolani Children's Hospital moved into the new eleven-story (226-bed, 108-bassinet) Kapiolani/Children's Medical Center tower located at 1319 Punahou Street on the southeast corner of Punahou and Bingham streets‚Äîinitially with separate entrances for the pediatricians on Bingham Street and the obstetricians on Punahou Street. * In 1984, the medical staff and board of directors of the two former hospitals were merged. * In 1986, the two former hospitals formally completed their merger. * In 1989, Kapiolani purchased for $76 million the new 116-bed Pali Momi Medical Center in Aiea, built by Health Care International, six months after it opened. * In 2001, Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children and Kapiolani Medical Center at Pali Momi in Aiea merged with Wilcox Memorial Hospital in Lihue on the Hawaiian island of Kauai (founded in 1938) and the Straub Clinic & Hospital (founded in 1921) on King Street, under a new parent company, Hawaii Pacific Health.

Georgetown was the first Baptist college founded west of the Allegheny Mountains, and Giddings Hall was the first permanent structure constructed after the college was formed. The building is named after Rockwood Giddings, the third president of the school. The property was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on February 6, 1973. History In 1829, the Kentucky Legislature chartered the Kentucky Baptist Education Society with the purpose of establishing a Baptist college in the state. The town of Georgetown was selected for the site of the school because the community agreed to raise $20,000 and to donate the assets of Rittenhouse Academy, a failed land grant school in the town that had recently closed. In 1839, Rev. Rockwood Giddings became the third president of the college. During his tenure as president, Giddings began construction on Recitation Hall, the first permanent building for the school. College tradition states that Jonathan E. Farnam, professor of mathematics, drew the original plans for the building, and that architect A.T. Rice drew the final design. A local African-American mason laid the foundation, and a local brickmason named A.L. White built the walls. The structure is currently used as the main administrative building for the campus. Previously, rooms in the building have been used as a chapel, a library, classrooms, and a theater. Architecture left Giddings Hall is a two-story rectangular temple-style Greek Revival brick building situated at a prominent central campus location at the head of Giddings Circle. The building has four levels, including a stone basement and a deep attic. The brick is laid in Flemish bond on all four sides, and wide pilasters delineate the bays on all facades. The central front facade is a two-story pedimented portico with six brick graduated columns with Ionic capitals. The college's early association with Elijah Craig, who historically is linked to inventing Bourbon whiskey, has fueled a local legend claiming that \\"a quart of bourbon reposes under each of the six Ionic columns of the portico\\". The double windows and Italianate style hoodmolds were added in 1879 when Pawling Hall was constructed.

The series follows the dysfunctional Griffin family‚Äîfather Peter, mother Lois, daughter Meg, son Chris, baby Stewie and their anthropomorphic dog Brian, all of whom reside in their hometown of Quahog. The show features the voices of series creator Seth MacFarlane, Alex Borstein, Seth Green, Lacey Chabert and later Mila Kunis in the roles of the Griffin family. The executive producers for the second production season were David Zuckerman and MacFarlane; the aired season also contained eight episodes which were holdovers from season one. By the end of the second season, due to low ratings, Fox resorted to canceling Family Guy. However, following a last-minute reprieve, it returned for a third season in 2001. The series was canceled again in 2002; however, high ratings on Adult Swim and high DVD sales renewed Fox's interest in the series. The series returned for a total of 30 new episodes in 2005. The season received a positive reception from critics, who called the series \\"extremely witty and darkly hilarious,\\" and was \\"unfortunately\\" canceled. The Volume One DVD box set was released in Region 1 on April 15, 2003 and Region 2 on November 12, 2001. All twenty-one of the season's episodes are included in the volume. The first season's seven episodes were also included in the volume. Production In 2002, Family Guy was canceled after three seasons due to low ratings. The show was first canceled after the 1999‚Äì2000 season, but following a last- minute reprieve, it returned for a third season in 2001. During the third season, Fox announced that the show was canceled for good. Fox tried to sell rights for reruns of the show, but it was hard to find networks that were interested; Cartoon Network eventually bought the rights, \\" basically for free\\", according to the president of 20th Century Fox Television Production. When the reruns were shown on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim in 2003, Family Guy became Adult Swim's most-watched show with an average 1.9 million viewers an episode. Following Family Guys high ratings on Adult Swim, the first and second seasons was released on DVD in April 2003. Sales of the DVD set reached 2.2 million copies, becoming the best-selling television DVD of 2003 and the second highest-selling television DVD ever, behind the first season of Comedy Central's Chappelle's Show. The third season DVD release also sold more than a million copies. The show's popularity in both DVD sales and reruns rekindled Fox's interest in it. They ordered 35 new episodes in 2004, marking the first revival of a television show based on DVD sales. Fox president Gail Berman said that it was one of her most difficult decisions to cancel the show, and was therefore happy it would return. The network also began production of a film based on the series. Mila Kunis replaced Lacey Chabert as the voice of Meg from the third episode of this season onwards. Reception The second season of Family Guy received positive reviews from critics. Aaron Beierle of DVD Talk said \\"Often brilliant, extremely witty and darkly hilarious, Family Guy was unfortunately canceled after Fox bumped it around six or seven different time slots. Fans of the show should definitely pick up this terrific sets , while those who haven't seen it should consider giving it a look.\\" Fewer critics responded negatively to the season, including Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly, who graded the series a \\"D\\", and named it the worst show of the 1999‚Äì2000 television season.\\"Here is a worthy successor to Arli$ as The Awful Show They Just Keep Putting on the Air, a phenomenon as inexplicable as where Larry King gets all his suspenders. As long as they keep bringing back Family Guy, a hunk of ugly animation, I'll keep using it to line the bottom of this barrel.\\" Mark Graham noted \\"MacFarlane's incredibly rocky relationship with both the magazine and its lead television critic, Ken Tucker\\" in a blog on the New York magazine website. Tucker has also criticized the show for perceived anti-Semitism.\\"Racist, antisemitic, and AIDS jokes; shoddy animation; stolen ideas: the cartoon as vile swill.\\" L. Brent Bozell III expressed in a column of his written in 1999 that he felt that the episode \\"Holy Crap\\" promoted anti-Catholicism.\\"...if a TV series contains a blast at religion that virtually no one knew was coming, it not only reaches millions, catching them by surprise, but also goes essentially unanswered.

In May 2000, in its weekly \\"E-Alert\\" email newsletter, the PTC launched a letter-writing campaign to the Fox network to persuade the network to cancel Family Guy following a return from a long hiatus in the show's second season, due to what the PTC claimed were \\"strong advertiser resistance and low ratings\\".Parents Television Council E-Alert. Vol. 4, No. 26. May 5, 2000. \\"In the two months since the show returned, creator Seth MacFarlane has aggressively sought to push the content envelope. Worse, Fox has permitted him to do so.

Prior to being established in 1951, school librarians were served by the School Library Section of ALA founded in 1914, which emerged from the Roundtable of Normal and High School Librarians. The mission of the American Association of School Librarians is to empower leaders to transform teaching and learning.  History  At the 1914 ALA Midwinter Conference, a petition from the Roundtable of Normal and High School Librarians for a School Libraries Section was approved. In 1915, at the ALA Annual Conference, Mary E. Hall was elected the section's first president. ALA sections serve the larger membership divisions, of which there are currently eleven. The title AASL was first used in 1944, as part of the ALA's Division of Libraries for Children and Young People. Demand for AASL division status peaked in 1950, when a preconference was held to discuss separating AASL into its own independent division. On January 1, 1951, AASL achieved independent division status. The first president of AASL was Laura K. Martin, who served in 1951-1952. In 1980, AASL held its first national conference in Louisville, Kentucky. In the off years when a national conference is not held, AASL holds a Fall Forum over several days instead. The first Fall Forum was held in Dallas, Texas in 2004 At times, AASL has been at odds with its parent organization. At the 1984 ALA Midwinter Meeting, AASL directors discussed options for obtaining more independence from ALA. Two of the Future Structures Committee's more radical recommendations included a federated structure for AASL, or even secession from ALA. In November 2015, the House and Senate Conference Committee added language to the Every Student Succeeds Act, recognizing the value of school libraries, an important milestone for AASL and ALA. For 2017, AASL is planning on introducing the AASL Induction Program, a leadership program for new school library professionals.  Advocacy  Advocacy is an important part of the AASL mission. In 1948, AASL first put forth a list of school library standards. Recent AASL efforts have advocated for flexible scheduling of school library media centers, as well as information literacy. AASL established Banned Websites Awareness Day to call attention to the large number of educational websites that are inadvertently blocked by school website filtering software. This awareness day occurs the Wednesday during Banned Books Week. AASL also created School Library Month, held every April, to showcase school librarians and school library programs. The first School Library Month (then titled School Library Media Month) was held April 1, 1985.  Affiliate Assembly  Since 1977, the AASL Affiliate Assembly has provided a way for school library professionals in each state to relay their concerns to the AASL Board of Directors. The assembly is made up of two representatives, also called delegates, from each affiliated state organization. These affiliated organizations include regional and state school library associations. Delegates are usually the presidents or other officers of the affiliated organizations they represent. Delegates alert the Board of both good and bad in the field through a concerns and commendations process. Statements of Commendation are intended to provide worthy programs with accolades at the national level. Recent Statements of Concern range from improving communication with other divisions within ALA to monitoring the increasing number of public libraries managing school libraries. Statements of Concern are not abstract creations. They are focused concerns that must include a doable plan of action.  Publications  AASL publishes standards for school libraries that provide benchmarks and insight into the indicators for each standard. Its various publications assist in helping school librarians establish effective library programs that meet the needs of the changing school library environment. These titles include its journal Knowledge Quest and an open-access online research journal School Library Research.

The parish was established in 1882 to serve the area's French Canadian immigrant population and remained the French-Canadian National Parish until 1957. It has been staffed by the Fathers of the Blessed Sacrament since 1900.Lafort, Remigius The Catholic Church in the United States of America: Undertaken to Celebrate the Golden Jubilee of His Holiness, Pope Pius X. Volume 3: The Province of Baltimore and the Province of New York, Section 1: Comprising the Archdiocese of New York and the Diocese of Brooklyn, Buffalo and Ogdensburg Together with some Supplementary Articles on Religious Communities of Women.. (New York City: The Catholic Editing Company, 1914), p.337. Financier Thomas Fortune Ryan, a Catholic convert in his teens, bankrolled its construction. It was designed by Nicholas Serracino, an Italian architect practicing in New York, who, inspired by the Italian Mannerists, p.169 combined elements of the Italian Renaissance Revival and Classical Revival architectural styles, Seracino won first prize for the design at the Esposizione Internazionale delle Industrie e del Lavoro in Turin, Italy in 1911. It is his only surviving church in the city. The church is one of the few Catholic churches in New York City with a dome, and only one of two - the other being St. Patrick's Cathedral - with stained glass windows from the glass studios of Chartres. The building was designated a city landmark in 1969, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 along with its rectory. From 1995‚Äì96 the interior and exterior were both restored and renovated. Started in 1882 in a rented hall above a stable, the congregation has been through three buildings at two locations. St. Jean Baptiste High School was started on the grounds as an elementary school by nuns of the Congregation of Notre Dame in 1886. In the late 19th century, an exposure by a visiting priest of a relic of St. Anne, intended for one night, grew into a three-week event during which many miracle cures were alleged by thousands of pilgrims who crowded the church; as a result, the church now has its own shrine to the saint, which led to a failed effort to get it designated a basilica. In 1900 it passed from the control of the founding Fathers of Mercy to the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament, who introduced Eucharistic adoration as a worship style. Property The church is located on the east side of Lexington Avenue at 76th Street. The building takes up most of the lot, with the rectory on the south side, facing East 75th Street. The area is densely developed. St. Jean Baptiste High School, run by the church, is on the other side of 75th Street. Lenox Hill Hospital is nearby. Exterior The building, which opened in the spring of 1913, is faced in limestone. Its west (front) facade is rich in ornament. The main entrance is located in a pedimented portico with full entablature on a high plinth supported by four Corinthian columns. This design is echoed with smaller pediments on each of the side entrances above carved festoon and scroll motifs. Above a broad cornice, twin bell towers rise to a total height of at the corners. Their lower stages with canted corners have round-arched openings framed by pilasters. Above them an open circle of Corinthian columns supports a ribbed dome, topped by a smaller version of the top with a cross. These are echoes of the larger dome in the middle of the church that rises to . Between the two towers, on the parapet, a statue of angels supporting a globe echoes the pediment below. The gabled, gently pitched roofs are sheathed in copper. On either side of the front facade, projecting entrance bays with windows are topped with a statue of an angel blowing a trumpet. The side elevations, of which only the north is visible from the street, have high round-arched windows and continue the cornice at the roofline. Pediments similar to those on the front grace the second story above the windows on either end of the transept. Interior Inside, the barrel-vaulted nave is separated from the vaulted aisles by an arcade of tall Corinthian columns; the vault springs from the entablature. All the vaults, ribs and arches are richly decorated with Florentine-style reliefs. The column capitals and fluting are also gilded. The center of the nave vault has trompe-l'≈ìil paintings of the heavens; an elaborate Florentine-style floral pattern decorates the interior of the dome. Against the apse triforium on the east wall of the church stands the high altar with a mosaic half-dome, statues, and smaller bas-relief sculptures. The shrine of St. Anne is located here. A six-foot-tall (2 m) monstrance, for showing the Eucharist to believers for prayer and contemplation, crowns the altar. Smaller baldachins shelter the smaller altars on the sides. To the left is an altar to Mary of Carrara marble; to the right is a similar one honoring St. Joseph. At the transept corners are smaller altars to Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament founder St. Peter Julian Eymard, with a relic in a case below; the other corner's altar is to St. Anthony of Padua. The walls and ceilings are otherwise decorated with paintings in the Baroque style. The stained glass windows and high altar were brought to New York from Chartres, France and Italy, respectively, following World War I. On three levels, from the dome to the nave, the windows portray the Twelve Apostles, scenes from the Old Testament which prefigure the Christian sacrament of the Eucharist, and events in the life and ministry of Jesus, including the Last Supper and the institution of the Eucharist and the Easter appearance of Christ to the disciples at Emmaus. The high altar is tall. A team of artisans accompanied the various pieces of the altar from Italy and reassembled it in the sanctuary. Under the dome is the altar table, made of white marble. At the center of the frontal is a Christogram, IHS, from the first three letters of Jesus (ŒôŒóŒ£ŒüŒ•Œ£) in Greek. The pews, choir stalls, and confessionals are of oak and are elaborately carved. Eucharistic images, especially wheat shocks and clusters of grapes, are prominent throughout the building. A restoration of the interior was completed in November 1998. Associated structures The Rev. A. Letellier, rector, had a five-storey brick and stone rectory at 170‚Äì190 East 76th Street and 1067 Lexington Avenue built in 1911 to designs by Nicholas Serracino of 1170 Broadway for $80,000. The rectory is also an Italian Renaissance-style palazzo. Five stories high, it is faced in white brick with granite steps leading down to 76th Street. The seven-bay north (front) facade features limestone voussoirs crowning each window. The end bays project slightly and are set off with large pilasters. The ground floor is rusticated. Limestone string courses are above the second and fourth stories, with a plain entablature and overhanging cornice at the roofline. There have been few alterations to the exterior. The interior, by contrast, has been extensively remodeled over time. Only the oak woodwork remains from the original building. The Most Rev. Pat. J. Hayes had a four-storey brick school with a tile roof at 163‚Äì173 East 75th built in 1925 to designs by Robert J. Reiley of 50 East 41st Street for $300,000. A five-storey brick brothers apartment building at 194 East 76th Street, was built in 1930 to designs by Robert J. Reiley of 50 East 41st Street for $70,000 to 90,000. A five-storey brick sisters apartment house at 163‚Äì175 East 75th Street and 170‚Äì198 East 76th Street and 1061‚Äì1071 Lexington Avenue was built in 1931 to designs by Robert J. Reiley of 50 East 41st Street for $125,000.Office for Metropolitan History, \\"Manhattan NB Database 1900‚Äì1986,\\" (Accessed December 25, 2010).  History  From its origins in a rented hall above a stable, p.212-213 with an almost exclusively French Canadian congregation, St. Jean Baptiste has grown to be one of New York's most distinctive Catholic churches. It has been through three buildings in two locations and under the care of two different orders of priests. 1841‚Äì82: Establishment of parish In the early 19th century, one in every nine New Yorkers was of French descent. Most were Huguenots, Protestant refugees from the French Revolution, but there were some Catholics. In 1841, Bishop de Forbin-Janson, on a missionary tour to the United States for the Fathers of Mercy, lamented that French-American Catholics in New York City had not been as devoted to raising churches in their national customs as Irish and Italian immigrants had. The community responded to this challenge, and accordingly the first Church of St. Vincent de Paul was opened the next year on Canal Street. That church grew, and moved north to 23rd Street in 1868. A French Canadian immigrant community had begun to flourish in Yorkville at that time, and found it trying to make the trip downtown for services. A missionary to this community found that services closer to home would be beneficial, similar to those the Jesuits at what is now St. Ignatius Loyola had organized for Yorkville's Germans. The order's provincial gave his support for the establishment of a national parish, and a meeting of the immigrants' St. Jean Societ√© in 1881 raised $12 ($ in contemporary dollars) to that end. This is considered the beginning of the church's history. A chapel was established in a rented hall above a stable on East 77th Street. The constant noise from the horses downstairs earned the chapel the nickname \\"Crib of Bethlehem\\" from congregants. A few months later, Cardinal John McCloskey, Archbishop of the Diocese of New York and the first American cardinal, granted permission to build a church, formalizing the parish. The new parish was able to raise $14,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) to buy a property on the north side of East 76th Street in 1882. By the end of the year Coadjutor Archbishop (later full Archbishop) Michael Corrigan had blessed the new building's cornerstone. Napoleon LeBrun's design called for a simple Gothic Revival church building, long by wide, with room for 600. Its projected cost was $20,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) but it soon ran into difficulties when problems with using the \\"crib of Bethlehem\\" forced the use of the unfinished church's basement during Lent in 1883. Archbishop Corrigan had to take title to the church to save it. 1882‚Äì1900: First church and St. Anne's shrine The new church was successful not only with its intended French Canadian community, but with all Catholics on the Upper East Side. Many were servants in the nearby houses of the city's wealthier residents and had to report for their jobs early, thus appreciating a nearby church where they could first attend Mass. In 1886, nuns from the Congregation of Notre Dame, founded in colonial Montreal in the mid-17th century, came to establish an elementary school. In 1892, the church inadvertently became a shrine of St. Anne. A Canadian priest, Father J.C. Marquis, dropped in at the rectory unexpectedly on May 1, needing a place to stay while he carried a relic of the saint that Pope Leo XIII had given him back to Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupr√©, Quebec. The pastor at the time asked him to expose it to the parishioners during vespers that evening. Marquis did so, as he would continue to Quebec the next day. News that the relic would be exposed soon reached the community, and a large crowd showed up for evening services. When a young man having an epileptic fit was touched by it, his convulsions ceased. That apparent miracle was widely reported and even more crowds showed up, many expecting cures. The pastor asked Marquis to stay for a few more days with the relic to satisfy the many pilgrims. His stay would be extended to three weeks as thousands of pilgrims came. As he finally left on May 20, crowds bade the relic farewell and asked that she return again for good next time. Father Marquis was so impressed that he promised to obtain a relic for St. Jean. With the permission of Cardinal Elz√©ar-Alexandre Taschereau, he divided the relic once he had reached Sainte-Anne and returned to New York with it in July. More crowds came, more miracles were reported, and Marquis reported favorably on this to the pope. As a result, he was able to make a return trip to the shrine of St. Anne in Apt, France, and brought a relic back specifically for St. Jean Baptiste. 1900‚Äì18: Change in leadership and new church In 1900 the efforts of a wealthy local Catholic activist, Eliza Lummis, brought the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament (SSS), an international religious order of priests, brothers, and deacons founded by St. Peter Julian Eymard in Paris in 1856, to New York. They were unable to find a center for their work, but often attended Mass and resided at the St. Jean Baptiste rectory. One day, the pastor joked to the Blessed Sacrament priests that if they could not find a church, he'd just have to give them his. That remark got back to Archbishop Corrigan, who informed St. Jean Baptiste's pastor the very next day that he was putting St. Jean Baptiste under the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament's control. Throughout the rest of the year the interior of the LeBrun church was altered to be more in keeping with the Congregation's Eucharistic style of worship. East 76th Street facade (2014) The continuous exposure of the Sacrament, and the availability of daily confessions and early Mass at what was known as \\"Old St. Jean's\\" led to another increase in the size of the congregation. Corrigan had said at the first Mass that he expected the church would soon be outgrown and a new one built more worthy of Christ. During one Mass, financier and philanthropist Thomas Fortune Ryan, a Virginian who converted to Catholicism as a young man and who, with his wife Ida Barry Ryan, supported the construction of churches, schools, and other charitable institutions along the Eastern Seaboard, arrived late and had to stand. He preferred St. Jean to the larger churches closer to his Fifth Avenue mansion, and often attended services there. He heard Father Arthur Letellier, the new pastor, ask the congregation's prayers for a new church, and afterwards asked how much one would cost. \\"About $300,000\\" ($ in contemporary dollars) he was told. \\"Very well\\", he replied. \\"Have your plans made and I will pay for the church\\". At first Ryan had wanted a church similar in size to the existing one, but Letellier persuaded him it was time for a church with room for 1,200 people, twice the LeBrun church's capacity. Italian architect Nicholas Serracino, who had been living in New York for the decade, won the commission. He produced a model of a grand Renaissance Revival church with a dome and classically inspired front facade. His design reflected Catholics' search for a unique architectural style for their churches, since the Gothic Revival and neo-Gothic designs had become associated with Protestant churches. In 1911 Serracino's renderings of the unfinished church won first prize at the International Exhibition in Turin. Ryan was initially skeptical of the dome, but when he saw how it won praise on a model of Serracino's design he authorized the additional $43,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) for it. This would not be the only cost overrun. Serracino underestimated the costs of local labor and materials. Bedrock was deeper than originally believed because of the marshes filled in when the area was originally developed in the mid-19th century. The cost of the foundation increased eightfold as a result, and plans to gild the dome and finish the interior with marble had to be canceled. The widening of Lexington Avenue also forced Serracino to scale back his original plans for a grand triumphal arch portico with full-width steps. Ryan continued to provide funds for a final total cost of $600,000 ($ in contemporary dollars). The rectory, also designed by Serracino, was built and opened in 1911. The lower church in the basement was finished and consecrated in 1913 by Camillus Paul Maes, bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Covington, who had been the Congregation's strongest supporter in the U.S. Early in the following year, he attended the first Mass celebrated in the upper church, even before the walls and ceilings were finished, by Father Letellier. Cardinal John Murphy Farley, the archbishop, spoke at the end of the service and read a congratulatory telegram from Pope Pius X. 1918‚Äì87: The church in a changing city Within a few years of its construction, the new church twice became a crime scene. The first occasion was the night of November 30, 1918, when police pursued a man named Charles George into the church following a carjacking. The police and George had been exchanging gunfire, and it continued as he ran up the stairs into the choir. When he ran out of ammunition, he surrendered. Several women who had been praying in the church at the time had to be treated for hysteria. Almost a year later, on November 29, 1919, Cecilia Simon, a maid at an East 56th Street home, was arrested in the church when she knocked statuary and a candelabra valued at $3,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) onto the floor and shattering them after a funeral service. She was taken to Bellevue Hospital for observation. While apparently a devout enough Catholic to be a daily communicant, she was not a member of the church. At services there the previous Sunday, investigators found that in a collection envelope she had placed a note registering her objection to the arrangement on the altar. A coworker said that she had been acting strangely all week and had said she was going to \\"do some good work\\" at church that day. In 1920 Mayor John Francis Hylan and Governor Al Smith were among the 100,000 Catholics who signed a petition to the new pope, Benedict XV, to designate St. Jean Baptiste a basilica. It failed. Later in the decade the church's interior decoration was gradually installed and finished. Ryan's funeral was held in the church he had paid so much to build in 1928. In 1929 the sisters of Notre Dame opened a high school to go with the elementary school they had been running for almost 40 years. The interior of the church was modified slightly in the 1950s during renovations. The Requiem Mass for Ryan's grandson Clendenin J. Ryan, publisher of The American Mercury, was held there in 1957 after his suicide. In the 1960s, following Vatican II, the church began to change, as much due to the changing demographics of its parish as the council. It stopped celebrating Mass in French, and the elementary school was closed nearly ninety years after its founding. In 1969 the city made the church one of its first designated landmarks. The next year crime once again intruded into the church when an elderly woman was stabbed on a staircase within by three youths. 1987‚Äìpresent: Renovation In 1989 stones from the facade fell onto the Lexington Avenue sidewalk. No one was injured, but the church had to erect a wooden shelter to protect pedestrians from potential future incidents. That led to the restoration of the exterior over the next year, part of a $6 million campaign that began in 1987. Work on the stained glass windows proved particularly challenging because the original installers had forced them into spaces too small for them, making them hard to remove. It was necessary to hire more than the usual number of restorers, work overtime and locate the workshop in the dome rather than offsite in order to meet the church's fall 1997 deadlines. For several months during that time services were held in a nearby school auditorium. The renovations were overseen by the firm of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer. View from the southwest (2014) It was financed by the sale of land and air rights over a building formerly used as a convent by the sisters of Notre Dame, who subsequently moved into the upper floors of the rectory. A developer built The Siena, a 73-unit, 31-story luxury condominium tower, on the site. It has been praised by a group of architects including Robert A.M. Stern for complementing the architecture of the adjacent rectory by echoing the church's bell towers and offering \\"rich sculptural form and lively surface patterning ... to a neighborhood burdened by so many uninspired blocklike apartment buildings\\" In 2002, a longtime parishioner, Maryanne Macaluso, alleged that the new pastor, Father Mario Marzocchi, had groped and propositioned her after offering her a secretarial position. After she complained to another priest and took paid leave due to the stress of having to see Father Mazocchi every day, the order had him evaluated by a psychologist who found nothing wrong with him, and then transferred him to a parish in Florida. When she returned to work, she claims the church retaliated against her by cutting her work hours from full-time to part-time after several weeks and giving duties she normally performed to others. When she asked the replacement pastor, Father Anthony Schueller, for full-time work, he informed her that the church could not afford to do so and she requested a letter of termination, putting her in danger of being evicted from her apartment. After the state denied her unemployment claim on the grounds that she had left work voluntarily, Macaluso filed suit against the church, the order, the Archdiocese of New York, Cardinal Edward Egan, and Father Marzocchi. She alleged negligent hiring and hostile environment sexual harassment. In 2007 Judge Louis York of the New York Supreme Court dismissed her claims, without ruling on the facts, against all but Father Marzocchi, who had not responded.; New York Supreme Court; February 27, 2007; retrieved May 30, 2011. Programs and services The church celebrates Mass three times a day and five times on Sunday, with a Saturday night vigil. The Eucharist is exposed for prayer and contemplation at all other times. Confession is available for a half-hour daily and twice on Saturdays. The Liturgy of the Hours is observed twice daily and once on Sundays. Devotions to St. Anne are observed twice on Tuesday with an annual novena observed leading up to her July 26 feast day, to the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament's founder St. Peter Julien Eymard after Thursday's Masses, and to the Sacred Heart of Jesus after Friday evening Mass. The Rosary is prayed at noon Monday through Saturday. The church's musical ministry is led by its organist, who also directs two choirs, one of volunteers and the other professionals. A thrift shop is run in the basement, next to the community center. A toddler play group and senior group are held there at different times of the week. Also in the basement is the Kathryn Martin Theater, which has hosted a number of musical performances, both church- and non-church-related. In the broader community, the church, in conjunction with the sisters of Notre Dame, continues to operate St. Jean Baptiste High School for girls. The congregation is a member of the Yorkville Common Pantry and the Neighborhood Coalition for Shelter. The community center is also available for rent to individuals and organizations.

History  Stara Pe≈°ƒçenica began as a village in the vicinity of Zagreb in the 19th century. After the Mo≈°insky's 1902 annexation of La≈°ƒáina and ≈Ωitnjak municipalities into the City of Zagreb, and urban sprawl encompassing areas east of Heinzel Avenue, poor settlements sprang up north of the railway exiting the city. One of these settlements was Stara Pe≈°ƒçenica, growing along the namesake street. The other one was Naselak, a street, which over time became engulfed by Stara Pe≈°ƒçenica. Though, most of the houses are still standing to date, to which the neighborhood owes an anachronous appearance. After the World War I, the Austro-Hungarian empire dissolved and Zagreb was incorporated in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. While being a capital of a province of sorts, Zagreb stopped being in a shadow cast by an economically and culturally more important city. It became the center of the Yugoslav economy and started to attract workers and people from rural areas. The population more than doubled in the next twenty years. While the city area (today Donji Grad) remained on the same area, the suburbs vastly spread out. The poor neighborhoods moved further east and the northern part of Stara Pe≈°ƒçenica became a part of the well-designed wealthy \\"officer apartment city district\\". On the other hand, the rest of Pe≈°ƒçenica (including southern part of Stara Pe≈°ƒçenica) remained cheap and randomly parcelized land, having estate prices up to 8 times lower than Donji Grad. The Zvonimirova Street served as a boundary between the rich and the poor.

Foundation  The festival is one of the most enduring amateur festivals of its kind in the United Kingdom, having been founded in 1959 and celebrating its 50th festival in 2008 (from 30 September 2008 to 11 October 2008). The festival is organised by the Woking Drama Association. The first winning play was \\"Master Dudley by Philip Johnson, performed by the Pyrford Little Theatre.Woking Drama Festival website  Woking Drama Association  The Woking Drama Association, or WDA, was founded to encourage and support the performing arts in Woking. As such, most of the leading local theatre and drama groups in the Surrey area belong to the WDA, as well as from further afield across the south of England. The WDA is also affiliated to many of the leading drama associations, particularly the National Drama Festivals Association. One of its primary aims is to present an annual drama festival in Woking every October. Outside of the annual drama festival, the WDA works as a focal point for local theatre groups and as a point of reference for directors looking for on-stage talent, backstage; props; costumes or set building.Woking Drama Association (WDA)  Rhoda McGaw Theatre  The festival is held in Woking, Surrey, in the Rhoda McGaw Theatre (within The Ambassadors, Peacock Centre).  Participating drama groups  Over the years the Woking Festival has grown to become \\"one of the largest drama competitions in the British Isles and certainly one of the most respected for its quality of performance\\". In 2008 the WDA had 16 member groups.

He served as Vice Chancellor at UCLA for 13 years, was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. The chemistry building at UCLA bears his name.  Education  Young was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and attended Colorado College, graduating with a BA in 1924 and a Master's Degree in 1925. He worked with H.A. Spoehr at the Carnegie Institution for Science before enrolling at the California Institute of Technology to pursue his doctorate in physical organic chemistry under the direction of Howard J. Lucas. Young served as a National Research Council postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University for one year, before joining the faculty at UCLA, where he would remain for his entire career (through 1970).  Career = Research  Young's research interests centered on molecular rearrangements of allyl groups, including higher-order allyl groups such as crotyl, prenyl, and various allyl organometallic reagents. In a series of over 30 subsequent publications, Young examined rate constants, substitution preference, stereochemistry, and alternate reaction sites of allyl transfers. He also collaborated with student groups to develop glassware and lab tools, for instance the ubiquitous glass helices found in fractionation columns used to separate isomeric volatiles. Perhaps Young's longest legacy - apart from his 130 research publications - was serving as the doctoral advisor to chemist and nuclear magnetic resonance pioneer John D. Roberts.  Administration  Young was appointed Dean of Physical Sciences at UCLA in 1948, serving in this capacity until 1957. He was named Vice Chancellor for Planning from 1957 until his retirement in 1970.  Pedagogy  Young was revered as a master educator and mentor. He devoted his entire Priestley Medal address to issues of chemical education, given increasing pressures from post-World War II research enterprise expansion, increased student enrollment in the sciences, and the rapid adoption of newer analytical instrumentation ‚Äì NMR, mass spectrometry, HPLC, infrared spectroscopy, among others ‚Äì into undergraduate curricula. He pointed out the inherent paradox in his \\"crossroads\\" analogy: as technology enabled deeper study of quantitative chemical data, it also called for reducing hours spent in chemistry so candidates could broaden their study into related fields such as botany, zoology, or molecular biology.  Personal life  At 24, Bill Young married Helen Graybeal; they would remain married until his death in 1980. Their interests, according to Young's memorial, included golf, travel, and UCLA athletics games.

Professional baseball career Tipton was drafted in the thirteenth round of the 1939 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins, but chose to play professional baseball instead. He played outfield for the Philadelphia Athletics (1939‚Äì1941) and the Cincinnati Reds (1942‚Äì1945). His best seasons in the majors were in 1943 and 1944, when he had 142 hits and batted .288 in '43, and had 144 hits and batted .301 in '44. Tipton then played in the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball with the St. Paul Saints, 1946‚Äì1951, and the Portland Beavers, 1952, of the Pacific Coast League. In 501 games in seven seasons, Tipton posted a .270 batting average (439-for-1626) with 212 runs, 22 home runs, 151 RBI and 223 bases on balls.

This is widely presumed to be the origin of the name of Cross Lake in Pimicikamak territory.Note that there was another Cross Lake, now flooded, that was upstream of Grand Rapids, Manitoba, on the Saskatchewan River. \\"Pimicikamak\\" is the collective singular name for the whole peopleThe singular noun is Pimicikamowinew; its plural is Pimicikamowinewuk. and also the collective name for its traditional territory.

Canada's history of suppressing indigenous languages, including aboriginal peoples' use of their own names such as \\"Pimicikamak\\", was controversial until 2008, when Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper publicly acknowledged and apologized for this policy.Hansard, Wednesday, June 11, 2008, Stephen Harper, \\"Apology to Former Students of Indian Residential Schools\\", http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=3568890&Language;=E&Mode;=1&Parl;=39&Ses;=2, accessed 1 August 2008. The name \\"Pimicikamak\\" appears to have entered into English-language usage by Cree-speakers in the 1990s. \\"The Pimicikamak Cree Nation\\" is a polyglot and imprecise description of Pimicikamak, not a name. It is also known in English as \\"the Cross Lake Band\\", a description that may be confused with the Cross Lake Band of Indians (now known as the \\"Cross Lake First Nation\\").See, for example: \\"Cross Lake Band\\", http://crosslakeband.ca/, accessed 4 September 2008.  Traditional territory  Aboriginal concepts of territory are sui generis and do not correspond to those of Western cartography.\\"[T]he fact that land occupied a central position in the traditional world did not necessarily mean there was a comprehensive monopolistic concept of power applicable to all matters, to every person and thing within a rigorously laid-out geometric boundary that was unique and fixed in space.\\" Ghislain Otis, \\"Territoriality, Personality, and the Promotion of Aboriginal Legal Traditions\\", in Indigenous Legal Traditions, ed. Law Commission of Canada, UBC Press, Vancouver (2007), p. 146. Pimicikamak's traditional territory is reported to have been the watershedTypically, river basins were reported to be the basis of distinct peoples' territories in the region; see: Victor P. Lytwyn, Muskekowuck Athinuwick: Original People of the Great Swampy Land, University of Manitoba Press , Winnipeg (2000), pp. 12 - 13. of the upper Nelson River.Margaret Anne Lindsay & Jennifer S.H. Brown, The History of the Pimicikamak People to the Treaty Five Period, The Centre for Rupert's Land Studies at The University of Winnipeg (2008); this is consistent with the difference between the intended and actual boundaries of Treaty 5 in 1875. It is located within the boreal forest or taiga of Canada. Like other indigenous peoples, Pimicikamak sees its spiritual relationship with the land as fundamental to its identity.Ronald Niezen, Defending the Land: Sovereignty and Forest Life in James Bay Cree Society, Allyn and Bacon, Boston (1998); and see Ghislain Otis, \\"Territoriality, Personality, and the Promotion of Aboriginal Legal Traditions\\", in Indigenous Legal Traditions, ed. Law Commission of Canada, UBC Press, Vancouver (2007), p. 145, emphasizing \\"the importance of the material and cultural connection with the land that was often a sacred space and the very foundation of communal life.\\" Displacing indigenous spirituality through Christian missions was said to be \\"one of the most effective tools of assimilation\\" leading to \\"conformity within newly prescribed territorial limits.\\"Ronald Niezen, Spirit Wars: Native North American Religions in the Age of Nation Building, University of California Press, Berkeley (2000), pp. 222-3. Canadian law continues to recognize relationships of aboriginal peoples with their traditional (c.f., treaty) territories.E.g., Mikisew v.

History  Oral history passed down by Pimicikamak elders says that Pimicikamak existed since time immemorial. Anthropological and archaeological evidence places aboriginal occupation of Pimicikamak after the last ice age \\"sometime before 4000 B.C.E.\\"Lindsay & Brown, History of the Pimicikamak People to the Treaty Five Period, p. 1. European documentary records date back at least to 1768, when a map showed Pemichicomo Lake in the area known as Rupert's Land.Andrew Graham, ‚ÄúA Plan of Part of Hudson‚Äôs Bay and Rivers Communicating with the Principal Settlements‚Äù, (1768) in John Warkentin & Richard Ruggles, Historical Atlas of Manitoba, The Historical and Scientific Society of Manitoba, Winnipeg (1970), p. 95.

Pimicikamak made treaty (Treaty 5) with the Crown in 1875. In 1977 it was party to an amendmentAn agreement with Canada, Manitoba and Manitoba Hydro dated December 16, 1977, informally known as the Northern Flood Agreement. to address effects of the Nelson River Hydroelectric Project operations on its Treaty 5 rights.  Constitution  Like other indigenous peoples in Turtle Island (the name for North America in many indigenous languages), Pimicikamak was constituted under spiritual law. These were passed down orally through stories and reflected in ceremonies and traditions of the Pimicikamak people. They formed part of the culture that enabled it to survive as a people in a harsh environment.See: \\"K√∂ppen climate classification\\", sub-arctic climate Dfc, Tom L. McKnight & Darrell Hess, \\"Climate Zones and Types: The K√∂ppen System\\", in Physical Geography: A Landscape Appreciation, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ (2000). Treaty 5, signed by the British Crown and by Tepastenam and two others on Pimicikamak's behalf in 1875, clearly were intended to and did amend this customary constitution. Pimicikamak is a body politic or corporate.Gillespie, C., Portrait of a People: A Study in Survival, Winnipeg: Big Fizz (2017), p. 97. In 1996, Pimicikamak enacted its First Written Law which began the adaptation of its constitution to modern circumstances.See: Galit A. Sarfaty, \\"International Norm Diffusion in the Pimicikamak Cree Nation: A Model of Legal Mediation\\", (2007) 48 Harvard International Law Journal 441, at p. 473.\\"Based on ... inherent jurisdiction, the Cree ratified The First Written Law ... which laid the foundation for their adaptation of customary practices. ... It outlines the constitutional powers of the Pimicikamak Cree Nation...\\" Since the 1990s Pimicikamak has made other written laws with constitutional effect in the English language, including a citizenship law and an election law. These are based on consensus.Pimicikamak, The First Written Law, 1996, http://pimicikamak.ca/html%20pages/Laws/Pimicikamak/First%20Law.html. The government of Canada has doubted the validity of the First Written Law and written laws made pursuant to it but accepted the validity of one such law, The Pimicikamak Election Law, 1999, on other grounds.  The Winnipeg Treaty  In 1875, the Ministry of the Interior determined to extend the Crown's treaty relations to the peoples east and west but not north of Lake Winnipeg.Privy Council Minutes, (1875) R.G. 2, Ser. 1, Vol. III, Minister David Laird, 2 July 1875, LAC, Privy Council Office, OIC 1875-0707, vol. 335, reel C-3312, access code 90, series A-1-d, vol. 2755. In September 1875, with Privy Council authority, Treaty Commissioners Alexander MorrisLieutenant- Governor of Keewatin and the North West Territories. and James McKay embarked on the Hudson's Bay Company steamer to several destinations on Lake Winnipeg to make a treaty whose terms, boundaries and signatories were essentially predetermined.Alexander Morris, The Treaties of Canada with the Indians, Belfords , Clarke & Co., Toronto (1880), pp. 145 et seq.; Morris named it the Winnipeg Treaty. The York boat trade via the Hayes River and York Factory on Hudson Bay having collapsed in competition with trade via the Mississippi River, Indians living at Norway House \\"whose occupation was gone, owing to supplies being brought in by way of the Red River of the North, desired to migrate to the western shore of Lake Winnipeg ...\\".Alexander Morris, The Treaties of Canada with the Indians, Belfords , Clarke & Co., Toronto (1880). Morris tells that upon arriving at Norway House, \\"We found that there were two distinct bands of Indians, the Christian Indians of Norway House, and the Wood or Pagan Indians of Cross Lake.\\" The latter were represented by Tepastenam. Pimicikamak evidently persuaded the Commissioners to include it in Treaty 5, signed on 24 September 1875.Lindsay & Brown, The History of the Pimicikamak People to the Treaty Five Period‚Äù, p. 87; J. Johnston, Map of Part of the North West Territory, including the Province of Manitoba, Exhibiting the several Tracts of Country ceded by the Indian Treaties 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 (1877), from Early Canadiana Online: http://canadiana.org/ECO. Treaty rights are collective, not individual. Under one interpretation of Canadian law, aboriginal peoples may have treaty rights, but these are vested with the entire community and not the band council.Vickers, J.: \\"While band level organization may have meaning to a Canadian federal bureaucracy, it is without any meaning in the resolution of Aboriginal title and rights for Tsilhqot‚Äôin people.\\" Tsilhqot'in Nation v.

Pimicikamak regards an 8 May 1998 document signed by representatives of Canada, Manitoba and Manitoba Hydro as a treaty. From the colonial perspective, some treaties with aboriginal peoples have been termed \\"a different method of expropriation\\".Patricia Seed, \\"Three Treaty Nations Compared: Economic and Political Consequences for Indigenous People in Canada, the United States and New Zealand\\", in Natives & Settlers - Now & Then, Paul W. DePasquale, ed., University of Alberta Press (2007), p. 17.  Flag  Pimicikamak also has a national flag.Recent oral history tells that this flag appeared to the Secretary to the Pimicikamak Councils in a dream.250px  Laws  Like other indigenous peoples that have existed for a long time, Pimicikamak has a body of oral customary law.In R. v Secretary of State For Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, [1982] 2 All E.R. 118 (U.K.), Lord Denning said, \\"These customary laws are not written down. They are handed down by tradition from one generation to another. Yet beyond doubt they are well established and have the force of law within the community.\\" In Campbell v. British Columbia, 2000 BCSC 1123 (Can.), http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/jdb- txt/sc/00/11/s00-1123.htm, Justice Williamson said, \\"such rules, whether they result from custom, tradition, agreement, or some other decision making process, are 'laws' in the Dicey constitutional sense.\\" Since 1995, Pimicikamak has made several customary written laws.They are in English, with the apparent objective that they be understood by non-Cree-speakers.  Government  Although Pimicikamak has four councils,I.e., the Women's Council, the Council of Elders, the Youth Council and the Executive Council. Pimicikamak government is, like that of Switzerland, inseparable from the people, with strong elements of direct democracy. Its First Written Law provides for modern customary laws in writing to be accepted by consensus of a general assembly of the Pimicikamak public.Pimicikamak, The First Written Law, 1996, http://pimicikamak.ca/html%20pages/Laws/Pimicikamak/First%20Law.html, accessed 4 September 2008. National policy is established by consensus of the Four Councils.The Four Councils is a single entity composed of the membership of each of the four councils. The Executive CouncilUntil 1999, Chief and Council of the Band acted as the Executive Council ex officio. is responsible for giving effect to national policy.The Pimicikamak Election Law, 1999, s. 15 & s. 23, http://www.pimicikamak.ca/law/LAWoELEf_cor.DOC , accessed 6 August 2008.  Traditional government  Oral history recorded by elders in the 1990s says that in traditional Pimicikamak government the people were warmed by four fires. These were Kiseyak Otabiwinik (where the Elders sit), Iskweyanak (the women), Opimbatawuk (the runners, or youth) and Okaniskoteyawuk (the hunters & warriors; lit., the keepers of the gate). The first two of these continued through the 20th century. The Council of Elders may have been based on Midewiwin society practices introduced hundreds of years ago from neighbouring Ojibwa (known to themselves as the Anishinaabeg). Oral history from the Elders provided the continuing source of Pimicikamak temporal or customary law. The Women's Council governed family and community life during winter dispersal and summer gatherings.  Women's Council  Historically, women appear to have had higher status in Cree societies than that accorded by contemporaneous European and some other aboriginal civilizations. \\"Cree women enjoyed a degree of autonomy that confounded European men who married Aboriginal women.\\"Lindsay & Brown, The History of the Pimicikamak People to the Treaty Five Period‚Äù, p. 53. \\"Crees viewed with contempt what they conceived as harsh treatment of women by Chipewyan males.\\"Robert Brightman, Grateful Prey, Rock Cree Human-Animal Relationships, Canadian Plains research Center, Regina (2002); citing Victor G. Hopwood, ed., David Thompson: Travels in Western North America 1784-1812, Macmillan, Toronto (1971), see p. 131. In the Pimicikamak world view, women are symbolically associated with water, life, the direction west, and the color red.\\"Women are water people because we are life-givers. We are part of the creation, we look after our communities and children. Water is the lifeblood of Mother Earth, flowing through her veins, the rivers and lakes.\\" Eugenie Mercredi, in Power Struggles: Hydro Development and First Nations in Manitoba and Quebec, Thibault Martin & Steven M. Hoffman, eds., University of Manitoba Press, Winnipeg (2008), p. 97. The Women's Council is viewed by some as first in precedence of the Pimicikamak councils.Pimicikamak as a society seems in another sense to deny the idea of precedence. The reason given is that all members of the Councils received the gift of life from women, beginning the circle of life.Contra: they also received that gift, so the circle has no beginning. Consistent with their historical status, the Women's Council has key rolesSarfaty attributes these roles to the influence of international human rights norms: Galit A. Sarfaty, \\"International Norm Diffusion in the Pimicikamak Cree Nation: A Model of Legal Mediation\\", (2007) 48 Harv. Int.

Law J. 441, n. 178 at p. 476, http://www.harvardilj.org/print/124, accessed 18 August 2008.  Council of Elders  Traditionally, elders were viewed as the lawyers or law-givers of Pimicikamak. They were the repository of the wisdom that enabled the Pimicikamak people to survive. Consistent with the traditional role, the Council of Elders must approve written laws by consensus. In recent times the fallout of the residential school system may have imposed difficulty on this role.  Youth Council  The Youth Council took on constitutional responsibilities in the 1990s.Pimicikamak, The First Written Law, 1996, s. 13, http://pimicikamak.ca/html%20pages/Laws/Pimicikamak/First%20Law.html, accessed 4 September 2008; Galit A.

Law J. 441, at p. 476, http://www.harvardilj.org/print/124, accessed 18 August 2008. It appears to be regarded as a traditional council.While not explicit de jure as for the other traditional councils, the Youth Council also may exercise a de facto veto over written laws; see the effect of: Pimicikamak, The First Written Law, 1996, ss. 15 - 19; http://pimicikamak.ca/html%20pages/Laws/Pimicikamak/First%20Law.html, accessed 4 September 2008.  Communities  The largest community in Pimicikamak is Cross Lake, now connected to the western part of its traditional territory by the Kichi Sipi Bridge. Thicket Portage, Pikwitonei and Wabowden are also largely Pimicikamak communities in the west and north of Pimicikamak traditional territory.Many of their residents are descended from those Pimicikamak who did not take up residence at Cross Lake after 1875. Non- Pimicikamak Canadian residents have rights under Treaty 5.

It is based on the true story of a working-class husband and wife who, acting alone, became part of the German Resistance. Fallada's book was one of the first anti-Nazi novels to be published by a German after World War II.  Background  Otto and Elise Hampel, a working class couple in Berlin, were not interested in politics, but after Elise Hampel learned that her sonIn the novel it is her son. In some film adaptions and translations it is her brother. As well in real life it was her brother. had fallen in France, she and her husband began committing acts of civil disobedience. They began writing leaflets on postcards, urging people to resist and overthrow the Nazis. They wrote hundreds of them, leaving them in apartment stairwells and dropping them into mailboxes. Though they knew the law made this a capital crime, they continued this work for well over a year until they were betrayed and arrested. They were tried by Nazi judge Roland Freisler and executed in Pl√∂tzensee Prison. The English translation contains reproductions of actual postcards handwritten by the Hampels in S√ºtterlin-like block letters in a clumsy hand. The uneducated Hampels made spelling mistakes and their language was simple, but their message was strong‚Äîenough to terrify those who found the postcards.Dennis Johnson of Melville House said on Charlie Rose that the postcards were full of \\"grammatical mistakes\\", but they were actually spelling mistakes, as evidenced by the samples in the book. In the largely homogenous German society of that era, uneducated Germans didn't use bad grammar, they just constructed simpler sentences and may not have used correct spelling. Nearly all of them were immediately turned in to police or the Gestapo. Fallada was given the Hampels' Gestapo files by Johannes Becher, a poet, novelist and friend of Fallada's, who returned from exile after the war and became president of the cultural organization established by the Soviet military administration in the Soviet sector. In his job to create a new anti- fascist culture, he went through the Nazi files of executed Resistance fighters and then sought authors who would write these stories according to the new anti-fascist model. He gave the Hampels' files to Fallada in autumn 1945 in an effort to help him recover by giving him good subject matter for a book. Fallada, who had many personal problems, including morphine addiction, had been both institutionalized and incarcerated during the Nazi era. He did not at first want to write the story, saying he had not fought back and had even cooperated with the Nazis. However, unlike many writers and intellectuals who fled Nazi Germany, Fallada had felt too attached to the German language and culture to leave, despite the fact that he was urged to flee and had been blacklisted by the Nazis. As a result, he lived through all years of fear, distrust and danger in the daily life of wartime Berlin and the psychological aspect of the Hampels' story intrigued him. He also had an ear for the simple speech of the common worker. A year after receiving the files, in autumn 1946, Fallada wrote Every Man Dies Alone in just 24 days and died a few months later, weeks before the book was published.  Synopsis  The story takes place during World War II in 1940 in Berlin. The book conveys the omnipresent fear and suspicion engulfing Germany at the time caused by the constant threat of arrest, imprisonment, torture and death. Even those not at risk of any of those punishments could be ostracized and unable to find work. Escherich, a Gestapo inspector, must find the source of hundreds of postcards encouraging Germans to resist Adolf Hitler and the Nazis with personal messages such as ‚ÄúMother! The F√ºhrer has murdered my son. Mother! The F√ºhrer will murder your sons too, he will not stop till he has brought sorrow to every home in the world.‚Äù Escherich is under pressure from Obergruppenf√ºhrer Prall to arrest the source or find himself in dire straits. Nearly all those who find the cards turn them in to the Gestapo immediately, terrified they themselves will be discovered having them. Eventually, Escherich finds the postcard writer and his wife, who turn out to be a quiet, working class couple, Otto and Anna Quangel. The Quangels' acts of civil disobedience were prompted by the loss of their only son, who has been killed in action. They are arrested and brought to trial at the Volksgerichtshof, the Nazi \\"People's Court\\", where the infamous Roland Freisler presides. The Quangels are sentenced to death; Otto is soon executed, but Anna dies during an Allied bombing raid, while still on death row.  Reception  Three months after its 2009 English release it became a \\"surprise bestseller\\" in both the US and UK. It was listed on the official UK Top 50 for all UK publishers, a rare occurrence for such an old book. Hans Fallada's 80-year-old son, Ulrich Ditzen, a retired lawyer, told The Observer he was overwhelmed by the latest sales, \\"It's a phenomenon.\\" Primo Levi said it is \\"the greatest book ever written about German resistance to the Nazis.\\"  Translations  The novel remained untranslated in English until 2009 when it was rediscovered by American publishing house Melville House Publishing and released in the US under the title Every Man Dies Alone, in a translation by Michael Hofmann. Melville House licensed it to Penguin Books in the UK, who used the title Alone in Berlin, following the French translation by Andr√© Vandevoorde in 1967, Seul dans Berlin.Seul dans Berlin at WorldCat. The US title is close to the original German title, which translates verbatim as \\"Everyone dies for himself alone\\". The book was first translated in 1948 into Russian (–ò–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–∞—è –ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞, –ö–∞–∂–¥—ã–π —É–º–∏—Ä–∞–µ—Ç –≤ –æ–¥–∏–Ω–æ—á–∫—É, a second edition on the basis of the uncensored manuscript –û–¥–∏–Ω –≤ –ë–µ—Ä–ª–∏–Ω–µ 2017) and into Swedish (En mot alla, a second edition on the basis of the uncensored manuscript Ensam i Berlin 2012).

Screen adaptations  The earliest adaption was the West German television film Jeder stirbt f√ºr sich allein (1962) directed by Falk Harnack which aired on station SFB. In 1970, an East German television miniseries Jeder stirbt f√ºr sich allein was directed by Hans-Joachim Kasprzik and produced by DEFA. The West German film Jeder stirbt f√ºr sich allein was directed by Alfred Vohrer in 1975, released internationally in English as Everyone Dies Alone in 1976; and in 2004, it was produced as a three-part television miniseries in the Czech Republic. In 2012, the film rights were acquired by Vincent P√©rez and Stefan Arndt. The film adaptation Alone in Berlin was first screened at the Berlin Film Festival in February 2016. The film starred Emma Thompson as Anna Quangel, Brendan Gleeson as Otto Quangel, and Daniel Br√ºhl as Escherich. The director was Vincent P√©rez. The film received a score of 52 on the critical aggregator website Metacritic, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

It is built to withstand vacuum, rather than pressure, abrasion, and heat. Conversely, hard suction is capable of withstanding up to 200 PSIG, as well as vacuum. In the United States, it is standard equipment according to the National Fire Protection Association standards for fire engines. It is used in both structural and wildland firefighting throughout the world, and is made in various diameters and connection types.  Usage  Flexible suction hose, also known as a suction hose, is a specific type of rigid fire hose used in drafting operations. When using this technique, the fire engine draws water for fire fighting from an unpressurized supply, such as a portable water tank, pool, or other static water source, instead of drawing water from a pressurized water supply, such as a fire hydrant. Under complete vacuum conditions, a pump would lift water , however pumps on fire apparatus are not capable of producing a perfect/ total vacuum. Due to this limitation and friction loss, fire services do not recommend attempting to lift water more than . Hard suction hose may also be used to connect a fire engine to a hydrant, due to its ability to handle both vacuum and pressure. This practice is common in Australia, but woven jacket fire hose is normally used for this purpose in the United States. Using hard suction hose in this manner requires that the fire engine be positioned carefully for the limited flexibility of the hose, and may require multiple firefighters due to the weight and bulk of the hose section. The use of flexible suction in this capacity is both ineffective and hazardous, as the hose and couplings may experience catastrophic failure. In certain circumstances, it may be possible to use hard suction hose to draft from a hydrant with adequate water supply but a low flow rate. Flexible suctions are built to withstand vacuum, rather than water pressure, abrasion, and heat. They are, therefore, constructed differently from the standard fire hose and have different end fittings. In the United States, they are standard equipment according to the National Fire Protection Association standards for fire engines. Since neither hard suction nor flexible suction hose can be folded, it is typically mounted on the side of a fire engine, often opposite ground ladders. Such hose is used in both structural and wildland firefighting throughout the world. Hard suction hose can also be used to extend the range of a water tender's dumping capability, if the fittings of the hard suction hose match those of the tender dumping water. This could be used to fill a portable dump tank not immediately adjacent to the water tender, from which another fire engine can draft. Since water movement during dumping relies on gravity, rather than mechanical pressurization, hard suction hose is useful for this task.  Characteristics and construction  Suction hose differs from standard fire hose in both its construction and usage: #Hard suction generally has a black opaque wrapped or laminated outer jacket surrounding a flat stock coil spring core. The inner and outer linings provide maximum rigidity, allowing it to be used up to 200 PSIG pressure as well as under vacuum. Flex suction is less rigid and generally corrugated in profile. Often, such hose is manufactured using molded clear or translucent synthetic material (such as PVC) shaped into a series of rings. Construction methods include heat shrinking the material over round stock coil spring core. This shape allows the hose to be somewhat flexible, without allowing it to collapse on itself under suction, as a normal, woven-jacket fire hose would. #It uses suction gaskets. Gaskets in standard fire hose (\\"pressure gaskets\\") are designed to minimize the water leaking out between couplings. The gaskets connecting hard suction hose sections, pump, and strainer must instead prevent air from entering at the coupling, since that would spoil the vacuum and allow air into the pump intake. \\"Suction gaskets have a flap on the outer rim, facing the outside. The coupling torque to assemble mating suction couplings is higher so that these flaps on mating couplings are pressed together initially, sealing out the outside air, so that the draft can be started.\\" Large diameter ( or greater) hard suctions most often employ National Standard threaded brass connections while flex suction hose will typically use Storz fittings, which are genderless. or smaller hard suction hose will typically use threaded fittings. In each case, the hard suction hose connection will match the fittings of the pump intake and supply hose, so that hard suction hose can be used in place of supply hose as appropriate. #It is short. Typically, suction hose comes in lengths, while fire hose comes in lengths. Since a fire engine's pump only produces a partial vacuum, it is only recommended for lifting water or less. For this reason, and because each junction is an opportunity for a crack or imperfect seal to spoil the vacuum, it is rare to see many sections of hard suction hose connected together. #It is not designed for use in fire streams. The airtight nature of hard suction hose, necessary for drafting, renders the hose unsuitable for the high pressure water flow needed to spray a pressurized stream of water on a fire. \\"Positive pressure requirements for hard suction hose were deleted as using hard suction hose for positive pressures is not a practical application.\\" Thus, suction hose is tested for the ability to \\"prevent collapse under vacuum conditions\\" rather than its ability to function as an attack hoseline. Hard suction hose predates steam or gas powered fire engines and has been available since at least 1888, sometimes referred to as \\"spiral suction hose\\". Modern apparatus are commonly equipped with flexible suction as opposed to hard suction, due to the relative ease of use associated with flexibility, as well as the increasing rarity of employing suction hoses to pressurized water sources.  Diameter  Suction hose comes in multiple sizes, from in diameter. Large diameter hose are carried on full- size fire engines, but smaller diameters of hard suction hose can be carried on apparatus with smaller fire pump ratings, such as wildland fire engines. In the United States, NFPA 1901 requires engines to have suction hose that matches the engine's pump rating. For example, an engine with a per minute pump is required to carry or larger hose, while a wildland fire engine will typically carry hard suction hose. The United Kingdom, has a standardised range of metric hose diameters: 7, 9, 12.5 and 15 cm (2.8, 3.5, 4.9 and 5.9 in), with the two smallest diameters sometimes used twined to provide adequate flow rates.HM Fire Service Inspectorate (2001). Chapter 7: \\"Pre-Planning\\" in: Fire Service Manual, Volume 1, Fire Service Technology, Equipment and Media: Hydraulics, Pump and Water Supplies. London: the Stationery Office. . Within this range, the hoses are fitted with \\"Instantaneous Couplings\\"; the hoses have Storz couplings; and the hose comes in two types, one with \\"Instantaneous Couplings\\" and one with Storz fittings. Fire Service Manuals provide tables of maximum volumetric flow rates for a given pump pressure, hose diameter and total hose length. The use of these tables, is to facilitate the selection of suitable hoses, taking into account the frictional losses caused by transporting water through the strainer, hoses, pump and fire fighting nozzles, to draft water from source to the fireground. Strainers Strainer with Storz fitting Strainer on a diameter hard suction hose When being used in a drafting operation from a pool, portable water tank, or other uncovered water source, the length of suction hose farthest from the pump is usually attached to a strainer, to keep foreign objects in the water from being pulled into and damaging the pump. If used in a pond, stream, or other body of water, an appropriate flotation device must be used to keep the strainer below the surface and above the bottom, so that neither mud nor air are sucked into the fire engine's pump. Industry accepted standard is to maintain two feet of distance from the water's surface, bottom, or any other obstruction. The United Kingdom official guidance is to:HM Fire Service Inspectorate (2001).

E. Hughes, was an Irish-born New Zealand philosopher and logician whose principal scholarly works were concerned with modal logic and medieval philosophy. Biography Hughes was born on 8 June 1918 in Waterford city, Ireland. His English parents George James Hughes and Gertrude Sparks moved to Scotland in the early 1920s, as a result of the Irish War of Independence. George graduated MA with First Class Honours in Philosophy and English, and then in pure Philosophy, from the University of Glasgow. He then studied for a year at the University of Cambridge, before being called back to Glasgow as an assistant lecturer. Subsequently, he held lectureships at the University College of South Wales at Cardiff, and then the University College of North Wales at Bangor. In 1951 he was appointed to the first Chair in Philosophy at the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, a position from which he retired in 1984. He died in Wellington on 4 March 1994. Career Notable influences on Hughes' philosophical development included John Wisdom and Ludwig Wittgenstein, from whom he took classes at Cambridge; J. L. Austin, a leading exponent of ordinary language philosophy; and Arthur Prior, with whom he found much in common when they met in New Zealand. Hughes was a gifted and revered teacher who played a prominent role in academic affairs at Victoria University. He is well remembered for his passion for clarity, his uncompromising intellectual honesty, and his humanity and gentleness.See the Obituary. His early interests were in ethics and the philosophy of religion, but he is most widely known for books on modal logic co-authored with his colleague and former student Max Cresswell. In 1968 they published An Introduction to Modal Logic, the first modern textbook in the area. This book, which has been translated into German, Italian, Japanese and Spanish, was influential in introducing many generations of students and researchers to Kripke semantics, a mathematical theory of meaning that revolutionised the study of modal logics and led to applications ranging from the semantics of natural languages to reasoning about the behaviour of computer programs. Vaughan Pratt, the creator of dynamic logic, has written in reference to his own motivation that \\"a weekend with Hughes and Cresswell convinced me that a most harmonious union between modal logic and programs was possible\\".Vaughan R. Pratt (1980), p. 258. Hughes' other special interest was in medieval philosophical logic, where his main projects were the preparation of philosophical commentaries on Latin manuscripts of John Buridan and Paul of Venice, as well as English translations of the originals. He was also a priest in the Anglican (Episcopal) Church, having been ordained in Bangor Cathedral in 1950. At that time there was a need for clergy who could conduct services in both Welsh and English, so the then Bishop of Bangor ordained several men whom he considered suitable, but who had not had the usual theological training. Hughes had a flair for languages that enabled him to quickly learn how to pronounce the set words of the service even though he was not a Welsh speaker. He was married with five children. His wife Beryl Hughes (1920 ‚Äì 2015), an historian, taught in the History Department of Victoria University for 25 years, and was one of the founders of the Women's Studies programme there.

Max warns Vera that the sisters watch their victims for three days, and if they do anything that the sisters find evil or bad, that person is then murdered. Max then asks Vera if he can sleep at her house for the night. She agrees and takes him to her door, where she closes the door when he is outside, he yells at her and bangs on the door. He then runs away and is killed at what seems to be a train-yard. Vera (seemingly distressed) then calls over some of her friends Anna (Jekaterina Shcheglova), Anton (Michael Dementiev), Nikita (Nikita Emshanov), Stepan (Michael Efimov) and Rita (Ravshana Kurkova) and tells them the story. She wakes up the next morning and dies sometime through the course of the day (the viewer never finds out how she died). Her friends then meet for lunch and discuss that they must try to be as good as possible for the next 3 days. They all go about this in different ways. Anna spends her time trying to find out about the whole story, and try to stop the sisters. Rita, goes about her days normally, while being as nice to people as she can (she ends up being 'bad' in that she sells an apartment to a couple in which a mad man murdered his family, and dies by being impaled by a giant tree trunk). Stepan covers his walls in Holy Cross' and throws out all his alcohol and pornography (he at the end finds out that he gave some wrong information to one of his colleagues, by accident, he dies by being crushed by a bull somehow (the film techniques don't make his death very clear)). Nikita tells all the local district about the ghosts (as he works for a radio station, it is unclear if everyone then becomes haunted by the ghosts, it would seem not though) (he is just generally bad to random people on the street, and dies in a mysterious way, possibly from his stomach exploding). Anton tries to be nice to people, it is not certain how he is seen as evil by the sisters, possibly because he goes to a party on the last day (doing drugs etc.) he is killed by a tornado of darts all flying around him, stabbing into him into him slowly killing him. Anna eventually finds out that there is a fourth sister (Yelena Morozova), and upon visiting her, the sister says nothing other than that she has left her old life behind, Anna gives the fourth sister her number and says she is expecting her to call. The next day the fourth sister calls Anna, and gives her the dress of the daughters' mother (this is what causes them to not kill her). After her friends all die, Anna then puts on the dress of the mother, and is briefly possessed by her spirit, the spirit speaks through her telling the daughters to leave this world.

He is also well regarded by Tibetans as a scholar, poet and artist. Life Karma Thinley Rinpoche was born in Nangchen, Kham, in Qinghai in 1931. At age two, he was recognized as a reincarnation of Beru Shaiyak Lama Kunrik. Throughout the 1950s, Rinpoche made pilgrimages to Radeng, Samye, Sakya and Lhasa. Eventually, he settled for a period at Tsurphu Monastery, traditional seat of the Karmapa. The 16th Karmapa recognized Rinpoche as a tulku of Karma Thinleypa. Karma Thinley Rinpoche left Tibet for India in 1959 and during the 1960s was abbot of the Young Lamas Home School and Karma Drubgyu Thargay Ling nunnery both founded by Freda Bedi in Dalhousie, HP. There he was one of the first Tibetan refugee Lamas to teach western students. In 1971 he accompanied a group of Tibetan refugees resettled in Ontario, Canada as their Lama and in 1973 established a Buddhist center, Kampo Gangra Drubgyud Ling meditation centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In 1982, Karma Tinley Rinpoche was able to visit his homeland Nangchen for the first time since leaving a quarter of a century earlier. Returning several times since then he has established a temple in Shorda, capital of Nangchen District and a school for nomad children in the Sangshung valley. In 1988, he also established a nunnery, Tekchen Lekshay Ling, at Boudhanath Nepal and subsequently a small meditation retreat center at Pharping. His students include Lama Jampa Thaye, a British Buddhist teacher who is Karma Thinley Rinpoche's dharma-regent and founded the Dechen sangha and the Nepalese Lama, Rana Guru.

He was previously the Director of BBC Television from 2013 to 2015.\\"Danny Cohen named as new BBC director of television\\", BBC News, 23 April 2013 Before that, he was the Controller of BBC One for three years, the BBC's principal television channel in the United Kingdom and the youngest person to be appointed as controller of the channel. During his time at the BBC, he commissioned programmes such as Poldark, Doctor Who, Strictly Come Dancing, EastEnders and The Graham Norton Show, and led BBC One's coverage of the 2012 London Olympics.  Education  Cohen was born in Westminster, the son of middle-class Jewish intellectuals. He attended a local Jewish primary school in north London, followed by the City of London School, an independent school for boys in the City of London. Cohen read English at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, from which he graduated with a Double First in English Literature.  Career = Channel 4  Between 2000 and 2007, Cohen worked at Channel 4 and its youth service E4. His roles there included Head of Documentaries for Channel 4 and Head of E4. Cohen's television commissions in this period included Skins, The Inbetweeners, Fonejacker, Supernanny and the documentary strand Cutting Edge.  Controller of BBC Three  Between May 2007 and October 2010, Cohen was the Controller of BBC Three. During his tenureship of BBC Three, the channel increased its share of 16-34-year-old viewers by 58% and won Digital Channel of the Year at the Edinburgh International TV Festival in two out of three years ‚Äì 2008 and 2010. His BBC Three commissions included Our War, the BAFTA nominated Blood, Sweat and T-shirts and follow-up series Blood, Sweat and Takeaways, The Undercover Princes, Britain's Missing Top Model, The World's Strictest Parents, The Adult Season, Russell Howard's Good News, Young Voter's Question Time, Stacey Dooley Investigates, Lip Service, Lee Nelson's Well Good Show, Being Human. Alongside these commissions, he also acquired Summer Heights High from Australia and built a strong following for US animation Family Guy. He also revamped the hourly bulletins 60 Seconds adding a World News update. In February 2008, The Times newspaper described Cohen as \\"the boy wonder of British television\\". In January 2009, the Royal Television Society's magazine Television wrote an article about Cohen which posed the question of whether \\"the 34-year-old wunderkind\\" would be Director General of the BBC by his early forties.  Controller of BBC One  As Controller of BBC One between 2010 and 2013, Cohen's commissions included: Call The Midwife, Happy Valley, Car- Share, Poldark, The Casual Vacancy, The Voice, Last Tango in Halifax, Eat Well For Less, The Missing and the forthcoming Dickensian and War and Peace. In 2012, BBC One had a record-breaking year with its largest ever growth in peak audience share and its first all-hours audience share growth on record.  Director of BBC Television  In May 2013, Cohen became Director of BBC Television, succeeding Roger Mosey, who had been temporarily in the post since August 2012. In this role Cohen oversaw the BBC's Television Networks (BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Three and BBC Four) and BBC Productions ‚Äì Europe's largest television production group. He also had responsibility for the BBC's feature film unit, BBC Films, and the BBC's content on its digital platform, BBC iPlayer. In 2014, BBC Television was the most successful UK television network, and in the first quarter of 2015, the BBC's main network, BBC One, delivered its best start to the year in a decade with a prime-time audience share of 25.2%. In October 2015, Cohen announced that he was leaving the BBC to pursue a new leadership challenge. On the announcement of his departure, the Director-General of the BBC, Tony Hall, said: \\"Danny has done an extraordinary job over the last eight years at the BBC. In a world of intense competition and choice, he has further enhanced the BBC's reputation for quality programming that is full of ambition and creativity... and has also made an outstanding contribution to comedy and entertainment\\".  President of Access Entertainment  In May 2016, Cohen launched Access Entertainment with the industrialist Len Blavatnik. The company has set out an ambition to be 'one of the world's leading independent investors in the entertainment media sector...with a concentration in high-quality television, films and theatrical productions'. The company aims to invest 'several hundred million dollars in the initial phase'.  Controversies =Jimmy Savile and Pollard report The Pollard review into Newsnights decision to drop an investigation into sex abuse claims against Jimmy Savile found that Cohen had not read emails that had been copied to him warning of Savile's \\"dark side\\" and which indicated there was knowledge within the BBC of the unsavoury side of Savile's character. Had he done so \\"it was at least possible that further questions [on the advisability of running the Christmas 2011 tributes] would have followed\\".  Jeremy Clarkson  The former BBC presenter, Jeremy Clarkson, has been highly critical of Mr Cohen, stating: \\"Everybody thinks that the BBC was a bloody nightmare. It wasn‚Äôt. Cohen was. The BBC was brilliant to work for until the arrival of Mr Cohen. They never really interfered at all. But he was a bloody nuisance and caused me an enormous amount of stress\\". Clarkson was further aggravated when exploratory talks surfaced between Cohen and Amazon in relation to Amazon Video's movements in Europe. In early 2016, it was said there was a chance Cohen could have become Clarkson's boss on the factual entertainment series The Grand Tour.  Personal life  Cohen is married to economist and author Noreena Hertz. They were married in 2012 at the Bevis Marks Synagogue in the City of London, in a ceremony conducted by Lord Sacks, the Chief Rabbi, and attended by guests including Rachel Weisz, Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi. They live in Primrose Hill, London. In 2014, in an interview Cohen said that he had \\"never felt so uncomfortable as a Jew in the UK\\".

The piano version was published in 1911, and an orchestral version was published in 1912. The title was chosen in homage to Franz Schubert, who had released collections of waltzes in 1823 entitled Valses nobles and Valses sentimentales. The piano edition is published with a quotation of Henri de R√©gnier: \\"‚Ä¶le plaisir d√©licieux et toujours nouveau d'une occupation inutile\\" (the delicious and forever-new pleasure of a useless occupation). The suite contains an eclectic blend of Impressionist and Modernist music, which is especially evident in the orchestrated version.  Composition and background  Ravel was intrigued by the waltz genre. By 1906 he had started composing what later would become La valse, in which he tried to epitomise everything this popular genre encompassed. In 1911, prior to the 1919 publication of La valse, he published the piano version of his suite of eight Valses nobles et sentimentales. The work was first performed on May 8, 1911 by Louis Aubert, to whom the work is dedicated, at a performance of new works where the composers were not identified. It was sponsored by the Soci√©t√© musicale ind√©pendante, to promote the works of more adventurous composers, without \\"burdening\\" critics with the attached labels of authorship. This was in theory supposed to encourage the critics to evaluate what they actually heard rather than simply judging the piece by the name of the composer. The anonymous work generated a disturbing chorus of boos and cat calls.http://fordcenter.blogspot.com/2009/11/program-information-for-iris- orchestra.html Many were unnerved by the acerbic harmonic palette that he employed. Some even thought the piece was a parody. When the votes were tallied, the nominated composers included Erik Satie, Charles Koechlin, Vincent d'Indy and even Zolt√°n Kod√°ly, but \\"a minute majority,\\" Ravel recalled, \\"ascribed the paternity of the Valses to me.\\" The rest of the concert included works by Antoine Mariotte, L√©o Sachs, D√©sir√©-√âmile Inghelbrecht, Henri B√ºsser, √âdouard Mignan, Hector Fraggi, Lucien Wurmser and Fran√ßois Couperin. The following year an orchestrated version of the Valses was published. This work indicated that the composer wanted to create a \\"clearer\\" orchestral sound than had been the case for the preceding Ma m√®re l'Oye. Trouhanowa and Bekefi in Ad√©la√Øde, 1912 The orchestrated ballet version of the Valses nobles et sentimentales was named Ad√©la√Øde, ou le langage des fleurs (Adelaide: The Language of Flowers). There is a striking resemblance between this story and the plot of Giuseppe Verdi's La traviata based on the novel and play La Dame aux Cam√©lias by Alexandre Dumas, fils.  Structure  That Ravel wanted to identify with Franz Schubert is clear. As he said himself: :The title sufficiently indicates my intention to compose a succession of waltzes, after Schubert's example. However, unlike Schubert (who actually wrote separately-grouped noble and sentimental waltzes that, while originally published separately, are frequently published together), Ravel did not differentiate the noble waltzes from the sentimental ones. Other than the name and the waltz form, there is little similarity between Ravel's and Schubert's works. A typical performance of all eight waltzes takes 15 minutes. They are marked: The orchestral arrangement of the piece is written for an orchestra consisting of two flutes, two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets (in B and A), two bassoons, four horns (in F), two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, tambourine, cymbals, snare drum, glockenspiel, triangle, bass drum, celesta, two harps, and strings.

Life Javier Calvo graduated in journalism at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and studied comparative literature at Pompeu Fabra University. He's married to American writer and photographer Mara Faye Lethem. They have two children. Work=Laugh Tracks His first short-story compilation, Risas enlatadas (Laugh Tracks, 2001), shows stylistic elements that differ extremely from those of contemporary Spanish narrative: sampling or movie snippets, manipulated quotes of other texts, compressed plots from other novels and an \\"open\\" conception of narration, taken from Free Cinema and the montage techniques of filmmakers such as Jean Eustache or John Cassavetes. Other influences, recognizable in this book are the English novel and the audiovisual world of cinema and television, with many of his short stories using the world of television as a theme. The Reflecting God Along the same line of his short story book, the novel El Dios Reflectante (The Reflecting God) was published in 2003. It is the epic-comical chronicle of the shooting of a science fiction film in London and of the many ways that the eccentricity of its director, Matsuhiro Takei, has unpredictable consequences in the life of the film's crew. In the pages of this book, the author repeats the sampling technique, the manipulation of fragments of other movies and the organization of the novel's parts following certain montage sequence techniques. The novel was a unanimous critical success and was immediately translated to Italian and German. The Lost Rivers of London In 2005, he published Los R√≠os Perdidos de Londres (The Lost Rivers of London), his darkest book yet. It comprises four short novels, Una belleza rusa (A Russian Beauty), Crystal Palace, Rosemary and Mary Poppins: los r√≠os perdidos (Mary Poppins: The Lost Rivers). In this book, his style becomes dense and picks up influences not only of Gothic and Victorian narrative, but of Gothic rock and post punk aesthetics. Una belleza rusa is a free version of the Vladimir Nabokov story A Russian Beauty, where he uses characters and elements from the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Crystal Palace is an autobiographic story about the author's relationship with the series Doctor Who during his childhood. Rosemary combines elements from the Roman Polanski movie Rosemary's Baby with the history of the band The Cure. And Los r√≠os perdidos is a tribute to the novels of the Mary Poppins series by P.L. Travers and the work of British musician and occultist Jhonn Balance. Wonderful World Mundo Maravilloso (Wonderful World, 2007), more than six-hundred pages long, is a comical thriller set in contemporary Barcelona. The main character, Lucas Giraut, is an antique dealer with emotional problems who gets involved in the world of crime in order to become the person that he believes his father wanted him to be. In order to do so, he associates himself with a group of psychedelic rock fanatical thieves and forgers who call themselves \\"The Down With the Sun Society\\". Mundo maravilloso was a finalist of the Jos√© Manuel Lara Foundation Award of 2008 and has recently been translated to English (Harpercollins, 2009). Wreath His novel Corona de Flores (Wreath, 2010) (Random House-Mondadori, 2010), is a Gothic crime novel, set in 19th century Barcelona. The Hanging Garden The Hanging Garden (El jard√≠n colgante) won the 2012 Premio Biblioteca Breve for best unpublished novel. Cinema Javier Calvo collaborates regularly as screenwriter with the film director Roger Gual. Together they wrote the screenplays of Remake (Ovideo TV, 2005) and Gual's third feature film Tasting Menu (Subotica Entertainment, 2013). Style and Influences Javier Calvo's style has been described as \\"post- urban grotesque\\" by Spanish critic Julio Ortega. Among his literary influences are Jane Austen, E. M. Forster, Aleister Crowley, Pamela Lyndon Travers, B. S. Johnson, Juan Benet, Joan Perucho, J. G. Ballard, Iain Sinclair, Roberto Bola√±o and Rodrigo Fres√°n. Cinematic influences include David Lean, Jean Eustache, Alan Clarke and Mike Leigh.

The band refers to its own style as \\"Electronic poetry\\".Manuela Orth ¬∑ New Life Music magazine ¬∑ Issue 12/96 ¬∑ Interview with Chandeen ¬∑ December 1996 From the middle of the 1990s, the band's style changed to a more pop-oriented sound with influences from rock and trip hop. History Chandeen was founded in 1990 by Harald L√∂wy and Oliver Henkel, who had been working on musical experiments together from the winter of 1989. The name comes from a pet iguana owned by a friend of L√∂wy. In 1991 Aline Akbari joined, and additional singer Antje Schulz joined in 1992. After two cassette releases, they came to the attention of Hyperium Records head Oliver R√∂sch, who signed them. Aline Akbari left the group shortly before the signing and was replaced by Catrin Mallon. Under this lineup they recorded their first two full-lengths, Shaded by the Leaves and Jutland. In the process of the studio work for Jutland, internal differences arose between the members, and Catrin Mallon and Oliver Henkel left the group in 1994. The pair went on to collaborate on the project Edera, which produced only one album (1996's Ambiguous) before dissolving. New singer Stephanie H√§rich joined for the 1995 EP Light Within Time, taking Mallon's place. She had previously worked with Harald L√∂wy on the project Incept Date, singing background vocals on their Archipelago album in 1994. After several releases on Hyperium, the group separated from that label and began releasing on Synthetic Symphony, a sublabel of SPV GmbH. Their 1998 single \\"Skywalking\\" was broadcast on MTV Europe and VIVA, and the band made appearances on NBC Giga, but the exposure did not bring them widespread success.Markus Vennemann ¬∑ Entry Music magazine ¬∑ Interview with Chandeen ¬∑ Online article ¬∑ 2002Lars Schmidt ¬∑ Ragazzi Music magazine ¬∑ Interview with Chandeen ¬∑ Online article ¬∑ 2002 Harald L√∂wy created his own independent label, Kalinkaland, in 2001, which became the primary vehicle for the release of Chandeen's music. Several further releases followed before the group broke up. In 2007 L√∂wy reactivated the project, releasing a new album, Teenage Poetry, in 2008. Julia Beyer joined for this release. Furthermore there was an additional steady band member with Mike Brown, who died in 2012.RIP Mike Brown of Livewire Electronics 2011 saw the release of their album Blood Red Skies, followed by Forever And Ever in 2014. Trivia ;Artists * Harald L√∂wy founded a second project Incept Date besides Chandeen with which he released the two albums Archipelago (1994) and Harem (1996). Together with Chandeen guest musician Ion Javelin (former singer of Moskwa TV) Harald L√∂wy initiated the project Broken Surface. From this collaboration emanated the album Broken Surface and the single Generator X.0.7/8. Additionally Harald L√∂wy was active for neoclassic formation Stoa, with whose singer Antje Buchheiser he is in a relationship. A long-term friendship also connects him with Steffen Keth, the singer of De/Vision, who also supported Chandeen for live performances. * Some Chandeen albums were produced by Axel Henninger, who made a name for himself in the German electropop scene as producer for bands like Camouflage (band) and Moskwa TV. * The album Forever And Ever, released in 2014, was mastered in collaboration with the New Yorker music and mastering studio The Lodge under the direction of Grammy nominee Emily Lazar. * Besides his commitment for Chandeen, Mike Brown was also the founder and engineer of the synthesizer company Livewire Electronics, whose modules are being used by bands like M83Stereogum ¬∑ M83 With The Los Angeles Philharmonic @ Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles 3/7/09 or Nine Inch Nails.Emusician.com ¬∑ Interview with NIN keyboarder Alessandro Cortini Members ;Current *Julia Beyer - vocals, songwriting *Harald L√∂wy - music, production, songwriting ;Former *Mike Brown - music, production, songwriting (‚Ä†2012) *Aline Akbari - vocals, songwriting (1991‚Äì93) *Catrin Mallon - vocals, songwriting (1993‚Äì94) *Stephanie H√§rich - vocals, songwriting (1995‚Äì2002) *Oliver Henkel - music (1990‚Äì2004) *Antje Schulz - vocals, songwriting (1992‚Äì2004) ;Collaborators *Michael Schwalm - management, photography, artwork, production *Dorothea Hohnstedt - flute *Ion Javelin - vocals, songwriting *Harald Gottschalk - guitar *Florian Walther - guitar *Axel Henninger - guitar, production *Antje Buchheiser - programming *Phillip Ritmannperger - drums (for live performances) *Steve Roach - remixer (1995) *Daniel Myer - remixer (1998) *Steffen Keth - remixer (2002) *Klive Humberstone - remixer (2002) *Nigel Humberstone - remixer (2002) *Anji Bee - vocals, songwriting (2008) Discography { width=\\"100%\\"  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" Albums & EPs * 1994 - Shaded by the Leaves (CD, Hyperium Records) * 1995 - Jutland (CD, Hyperium Records) * 1995 - Light Within Time (EP + CD- ROM Video, Hyperium Records) * 1996 - The Waking Dream (CD, Hyperium Records) * 1998 - Spacerider - Love at First Sight (CD, Synthetic Symphony) * 2002 - Bikes and Pyramids (CD, Kalinkaland Records) * 2003 - Echoes (CD, Kalinkaland Records) * 2008 - Teenage Poetry (CD, Kalinkaland Records) * 2011 - Blood Red Skies (CD, Kalinkaland Records) * 2014 - Forever And Ever (CD/Vinyl, Kalinkaland Records  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" Singles & Maxis * 1994 - \\"Red Letter Days\\"/\\":Lumis:\\" (MCD, Hyperium Records) * 1995 - \\"Strawberry Passion\\" (MCD, Hyperium Records) * 1996 - \\"Papillon (It's Easy to Fly)\\" (MCD, Hyperium Records) * 1998 - \\"Spacerider\\" (MCD, Synthetic Symphony) * 1999 - \\"Skywalking\\" (MCD, Synthetic Symphony) * 2002 - \\"My World Depends on You\\" (MCD, Out Now Records) } { width=\\"100%\\"  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" Collections * 1998 - A Taste Like Ginger (CD, Cleopatra Records) * 2004 - Pandora's Box (CD, Kalinkaland Records)  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" Demos * 1992 - The Twilight Crossing - Part I (K7) * 1993 - The Twilight Crossing - Part II (K7) } { width=\\"100%\\"  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" Videos * 1998 - Skywalking (Videoclip) * 2011 - Shadows Fade (Videoclip) * 2014 - The Wild Unknown (Videoclip) * 2015 - Wake Up, Starbuck (Videoclip)  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" } ReferencesExternal links * Chandeen ‚Äì Homepage of the band * Chandeen at Discogs * [ Chandeen] at Allmusic * Interview - Teenage Poetry at MichaelFloydsMusic Category:German dark wave musical groups ","title":"Chandeen"},{"id":"18735077","text":"The Low Islands are one of the many uninhabited Canadian arctic island groups in Qikiqtaaluk Region, Nunavut.

Biography Sawer was born in Stockport, England. After attending Ipswich School, he studied music at the University of York where he began composing for contemporary music-theatre pieces. He directed the UK premieres of Mauricio Kagel's Kantrimiusik and Mare Nostrum at the ICA, conducted the UK premiere of Szenario, and appeared as solo performer in Phonophonie at the South Bank Centre, London, and in the world premiere of Harrison Birtwistle's Gawain at the Royal Opera House. In 1984 he won a DAAD scholarship to study with Mauricio Kagel in Cologne. Even from this point his career, Sawer's music tends to define each piece within theatrical terms. Indeed, Sawer has described himself as a \\"theatre person\\". His works often reference the visual arts, and in particular surrealist imagery. For example, his piano piece, The Melancholy of Departure was inspired by the shadowy and irrational perspectives of a De Chirico painting. In 1992 Sawer was awarded the Fulbright-Chester-Schirmer-Scholarship; he won a Paul Hamlyn Foundation Award in 1993, an Arts Foundation Fellowship in 1995 and a residence with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra in 1996. In 2007 he featured in a composer portrait concert as part of the Philharmonia's 'Music of Today' series. He was awarded a Civitella Ranieri Foundation Fellowship in 2006 and a MacDowell Fellowship, taking residence in 2016. He teaches composition at the Royal Academy of Music, London. Sawer has received numerous commissions that have resulted in impressive works for the concert hall, dance, film, theatre and radio.

In dot-voting participants vote on their chosen options using a limited number of stickers or marks with pens ‚Äî dot stickers being the most common. This sticker voting approach is a form of cumulative voting.  Process specifics  The dot- voting process includes the following steps: * Participants are each given a set number of dot stickers (as decided by the facilitator) * They place dot stickers next to options presented that they like (they may place any number of their dots on any number of the options) * Options with the most dots at the end of voting ‚Äúwin‚Äù Variations include: * using different colour dots to signify different values, e.g. green for \\"like\\" and red for \\"dislike\\". * using different colour dots for different types of participants e.g. blue for management and red for staff.  History  The origins of dot-voting are unclear. Professional facilitators are said to have been using it since the 1980s. Dot-voting is now widely used for making quick collaborative decisions by teams adopting agile and lean methodologies. For example, it is one of the methods endorsed by the 18F digital services agency of the United States' General Services Administration, and is part of the Design Sprint methodology.  Benefits  Dot-voting is a quick and simple method for prioritizing a long list of options. It‚Äôs less cognitively demanding than having to perform full ranking of all the options, because participants are not required to give a comparative judgment of each option, and it allows participants to express a preference for more than one option at the same time. It also creates a sense of engagement and allows participants to see the decision process in action and understand how the final choice was made. Criticism Dot-voting has been criticized for limiting creativity and diversity of ideas, and giving confusing or false results. Dot-voting is like a one question multiple-choice survey done with stickers. Participants are expected to review, consider and compare all options before sticking their dots. As a result, too many options can be overwhelming (see overchoice) and thus facilitators are encouraged to amalgamate and generalize unique ideas into broader and less specific concepts. New options cannot be added once dotting has started, as this would not be fair to the new additions. Similar or related options are penalized, as these can cause vote-splitting. Participants can easily cheat by adding extra dots, peeling off dots or moving dots. Often people will simply add their dots where everyone else has dotted, without considering their own opinion on all the options, thus an example of the Bandwagon effect. It is also impossible to tell if a result represent broad popularity (because many people gave one dot), or an enthusiastic minority (where a few people gave many dots). Overall all results are not reliable.

Its head office was in London, Ontario. It marketed itself as \\"Canada's All-Canadian Company\\", and was acquired by BP Canada in 1971. Supertest station in Toronto, ca. 1965 John Gordon Thompson (1894-1982), an operator of automobile service centres and manufacturer of tire repair and gasoline pumps, formed London Automotive Service Ltd. with James D. Good on 13 March 1923. They purchased the assets of the Energy Oil Company for $10,000. Energy Oil Company owned a run-down gas station on Dundas St. E. in London, Ontario, a bulk storage plant in London, and two fuel delivery tank trucks. Thompson was elected president and Good was named vice-president and secretary/treasurer. They adopted \\"Supertest\\" as the trademark name of their gasoline. On 23 May 1923, Supertest opened it first gasoline station at 362 Dundas Street E. Gas sold for 31 cents/gallon), and the station sold Mobiloil lubricants. The new company was not a refiner and sourced its gasoline and oil from Imperial Oil Ltd. In 1924, Supertest opened subsidiary companies in Hamilton and Ottawa. On 17 December 1925, Supertest Petroleum Corporation, Limited was incorporated. A subsidiary was formed in St. Thomas, Ontario. Bulk distributing plants were opened in Glencoe, Wingham and Seaforth, Ontario. In 1926, Supertest bought the Ensign Oil Company of Montreal, opened a bulk distributing plant at Port Robinson, Ontario, and amalgamated all of the subsidiaries companies into one major company known as \\"Supertest Petroleum Corporation Limited\\". Supertest registered the trademark \\"Hi Compression\\" for its new gasoline. In 1928, a tank ship, the M.S. Supertest, was put into operation. It made deliveries to Kingston, Ottawa and Montreal until it was sold shortly after World War II. In 1932, Supertest registered the trademark \\"Wonder Gasoline\\". From 1928 to 1936, the company opened new divisions and established bulk plants throughout Ontario and Quebec. By 1936, Supertest owned and operated 342 stations with over 800 dealers in Ontario and Quebec and over 5000 consumer accounts. The company had over 100 trucks and 60 automobiles, and employed over 500 people. In 1944, the company sponsored the first \\"Supertest Stake Races\\" harness horse racing. In 1945, it began publishing The Maple Leaf, a company magazine. In 1950 James D. Good Vice President of Supertest Oil died. His home on the southwest corner of Waterloo Street X Epworth Avenue eventually became the music school at the University of Western Ontario. In the mid-1950s, Supertest Petroleum opened an exploration office in Calgary, Alberta. By 1971, Supertest was producing about 3000 barrels per day, or about 10% of the sales of its gas stations In 1966, Supertest sponsored the first Canadian tournament for the Ladies Professional Golf Association, the Supertest Ladies Open, at the Sunningdale Golf Club in London. Fifty of the world's top women golfers competed for the Supertest Trophy. In 1971, Supertest was sold to British Petroleum Canada (BP). The familiar Supertest maple leaf logo was modified to incorporate the BP shield and to drop the \\"All-Canadian\\" slogan. By the end of 1973, the Supertest logo and name had been phased out by BP Canada. In 1983, BP Canada was purchased by Petro-Canada, which was then owned by the Government of Canada. Petro-Canada continued to use the Supertest name in their line of transmission oil lubricants through the year 2000; products since renamed to PRODURO.

It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on May 21, 2000. The episode was written by Chris Carter, and directed by Kim Manners. The episode helped to explore the series' overarching mythology. \\"Requiem\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.9, being watched by 15.26 million viewers in its initial broadcast. The episode received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Many applauded the way it made the series' increasingly marginalized alien mythology relevant again, although others lamented the partial loss of David Duchovny. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully return to the site of their first investigation together when a series of abductions take place. However, Scully's failing health, and Mulder's concern that she is in danger, cause him to take her off the case. Meanwhile, the Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis)‚Äîon his deathbed‚Äîreunites with Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden) and Alex Krycek in an attempt to revive the project. \\"Requiem\\" was a story milestone for the series, featuring the alien abduction of Mulder. Mulder would appear sporadically in the last two seasons, only returning for about half of the episodes in season eight and only two episodes in season nine. Prior to being picked up for another season, however, many believed that the episode would serve as the series finale. As such, many elements from the show's pilot episode were brought in to bring the show closure and help it segue into a movie franchise. Plot In Bellefleur, Oregon, Detective Miles drives to the scene of a reported air crash in the forest. As Miles arrives, his car's electricity cuts out, causing it to crash. After exiting the vehicle, an injured Miles finds his deputy sheriff, Ray Hoese, unconscious in his police cruiser. Miles is suddenly confronted by a man identical to Hoese who is bleeding green fluid, indicating he is an Alien Bounty Hunter. Later, in Tunisia, Marita Covarrubias arranges for the release of Alex Krycek from a penal colony. Upon returning to the United States, the two meet with the wheelchair-bound Smoking Man, who tells them that an alien craft has crashed in Oregon. The Smoking Man sees the crash as a chance to rebuild the Project, but claims that finding it will be complicated. In Oregon, two teenage boys (Gary and Richie) are exploring the crash site when they encounter Detective Miles, who denies any crash or the fire that was reported in the area. While they go through the area on their own, Gary is lifted off the ground and shaken by an invisible force, and Richie, although he stands within a few feet of him, can't see him. Meanwhile, in Washington, Fox Mulder receives a call from Billy Miles, an abductee from Bellefleur whom the agents investigated seven years prior. The younger Miles tells him about Hoese's disappearance, and his concern that the abductions have begun again. The following morning, Mulder and Dana Scully arrive in Bellefleur, where they investigate the road where the incidents took place. Upon meeting Billy, they find he has become a local police officer. The agents also meet \\"Detective Miles\\", unaware that he is a disguised Bounty Hunter who has killed Billy's father. At the scene of Hoese's disappearance, Scully finds three bullet casings, indicating that the deputy fired his weapon before vanishing. The agents later speak with Hoese's wife and are surprised when she is revealed to be Theresa Nemman, one of the other 1992 abductees. Later, while going through case files, Scully becomes ill. That night, Theresa is awakened by someone at her door. Mulder and Scully arrive at her house to find it being investigated by police, with Billy informing them that Theresa was taken in the night and that nobody knows what happened. Scully suddenly feels nauseous, much to Billy's concern, but she quickly shakes it off. Later, while investigating the crash site, Scully is lifted and shaken just as Gary was. Mulder finds her nearly passed out on the ground. Meanwhile, Billy enters his home and pulls his gun on the man who appears to be his father. After the confrontation, Billy relinquishes his gun, at which point the other man physically morphs and reveals himself to be the Bounty Hunter. At that point, Mulder and Scully pull up and walk into the house, unable to locate Billy or his father. When Mulder and Scully return to Washington, Walter Skinner approaches them in their office, where they are joined by Marita and Krycek. Marita reveals that the Smoking Man is dying and that he wants to find the UFO in Oregon to restart the Project. Krycek informs them that the UFO is hidden behind an energy field. The group, along with the Lone Gunmen, find evidence pinpointing the UFO's location. Mulder makes it clear to Scully that he is concerned for her health and refuses to let her accompany him back to Oregon. Reciprocating his concern, Scully refuses to let Mulder return alone; Skinner accompanies Mulder instead. While investigating the incident back in Washington, Scully and the Lone Gunmen find evidence that it was Mulder, not Scully, who would be in danger at the Oregon abduction site. However, immediately upon discovering this, Scully is taken ill, and the Lone Gunmen have her rushed to the hospital. Meanwhile, Mulder and Skinner travel to the woods, equipped with lasers for finding the UFO. Noticing a spot where the lasers cease in mid-air, Mulder walks through the force field. He finds and joins a group of abductees, including Billy and Theresa, standing below a pillar of light from a UFO; they are soon accosted by the Bounty Hunter. Mulder vanishes with the group while a stunned Skinner witnesses the UFO's departure. At the Watergate, Krycek and Marita come to visit the Smoking Man, who is already aware of his plan's failure but is resigned to his fate. With Marita holding back his assistant, Krycek wheels the Smoking Man out of the room and throws him down a flight of stairs, presumably killing him. After being hospitalized, Scully tells Skinner that, although she cannot understand it -- and that it is important that he keep it secret -- she is pregnant. Production=Background and writing right While filming was underway for the seventh season, many members of the crew felt that the show had entered into its final season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later explained that \\"there was a pretty strong sentiment inside and outside the show that it was time to call it a day.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles (2008), p. 180. As the season progressed, however, the idea of producing another season emerged. Paul Rabwin explained that, \\"we found ourselves starting to get energized again. [...] As we got toward the end of the season, everyone was kind of hopeful.\\"Shapiro (2000), p. 277. As such, when it came time to pen \\"Requiem\\", the producers considered several ways to deal with the episode. The first idea was that \\"Requiem\\" could serve a series finale.Shapiro (2000), p. 278. Another idea that emerged was that the episode could end on a cliffhanger, leading into an eighth season or an X-Files movie. The former idea was chosen, leading to series creator Chris Carter writing \\"Requiem\\" as segue into season eight. \\"Requiem\\" attempted to bring closure to several aspects of the series. In one sequence, Alex Krycek throws The Smoking Man down a flight of stairs, presumably to his death. Nicholas Lea, the actor who portrayed Krycek, noted: \\"That's one of the character's great moments, when I get to push Bill Davis down a set of stairs. In a sense, he has nothing to lose because his life's burned out. So death doesn't have the same terror that it would to a young happy chap.\\" The episode also featured several tender moments between Mulder and Scully, which many fans found \\"nearly pornographic in the context of their long, chaste courtship\\", according to Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles in their book The Complete X-Files. Gillian Anderson, however, defended the moments, arguing that there was ample amount of romance between Mulder and Scully prior to \\"Requiem\\". The ending scene, featuring Scully revealing that she is pregnant, was written the day before it was filmed. Carter held it back because he \\"didn't want to create something that would let the cat out of the bag and give anybody the opportunity to spoil our fun.\\" Casting and filming alt=A man with dark brown hair is smirking and looking near the camera. Because there was a chance that the seventh season would be its last, the character of Billy Miles, played by Zachary Ansley and who originally appeared in the pilot episode, was brought back in and featured in \\"Requiem\\" to bring the series full-circle. Ansley would also appear in several eighth season episodes as well. After the conclusion of the episode, David Duchovny expressed his desire to leave the series. He explained, \\"I was kind of a free agent after season seven, and to me, there was not much else to do in terms of the character. So it was really about me wanting to pursue other parts of my career as a writer, director, and actor.\\" Rumors began spreading‚Äîwhich were eventually confirmed‚Äîthat another character would take Mulder's place. Many fans on the internet believed that Mitch Pileggi, who portrayed Walter Skinner, would take the role; Pileggi later called this guess \\"ridiculous.\\" The episode was directed by Kim Manners. Originally, Carter had planned on directing the episode himself, but he eventually felt that it would be better handled by Manners. Manners later noted that he felt \\"very honored\\" by this gesture. Principal shooting for the episode began on Soundstage 5 at the Twentieth Century Fox lot on April 20, 2000. Because large parts of this episode as well as the pilot are supposed to take place in the same fictional city of Bellefleur, Oregon.Shapiro (2000), p. 270. This caused something of an issue, as the pilot had originally been shot on location in Lynn Valley in North Vancouver, British Columbia, in the Lower Seymour Conservation Reserve‚Äîformerly known as the Seymour Demonstration Forest.Gradnitzer and Pittson (1999), pp. 26-27. Since production had moved from Vancouver to Los Angeles after the conclusion of the fifth season, a local California location was needed to stand in for Oregon. Consequently, when the cast and crew of the series finished filming at the Fox lot, they relocated to the Big Bear resort, located near Big Bear Lake, California, which was very evocative of Vancouver, thereby providing an \\"ideal backdrop\\" for the episode. The episode featured several elaborate effects, created through both digital and physical means. The scene in which Scully encounters an alien forcefield was created with the use of a special effects harness. Effects producer Bill Millar created many of the special effects for the episode‚Äîincluding shots of the alien craft as well as its interaction with people‚Äîin a building in Big Bear. The episode contains a shot of Detective Miles morphing into the alien bounty hunter, which required various shots of Leon Russom and Brian Thompson to be spliced together via blue screen technology. Producer Paul Rabwin called the shot in this episode \\"one of the best morphs we've ever done.\\" Themes The scene in Skinner's office is a reference to The Last Supper, a painting by Leonardo da Vinci \\"Requiem\\" explores Mulder's desire to leave his pursuit of the truth behind him. Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X notes that the episode's theme, in a colloquial sense, is Mulder's \\"realization that maybe it's time to get out of the car\\". The irony of the episode, however, is that as soon as Mulder discovers absolute proof of alien life, he is subsequently abducted and taken away.Bush (2008), p. 144. While in Skinner's office, the camera angles and position of the characters recall Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting The Last Supper. Skinner is standing in Saint Peter's spot, and Scully is standing in Judas Iscariot's place. Bush argues that, in this manner, the show is suggesting that Scully, like Judas, directly affects the fate of the savior, in this case Mulder. She notes that Scully's actions result in a fate that \\"could not be realized without her participation\\".Bush (2008), p. 145. This is not the first time Scully has been compared to Judas in the show: the earlier episode \\"The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati\\"‚Äîwhich is heavily based on Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation of Christ‚Äîfeatures Scully in a role with direct literary parallels to Kazantzakis's heroic interpretation of Judas.Donaldson (2007), p. 19. Reception=Ratings \\"Requiem\\" first aired on Fox in the United States on May 21, 2000. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 8.9, with a 14 share, meaning that roughly 8.9 percent of all television-equipped households, and 14 percent of households watching television, were tuned into the episode. It was viewed by 15.26 million viewers.Shapiro (2000), p. 281. \\"Requiem\\" marked a 3.8 percent decrease in viewers from the sixth season finale, \\"Biogenesis\\" and a 14.4 percent decrease from the seventh season premiere, \\"The Sixth Extinction.\\" The episode aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 on August 13, 2000, and received 1.00 million viewers, making it the most watched episode that week. Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e August 6‚Äì13, 20000\\", listed under Sky 1 On May 13, 2003, the episode was released on DVD as part of the complete seventh season. Two years later the episode was included on The X-Files Mythology, Volume 3 ‚Äì Colonization, a DVD collection that contains episodes involving the alien colonists. Reviews The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B+\\". She argued that the episode was \\"the best season finale cliffhanger the show ever did\\", and compared it to the second season finale \\"Anasazi\\"; she noted that while the latter episode was \\"pretty amazing\\", \\"Requiem\\" has \\"a finality\\" to it and a \\"sense that nothing will ever be the same\\" that made its cliffhanger ending work. VanDerWerff also wrote that the references to the pilot episode helped to show how far the series had evolved in seven years. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review. Despite lamenting the loss of Fox Mulder, he noted that \\"the truth is The X-Files has been a show like no other and 'Requiem' proved once again there truly is a place for magic and beauty and love on the small screen and I am delighted to have witnessed it for seven seasons now.\\"Kessenich (2002), p. 141. Kessenich later named the episode one of the \\"Top 25 Episode of All Time\\" of The X-Files, ranking it at number 20.Kessenich (2002), p. 217. Kenneth Silber from Space.com called the episode \\"intriguing\\" and felt that while \\"The X-Files \\"foundered\\" for a large portion of its seventh season, \\"Requiem\\" marked \\"a much-needed return to that mythology,\\" and that it set \\"the stage for what might be an interesting eighth season.\\" Rich Rosell from DigitallyObsessed.com awarded the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that \\"A lot of characters out of the woodwork come back for the season- ending cliffhanger [...] But that's all window-dressing for a trio of big surprises that wrap up Season 7, in what many consider the show's death knell, or perhaps just a proper ending.\\" Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five.Shearman and Pearson (2008), p. 227. The two noted that, despite the fact that it capped-off a \\"lacklustre\\" season, the episode still managed to provide a good enough cliffhanger to hold fans until the premiere of the eighth season. Shearman and Pearson further noted that \\"against the odds, after all the disappointments of the year, 'Requiem' is strong enough to leave its audience wanting more.\\" Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a more mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Despite noting that the episode was \\"the best mytharc episode and season finale in years\\", she called the episode's finale \\"one of the most egregious missteps yet in The X-Files mythology\\".

They included Sah Dipchand of Hissar, an Agrawal Jain, who constructed 16 havelis for his 16 sons in Dariba Kalan, south of Chandni Chowk.Jyotiprasad Jain, Pramukh Jain Etihasik Purush aur mahilayen, Bharatiya Jnanapitha, 1975 According to other accounts he was invited by Shah Alam II and had five sons.Bharat ke Digambar Jain Tirth, Volume 1, Balbhadra Jain, 1974 Harsukh Rai, one of his descendants, was chosen to be the imperial treasurer by Emperor Shah Alam II, and was given the title Raja. Harsukh Rai constructed a large and ornate Jain temple in the Dharampura locality of Old Delhi in 1807 during the rule of Mughal Emperor Akbar II with a cost of about 8 Lakh rupees, then an enormous amount. He was able to obtain the royal permission to construct a shikhara for the temple for the first time during the Mughal rule. Thus temple is known as the Naya Mandir (new temple), since an older Jain temple, now known as the Lal Mandir already existed. When the temple construction was almost finished, Harsukh Rai stopped the construction. When the representatives of the Agrawal Jain community approached him and asked about it, he claimed that he has run out of money and needed donations from the community to finish the construction. After accepting modest donations, Harsukh Rai declared the temple to be panchayati (i.e. belonging to the community, rather than himself) and finished the construction. During the festivities of temple consecration (Panch-kalyanak Pratishtha), the festive pandal was raided by a local group and the gold and silver objects (chhatra, chamar, utensils) were plundered. Harsukh Rai complained to the Emperor, who ordered that they be returned. In Samvat 1867, he wanted to obtain the imperial permission for a rath-yatra (religious procession) that was traditionally prohibited. He had the Sunehri Masjid regilded. As a reward, he asked the emperor permission to have the rath-yatra. He and his son Suganchand built numerous Jain temples at *Patparganj *Hastinapur *Karnal *Sonpat *Hissar *Panipat and *Sanganer The Delhi Rath Yatra During most of the Mughal period, the Jains were prohibited from taking out a religious procession. In 1810, Harsukh Rai was able to obtain the permission of the emperor to have a Jain religious procession. The Rath Yatra caused considerable resentment among the non-Jains and resulted in some disturbances. In 1877, after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Jains (called Sarawagi in the records) again sought permission to take out a permission to take out a procession with \\"50 musicians, one elephant carrying a banner, seven camels bearing flags, fifty palanquins, three chariots ..\\". This was again opposed by other religious groups which warned about \\"riots, looting, murder\\" etc.Jyoti Hosagrahar, \\"Indigenous Modernities, Rutledge, 2005 Eventually the Jains were able to take out the procession, but only through side-streets.

The group consisted of James McClung (guitar), Gary Moon (drums) and Benny Williams (slap bass). They were soon joined by pianist Bill Brown who played on some of their early personal appearances. They were one of the first rock 'n roll bands to record using the name \\"Rebels\\" (February 1, 1958), preceding Duane Eddy's Rebels by at least six months and the \\"Wild Weekend\\" Rebels by more than two years. History The Rebels began their musical career in 1957 while in high school at Duncanville, Texas, joining forces with another classmate and singer Gene Summers. They appeared together on high school assembly programs and soon were playing gigs at the Carswell Air Force Base which at that time was located Northwest of Ft. Worth, Tx. At one of these shows they met a country music comedian nicknamed \\"Cornbread\\" who was appearing on a TV show hosted by Neal Jones on KRLD-TV in Dallas. Cornbread was impressed with Summers and The Rebels and invited them to appear on the TV program. This led them to a regular, weekly spot on another television program, also on KRLD, called \\"Joe Bill's Country Picnic\\" in the fall of 1957. It was while appearing on this show that they were discovered by songwriter Jed Tarver. He wanted them to record his songs \\"Straight Skirt\\", \\"Nervous\\", \\"I'll Never Be Lonely\\", \\"Gotta Lotta That\\" and \\"Twixteen\\". With the assistance of their manager/agent, Thomas Wolverton, Tarver was able to get them an audition with Jan Records, a newly formed Dallas label. Their first release on Jan was on February 1, 1958 and featured Tarver's \\"Straight Skirt\\" composition flipped with an original James McClung song \\"School of Rock 'n Roll\\". \\"Straight Skirt\\" became a regional chart hit and The Rebels found themselves appearing at record hops, concerts and radio and television shows throughout the country. After touring for several months, Williams and Moon decided to pursue other interests and left the band. McClung and Summers replaced them with other musicians and The Rebels continued to perform until 1961. After this, the group disbanded. Summers continued a solo career and was still recording and touring well into the 21st century in both the USA and abroad.  References   * *Solly, Bob.

He was vice-chairman of the Municipal Assembly from 1991 through 17 April 1992.Simiƒá judgement, International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, http://www.un.org/icty/simic/trialc3/judgement/index1.htm War crimes and indictment The Prosecution of the ICTY alleged that on 17 April 1992, Serb military forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina and elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia seized control of the town of Bosanski ≈†amac by force, and within a few days controlled the entire Municipality of Bosanski ≈†amac. The Serbs then announced that the government of the Municipality of Bosanski ≈†amac had been replaced by the ‚ÄúSerbian Municipality of Bosanski ≈†amac‚Äù. Immediately after the forcible takeover, Serb authorities established the ‚ÄúSerbian Municipality of Bosanski ≈†amac Crisis Staff‚Äù, which took the place of the duly-elected municipal assembly and controlled all aspects of the municipal government. The Serb authorities then unlawfully arrested and detained Bosnian Croats, Bosnian Muslims, and other non-Serb civilians; forced many non-Serb residents to leave their homes, and transferred many to other villages where they were detained against their will; expelled and deported them; and required many to participate in forced labour projects and the wide-scale looting of private and commercial property belonging to non-Serbs. The Prosecution highlighted that on or about 17 April 1992 to at least 31 December 1993 Blagoje Simiƒá was appointed President of the Bosanski ≈†amac Crisis Staff, which was renamed the War Presidency on or about 21 July 1992. In these positions he was responsible for issuing orders, policies, decisions and other regulations in the name of the Crisis Staff and War Presidency. It is also alleged that from 1991 to 1995 he was President of the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) in Bosanski ≈†amac; from 1991 to 17 April 1992, Vice-Chairman of the Municipal Assembly; and from 4 November 1991 to at least 30 November 1992, Deputy of the Assembly of the self-declared ‚ÄúSerb Autonomous Region of Northern Bosnia,‚Äù later called the ‚ÄúSerb Autonomous Province of Semberija and Majevica‚Äù. On or about 22 January 1993 he was elected President of the ‚Äú≈†amac Municipal Assembly‚Äù and served in this position until after the announcement of the First Indictment of the ICTY. He was the highest ranking civilian official in the municipality of Bosanski ≈†amac. The Prosecution expressed that from about 17 April 1992 to at least 31 December 1992, Blagoje Simiƒá, both prior to, and while serving as President of the Bosanski ≈†amac Crisis Staff, and as President of the War Presidency, acting in concert with others, planned, instigated, ordered, committed, or otherwise aided and abetted the planning, preparation, or execution of the crime of persecutions. He was additionally charged with persecutions as a crime against humanity, through his participation in the issuance of orders, policies, decisions and other regulations in the name of the Crisis Staff and War Presidency and the authorisation of other official actions which violated the rights of the Bosnian Croats, Bosnian Muslims and other non-Serb civilians to equal treatment under the law and infringed upon their enjoyment of basic and fundamental rights. Blagoje Simiƒá surrendered voluntarily on 12 March 2001 and was transferred on the same day to the ICTY.Trial Watch, Judgement and conviction A conviction is entered for the crime against humanity for persecutions based upon unlawful arrest and detention of Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat civilians, cruel and inhumane treatment including beatings, torture, forced labour assignments, and confinement under inhumane conditions, and deportation and forcible transfer. The Trial Chamber of the ICTY by a majority, Judge Per-Johan Lindholm dissenting, sentenced Blagoje Simiƒá to a sentence of imprisonment for 17 years. Blagoje Simiƒá lodged an appeal against this judgement. On 28 November 2006, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY reduced his sentence to 15 years imprisonment. On 27 March 2007, Simiƒá was transferred to the United Kingdom to serve his sentence.

It provides an opportunity for Amateurs to compete against like-minded groups and to benefit from the adjudication they receive to improve the quality of their performance. The AETF also maintains contact with other leading bodies involved in Amateur Dramatics throughout the United Kingdom by means of its membership of the Central Council for Amateur Theatre, The Drama Festivals Consortium and the British Finals Standing Committee. The festival is also involved with the Geoffrey Whitworth Trophy Competition, in conjunction with the other 'Hosts' of the British Festival, to judge Original, unpublished Scripts that are first produced within the relevant Festivals. History=British Drama League The history of the All-England Theatre Festival dates back to 1919 when the British Drama League was formed. The public inauguration of the League took place at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket on 22 June and was said by the first director of the League, Mr. Geoffrey Whitworth, that \\"Drama was par excellence the art of the people, and the Theatre everyone's business\\". There was a wide range of individuals on the first committee. The Drama League was in essence an association composed of individual co-operators in amateur drama and affiliated amateur dramatic groups. It was very active in the pursuit of the creation of a National Theatre. One of the main planks of the Drama League was its Education platform. This evolved into a strong commitment to new writing and eventually the establishment of competitive Festivals. It provided a central organisation for amateur societies throughout England (despite the name \\"British\\"), it conducted drama schools and ran a drama library.John Bourne, The One-Act Play in England in William Kozlenko, Ed., The One-Act Play Today: A Discussion of the Technique, Scope and History of the Contemporary Short Drama, p229, (Ayer Publishing, 1970) By June 1923 there were 360 affiliated societies which included amateur and professional bodies. In 1926 professionals were expressing concern that the rapid growth of amateur drama was likely to cause problems with too many people trying to enter an already overcrowded profession. A Council Meeting was held to discuss this and in 1927 it was noted that the League's monthly journal 'Drama' was selling 3000 copies. This interest had started a British 'Festival of Community Drama' which was used to find an entry for the American New York Little Theatre Tournament. Other aspects of the League's work included the making of a substantial contribution to the Stratford-on-Avon Memorial Theatre, visits to Europe to help establish Festivals and the organisation of summer schools. The early festivals It has been argued that 1926 is the most important date in the history of the revival of the one-act play.John Bourne, The One-Act Play in England in William Kozlenko, Ed., The One-Act Play Today: A Discussion of the Technique, Scope and History of the Contemporary Short Drama, p228, (Ayer Publishing, 1970) The reason being that it was in 1926 that the British Drama League held its first experimental festival of one-act plays. In its first year seven societies took part in the competition, or festival as it was known. The next year the number was up to one hundred and fifty. In 1930 the number was 400, in 1932 600, and by 1936 seven hundred and forty seven groups had entered. Very quickly a system of rounds had therefore been developed to cope with the numbers of entries. There was a first round at a regional level from which adjudicators would send their selections forward to a second round. Another set of adjudicators would then send a selection forward to a final round held annually in London. This final round, started in 1927, included Scottish entries, thus there was no English Final as such. In 1927, the Scottish counterpart of the British Drama League, the Scottish Community Drama Association, had set up their own annual knockout festival which experienced similar success and by 1937 was attracting around three hundred and fifty entries. The Scottish festival had its own Scottish final, which went on to the London final to compete with English teams. In 1938 the final of the National Festival was held outside London for the first time following the invitation of the Scottish Community Drama Association. The war brought a significant reduction in the League's membership but activities continued as best they could throughout. The emphasis changed somewhat to encourage Youth clubs and military units for educational purposes. The English only finals After the Second World War the regions started to organise their own Festivals and the first England only Final was held in 1947. Until 1957 the organisation of subsequent annual Finals continued to be run by the British Drama League and eventually became the remit of the All England Theatre Festival. After 1957 the role of the British Drama League gradually faded away to be replaced by a mixture of support groups. The British Drama League became the British Theatre Association, with effect from 1 November 1972Victor Bonham-Carter, Authors by Profession (Society of Authors, 1978) and for financial reasons was dissolved in 1990. Its collections of play scripts (presented by Annie Horniman) are held in the most part by the Theatre Museum in LondonSarah Stanton, Martin Banham, Cambridge Paperback Guide to Theatre, p45 (Cambridge University Press, 1996) with the remaining part of the collection held by the Drama Association of Wales. Structure The All- England Theatre Festival organises an eliminating series of Festivals which leads ultimately to the English Finals. The winner of the English Final goes on to compete in the British Final Festival of One Act Plays against the winners of similar Festivals in Wales (Drama Association of Wales's Wales Final Festival of One Act Plays), Scotland (Scottish Community Drama Association's SCDA Festival) and Northern Ireland (Association of Ulster Drama Festivals's Ulster One-Act Finals). This \\"British Final Festival of One Act Plays\\" is the culmination of the National Festival of Community Theatre in the United Kingdom. England is divided into 4 Areas for the purposes of this Festival. Each Area is also divided into a number of Divisions according to the size and / or history of the individual Areas. Each division has a number of festivals and, dependent on the festival, either the winner or the winner and runner-up will proceed to the Divisional Quarter Final. The winners of the Divisional Quarter Finals go forward to the Area Semi-final. The winners of the four Area Semi-finals go forward to the English Final.

At the time of his death, he had held public office longer than any other Black elected official. Early life and freedom Wallace was born in Gates County, North Carolina in 1842. His early life was spent in slavery. In February 1862, he was freed by Federal troops passing through the area.

Online. August 5, 2008. He trained at Camp Casey . In December 1863, his unit was assigned to Ship Island, Mississippi. On February 13, 1864, Wallace travelled with his regiment to Key West, Florida. In April 1864 two companies of the 2nd United States Colored Infantry Regiment were transferred from Key West to Fort Myers. The two companies participated in many actions in southwest Florida during the remainder of the year, as far north as Tampa Bay. On February 20, 1865, Confederate forces attacked Fort Myers, precipitating the Battle of Fort Myers. Wallace was wounded in that battle. An exploding cannonball threw dirt into his eyes, causing injuries that would plague him throughout his life. Wallace's outfit joined the Union force blockading Apalachee Bay. They landed near St. Marks on March 4, 1865 and marched on Tallahassee, in time to take part in the debacle at the Battle of Natural Bridge. Walker and the regiment would not reach Tallahassee until August 9, 1865. Teaching in Tallahassee On leaving the service in January 1866, Wallace chose to remain in the Tallahassee area and became a prot√©g√© of Florida politician and planter William D. Bloxham. who gave Wallace a job teaching freed slaves at a school he set up on his plantation. The school and Wallace received high praise from a local paper. In 1868, he served as a page at the Florida Constitutional Convention. Political career After the Convention, he was elected constable of Leon County and joined the Republican Party of Florida, and became advocate for the rights of African-Americans. He served as constable for two years before being elected to the Legislature.Our Florida Legacy, Land, Legend and Leadership. page 12. Online. August 5, 2008. In 1870, he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives He was re- elected in 1872, despite a propensity for public violence. In 1874, he was elected to the Florida Senate and became a lawyer. He was photographed om the steps of the Florida Capitol with other legislators.https://books.google.com/books?id=e6s-hd6lBiQC&pg;=PA68&dq;=Anderson+J.+Peeler+florida&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiMvOqz6f_rAhVOo1kKHV7pCKYQ6AEwAXoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q;=Anderson%20J.%20Peeler%20florida&f;=false He made an unsuccessful bid for Congress in 1876. In 1878, his bid for re- election was unsuccessful. However, he was seated by the Senate after alleging fraud. Post Reconstruction In 1877, the federal occupation ended, with profound consequences for African Americans and for the Florida Republican Party. Blacks were systematically disenfranchised, and Florida would not see another Republican governor until Claude R. Kirk, Jr. in 1967. Democrats regained control of the Legislature. Black Republicans, including Wallace, became increasingly disillusioned. Wallace helped lead the Florida independent movement, and ran unsuccessfully as an Independent in the 1882 race for the state senate. In 1884, he supported Independent Frank Pope in the gubernatorial race with great optimism, but Black and liberal white voters were no longer strong enough to win elections in Florida. Wallace again ran for the Senate, but finished thirteenth. He was appointed a Customs House inspector in Key West for $2 per day, but was replaced in 1885, following the election of U.S. President Grover Cleveland. He left Key West and opened a law practice in Jacksonville. He argued a number of cases before the Florida Supreme Court. \\"Carpetbag Rule in Florida\\" was published in 1888. Carpetbag Rule was scathingly critical of Republican leadership under Reconstruction of the United States. According to this book, Republicans were, untrustworthy, venal and had merely used Blacks to further their quest for power. Democrats were the true friends of Florida blacks. The era of oppression and prejudice was past, and a new era of enlightenment under the auspices of the Democratic party had dawned. The book appeared just before the 1888 election, at a time advantageous to the Democratic Party. Questions have been raised as to whether Wallace actually authored the book, or whether it was actually written by Wallace's old mentor, Bloxham. Critics feel that whoever wrote it, it was heavily influenced by and advantageous to Bloxham. Brown Jr., Canter.Florida's Black Public Officials, 1867-1924. page x. University of Alabama Press. 1998. Online. August 5, 2008. Certainly Wallace had been embittered by his experiences as a Republican, and the book captured those sentiments. Hailed as a vigorous expos√© after publication, in more recent years its authority and authenticity have come under doubt. The book had little effect on Wallace. He continued to practice law and eschewed politics. Between 1891 and 1904, he won four of eleven appeals before the Florida Supreme Court. Wallace died on November 25, 1908, in Jacksonville, at the age of sixty-three.

Its northern border is the old road to Jerusalem; its southern border, the Elah Valley; and its western border, Sha'ar HaGai/Bab el-Wad and the road to Beit Shemesh. The largest towns in the Jerusalem corridor are Beit Shemesh, Mevasseret Zion, Abu Ghosh, Tzur Hadassah and Kiryat Ye'arim. History Vineyard in the Jerusalem corridor Historically, Arab villagers practised terrace farming in the narrow valleys and wadis of the area. During the 1947-48 war, the Jerusalem corridor was the only route for bringing supplies to besieged Jerusalem. In the Battle of Latrun, Jewish forces attempted to capture the former British police fort at Latrun, where Jordanian forces were stationed. The so-called Burma Road was built as an alternative. In October 1948, Israeli troops brought the area under their control during Operation Ha-Har. The Arab inhabitants fled their villages during the war.Jerusalem corridor history As of 1949, the mountainous, rocky region of the corridor was bare of trees. In the first decade of the State of Israel, a total of 35 agricultural settlements were established in the Jerusalem corridor by new immigrants from Yemen, Kurdistan, North Africa, Romania and Hungary. The JNF employed many of the newcomers in afforestation and land reclamation. Since then it has become one of the largest afforested regions in the country.

It was opened on 1 April 1929 as HMS Falcon, a Royal Navy stone frigate, and was used by Fleet Air Arm crews. It was transferred to the Maltese Government and redeveloped from January 1979. It is now closed and one of its runways is used by drag racing enthusiasts. The second runway is now a road leading to an industrial estate which was developed recently. Runways This airfield consisted of two runways, namely Runway 13/31 which was 6,000 ft (2,000 yards) long and Runway 9/27, which was 4,800 ft (1,600 yards) long. Runway 13/31 was resurfaced between 20 April and 26 May 1959 while the resurfacing of Runway 9/27 was carried out between 12 June and 28 July 1959. Its location on Malta was of great strategic importance in the Mediterranean, since it provided a base for aircraft carrier units en route to the rest of the British Empire. Compared to other airstrips on the island, Hal Far had better approaches over the sea and was the preferred diversionary base. It also provided excellent range facilities, making it the ideal location for armament training by the squadrons. Facilities Hal Far airfield provided various facilities, including an armoury, explosives area, workshops, a compass base and a control tower. It had also a radar test base and a number of hangars. It also included living quarters for H.Q. Staff, Officers and other ranks, and a sick bay, for medical purposes. World War II Hal Far under attack, 1941. During the Second World War, Hal Far airfield was one of the main targets for the Luftwaffe and the Regia Aeronautica and suffered several bombings during the blitz. On July and August 1940 in the beginning of the Siege of Malta, the Italian air-raids managed to damage several squadron aircraft. As the raids intensified during 1942 more damage was inflicted on the airfield and the squadrons, present on the airfield. On one particular attack on Hal Far by Junkers Ju 88s, a Fairey Swordfish was badly damaged. Further raids during January 1942 resulted in the destruction at Hal Far of two other Swordfish and a Blackburn Skua, and damaged 15 Hurricanes, three other Swordfish and a Fairey Fulmar. Further damage to aircraft, airfield buildings and loss of personnel resulted during attacks in 1942 and 1943, with the last bombing being recorded on 21 May 1943. Hal Far had been the first Maltese airfield to be bombed on 11 June 1940. During this period, 2,300 tons of bombs were dropped on the airfield, nevertheless it was never made unserviceable, due to the efficiency of the airfield repair parties. On the airfield itself the ground crew casualties numbered 30 killed and 84 injured. Various officers and Maltese civilian employees were awarded the George Cross, George Medal and other awards for their courage and bravery in the face of enemy action. With enemy air raids practically at an end, and as aircraft became heavier and traffic had increased significantly, paved runways and taxiways were added to the airfield, together with the completion of runways 13/31 and 9/27. Post war The Air Sea Rescue and Communications Flight, which had originally formed at Hal Far in March 1943, but which moved to Ta' Qali the following September, returned to Hal Far in March 1944. By 1944 Malta had therefore returned to normal and new aircraft were appearing all over the Island. The influx of large numbers of aircraft needed an expansion of dispersal areas and more huts, an undertaking carried out in October 1944. Further accommodation areas were added when FAA squadrons started arriving regularly at Hal Far for training periods. A different kind of event occurred in January 1945, when British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt came to Malta in anticipation of the Malta Conference with Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. To deter any possible enemy attack, nine Spitfire IXs of No. 1435 Squadron, and six Mosquito night fighters of No. 256 Squadron, deployed to Hal Far from Grottaglie and Foggia respectively, two of the Mosquitos escorting the Prime Minister's Avro York transport aircraft outside Malta and into Luqa airfield on 29 January. All aircraft remained at Hal Far into early February until all VIPs had left. After the evolution from piston to jet engines in the 1950s, the airfield had to be closed for three weeks for the resurfacing of the runways. The airfield started housing various training camps by the UK-based Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) Air Divisions. Training including live depth charges dropping, live armament practice and rocket firing on the uninhabited islet of Filfla, and hide and seek exercises with RN submarines in which aircraft sought out and shadowed the underwater 'raiders' and finally carried out mock attacks if they managed to find them. Several units used HMS Falcon for these annual summer camps, which started in 1950, stopped in 1951, and continued from 1952 to 1956. During 1957, the airfield also served as a civilian airport while the runways at RAF Luqa were being resurfaced. During 1958 Hal Far was the proving base for the world's first assault helicopter squadron. After being used by the Royal Navy, the Hal Far airfield was returned to the RAF for a short period of time in the mid and 1960s, and the last squadron was disbanded on 31 August 1967. This brought to an end 43 very active years of Malta's oldest and most historical airfield. It was subsequently placed on a 'care and maintenance' basis and served as a satellite for RAF Luqa. Between March 1967 and September 1978 the airfield served as a base for the American aircraft maintenance company M.I.A.Co. During the resurfacing of Luqa's runways, all civilian and military flying was transferred to Hal Far until Luqa became operational again. On 5 August 2010, the Employment & Training Corporation inaugurated an Underground Sick Bay which lies within the premises. This has been turned into a museum emphasising the period 1923-1945. The websitehalfarairfieldmalta.com/ gives an insight of the Museum. A number of model aircraft 1/72 scale have been built by a number of enthusiasts which shows some of the aircraft that landed at Hal Far in this period.

Both runways have been dug up and further development of the area reduced the airfield to a scar on the land. Runway 13/31 is currently being used by the Malta Drag Racing Association as a quarter mile dragstrip. Runway 9/27 is now a public road linking the various sections of the industrial area. Its scar can still be clearly seen on Google Maps when using the satellite image function. The control tower and the officer's quarters are still intact, together with a few Nissen huts. The kitchens and mess halls, the electricians and radio section cabin are still standing, but in a dilapidated state. The hangar being used as a refugee camp.

The operation was codenamed Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev (), after the 18th-century Field Marshal Peter Rumyantsev and was conducted by the Voronezh and Steppe Fronts (army groups) in the southern sector of the Kursk Bulge. The battle was referred to as the Fourth Battle of Kharkov by the Germans. The operation began in the early hours of 3 August 1943, with the objective of following up the successful Soviet defensive effort against the German Operation Citadel. The offensive was directed against the German Army Group South's northern flank. By 23 August, the troops of the Voronezh and Steppe Fronts had successfully seized Kharkov from German forces. It was the last time that Kharkov changed hands during the Soviet-German War. The operation led to the retreat of the German forces in Ukraine behind the Dnieper River and set the stage for the Battle of Kiev in autumn 1943. Background Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev had been planned by Stavka to be the major Soviet summer offensive in 1943. However, due to heavy losses sustained during the Battle of Kursk in July, time was needed for the Soviet formations to recover and regroup. Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev commenced on 3 August, with the aim of the defeating the 4th Panzer Army, Army Group Kempf, and the southern wing of Army Group South. It was also hoped that the German 1st Panzer Army and the newly reformed 6th Army would be trapped by an advance of the Red Army forces to the Azov Sea.Glantz & House p. 241. The Soviet forces included the Voronezh Front and the Steppe Front, which deployed about 1,144,000 men with 2,418 tanksKoltunov p. 81. and 13,633 guns and rocket launchers for the attack. Against this the German army could field 200,000 men and 237 tanks and assault guns.Erich von Manstein (right) and his chief of staff Hans Speidel German Army Group South commander General Erich von Manstein had anticipated that the Soviets would launch an attack across the Dnieper and Mius Rivers in an attempt to reach the Black Sea, cutting off the German forces extended in the southern portion of Army Group South in a repeat of the Stalingrad disaster.Manstein p. 445 When the Soviet Southern Front and the Southwestern Front launched just such an attack on 17 July the Germans responded by moving the II SS Panzer Corps, XXIV Corps and XLVIII Panzer Corps southward to blunt the Soviet offensive. In fact, these Soviet operations were intended to draw off German forces from the main thrust of the Soviet offensive, to dissipate the German reserve in anticipation for their main drive. The Soviet plan called for the 5th and 6th Guards Armies, and the 53rd Army, to attack on a 30-kilometer wide sector, supported by a heavy artillery concentration, and break through the five successive German defensive lines between Kursk and Kharkov. The former two armies had borne the brunt of the German attack in Operation Citadel. Supported by two additional mobile corps, the 1st Tank Army and the 5th Guards Tank Army, both mostly re-equipped after the end of Operation Citadel, would act as the front's mobile groups and develop the breakthrough by encircling Kharkov from the north and west. Mikhail Katukov's 1st Tank Army was to form the westward-facing outer encirclement line, while Pavel Rotmistrov's 5th Guards Tank Army would form the inner line, facing the city. A secondary attack to the west of the main breakthrough was to be conducted by the 27th and 40th Armies with the support of four separate tank corps. Meanwhile, to the east and southeast, the 69th and 7th Guards Armies, followed later by the Southwestern Front's 57th Army, were to join the attack. Offensive operation Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev On 3 August the offensive was begun with a heavy artillery barrage directed against the German defensive positions. Though the German defenders fought tenaciously, the two tank armies committed to the battle could not be held back. By 5 August the Soviets had broken through the German defensive lines, moving into the rear areas and capturing Belgorod while advancing some 60 km. Delivering powerful sledgehammer blows from the north and east, the attackers overwhelmed the German defenders. German reserves were shifted from the Orel sector and north from the Donbas regions in an attempt to stem the tide and slow down the Soviet attacks. Success was limited to the \\"Grossdeutschland\\" division delaying the 40th Army by a day. Seven panzer and motorized divisions making up the III Panzer Corps, along with four infantry divisions were assembled to counterattack into the flank of the advancing Soviet forces but were checked. After nine days the 2nd SS \\"Das Reich\\" and 3rd SS \\"Totenkopf\\" divisions arrived and initiated a counterattack against the two Soviet Armies near Bogodukhov, 30 km northwest of Kharkov. In the following armoured battles of firepower and maneuver the SS divisions destroyed a great many Soviet tanks. To assist the 6th Guards Army and the 1st Tank Army, the 5th Guards Tank Army joined the battles. All three Soviet armies suffered heavily, and the tank armies lost more than 800 of their initial 1,112 tanks. These Soviet reinforcements stopped the German counterattack, but their further offensive plans were blunted. With the Soviet advance around Bogodukhov stopped, the Germans now began to attempt to close the gap between Akhtyrka and Krasnokutsk. The counterattack started on 18 August, and on 20 August \\"Totenkopf\\" and \\"Gro√üdeutschland\\" met behind the Soviet units. Parts of two Soviet armies and two tank corps were trapped, but the trapped units heavily outnumbered the German units. Many Soviet units were able to break out, while suffering heavy casualties. After this setback the Soviet troops focused on Kharkov and captured it after heavy fighting on 23 August. German Tiger I tanks near Belgorod, August 1943 The battle is usually referred to as the Fourth Battle of Kharkov by the Germans and the Belgorod‚ÄìKharkov Strategic Offensive Operation by the Soviets. The Soviet operation was executed in two primary axis, one in the Belgorod-Kharkov axis and another in the Belgorod- Bogodukhov axis. On the first day, the units of the Voronezh Front quickly penetrated the German front-line defences on the boundary of the 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf, between Tomarovka and Belgorod and gained 100 kilometres in a sector along the Akhtyrka-Bogodukhov-Olshany-Zolochev line along the banks of the Merla river. They were finally halted on 12 August by armoured units of the III Panzer Corps. On 5 August 1943 XI Corps evacuated the city of Belgorod. (see Belgorod-Bogodukhov Offensive Operation) Panzer Operations The Eastern Front Memoir of General Raus 1941-1945 bt Steven H Newton 2003 pp213-215  Kharkov retaken  Following its withdrawal from Belgorod on the night of 5/6 August 1943, the XI Army Corps under the command of General Erhard Raus now held defensive positions south of the city between the Donets and Lopan rivers north of Kharkov. The XI Army Corps consisted of a Kampfgruppe (battlegroup) from the 167th Infantry Division, the 168th, 106th, 198th, 320th Infantry Divisions, and the 6th Panzer Division which acted as was the corps reserve.Panzer Operations The Eastern Front Memoir of General Raus 1941-1945 by Steven H Newton Da Capo Press edition 2003 pp213-216 This constituted a deep salient east into Soviet lines and was subject to outflanking attempts on the corps left flank; Soviet armoured units had already appeared 20 miles behind the corps front line. XI Army Corps now made a series of phased withdrawals toward Kharkov to prevent encirclement. Only reaching the final defenses north of the city on 12 August 1943, following breakthroughs by the 57th and 69th Armies in several sectors of the front- line, the disintegration of the 168th Infantry Division and after an intervention by the corps reserve. When its attempts to force a breakthrough in the Bogodukhov-Olshany-Zolochev met with frustration along the Merla River, the Steppe Front directed its assaults towards Korotich, a sector held by 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich to cut the Poltava-Kharkov rail link. Fierce fighting ensued, in which Korotich was captured by the 5th Guards Mechanised Corps and subsequently recaptured by grenadiers from 2nd SS then to remain under German control, but the 5th Guards Tank Army (Pavel Rotmistrov) did cut the rail link finally on 22 August 1943.Decision in the Ukraine Summer 1943 II SS & III Panzer Corps, George M Nipe Jr, J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing. 1996 Page 324 The loss of this line of communication was a serious blow to the ability of the Army Detachment Kempf to defend its positions around the city. This meant critical delays of supplies and reinforcements, and the unit's position was becoming increasingly untenable. The way to Poltava now remained open, but Soviet General Nikolai Vatutin hesitated to push through while the Germans flanking the gap held firm. Instead, he turned his left flank armies, the 5th Guards Tank Army and the 5th Guards Army, against the western front of Army Group Kempf where the 2nd and 3rd SS Panzer Divisions fought to keep the front angled south-westward away from Kharkov. On the weaker east front of Army Group Kempf, the Soviet 57th Army cleared the right bank of the Donets between Chuguyev and Zmiyev, but the army command somehow could not quite bring itself to try for a full scale breakthrough.Stalingrad to Berlin - The German Defeat in the East by Earl F Ziemke by Dorset Press 1968 page 154 These threats had led to a request by General Werner Kempf to abandon the city on 12 August 1943. Erich von Manstein did not object, but Adolf Hitler countered with an order that the city had to be held \\"under all circumstances\\". After a prediction that the order to hold Kharkov would produce \\"another Stalingrad\\", on 14 August 1943 Manstein relieved Kempf and appointed General Otto W√∂hler in his place. A few days later, Army Group Kempf was renamed the 8th Army.Stalingrad to Berlin - The German Defeat in the East by Earl F Ziemke by Dorset Press 1968 page 153 Kharkov now constituted a deep German salient to the east, which prevented the red army from making use of this vital traffic and supply centre. Following boastful reports made by Soviet radio that Soviet troops had entered the city, when in fact it was still held by XI Army Corps, Joseph Stalin personally ordered its immediate capture.Panzer Operations The Eastern Front Memoir of General Raus 1941-1945 bt Steven H Newton 2003 Page 242 Soviet used Churchill Mk IV Tank at the fourth battle of Kharkov in 1943 The German supply situation in Kharkov was now catastrophic; artillerymen, after firing their last rounds, were abandoning their guns to fight as infantry. The army's supply depot had five trainloads of spare tank tracks left over from \\"Zitadelle\\" but very little else. The high consumption of ammunition in the last month and a half had cut into supplies put aside for the last two weeks of August and the first two weeks of September; until the turn of the month the army would have to get along with fifty percent of its daily average requirements in artillery and tank ammunition. XI Army Corps now had a combat strength of only 4,000 infantrymen, one man for every ten yards of front.Stalingrad to Berlin - The German Defeat in the East by Earl F Ziemke by Dorset Press 1968 page 156 W√∂hler, recognizing the hopelessness of the situation, did not prove any more resolute; in view of the harsh realities facing the defenders of Kharkov, he knew that the depleted infantry regiments could not hold their positions without copious artillery support. Two days after taking command of 8th Army, W√∂hler also asked Manstein for permission to abandon the city. Regardless of Hitler's demand that the city be held, W√∂hler and Manstein agreed that the city could not be defended for long, given the diminishing German strength and the overwhelming size of Soviet reserves. On 21 August 1943, Manstein gave his consent to withdraw from Kharkov. On 22 August 1943 the Germans began their retreat from the city, under pressure from the Soviets. The 57th & 69th Armies pushed in from three sides with the coming of daylight. The Soviets sensed that the Germans were evacuating Kharkov, due to the lessening of artillery fire and diminishing resistance in the front lines. Later in the day, thunderous explosions were heard as ammunition dumps were blown up. Large German columns were then observed leaving the city and the Soviet troops pushed into the largely destroyed city. After changing hands several times, it had finally been liberated by the Soviets. Moving out of Kharkov to the south, the German forces fought to hold open a corridor through which the 8th Army could withdraw. Soviet artillery and mortars shelled the corridor, and planes strafed and bombed the German columns leaving the city. After dark, the 89th Guards and 107th Rifle Divisions broke into the interior of the city, driving the last German rearguard detachments before them. Enormous fires were set by the Germans, hoping to delay the Soviet advance. The city became a hellish place of fire and smoke, artillery fire and desperate combat, punctuated by the explosions of supply dumps. By 0200 on 23 August 1943, elements of the 183rd Rifle Division pushed into the city centre, reached the Dzerzhinsky Square and met men from the 89th Rifle Division. The Soviet troops hoisted a red banner over the city once again. By 1100, Kharkov and its outskirts had been taken completely. The fourth and final battle for the city was over.The Road to Berlin John Erickson Westview Press 1983 Page 121 Aftermath By re-establishing a continuous front on Army Group South's left flank, the 4th Panzer Army and the 8th Army had, for the moment, blunted a deadly thrust, but to the north and southeast fresh blows had already been dealt or were in the making. Employing the peculiar rippling effect that marked their offensives, the Red Army, thwarted in one place, had shifted to others. For the first time in the war they had the full strategic initiative, and they used it well.Stalingrad to Berlin - The German Defeat in the East by Earl F Ziemke by Dorset Press 1968 page 158 The failure of Operation Citadel meant the Germans permanently lost the strategic initiative on the Eastern Front without any hope of regaining it, although Hitler refused to acknowledge it. The large manpower losses of the Wehrmacht in July and August 1943 severely restricted Army Groups South and Centre to react to future thrusts during the winter and 1944. Operations Polkovodets Rumyantsev, along with the concurrent Operation Kutuzov marked the first time in the war that the Germans were not able to defeat a major Soviet offensive during the summer and regain their lost ground and the strategic initiative.Decision in the Ukraine Summer 1943 II SS & III Panzer Corps, George M Nipe Jr, J.J.

Soviet casualties in the Belgorod‚ÄìKharkov sector during this operation are estimated to be 71,611 killed and 183,955 wounded; 1,864 tanks, 423 artillery guns, and 153 aircraft were lost. German personnel losses were at least 10,000 killed and missing and 20,000 wounded. German tank losses are estimated to be several times lower than Soviet tank losses.

Early life John Kassay graduated from North Tarrytown High School in 1938. Kassay earned a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star while serving in Gen. George S. Patton's Third Army in the Second World War. He married Mary Brunner after the war and attended East Central University (B.A. 1949) and Pittsburg State University in Kansas (M.A. 1950) on the GI Bill. He completed a doctorate in education at Washington State University in 1970. Career Kassay taught industrial arts in junior and senior high schools in Kansas and, for over thirty years, at San Francisco State University, where he was professor in the Department of Design and Industry. Kassay taught courses in woodworking technology and construction at San Francisco State, running \\"probably the finest woodworking program in America\\" according to Tom McFadden in Cabinet Maker magazine. In 1980, Kassay published \\"The Book of Shaker Furniture\\" to wide acclaim. The book featured his own illustrations based on years of research. The book was universally praised for its exquisitely rendered and finely detailed drawings of Shaker furniture. When former President Jimmy Carter received Kassay's book on Shaker furniture in late 1983, he wrote at the bottom of the official typed reply letter: \\"I've long admired the beautiful simplicity of Shaker furniture and have made several of their pieces myself. Merry Christmas. JC.\\" Kassay later turned his attention to American Windsor furniture and produced an elegant and informative guide to the Windsor style. He continued to lecture and publish on both styles after being awarded emeritus status in 1987. In addition to his books, Professor Kassay also was a frequent contributor to woodworking and industrial arts journals.

In a context of Old Slavonic language, is a digraph that can replace a letter and vice versa. Modern Slavic languages written in the Cyrillic alphabet make little or no use of digraphs. There are only two true digraphs: for (Belarusian, Bulgarian, Ukrainian) and for (Belarusian, Ukrainian). Sometimes these digraphs are even considered as special letters of respective alphabets. In standard Russian, however, the letters in and are always pronounced separately. Digraph-like letter pairs include combinations of consonants with the soft sign (Serbian/Macedonian letters and are derived from and ), and or for the uncommon and optional Russian phoneme . Native descriptions of Cyrillic writing system often use the term \\"digraph\\" to combinations and (Bulgarian, Ukrainian) as they both correspond to a single letter of Russian and Belarusian alphabets ( is used for , and for ). Cyrillic uses large numbers of digraphs only when used to write non-Slavic languages; in some languages such as Avar, these are completely regular in formation.

Note that three of these are tetragraphs. However, gemination for the 'strong' consonants in Avar orthography is sporadic, and the simple letters or digraphs are frequently used in their place. Belarusian Belarusian language has the following digraphs: *'–¥–∑' for affricates [dÕ°z] and [dÕ°z ≤] (see :uk:–¥–∑) *'–¥–∂' for affricates [dÕ° í] and [dÕ° í ≤] (see –¥–∂).

Tatar Tatar has a number of vowels which are written with ambiguous letters that are normally resolved by context, but which are resolved by discontinuous digraphs when context is not sufficient. These ambiguous vowel letters are –µ, front or back , —é, front or back ; and —è, front or back . They interact with the ambiguous consonant letters –∫, velar or uvular , and –≥, velar or uvular . In general, velar consonants occur before front vowels and uvular consonants before back vowels, so it is frequently not necessary to specify these values in the orthography. However, this is not always the case. A uvular followed by a front vowel, as in \\"kinsman\\", for example, is written with the corresponding back vowel to specify the uvular value: –∫–∞—Ä–¥”ô—à. The front value of –∞ is required by vowel harmony with the following front vowel ”ô, so this spelling is unambiguous. If, however, the proper value of the vowel is not recoverable by through vowel harmony, then the letter —å is added at the end of the syllable, as in \\"poet\\". That is, is written with a —ã rather than a –∏ to show that the –≥ is pronounced rather than , then the —å is added to show that the —ã is pronounced as if it were a –∏, so the discontinuous digraph —ã...—å is used here to write the vowel . This strategy is also followed with the ambiguous letters –µ, —é, and —è in final syllables, for instance in cheap. That is, the discontinuous digraphs –µ...—å, —é...—å, —è...—å are used for plus the front vowels . Exceptional final-syllable velars and uvulars, however, are written with simple digraphs, with —å for velars and —ä for uvulars: pure, promise.

The e-Reader and e-Paper Outlook for 2013-2014. Good E Reader. May 22, 2013.  History  In 2003 after the failure of Cytale (the first European company to make an ebook reader) two former engineers of Cytale, Laurent Picard and Micha√´l Dahan, bought the intellectual property of the Cytale reading device, the Cybook Gen1. They founded the company, Bookeen, to produce dedicated ebook reading devices. Their first product was the Cybook Gen1. The Cybook Gen1 was Bookeen's only product until 2006/2007, when they began exploring E-ink screens. At the time, E-Ink screens were a new technology and claimed to have a near paper-like appearance that did not cause eyestrain. In late 2007 Bookeen began selling the Cybook Gen3, their first eBook reader to use an E-Ink screen. At the end of 2008, Bookeen started to claim future support for the ePub eBook format. The current firmware supporting it for all models; however, this firmware can not support the older Mobipocket format. Another firmware with support for Mobipocket is still made available so the user can select the desired format. The Swedish Internet Book Store AdLibris initiated a cooperation with Bokeen, and started 2010 to sell the \\"l√§splatta\\" (Swedish for ebook reader) named Letto an exact copy of Bookeen, except with Swedish menus and Swedish dictionary. When the frontline model of Bookeen was introduced 2014, the Swedish twin version was also manufactured and sold by AdLibirs in the Scandinavian market. In 2009 they also announced a new product the Cybook Opus a smaller version of the Cybook Gen3 but with some improvements: improved shape, accelerometer, 1 GB of user memory, and a 400Mhz CPU. June 2010 Bookeen published a much improved firmware for Gen3 and Opus devices. In August 2011, Bookeen launches its own e-book store called BookeenStore.com with ePub and PDF format books, and a selection of free e-books with no DRM.Bookeen launches a new e-book store.

He became an instructor at the University of Arizona, and by 1936 he was heading up the Astronomy Department. In 1938 he became directory of Steward Observatory, remaining in that post until 1963. He also served as Vice-president and chairman for the Astronomical Divisions of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Among the subjects of his research were white dwarf stars, supernovae and galactic astronomy. He discovered a relationship between the density of galaxies in a cluster and the size of the cluster: larger clusters have a lower density of galaxies. He provided the data that led to Willem Jacob Luyten's discovery of UV Ceti, the first known flare star. He was married to Ethel and the couple had two children, Roger and Emily. The asteroid 1852 Carpenter is named after him, while the crater Carpenter on the Moon is co-named in honor of him and James Carpenter.

In 1881, he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment in Mountjoy Jail, Dublin, for what became known as the \\"Crossmolina Conspiracy\\", where he was reportedly subjected to harsh treatment. Nally died in prison in November 1891, and the resultant Nally G.A.A. Club in Dublin would be closely associated with working class nationalists and republicans during the 1890s and beyond. Irish Republican Brotherhood Nally was the eldest son and one of six brothers, of a prosperous farmer of \\"advanced nationalist\\" views. Nally from an early age had been a Fenian, and by the late 1870s was a leading organiser of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. He was also present at the founding meeting in August 1879, of the Land League of Mayo, later becoming the Land League. Nally was elected a joint secretary. By 1880, Nally had become a member of the IRB's Supreme Council. Sport In 1879, Michael Cusack, credited with founding the Gaelic Athletic Association, met Nally, who had in 1877 attempted to start a nationalist athletics association but it never got off the ground. Cusack found that Nally's views on the influence of British landlordism on Irish athletics were the same as his. Cusack would recall how both Nally and himself while walking through the Phoenix Park in Dublin seeing only a handful of people playing sports in the park so depressed them that they agreed it was time to \\"make an effort to preserve the physical strength of our race.\\" Nally organised a National Athletics Sports meeting in County Mayo in September 1879 which was a success, with Cusack organising a similar event which was open to 'artisans' in Dublin the following April. Death Nally died in Mountjoy Prison on 9 November 1891. His funeral was organised by James Boland, with whom he had conspired in Manchester. Legacy One of the stands in Croke Park is named after Nally, and is unique for being the only stand in the stadium named after a person who had no connection to the Gaelic Athletic Association.

He did his postgraduate study at Purdue University (Ph.D. 1989; Advisor: Prof. Henry Weiner). In 1992, Guan joined the faculty in the University of Michigan (UM) Department of Biological Chemistry. From 1996 to 2000, he was an associate professor at UM. In 2000 Guan became a professor (Halvor Christensen Collegiate Professor in Life Sciences, 2003‚Äì2007) at UM.http://www.ur.umich.edu/9798/Jun10_98/guan.htm In 1998, Kun-Liang Guan was rewarded a MacArthur Fellowship, with a grant of $230,000 over five years. Before this, he won the Schering-Plough Award, by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB). Guan currently is a professor of the Department of Pharmacology and the Moores Cancer Center at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Guan's research focuses on cancer biology and the intracellular signal transduction in cell growth regulation.http://cancer.ucsd.edu/summaries/kuguan.asp Guan has made seminal contributions in the fields of protein tyrosine phosphatase, Mitogen-Activated Protein (MAP) kinase, and the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. Guan and his team have published numerous influential papers in, many publications, such as Cell, Nature and Science. Research in Guan's laboratory focuses on intracellular signal transduction in cell growth regulation and cancer biology. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of benign tumors in a wide range of tissues. Mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor gene are responsible for TSC disease. TSC1 and TSC2 proteins form a physical and functional complex. Recent studies from Guan's laboratory demonstrate that TSC1/TSC2 functions to inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is a central cell growth controller conserved from yeast to human. mTOR integrates a wide range of signals, including growth factors, nutrients, and stress conditions, to regulate cell growth and cell size. Two distinct TOR complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, have been identified. These two TOR complexes phosphorylate different substrates and have distinct physiological functions. For example, TORC1 phosphorylates the ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K), thereby regulating translation and cell growth. In contrast, TORC2 phosphorylates and activates AKT, a key kinase involved in cell growth and apoptosis. Guan and his team are interested in how mTOR is regulated by upstream signals, such nutrients and cellular energy levels. In addition, they are studying the mechanism of mTOR activation by the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The second project in his laboratory is studying the novel Hippo tumor suppressor pathway. Recent genetic studies in Drosophila have shown that the Hippo signaling pathway plays a key role in restricting organ size by controlling both cell proliferation and apoptosis. Components of the Hippo pathway are highly conserved in mammalian cells. Acting down stream of the Hippo pathway is the YAP oncogene, which encodes a transcription co-activator. Their recent studies have shown that regulation of YAP by the Hippo pathway plays a critical role in cell contact inhibition. Furthermore, YAP is elevated in many human cancers. The main focus of this project is to elucidate the physiological regulation of the Hippo pathway and to understand how dysregulation of the pathway contributes to tumorigenesis.

Just east of the city's downtown district, the sanctuary includes towering limestone and sandstone bluffs that date back more than 450 million years, spring-fed wetlands, abundant bird life, and dramatic views of the downtown Saint Paul skyline and Mississippi River. The park was opened to the public on May 21, 2005, and was named after its early supporter U.S. Representative Bruce Vento. The sanctuary has a rich ecological and human history. Once a floodplain where Phalen Creek and Trout Brook flowed together into the Mississippi River, the land was used and valued by Native people for thousands of years, and was home to Wakan Tipi (Spirit House), a sacred Dakota site also known as Carver's Cave, after explorer and writer Jonathan Carver. When the land that included today's Saint Paul was ceded to England after the French and Indian War, Carver was dispatched by England to explore the new colonial possession. He traveled up the Mississippi River, and encountered the Dakota on the bluffs in Saint Paul and Wakan Tipi on November 14, 1766. His discovery of the cave and the Dakota led him to explore the spiritual site, describing in detail, ‚ÄúThe rock at the entrance of the cave is of lightish gray colour and very soft like the grit of a grindstone. I found many strange heiroglyphycks cut in the stone some of which was very ancient and grown over with moss. On the stone I marked the arms of the King of England.‚Äù Carver's recorded explorations later became a book, Travels through the Interior Parts of North America (1778), and he gave the landmark his own name. The book's popularity made Wakan Tipi an attraction for early settlers, but the cave was lost after falling limestone and debris covered its entrance. In 1837, the Dakota ceded their lands east of the Mississippi River (35 million acres) after the early American expansion of the 1830s. Fourteen years later, the Mdewakanton Dakota ceded their lands west of the river for reservations up to the Minnesota River. After the Dakota were forced to leave, European immigrants took over the land and cultivated it, leading to industrial expansions.Clark, Sarah. ‚ÄúBruce Vento Nature Sanctuary: A Natural Gem in the Heart of Saint Paul.‚Äù National Park Service. Web. September 18, 2014. The North Star Brewery was built into the bluff in 1853 and later became Jacob Schmidt's first brewery. In the 1880s the land was claimed for industrial use, resulting in the expansion of railroads and the destruction of the Wakan Tipi petroglyphs. Abandoned in the 1970s, the of land were purchased through a broad partnership, and became a Saint Paul park in 2005. An additional of adjacent industrial land were purchased and added to the park in 2008. The sanctuary's floodplain forests, oak woodlands, prairies and other native ecosystems are being carefully restored and the park has gained state and national recognition for its combination of ecological and cultural resources ‚Äî and for the community involvement in its transformation. Owned and operated by the City of Saint Paul, the sanctuary lies within the National Park Service's Mississippi River and Recreation Area. The Lower Phalen Creek Project, an active community-led partnership, assists with ongoing restoration, volunteer activities and interpretation in coordination with Historic Saint Paul. The Trust for Public Land led acquisition efforts and interns from the Community Design Center of Minnesota's East Side Youth Conservation Corps work to restore the site's ecology and act as student naturalists. Neighborhood organizations, including the Dayton's Bluff Community Council and Friends of Swede Hollow, are closely involved in the sanctuary and the adjacent Swede Hollow Park. Planned efforts include a direct pedestrian/bicycle trail connection to the Mississippi River and redeveloping the land adjacent to the sanctuary for an interpretive center and other park- related use.

The name Kammuri was submitted to the World Meteorological Organisation's Typhoon Committee by Japan and is Japanese for the Corona Borealis constellation of stars. Severe Tropical Storm Kammuri was the ninth tropical cyclone to occur in the Western North Pacific in 2008, recognised by the Japan Meteorological Agency operationally. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center also recognised Kammuri as the tenth tropical cyclone in the 2008 Pacific typhoon season. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), recognised Julian as the 10th tropical cyclone, of the 2008 Pacific typhoon season. Kammuri developed as a tropical depression on August 4 to the north of the island of Luzon. With the depression then intensifying into a Tropical storm the next day and was assigned the name Kammuri by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) Tokyo. The following day it reached its peak wind speeds of which made it a weak severe tropical storm. It then made landfall on China in the western Guangdong province this landfall made Kammuri weaken first into a Tropical Storm that evening with the JTWC then issuing their last advisory on Kammuri. Kammuri then emerged into the Gulf of Tonkin the next day, but made a second landfall over China but this time in the Guangxi province of China. After Kammuri made landfall the JMA issued its final advisory on Kammuri. Heavy rains from Kammuri in Vietnam led to the loss of at least 100 lives and destroyed over 300 homes while damaging over 3,500 others. Meteorological history On August 3, PAGASA identified a tropical disturbance which was located in the South China Sea to the north of Luzon island in the Philippines and was later classified as Tropical Depression Julian. Later that day the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated Julian as a minor tropical depression and initiated advisories on the tropical depression. Early the next day the JMA started to issue full advisories on the tropical depression. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) then started to issue warnings on the tropical depression later that day with them designating it as Tropical Depression 10W. Furthermore, later that day both PAGASA and the JTWC upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm. Infra-red satellite image of Tropical Storm Kammuriintensifying on August 5 On August 5, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and named it Kammuri, whilst PAGASA released their final advisory on Tropical Storm Kammuri (Julian) later that day as it moved out of their Area of Responsibility and headed towards mainland China. The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) then upgraded Kammuri to a severe tropical storm late on August 5, with the JMA doing the same early the next morning. However, Kammuri started to weaken after making landfall along the south coast of China in the Western Guangdong Province at about 12pm UTC on August 6. After Kammuri had made landfall the JMA downgraded Kammuri to a tropical storm, whilst the JTWC issued their final advisory later that day on Tropical Storm Kammuri. Early the next day Tropical Storm Kammuri emerged into the Gulf of Tonkin, however later that day Kammuri made landfall again in the Guangxi province of China. After making landfall for the second time on August 7 Kammuri weakened to a tropical depression as the JMA issued its final advisory. However the JMA continued to monitor the depression in their WWJP25 warnings until early on August 8. Preparations=Philippines As Tropical Depression Julian formed to the north of the Philippines On August 3, PAGASA issued Storm Signal #1, a warning for winds of 30‚Äì60 km/h (19‚Äì37 mph), for parts of Luzon. The parts of Luzon that were under Public Storm Signal #1 included the Batanes Group of Islands, Babuyan Group of Islands, Calayan Group of Islands, northern Cagayan, Apayao, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Abra and La Union. Early on the afternoon of August 4 PAGASA lowered Storm Signal #1 for all regions of Luzon except for Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Abra, La Union.

Within their first advisory on Kammuri the HKO raised the Standby Signal No.1 for Hong Kong Late the next day the HKO hoisted the Strong Wind Signal No.3 which meant that winds above were expected to be blowing in Hong Kong within 12 hours. However, during the morning of August 6 the HKO issued the Northeast Gale or Storm Signal No.8. Later that day, the HKO hoisted the Southeast Gale or Storm Signal No.8, which was replacing the 8NE Warning However nine hours later the HKO removed the 8SE warning and downgraded it to Signal No.3 later that day, which was in force for 11 hours before it was downgraded to Signal 1 which was in force for 3 hours before all signals were cancelled. Impact=Philippines Tropical Storm Julian (Kammuri) did not make landfall in the Philippines. However, it enhanced the southwest monsoon which continued to bring heavy rain to the Philippines. However, no damage was reported in the Philippines China Kammuri affected athletes training for the Olympics which were about to be held within China and Hong Kong. =Macau= Kammuri caused ferry services between Macau and Guangdong Province to close down. Bus services were cancelled with most plane flights cancelled or severely delayed =Hong Kong= The impact of Tropical Storm Kammuri was felt strongly in Hong Kong, shortly before its landfall in china, with at least 37 people being injured.

The city of Port Lincoln lies to the northwest of the island. Between them, the Gambier Islands and Thistle form a chain across the mouth of the gulf between the southern tips of the Yorke and Eyre Peninsulas,Collins concise atlas of the world (3rd ed.) (1993). London: HarperCollins. sometimes referred to as the Taylor Islands group. The island is approximately 17 kilometres (10.5 mi) long and varies in width from 1 kilometre wide (0.6 mi) at its narrowest central part to 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) wide in the south-east part. Whaler's Bay is a wide bay on the east coast of the island, and Albatross Island is a tiny island to the south. As of 2014 the Royal Australian Navy operated an acoustic range in the waters west of Thistle Island, with a small control facility being located on the island itself. History The island was named by British explorer Matthew Flinders in 1802, after a terrible accident in which a cutter that was mastered by John Thistle and carrying 7 other men, overturned in choppy seas while returning from the mainland to the ship. Despite frantic searching by the ships crew, the bodies of the men were never found. Flinders also named several smaller islands in the area after the lost crew.Matthew Flinders, A voyage to Terra Australis (Chapter 6). Retrieved 25 January 2019 Evidence of a failed settlement was noted by early whalers. It was speculated that the remains, which \\"the ruins of some cottages with signs of regular order in their arrangement and a cleared promenade between them, all the loose limestone for a distance of a bout 100 yards having been thrown on each side of a broad path.\\" It was speculated that the ruins may have been built by survivors of the La Perouse expedition of 1788. A small community of sealers, their Aboriginal \\"wives\\" and children were living on the island by 1832. They are thought to have had their camp on the shore of Waterhouse Bay.Kostoglou & McCarthy, p.57. The South Australian Company established a shore-based bay whaling station at Whalers Bay in 1838, during the period of British colonisation of South Australia. A team of experienced whalers were brought from Tasmania with H.B.T. McFarlane in charge as headsman. The operation had limited success during the 1838 season and none at all in the 1839 season. It was concluded the location was too far from the migration route of the southern right whale and the site was abandoned. The historic Whalers Bay Whaling Site and Thistle Island Sealing Site are both listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. Geology Thistle Island has a crystalline basement overlain by calcareous aeolianite. There are steep cliffs of calcareous aeolianite on the shore. There are recent beach sands on the eastern side, and several small lakes exist on the other sided of a strip of coastal dunes. Albatross Island, a tiny island predominantly crystalline basement with a thin layer of calcareous aeolianite.  Flora & Fauna  Visitors to Thistle Island in 1877 found neither little penguins nor Australian sea lions, but did find numbers of paper nautilus shells on the island's inner beach. Visitors to Whaler's Bay heard the calls of \\"hundreds\\" of little penguins from their anchorage there in 1904. In 1932, J. T. Mortlock gave an account from Whaler's Bay of the \\"mournful symphony of the curlews and penguins in the nearby cliffs\\". An account of a visit in 1928 wrote: \\"On Black Rock, at the north end of Thistle Island, we disturbed a large colony of seals, which rapidly scrambled into the water as the yacht passed by. Shags were plentiful. Many types of sea fowl were observed, including gannet, arctic skua, mollyhawk and stormy petrel.\\" Former Lord Mayor of Adelaide A. S. Hawker held a fishing record for a 47 lb tuna that he caught off Thistle Island in the late 1930s. Little penguin breeding sites were noted in a 1996 survey of South Australia's offshore islands, though the colony may have been recorded on Albatross Island, off the island's southern tip. The island is the home to an introduced population of the greater bilby.

She had great feuds most notably with Shelley Francis, ‚ÄòBlack Venus‚Äô Jean Kirkland, Wendi Richter, Brandi Wine, Lelani Kai, Rustee the Foxx Thomas, Rosebud, Jamie West, Brandi Alexander, Babyface Nellie, Ivory and many other great Ladies. Brown was linked to Queen Front man Freddie Mercury for many, many years until his death in 1991 as well as Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler and performed in multiple music videos starting in her mid-teens starting with Queen and multiple other top bands spanning four decades. Professional wrestling career In 1984, Brown began her training to become a professional wrestler at The Fabulous Moolah's Girl Pro Wrestling School in Columbia, South Carolina under the direct training of The Fabulous Moolah and Donna Christanello. She then trained under Killer Kowalski and was the Ladies Champion of Kowalski's International Wrestling Federation for well over a decade. Brown eventually became one of Kowalski's trainers to both male and female students at his school outside of Boston, Massachusetts. During the same time she was the IWF Ladies Champion, she was also the Ladies Champion of the National Wrestling Alliance and a number of independent promotions including Empire Pro Wrestling, National Wrestling Federation, World Wrestling Alliance and the New England Wrestling Federation. She was known as The Boston Bad Girl due to her 'in ring' villainous tactics. Brown worked for multiple Federations including WCW, ICW, NWA, LPWA, IWF, WWWA, NEWF, NAWA, USWF, WWA, EWF and many, many more. In 1994, Brown was honored by the Cauliflower Alley Club along with other female inductees Candi Devine, Sherri Martel, Kitty Adams, and Susan Green as well as male inductees Gorilla Monsoon And Pedro Morales. She was also the first female to ever be elected as an officer of the once very prestigious Cauliflower Alley Club under then President Lou Thesz. Brown was also not only on the Board of The LIWA run by The Fabulous Moolah and Mae Young, but was honored by the organization before becoming an Officer. In 2013 Ms. Brown was inducted into the New England Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame. On February 27, 1998, Brown beat number- one contender Brandi Alexander and retained her NWA New Jersey Championship title at the Third Annual Eddie Gilbert Memorial Brawl at the Airport Radisson Hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Fabulous Moolah was in Brown's corner while Fred The Elephant Boy from The Howard Stern Show was at ringside with Ms. Alexander. She and a former partner began a New England-based independent wrestling promotion called the World Wrestling Alliance in 1999 which was around for many years and featured many wrestlers from the WWF Dojo and several Tough Enough stars. At a Killer Kowalski Birthday Wrestling show, lady wrestler Violet Flame and her husband Steve King, along with an unknown Referee changed the finish so that Flame could win a match. Former ICW wrestler ‚ÄòThe Boston Bad Boy‚Äô Rocky Raymond was in attendance and along with Wrestler Chris Duffy were ready to pummel King (who is quite small for a wrestler)but Brown got in between them knowing he had no chance against either one but especially not both, so that they could get to their vehicle and get out of there alive. Brown was laughing the entire time, but sad that someone would do something so devious and low especially at a Kowalski show. Brown is one of three female professional Wrestlers that broke her neck and resumed her career for many, many years after healing.

The takeover was controversial, with opponents of the deal, such as the former First Sea Lord and Royal Navy chief Admiral Lord West expressing fears. The founding family of Cobham were also vocal opponents of the takeover. These oppositions for the takeover triggered an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), on the national security implications of the transaction, which led to the delay in the regulatory approval of the deal.

The Bottleneck is a narrow couloir, which is overhung by seracs from the ice field east of the summit. The couloir is located only below the summit, and climbers have to traverse about exposed to the seracs to pass it. Due to the height of , and the steepness of 50 to 60 degrees, this stretch is the most dangerous part of the route.K2climb.net, The climb from the Pakistan side According to AdventureStats, 13 out of the last 14 fatalities on K2 have occurred at or near the Bottleneck.K2 fatalities adventurestats.com. Retrieved 18 October 2011. Despite all the dangers, the Bottleneck is still technically the easiest and the fastest route to the summit. Most climbers choose to use it to minimize time required to spend above (the \\"death zone\\"). The standard route, the Abruzzi Spur (SE), as well as the Cesen route (SSE Ridge, which joins SE Ridge), and the American variety on the NE Ridge (traverse across E Face to SE Ridge), all attain the summit via the Bottleneck. The climbers approaching the bottleneck start from a shoulder, on almost level ground just below 8000 m, where typically the highest camp is located. The bottom end of the couloir drops to the south face of the mountain, and it gradually steepens to 60 degrees just below the ice field. It is not possible to climb up the icefield, which rises straight up tens of metres, but one has to traverse leftwards at the bottom of the icefield until it is possible to pass the icefield. It is possible to bypass the Bottleneck by rock-climbing the cliffs on the left. However, due to the technical difficulty of this approach, it has only been done once, by Fritz Wiessner and Pasang Dawa Lama Sherpa on the 1939 American Karakoram expedition.

Such closed valleys may arise in limestone or karst landscapes, where a layer of permeable rock lies above an impermeable substrate such as marl. Water flowing through a steephead valley leaves via one or more ponors or sinkholes. Blind valleys are typically dry at their lower ends. If the ponor cannot contain the high runoff during a flood event an intermittent flow may continue through the valley beyond the sink. Such a landform is called a semi-blind or half-blind valley. Development They are created by a stream flowing within the permeable rock and eroding it from within, until the rock above collapses opening up a steep narrow valley which is then further eroded by the stream running across the impermeable valley floor. At the head of the valley the stream emerges from the rock as a spring.

It was released worldwide for all platforms in April 2009. The game is based on the 1974 film The Godfather Part II, and is a sequel to the 2006 game The Godfather, which was based on the 1972 film of the same name. As with the 2006 game, The Godfather II tells the story of an original character, Dominic, who is placed in charge of the Corleone family operations in New York City when the protagonist of the original game, Aldo Trapani, is killed in Cuba. As with the first game, Dominic's original story intersects with the narrative of the film on multiple occasions. However, the game changes the film's plot more so than the first game did: none of the material concerning the rise of Vito Corleone is present in the game, and the events of the film are presented in a different order. Additionally, whereas in the first game, most of Aldo's actions took the form of events which happened off-screen in the first film, in The Godfather II, Dominic has a more central role, appearing in numerous scenes in which he was not present in the film; for example, he is with Frank Pentangeli during his attempted assassination, he accompanies Tom Hagen to see Pat Geary after the prostitute is found dead, and he, rather than Rocco Lampone, assassinates Hyman Roth. Robert Duvall reprises his role from the films and the first game as Tom Hagen, but Al Pacino, who played Michael Corleone in the film, is absent in both likeness and voice, having signed an exclusive contract with Vivendi Universal Games to appear in their 2006 game Scarface: The World Is Yours. The Godfather II received mixed to negative reviews across all platforms. Common criticisms included graphical glitches, technical bugs, poor AI, and an unimaginative open world design. Many critics also felt the game deviated too much from both the plot and tone of the film, and that it was too easy and too short. It was a commercial failure, selling less than 400,000 units worldwide across all platforms. Its poor critical and commercial performance led EA to scrap plans to adapt the third film. Gameplay The Godfather II is an open world action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective, in which the player controls Dominic, Don of the Corleone family in New York City, and Michael Corleone's underboss. The basic gameplay and game mechanics fall into the subgenre of Grand Theft Auto clones, as the player can travel throughout the game world freely, commandeer vehicles, do whatever they want in terms of attacking and/or killing innocent civilians, and progress through the storyline at their own leisure, spending as much time traversing the city as they wish. Combat HUD shows the mini-map on the bottom right, Dominic's currently selected weapon and ammo on the bottom left, his health, and funds on the top left, and his currently targeted opponent's health on the top right. Below his own health bar are the heath bars of his made men, as well as icons indicating their specialties. Much of the game is based around third- person shooting, with the player able to wield a pistol, a magnum, a tommy gun, a shotgun, and a sniper rifle, as well as projectiles such as molotov cocktails and dynamite. The game features both a lock-on system and a manual aiming system. In the manual system, the player has complete freedom to aim wherever they wish. In the lock-on system, the player can lock onto a target, but still has a certain degree of freedom to aim manually; the targeting reticule can be moved around the locked on target, allowing the player to target specific areas. If the reticule turns red, the player has found a weak point. All enemies have four weak points - their two knees and their two shoulders. If the player shoots one of their knees, the enemy will no longer be able to run, but will continue to shoot back. If the player hits a shoulder, the enemy won't be able to fire back or fight. The other mode of combat in the game is melee combat, which is very similar to the \\"BlackHand\\" system used in the first game. Once the player has locked onto an NPC, either hostile or non-hostile, they can use the right analog stick or the shoulder buttons to engage in melee combat. The system allows for light attacks, heavy attacks, powered attacks, and directional attacks. It also allows the player to swing the opponent around, drag them, strangle them, lift them to their feet if they fall to their knees, slam them against walls, smash their head against counters, throw them over ledges and out windows, and perform execution maneuvers when the opponent is suitably weakened. Players can also wield numerous melee weapons, such as baseball bats, tire irons, police batons, and snooker cues. Extortion and family A major part of The Godfather IIs gameplay is extorting businesses. When the player is attempting to intimidate a business owner into paying protection money, a meter appears on screen with two red bars. To get the owner to agree to pay, the player must intimidate them until the meter fills up to the first bar. After this point, the more intimidation the player can achieve, the more money the owner will pay out. However, if the meter passes the second red bar, the owner will begin to fight back and will refuse to pay anything. Every business owner has a weak point, something they particularly fear, and if the player finds it, the amount of money paid out will rise faster than the meter fills, allowing the player to extort more money before the meter reaches the second red bar. Intimidation methods include beating the owner up, throwing them around, smashing their shop, hanging them off ledges, attacking customers, or pointing firearms at them. A new element of gameplay in The Godfather II is \\"Crime Rings\\". Every business is part of a larger multi-business crime ring, and once the player has taken over every business in a given crime ring, they receive a gameplay bonus. For example, taking over every business in a diamond smuggling ring will give all members of the player's family bulletproof vests, taking over all businesses in a drug ring will double the player's income from each individual extorted business, taking over all businesses in a chop shop ring will give the player access to armored vehicles, etc. However, these bonuses are also available to any rival family who controls the crime ring, until the player takes over any single business within the ring, then the bonus disappears. For either the player or a rival family to receive the crime ring bonus, they must control every business in the crime ring, but to lose the bonus, they need lose only one business. To ensure the player does not lose extorted businesses, they must assign guards. Every business the player has extorted is open to attack from rival families, and if the business is unguarded, it will be lost. If a rival family successfully takes back a business, they will break the crime ring, and the player will lose their bonus. Ultimately, the player must tackle the rival family's strongest holdout - their compound. Once the compound is destroyed, that family has been defeated. To destroy a compound, the player must first unlock it by taking over all of the family's businesses. They must then fight their way inside and plant a bomb. Each compound is heavily guarded by opposing family members. Another new gameplay aspect in The Godfather II is the squad mechanic, whereby the player can directly command a group of made men. Each made man has one or more special skills; \\"Arsonist\\" (can set fire to various locations), \\"Demolitions\\" (can rig bombs on cars and buildings), \\"Bruiser\\" (can smash certain locked doors and perform stealth kills on enemies), \\"Safecracker\\" (can open safes and certain locked doors), \\"Engineer\\" (can cut through fences and deactivate communications in enemy businesses, meaning they cannot call for backup) and \\"Medic\\" (can revive Dominic and other made men if their health is reduced to zero during combat). When a made man is hired, they start at the lowest rank; soldato. A total of four soldato can be hired, with the player able to promote two to the rank of capo, thus leaving room to hire two more soldato. When a made man is promoted to capo, they are granted an additional special skill, and become more powerful. The player can also promote one capo to the rank of underboss, giving him another special skill and further enhancing his strength. Although the player can have a total of seven made-men working for him, only three can be active in his crew at any one time. The inactive men can be sent to guard businesses or attack rival businesses. Don's View in The Godfather II. In this image, the player has selected \\"Basso Oil Fill & Go\\". The information on the left indicates that this business is part of a gun smuggling crime ring which, if the player owns all businesses within it, will grant access to larger ammo clips. To manage their crime rings, and get an overview of their empire, players have access to a semi-interactive map called the \\"Don's View.\\" Presented in a 3D perspective, with a rotatable/zoomable isometric three-quarter top-down view, the Don's View allows players to examine rival businesses to see how many guards are present, select the number of guards to place at their own businesses, send family members to bomb or try to take over a rival business, set waypoints, organize their own family, manage their finances, upgrade Dominic's skills, promote and fire made men, and examine collectibles. Heat and favors As in the first game, the player must be aware of \\"heat\\" at all times. Shooting rival family members in public, killing innocent people, or attacking police officers will all raise heat levels. If the level gets too high, police will fire upon the player on sight. To avoid this, the player can bribe police to ignore them for a while. The game also introduces witnesses. When the player commits a crime, a yellow circle appears on the mini-map. This is the crime scene, and police will soon arrive to investigate. On occasion, a member of the public will be willing to identify the player to the police. If this happens when the player is still within the yellow circle, the police will attack. To avoid this, the player can either intimidate or bribe witnesses into not talking before the police arrive on the scene. Another new aspect of The Godfather II is the favor system. Players can do favors for ordinary people on the street either for money or for information on how to assassinate rival family made men. Like the Corleone family, all of the other families have made men. If the player simply shoots a made man, he will be hospitalized, not killed. To permanently eliminate a made man, the player must meet his \\"kill condition\\"; that is, he must be killed in a specific way, such as being thrown from the roof of a building, hit by a car or killed using a certain execution maneuver. The only way the player can learn these kill conditions, and the location of each made man, is by doing favors for people on the street. The player can also do favors for various influential people, such as police chiefs, politicians, CIA agents, judges and DAs. Doing favors for these people grants the player bonuses which they can cash in at any time. These bonuses include instantly reducing heat to zero, instantly healing hospitalized made men, putting enemy made men in prison for a time, and instantly rebuilding bombed businesses. Multiplayer In online multiplayer, players do not control Dominic, but one of his made men from single-player mode. Multiplayer can support up to sixteen players in eight-versus-eight man teams. However, the abilities of the made man are important to the type of game mode, although there is also a standard deathmatch mode. Other modes are \\"Firestarter\\" (which is designed with the arsonist in mind, where players gain bonuses by starting fires), \\"Safecracker\\" (designed for safecrackers, where players must open and then defend a safe from the other team), and \\"Demo Assault\\" (where demolition experts must destroy pre-designated targets in their opponents base). Additionally, each time the player uses one of their skills, they gain in-game cash. If a player uses their made man's skill enough times in a game, they gain honors, which can be used to unlock new weapons in both multiplayer and single-player modes. All cash acquired in multiplayer is also carried over to single-player mode. Plot The game begins in Havana on December 31, 1958, roughly three years after the closing events of the previous game. Hyman Roth (Danny Jacobs) has called a meeting in Cuba to celebrate the Mafia's success in their partnership with the government of Fulgencio Batista. Attending the meeting are Michael Corleone (Carlos Ferro), his brother Fredo (John Mariano), his underboss Aldo Trapani (Rick Pasqualone), and Trapani's caporegime, Dominic (Chris Cox), as well as representatives of the Granados and Mangano families, amongst others. Roth announces that when he retires, he plans to divide up his Cuban businesses between the families. However, later that night, Batista resigns from office, as the Cuban Revolution proves successful. Michael, Aldo, Fredo and Dominic run for a nearby airport, but Aldo is assassinated. The others escape, and Michael believes with Aldo gone, the smaller families may try to usurp the Corleone businesses in New York City. Fredo offers to take Aldo's place, but Michael ignores him, telling him to make sure Aldo's mother is taken care of financially, and instead he appoints Dominic as Aldo's replacement. Six weeks later, Michael, Dominic and Fredo are meeting caporegime Frank Pentangeli (Gavin Hammon), who is complaining about the Rosato brothers, Carmine and Tony. Formerly capos under Peter Clemenza, they have formed their own families and are, amongst other things, dealing drugs. Pentangeli wants them both dead, but Michael refuses. Instead, he tells Dominic to send Carmine a message by taking over some of his protection rackets, and assassinating several of his made men. Soon, Carmine (Joe Paulino) contacts Dominic to offer peace. Dominic and Frank meet him, but Carmine tries to have them shot. Frank is apparently killed, with the assassin saying \\"Michael Corleone says hello,\\" but Dominic escapes and confronts Michael, who denies being behind the hit. Soon thereafter, Dominic kills Carmine. Dominic is invited to Florida by Roth. He is met by Fredo, who has been sent by Michael to manage a hotel. Dominic thinks Roth wants to talk about Tony Rosato, who has become active in Florida, but instead he needs Dominic's help in dealing with the Granados family. Don Rico Granados (Vic Polizos) is highly connected with politicians, and Roth needs Dominic to weaken the family by taking over their businesses and assassinating their made men. At the same time, Dominic goes after Tony Rosato, who he chases back to New York, and ultimately kills. At the Corleone compound, Michael tells Dominic a senate committee is building a case against the family and has acquired a key witness - Frank Pentangeli, who survived the assassination attempt, believing he had been betrayed by Michael. Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is no longer Corleone consigliere, as he is now Michael's lawyer, and Michael wants him removed from Corleone operations. As such, he is to be Dominic's consigliere. Hagen tells Dominic they need to get a senator on their side; Pat Geary (Chris Edgerly), who is obsessed with prostitutes, and frequents a local brothel. They set Geary up so he awakens with a dead prostitute, and Tom and Dominic promise him the girl will disappear, as long as he offers his friendship to the Corleones. Geary agrees, advising Dominic the Mangano family are planning to start operating in Miami. Michael warns Dominic not to make an enemy of Don Samuele Mangano (Ralph Peduto), so Dominic offers him a partnership, which he accepts. Meanwhile, Dominic bombs the Granados compound and kills Rico. Subsequently, Fredo and Dominic are almost killed in a drive- by shooting. Fredo blames Samuele for the hit, urging Dominic to exact revenge. He does so, taking over Mangano's warehouse in Florida. An outraged Samuele denies he ordered the hit, and declares war against Dominic's family. Dominic asks Roth for advice, who tells him he can reason with Mangano, if Dominic is willing to help him out. Roth still believes the Cuban deal is possible, and his associate, CIA agent Henry Mitchell (Peter Hulne), tells Dominic the CIA want Fidel Castro dead so they can bring back Batista. Mitchell proposes that Dominic travel to Cuba and kill Castro. Dominic is concerned that Michael is unaware of any of this, but Roth assures him that Michael is too busy with the senate hearings. Dominic heads to Cuba and tries to kill Castro, but is prevented by Don Esteban Almeida (Sasha Roiz), who knew he was coming. Dominic manages to escape Cuba, but as his plane leaves, Roth arrives and ensures Almeida the assassination attempt will not interrupt their plans. Back in New York, Michael demands to know why Dominic and Fredo didn't turn to him after the Manganos tried to have them killed. Fredo reveals Roth was behind everything; it was all planned to get Dominic to Cuba to kill Castro so Roth and Almeida could align with Batista. Fed up of being ridiculed and ignored, Fredo agreed to help Roth, who had promised him his own family. Furious, Michael disowns Fredo. Meanwhile, Michael is worried about Pentangeli's testimony, and has his brother, Vincenzo (Ralph Peduto) brought over from Sicily, hoping to shame Frank into not testifying. Dominic learns Roth has had Vincenzo kidnapped, but is able to rescue him in time for Pentangeli's testimony. Frank doesn't testify against Michael, and Geary dismisses the hearing. After the hearing, Michael decides he wants all Corleone enemies dead; Mitchell, Roth, the Almeidas and the Manganos. After eliminating the two remaining families and killing Mitchell in Cuba, Dominic turns his attention to Roth, who Geary has had extradited from Cuba on corruption charges. Dominic heads to the airport, and after a shootout with Roth's guards, airport security and police, Dominic kills Roth and escapes. Michael and Tom congratulate him, telling him the war is over, and he will now be known as Dominic Corleone. The game ends with Dominic shooting Fredo in the back of the head on a fishing boat. Development The development of the sequel was unofficially revealed on May 17, 2007 when Nollenberger Capital Partners analyst Todd Greenwald sent out a note to investors recapping a recent visit he had paid to EA Redwood Shores. In the note, he spoke mainly about The Simpsons Game, but also mentioned a sequel to The Godfather was in the very early stages of development. Greenwald also stated the open world game engine used in the first Godfather game was also being used in The Simpsons Game, The Godfather sequel, and three other games; \\"the open-world engine was built from the ground up for The Godfather, and is now being used by five different franchises, including The Simpsons. The Godfather 2 is also in development currently, though timing is unknown\\". In July, at Electronic Arts' annual shareholders meeting, a shareholder asked Frank Gibeau, head of EA Games, about the company's attitude to M-rated titles, to which Gibeau replied \\"The appeal of those types of games is growing as the demographics start to open up for that older demographic. We make products like Godfather 2, Army of Two, Crysis -- a lot of products that appeal to that older customer.\\" Nothing more was heard about the game until June 2008, when John Riccitiello, CEO of Electronic Arts, commented at an investors meeting, \\"you can play [Godfather II] both at the street level, much like a GTA-style game, but you can also play it top-down, almost like you're in an RTS, controlling the strategy of the boroughs so you can see what's going on.\\" On August 7, Xbox World 360 ran a story featuring information on the as yet still officially unannounced title. According to the article, the game would be \\"Scarface meets Total War\\", and would feature an open world environment combined with RPG and RTS elements. The article revealed the game would take place in New York City, Miami and Havana, and would once again feature extortion of business owners as a central gameplay element. It also revealed information about the crew mechanic, character classes, crime ring bonuses, and the basics of the favor system. In a press release on August 8, EA officially announced the game, which would be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and was slated for a February 2009 release. In the press release, EA stated Speaking of \\"Don's View\\", executive producer Hunter Smith stated EA first showed the game on August 14, in a non-playable beta build of the Xbox 360 version. They revealed their main design strategy had been \\"Act like a mobster, think like a Don;\\" they wanted to enhance the features from the first game, such as extortion methods and shooting, but also include an element whereby the player would be able to control their entire family on a larger scale. They also revealed Robert Duvall was reprising the role of Tom Hagen from the films and the first game, but, as in the first game, Al Pacino would not be appearing in voice or likeness in the role of Michael Corleone. A major concern for the developers was the behavior of the other families. Whereas in Godfather, the other families were relatively inactive, and simply waited for the player to attack them, in Godfather II, they are more proactive and will attack the player, and each other, on a regular basis. In the first game, once a player took over a business, they couldn't lose that business. However, in Godfather II, the other families are constantly trying to retake businesses from the player. The developers also explained the crime ring bonus system was built using an \\"under-the-hood\\" battle card model, whereby different perks are awarded for different rings owned, which determines how the families act. However, they emphasized the card game element only serves as the basis for the logic system that drives the behavior of the families, it is not actually a part of the game itself. In November, EA showcased a playable alpha build of the game. Addressing the fact that the game deviated from the film's story more so than the original game, they stated they had taken some \\"creative liberties\\" so as to focus more on Dominic's actions. They felt that in the first game, Aldo's story and the \\"film story\\" were divorced too much from one another, and they wanted to ensure this didn't happen in the sequel. As a result, the game is not a direct retelling of the film, but instead non-canonically places Dominic directly into scenes in which he was not present in the film. They also consciously gave Fredo a much more central role than he has in the film, having him leave Cuba with Michael rather than staying behind. On January 8, EA announced the game would be released in North America on February 24, and in Europe on February 27. However, on February 3, the release date was pushed back to April. John Riccitiello explained the decision was taken because the original February release date was seen as too cluttered, and EA felt that by pushing it back, The Godfather II would have better luck in the market. On February 11, new release dates were announced; April 7 in North America and April 10 in Europe. The game went gold on March 9. On March 18, EA announced a new multiplayer option, which would be available as a free patch immediately upon the release of the game. Called \\"Don Control\\", it would be a new option available for all pre-existing multiplayer modes. Don Control lets one player from each team view the battle field from above, but not participate directly in the combat. As the Don, this player can drop waypoints anywhere, directing their teammates to strategic areas. Additionally, specific areas of the map, called \\"capture nods,\\" can be controlled by either team. Once controlled by a team, the Don can activate the nod to do one of three things; give a health boost, give an armored vest, or explode when members of the enemy team approach. The mode also lets Dons wager in-game cash prior to the commencement of the battle. Dons sets the amount they wish to wager, and how much they will give to their team should they win. However, if a player loses, all cash wagered will be removed from their single-player campaign. Marketing In March 2009, EA launched a Facebook app, called The Godfather II: Crime Rings to help promote the game. Based on the crime ring mechanic from the game, the app allowed players to create a mobster and take over rackets, building crime rings and eventually becoming Don. Players were randomly placed into one of the five families from the game (Corleone, Rosato, Granados, Mangano and Almeida) upon joining the app. In early April, EA sent out brass knuckles to game journalists to promote the game. However, brass knuckles are illegal to own in several states. Realizing their mistake, EA requested everyone who received the knuckles return them. On April 9, EA opened a space for The Godfather II on the PlayStation 3's online service PlayStation Home. The space offered users five poker tables for No Limit Texas hold 'em, with promotional videos and concept art available for viewing. Downloadable content On April 1, EA revealed details of the first premium DLC, which would be made available on April 23. The \\"Petangeli Map Pack\\" would feature new Cuba and junkyard multiplayer maps. The \\"Level 4 Weapons Bundle\\" would feature level four upgrades for all weapons. The \\"Jack of All Trades Pack\\" would feature Jimmy Lira, an arsonist/engineer/medic/safecracker equipped with a level two tommy gun. The \\"Corleone Bundle\\" would include all of the premium content in one pack. EA shut down their servers for the game on April 13, 2012, with all online games becoming unavailable and all DLC packs removed from the PlayStation Store and Xbox Games Store. Reception The Godfather II received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" across all systems; the PC version holds an aggregate score of 63 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on twenty-nine reviews; the PlayStation 3 version 67 out of 100, based on fifty-three reviews; the Xbox 360 version 65 out of 100, based on seventy-two reviews. IGN's Jeff Haynes scored the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 version 7.7 out of 10, and the PC version 7.6 out of 10, writing \\"The Godfather II provides a good dose of entertainment, but the lack of difficulty holds the game back from truly becoming a great crime game.\\" Although he praised the mix of action and strategy, he criticized the game as \\"way too easy\\" for both action and RTS fans. He also found numerous technical and graphical glitches; \\"characters will frequently find themselves stuck on objects or within walls [...] shadows which has look horrendous, loads of texture pop-in and rendering issues which stand out like a sore thumb.\\" He concluded \\"It's still fun and has almost all of the elements of a great game, but until a harder difficulty level is added, The Godfather II falls a tad short.\\" Game Informers Andrew Reiner scored the PlayStation 3 version 5.5 out of 10, and was critical of the use of the license, especially the frequent use of nudity. He wrote the game \\"draws more comparisons to the raunchy teen film Porky's than the masterful gangster story [...] The foundation is certainly here for an amusing dating game, but I honestly don't see how this content fits with The Godfather.\\" He too was critical of graphical glitches, citing \\"two character models occupying the same space,\\" \\"shooting the bottom crate in a stack, only to see the others float magically in the air,\\" vehicles appearing and disappearing at random, and \\"bullets blocked by invisible barriers.\\" He praised the strategic elements of the game, but wrote \\"The problematic gameplay, unfaithful story, and array of graphical glitches create an experience I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy, which is a shame since all of the tasks associated with being the Don of a family are handled nicely.\\" GameSpot's Justin Calvert scored the game 4.5 out of 10. He too was critical of the license, writing \\"If The Godfather II had been a mediocre, mindless action flick, the game of the same name could at least be considered faithful to its source material. As it is, though, Coppola's Mafia-themed masterpiece has been reduced to an uninspired, repetitive open-world action game.\\" He criticized the game as being \\"released in an unfinished state, riddled with performance issues and bugs,\\" and stated \\"the problem with almost every aspect of The Godfather II is simply that it feels unfinished. Dated visuals, voiced lines of dialogue that seemingly play at random and often inappropriate times, dead bodies falling through scenery, a car hovering in the air [...] cars and pedestrians that appear and disappear long before they leave your range of vision [...] - these are just some of the problems we encountered.\\" He concluded \\"all you're going to find is repetitive, unsatisfying gameplay in an illogical, inconsistent world.\\" GameSpy's Allen Rausch scored the game 2 out of 5, calling it \\"just too bloody easy.\\" He too criticized the design of the gameworld; \\"Godfather II commits one of the biggest sins of any sandbox-style game: being a boring and ugly sandbox. From an artistic standpoint, New York, Miami and Cuba are ugly, low- poly worlds filled with cookie-cutter design elements [...] The Godfather IIs blah burgs come off looking like test levels the devs put together using an engine left over from the PS2 era.\\" He concluded by calling the game a missed opportunity; \\"there's absolutely nothing wrong with the game in concept, and done properly, it would easily have established it as a classic on par with the film on which it's based. Instead we get brilliant concepts ham-handedly executed.\\" Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored the game 4 out of 10, accusing it of \\"strangely lacking in soul, and consistently failing to make you care about what you're doing and why.\\" He also found the game too easy; \\"there's rarely any requirement to play the game skillfully. You just charge in all-guns- blazing, snap between targets with the hugely generous auto-aim facility and blitz one obliging enemy after another. At the core there remains an enjoyably precise combat system, but EA has predictably pandered to the mysterious demands of the audience of players who want games to be played for them and want zero challenge [...] the sight of you and your AI buddies charging around getting raked with gunfire and sprinting away unharmed is a pathetic sight, and smacks of game designers not even bothering to try anymore.\\" He concluded \\"this is a stark return to the EA of old, where a treasured licence is butchered irredeemably. Lacking both a challenge and soul, and failing to even engage on a narrative level, what you're left with is an overly forgiving shooter with weak strategy elements.\\" Sales and cancelled sequel The game was a commercial failure. In North America, by the end of April, the Xbox 360 version had sold 155,000 units, and the PlayStation 3 version 91,000. After the poor critical and commercial reception of the game, EA announced they had abandoned plans to adapt the third film.

Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1990. he played no further cricket outside England until after the Second World War. He appeared quite regularly for MCC in 1929 and 1930; his best bowling return for them was the 7/43 he claimed in the first innings against the Royal Navy at Chatham in July 1929, while his highest score was the 97 he made against the Army in August 1930. In 1931 Martin made a rather low-key Worcestershire debut, taking two wickets and scoring 4 against the New Zealanders. He began his County Championship career the following season, and remained a stalwart of the side until the outbreak of war. He just failed to score his thousand first-class runs for the season in 1932, but reached the landmark every year from 1933 to 1939, while in both 1937 and 1939 he achieved the double. His most productive year with the bat was 1935, in which he hit five centuries, including his career best, a first- innings 191* versus Northamptonshire. As a bowler, he three times took eight wickets in an innings, the best of these returns (and the best of his career) being the 8/24 he claimed against Sussex in August 1939, with match figures of 13/88. The war then intervened, and indeed he never played first-class cricket in England again. His next appearance was back with Natal, playing against Transvaal in a match starting on Boxing Day 1945. He played a full Currie Cup campaign with Natal in 1946/47, and in November 1946 took 5/32 against Griqualand West. From 1947/48 until the end of his career in 1949/50, Martin represented Rhodesia, now having moved to live there. For them, his best performance was the 6/49 he took against a touring MCC side at Salisbury in February 1949. He captained the Rhodesia team on four occasions. Although he never acted as an umpire in a first-class match, he did stand (with Paul Gibb) in Worcestershire's centenary single-innings game against MCC in 1965. Other than his nephew Hugh Tayfield (mentioned above) three of Martin's other relatives played first-class cricket: his son Hugh Martin, and two other nephews Arthur Tayfield and Cyril Tayfield.

(Dui hua, is pinyin for the Chinese word meaning \\"dialogue\\"). Focusing on political and religious prisoners, juvenile justice, women in prison, and criminal justice and death penalty reform, Dui Hua's work rests on the premise that positive change is realized through constructive relationships and exchange.  Background  Dui Hua was founded in April 1999 by John Kamm, a former businessman who also serves as the organization's chairman and executive director. Strong relationships built during his time as a businessman and senior officer of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong helped Kamm build a mutually respectful human rights dialogue with Chinese officials, judges, and legal experts. Having intervened independently on behalf of political and religious prisoners in China since 1990, Kamm founded Dui Hua in an effort to raise public awareness about human rights issues in China and supplement his advocacy work with expert exchange, research, publications, and community engagement.The Dui Hua Foundation has offices located in San Francisco and Hong Kong. Inheriting Kamm's close relations with the Chinese government, Dui Hua has also forged strong partnerships with officials from the European Union, the United States, Norway, Switzerland, Denmark, Australia, Sweden, the Netherlands and other countries that hold human rights dialogues and consultations with China. Dui Hua's staff frequently travels to Europe, China, and Hong Kong to further strengthen its political partnerships and advocacy efforts and remain engaged in the international human rights community. The Dui Hua Foundation has offices located in San Francisco and Hong Kong.  Special Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council  In 2005, Dui Hua was granted \\"special consultative status\\" with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), allowing Dui Hua staff to attend meetings of the ECOSOC and related bodies and submit statements and reports. Dui Hua is the only independent, overseas nongovernmental organization focused on China's human rights that holds this status. With its consultative status, Dui Hua has participated in UN sessions including the Human Rights Council and Universal Periodic Review and collaborates with UN Special Procedures mandated Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and the Special Rapporteur on Torture, among others.  Programs  Dui Hua seeks clemency and better treatment for at-risk detainees in China through the promotion of universally recognized human rights in a well-informed, mutually respectful dialogue with China (link to mission statement on website). The foundation focuses specifically on political and religious prisoners, juvenile justice, women in prison, and criminal justice and death penalty reform. Political and religious prisoners Dui Hua's prisoner-advocacy work began as an effort to uncover the names and secure the early release of activists imprisoned during the massacre of the pro-democracy demonstrators on June 4, 1989 in Tiananmen Square. Over the years, Dui Hua's scope has broadened to encompass research and advocacy relevant to individuals detained in China for the non-violent expression of their freedom of speech and association. Dui Hua maintains a secure Political Prisoner Database with information on more than 35,000 political and religious prisoners incarcerated in China since 1980. (Though most would have been released and are not currently serving prison sentences.) Dui Hua researchers use mostly open- source materials in libraries and on the Internet, Dui Hua collects information on political dissidents, religious practitioners, ethnic minorities, and petitioners who have been convicted of non-violent crimes of speech and association. Dui Hua directly advocates for individual prisoners by preparing lists of political and religious prisoners believed to be incarcerated in China. Drawing on its prisoner database and years of experience in the selection and presentation of cases, Dui Hua produces many lists each year to be delivered to the Chinese government either directly or through countries and organizations that hold human rights dialogues with China. As a vehicle for expressing concern about individual cases, the lists have directly contributed to better treatment and early release for hundreds of prisoners. Since its formation, Dui Hua has helped many political and religious prisoners earn sentence reductions, paroles, and early releases. They include, Ngawang Sangdrol, Jigme Sangpo, Xue Feng, Dr. Xu Zerong, Professor Chen Taihe, and Sandy Phan-Gillis. In an interview with Hong Kong's Open Magazine in 2011, Dr. Xu talked about his transfer to a better prison and improved overall treatment and said, \\"All of this was the result of Kamm's negotiations with the authorities.\\" Dui Hua was active in uncovering and releasing information about the Yahoo! Internet cases of Chinese journalist Shi Tao and three other dissidents including Wang Xiaoning. Juvenile justice Dui Hua is believed to be the first foreign NGO to host a juvenile justice expert exchange with China's Supreme People's Court (SPC) and since 2008, Dui Hua has hosted four such exchanges. In 2008, Dui Hua arranged for a delegation of six Chinese judges to visit US juvenile courts, detention facilities, and other institutions. As a testament to its success, the SPC invited Dui Hua to send a return delegation to China in 2010. In 2012, Dui Hua hosted a delegation from the Supreme People's Court on a week-long study tour in the San Francisco Bay Area. The delegation was made up of SPC judges as well as judges from courts across China. In 2014, Dui Hua was invited to Beijing for an exchange with the SPC; the exchange focused on the importance of record sealing in allowing juveniles more equal access to educational and job opportunities for the future. These exchanges have contributed to reformative steps in China's juvenile justice system in areas such as record sealing, diversion, and behavioral and psychological assessments of juvenile offenders. Dui Hua's close working relationship with the SPC ensures that future criminal and juvenile justice initiatives will take place, leading to more concrete systemic reforms. Women in prison Dui Hua actively promotes reform in the area of women prisoners in China. The organization held an expert-led seminar in Hong Kong on the Bangkok Rules (Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders) in February 2014. In 2016, Dui Hua partnered with Penal Reform International and translated into Chinese an e-course on sections of Bangkok Rules . Dui Hua also exposes the plight of incarcerated women in China through its research and publications. In February 2016, the foundation published an investigative piece based on extensive and ongoing research on the ever-rising number of women in Chinese prisons. The findings indicate a rise in the female prison population. Criminal justice Dui Hua regularly engages in dialogue with both Chinese and international government officials and experts on China's Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law (CPL). On November 3, 2011, Kamm testified to the US House Committee on Foreign Affairs on behalf of political prisoners following the release of proposed amendments to the CPL. Dui Hua has actively promoted death penalty reform in China since 2005. Since 2011, Dui Hua has released what is believed to be the most accurate statistics on the number of yearly executions in China. Dui Hua believes that approximately 4,000 executions took place in China in 2011, down about 50 percent since the Supreme People's Court regained its power of final review over death sentences in 2007. Dui Hua's estimate garnered widespread media coverage and was cited as \\"rare data\\" by Agence France-Presse. Since 2009, the foundation has maintained an internal log of death sentences and executions in China. Dui Hua estimated that there had been 2,000 executions in 2016, the figure attracted widespread attention from the media.  Publications  Dui Hua regularly posts commentary, analysis, and translation about human rights and rule of law in China on its blog, Human Rights Journal. It also publishes Digest, a monthly newsletter featuring news on human rights issues relevant to the foundation's mission and recent activities. Digest articles cover topics such as bilateral human rights dialogues with China, developments in US-China relations, human rights concerns shared by the United States and China, prisoner updates, and research findings. Dui Hua's Digest also features the series John Kamm Remembers, where Executive Director John Kamm shares stories from his human rights activism on behalf of political prisoners prior to and since Dui Hua's establishment in 1999. Reference Materials is an online publication consisting of information on prisoner cases, criminal justice statistics and regulations, and commentaries uncovered by Dui Hua's researchers in open-source publications and documents issued or approved by Chinese government bodies.

This view was advocated in contrast to that of William Lloyd Garrison who advocated opposing the constitution on the grounds that it supported slavery. In the pamphlet, Spooner shows that none of the state governments of the slave states specifically authorized slavery, that the U.S. Constitution contains several clauses that are contradictory with slavery, that slavery was a violation of natural law, and that the intentions of the Constitutional Convention have no legal bearing on the document they created. Thus, Spooner's position is one that employs original meaning-styled textualism and rejects original intent-styled originalism. History This work is considered to be a work of sophistry or political strategy which aimed to win support from inconsistently-anti-slavery or \\"fence-sitting\\" Northerners whose sympathies were squarely on the side of the Constitution, but who opposed slavery on a mixed and inconsistent basis (Spooner believed that the Constitution was \\"of no Authority,\\" as his later essay \\"No Treason Volume VI: The Constitution of No Authority\\" revealed). As a strategic approach, it was adopted by Frederick Douglass, who delivered its core message to thousands of Northerners in his speeches and writings. This greatly legitimized the abolitionist message, making it far more effective than it had been under Garrison's more \\"anarchic\\" message. Spooner took this course because the abolition of slavery was vastly more morally important to him than the consistent defense of \\"anti-Constitutionalism.\\" In summary, Spooner saw that, without gaining adherents, slavery could not be abolished, and he saw that adherents could not be gained without (regardless of accuracy) implying that the Constitution was legitimate and that people should care about what it says. Though this may appear dishonest, it is a consequentialist position that simply acknowledged an important reality: the existing human social and political networks of the time were not morally intelligent enough to choose abolition on their own. They needed to be successfully tricked into doing so from a position of knowledge greater than their own, so Spooner tricked them.

The city is located southwest of St. John's, on the eastern tip of the Avalon Peninsula on the island of Newfoundland. Mount Pearl is part of the St. John's metropolitan area, the 20th largest metropolitan area in Canada. History Mount Pearl dates back to 1829, when Commander James Pearl and his wife, Lady Anne Pearl, arrived in Newfoundland with a Crown grant of one thousand acres (4 km¬≤) of land, a reward for Commander Pearl's 27 years of distinguished service in the Royal Navy. In 1830, Commander Pearl built a house upon the most elevated section of his estate and named it Mount Cochrane in honour of then-governor Sir Thomas Cochrane. After the governor left Newfoundland, Pearl renamed the site Mount Pearl. Pearl was made a Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order of Hanover and received the honour of Knight Bachelor from Queen Victoria. He died suddenly at his Mount Pearl estate on January 13, 1840, at the age of 50 years. In 1844, Sir James Pearl's wife, Lady Anne, moved to London, England. John Lester, who had come from Devonshire, England to work for James Pearl, continued working the Pearl Estate, leasing it from Lady Anne Pearl for another 14 years. In her will, she left John Lester of land called \\"Anna Vale\\", (present day Glendale) which he later sold. The Pearl estate eventually came into the hands of Andrew Glendenning, who worked it as successful farmland well into the 1920s. John Lester purchased other land (124 acres opposite the Pearl Estate on Brookfield Road) from Edward Dunscomb and later inherited another on Old Placentia Road (present day Admiralty Wood) from Pearl's sister, Eunice Blamey. John Lester died in 1893 leaving his estate, called \\"FairMead\\", to sons Ashton and James. Fairmead is the site of Lester's Market today. Development In the 1930s and 1940s, Mount Pearl became the meeting place of affluent members of society and lovers of horseracing. A large open air gallery, with benches for spectators to view surrounding lands was erected on \\"The Mount\\" in the 1940s. Horseracing continued to be prominent and Mount Pearl began to develop into something of a summer resort for St. John's residents. Increased population during summer months led to increased population year round and eventual residential and industrial development. Incorporation With the population growing quickly, there was increased demand for municipal government. As a result, Mount Pearl held its first election in 1955 which resulted in Hayward Burrage becoming the first mayor of the Town of Mount Pearl. The town was incorporated on January 11, 1955 and had population of 1,979. On July 21, 1988, the Town of Mount Pearl became the third community in Newfoundland and Labrador to be granted city status. Today, it remains one of the largest cities within the province, with a population in 2016 of 23,120. Geography Mount Pearl is located on the northeast coast of the Avalon Peninsula in southeast Newfoundland, and on the Atlantic Ocean. The city is bounded on the north, south and east by the city of St. John's and on the west by the town of Paradise, which has led to the limited availability of undeveloped land and is causing the city to be a more dense urban centre by increasing its density. Southlands, a neighbourhood in St. John's was a large part of Mount Pearl's future growth plans for filling in the area between its boundary and Cochrane Pond Provincial Park. In 1998, the Provincial Government granted the land to the City of St. John's.\\"Land, ahoy: Wells urges province to amalgamate cities\\". CBC News, Jan 09, 2007 Climate Mount Pearl has a humid continental climate (Dfb) with short, mild summers and long, cold winters. Demographics The city is located within Newfoundland's census Division 1. In 2016, Mount Pearl was 92.7% White, 5.6% Aboriginal, and 1.7% other. The median age was 44.5 in 2016 and 41.6 in 2011. The median income was $78,232 before taxes in 2016, with a median income of $67,055 after taxes in 2016. Government=Municipal The city is represented by a mayor, deputy mayor and five councillors. Elections in Mount Pearl are held every four years on the last Tuesday in September, the last election was held on September 26, 2017. The current mayor is Dave Aker. He became mayor after then-Mayor Randy Simms decided not to seek re-election, and after defeating opponent Travis Faulkner, Aker was elected as mayor.

They are one of the earliest settlers of the island country. They were relocated due to erosion on their island to other parts of the Kaafu Atoll, including the Hulhul√© Island and the capital city of Mal√©.  Etymology  The name Giraavaru is thought to be derived from the words Gira meaning eroding and varu meaning people or islanders. Origins The Giraavaru origins are descendant of people from Malabar Coast of India and northwestern shores of Sri Lanka, who probably settled on the island around the Sangam period (300BC-300AD)Xavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom They are mentioned in the legend about the establishment of the capital and kingly rule in Mal√©, where the Giraavaru people granted permission to a visiting king Koimala Kalo prior to the foundation of his kingdom on Mal√©.They heavily mixed with Indo Aryan speakers to create Modern Dhivehi people's. Although the Giraavaru was much larger and civilized at the time, most of the island has eroded due to changing weather. Until the twentieth century the Giraavaru people displayed recognisable physical, linguistic and cultural differences to the nearby islands. Their culture and language were of clear Tamil-Malayalam extraction. They were strictly monogamous and prohibited divorce. Their folklore was preserved in song and dance. Their music was audibly different from that of the other islanders. The most distinct items were the necklaces of tiny blue beads which no other Maldivian wore. It is said that the Giraavaru people were always headed by a woman and that throughout Maldivian history, a woman (foolhuma-dhaitha), represented the Sultan's civil authority in Giravaru Island. The Sultans of the Maldives used to recognise the autonomy of the Giraavaru people and did not apply quite the same laws on them as they did on the rest of their realm. The Giravaru people never seemed to fully recognise the sovereignty of the Sultans. Ordinary Maldivians were required to address the Mal√© nobility in a different level of speech. However, the Giravaru people did not observe this custom and addressed the Mal√© nobility as they would usually address themselves. It was believed that the Giravaru people were mortally scared of toads. Things changed since 1932 when a written constitution was adopted. The customary rights of the indigenous Giraavaru people were not recognised in that document. Any rights they seemed to have enjoyed under the absolute rule of the Sultans were extinguished by default. End of the culture In 1968, due to heavy erosion of the island and as a result, reduction of the community to a few members, they were forced to abandon their island under an Islamic regulation that did not recognise communities with less than 40 adult males, which was the minimum required for the regular performance of Friday prayers. The Giraavaru people were ferried across the atoll lagoon to Hulhul√© Island and resettled there. When the airport there was extended they were shifted across to Mal√© and housed in a few blocks in newly reclaimed areas in the Maafanu district. The distinct Giraavaru culture swiftly disappeared when the Giraavaru young people were assimilated into the wider Mal√© society through intermarriage. \\"Pure\\" Giraavaru are now thought to be extinct. The Giraavarus were isolated and thus an endogamous society with a relatively low population for more than a millennium. As a result, the population showed a number of heritable genetic disorders when they were forcibly assimilated with a larger population in the forties.

At least 90% of the efforts of an ANBI has to be focused on the general good. And since 2012 the 'culturele ANBI' can profit (until at least 2018) from even more Dutch tax advantages. Conditions The ANBI does not have to be a Dutch legal personality. But often the ANBI is a Dutch foundation ('stichting'), though not every foundation qualifies. It can also be a Dutch vereniging (voluntary association). It cannot be an organisation that is for the benefit of its members or shareholders only: a sport club, association of personnel, or a commercial institution. The ANBI does not have to have registered offices in the Netherlands nor in the EU. The most important conditions are: *The ANBI can not be a company with capital divided into shares, a cooperative, a mutual insurance society or another body that may issue participation certificates. *At least 90% of the ANBIs efforts must be focused on the general good. The ANBI and the persons directly involved in the ANBI must comply with the integrity requirements. *An ANBI director or person determining the policy may not treat the ANBI's assets as personal assets. The assets must be segregated. *An ANBI may not retain more assets than reasonably required for the institutions work. For this reason the ANBI's assets must remain limited. *The ANBI directors‚Äô remuneration must be restricted to an expense allowance or a minimum attendance fee. *An ANBI must possess an up-to-date policy plan. *The ANBI's costs must be in reasonable proportion to its expenditure. *The ANBI funds remaining after dissolution must be allocated to a general good objective identical to the ANBI's objective. *An ANBI is governed by specific administrative obligation. More conditions apply to ANBIs as of January 1, 2014. The Dutch Tax Administration can revoke an ANBI designation anytime. Special regulations apply in that case. The database of registered ANBIs is online and searchable. Institutions without an office inside the Netherlands can start the application for designation as ANBI or Culturele ANBI by submitting a written request for an application form (in Dutch) to the Belastingdienst/Oost-Brabant in Eindhoven (formerly in 's-Hertogenbosch).

They speak Khowar, which is a member of the Dardic subgroup of the Indo-Aryan language family. Many Kho people live in the Chitral, Ghizer and Gilgit-Baltistan districts of Pakistan. History The Kho people are likely descendants of those who migrated to their present location in Chitral from the south. In ancient times the Kho people followed a culture that is described to be of the Peristani-type, and practiced a faith akin to that observed by the Kalash today. During the Hindu Shahi rule over Chitral an ancient Sanskrit inscription near Barenis mentions that the inhabitants of Chitral were Buddhists. After the arrival of Muslim rule in India, many of the Kho converted to Islam though some previous customs continue to persist. With respect to Islam, the Kho are primarily Sunni Muslims although there exists a substantial population of Ismaili Muslims in the North. Demographics Historically the Kho people reside in the Dardistan region. As such, they are a Dardic ethnic group located primarily in South Asia. Many of the Kho people live in the Chitral District of the Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and a smaller number also live in Ghizer District of Gilgit Baltistan (including the Yasin Valley, Phandar Ishkoman and Gupis). They are also found in few numbers in northern Afghanistan, where the majority of them live in the northern provinces of Badakhshan. Culture Kho culture places heavy emphasis on poetry, song and dance. Kho people also have a great respect of law and order. Much of this can be attributed to Chitral being a stable kingdom for most of its history, where the rule of law and the will of the ruler came before tribal concepts such as revenge and isolationism. Many Kho believe that their customs and language is much more rich, polite, and sophisticated in comparison to their neighbours. Polo is a popular sport and pastime for the Kho people. The polo traditionally played by the Kho has little rules or organisation. Dance and music play a large role in Kho society. Common clothing include the salwar kameez (long tunic and trousers) and headwear includes the pakol (chitrali hat). Because of Chitral's location at the crossroads of Central Asia and South Asia, the Kho display a wide variety of cultures, largely depending upon their ancestral ethnic group and family history. Languages The Kho people speak the Khowar language, a member of the Dardic subgroup of the Indo-Aryan language family. The ethnologists Karl Jettmar and Lennart Edelberg noted, with respect to the Khowar language, that: \\"Khowar, in many respects [is] the most archaic of all modern Indian languages, retaining a great part of Sanskrit case inflexion, and retaining many words in a nearly Sanskritic form.‚Äù Khowar is spoken by about 247,000 Kho people in northern Pakistan, Some of the Kho people use Urdu as a second language.  Genetics  According to Aziz et al. 2019, the western Eurasian mtDNA haplogroups were observed predominantly and mostly shared in Kho samples with overall frequency of 50%. These include HV8, H19, H57, H24, C and, C4a haplogroups. The South Asian haplogroups and its relevant subgroups including U4, U4c, U6, U5a, and W were also found in Kho samples with overall 37.5% frequency. Another South Asian haplogroup, M30 was also identified for Kho samples with frequency of 6.2%. The haplogroups and haplotypes specify the origin and linkages of an individual and population. The mtDNA haplogroup analysis eventually demonstrates the western Eurasian ancestral origin of Kho samples. However, the presence of few South Asian haplogroups with a minor proportion revealed that Kho might be an admixed population of south and western Asian genetic components. This indicates the genetic affiliation of Kho with the South Asian populations. Folk music Folk singers and reed instrument players have a special respect in the Kho society and are featured in their festivities. The most common instruments are Surnai Shehnai, Sitar, and reed instruments. The Kho sitar is a popular musical instrument in Chitral. It is made out of mulberry wood with five steel strings arranged in three courses, the outer ones have double strings, tuned in unison, while the inner course is single. Popular music of the area includes: * Shishtoo-war (Sauz), a popular folk music played with shehnai on happy occasions, mostly at marriages. * Shab-daraaz (Dani) is a sad tone based on heartbroken love poems. * Ghalhwar is a combination of Dani and Sauz. This is a mixture of fast and classical music played at the starting of a polo match.

He was a client of Pompey and like Pompey he came from Picenum a region in eastern Italy. He cornered and killed the notorious rebel Catiline at Pistoia. Career The chronology of the early stages of Petreius‚Äô career is unclear.Marcus Petreius' father may have been the Centurion Gnaeus Petreius Atinas, who in 102 BC saved a Legion from destruction by the Cimbri and thereby received the Grass Crown (Pliny, naturalis historia 22, 11). He was in any case the first in his family line to enter into the Senate. Sallust describes him as a military man, who in 62 BC already had a thirty-year-long career in the army as Military tribune, Prefect and Legate behind him.Sallust, Bellum Catilinae 59, 6: Homo militaris, quod amplius annos triginta tribunus aut praefectus aut legatus aut praetor cum magna gloria in exercitu fuerat. Petreius served at the latest in 64 BC as Praetor, although the exact year he took on this position is unknown. Petreius first served under Pompeius Strabo during the Social War (91-88 BC). In 76-71 BC he served Pompey as a Legate in Spain fighting Sertorius. In 63/62 BC he served as Legate under the Consul Gaius Antonius Hybrida. He led the Senatorial forces in the victory over the revolutionary Lucius Sergius Catilina at Pistoria in early 62 BC, while Hybrida remained away from the battle with a foot ache.Sallust, Bellum Catilinae 59, 4‚Äì61. During Gaius Julius Caesar‚Äôs Consulship of 59 BC, Marcus Petreius allied himself with Caesar‚Äôs bitter opponent Marcus Porcius Cato (the Younger).Cassius Dio 38, 3, 2. From 55 BC, Petreius and Lucius Afranius administered the Spanish provinces as Legates, while the official governor Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus remained in Rome.Velleius Paterculus 2, 48, 1. After the outbreak of the Civil War in 49 BC, Petreius and Afranius marched against Caesar, who for his part wished to secure Spain before moving against Pompey in Greece.Caesar, de bello civili 1, 38‚Äì87. The two Legates suffered defeat after initial successes, and were forced to capitulate and disband their army on August 2 at Ilerda. Caesar allowed Petreius and Afranius their freedom, and the two travelled to Greece to join Pompey‚Äôs forces. After Pompey‚Äôs defeat in the Battle of Pharsalus, Petreius and Cato fled from the Peloponnese to North Africa, where the former continued to serve as Legate in the resistance to Caesar.Cassius Dio 43, 13, 3. Together with Titus Labienus, Petreius again achieved several successes against Caesar.Appian, Civil Wars 2,95. After the defeat of the Pompeians at Thapsus, Petreius fled with the Numidian King, Juba.Pseudo Caesar, de bello Africo 91, 1.

A comic adaptation of the book was included in the graphic novel compilation Terror Trips, part of the Goosebumps Graphix series. There were two video games based on the book. The HorrorLand theme park was expanded upon in the book series Goosebumps HorrorLand. Plot The Morris family and their friend Clay become lost, accidentally finding the HorrorLand theme park. Shortly after parking, their car explodes, but the ticket-taker reassures them that it will be taken care of. The children, Lizzy, Luke and Clay, explore the theme park and get on the rides. After a ride in which Lizzy is locked in a casket traveling down a river, the three of them attempt to convince the parents, Carl and Peggy, that they all should leave. The two reveal that they experienced similar problems, so they all decide to confront the Horrors. After the Morris family and Clay discover that the gates have been locked to prevent their escape, the monsters surround them. In anger, Lizzy tries to remove a mask from one of the monsters, which she discovers is actually the Horror's face. The Horrors explain that they are monsters, but that the visitors' experiences were part of a television show. As an apology, the monsters say that they will lead them towards a new car, but they are led to carnivorous animals. After the family survives the animals' attack, the monsters attempt to murder them. Lizzy then remembers signs within the park that said \\"No pinching\\". The visitors proceed to pinch all of the monsters, resulting in them deflating like balloons. The Morris family and Clay escape HorrorLand in a different car, but in a twist ending, find out that a Horror held onto the back of the vehicle until they reached their home. The monster offers them free passes for their next visit. Publications The book was a USA Today bestseller in March 1994. It was released again in 2011, under the Classic Goosebumps rename. Kevin Pires from FlavorWire listed the book as one of his ten favorite Goosebumps books, and Nathan Reese from Complex.com rated One Day at HorrorLand his ninth favorite book from the series. Reese also thought the ending was more dark and humorous than most other books. Return to HorrorLand, a sequel to the book and the thirteenth book of the series Goosebumps Series 2000, was released in 1999. Lizzy, Luke, and Clay revisit HorrorLand, so that they can attempt to close the theme park. Adaptations A video game titled Goosebumps: Escape from HorrorLand was released in 1996, by DreamWorks, for Microsoft Windows. Players have to encounter film monsters such as Dracula (played by Jeff Goldblum). In a 2008 video game titled Goosebumps HorrorLand, released for the Wii, Nintendo DS and PlayStation 2, the players attempt to escape from the theme park. The book was also adapted into a board game titled Goosebumps One Day at HorrorLand Game, which was released by Milton Bradley Company. Terror Trips, the second volume of the graphic novel trilogy Goosebumps Graphix, includes an adaptation that was illustrated by Jill Thompson. R. J. Carter, of The Trades, wrote that some panels of the comic were influenced by manga.

(Courtesy of A.H. Stanton.) Henry Collen (9 October 1797, Middlesex ‚Äì 8 May 1879, Brighton) was an English miniature portrait painter to Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and the Duchess of Kent. Later in life he turned to photography and was the first professional calotypist in London.  Portrait painter  Henry Collen was born on 9 October 1797 and baptised at St. Pancras, Middlesex. When he was 29, he married Ellen Dison, who was born in 1805 and had spent her childhood in Ireland. They were married on 12 August 1826 in Maghera in County Londonderry in Ireland. Henry Collen learned to paint at the Royal Academy and, from 1819, under the tutelage of Sir George Hayter whose family had been, and remained close personal friends of the Collen family. In fact, in her letters, Ellen states that she met Henry at the home of John Hayter, Sir George's younger brother, also a prolific painter. Henry Collen was the godfather of Sir George Hayter's third son Angelo Collen Hayter (1819‚Äì1898) who was an amateur painter and Sir George Hayter was the godfather of Henry's son Edwin (1843‚Äì1911), who was baptised Edwin Henry Hayter Collen. > In the eighteen-thirties, Henry Collen was personally acquainted with young > Princess Victoria, being her drawing teacher and her miniature portrait > painter ... For her fourteenth birthday on 24 May 1833 Victoria received a > 'little painting for my album' from Collen, and on at least two occasions > she sat for her portrait by him. Princess Victoria, painted by Henry Collen in 1836 when she was 17, the year before she became Queen. Henry Collen made a fairly moderate living as a portrait painter in London in the mid-19th century. Between 1820 and 1872 he exhibited at least one hundred paintings at the Royal Academy and the SBA, and by 1821 he had won a silver medal at the Royal Academy. One of the four Henry Collen portraits was of a John Avery titled \\"Surgeon\\", which is a watercolour miniature on ivory, being only 8\\" √ó 5\\". This piece is on display at Bodelwyddan Castle, as are two other works, an oil painting on panel of Robert Vernon by George Jones and Henry Collen, painted in 1848 and a portrait of Henry Bickersteth, Baron Langdale, painted in 1829, entitled Master of the Roles. This piece is also a watercolour miniature on ivory and only 4\\" √ó 3. There are two pictures of Charles Mayne Young. One is another watercolour on ivory, painted in 1824. The other is a mezzotint published in 1826 but is not on display. Another piece that is not on display is a stipple engraving of Jane Elizabeth, Countess of Ellenborough, published in 1829. So, in all, six portraits that hang in the NPG are \\"associated\\" with Henry Collen. The Victoria and Albert Museum has a regular miniature of a man, which is 4 in. √ó 3in., signed H. Collen/1846, the H and C being separate. The National Portrait Gallery has a miniature of Baron Langdale by Collen, 1829. The Wallace Collection has a miniature of Sarah the Countess of Warwick by Collen, 1825, after Hayter. At Windsor Castle are several miniatures by Collen, including portraits of the Duchess of Kent (1829) and Lady Catherine Vernon Harcourt (1838). One of them is a copy after Hayter. The Duke of Northumberland has a miniature of Lady Margaret Percy by Collen. According to G. Scharf's Third Portion of a Catalogue of Pictures.... Duke of Bedford, 1878, p. 109: > The Duke of Bedford has an oval miniature of a lady, about 35/8 in. √ó 27/8 > in., signed in front with a scratched signature \\"H Collen 1840\\" (the H and C > not forming a monogram) and inscribed at the back \\"1840/painted by Henry > Collen/Miniature Painter to/ The Queen and H.R.H. the Duchess of Kent/29 > Somerset St /Portman Square/London.\\" It is broader in treatment than many of > his earlier works. The British Museum has some engraved portraits by Collen. Henry Collen worked in the company of many respected artists in mid-19th century London, as well as important scientists of his day. He collaborated in the early 1840s with the famous astronomer, John Frederick William Herschel. He may have associated with the artist Thomas Sully and his wife. Besides being close to the Hayter family, who were already established artists, Henry and Ellen were also close friends of Edwin Landseer, the well-known painter of animals and pastoral English landscapes as well as the designer of the four bronze lions at the base of Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square, London. Landseer was the godfather of Henry's only son, Edwin. In the book of printed correspondence between Ellen and Edwin Collen, titled Letters from my Mother, Ellen mentioned that Landseer sent a note and a gift at Edwin's baptism. She also mentions going to the funeral of Charles Landseer.  Portrait photographer  By the 1840s, Henry Collen was established as a portrait painter of some note. It is also at this time that his photographic work became known. In March 1840 Collen became interested in experimenting with electrotyping daguerreotype plates for printing purposes. By spring he was experimenting extensively with the calotype processes, the lenses, the paper, etc. (Schaaf) Calotype was an early photographic process developed by Henry Fox Talbot who was a colleague of Collen's. Talbot supplied the photographic knowledge and Collen the artistic know-how. In an article titled \\"Photography in the 1840s,\\" Peter Marshall describes the distinction between daguerreotypes and calotypes. \\"The daguerrotype spread rapidly around the world...There were some limitations on the spread.\\" Daguerre's process was somewhat limited by his prior patent in the UK, and so only those professionals who could afford a license were able to do so. Meanwhile, Talbot patented his calotype process in the UK and the US, but he was unable to get a patent in France which also limited its growth. Also, Marshall states, \\"In general, most professional photographers used the daguerreotype process in the 1840s, while the calotype was generally favored by those who were not attempting to earn an income.\\" (A chart describing the differences between calotypes and daguerreotypes is included in the Appendix). In August 1841, Fox Talbot licensed Henry Collen as the first professional photographer or calotypist. Queen Victoria With Daughter, taken by Henry Collen in 1844 He then set himself up as a calotype portraitist in August 1841, in what was probably the first calotype portrait studio, at 29 Somerset Street, Portman Square, London (between Oxford Street and Manchester Square) near the present sight of Selfridge's. \\"Licenses were expensive. Talbot took 30 percent of Collen's takings for his use of the process\\" (Marshall). Henry received favourable responses from his colleagues about the quality of his portraits. He took approximately one thousand portraits using the calotype process. \\"Collen's photographic miniatures were a compromise between the old art of miniature painting and the new art of photography ‚Äì they were overpainted paper photographs. The earliest extant photograph of Queen Victoria was almost certainly taken by Collen in 1844 or 1845.\\" (Bill Jay) Robert A. Sobieszek had this to say about photography and Henry Collen in Victorian England: > During the Victorian period, 'artistical' photographs were customarily > judged on four points: First, that they were exact replicas of Nature's form > and appearance. Second, they were to communicate the \\"feeling, sentiment, or > sensations of Nature\\" and be able to cause similar emotional reactions. > Third, and more vague, the artistic photograph was to record the romantic > expressions and impressions of this same Nature. And, fourth, the final > photograph was to be formally and spiritually perfect, reflecting Nature's > perfections. The landscapes of Roger Fenton and Francis Frith, and the > portraiture of Antoine Claudet and Henry Collen . . . are clear and certain > applications of the above prescriptions to photographic picture-making. > (Sobieszek) The distinguishing feature of Henry Collen's photographic portraits was the fact that as an artist, he could touch up his portraits with paint. When he enhanced with paint, he was able to charge a bit more for them. Unfortunately, as time has passed, the silver of the photographs has faded, but the paint has not, so the portraits have an uneven, exaggerated, faded and sometimes splotchy look. It is thought that this is one reason why Collen's work in photography has not been recognised as it may have been if the portraits had remained intact.  Scientific photography  In the 1844-46 period, Collen interacted with inventor Francis Ronalds, Honorary Director of the Kew Observatory. Ronalds was developing machines to make continuous recordings of the variations of meteorological parameters using photography. Collen in fact published the first paper written on the instruments. Ronalds put on record that \\"Collen claims a share in my inventions unjustly\\"; his view was that Collen‚Äôs advice to him had concerned only photographic processing techniques. Ronalds went on to build and describe various different photo-recording machines in a series of reports and papers, which were employed in observatories around the world until well into the 20th century.  Photocopier  In the late 1970s, Larry Schaaf wrote about the contributions of Henry Collen to the field of photography in its early stages in London in the 19th century. Schaaf's premise was that Collen's work was indeed noteworthy, and had perhaps been overshadowed by the earlier work of William Henry Fox Talbot in the same field. The information on the following pages comes from Mr. Schaaf's article titled, \\"Henry Collen and the Treaty of Nanking,\\" which appeared in The History of Photography, an international quarterly, October 1982. The Treaty of Nanking was signed on 29 August 1842. The treaty signalled the end of the \\"Opium Wars\\" between China and England. It also ceded the island of Hong Kong to England and was of great commercial and psychological importance to the British Empire. Photography was in its infancy. Daguerre's method had the \\"ability to record the fine detail\\" but would have supplied \\"only a small metal plate as a facsimile of the rice paper.\\" Talbot's process was far more suitable for copying the original treaty, and so authorities turned to the first man licensed to practice in London\\" and the man who had the know-how to make the photographic copy of the treaty.(Schaaf) Schaaf states, \\"Henry Collen was in the unique position of both owning the patent rights and of having access to the circles of power. As miniature-painter to the Queen, he would have been in a position to discuss such a project with the proper people...\\" Treaty of Nanking and Camera On Christmas Day, Collen produced at least two photographic copies of the original document handwritten in ink. \\"Copying a four-foot -long document with delicate lettering out to the edges would be quite difficult, especially in 1842\\" (Schaaf). He goes on to state that he thinks Collen merits a great deal more study than he had been given to that date. Since Larry Schaaf wrote his 1982 article about the Treaty of Nanking, R. Derek Wood has written another article titled \\"Photocopying the Treaty of Nanking in January 1843.\\" In it, Wood includes new information about the number of copies produced by Henry Collen and their whereabouts. It seems that the original treaty was brought to London for the Queen's signature after Collen made the copy. At the last minute, it was decided that an extra copy should be made to hang at Buckingham Palace, which is why Collen was working on it on Christmas Day. Wood believes that three copies were made in all. The copy that hung at the palace is thought to have been discarded but there is a copy at the International Museum of Photography and Film at the George Eastman House in Rochester, NY. It is in book form, 22 and 16 pages in English and Chinese, respectively, and is bound in leather. (see photo) Mr. Wood's article deciphers the long journey of this copy and the location of the original Chinese document. Collen's copies were taken to China, but by 1877 the original could not be located. It seems that when in the very last few days of June in 1997, as Hong Kong was passed back to the People's Republic of China, a(n)....announcement was made to reveal that Chiang Kai-shek's Chinese Nationalist forces had secretly taken the original Treaty of Nanking when they retreated to Taiwan from China in 1949. And the documents have been hidden in a sealed vault of the Taiwan Foreign Ministry. (Wood) Meanwhile, in 1952, the George Eastman House was offered for purchase one of Henry Collen's copies from a dealer of rare books in California. It was unknown how this dealer had obtained this copy. Wood's article also includes copies of bills for production costs and copies of the treaty (included in Appendix). At any rate, even after such seemingly important strides in the infant field of photography, Henry Collen still had unsurmountable hurdles to face in his attempts to make photography a financially viable profession. The problem, in part, was due to the nature of his relationship to Talbot. The relationship between Henry Collen and Henry Talbot seems quite complex. They were probably good friends. Talbot originated the calotype process and licensed Collen to practice it. Henry paid Talbot a fair share of his profits. Collen worked to perfect the process and invested considerable time and energy into this work. He wanted patent protection rights from Talbot because of this. Talbot stalled in this area. As mentioned earlier, Talbot had the scientific knowledge and Collen the artistic, but for some reason, Talbot did not pursue the business possibilities attendant to the caloytype process. When Collen was asked to photograph the Treaty of Nanking, Talbot's wife later lamented about why Talbot himself hadn't done the job \\"for her Majesty.\\" (Schaaf). Schaaf also states that Talbot for some reason did not share all of his expertise with Collen, and at some point Henry's lack of scientific know-how limited his ability to experiment further. Henry Collen had taken over one thousand calotype portraits but had received payment for only 265 of them. It was not profitable for Collen or Talbot to continue. He ended his calotype business in 1844 and retired to St. Albans in 1861. He had photographed some of the most important people of his day and his photographic work was respected enough to hang in Buckingham Palace. The largest collections of his photographic works are in the George Eastman House in Rochester, N.Y. and The Science Museum in London as well as the Fox Talbot Museum and the Royal Photographic Society. In spite of an unfortunately shortened photographic career, Henry Collen is mentioned and published in various journals of photography and science (see appendix).

It is now considered lost.The Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog: That Royle Girl Production A poor young woman (Carol Dempster) from the slums of Chicago singlehandedly saves a jazz bandleader (Harrison Ford) after he is improperly convicted and sentenced to death for murder. This film, along with Sally of the Sawdust, marked Griffith's return to working for an important Hollywood studio, (Paramount), something he hadn't experienced since leaving Biograph in 1914 though his independently produced features were released through Triangle, Paramount and United Artists. He also had to work with a tight shooting script as Paramount executives Adolph Zukor and Jesse L. Lasky insisted the film be brought on schedule and on budget. Griffith had been a founding partner in Triangle Studios in 1915 and United Artists in 1919, and these ventures allowed him leeway in the way he made films. However, now the leisurely approach to filmmaking Griffith had enjoyed at his own Mamaroneck, New York Long Island studio was gone. Griffith had been for all intents and purposes an independent producer since leaving Biograph. Griffith shot That Royle Girl on locations across Chicago. The film's climactic sequence, a devastating tornado, was filmed on a football field at Paramount's Astoria Studio in Queens, New York, where Griffith created a fully built village. Griffith used the power of 24 airplane propellers to recreate the wreckage and ruin of the tornado's fury. While the production was underway, Griffith added W. C.

Biography=Early years Afford was born in Adelaide, South Australia, the youngest son of Robert D. Afford of \\"Glenleigh\\", Stamford street Parkside, an inner suburb. He left school when he was 16, and started writing novels and plays. Adult life After winning the centenary competition in Adelaide, he moved to Sydney in 1936, on contract to the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) as a playwright and producer in the Federal Productions Department. Max married Thelma Thomas on 16 April 1938 at St Michael's church, Vaucluse, Sydney. Thelma, a costume designer whom he met on the set of Colonel Founder / Awake my Love two years earlier, was originally from Broken Hill,Caption to photograph of Thelma Thomas (Adelaide) Advertiser 29 October 1937 p.11 then Adelaide, and had moved to Sydney to design the costumes for the New South Wales sesqui-centenary pageant. Max and Thelma did not have children. Death Afford died of cancer on 2 November 1954 at Mosman, Sydney, and was cremated. Thelma Afford survived him until 1996. Numerous condolence letters from his friends, colleagues and admirers were sent to his wife from around Australia and from overseas including the US, the UK and Hong Kong. Many are held in the Fryer Library at the University of Queensland and express sadness about his death, admiration for his literary achievement and regret for the great loss to the Australian literary world. \\"Max was one of the sweetest, gayest and most endearing people I have ever encountered\\", Betty Roland wrote. Tom Inglis Moore said, \\"He was such an attractive person in himself, and he had outstanding gifts. As a writer he was at the top of the profession as a dramatic writer for radio, a first-class craftsman. His stage plays showed that if he had gone on, he would have become an important playwright. I felt that Max had the talent to have gone even further in achievement. He had such a vitality that it is very hard to realize the truth.\\" Then Chairman of ABC, Sir Richard Boyer, wrote,\\"Max was not only the most valued contributor to some of the best of our broadcasts, but was held in great respect and affection by all of us in the ABC (Australian Broadcasting Commission).\\" David Carver, the International Secretary and General Secretary of English PEN expressed gratitude for his contributions to Australian literary life: \\"The Sydney P.E.N. owed him a great deal for all the hard work and enthusiasm of his years as President.\\" Ernest William Burbridge, Representative of the British Council in Australia, wrote that \\"(Max) was so devoted to his art, and had such passionate belief in the cause of Drama.\\" Professional life=Beginnings in Adelaide Max Afford wrote three novels while in his twenties, which were later published in England and America. He worked as a reporter at the News and Mail from 1926 to 1931. His first story was published in Smith's Weekly in 1928. In 1936 he won the Advertiser's centenary play competition with William Light The Founder (later titled Awake My Love). His 'Jeffrey and Elizabeth Blackburn' novels included Blood on His Hands! (London, 1936) and Death's Mannikins (London, 1937). Many were dramatised for radio, variously starring Peter Finch and Neva Carr Glyn, Nigel Lovell and Lyndall Barbour or Peter Finch and Bettie Dickson as the husband-and-wife detective team. Afford wrote eight crime novels, usually employing English settings, and more than sixty radio and stage plays, usually stories of crime involving the sifting of situations that ultimately uncover the perpetrators. He was considered somewhat of a pioneer of the \\"whodunit\\" in radio broadcasting. A science fiction story, The Gland Men of the Island, appeared in Wonder Stories in January 1931. Afford as depicted in Wonder Stories in 1931 Career in Sydney Afford was one of the first contract writers to be engaged by the ABC. In 1936, he won three playwriting awards, and was appointed Staff Dramatist by the ABC, with whom he was contracted for six years. During this time he wrote 30 one-and-a-half-hour plays, 15 serials, more than 100 play adaptations, and produced a number of his own plays. From 1941 he wrote children's and adult radio serials including Hagen's Circus (800 episodes) for radio 2GB and 2UE. In 1942, Afford resigned from the ABC and joined the radio station 2GB, for whom he wrote two long-running commercial serials: First Light Fraser (400 episodes), and Digger Hale's Daughters (208 episodes). Other radio plays included Lazy in the Sun and Out of This Nettle, and the long-running 1951 A.B.C. serial, Stranger Come In, which explored the subject of immigration. In 1945, Afford created an all-time record in Australian theatrical history by having two three-act plays presented professionally by the J.C. Williamson theatre company at the Theatre Royal, Sydney. These two plays were Lady in Danger and Mischief in the Air, and were presented within two months of one another ‚Äì a significant feat, as prior to the production of Lady in Danger, Williamson had not presented a locally written play for 20 years. Afford's play Lady in Danger (1942), successfully produced at Sydney's Independent TheatreSydney Morning Herald 2 March 1942 by Doris Fitton, was then staged by J. C. Williamson Ltd and was staged in the US, adapted to American tastes by Jack Kirkland.Sydney Morning Herald 11 December 1943 The Broadway production received poor reviews and closed after 12 performances. He also wrote Mischief in the Air and co-wrote with Ken G. Hall the story for the Columbia Film Corporation's film, Smithy (1946), based on the aviator Sir Charles Kingsford Smith. Afford was president of the Sydney PEN Club in 1950. His play, Dark Enchantment, toured England's provincial theatres in 1950. In 1952, Afford signed a contract with the A.B.C. engaging his services as a radio writer for 26 weeks, during which time he was to write five 15-minute installments based on immigration, as a serial on 5 days of the week, twice per day if required. Recognition in Australia * Winner of The Advertiser's centenary play competition, organized to mark the 1936 Adelaide Centenary, for Colonel Light the Founder (later Awake My Love). * First prize in the ABC's All-Australian Play Competition, in 1936, for Merry Go-Round.\\"ABC Awards for Plays\\", (Brisbane) Courier-Mail 31 March 1936 p.13 * Equal first prize for libretto of Spruhan Kennedy's Pas de Six in the ABC's Operetta Contest, 1936. * The Biographical Encyclopedia of the World included Afford in their 1948 edition of Who's Important in Literature. * His portrait, by Brian Crozier, was (unsuccessfully) entered for the 1951 Archibald Prize. * At her death, Thelma Afford established a fund for a Max Afford Playwrights' Award. International recognition Afford's radio plays and serials have been re-broadcast in Canada, England, South Africa, New Zealand, Poland, and Egypt. His radio plays have been produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, as well as by BBC London, by Lux Radio Theatre in South Africa, by the National Broadcasting Service in New Zealand, and also in Cairo. The BBC, for example, bought his serial Fly By Night and his radio plays Labours of Hercules, Oh, Whistle When You're Happy, The Four Specialists and For Fear of Little Men.\\"Australian Radio Plays\\" Canberra Times 14 August 1939 p.2 Lady in Danger was the second play by an Australian dramatist ever to be performed at a Broadway theatre in front of an American audience. Consulting Room was broadcast in South Africa in 1954, in both English and Afrikaans, by the Lux Radio Theatre. It is a one-actor serious play about the love between the young couple who try to commit suicide. It Walks By Night was also broadcast in English and Afrikaans. In 1937, the Geneva Conference selected The Four Specialists for translation into Polish to be broadcast by Polskie Radio. Critical reception * Colonel Light the Founder / Awake My Love The South Australian Tourism Commission said of its presentation during the Adelaide Centenary, 1936: \\"This play was a great success... completely accurate historically.\\" The Bulletin called it \\"Dramatic dynamite.\\" Sydney Morning Herald labelled it \\"a significant milestone for Australian drama.\\" The Sun called it \\"An outstanding contribution to Australian literature.\\" * Consulting Room Lux Radio Theatre, in South Africa, wrote to Afford in 1954 expressing their pleasure at his play Consulting Room, and asked him for more of his radio plays. * Jeffrey Blackburn serials The Blackburn serials found such popularity in Australia that 2UE decided to experiment with the structure of radio serials. They changed the typical structure of half an hour once a week, to 12-minute episodes four nights per week, and found listeners preferred not having to wait a whole week for the next instalment. Posthumous publications * Negotiation In early 1960, Thelma Afford endeavoured to obtain a Commonwealth Literary Fund grant to support posthumous publication of a book of Max Afford's stage plays. Tom Inglis Moore, who was in charge of the negotiation of its guarantee, was from 1945 to 1971 a member of the Fund's advisory board. He championed the cause of hundreds of authors and numerous literary journals, and acted as an advocate for left-wing writers in the 1950s.Moore, Tom Inglis at The Australian Dictionary of Biography, Online edition Freddie Howe, head of HarperCollins,4\\\\. Nicholson, Joyce Thorpe and Daniel Wrixon Thorpe. A Life of Books: The Story of D.W. Thorpe Pty Ltd 1921‚Äì1987, p.134. Melbourne: Courtyard Press, 2000. proposed the CLF sponsor a collection of three plays and submitted it to Mr. W. R. Cumming, Secretary of the CLF, along with the manuscripts. The amount required for guarantee varies from about ¬£80 to ¬£100 for small works up to ¬£500 or more for very large works, while Thelma thought of a guarantee from ¬£200 to ¬£300. Howe was doubtful about publishing the plays since the amount of publishing and preadvertising costs had been far heavier than his expectation. Moore, however, considered it practical and beneficial as CLF had just approved a new scheme of helping publishers with literary, not commercial, books. Collins should not lose out for the publication. Thelma then gave a book of Afford's radio plays to Sam Ure Smith, an Australian arts publisher and promoter, just in case Freddie was disinclined to publish the stage plays. At this stage, Thelma insisted on both volumes (the stage plays and the radio plays produced on the ABC) be published. In May, Howe agreed to go ahead with a book of stage plays providing he can obtain the Commonwealth of Australia's sponsorship. With this promise, Thelma decided to drop the attempt to publish radio plays with Sam Ure Smith. In June, Collins brought forward this collection of stage plays with two purposes in mind: First, to present a prestige book as a memorial to the late Max Afford, who won outstanding success as both stage and radio dramatist; Second, to make the plays available in published form for the repertory theatres. Howe submitted the proposition to CLF. The proposition is \\"quite unacceptable\\", said Tom Inglis Moore, \\"Lowe's guarantee requested of ¬£1114 is far too high and cannot be entertained. The size of the edition is too large at 2,500 and the retail price too high at ¬£35.\\" He recommended altering the proposition either by omitting Dark Enchantment to cut down the volume and the costs and to give a better balance of light and serious plays, or by replacing the collection with a series of single volumes suitable for the repertory societies to perform. * Outcome An agreement was finally reached: a volume of only two 3 plays: Lady in Danger, Awake My Love and Consulting Room plus an Introduction from Leslie Rees and a Foreword from Sir Richard Boyer. Thelma as the owner of the copyright waived her royalties, which represented a reduction of ¬£437 on the publishing costs; and a less ambitious edition of only 1400.

A gablefront cottage is a smaller variant, consisting of either a single story or a story-and-a-half. They were typically used as working-class dwellings, most being rather simple in design. However, they may contain some ornamentation such as brackets around the doorways or roof line. Many gablefront houses contain front porches. History The gablefront house developed after 1825 and coincided with the popularity of the Greek Revival style, which placed emphasis on the gable-end of the house in the form of a pediment; often associated with Greek temples.Architectural Styles, City of Fort Wayne The gablefront house allows the narrow part of the house to face the street, usually on a rectangular lot. The gablefront house became a uniquely American folk house type. The gablefront house cropped up in styles ranging from Greek Revival, to Gothic Revival, to Queen Anne, to a simpler vernacular style home.West Central Neighborhood Association The gablefront house form remained popular into the early 20th century.America's Favorite Homes: Mail-order Catalogues as a Guide to Popular Early 20th-century Houses, 1990 Variants=Gabled ell One variation of the gablefront house is the gabled ell.

They are divided into three subgroups: Mal Paharia, Sauria Paharia and Kumarbhag Paharia. All three are listed as Scheduled Tribes in Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal. They speak Malto, related to the nearby Kurukh language. When the British first encountered them they were nomadic. They practiced jhum cultivation, as well as hunting and gathering, and would often also raid the plains of Bihar to the north or Bengal to the east, and would then retreat back into the forest. If there was a crop failure, death or other disaster, they would move to a new spot. Due to the remoteness of their territory they were never conquered by any of the many empires that claimed to rule the region. When the British induced Santals to cultivate the Rajmahal Hills, the Maltos fought back, but were eventually driven out. The three subgroups of the Malto tribe do not intermarry. The Mal Paharia look down on the Sauria Paharia for eating cows. The Mal Paharia and Kumarbhag Paharia subgroups combined have a population of 182,560, while the Sauria Paharia subgroup has a population of 51,634, making the total Malto population 234,194. Today they still practice jhum cultivation, called kurwa in their language, and collect minor forest produce. They are plagued by many problems, including high levels of poverty and extreme malnutrition. For this reason they are classified as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group. However some are now settled cultivators. They fish in summer, and many now work as daily wage labourers. A few have government jobs. Among the Sauria Paharia, their traditional marriage ceremony is known as bedi, that takes place in a house. Their society has no restrictions on premarital sexual relations, and children not born out of a marriage can still live with the mother. Another type of common marriage is marriage by capture. The Malto practice animism and revere a court of spirits known as Gosain. The main Malto god is Dharmer Gosain, a sun god, while their priests are known as demano. The men wear a small loincloth, known as bhagwan, while the women wear two garments: panchi, an upper garment, usually an unstitched cloth, and pardhan, a cloth around the waist.

New Temple) is a historic Jain temple in Old Delhi in India,Bharat ke Digambar Jain Tirth, Volume 1, Balbhadra Jain, 1974 in the Dharampura locality allocated to the Jain community by Aurangzeb. History Raja Harsukh Rai, imperial treasurer in the late Mughal period, constructed a large and ornate Jain temple in the Dharampura locality of Old Delhi in 1807 during the rule of Mughal Emperor Akbar II with a cost of about 8 Lakh rupees, then an enormous amount.Jyotiprasad Jain, Pramukh Jain Etihasik Purush aur mahilayen, Bharatiya Jnanapitha, 1975 He was able to obtain the royal permission to construct a shikhara for the temple for the first time during the Mughal rule. Thus temple is known as the Naya Mandir (new temple), since an older Jain temple, now known as the Lal Mandir already existed. When the temple construction was almost finished, Harsukh Rai stopped the construction. When the representatives of the Agrawal Jain community approached him and asked about it, he claimed that he has run out of money and needed donations from the community to finish the construction. After accepting modest donations, Harsukh Rai declared the temple to be panchayati (i.e. belonging to the community, rather than himself) and finished the construction. During the festivities of temple consecration (Panch-kalyanak Pratishtha), the festive pandal was raided by a local group and the gold and silver objects (chhatra, chamar, utensils) were plundered. Harsukh Rai complained to the Emperor, who ordered that they be returned.Jain Jagran ke Agradut, A.P> Goyaliya, 1952 The temple houses an important collection of manuscripts. The Naya Mandir Maha- purana manuscript The Naya Mandir book collection includes a rare illustrated manuscript of Maha-purana of Acharya Jinasena.

Accounts of Nineteenth-century visitors After the 1857 Ghadar and during the early 20th century, this was the temple referred to as the Jain temple of Delhi by several European visitors. E. Augusta King in 1884 describes the temple as:The Diary of a Civilian's Wife in India, 1877-1882, By E. Augusta King, Robert Moss King Published by R. Bentley, 1884 :The frontage: The Jain temple has a fine frontage of carved stone, carved so profusely in such delicate airy tracery that it is difficult to believe it is stone. We went up a flight of steps and came to a courtyard surrounded by what we call Moorish arches, with colonnades having groined roofs, every inch of which was painted elaborately with graceful arabesques, the effect being rich and soft in the extreme. :The decorations: On one side of the courtyard is the temple proper, on a raised dais four feet high. The building and decorations are exquisite; the shafts of all the arches are of polished white marble inlaid with flowing flowery patterns in coloured marbles. The walls and ceiling and every available inch are painted richly, the prevailing colours being blue and gold, but all so artistically blended that the eye only takes in the general effect, which is something like that of a Cashmere shawl. :The central shrine: In the centre, under the dome, is a very beautiful shrine for the idol, who is sitting serenely at a height of ten feet or so under a fine baldachino of white inlaid marble. If the whole could be transported to Italy, and a statue of the Virgin substituted for the idol, its beauty would be raved about. A sparrow was perched familiarly on the shrine, and gave us some little friendly chirps to show he did not object to our presence. Some visitors describe the shrine as a \\"large wedding-cake\\".Our Visit to Hindost√°n, Kashmir, and Ladakh, By Harriet Georgiana Maria Manners-Sutton Murray-Aynsley, Published by Allen, 1879 James Fergusson, in his famous \\"History of Indian and Eastern Architecture\\" (1876) History of Indian and Eastern Architecture, By James Fergusson Edition: 2, Published by J. Murray, 1876 describes the temple as: : \\"There is one other example that certainly deserves notice before leaving this branch of the subject, not only on account of its beauty, but its singularity. .. It was left, however, for a Jaina architect of the end of the last or beginning of this century, in the Mahomodan city of Delhi, to suggest a mode by which what was only conventionally beautiful might really become an appropriate constructive part of lithic architecture. .. As will be observed in the last cut (No. 146), the architect has had the happy idea of filling in the whole of the back of the strut with pierced foliaged tracery of the most exquisite device..\\" Concealed chamber At one time many Jain temples contained a concealed chamber (sometimes called bhonyra ‡§≠‡•ã‡§Ç‡§Ø‡§∞‡§æ ‡§ó‡•ã‡§™‡§æ‡§ö‡§≤ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§®‡§ø‡§ï‡§ü‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡•Ä ‡§§‡•Ä‡§∞‡•ç‡§• ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•á‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ http://hindi.webdunia.com/religion/religion/jainism/0708/11/1070811065_2.htm)to preserve statues during troubled times to hide them. Naya Mandir also has a concealed chamber. A visitor in 1876 described it:A RUN THROUGH KATHIAWAR‚ÄîTHE HOLY MOUNTAIN, Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine Published by W. Blackwood, 1876, Item notes: v.120 1876 Jul-Dec : In Delhi I found a Jain temple which was wholly unknown to Europeans well acquainted with the city; and on prosecuting inquiry, I got its priest to open to me a concealed chamber containing large statues of several of the Tirthankaras richly ornamented. The chamber has now been given the form of a cave, suitable for peaceful meditation by visiting Jain monks.

Only 12 of the 19 islands are inhabited. The largest and main island is Great Nicobar. The term Nicobarese refers to the dominant tribes of the Nicobar Islands. On each island, the people have specific names, but together they are the Nicobarese. They call themselves Holchu, which means \\"friend\\". The Nicobarese are a designated Scheduled Tribe in India.  History  The Nicobarese may not have been the first people to live in the islands, they appear to have shared the islands with Shompen who came to the islands earlier. The islands have been under the power of various Asian empires in the 16th century, Denmark from 1754‚Äì1869, Great Britain from 1869‚Äì1947, and India from 1947. Today they are administered by India as part of the Union Territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  Language  The Nicobarese language is part of the Austroasiatic language family. All of the different islands speak different dialects of the Nicobarese language. The separate islands are categorized into four groups, although most of the people understand the Car Nicobar dialect.  Religion  Most of the people of the islands are of the Christian religion, which was taught to them by a man named John Richardson who translated the New Testament into Nicobarese. Besides Christianity, other Nicobarese follow the traditional religion of the islands, which is animistic in nature. They believe in spirits, ghosts, and the existence of the soul. A person becomes a ghost after their death when their soul leaves their body and the ghosts of all the Nicobarese are all around the islands. They believe that the spirits are responsible for all of the unfortunate occurrences on the islands, in the event of which shamans are called upon to handle the bad spirits. Art Their painted sculptures are related to the oral tradition and the myth of Nicobarese origins. In their conception of the world, they inhabit the kingdoms of the sea, the earth and the sky, which they cross through the magic-religious sphere. These anthropomorphic creations are the spirits of living beings, natural elements, even everyday objects. They live with human beings or visit them from another world. In the houses, the spirits of the ancestors of the family inhabit the sculptures and are thus an integral part of the domestic environment: the inhabitants of today live in harmony with those of the other worlds, represented by the images. Society A traditional Nicobar hut The Nicobarese are headed by a chief called \\"Rani\\" or \\"queen\\". The first Rani of the Nicobarese was Islon who married Mewalal, tahsildar of Nancowry in 1941-42, and became the most influential person in the Nicobar Islands. On the Nicobar Islands, men and women have approximate equal status. The women have a lot to do with their own choice of husbands, and after marriage they are free to live with either of the couple's parents. The Nicobarese men value the women economically because they not only take care of household duties, but also tend to the plantations and gardens. The villages on the islands consist of sporadically placed huts strewn about in designated areas. The huts are normally round with dome-shaped roofs. They are typically raised above the ground and have ladders that the residents pull up after they climb into the huts at night. Economy The Nicobarese have a traditionally horticultural economy; they base their monetary existence on the growing of coconuts, pandanus, areca nut palms, bananas, mangoes and other fruits. They also hunt, fish, raise pigs, make pottery and make canoes. Many of the older Nicobarese are illiterate, however today the younger Nicobarese receive free education through the government. Nicobarese are becoming educated over time and they are seen in multiple government jobs as doctors, teachers, policemen and clerks, among other occupations.

Biography Isidore Bernard Dockweiler was born in Los Angeles on December 28, 1867, when the small city's population was less than 4,500, to Heinrich Dockweiler (Henry Dockweiler) and Margaretha Sugg. He was affectionately called \\"Pequeno Ysidro\\" by Bishop Francisco Mora y Borrell, then the prelate of La Iglesia de Nuestra Se√±ora la Reina de los √Ångeles in Los Angeles, who personally baptised him. Dockweiler would serve in his youth as Mora's \\"train bearer\\". He graduated from St. Vincent College (now Loyola Marymount University) in 1887. Dockweiler was admitted to the practice of law October 14, 1889, practicing for 58 years. He married Gertrude Reeve, and he and his wife had 13 children, 11 of whom grew to adulthood. Several became attorneys. John Francis Dockweiler would become a Congressman, and later Los Angeles County District Attorney. George Dockweiler would become a superior court judge. Dockweiler served on the Board of Directors of Security First National Bank (1922‚Äì1947). Politics Dockweiler was the Democratic Party candidate for Lieutenant Governor of California in 1902, along with Franklin K. Lane as Governor of California. Governor-Elect Lane and Lt. Governor-Elect Dockweiler won the electorate's plurality by 25,000 votes, but lost on a minor legal technicality decided by the California Supreme Court - a controversial event. Republican George Cooper Pardee became Governor of California as a result. Dockweiler helped secure California's vote for Woodrow Wilson, who would become President of the United States. Dockweiler was held in high esteem and confidence by Wilson. Lane served as U.S. Secretary of the Interior. When Lane resigned in 1920, Dockweiler was offered the position. Dockweiler declined due to family responsibilities of 11 children. Instead he was appointed by Wilson to the United States Board of Indian Commissioners (1913‚Äì1920). He had numerous positions throughout his life, both local and national. He served as President of the Los Angeles City Library Commission. He was the Director of the Los Angeles Public Library (1897‚Äì1899) and as ex- President of same (1901‚Äì1911). Dockweiler was defeated in the August 31, 1926 Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate nomination for California, losing to John B. Elliott. Elliott was the contestant sponsored by the then former U.S. Treasury Secretary William Gibbs McAdoo. Dockweiler served thrice as a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions of 1908 (Denver), 1936 (Philadelphia), and 1940 (Chicago). He served as a member of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) (1916‚Äì1932). Will Rogers once characterized Dockweiler as \\"the Democratic Party of California\\". Personal life Dockweiler, a Roman Catholic, was awarded a pontifical knighthood by Pope Pius XI in the spring of 1924, as a Knight of St. Gregory (KSG) for meritorious service to the public, humanity, and the Catholic Church. He was a charter member of the Knights of Columbus. One of his sons, Thomas A. J. Dockweiler, would also receive knighthood later as a Knight Commander of Saint Gregory (KCSG). In 1931 Dockweiler was instrumental in having a statue of Jun√≠pero Serra, the founder of the first Spanish missions in California and their Mission Indian Reductions, placed in Statuary Hall in Washington, D.C. He was also instrumental in getting a bill passed in the California Legislature making it the law to fly California's state Bear Flag with the U.S. Flag in or on public buildings. This would eventually be followed by other states for their state flags. Isidore B. Dockweiler died at St. Vincent Hospital on February 6, 1947. He was interred in Calvary Cemetery (New Calvary Catholic Cemetery) in East Los Angeles. Legacy Two streets, Dockweiler Street and Dockweiler Place, are named after him in Los Angeles. Isidore became aware of an effort to name a transportation arterial after him. Being humble, he did not like the idea. That street was eventually named Doheny (Edward Laurence Doheny), now part of Beverly Hills, California. By an act of the U.S. Congress, Dockweiler Station Post Office, was named in his honor in Los Angeles. In 2019, this station was renamed in honor of singer Marvin Gaye. On January 26, 1955, the California State Parks Commission upon request of California Governor Goodwin Knight renamed a portion of the then Venice- Hyperion Beach State Park in Playa del Rey to the Isidore B. Dockweiler Beach State Park, commonly known as Dockweiler Beach, to honor him and the contributions to the public by the Dockweiler Family. Dockweiler served as a member of that same commission from his appointment by California Governor Earl Warren on March 22, 1943 until his death.

Under the law, the commander of the Coast Guard is a Navy officer who is appointed and relieved of duty by the President of the Republic at the government's proposal.  Organizational structure and vessels  Ships of Croatian Navy under the Command of Coast Guard: *Coast Guard Command *1st Division - Split **OB-01 Novigrad **OB-02 ≈†olta **OB-31 Omi≈° **B≈†-72 Andrija Mohoroviƒçiƒá **SB-73 Faust Vranƒçiƒá **PT-71 Meduza **Tug LR-71 *2nd Division - Pula **OB-03 Cavtat **OB-04 Hrvatska Kostajnica **Tug LR-73 Croatian part of Adriatic Sea is also controlled by Croatian Police - Maritime department and Harbormasters‚Äô offices (Luƒçka kapetanija) whose ships are marked similar to Navy ships. Besides the warships, the Coast Guard has at its disposal two Pilatus PC-9 aircraft and four Mil Mi-8 helicopters of the Croatian Air Force and Defense. Current fleet status The cornerstone of the Coast Guard forces are four former Yugoslav Mirna class patrol boats (OB-01 through 04). They have recently been upgraded with new radars and their stern anti-aircraft guns have been replaced with hoists for a semi-rigid inflatable. These are to be augmented and eventually replaced by an entirely new class. Coast Guard possess one new offshore patrol ship OOB-31 Omi≈° built in Brodosplit which is lead ship in future class. Future developments Construction of the first out of the projected 5 shore patrol vessels (additional 10 were planned for later) was scheduled to start in 2007, however due to the onset of the economic crisis the international tender for the construction of 1 + 4 vessels was published only on April 24, 2013. The tender calls for the acquisition of a total of 5 inshore patrol ships (Croatian obalni ophodni brod, OOB) which are to be 43.5 meters long, with a displacement of roughly 220 tons and a maximum sustained speed of at least 28 knots. They are to be armed with a 30 mm Remote weapon station as their main armament along with two 12,7 mm heavy machine guns and 4 MANPADS launchers. The tender was completed in May 2014 and the construction of the first ship was to start in the last quarter of the same year. As projected, the first vessel was to enter service in 2015, the second one in 2016, the third and the fourth in 2017 and the last one in 2018. Units are projected to cost around 10 million euros respectively (375 million kuna for first 5 ships). However, the first ship (prototype) was laid down in September 2015D.

It boasts a sensitive script as the psychiatrist Waheed falls in love with and woos young widow (and mother of a young daughter to boot) Zeba, a romance that was decidedly different for its time. Complications obviously arise but the movie remains surprisingly mature and for the most part doesn‚Äôt turn into a typical Lollywood melodrama. Filming During the shootings of Ehsaan, Zeba got married with Mohammad Ali, an arch rival of Waheed Murad. Zeba, instead of reaching Karachi for completing her shootings and honoring her commitment, probably went on a honeymoon. That meant dismantling of the film's set and a big financial loss to Film Arts. Waheed on being told of Zeba‚Äôs marriage blurted out, \\"not again!... She is turning into an Elizabeth Taylor,\\" he said, after a pause. The film was shot in Eastern Film Studio of Karachi.

It follows a man in the middle of an existential crisis as he gets drawn into a strange pleasure-obsessed cult. The film's title loosely refers to the treatise On War, by Carl von Clausewitz. Plot Bertrand (Mathieu Amalric), a film director, is conducting research for his latest film, and asks a funeral director if he can stay back at his parlour after the close of business. Bertrand cannot resist getting into a coffin, and accidentally knocks the lid down, locking himself in. When he's released the following morning, it's clear he's been profoundly affected by the experience. That night, he considers hiring his regular prostitute, but cancels after a film on TV‚ÄîDavid Cronenberg's eXistenZ ‚Äì grabs his attention. The next day‚Äîstill ignoring his girlfriend, Louise‚ÄîBertrand encounters a group of policeman on the street and is momentarily confused when he's unable to find a specific reason why they're there. In the evening, he returns to the funeral parlour, where a strange man, Charles (Guillaume Depardieu), breaks in with him. After asking Bertrand to describe his experience in the coffin, the man eventually takes him to a countryside mansion, the headquarters to a cult called The Kingdom. Book I ‚Äì The Nature of War The cult's leader, Uma (Asia Argento), a young woman who tapes her breasts and wears conservative clothing, tells Bertrand that if he wants ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù, he must join them in their ‚Äúwar‚Äù. Although initially uncomfortable about being denied access to a phone, and unsettled by the sexual advances of a younger member, Maria (L√©a Seydoux), Bertrand soon befriends a fellow member called Rachel and finds himself taking part in activities designed to bring him closer to the ‚Äúpure existence‚Äù experienced by people like the Native Americans (photos of whom line the walls of the mansion). These activities include: trust exercises; crawling up and down a sand patch on all fours; touching, and being touched by, a partner; wandering the woods in animal masks; simulated sex; receiving a form of communion from Uma; and listening to Uma read pornography. After the group spend a long evening dancing in the woods, Bertrand watches a woman in a Venetian mask strip naked and drift into the river. Unable to swim, he sits on the bank and watches. His two-week trial period with the cult complete, he returns to the city and attempts to explain what he's been through to his girlfriend, Louise, making mention of his transcendent moment with the woman in the river. Unable to re-adjust, however, (and visited by a violent dream in which a man has his eyes gouged out with scissors), he quickly decides to drop his film and return to the cult, now more committed to its cause than ever. Book IV ‚Äì Commitment Things grow weirder as Uma introduces Bertrand to a room of sculptures resembling skinless bodies. Around this time, he also starts to move in and out of a dream-state, imagining that he's a soldier in a trench fighting against an unseen enemy. His \\"beautiful\\" performance in the trenches earns him Uma's praise. Louise visits the mansion but, unable to understand the cult, simply ends up wandering its grounds. Shortly after, a concerned friend of Bertrand's visits but is promptly expelled by him for suggesting that he leave the cult. Meanwhile, a young man, Pierre, who was being groomed by Charles to ‚Äúcarry the sword‚Äù as a lieutenant in the organisation, accidentally shoots himself in the head with a rifle. Uma, distraught, consults with an authoritative older man, Le Grand Hou, possibly a former leader of the group. After reminding her that she's a good \\"warrior\\", he enigmatically asks her if she'd ever hoped that the sky would rend before her eyes. Her answer is \\"Yes, often\\". Book VII ‚Äì Attack In his dream-state, Bertrand is now a lieutenant and carries a sword. Hunting through the forest for animals (which we hear but don't see), he tells us in a voice-over that his task now is to kill Colonel Kurtz, which is the same task given to Martin Sheen's character in Apocalypse Now. He drifts down the river (apparently able to swim in the dream-state) but stops when he comes across Pierre's wrapped-up body. The meaning behind the presence of Pierre's body in Bertrand's dream is ambiguous. Back in reality, Bertrand decides that it's time to say goodbye to Uma and leave the cult once more. She warns him one last time about the difficulties he will face on the outside. The film ends with Bertrand sat on a bench back in the city, smiling as he listens to Bob Dylan.

They have recently relocated to London. Though the band is a duo (Axel being the composer, singer and bass player while Vincent on production, engineering and keyboards), they have additional musicians on bass and drums for live performances. The Penelopes are also remixers, producers, and DJ. History=Early years The Penelopes‚Äô danceable indie-pop style developed from a rare creative partnership and longstanding friendship. The duo had known each other since they were children in Northern Paris, discovering music throughout teenage years, listening to bands like Cocteau Twins, New Order and The Cure. In an interview with the Daily Star the band said, \\"we grew up in a very cosmopolitan but poor suburb. The area was like Manchester. It was rainy and industrial, which might explains why we love dark British music so much\\". In juxtaposition to this, they told Wonderland Magazine, \\"the funk, disco, and rap music we heard growing up outside our windows was what influenced our dance approach.\\" This explains why the band often thanks the French Hip Hop band such as their neighbours, Supr√™me NTM in their albums. Axel said to Artrocker, \\"we want to beautify our life. We are searching for a light. We‚Äôre not like those spoiled kids who pretend to be dirty to be cool. Our songs are about simple pleasures, about taking a trip, about the great escapes, about all kind of fantasies, about friendship and poverty, about searching for the light.\\" Vincent went on to study law and Axel studied medicine, one of the reasons being they could stay as students for a longer while to avoid working in offices or factories. The two eventually followed their passion and pursued careers in music. Axel and Vincent formed The Penelopes and started making music in the rock and electro scenes around Paris. The first deal was on DJ Hell's International DeeJay Gigolo Records. Style and influence The Penelopes' Logo by Parris Wakefield The Penelopes‚Äô style is a mix of indie and dream pop, combined with disco and electro tight groove, layered with lush and melodies. Their major influences are Cocteau Twins, The Cure, New Order, The Smiths, David Bowie, Joy Division, Devo, and Happy Mondays. The band often mentioned Ride, Slowdive or Prefab Sprout, which Axel considered it as \\"guilty pleasure\\". The press often references The Penelopes to Pixies, Daft Punk, M83, and Air. Axel told Digital Spy about their sound, \\"It‚Äôs a really difficult question ‚Äì the background of The Penelopes are very rock and very new wave ‚Äì then we tried to incorporate disco and electronics. It‚Äôs disco rock music.\\" And on lyrics, Axel explained, \\"we like to have twisted lyrics ‚Äì the lyrics are more twisted than people think. They are more bizarre and we want people to dance to them\\". 1883 Magazine said about The Penelopes‚Äô music, \\"with swirling layers of lush keyboard, punchy guitars and catchy hooks, their upbeat sound is just how you want to start and end your day\\". \\"Spacey and energetic, airy and atmospheric\\" was the review from This Is Fake DIY. First album: The Arrogance of Simplicity In 2007 the first album The Arrogance of Simplicity was released under Vitalic's label, Citizen Records. Rock Mag describes it as ‚Äúa night club with feelings inside‚Äù. Les Inrockuptibles said ‚Äúthe duo gave their best in the delicate exercise of writing pop songs, with many influences (The Cure for bass lines, Cocteau Twins on ‚ÄúDemian‚Äù, New Order on ‚ÄúPaddy Will Have His Revenge‚Äù, even Techno on ‚ÄúTeenage Dust‚Äù)‚Äù. The band explained in Wonderland Magazine, ‚Äúwe love post- punk music in general but we didn‚Äôt want to copy our idols. So we started to explore electronic music alongside rap and other contemporary club music. We made our first album in our bedroom. We were naive and we wanted to experiment with sounds‚Äù. The single ‚ÄúDemian‚Äù was performed by the former singer of Ekova - Dierdre Dubois. The song refers to the Hermann Hesse‚Äôs book and was chosen for Perrier commercial. A year later the album was re-released as a limited edition in Japan, under the title Choose: Arrogance, Simplicity or Both. It included a remixed version of \\"Demian\\" by Black Strobe and a cover of the Elli et Jacno track \\"Je t'aime tant\\", sung as a duet with the world-renowned French writer Chlo√© Delaume. The song was commissioned by French fashion designer agn√®s b. and formed a part of the \\"Les Jeunes Gens Modernes\\" exhibition. Agnes has become a long-term supporter of the band and they have gone on to perform at many fashion events and appear in a number of fashion shoots. Though The Penelopes won the Best Discovery 2007 Qwartz Electronic Music Award, they felt more like a rock band using electronic tools. Side project with DJ Morpheus: Priceless Concrete Echoes The side project Priceless Concrete Echoes was released in 2009, with major contributions from DJ Morpheus and produced by Black Strobe, again on Citizen Records. A US version was also released (their debut US release), featuring an alternative track listing. The album was also licensed by Sony BMG in Hong Kong. The video of single \\"Stuck in Lalaland\\" was featured on Pitchfork, and the same song was remixed by Nouvelle Vague, in which Axel sang in duo with Elli Medeiros. The second single \\"Licked by Love\\" was remixed by I Monster. The cover Beastie Boys‚Äô \\"Sabotage\\" was licensed by Ministry of Sound. Second album: Never Live Another Yesterday The Penelopes relocated from Paris to London in 2012 and formed Pour Le Monde Records. They felt the music scene in UK was more open for their brand of electropop music. They explained to Wonderland Magazine, \\"In UK, we feel we are different from the other British bands, which is good. We have the same influences and approaches as others but we bring also a disco edge and a very continental electronic approach in our sound\\". The album Never Live Another Yesterday has an electro, indie-pop infused sound. The first single was ‚ÄúNow Now Now‚Äù, followed by ‚ÄúSally in the Galaxy‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSummer Life‚Äù. The album ‚ÄúNever Live Another Yesterday‚Äù was produced by Dan Grech- Marguerat, who also produced for acts such as Scissor Sisters, The Vaccines, Lana Del Rey, and Keane. Ollie Evans from Partizan (Tom Vek, Gossip, Foals, Klaxons) directed the first video ‚ÄúNow Now Now‚Äù. The video ‚ÄúSally in the Galaxy‚Äù was directed by Saman Keshavarz, who also directed for !!!, Russ Chimes, and Placebo. The singles were remixed by Gigamesh, Viceroy, Miguel Campbell, and The C90s and \\"Summer Life\\" Gigamesh remix got on #2 on Hype Machine. The album received great reviews from magazines and blogs such as Artrocker, The Guardian, Clash, Les Inrockuptibles, Harder Blogger Faster, and TopMan Generation. The songs were played across national and regional radio stations in UK, including supports from Chris Hawkins (BBC Radio 6 Music), John Kennedy (XFM), Huw Stephens (BBC Radio 1), and Dermot O‚ÄôLeary (BBC Radio 2). They also appeared on Channel 4 (Sunday Brunch). The Penelopes toured with The Human League on their 'XXXV Tour' in Belgium and UK at the end of 2012 (17 shows including the Royal Albert Hall). Digital Spy reviewed, ‚Äúcore pair Axel Basquiat and Vincent T have come to London and are chucking us their latest single ‚ÄúNow Now Now‚Äù. With just that right mixture of eager-to-please grooves and rock star diffidence, The Penelopes feel just one big chorus away from a serious breakthrough. They even managed to make us forget, briefly, that we‚Äôre about to see electropop godfathers (and mothers) The Human League‚Äù. The band had also played at The Liverpool Sound City, The Great Escape, and NXNE in 2013. Present Cannes Film Festival 2014 saw The Penelopes music feature in two films, the first being La Contribution, which was directed by Chlo√© Delaume & produced by Canal+. The band created the entire soundtrack for this short film, while providing two songs for Asia Argento‚Äôs directorial feature Misunderstood, which features Charlotte Gainsbourg. Besides the usual red carpet spectacle, Axel Basquiat and Vincent T.‚Äôs time at Cannes included DJ sets at a boat party for ARTE and a pop-up for David Lynch's Club Silencio. They returned in 2015 and again in 2016 where they performed at a number of parties including the festival‚Äôs closing ceremony for La Semaine de la Critique. Echoing the success of their 2013 remix of David Bowie‚Äôs ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Dance‚Äù, The Penelopes most recent remix of The Cure's ‚ÄúJust Like Heaven‚Äù became an underground hit with support from the likes of Rob da Bank at BBC Radio 1, Kissy Sell Out, Eddy Temple Morris at XFM, Tensnake, Little Boots and Hot Chip. During this period the band were asked to remix Pet Shop Boys single ‚ÄúLove Is a Bourgeois Construct‚Äù, which was produced by Stuart Price. This later led to other landmark remix projects including Lana Del Rey‚Äôs \\"Ultraviolence\\" and \\"Brooklyn Baby\\". In 2016 The Penelopes released a cover of Depeche Mode‚Äôs ‚ÄúNever Let Me Down Again‚Äù and were approached to remix the Starwalker (Jean-Beno√Æt Dunckel of Air and Bar√∞i J√≥hannsson) single, \\"Holidays\\" The Penelopes also produced in 2016 the soundtrack to a new art exhibition for agn√®s b.: ‚ÄúUn Autre Monde Dans Notre Monde‚Äù Sync and remixes The Penelopes‚Äô music is widely used in brands and commercials such as Perrier, Eastpak, Grey Goose, Fitbit and BPI Bank. \\"Now Now Now\\" was featured in Electronic Arts The Sims 3 and sung in Simlish. The song \\"Licked by Love\\" was used for trailer for movie Motorway. The band is also loved by the fashion world and had supported from brands such as Prada, Ben Sherman, Cheap Monday, Topman, G-Star, and both agn√®s b. and Jean-Charles de Castelbajac for whom they have also performed at their fashion shows. They have also produced a wide range of remixes for the likes of David Carretta, Zoot Woman, Puppetmastaz, The Chevin, Back Back Forward Punch, Tom Tom Club, Pet Shop Boys, The Ting Tings, Alt-J, Monarchy and most recently Say Lou Lou x Lindstr√∏m, Starwalker, Lana Del Rey and Citizens! . Their approach is often \\"mixing pop songs with a contemporary and edgy production\\". The band can often be heard DJing around UK in places such as 1234 Shoreditch Festival, Proud Camden, KOKO, Queen of Hoxton, and Dalston Superstore and throughout Europe at the likes of Berghain and Razzmatazz. Live performances Even in their early years, The Penelopes band had already played in many major festivals such as Dour Festival, S√≥nar, Monegros, Santander, Garorock, Radio France Festival, MoMA PS1, and Transmusicales de Rennes. They had also supported Ladytron, Vitalic, and The Human League among others. Other than France and UK, they have also played live across the world including Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Germany, Russia, USA, South America, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Taiwan.

It is headquartered in Fremont, California. After its acquisition in 2016, effectively all products and services are sold through Tesla's website. The company, in partnership with Panasonic, manufactures solar module components in Tesla Giga New York, a factory in Buffalo, New York. In August 2019, Tesla announced they would begin renting solar systems to customers in six states starting at $50 a month, in a plan to boost residential solar deployments. In July 2020, Tesla claimed \\"Tesla Solar is the lowest-cost solar in the United States\\" with a price of $1.49 per watt for solar panels when including federal tax credits. History SolarCity was founded in 2006 by brothers Peter and Lyndon Rive,Solarcity Time Magazine, April 17, 2008. based on a suggestion for a solar company concept by their cousin, Elon Musk, who was the chairman and helped start the company.Newsmaker: Elon Musk on rockets, sports cars and solar power, news.cnet.com, Michael Kanellos, February 15, 2008. By 2009, solar panels it had installed were capable of generating 440 megawatts (MW) of power. In 2011, the company launched their expansion to the East Coast with the acquisition of the solar division of Clean Currents and groSolar. Following the acquisitions, SolarCity expanded operations on the East Coast and opened in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Florida, Vermont, and New Hampshire. In 2013, SolarCity was the leading residential solar installer in the U.S.Is the SolarCity Model the Only Way to Scale Residential Solar?, greentechmedia.com, Nicole Litvak, March 31, 2014. and Solar Power World magazine listed it as the number two overall solar installation company in the U.S. In 2013, SolarCity purchased Paramount Solar from Paramount Equity for $120 million. By 2015, its installed panels were capable of generating 870 MW of solar power and accounted for approximately 28% of non-utility solar installations in the U.S. that year. In October 2014, SolarCity announced it would be offering up to $200 million in solar bonds, and would launch a new online website to allow purchasing the bonds; this was the first registered public offering of such bonds in the United States.SolarCity offers $200 million solar bonds in first public offering. Reuters, 16 October 2014 In March 2016, SpaceX bought $90 million of SolarCity stock. In late 2015, SolarCity withdrew from solar sales and installation in Nevada, following the decision by the state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to raise the monthly service charge for rooftop solar customers and progressively reduce the return on solar energy sold back into the grid under the state's net metering rule. Under the new rules, the monthly service charge imposed on Nevada Power's rooftop solar-generating customers rose from $12.75 to $17.90, and was scheduled to rise to $38.51 by January 1, 2020; simultaneously, the rates given to rooftop solar generating customers for their surplus solar energy were also clawed back and were to continue to decline over the ensuing four years. As a result, SolarCity eliminated more than 550 jobs in Nevada. 2016 workforce reduction During 2015, the number of employees had grown by 69%; at the end of 2015, SolarCity had 15,273 employees. To preserve cash, SolarCity eliminated 20% of its total workforce in 2016, and at the end of 2016, it had 12,243 employees. This was the first time in the company's history that it cut its workforce. The job cuts affected workers across the entire company: 22% of jobs were cut in operations, installations, and manufacturing and 27% in sales and marketing. In August 2016, the company announced that it planned to take up to $5 million in charges to cover its planned layoffs. The company also cut the salaries of its two co-founders from $275,000 to $1 per year.Allana Akhtar, WGRZ. \\"SolarCity announces layoffs, cuts executive pay to $1.\\" August 19, 2016. August 23, 2016. Subsidiary of Tesla Inc. (2016 ‚Äì present) On August 1, 2016, Tesla announced (in a joint statement with SolarCity) that it would be acquiring the company in an all-stock $2.6 billion merger. Tesla's mission since its inception has been \\"to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy\\". As part of Elon Musk's \\"The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan\\", Tesla sought to expedite the world's move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy. The announcement cited (as benefits of the acquisition) operational and cost synergies, as well as integrated products. The proposal for acquisition was approved by antitrust regulators. Musk unveiled a new solar roof tile in October 2016 in order to gain investor support for the acquisition. However, the tiles on display were later revealed to be fake. Members of the anti-Tesla group TSLAQ have cited Musk's solar roof tile reveal as a major point of contention and an impetus for organizing. The solar roof was being produced in volume in March 2020. More than 85% of unaffiliated shareholders from Tesla and SolarCity voted to approve the acquisition on November 17, 2016, allowing the acquisition to close on November 21, 2016. (Affiliated shareholders are those who hold executive positions at either company, such as Elon Musk.) Some investors criticized the deal, calling it \\"a misguided effort to rescue two companies that depend on investors and the government for operating cash.\\" There is ongoing litigation against Musk and Tesla's board of directors, alleging \\"they overpaid for SolarCity, ignored their own conflicts of interest and failed to disclose 'troubling facts' essential to a rational analysis of the proposed deal.\\" In April 2017, the chief policy officer of SolarCity, John Wellinghoff, left SolarCity. In June 2017, Lyndon Rive left SolarCity, and Peter Rive left shortly thereafter. Gigafactory 2 (Giga New York) opened in Buffalo in late August 2017. Fred Lambert, Electrek. \\"Tesla starts solar cell production at Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, raises annual capacity goal to 2 GW.\\" Aug 31, 2017. Retrieved May 21, 2018. Total solar installations have been declining since the Tesla acquisition. Tesla's energy revenues increased from $1.12 billion in 2017 to $1.55 billion in 2018, but declined slightly in 2019 to $1.53 billion. Analysts believe that SolarCity has been \\"a big source of the cash-flow deficit\\" for Tesla in 2019.  Products and services (current) = Residential solar panel rentals  In the second quarter of 2019, Tesla quarterly installations fell to a new low of 29 megawatts, compared to SolarCity's installation of 253 megawatts in the fourth quarter of 2015 (before Tesla acquired it), and compared to 2,013 megawatts the residential leader Sunrun installed. In August 2019, Tesla announced they would begin renting solar systems to customers in six states starting at $50 a month, in a plan to boost residential solar deployments. In the first quarter of 2020, Tesla ranked third in residential solar installations with a 6.3% share (Sunrun was first with 11%, and Vivint Solar second with 7.6%).  Lowest cost solar in the U.S.  In July 2020, Tesla claimed \\"Tesla Solar is the lowest-cost solar in the United States\\" with a price of $1.49 per watt for solar panels when including federal tax credits.

In the product, the photovoltaic energy-generating devices and system make up an entire roof surface. He stated \\"It‚Äôs not a thing on a roof. It is the roof.\\" In late October 2016, assorted styles of solar roof tiles (made of a type of glass) were unveiled at Universal Studios' Colonial Street backlot street set. Also unveiled was the Tesla Powerwall 2, a home battery product designed to store surplus power, either from the solar system or from the grid. Consumer Reports compared the estimated economy of solar roofs to traditional roofing. In August 2017, limited production of tiles for the Tesla Solar Roof began at the company's Buffalo, New York Gigafactory 2 (Giga New York).Ayre, James. \\"Solar Roof Tile Production At Tesla‚Äôs Buffalo ‚ÄúGigafactory‚Äù Now Up & Running\\", CleanTechnica.com, September 7, 2017 After testing on employees' roofs, Tesla announced in January 2018 that it would begin installing the product on commercial customers' homes \\"within the next few months\\".Eckhouse, Brian. \\"Tesla's New York Gigafactory Kicks Off Solar Roof Production\\", Bloomberg.com, January 9, 2018 But in July 2019, Greentech Media reported that Tesla had connected just a dozen or so solar-integrated roofs to the grid.[https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/tesla-sets-record-for-ev- deliveries-but-losses-and-solar-shrinkage-persist#gs.8qszso Tesla Sets Record for EV Deliveries, but Losses and Solar Shrinkage Endure : 2019 is supposed to be ‚Äúthe year of the solar roof,‚Äù but Tesla‚Äôs solar business continues to wither], Eric Wesoff, 25 July 2019, accessed 23 October 2019 , Tesla was \\"still tinkering with the product three years after announcing the concept, having done trial installations with two different iterations so far.\\"Tesla‚Äôs new Solar Roof costs less than a new roof plus solar panels, aims for install rate of 1K per week, TechCrunch, 25 October 2019.

On October 25, 2019, Tesla announced Version 3 (\\"V3\\") of the solar roof design. Tesla estimates that the price of a solar roof would be less than a new roof plus adding solar panels approximately 80 percent of the time (when comparing competitive quotes). On March 16, 2020, Tesla reported that it had achieved its goal by producing 4 MW of solar roofs in a week, which it claims is enough for 1,000 homes. In July 2020, Tesla claimed that it had tripled solar roof installations in Q2 2020 over Q1 2020, without giving actual installation numbers.  Commercial solar panels  In May 2008, SolarCity completed what was, at the time, the largest commercial solar installation in San Jose, at the North Campus of eBay; in July 2008, SolarCity completed what was, at the time, the largest commercial solar installation in San Francisco, for British Motor Car Distributors, consisting of 1,606 solar photovoltaic panels. SolarCity introduced additional financing options for businesses in 2009 and built multiple solar projects for other large organizations including Walmart, Intel, and the U.S. military. In 2013, the company established GivePower as a non-profit branch of its solar business, which is an independent enterprise.  Installation technology  SolarCity acquired Zep Solar in 2013. , Tesla still uses Zep Solar's specialized mounts for solar panels that \\"snap together\\" on rooftops.  Energy storage  , Tesla promotes Powerwalls on the Tesla website when they sell solar panels or solar roofs.  Products and services (previous) =Solar leasing In 2008, SolarCity entered the solar leasing market with a new solar lease option for homeowners: leasing rooftop solar to customers who would pay no upfront costs. In exchange, customers paid for 20 years for power generated by those panels. SolarCity's solar lease allowed some homeowners to pay less each month than they previously paid for electricity from the utility company. The \\"no-money-down solar\\" business model became the most popular in the U.S. and increased installations, but it also added considerably to SolarCity's debt, accounting for about half of the company's over $3 billion debt in 2016. Beginning in 2017 (after Tesla acquired the company) its business model shifted to one where customers buy the solar systems with cash or via financing. Tesla, the parent company, decided to change from selling solar products door-to-door to only being sold in Tesla's stores and galleries, which Tesla believed would save on advertising. In June 2018, Elon Musk announced that Tesla would be pulling out of their solar sales partnership with Home Depot four months after national kickoff, initially aimed at growing sales of Tesla's solar and storage products.https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/06/12/tesla-pulls-plug-home- depot-solar-sales-four-months-after-kickoff/696101002/ On February 28, 2019, Elon Musk announced that Tesla would close ‚Äúmany‚Äù of its stores around the world and sell online-only, removing the only retail outlet for solar sales,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-solar/teslas-store-shuttering- strategy-may-pull-the-rug-out-of-solar-idUSKCN1QJ01C but later reversed his decision and kept most stores open. Electric vehicle chargers In 2009, SolarCity entered the electric car charging business by buying the SolSource Energy business of Clean Fuel Connections, Inc. In 2011, SolarCity announced a partnership with Rabobank to make electric car charging available for free to owners of Tesla Roadster cars traveling on U.S. Route 101 in California between San Francisco and Los Angeles. In 2012, Tesla independently started deploying their Supercharger stations in the United States, and , Tesla operates 16,103 Superchargers in 1,826 stations worldwide. Energy efficiency evaluations and retrofits In 2010, SolarCity acquired Building Solutions, a home energy audit firm, and began to offer energy efficiency evaluations and upgrades. SolarCity worked with Admiral's Bank of Boston in March 2012 to make a new loan available to finance energy efficiency improvements and expanded its energy efficiency services to the East Coast. SolarStrong project SolarStrong was SolarCity's 5-year plan to build more than $1 billion in solar photovoltaic projects for privatized military housing communities across the United States. It was announced in late 2011. SolarStrong is being carried out by SolarCity in cooperation with Lend Lease Group involving 124 military bases in 33 states. The financing is agreed with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, USRG Renewable Finance, and U.S. Bancorp. It had a partial $344 million federal loan guarantee through the United States Department of Energy Financial Institution Partnership Program; however, the guarantee was withdrawn after the project implementation started. The project started in 2011 with development of the Joint Base Pearl Harbor‚ÄìHickam in Hawaii, followed by Davis‚ÄìMonthan Air Force Base in Arizona. In 2012, the project continued with the Los Angeles Air Force Base in California, and Peterson Air Force Base and Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado. Energy storage In 2016, SolarCity ran pilot project to test a grid backup resource by installing GridLogic software and 10-kilowatt-hour Tesla Powerwall battery packs in 500 California homes.https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/pge-to-plug-enphase-smart- inverters-solarcity-storage-systems-into-new-derm This concept was also tested in Vermont.  Lawsuits and investigations =Buffalo Billion Buffalo Billion is a billion-dollar program from the administration of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to revitalize Buffalo, New York. One of the main features of the program is a 1.2 million square foot solar panel factory called SolarCity RiverBend. It will be owned by SolarCity. The factory \\"is expected to become the largest manufacturing facility in the Western Hemisphere when it opens\\". Hiring for the factory is expected in spring of 2017 and the factory is expected to begin producing solar cells by the summer of 2017. The factory will be located in an \\"innovation hub\\" called the High- Tech Manufacturing Innovation Hub at RiverBend. The state appropriated $750 million in funding for the hub. According to Daily Energy Insider, \\"The facility will have one gigawatt of annual solar capacity when it reaches full production and is expected to produce about 10,000 solar panels per day.\\" SolarCity is required to spend $5 billion over the next decade on the facility and create more than 1,460 direct manufacturing jobs. As of May 2016, federal investigators were investigating how money and contracts within the Buffalo Billion program were distributed. SolarCity was a partner in the program. The company intended to open a large solar panel factory on the Buffalo River. In May 2016, New York State officials postponed the approval of almost $500 million for the SolarCity project. According to The New York Times, Buffalo Billion will benefit \\"a tangle of well-connected players ‚Äì including developers and frequent donors to the governor ‚Äì who have feasted on Buffalo Billion money\\". On April 29, 2016, then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara (of the Southern District of New York) began an investigation into state construction projects and contracts. Buffalo Billion was a part of that investigation. Many companies have been subpoenaed, and have provided information, including SolarCity and the office of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. SolarCity is not the subject or focus of the investigation, and not involved in the vendor selection or contracting. The United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York is leading a federal inquiry into Buffalo Billion. Prosecutors subpoenaed several state institutions who were responsible for SolarCity and other components of the Buffalo Billion project. The subpoenas sought information about how government-funded programs were awarded and what the role was of state officials who selected the winners. Cuomo has strongly defended the project noting that there has been a decrease in unemployment and an increase in spending around the Buffalo area. In February, three executives who worked for LPCiminelli Development who were arrested in 2016 in a federal bid-rigging investigation motioned to have the case against them either dismissed or moved from Manhattan to Buffalo. The three men face a 14-count indictment for wire fraud and bribery and alleged bid rigging of the SolarCity RiverBend construction contract. Additionally, five other people have been charged with related crimes. The trials will begin in late spring of 2017. An Albany firm called Whitman Osterman and Hannah represented both LPCiminelli and Fort Schuyler Management Corporation, which was a subsidiary of SUNY Polytechnic that was awarded the contract to develop the site where SolarCity is being built. The governor's office said that the formal awarding of the SolarCity contract was made by Fort Schuyler on behalf of the state. On May 18, 2016, the Public Authorities Control Board delayed a meeting at which it was set to approve $485 million in new funds for SolarCity. As late as May 2016 SolarCity said that it was cooperating with federal agents who had been in contact with the company. The New York state legislature plans to approve a budget by April 1, 2017 that would give $500 million more into the Buffalo Billion program. In return, the legislature wants the Cuomo administration to put more transparency into how the money is spent. Oregon Attorney General investigation On March 30, 2017, The Oregonian said that Campaign for Accountability, a D.C.-based consumer advocacy group, and other groups have asked Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum to investigate solar panel sales practices that \\"are designed to trick homeowners into buying or leasing solar panels\\" in violation of Oregon's Unlawful Trade Practices Act. According to The Oregonian, the request to Rosenblum \\"singled out one company: California- based SolarCity. It outlined several complaints filed against the solar giant by Oregonians who claimed they'd been misled about costs, tax credits and energy savings by the company.\\" The Campaign for Accountability reviewed 58 complaints that consumers filed with the Oregon Department of Justice and said that the complaints indicated \\"a widespread pattern of apparent fraud and abuse by solar companies\\". The Oregon Solar Energy Industry Association, however, said that it examined the complaints and \\"found the numbers to be relatively low ‚Äì lower than those being cited by the Campaign for Accountability\\". Investigators determined that SolarCity attempted to \\"cheat the system\\" by inflating the cost of 14 commercial solar projects by more than 100% to qualify for higher state tax credits. SolarCity and its accountant were required to pay back $13 million to the state of Oregon. The investigation also found that \\"phony and misleading documents\\" were submitted for some projects, and there was a bribery scheme involving the projects' energy consultant and a state Energy Department manager. One of SolarCity's solar panel suppliers employed prisoners at the Federal Correctional Institution in Sheridan, Oregon to keep costs down. \\"Solar by Degree\\" project The company is involved in a case concerning Martin Shain, the lead energy consultant in a solar power project at two Oregon universities. Shain was indicted for forgery in Marion County in August 2016. He is a consultant for BacGen Technologies in Seattle, a key player in the controversial $24 million \\"Solar by Degree\\" project and is accused of \\"creating a phony invoice from a fictional subcontractor that was pivotal in getting nearly $12 million in tax credits from the Oregon Department of Energy\\". The project began in 2013 and was sponsored by the Oregon University System; thousands of solar panels, generating millions of kilowatt hours of energy per year, were constructed on 21 acres on the campuses of Oregon State University and the Oregon Institute of Technology in Klamath Falls. The state's case revolves around two documents, which include an invoice from Solar Foundations Systems dated February 25, 2011, and a December 2011 letter signed by Ryan Davies, the former head of RedCo, a Utah-based company, which was the second developer on the project. According to KOIN-TV, \\"The Davies letter reported $210,000 had been spent toward the project and that construction was progressing.\\" The Solar Foundations invoice contains details of the construction of solar arrays. The invoice was necessary to provide proof of work on the project to get tax credits from the state. The \\"Solar by Degree\\" project received the tax credits, but it was later shown that the company named on the invoice, Solar Foundations, does not exist. In addition, Davies claims he did not write nor has ever seen the RedCo letter in question and that his name was forged. Relying on this evidence, the state claims Shain forged both documents. Shain denies forging the invoice and claims it was given to him by someone else involved in the project. The tax credits involved were given to SolarCity, the third developer in the project, along with its financial backers. According to The Oregonian, \\"Those backers provide upfront financing for the projects in exchange for a share of the project revenues and the federal and state tax credits, which they can use to offset their own taxes.\\" SolarCity stated, \\"We financed and constructed the projects in accord with the requirements of the Oregon Department of Energy.\\" The company argues that the state hired Shain, and it had no knowledge of the phony documents in question, otherwise it would have not pursued the endeavor. Treasury Department inquiries In 2012, the Treasury Department began investigative interviews of solar firms regarding their fair market value calculations for constructed solar energy systems. The IRS has yet to determine whether or not these values have been inflated. In a 2016 federal filing, SolarCity wrote, \\"If the Internal Revenue Service or the U.S. Treasury Department were to object to amounts we have claimed as too high of a fair market value on such systems, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\\" The firm stated, however, that its values were correct and complied with the Treasury Department guidelines. If the Treasury Department or IRS disagrees, SolarCity and other firms could be forced to reimburse institutions that purchase their tax credits as investments. SolarCity received roughly $501.2 million in credits up until December 31, 2015. In SolarCity's 2015 annual report, a note was made stating that if the government determines misrepresentations were made, \\"the Department of Justice could bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to us\\". Customer litigation Since 2006, SolarCity has lowered the minimum FICO score required for customers to get the leasing deals. It uses the score of 650 (a \\"fair\\" credit rating) as the cutoff. However, between 2014 and 2017, SolarCity signed long-term lease agreements with at least 14 homeowner customers right before the customers defaulted on their mortgages. The company has been named in 139 lawsuits where it is the defendant in legal proceedings based on \\"residential foreclosure action\\". In its response, SolarCity said in a statement to the New York Times, \\"Out of more than 305,000 installed customers, SolarCity is currently involved in 139 such proceedings. The litigation is not adversarial ‚Äì being named in the foreclosure proceeding provides us with advance notice that we need to reassign a contract, and many are immediately resolved with the relevant bank.\\" Customer cancellation investigation The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began investigating Sunrun and SolarCity in May 2017, and were looking into whether they adequately disclosed canceled contracts. \\"Some customers say they canceled contracts after being strong-armed into solar-energy deals\\" and there have been hundreds of complaints to state attorneys general. The federal government is investigating whether solar companies are \\"masking how many customers they are losing\\". The SEC is involved because \\"investors use that cancellation metric as one way to gauge the companies' health\\". According to the Wall Street Journal, \\"To generate business, solar companies have long relied on thousands of salespeople who knock on doors, make hundreds of cold calls and even trail people as they shop at retailers like Home Depot Inc., according to salespeople, executives and homeowners.\\"  FCC receiving radio interference complaints  SolarCity installed SolarEdge inverter systems with a type of DC-DC converter called an optimizer. These systems cause radio interference as documented in April 2016 QST magazine a publication of the ARRL. Federal settlement for allegations of False Claims Act violations In September 2017, as part of a legal settlement with the federal government, SolarCity agreed to pay a $29.5 million penalty regarding allegations that the company overstated the cost of facilities it developed and submitted claims for under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which would be a violation of the False Claims Act. SolarCity dropped its lawsuit, Sequoia Pacific Solar I, LLC v. United States‚Äîin which the company alleged the federal government owed it more money‚Äîas part of the settlement. As part of the settlement, the company agreed to ‚Äúrelease all pending and future claims against the U.S. for additional payments from the grant program\\". The move ended a five-year investigation. Vermont projects without approval In June 2017 the Vermont Public Service Board found that SolarCity was implementing solar projects in Vermont without approval required by law. According to Vermont Public Radio, Public Service Board Chair Anthony Roisman sent a letter to SolarCity warning the company that it needed to get regulatory approval before installing solar generation equipment and attaching it to the state's electrical grid. Roisman wrote, \\"Over the past few months, my office has observed a pattern of procedural issues with net-metering applications being pursued by your company.\\" Officials at the company worked quickly to respond to the issue. Faked sales numbers In July 2018, three former employees filed a lawsuit against SolarCity, alleging that the corporation had approved the creation of \\"fake sales accounts\\", which resulted in an \\"unreasonably high valuation of SolarCity\\" for investors. After allegedly informing management, including CEO Elon Musk, of these incidents, the employees were allegedly fired, which they argue contravenes California's whistleblower protection laws. A Tesla spokesman denied these allegations. On June 5, 2020, the case was dismissed with prejudice. Walmart lawsuit and Project Titan SolarCity installed and manages solar panels on the roofs of more than 240 Walmart stores. On August 21, 2019, Walmart filed a lawsuit against Tesla, seeking reimbursement for millions of dollars in damages and release from contracts, claiming that fires on the roofs of seven of those stores since 2012 were caused by SolarCity's \\"negligent installation and maintenance\\". On 5 November 2019 it was announced that Walmart Inc has agreed to settle its legal dispute accusing Tesla Inc of negligence in the installation of solar panels atop hundreds of its stores, resulting in at least seven fires. A joint statement provided by Tesla stated the companies said they were \\"pleased to have resolved the issues raised by Walmart\\" concerning the installations, and looked forward to \\"a safe re-energization of our sustainable energy systems.\\" Walmart had sued Tesla for breach of contract on Aug. 20 in a New York state court in Manhattan, seeking to have its solar panels removed from more than 240 stores. Walmart had accused Tesla of ‚Äúwidespread, systematic negligence‚Äù and ignoring prudent industry practices by relying on untrained and unsupervised personnel to install and maintain its panels, and prioritizing speed and profit over safety. Tesla's solar panel market share has been falling, prompting the Palo Alto, California-based company to cut its sales force. Revenue from Tesla's energy generation and storage operations from January to September fell 7% from a year earlier to $1.1 billion. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. Walmart had no immediate additional comment. Tesla and its respective lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. At around the start of the lawsuit, it was revealed that Tesla had initiated a secretive program, called Project Titan, to \\"replace solar-panel parts that could cause fires\\" as early as the previous summer. From a resource-perspective, Project Titan involved \\"ordering supplies including ladders and tool belts and sent crews out around the United States\\" to approximately 50 cities as well as replacements for the specific parts believed to be causing fires: Amphenol H4 connectors and SolarEdge optimizers. The Checks and Balances Project SolarCity indirectly funds a political advocacy group known as the Checks and Balances Project. The project has criticized the elected members of the Arizona Corporation Commission (the regulatory body that oversees electricity and utilities in Arizona) for being too well-connected to utility companies. The Checks and Balances Project has filed several requests for public records from the Arizona Corporation Commission. In July 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed the head of Checks and Balances as part of a larger criminal investigation into the financing of certain Arizona statewide races in 2014. Project financing and the Google Fund SolarCity partners with banks, large corporations, and the asset-backedSolarCity Announces Proposed Securitization Company press release, 4 November 2013 market to create project finance funds to finance its lease and PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) options. Among SolarCity's better-known financing partnerships was a $280 million fund created with Google to finance residential solar installations in June 2011. The Google Fund was the largest fund of its kind in the U.S., and Google's largest investment in clean energy. Giga New York In 2014, SolarCity announced plans to build a new manufacturing facility, also known as the Gigafactor 2, in Buffalo, New York, in coordination with the SUNY Polytechnic Institute after acquiring Silevo, a maker of high-efficiency solar modules. The initial manufacturing complex would be a facility that would cost $900 million and employ 1,500 workers in Buffalo and 5,000 statewide. With a planned capacity of one gigawatt of solar panels annually by 2019, the new plant would be the largest solar plant in the U.S. Groundbreaking for the project occurred in September 2014 with a target completion date of early 2016. The facility would be the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. Panasonic was to handle production at the Buffalo plant, investing $256 million. Panasonic and SolarCity/Silevo are developing similar but somewhat different HIT-technology, and Panasonic hopes to use SolarCity's wafers combining the two companies' technologies at an efficiency of 22%. SolarCity expects demand to outstrip the Buffalo production of 10,000 solar panels per day, and buys solar equipment from other manufacturers until more factories can be built. In February 2016, CEO Lyndon Rive announced that due to delays incurred in the supply of machinery for the plant, production would begin in summer 2017. New York State owns the building and most of the equipment, leasing it to SolarCity. Most of the work was completed by November 2016, when the Buffalo Billion project was under investigation, delaying state payments to contractors, but not influencing progress on completion of construction. SolarCity started hiring for the facility in December 2016. Elon Musk announced in 2017 that production of Tesla's solar roof products would be moved to the Buffalo facility at the end of 2017.Robinson, David. \\"Tesla says it will start making solar roofs in Buffalo by end of year\\", The Buffalo News, August 2, 2017 It was reported that as of August 2017, production of solar roof tiles had begun at the facility, and Tesla expected to continue to ramp up production through the rest of the year. By the end of 2018, the facility employed about 800 workers. The state of New York required the company to employ at least 1,460 workers at the facility by April 2020 or face a $41.2 million penalty, and in February 2020, the company reported having 1,500 workers at the facility. Panasonic announced that they will cease operations at the facility in May 2020. Trade organization and collaboration The company is one of the founding members of The Alliance for Solar Choice, or TASC, which is a rooftop photovoltaic power station solar trade organization. Government-funded collaboration The SunShot Initiative is a national effort to support solar energy adoption to make solar energy affordable for all Americans. It is run by the US Department of Energy's Solar Energy Technologies Office and funds research, development, demonstration, and deployment projects. It is a collaboration of private companies, universities, state and local governments, and nonprofits, as well as national laboratories. The program began in 2011 with the initial goal of making solar energy competitive with traditional forms of electricity by 2020. By 2016, the program achieved 70% of the progress towards the 2020 goal. In the fiscal year 2012 Congressional budget, the program was appropriated $457 million. According to the US Department of Energy's appropriation request for that year, \\"The program also encourages Systems Integration by developing radically new approaches to reduce the cost and improve reliability and functionality of power electronics and supporting industry development through test and evaluation standards, and tools for understanding grid integration issues.\\"\\"Overview: Appropriation by Program\\". Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. U.S. Department of Energy. Retrieved 2017-02-14. SolarCity was involved in a collaboration with the program along with the Energy Department's National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Hawaiian Electric Industries. Using government and taxpayer funds, SolarCity helped 2,500 Hawaii residential customers connect their solar power systems to the grid by the end of December 2015.

Biography Thomas Truax with 'The Hornicator' at the Innocent Village Fete August 2007 Truax first came to prominence as a solo performer in the 1990s in New York City as one of a group of musicians and songwriters (including Lach, Jeffrey Lewis, Curtis Eller, The Burning Hell, Dibs, Boo Hoo and Beck) who made up the antifolk movement based around the Sidewalk Cafe on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Truax's emergence as a solo act came after years of fronting bands (most notably Like Wow). The move was in part to remove the need to rely on other people to perform and to embark in a new direction that would distinguish his act from the hundreds of bands and singer-songwriters active in New York. This new direction involved the construction and playing of unique instruments, as well as more traditional singer-songwriter style songs. The \\"inventor\\" side of his musical act drew on his work as an animator on MTV's Celebrity Death Match and a fascination since early childhood with building objects out of whatever materials he had available. Thomas's use of \\"primitive\\" technology, the often fantastical elements of his songs and gothic overtones (his website talks of his instruments \\"as though plucked straight from the mind of Tim Burton\\") have led to him being linked to the subgenre of steampunk. Truax's first two instruments were the Cadillac Beatspinner Wheel and the Hornicator, the former being a system of spinning wheels, metal spokes and small cymbals, which, through the use of various contact mics, \\"beats out\\" through the PA a primitive drum beat that forms the backing to songs that Thomas then plays on guitar. Its large size made the Beatspinner Wheel unsuitable for touring, so Truax created a smaller version, entitled \\"Sister Spinster\\" that he uses to this day. The Hornicator started life as an old gramophone record horn, before Truax added a set of strings, a kazoo and a microphone. Here Thomas beats out the rhythm on the horn's metal casing (using a ringed finger to create a 'click' and other fingers to create a contrastive \\"thud\\") which is then repeated through the use of a looper pedal that records the beat and loops it over the PA, allowing Thomas to add more layers of other instrumentation (through the strings and other implements attached to the Hornicator). Finally Thomas sings a vocal through a microphone attached to the instrument. Other instruments work as variations on automatic rhythms and looped beats: the Stringaling features a vaguely bongo-like drum at the top of a length of clothes drier tubing to which is attached a variety of musical devices with pull-strings; Mary Poppins features a metal column attached to which are two arms that fly out to the side and spin, creating a train-like rhythm; the Backbeater, made up of several rotating spokes, straps on to Thomas' back and spins to create a low rhythm. Some songs do not feature any of his inventions, most notably \\"Inside the Internet\\" which is played solely on guitar, and \\"The Butterfly & The Entomologist\\", which is again played on a guitar, albeit with the use of a pocket fan that Thomas used to hit the strings to produce an eerie effect. Common themes in Thomas's songs include love, loneliness, travel, the animal kingdom, nature and technology. Truax was once challenged to show how he makes an instrument. Given many items retrieved from a recycle bin, within 15 minutes he created a rhythmic invention which he looped through effects with water and rubber bands. Though Truax usually only performs solo, his records contain songs with full band arrangements, along with his invented instruments. He has been featured in several music documentaries including Adam Clitheroe's \\"One Man In The Band\\" (2008) and Gabriel Shalom's \\"Instrumental\\" (2005). In 2013, Truax composed a new original score for Henrik Ibsen's play Peer Gynt, which was staged at the Theater Dortmund, Germany during its 2013/14 season, with music performed live by Thomas in an open metal container suspended above a stage of water.

It is set in Atlanta, Georgia where it was filmed on a very low budget, according to the writer-director.This is disclosed by Taylor in his commentary track on the DVD. It tells how two gay men on both sides of the law are brought together as intimate friends amid the dark events and circumstances that surround them.  Plot  When police detective Philip Kirsch (Ed Corbin) and college business student Oliver Beck (Dane Ritter), closeted gay men, are brought together, they end up outed at the same time. Detective Kirsch is working undercover to bust a drug ring that operates out of \\"The Blue Boy,\\" a back street, gay bar and brothel, at which Oliver works as the head hustler‚Äîhis calling card being his wearing red trousers. Oliver succeeds in hustling Philip, who subsequently falls in love with him. Philip uses his resources as a policeman to find out more about Oliver and his past, which he discovers to be dark and tragic. Philip runs into Oliver at his day job in a music store, and Oliver is grateful to him for his discretion in not letting on that he knows him. This friendliness quickly disappears when Oliver catches Philip following him. When he finds out that Philip is a police detective, that makes him even more undesirable to him. All this drastically changes when Oliver needs help later on. Although Oliver has the redeeming quality of caring for dependent people like his sister Lisa (Adele Phares), who is suffering from drug addiction, and befriending a mentally challenged adolescent, Mickey (Michael A. Newcomer), he cannot get over the guilt and self-loathing brought on by his causing the death of his close boyhood friend, Christopher Wingate (Erik Wingate), in a car crash brought on by his own drunken driving. He especially hates himself for avoiding drunk driving charges by moving his friend's dead body into the driver's seat of the wrecked car. He expresses his sorrow each night he begins work at The Blue Boy by going to the jukebox, selecting the song \\"Breathe\\" (written by Wes Yoakam and performed by him and his band PopCycle, also known as Catfish Jenkins), and dancing to it with tears in his eyes. It is when he is doing this that Philip Kirsch sees him the first night of his stakeout. It is Oliver's self-hatred and his fear of trusting anyone with his secrets that move him to control his sexual and emotional life by hustling. He is as successful at it as Philip is successful at being a police detective. Unfortunately, this causes them both to be surrounded by jealous rivals. Philip's associate detectives Grupe and Meyer are such rivals. Meyer is secretly involved in \\"The Blue Boy\\" drug ring from which Oliver gets heroin for his sister, and Oliver's knowledge of the drug ring, coupled with his growing connection to the investigating Kirsch, is a motive for Meyer to get rid of him by framing him with the murder of Mac, one of Oliver's best customers. Meyer poses as a mugger, who stabs Mac to death while he is getting money at an ATM. Oliver is with Mac at the time: he is driving Mac's car because Mac is intoxicated. Oliver, then, becomes a witness to the murder, noticing the curious luminous watch on the muffled mugger's wrist. In fear he drives away in Mac's car, but he realizes that he is in serious trouble. When Philip finds Oliver to talk with him, he warns him to go to the police so that he could be a witness rather than a suspect. Oliver is arrested for Mac's murder, but Meyer's plan is thwarted by Philip Kirsch, who provides an alibi for Oliver after he determines his innocence. Philip stands by Oliver when he is deserted by his friends and associates. Oliver is spurned by his girlfriend and boss Chloe (Alex Dawson), who is furious at him for being a gay hustler. He is barred and betrayed at the bar and is delivered to the police; and, even though he is released on the alibi Philip provided for him, he is evicted from his apartment with a week's notice by his landlady. Oliver has no one to turn to but Philip, who invites him to stay at his apartment. This support for Oliver is socially and economically costly for Philip: he is outed at work and suspended by his boss, police Lieutenant Krane (Roxzane T. Mims). When Oliver moves in with Philip they only begin sleeping together when Oliver looks upon their intimacy as love freely given rather than as purchased sexual favors. Oliver is uncertain about what he is to do about his \\"night job\\" in view of his developing bond with Philip, but he must continue to make money to supply heroin to his sister. The night that Oliver returns to his job at \\"The Blue Boy\\", Philip follows him to get him to quit hustling and exotic dancing and come home with him. Oliver sadly refuses, so Philip knocks him unconscious in the dressing room and takes him back to the apartment. Oliver is out of harm's way for Philip to go back to his police lieutenant with the information needed to bust \\"The Blue Boy\\" drug ring. When Oliver awakens, he finds himself handcuffed to the weight bench. He succeeds in freeing himself, but he finds in a desk drawer a luminous watch identical with that worn by Mac's murderer. He angrily leaves the apartment supposing Philip guilty of Mac's murder, and he continues to suspect Philip until he finds that Detective Grupe, who stops and picks him up on the street, is wearing one of the suspicious watches as well. Thinking Grupe to be the murderer, Oliver escapes from his car and returns to Philip's apartment. The luminous watches provide the mystery plot with two red herrings, and moments later in the film it is revealed that the police lieutenant had given her whole department these watches. At the apartment Philip is on the phone with his police lieutenant informing her of Oliver's disappearance when he is attacked from behind by Meyer, who knocks him unconscious and hangs up the phone. His plan is once again to frame Oliver with murder by killing Philip. Oliver's return to the apartment stops Meyer from killing Philip, but Meyer succeeds in wounding both Philip and Oliver in the struggle that ensues. Meyer is about to kill them both when he is shot and killed from behind by Det. Grupe. The last scene shows Oliver meeting Philip on the college campus some days later. Philip tests Oliver's reformation by asking him if he remembers his name. Oliver does and admits that he no longer considers Philip a john. They walk away up the sidewalk together.

Although these accomplishments were lauded by the press as a sign of McCardell's management expertise, the company had been setting records in key financial indicators for 20 years. More troubling were signs that the company was actually stumbling financially: The cost of new products was zooming out of control,Reckert, \\"Copier Maker's Costs on New Products May Slow Income Rise,\\" The New York Times, October 17, 1972. most of the company's growth was coming from overseas operations rather than the large American domestic market,Reckert, \\"Foreign Revenue Factor,\\" The New York Times, July 18, 1973. and Xerox seemed to have no clear strategic vision.Kilborn, \\"Can Xerox Copy Itself?\\", The New York Times, December 1, 1974.

He was named chief executive officer in January 1978.Jones, \\"McCardell, Harvester President, Is Also Elected Chief Executive,\\" January 20, 1978.

His actions boosted market share, and led to record sales of $8.4 billion and record profits of $370 million (up from $203 million). Despite McCardell's actions, IH's profit margins were still only half those of competitors like Caterpillar Inc. and Deere & Company.\\"International Harvester: The Strike Hurts,\\" The Economist, March 8, 1980. In the fall of 1979, rather than undertake more traditional cost-cutting measures, McCardell pressed for concessions from the United Auto Workers (a trade union which had represented Harvester's workers since the early 1950s). McCardell's inexperience at labor relations, his rigid bargaining stance, misjudgments about the union's ability to withstand a long strike, and other factors trigged a 172-day strike which began on November 1, 1979, and ended on April 20, 1980.Friedman, \\"Interaction Norms as Carriers of Organizational Culture: A Study of Labor Negotiations at International Harvester,\\" Journal of Contemporary Ethnography, April 1989.Flamholtz and Randle, Changing the Game: Organizational Transformations of the First, Second, and Third Kinds, 1998.

When a final agreement came, the union retained nearly everything McCardell had sought to change, and International Harvester had lost $479.4 million during the strike and $397.3 million in the next fiscal year. The strike severely impacted the company's financial status. International Harvester lost $257.2 million in the second quarter, for a total of $479.4 million in the first half of the year, while sales slid 47.3 percent.\\"International Harvester Reports $257 Million Loss,\\" Associated Press, May 15, 1980. The company put its utility vehicle division up for sale to help cover the losses, and by the end of April 1980 was forced to take out loans which increased its short-term debt from $442 million to a staggering $1 billion.\\"Harvester and A Unit Arrange $420 Million In Bank Credit Lines,\\" The Wall Street Journal, April 28, 1980. But International Harvester never recovered from the strike. In November 1981, IH asked the UAW for $100 million in wage and benefit concessions. Rising interest rates, demand weakened by the early 1980s recession, and high manufacturing costs pushed the company's total debt to a whopping $4.5 billion. On December 23, 1981, the company reached an agreement with 200 of its lenders to refinance $4.15 billion of its debt in a bid to avoid bankruptcy. McCardell announced $200 million in more cuts.\\"Harvester to Make $200 Million In Cuts,\\" Associated Press, January 12, 1982. On January 20, 1982, the UAW rejected Harvester's request for concessions because McCardell had just given $6 million in bonuses to salaried employees. But with the firm's financial condition rapidly worsening, the UAW reopened negotiations in March 1982.Williams, \\"Harvester: The Crisis Grows,\\" The New York Times, April 7, 1982. Negotiators reached a tentative agreement nearly two years to the day after the 1979-1980 strike ended, giving Harvester $200 million in wage, benefit, pension, and other savings over three years. International Harvester was also sued over McCardell's $1.8 million forgiven loan, and was unable to have the suit dismissed.\\"Harvester Sued About Loans,\\" Associated Press, June 25, 1981; \\"Harvester Loses Bid to Dismiss Suit,\\" The New York Times, May 8, 1982. On May 3, 1982, one day after the UAW ratified the concessionary contract, Archie McCardell was fired by International Harvester. Although McCardell asserted he had resigned, industry and press observers said that he was fired. Time reported that the company's 16-member board of directors met in a two-hour meeting over the weekend. Pushed by the company's debtor banks, the board finally agreed to fire McCardell. \\"The real wonder was that McCardell had not been ousted much earlier,\\" Time said. He was replaced as chairman and CEO by Louis W. Menk and president Warren J. Hayford was replaced by Donald D. Lennox.Williams, \\"Harvester Board Asks Fast Action,\\" The New York Times, May 24, 1982.New York Times,\\"Harvester Chooses New Chief Officer\\" November 10,1982 The company's downward financial spiral continued.

International Harvester sold its farm equipment division to Tenneco in 1985, and changed its name in 1986 to Navistar International.

It is of exceptional quality and importance, with a very complicated history both during and after its production. It contains several miniatures of about 1420 attributed to an artist known as \\"Hand G\\" who was probably either Jan van Eyck, his brother Hubert van Eyck, or an artist very closely associated with them. About a decade or so later Barth√©lemy d'Eyck may have worked on some miniatures. Of the several portions of the book, that kept in Turin was destroyed in a fire in 1904, though black-and- white photographs exist.Walther & Wolf, 238 Work on the manuscript began around 1380 or 1390, and over the course of almost sixty years involved a variety of artists, assistants and patrons during perhaps seven separate campaigns of work. Its conception and first leaves were commissioned by a high-ranking member of the French court whose identity is now lost, and involved mainly French artists. Before 1413 it was in the possession of Jean, Duc de Berry; by 1420 in that of John of Bavaria, Count of Holland, who contracted mostly Flemish artists. The early leaves are highly decorative and ornate and completed within International Gothic traditions, with stylized backgrounds but comparatively flat depth of field. The pages thought to have been compiled from the mid-1410s show particular skill in portraying perspective, especially those attributed to Hand G.Crawford, 14 History The Finding of the True Cross probably by Hand G, Turin The work was commissioned in about 1380 or 1390, perhaps by the person who later owned it, Jean, Duc de Berry, brother of Charles V of France, and the leading commissioner of illuminated manuscripts of the day. The original commissioner was certainly a great person of the French court ‚Äì Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, uncle of the King and Berry, has also been suggested.Ch√¢telet, 194 It seems to have been conceived, very unusually, as a combined book of hours, prayer-book and missal, all parts to be lavishly illustrated. The first artist involved was the leading master of the period known as the Master of the Narbonne Parement.a page by the Parement Master, or his workshop There was another campaign by other artists in about 1405, by which time the manuscript was probably owned by the Duke of Berry, who had certainly acquired it by 1413, when the work, still very incomplete, was given to the Duke's treasurer, Robinet d'Estampes, who divided it.Or it may have been divided by the Duke at this point ‚Äì see Walther & Wolf, 239. Harthan (p. 56) and Ch√¢telet (p. 194) state d'Estampes divided it. D'Estampes retained most of the actual book of hours, whose illustrations were largely complete, which became known as the Tr√®s Belles Heures de Notre-Dame.Confusingly not the same as the Tr√®s Belles Heures of Jean de France (Brussels Hours), another Berry manuscript, now in Brussels, mainly illuminated by Jacquemart de Hesdin This remained in his family until the 18th century, and was finally given to the BnF in Paris (MS: Nouvelle acquisition latine 3093BnF ) by the Rothschild family in 1956, after they had owned it for nearly a century. This section contains 126 folios with 25 miniatures, the latest perhaps of about 1409, and includes work by the Limbourg brothers.Walther & Wolf, 234 Robinet d'Estampes appears to have sold the other sections, with completed text but few illustrations other than the borders, and by 1420 these were owned by John, Count of Holland, or a member of his family, who commissioned a new generation of Netherlandish artists to resume work.Ch√¢telet, 27 ff. covers this period of ownership in the most detail. The Wittelsbach Counts of Holland were closely related to both the French and Burgundian branches of the Valois, the latter becoming the heirs of most of their territories. Kren, p. 83 states that the manuscript was first owned by John's elder brother William II, Duke of Bavaria-Straubing, who died in 1417. Ch√¢telet (p. 28) argues against this. See also Harthan, 56 It is the miniatures of this phase that are of the greatest interest. Two further campaigns, or phases of decoration, can be seen, the last work being of near the mid-century. The art historian Georges Hulin de Loo distinguished the work of eleven artists ‚Äì \\"Hand A\\" to \\"Hand K\\" ‚Äì in the work.Ridderbos, Bernhard; in Early Netherlandish Paintings, Bernhard Ridderbos, Henk Th. van Veen, Anne van Buren, Amsterdam University Press, 2004. 240. Hulin de Loo biography, arthistorians.info By this stage the manuscript appears to have been owned by, or at least was at the court of, Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy ‚Äì another argument for the involvement of Jan van Eyck who moved from the employment of the counts of Holland to the court of Burgundy, apparently taking the work with him. Most of this part of the work, the prayer-book section, known as the Turin Hours, belonged by 1479 to the House of Savoy, later Kings of Piedmont (and subsequently Italy), who gave it in 1720 to the National Library in Turin. Like many other manuscripts it was destroyed, or virtually so, in a fire in 1904. This portion contained 93 leaves with 40 miniatures.Finns Books However the missal portion of the work, known as the Milan Hours, was bought in Paris in 1800 by an Italian princely collector. After the fire, this part, containing 126 leaves with 28 miniatures, was also acquired by Turin in 1935,Some say bought, some say donated and is in the Civic Museum there (MS 47). Eight leaves had been removed from the original Turin portion, probably in the 17th century, of which four, with five miniatures, are in the Louvre. Four of the five large miniatures are by the earlier French artists, with one from the later Flemish phases (RF 2022‚Äì2025).Louvre images A single leaf with miniatures from the last phase of decoration was bought by the Getty Museum in 2000, reputedly for a million US dollars, having been in a Belgian private collection.Getty Museum Also No.1 in Kren & McKendrick. On the price, see this somewhat garbled report (last sentence, in French) The miniatures and borders Page from the French phase of work in the Paris Tr√®s Belles Heures by the Master of the Parement or his workshop. The borders have had small images added by the miniaturist The page size is about 284 x 203 mm. Nearly all the pages illustrated with miniatures have the same format, with a main picture above four lines of text and a narrow bas-de-page (\\"foot of the page\\") image below. Most miniatures mark the beginning of a section of text, and the initial is a decorated or historiated square. Often the bas de page image shows a scene of contemporary life related in some way to the main devotional image, or an Old Testament subject. The borders, with one exception, all follow the same relatively simple design of stylised foliage, typical of the period when the work was started, and are largely or completely from the first phase of decoration in the 14th century. These would have been done by less senior artists in the workshop, or even sub- contracted out. During the earlier campaigns, the borders are further decorated by the miniaturists with small angels, animals (mostly birds), and figures, but the later artists usually did not add these. The single exception to the style of the borders is a destroyed page, with the main miniature a Virgo inter virgines by Hand H. The border here is in a richer and later 15th century style, from 1430 at the earliest, partly overpainting a normal border, which has also been partly scraped off. This is probably because the original border contained a portrait of a previous owner, of which traces can be seen.Ch√¢telet, 198‚Äì99 and plate 29 The Paris Tr√®s Belles Heures probably originally contained 31 instead of the current 25 illustrated pages,Walther & Wolf, 235 which when added to 40 in the original Turin portion, 28 in the Milan-Turin portion, 5 in the Louvre and 1 in Malibu, gives a total of at least 105 illustrated pages, a very large number, approaching the 131 illustrated pages of the Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, which also took many decades to complete. The artists The French art historian Paul Durrieu fortunately published his monograph, with photographs, on the Turin Hours in 1902, two years before it was burnt. He was the first to recognise that the Turin and Milan Hours were from the same volume, and to connect them with the van Eyck brothers. Georges Hulin de Loo, in his work on the Milan portion published in 1911 (by which time the Turin portion was already lost), made a division of the artists into \\"Hands\\" A‚ÄìK in what he thought was their chronological sequence. This has been broadly accepted ‚Äì as regards the lost Turin portion few have been in a position to dispute it ‚Äì but attribution has been the subject of great debate, and Hand J in particular is now sub-divided by many. Hands A‚ÄìE are French, from before the division of the work, Hands G‚ÄìK are Netherlandish from after it, and Hand F has been attributed to both groups.Kren & McKendrick, 85 & n.9 on 87 crucifixion by Hand H, Turin The dating of the Hand G miniatures has been placed at various points between 1417 and the late 1430s. The pages attributed to him are universally agreed to be the most innovative; Hulin de Loos described these miniatures as \\"the most marvelous that had ever decorated a book, and, for their time the most stupefying known to the history of art. For the first time we see realized, in all of its consequences, the modern conception of painting... For the first time since antiquity, painting recovers the mastery of space and light\\"Quoted Kren & McKendrick, 83 Hulin de Loos thought these the work of Hubert van Eyck, who, like most art historians of the time, he also believed to be the main artist of the Ghent Altarpiece. He thought the less exciting, but similar, Hand H might be Jan van Eyck.Ch√¢telet, 39 Since then art historical opinion has shifted to see both Hand G and most of the Ghent Altarpiece as the work of Jan;Ridderbos, op. & page cit. Max J. Friedl√§nder,Friedlaender, pp. 8-11; he can be said to have begun this shift. Anne van Buren and Albert Ch√¢telet were among the proponents of this view. More recently, some art historians see Hand G as a different but related artist, in some ways even more innovative than the famous brothers.Kren, 83 Proponents of this view highlight the many close compositional, iconographical and typographical similarities to van Eyck's panel paintings of the 1430s.Crawford, 15 The pages attributed to Hand H include the Agony in the Garden, Way to Calvary and Crucifixion. They are usually dated after 1416-17, typically 1422-24, based on their style and on possible identifications of the donors. Hulin de Loo considered them van Eyck's \\"juvenilia\\"; Friedl√§nder and Panofsky associated them with the workshop of van Eyck. Although the leaves are not as refined and do not evince the same technical ability as those of Hand G, they contain realistic and unflinching depictions of human distress and a number of iconographic and stylistic innovations that suggest they are copies of prototypes by Jan.Sterling, 13 Charles Sterling notes similarities between Hand H and passages in the New York Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych miniature, a work for which completion dates as wide as 1420-1438 have been suggested, and which is known to have been finished by members of Jan's workshop.Sterling, 12 He notes the influence on van Eyck's successor in Bruges, Petrus Christus, who is known to have served as a journeyman in Jan's studio from the early 1430s. He suggests that the Agony in the Garden in particular was influential on painters in the 1430s, especially on southern German painters such as Hans Multscher and Lodewijck Allynckbrood who produced a number of works clearly indebted to Hand H.Sterling, 13-14 Eyckian landscape in the bas-de-page, below Gothic saints. Hands I‚ÄìK are all working in a similar Eyckian style, perhaps following underdrawing or sketches by Hand G, and are usually seen as members of Jan's workshop, although many now think work continued after Jan's death, which was by 1441 (Hubert had died in 1426). Many iconographical, as well as stylistic correspondences have been noted with other manuscripts and painting produced in Bruges from the 1430s on, and it seems clear that the manuscript was located there at this time. Numerous suggestions have been made as to their identities, mostly as anonymous illuminators named after a particular work. Hand K is the latest and generally the weakest of the later group, working up to about 1450, and \\"probably painting outside the workshop environment\\"; he is often identified as, or linked with, the Master of the Llangattock Hours.Kren in Kren & McKendrick, 84 Often the bas-de-page and main miniature are by different artists, as in the Getty's leaf, and also the borders and historiated initials. The style and identity of Hand G Hand G, who may or may not have been Jan van Eyck, paralleled the achievement and innovation of that artist's panel paintings in the miniature form, firstly in the technical development of the tempera medium and use of glazes to achieve unprecedented detail and subtlety, and also in his illusionist realism, especially seen in interiors and landscapes ‚Äì the John the Baptist page shows both well.Kren, 83, see also Ch√¢telet, pp. 28‚Äì39 and 194‚Äì6, who analyzes the Hand G (and H) miniatures at length. Many of the background portions of the attributed leaves seem concerned with the depiction of receding space, and it is often thought that in this aspect that the work of Hand G is most innovative. However, from the earlier pages he seems to be grappling with the techniques for the first time. He was successful early on in showing space receding over reflective water or within interior spaces, but appears to have experienced more difficulty with landscape.Crawford, 11 Early attempts, for example Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane in which three imposing figures in the foreground are presented before a distant hillscape, see him, perhaps crudely, eliminating the mid-ground to create the illusion of distance. Yet the underdrawing show him already experimenting with more effective and innovative techniques he was later to master, such as lowering the line of the horizon, and using radiating verticals to increase the sense of depth.Crawford, 12 Bas-de-page of the Baptism of Christ, Hand G, Turin. Milan Filio 93v, Inv 47. Only three pages at most attributed to Hand G now survive, those with large miniatures of the Birth of John the Baptist, the Finding of the True Cross ‚Äì not accepted by all ‚ÄìCh√¢telet (p.200) considers it mainly by Hand H (both shown above), and the Office of the Dead (or Requiem Mass), with the bas-de-page miniatures and initials of the first and last of these. Four more were lost in 1904: all the elements of the pages with the miniatures called The Prayer on the Shore (or Duke William of Bavaria at the Seashore, the Sovereign's prayer etc.), and the night-scene of the Betrayal of Christ (which was already described by Durrieu as \\"worn\\" before the fire), the Coronation of the Virgin and its bas-de-page, and the large picture only of the seascape Voyage of St Julian & St Martha.Kren, 84, note 1. Ch√¢telet, 34‚Äì35 and 194‚Äì196 ‚Äì all except the Coronation are illustrated there. The titles all vary between authors. Ch√¢telet additionally credits Hand G with parts of The Intercession of Christ and the Virgin in the Louvre (p.195) Examination under infra-red light has shown underdrawing for a different composition in the Birth of John the Baptist, who was the patron saint of John, Count of Holland.Ch√¢telet, 194‚Äì5 The unique and enigmatic seashore subject seems to illustrate an episode from the ferocious internal politics of the family, who can be clearly identified by the arms on a banner. Ch√¢telet suggests the Peace of Woodrichem in 1419, when John succeeded in wresting control of her inheritance from his unlucky niece Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut. The bas-de-page shows another landscape, of flat Dutch countryside, looking forward to the Dutch Golden Age painting of the 17th century.Ch√¢telet, 28‚Äì32, 194‚Äì5 The Prayer on the Shore by Hand G, destroyed in 1904 Ch√¢telet contrasts the Turin miniatures with those of the Limbourg brothers, which show faces in profile, with the clothes barely modeled onto the bodies, and the figures not integrated into the space of the miniature. In the Hand G images the figures are fully modelled, as are their clothes, shown from a variety of angles, and are rather small, not dominating the space of their setting. Chiaroscuro modelling gives depth and realism to both figures and setting.Ch√¢telet, 32 For Friedlaender \\"The local colours are adjusted to the dominant tone with inexplicable confidence. The gliding of shadows, the rippling of waves, the reflection in the water, cloud formations: all that is most evanescent and most delicate is expressed with easy mastery. A realism that the entire century failed to reach seems to have been achieved once by the impetus of the first attack\\".Friedl√§nder, 10 Kenneth Clark, who thought Hand G to be Hubert, agreed: \\"Hubert van Eyck has, at one bound, covered a space in the history of art which the prudent historian would have expected to last over several centuries\\", and singled out praise for the innovations in the subtle depictions of landscape. Of the seashore scene he says: \\"The figures in the foreground are in the chivalric style of the de Limbourgs; but the sea shore beyond them is completely outside the fifteenth- century range of responsiveness, and we see nothing like it again until Jacob van Ruisdael's beach-scenes of the mid-seventeenth century.\\"Clark, 31-32 Marine art historian Margarita Russell, describes the Hand G marine scenes as \\"capturing the first true vision of pure seascape\\" in art. Some (but not all) of the miniatures in the Limbourg brothers' especially ornate Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, which is contemporary or slightly earlier, contain innovative depictions of reflections in water, but these are taken further in the Hand G miniatures.Russell, 4-5 As Thomas Kren points out, the earlier dates for Hand G precede any known panel painting in an Eyckian style, which \\"raise[s] provocative questions about the role that manuscript illumination may have played in the vaunted verisimilitude of Eyckian oil painting\\". Otto P√§cht emphasized the \\"spatial conflict\\" that affected illusionistic manuscript miniatures, sharing the page with text, in a way that did not affect panel paintings: \\"the necessity of having to look into the page of the book, however cleverly contrived, meant that from now on the book housed a picture as an alien body on which it no longer had any formal influence\\".P√§cht, 200 Debate on Hand G's identity continues. Facsimiles Facsimile editions have been published of the surviving Turin section (1994:980 copies), accompanied by a large commentary,Turin-Milan Hours facsimile and separately of the BnF \\"Tr√®s Belles Heures de Notre Dame\\",Facsimile of the \\"Tr√®s Belles Heures de Notre Dame\\" and of the Louvre leaves (which includes photographs of the burnt Turin pages).Louvre leaves facsimile The 1902 volume of Durrieu has also been republished (Turin 1967), with new photographs from the original negatives, and a new introduction by Ch√¢telet.

The site was founded by Koos Plegt and Paul Neve in 2006 and became widely known after being featured on several television programmes across Europe and Australia.

The site was commonly referenced in the now defunct Australian gaming magazine Total Gamer and has become well known in New Zealand since it was mentioned on the Edge Nightshow by Brad Wattson that his cat 'Piggles' was the No. 1 \\"kitler\\" (kitty Hitler) in the world. The site was also mentioned fleetingly in The Social Network.

He continued to play for Devon, playing 43 matches for them in the Minor Counties Cricket Championship. He is the father of the Warwickshire cricketer Tom Allin. After many years as a dairy farmer, Allin successfully converted his farm near Bideford to worm-farming.

The type species for this section is Philodendron crassinervium. Additionally, philodendron within this section have plurilocular ovaries. Philodendron in the section Baursia are often confused with those of the section Philopsammos since they both are characterized by having long elliptical leaves. The two can be distinguished however because philopsammos philodendron have bilocular ovaries. References *Martius, Fl.Bras. 3(2): 134. 1878. *A. & C. de Candolle, Monog. Phanerog. 2: 387 (1879) *S.

The court is unique among the courts of Massachusetts and among state courts in general because its subject- matter jurisdiction is limited to disputes involving real property. Jurisdiction The court's geographic jurisdiction covers all of Massachusetts. The court usually sits in Boston, but may hold trials at other locations when necessary.Land Court Jurisdiction Exclusive jurisdiction The Land Court has exclusive and original jurisdiction over the registration of title to real property (discussed infra), over all matters and disputes concerning such title after registration, and over the foreclosure and redemption of real estate tax liens. Concurrent jurisdiction The Land Court shares jurisdiction over other property matters with other court departments. The court's jurisdiction overlaps significantly with that of the Massachusetts Superior Court in many instances, because the Superior Court has original jurisdiction in civil actions over $25,000, and in matters where equitable relief is sought.Jurisdiction of the Superior Court, from the Massachusetts Judiciary web site The court has concurrent jurisdiction with the Superior Court over specific performance of real estate contracts, over petitions for partitions of real estate, and over the processing of mortgage foreclosure cases. The Land Court shares jurisdiction with the Superior Court and the Housing Court over matters arising out of decisions by local planning boards and zoning boards of appeal.See M.G.L. c. 40A, ¬ß 17. Permit Session Beginning in August 2006, the Massachusetts Legislature established a separate session of the Land Court, known as the \\"permit session\\". This session has original jurisdiction over certain civil actions involving land use and environmental permitting. This jurisdiction is also concurrent with the Superior Court. Responsibilities of the court Apart from adjudicating cases, registration of title to real property is one of the Land Court's most important responsibilities. Registration of title under Massachusetts state law occurs when the Land Court, after having the title exhaustively searched by a Court-appointed examiner, and after due process is afforded to all interested parties, reviews and then adjudicates and decrees the state of the title. Once this process is complete, the current state of the title, as it is sequentially updated by registration of future transactions, is embodied in a certificate of title which both evidences and guarantees title, subject only to the exceptions provided by statute and matters of federal law. The initial decree of registration and the subsequent certificate of title are actions in rem. Registration is useful when title is insufficient to support a conclusion of ownership under the traditional recording system, or is clearly defective, and the putative owner desires to make the title good and marketable.History of the Land Court The court employs a staff of engineers and surveyors to help accomplish the task of determining land title and boundaries. The Land Court also has superintendency authority over the registered land office in each registry of deeds. History The Land Court was originally created by the Massachusetts Legislature in 1898 as the \\"Court of Registration\\". The court's name was changed to the \\"Court of Land Registration\\" in 1900, before it was finally given its current name in 1904. Over the first few years of its existence, the Court was brought into its current status as a court of record on a par with the Superior Court. Until the creation of the Massachusetts Appeals Court in 1972, it was the only court of statewide jurisdiction other than the Supreme Judicial Court.

Before the coup, Gabon was seen as one of the most politically stable countries in Africa. The coup resulted from M'ba's dissolution of the Gabonese legislature on 21 January 1964, and during a takeover with few casualties 150 coup plotters arrested M'ba and a number of his government officials. Through Radio Libreville, they asked the people of Gabon to remain calm and assured them that the country's pro-France foreign policy would remain unchanged. A provisional government was formed, and the coup's leaders installed Deputy Jean-Hilaire Aubame, who was M'ba's primary political opponent and had been uninvolved in the coup, as president. Meanwhile, M'ba was sent to Lambar√©n√©, from Libreville. There was no major uprising or reaction by the Gabonese people when they received word of the coup, which the military interpreted as a sign of approval. After being informed of the coup by Gabonese Chief of Staff Albert-Bernard Bongo, French President Charles de Gaulle resolved to restore the M'ba government, honoring a 1960 treaty signed between the deposed government and France when Gabon became independent. With the help of French paratroopers, the provisional government was toppled during the night of 19 February and M'ba was reinstated as president. Afterward, M'ba imprisoned more than 150 of his opponents, pledging \\"no pardon or pity\\" but rather \\"total punishment\\". Aubame was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor and 10 years of exile, a sentence that was later commuted. During this time, the ageing president became increasingly reclusive, opting to stay in his presidential palace under the protection of French troops. Within three years, M'ba was diagnosed with cancer; he died on 28 November 1967. Background and origins Gabonese and French military officers, 1959 Gabon gained its independence from France on 17 August 1960. The country had a relatively high standard of living and was considered one of the more stable countries in West Africa, both politically and economically. At the time of the coup, the country had an estimated US$200 average annual income and was one of the few countries in Africa with a positive trade balance, with exports exceeding imports by 30 percent. As of 1964, the country was among the largest producers of uranium and manganese in French Africa, which Time suggested was one of the reasons for France's response to the coup. It also had petroleum, iron, and logging interests stationed in Gabon. L√©on M'ba was one of the most loyal allies to France in Africa, even after the country's independence. In fact, France maintained 600 paratroopers and an air force unit, which included Mirage V and Jaguar jet fighters, at the Camp de Gaulle military base until at least 1987, a warning to any Gabonese coup plotters. M'ba famously commented during a 1961 visit to France that \\"[a]ll Gabonese have two fatherlands: France and Gabon\\", and Europeans enjoyed particularly friendly treatment under his regime. French journalist Pierre P√©an asserted that M'ba secretly tried to prevent Gabonese independence; instead, he lobbied for it to become an overseas territory of France. He went so far as to say that \\"Gabon is an extreme case, verging on caricature, of neocolonialism.\\" M'ba aspired to establish Gabon as a democracy, which he believed was necessary to attract foreign investors. At the same time, he attempted to reconcile the imperatives of democracy with the necessity for a strong and coherent government. In practice, however, M'ba showed a weakness in attaining his goal‚Äîby this time he was known as \\"the old man\\", or \\"the boss\\"‚Äîto have a high degree of authority. On 21 February 1961, a new constitution was unanimously adopted,. providing for a \\"hyperpresidential\\" regime. M'ba now had full executive powers: he could appoint ministers whose functions and responsibilities were decided by him; he could dissolve the National Assembly by choice or prolong its term beyond the normal five years; he could declare a state of emergency when he believed the need arose, though for this amendment he would have to consult the people via a referendum. This was, in fact, very similar to the constitution adopted in favor of Fulbert Youlou at roughly the same time. A report from the French secret service summarized the situation: M'ba's chief political opponent had been Jean- Hilaire Aubame, a former prot√©g√© and his half-brother's foster son. M'ba was backed by the French forestry interests, while Aubame was supported by the Roman Catholic missions and the French administration. Aubame, a deputy of the opposition party l‚ÄôUnion d√©mocratique et sociale gabonaise (UDSG) in the National Assembly, had few fundamental ideological differences with the M'ba- led Bloc D√©mocratique Gabonais (BDG), including advocating less economic dependence on France and faster \\"Africanization\\" of French political jobs. However, the new constitution and the National Union (a political union they founded) suspended the quarrels between M'ba and Aubame from 1961 to 1963. Despite this, political unrest grew within the population, and many students held demonstrations on the frequent dissolutions of the National Assembly and the general political attitude in the country. The president did not hesitate to enforce the law himself; with a chicotte, he whipped citizens who did not show respect for him, including passersby who \\"forgot\\" to salute him. Pesnot, Patrick (producer) & Billoud, Michel (director) (10 March 2007), 1964, le putsch rat√© contre L√©on M'Ba pr√©sident du Gabon [radio], France Inter. Retrieved 22 August 2008. Aubame served as foreign minister under the coalition government, though in early 1963 he was dropped from the Cabinet for refusing to create a single-party Gabon. To oust Aubame from his legislative seat, M'ba appointed him President of the Supreme Court on 25 February, practically a powerless post. M'ba supporters tried to pass a bill that declared that a member of parliament could only hold a single role in government. The president claimed that Aubame had resigned from the National Assembly, citing incompatibility with the functions of the assembly. Aubame, however, unexpectedly resigned from the Supreme Court on 10 January 1964, complicating matters for M'ba. In a fit of rage, M'ba dissolved the National Assembly on 21 January 1964. The New York Times speculates that this was due to it not supporting M'ba in Aubame's removal. The electoral conditions were announced as such: The election 67 districts were reduced to 47. M'ba disqualified Aubame by announcing that anyone who had held a post recently was banned. Any party would have to submit 47 candidates who had to pay US$160 or none at all. Thus, over US$7,500 would be deposited without considering campaign expenses. M'ba's idea was that no party other than his would have the money to enter candidates.. In response to this, the opposition announced its refusal to participate in elections that they did not consider fair. Planning Bongo in 2004 Little is known of the planning of the coup. No demonstrations followed Mba's dissolution of the National Assembly, so the coup could be classified as simply a \\"palace coup\\". The 1964‚Äì1965 edition of the Adelphi Papers speculates that the continued presence of young French military officers in Gabon may have been an inspiration to the plotters of the coup. Much of the 600-man Gabonese army had previously served in the French army prior to independence, where they were paid modestly. Like much of the rest of the country, they were displeased by M'ba's actions against Aubame, a probable cause for involvement. U.S. Ambassador to Gabon Charles Darlington suggested that the coup plotters may have tried to imitate the style of Colonel Christophe Soglo. Soglo, a commander in Dahomey's 800-man army, had deposed President Hubert Maga in October 1963, ruled for about a month, then resigned in favor of Dahomey's citizens. The plotters apparently did not consider French involvement, so therefore didn't take any additional steps to prevent it. They could have created protests to show public support, although the spokesman for the coup plotters, Sub-Lieutenant Daniel Mbene, justified the coup by claiming in a broadcast that the army had to act to avoid the rash of \\"uncontrollable demonstrations that would have been difficult to halt\\". It is unlikely that Aubame participated in the planning of the coup. It appears that he joined the effort after being recruited by the new government. His nephew, Pierre Eyeguet, a former ambassador to the United Kingdom, may have known of the plot beforehand and notified his uncle, although it is unknown whether or not Aubame established contact with the plotters. Lieutenant Valerie Essone only decided to participate on 17 February. This was a crucial decision for he led the First Company of the Gabonese Army, the company of the other officers. Apparently at that moment he told his troops to perform average night maneuvers. That day, Gabonese chief of staff Albert Bernard (later Omar) Bongo informed President M'ba that the number of troops outside Libreville was unusually high. M'ba, however, did not think much of this anomaly. Coup During the night of 17 February and the early morning of 18 February 1964, 150 members of the Gabonese military, gendarmerie, and police, headed by Lieutenant Jacques Mombo and Val√©re Essone, seized the presidential palace. The gendarmes on duty claimed that this was but a military exercise. However, during the \\"exercise\\" the lieutenants dragged President M'ba from his bed at gunpoint. Bongo heard this noise and telephoned President of the National Assembly Louis Bigmann to find out what had happened. Bigmann arrived at the presidential palace and asked the rebels what Bongo had asked him. At this point they opened the gates and arrested him too. The plotters subsequently arrested every member of the Gabonese cabinet except the respected technician Andr√© Gustave Anguil√©. Apparently, the plotters let him roam free in the hopes of him joining them, although before noon he asked to be arrested. Joseph N'Goua, the Gabonese minister of foreign affairs, was able to tell the French Embassy of this before he was arrested. The insurgents, calling themselves a \\"revolutionary committee\\", spread themselves strategically across the Gabonese capital during the night. They shut down the airport and seized the post office and radio station. On Radio Libreville, the military announced that a coup had taken place and that they required \\"technical assistance\\". They issued radio statements every half-hour promising that \\"public liberties will be restored and all political prisoners will be freed\\" and ordered the French not to interfere in the matter, claiming that it would be a violation of their sovereignty. In addition, they decreed the closing of schools and businesses. M'ba acknowledged his defeat in a radio broadcast, in accordance with orders from his captors. \\"D-Day is here, the injustices are beyond measure, these people are patient, but their patience has limits\\", he said. \\"It came to a boil.\\" During these events, no gunshots were fired. The public did not react strongly, which, according to the military, was a sign of approval. A provisional government was formed, composed of civilian politicians from the UDSG and BDG such as Philippe N'dong, editor of Gabon's literary review R√©alit√©s Gabonaises; Dr. Eloi Chambrier, Gabon's only physician; Philippe Mory, a famous Gabonese actor; and civil servant Paul Gondjout.. Mbene stated that the provisional government would not include any members of the M'ba government. He declared that Gabon's pro-French foreign policy would remain unchanged and that Mombo would supervise the government until the presidency was given to Aubame. The plotters were content to ensure security for civilians, urging them to remain calm and not hurt anyone. Most of them were junior officers, living in the army barracks. The senior officers did not intervene; instead, they stayed in their \\"pleasant\\" houses. Aubame was unaware of the coup until the French ambassador to Gabon, Paul Cousseran, called him on the telephone roughly a half-hour after sunrise. Cousseran, meanwhile, was awoken by the noisy streets and checked to see what was happening. Aubame replied that he was to find out why there was \\"no government\\", as Cousseran never directly mentioned a coup. However, about midway through the morning an automobile carrying the revolutionary committee arrived at Aubame's residence and drove him to the governmental offices, where he had been named president. Second Lieutenant Ndo Edou gave instructions to transfer M'ba to Ndjol√©, Aubame's electoral stronghold. However, due to heavy rain, the deposed president and his captors took shelter in an unknown village. The next morning they decided to take him over the easier road to Lambar√©n√©. Several hours later, they returned to Libreville. French intervention French authorities first received information on the coup not from Cousseran but rather from Bongo, giving him some standing among them. President de Gaulle, upon advice from his chief adviser on African policy, Jacques Foccart, decided that he would restore the legitimate government. This was in accordance with a 1960 treaty between Gabon and the French, which was signed by Aubame in his stint as Foreign Minister. Foccart, on the other hand, had only decided to launch the countercoup to protect the interests of the French petroleum group Elf, which operated in Gabon and was led by a close friend of his. M'ba was also a close friend of his; David Yates reports that M'ba could call Foccart personally, and Foccart would meet with him \\"at a moment's notice\\". French commentators, however, claimed that if they did not intervene, they would be tempting other dissidents. France had refrained from intervening in recent coups in the French Congo, Dahomey, and Togo, despite being opposed to all of them. However, the Gabon coup differed in that, they claimed, it lacked notable public support. Following the restoration of M'ba's government in Gabon, the French intervened militarily in Africa roughly every other year. In 1995, the French Minister for Foreign Assistance Jacques Godfrain explained that Paris \\"will intervene each time an elected democratic power is overthrown by a coup d'√©tat if a military cooperation agreement exists\\". Shortly after de Gaulle and Foccart's meeting, French commanders Haulin and Royer were released at the request of the French Embassy. Intervention could not commence without a formal petition to the Head of State of Gabon. Since M'ba was held hostage, the French contacted the Vice President of Gabon, Paul-Marie Yembit, who had not been arrested. At the time, Yembit was in a car with U.S. ambassador Charles Darlington travelling to N'Dende. This was to officially open a school built by the Peace Corps nearby, in Yembit's birthplace of Moussambou, and completing his electoral campaign. Therefore, they decided to compose a predated letter that Yembit would later sign, confirming their intervention. They sent this to him via a small airplane, since there were no road bridges in Gabon at the time and the only way to cross a river was on a ferry. Yembit did not come back to Libreville on the plane as would be expected, but rather at 8:00 WAT on 18 February to read a statement over Radio Libreville that was likely prepared by French officials. Yembit, however, claimed that he called for French intervention while the insurgent troops held M'ba hostage; this version of the story was quickly disputed by several diplomats on the scene, as several French troops had arrived before this alleged incident. Less than 24 hours after de Gaulle had been notified, French paratroopers stationed in Dakar and Brazzaville under General Ren√© Cogny and a General Kergaravat were notified that they were going to end the coup. This had come even before the provincial government was formed. Maurice Robert and Guy Ponsaille, who were among a group Foccart convened to discuss the French intervention, were part of the paratrooper unit. Receiving Foccart's orders to \\"normalize\\" the situation by 19 February or the next day at the latest, at 10:50 WAT on 18 February, the first 50 troops landed at the Libreville International Airport. The rebels closed the airport but failed to establish obstacles, allowing the French troops to land unharmed, albeit during a large storm. Throughout that day, more than 600 paratroopers arrived at the airport. Sweeping through Libreville unopposed, the troops easily captured the provincial council, though they met resistance at the Baraka military base in Lambar√©n√© when they attacked at daylight. Upon learning of the impending attack, Aubame called Cousseran and asked him what had been going on. Cousseran dodged answering the question and requested that Aubame release M'ba uninjured. After receiving the false assurance from the ambassador that the French government had no intention of restoring M'ba to power, Aubame sent out a military officer to the countryside to find the deposed president. M'ba was moved to a small village near the Albert Schweitzer Hospital. At dawn on 19 February, French Air Force Dassault MD 315 Flamant planes strafed the rebels at Baraka, while the French Army attacked the insurgents with machine gun fire and mortars. The rebels at the military base promptly surrendered once their ammunition supply ran out, and their commander, Lieutenant Ndo Edou, was executed. Later, the French army managed to break through the gate to the village where M'ba was held and rescued the deposed president. Before the end of the day, the French troops surrounded all of Libreville's public buildings. Shortly thereafter, Radio Libreville announced the surrender of the rebel forces. Kergaravat concluded his military operation on 20 February, saluting Cousseran and saying \\"Mission accomplie\\". Over its course, one French soldier was killed and 18 died on the Gabonese side. Unofficial sources said two French soldiers and 25 insurgents were killed, with more than 40 Gabonese and four French troops were wounded. The number of civilian casualties was unknown but numerous, as the straw roofs on their homes were not a good protector against aerial bullets. Aftermath=Immediate aftermath and riots The United States Embassy in Libreville France's intervention in the coup was openly applauded by the Central African Republic, Chad, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Niger, and Upper Volta. In fact, France was barely criticised at all in Africa, other than a mild response by Dahomey and one by the Democratic Republic of Congo. The matter was not discussed at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers of the OAU, held on 24 February‚Äì29 February in Lagos. The revolutionary movement in French Africa immediately retrogressed following the coup. M'ba was returned to Libreville on 21 February. Shortly after his arrival, the 10:00 pm curfew that had been imposed by the French was lifted, and some stores were reopened. Squads of officials, known as \\"les gorilles\\", travelled through Libreville and arrested any suspected M'ba opposers. After his reinstatement, M'ba refused to believe that the coup was directed against his regime, instead considering it to be a conspiracy against the state. Nonetheless, following the coup M'ba dismissed every soldier in the army and started recruiting new men. On 1 March, however, anti-government demonstrations began, with protesters shouting \\"L√©on M'ba, pr√©sident des Fran√ßais!\\" (\\"L√©on M'ba, President of the French!\\") and calling for the end of the \\"dictatorship\\". Originating in Libreville, these demonstrations spread to Port-Gentil and N'Dende and lasted into the summer. When 1,000 pro-government demonstrators responded by shouting \\"Long Live L√©on M'ba\\" outside the presidential palace, they were attacked by dissidents. Among the pro-government demonstrators were an opposition member, Martine Oyane, who had been forcefully undressed following her arrest, beaten by the police, paraded naked throughout Libreville, and forced to shout \\"Long Live L√©on M'ba\\".. At the height of these demonstrations, 3,000 to 4,000 Gabonese protested throughout central Libreville. Protesters also took their anger out against the French in Gabon, stoning more than 30 cars belonging to Frenchmen and chanting \\"Go home, go home!\\" This rioting was so intense that M'ba announced that whoever went to work would not be paid. The French reacted to these incidents by swinging rifle butts and throwing grenades. The crowds responded by throwing bottles and stones, though they were put down soon after. There were no reports of injured protesters, despite orders to the Gabonese police that they fire at protesters on sight. Allegations of U.S. involvement Some Gabonese mistakenly identified the United States as a co-conspirator in the coup. Time asserted that French officials helped spread the rumor of American involvement. This reached a point which some automobile stations refused to help Darlington and other Americans. After William F. Courtney, deputy chief of the United States Embassy, received a call from a man identifying himself as DuPont and threatening an imminent attack, a hand grenade exploded outside the embassy. The explosion, which occurred at a time when the building was closed and locked on 3 March, resulted in damage to the embassy sign and the cracking of two windows. Following the bombing, French Gabonese made more threatening phone calls to the embassy. A second bomb exploded at the embassy two nights later, causing no damage. A drive-by shooting, during which at least five rounds of buckshot were fired from a 12-gauge automatic shotgun, riddled the second story windows with over 30 holes. It is likely that its perpetrators were French, as Gabonese have no access to grenades. Following the second bombing a car containing white men was noticed, driving through otherwise empty Shore Boulevard. At the time, practically the only white men in Gabon were French. Two Gabonese policemen were assigned to protect the building, and M'ba ordered an investigation into the bombings. He denounced the allegations against Americans, saying: Many of these attacks against Americans were against Darlington personally. His son Christopher was hit by a grenade in July, though it did not detonate. The ambassador resigned his post on 26 July.. It was not until 14 August 1965 that David M. Bane replaced him. 1964 elections Despite these incidents, legislative elections planned before the coup were held in April 1964. They were originally to be held on 23 February, though he dissolved the National Assembly and rescheduled them for 12 April. Upon insistence of the French, M'ba allowed opposition candidates to run, which it claimed was the main reason for starting the coup in the first place. However, their leaders were barred from participating because of their involvement in the coup, and known anti-Mba organizers were deported to remote parts of the country. In addition, M'ba was known to have bribed voters with banknotes. France closely followed the election, deporting a Peace Corps teacher. The UDSG disappeared from the political scene, and M'ba's opposition was composed of parties that lacked national focus and maintained only regional or pro-democracy platforms. Nevertheless, the opposition garnered 46% of the vote and 16 of 47 seats in the assembly, while the BDG received 54% of the vote and 31 seats. The opposition disputed this, and held strikes across the country, though these did not have a sizable impact on business. Lambar√©n√© trial and rest of M'ba's term Aubame and Gondjout fled Libreville, but were captured sometime before 20 February. Most of the other rebels took refuge at the U.S. Embassy, though they were soon discovered and brought to jail. That August, a trial of the military rebels and provisional government was opened in Lambar√©n√©. A \\"state of precations\\" was imposed, which decreed that local government kept surveillance on suspected troublemakers and, if necessary, order curfew, while special permits were required to travel through the town. The trial was held in a school building overlooking the Ogooue River, which was near Albert Schweitzer's hospital. Space at the hearing was limited, so members of the public were disallowed from attending. Permits were required to attend the trial, and family members were restricted to one permit each. Press coverage was limited, and journalists were allowed only if they represented a high-profile news agency. In addition, there were restrictions on the defence of the accused.. The prosecution called 64 separate witnesses. Essone, Mbene, and Aubame claimed that their involvement in the coup was due to a lack of development in the Gabonese army. Judge Leon Auge, the judge in the case, said that if \\"that is the only reason for your coup d'√©tat, you deserve a severe penalty.\\" Essone said that almost all Gabonese military officers knew of an imminent coup beforehand, while Aubame affirmed his position that he did not participate in its planning. According to him, he formed the provisional government in a constitutional manner, and at the request of some \\"putschists\\". He reasoned that the French intervention was effectively an illegal act of interference, an assertion which Gondjout and the former education minister, Jean Marc Ekoh, shared. Ekoh had served as Foreign Minister during the coup. The Gabonese actor said that it should be the French troops being tried, not he and his comrades: \\"If we'd been able to put up a few more Gabonese soldiers against the French, we'd have won ‚Äî and we shouldn't be here today.\\". On 9 September, without consulting M'ba, Leon Auge handed down a verdict which acquitted both Ekoh and Gondjout; although the charges carried the death sentence as a maximum. Aubame was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor and 10 years of exile on a remote island off Settecama, down the coast of Gabon, as were most criminals of the case. He was not particularly popular during his political career, though according to Time, his arrest \\"ballooned him to heroic proportions in the eyes of the aroused public\\". While serving his 10 years of labor, he was beaten regularly by prison guards. Besides Aubame, M'ba imprisoned more than 150 of his opponents, most of whom were sentenced to 20 years of hard labor. These included the two officers and Aubame's nephew, Pierre Eyeguet, a former ambassador to the United Kingdom. The actor and the doctor were given 10 years of imprisonment each. While appealing for peace on 18 February, he pledged \\"no pardon or pity\\" to his enemies, but rather \\"total punishment\\". Two years after the coup there was still open repression of dissent in Gabon. Following these events M'ba became increasingly reclusive, staying in his presidential palace protected by French troops known as the \\"Clan des Gabonais\\". Not even Yembit was close to him, but Foccart's friends Ponsaille and Robert \\"were never far\\" from M'ba, according to Pean, and provided the aging president with counseling and advice. M'ba was, however, still convinced of his popularity. Three years later, M'ba was diagnosed with cancer, and he died on 28 November 1967. After M'ba's death, French-supported Bongo succeeded him as president, and released Aubame in 1972.

However, only six guns had been delivered by the end of World War I.Ortner, p. 505 Its post-war service is unclear, but it seems that it served in small numbers with the Austrian Army, although it doesn't appear that the Germans placed it into service following the Anschluss, possibly because it used non- standard ammunition. Gander and Chamberlain don't list it in their book, but the older work by Chamberlain and Gander claims it saw service with the German Army as the 8 cm leichte Feldkanone 18(√∂). A copy was also manufactured in China by Liao as \\"Type 14 77mm\\" since 1925. There seems to have been at least a few available to the Hungarian army during world war 2. It was a far more innovative design than Skoda's 8 cm FK M. 17. The carriage of the M 18 had a bent axle which allowed the whole carriage to traverse since the spade pivoted around a vertical pin, so that neither the spade nor the wheels had to be moved to traverse. For use in mountains it could be fitted with a special narrow set of wheels. For transport it broke down into three animal carts.  References  * Gander, Terry and Chamberlain, Peter.

The Society campaigned for greater protection against wrongful confinement or cruel and improper treatment, and for reform of the lunacy laws. The Society is recognized today as a pioneer of the psychiatric survivors movement. Background There was concern in the United Kingdom in the 19th century about wrongful confinement in private madhouses, or asylums, and the mistreatment of patients, with tales of such abuses appearing in newspapers and magazines. The Madhouses Act 1774 had introduced a process of certification and a system for licensing and inspecting private madhouses, but had been ineffectual in reducing abuses or allaying public anxiety.P. McCandless (1981) Liberty and lunacy: the Victorians and wrongful confinement. In A. Scull (ed), Madhouses, mad-doctors, and madmen: the social history of psychiatry in the Victorian era. London: The Athlone Press, 339-62. Doctors in the 19th century were establishing themselves as arbiters of sanity but were reliant on subjective diagnoses and tended to equate insanity with eccentric or immoral behaviour. Public suspicion of their motives was also aroused by the profits that were made from private madhouses. In 1838, Richard Paternoster, a former civil servant in the East India Company, was discharged after 41 days in a London madhouse (William Finch's madhouse at Kensington House) having been detained following a disagreement with his father over money. Once free, he published, via his solicitors, a letter in The Times announcing his release.S. Wise (2012) Inconvenient people: lunacy, liberty and the mad-doctors in Victorian England. London: The Bodley Head, 64. The letter was read by John Perceval, a son of prime minister Spencer Perceval. Perceval had spent three years in two of the most expensive private asylums in England, Brislington House in Bristol, run by Quaker Edward Long Fox, and Ticehurst Asylum in Sussex. His treatment had been brutal in the Brislington House; at Ticehurst the regime was more humane but his release had been delayed. Perceval contacted Paternoster and they were soon joined by several former patients and others: William Bailey (an inventor and business man who had spent several years in madhouses); Lewis Phillips (a glassware manufacturer who had been incarcerated in Thomas Warburton's asylum); John Parkin (a surgeon and former asylum patient); Captain Richard Saumarez (whose father was the surgeon Richard Saumarez and whose two brothers were Chancery lunatics); and Luke James Hansard (a philanthropist from the family of parliamentary printers).S. Wise (2012) Inconvenient people: lunacy, liberty and the mad- doctors in Victorian England. London: The Bodley Head, 68-72. This group was to form the core of the Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society, although the Society would not be formally founded until 1845. The group began their campaign by sending letters to the press, lobbying Members of Parliament (MPs) and government officials, and publishing pamphlets.S. Wise (2012) Inconvenient people: lunacy, liberty and the mad-doctors in Victorian England. London: The Bodley Head, 72. John Perceval was elected to the Board of Poor Law Guardians in the parish of Kensington (although he was opposed to the New Poor Law) and was able to join magistrates on their visits of inspection to asylums. Richard Paternoster and Lewis Phillips brought court cases against the people who had incarcerated them. John Perceval published two books about his experience. Richard Paternoster wrote a series of articles for The Satirist magazine; these were published in 1841 as a book called The Madhouse System.R. Paternoster (1841) The Madhouse System. London. Formation On 7 July 1845, Richard Paternoster, John Perceval and a number of others formed the Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society. A pamphlet published in March the following year set out the aims with which the Society was founded: > At a meeting of several Gentlemen feeling deeply interested in behalf of > their fellow-creatures, subjected to confinement as lunatic patients. It was > unanimously resolved:... That this Society is formed for the protection of > the British subject from unjust confinement, on the grounds of mental > derangement, and for the redress of persons so confined; also for the > protection of all persons confined as lunatic patients from cruel and > improper treatment. That this Society will receive applications from persons > complaining of being unjustly treated, or from their friends, aid them in > obtaining legal advice, and otherwise assist and afford them all proper > protection. That the Society will endeavour to procure a reform in the laws > and treatment affecting the arrest, detention, and release of persons > treated as of unsound mind...S. Wise (2012) Inconvenient people: lunacy, > liberty and the mad-doctors in Victorian England. London: The Bodley Head, > 79. John Perceval was listed as the honorary secretary, Luke James Hansard as treasurer, and Henry F. Richardson as honorary solicitor (Gilbert Bolden would later become the Society's lawyer). Sixteen vice-presidents included both Tory and Liberal MPs; notable amongst them was the radical MP for Finsbury, Thomas Duncombe. New legislation, championed by Lord Ashley, was being introduced in parliament (the Lunacy Act 1845 and County Asylums Act 1845) and the creation of a formal society put the group in a better position to influence legislators. Four days after the Society was founded Thomas Duncombe spoke in the House of Commons, arguing for the postponement of new legislation pending a select committee of inquiry, and detailing a number of cases of wrongful confinement that had come to the Society's attention.Hansard, Commons sitting, 11 July 1845. The legislation however went ahead, and the Society would have to wait until 1859 for an inquiry, although the Society's supporters in parliament managed to secure a number of clauses to safeguard patients in the 1845 Act.S. Wise (2012) Inconvenient people: lunacy, liberty and the mad- doctors in Victorian England. London: The Bodley Head, 82. Although the Society had influential supporters such as Thomas Duncombe and Thomas Wakley (surgeon, radical MP for Finsbury and coroner), they did not gain widespread public support, probably never having more than sixty members and relying upon their own money for funding.S. Wise (2012) Inconvenient people: lunacy, liberty and the mad-doctors in Victorian England. London: The Bodley Head, 78. A critical article in The Times of 1846 revealed the views and prejudices that the Society would have to counter: > \\"We can scarcely understand what such a society can propose to accomplish... > There have been, no doubt, many cases of grievous oppression in which actual > lunatics have been treated with cruelty, and those who are only alleged to > be insane have been most unlawfully imprisoned... These, however, are evils > to be checked by the law and not tampered with... by a body of private > individuals... Some of the names we have seen announced suggest to us the > possibility that the promoters of this scheme are not altogether free from > motives of self-preservation. There is no objection to a set of gentlemen > joining together in this manner for their own protection... but we think > they should be satisfied to take care of themselves, without tendering their > services to all who happen to be in the same position.\\"The Times, 27 March > 1846 p. 4. John Perceval replied that the law afforded patients insufficient protection, and that the Society existed to give legal advice to individuals and draw the government's attention to abuses as well as to encourage a more general discussion about the nature of insanity. In response to the article's reference to the fact that several members of the Society had been patients in asylums, Perceval had this to say: > \\"I would remind the writer of that article, that men are worthy of > confidence in the province of their own experience, and as the wisest and > best of mankind hold the tenure of their health and reasoning faculties on > the will of an Inscrutable Providence, and great wits to madness are allied, > he will do well to consider that their fate may be his own, and to assist > them in saving others in future from like injustice and cruelties, which the > ignorance of the fondest relations may expose patients to, as well as the > malice of their enemies.\\" The Times, 16 April 1846, p. 8. Social worker Nicholas Hervey, who has written the most extensive history of the Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society, suggested that a number of factors may have contributed to the lack of wider public support, namely: alignment with radical political circles; endorsement of localist views, rather than support of the Lunacy Commission's centralism; fearless exposure of upper-class sensibilities regarding privacy on matters concerning insanity, thus alienating wealthy potential supporters; attacks on the new forms of moral treatment in asylums (what John Perceval referred to as \\"repression by mildness and coaxing\\"). Achievements As well as lobbying parliament and campaigning through the media and public meetings, during the next twenty years or so the Society took up the cases of at least seventy patients, including he following examples: *Dr Edward Peithman was a German tutor who had been falsely imprisoned in Bethlem Hospital for fourteen years after he had tried to gain access to Prince Albert. John Perceval took up his case and, after the Commissioners in Lunacy released him in February 1854, took him home with him to Herne Bay. Dr Peithman promptly tried to speak to Prince Albert again, and was committed to Hanwell Asylum. Again Perceval obtained his release, this time escorting him back to Germany.S. Wise (2012) Inconvenient people: lunacy, liberty and the mad-doctors in Victorian England. London: The Bodley Head, 87-92. *Jane Bright was a member of a wealthy Leicestershire family, the Brights of Skeffington Hall. She was seduced by a doctor who took most of her money and left her pregnant. Soon after the birth of her child, her brothers had her committed to Northampton Hospital. On her release she enlisted Gilbert Bolden, the Society's solicitor, to help her recover the remains of her fortune from her family.\\"The Times\\", 21 January 1854, p. 11. *Anne Tottenham was a Chancery lunatic who was removed from the garden of Effra Hall Asylum in Brixton by Admiral Saumarez. This course of action was a rare exception to the Society's more usual rule of following legal routes to secure the release of patients who had been wrongly confined.S. Wise (2012) Inconvenient people: lunacy, liberty and the mad-doctors in Victorian England. London: The Bodley Head, 84.The Court of Chancery, under the Lord Chancellor, was responsible for the affairs of wealthy people who were considered insane. Relatives who were worried about family estates being squandered could apply to have someone declared insane by a lunacy inquisition with a jury deciding whether the person was of unsound mind or not. Chancery proceedings were notoriously lengthy and expensive. (The National Archives Mental health. ) *Charles Verity was serving a two-year prison sentence when he was transferred to Northampton Hospital. He contacted John Perceval in 1857 about abuses in the refractory ward and the Society secured an inquiry.396 The Commissioners in Lunacy reported in 1858 that charges of cruelty and ill-usage had been established against attendants and the culprits had been dismissed.S. Wise (2012) Inconvenient people: lunacy, liberty and the mad-doctors in Victorian England. London: The Bodley Head, 396.The Times, 4 August 1858, p. 9. Not all the Society's cases were successful: *James Hill (father of Octavia Hill) was a Wisbech corn merchant, banker, proprietor of the newspaper the Star of the East and founder of the United Advancement Society. He had been declared bankrupt and had been committed to Kensington House Asylum. After his release in 1851 the Society helped him sue the proprietor of Kensington House, Dr Francis Philps, for wrongful confinement but the case was unsuccessful. *Captain Arthur Childe, son of William Lacon Childe, MP, of Kinlet Hall in Shropshire, was a Chancery lunatic who had been found to be of unsound mind by a lunacy inquisition in 1854. The Society applied on his behalf for another lunacy inquisition in 1855, claiming he was now of sound mind. The Society was unsuccessful; the jury found Captain Childe to be of unsound mind and there was a quarrel about costs.The Times, 12 June 1855, p. 11 The Society was successful in drawing attention to abuses in a number of asylums. Notable amongst these was Bethlem Hospital, which, as a charitable institution, had been exempt from inspection under the 1845 Lunacy Act. The help of the Society was enlisted by patients and they persuaded the home secretary to allow the Commissioners in Lunacy to inspect the asylum. The Commissioner's critical report in 1852 led to reforms.Andrews, J. et al. (1997) The history of Bethlem. London: Routledge, 466-72. Together with magistrate Purnell Bransby Purnell, the Society ran a campaign to expose abuses in asylums in Gloucestershire. One of the aims of the Society had always been to persuade parliament to conduct a committee of inquiry into the lunacy laws. This, after numerous petitions, they finally achieved in 1859. John Perceval, Admiral Saumarez, Gilbert Bolden and Anne Tottenham (a patient they had rescued from Effra House Asylum) gave evidence to the committee. The results were disappointing; the committee made a number of recommendations in their 1860 report but these were not put into place. Legacy The Society's activities appear to have come to an end in 1860s. Admiral Saumarez died in 1866, and Gilbert Bolden had a young family and moved to Birmingham. In 1862 John Perceval wrote a letter to the magazine John Bull: > \\"I am sorry to say that this Society is so little supported, in spite of the > great good it has done, and is in consequence so entirely disorganised, that > I have repeatedly proposed to the committee that we should agree to a > dissolution of it, and I have only consented to continue acting with them, > and to lend my name to what is rather a myth than a reality, from their > representation that however insignificant we were, we had still been able to > effect a great deal of good, and might still be further successful...\\"John > Bull, 25 January 1862, p. 54. Nicholas Hervey concluded: > \\"The Society's importance lies in the wide panorama of ideas it laid before > Shaftesbury's Board. Unrestrained by the traditions of bureaucratic office, > it was free to explore a variety of alternatives for care of the insane, > many of which were too visionary or impolitic to stand a chance of > implementation. The difficulty it faced was the blinkered perspective of the > Commission and of Shaftesbury in particular... it would not be an > exaggeration of the Society's worth to say that patients' rights, asylum > care, and medical accountability all suffered with its demise in the 1860s.\\" The cause for lunacy law reform was taken up by Louisa Lowe's Lunacy Law Reform Association, whose aims were very similar to those of the Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society.L. Lowe (1883) The Bastilles of England: or, the lunacy laws at work. London: Crookenden, p. 155. In more recent years the Society has been recognised as a pioneer of advocacy and the psychiatric survivors movement.

Strategic defense is not always passive in nature. In fact, it often involves military deception, propaganda and psychological warfare, as well as pre-emptive strategies. All forms of military defense are included in the planning, and often civil defense organisations are also included. In military theory, strategic defense thinking seeks to understand and appreciate the theoretical and historical background to any given war or conflict scenario facing the decision-makers at the highest level. Therefore, to fully understand strategic defense activities, analysts need to have a detailed understanding of the relevant geopolitical and socioeconomic challenges and issues that faced the nation state or large organization being studied. Some of the more common issues encountered by strategic defense planners include: * Problems of security and confidence-building in interstate relationships in the strategic neighbourhood * National defense policy * Arms proliferation and arms control in the immediate strategic region, or within reach of the weapon systems in question * Policy advice to the higher levels of the national defense organisation * The strategic implications of developments in the nation's geographic region * Reviewing security agenda and formulating a new one if necessary Strategic defense is also a predominant peacetime posture of most nation-states in the world at any given time. Although national military intelligence services are always conducting operations to discover offensive threats to security to ensure adequate warning is provided to bring defense forces to a state of combat readiness. In terms of combat scale, a strategic defensive is considered a war that can last from days to generationsp.64, Dupuy or a military campaign as a phase of the war, involving a series of operations delimited by time and space and with specific major achievable goal allocated to a defined part of the available armed force. As a campaign, a strategic defence may consist of several battles,p.64, Dupuy some of which may be offensive in nature, or may result in the conduct of withdrawals to new positions, encirclements, or sieges by the defender or the attacker as a means of securing strategic initiative. The strategic goal of a strategic defensive may require a conduct of an offensive operation far removed from the main national territory, such as the case with the 1982 Falklands campaign, which sets logistics apart as the dominant consideration in strategic defensive as a doctrine.pp.249-288, Thompson See also * Defence in depth * Strategic depth NotesSources * Dupuy, Trevor N., Understanding War: Military History And The Theory Of Combat, Leo Cooper, New York, 1986 * Thompson, Julian, Lifeblood of war: logistics in armed conflict, Brassey's Classics, London, 1991 Recommended reading * The Adelphi Papers, Volume 359, Number 1, August 1, 2003 Stephen J.

It is owned by Wild Sky Media, which also owns Mom.com, CafeMom, Mam√°sLatinas, and LittleThings. History CafeMom was founded in 2006 by Michael Sanchez and Andrew Shue. In 1999, the childhood friends established CMI Marketing and subsequently ClubMom, the predecessor to CafeMom. ClubMom was a web site that provided parenting information in the form of blogs, articles and message boards. It also organized a shopping rewards program with sponsors. ClubMom ran until 2007, until it was shuttered in favor of CafeMom. CafeMom launched on November 15, 2006. Many ClubMom members were encouraged to join CafeMom to help it succeed. Shortly after its launch, it was described as a \\"MySpace for moms\\". The idea of CafeMom originated with Andrew Shue when he became a father and he saw how his wife counted on other mothers for support and information. Shue realized that there was a need for mothers to share and talk with other women and there was nothing out there that was bringing them together. Within one year of its launch, CafeMom became the most trafficked website for women according to comScore. In 2008, the website was receiving 8 million unique visitors a month, accounting for over 140 million page views. In September 2008, the website launched an initiative to donate $10 million to schools, while increasing traffic to the site. In 2009, the website launched a games section. On March 30, 2010, CafeMom announced the launch of The Stir, a blog for moms featuring topics such as celebrity gossip, parenting dilemmas, current events, and home decorating. It provides articles about parenting and issues surrounding children that members can comment upon and discuss. It also links to related stories on the site as well providing links to similar articles in the press, and gives links to Twitter and Facebook where members can continue the debate. Suburban Turmoil‚Äôs Lindsay Ferrier is a fashion columnist for the journal, after selling her style blog, She‚Äôs Still Got It, to CafeMom. The blog is interactive, allowing CafeMom followers to write in and ask questions, appeal for fashion advice and discuss trends. In 2010, the blog named Tina Fey as \\"Sexiest Mom Alive\\". In 2010, the site had $30 million in revenue. As of June 2010, the site offered 70,000 separate groups on topics ranging from astrology to gardening. In August 2010, Yahoo! evaluated acquiring CafeMom for as much as $100 million. CMI Marketing and Yahoo negotiated over the price. Other interested companies included The Walt Disney Company. In May 2011, the website launched Daily Deals and announced plans for a hispanic website. At that time, the website had 100 employees, $36 million in annual revenue, and 7.6 million unique monthly visitors. By 2012, the website was receiving 9 million monthly unique visitors and launched a YouTube channel. The YouTube channel offers workout videos and heartwarming stories.

The character was portrayed by Jasmin Lord and debuted on June 17, 2008.First appearance of Jasmin Lord as RebeccaFirst episode of Jasmin Lord as Rebecca In 2009, Lord earned the Miss Soap award as the most beautiful actress in a soap opera,Jasmin Lord is Miss Soap 2009 followed by the German Soap Award as Sexiest Woman in 2011.Jasmin Lord wins German Soap Award as Sexiest Woman It was announced on January 18, 2011 that Lord is going to leave the show and finishes shooting in April 2011.Announcement that Lord is leaving \\"VL\\" She made her last on-screen appearance on July 27, 2011.Lord's last appearance After a few months the character was recast with Tatjana K√§stel, who made her first on-screen appearance on February 13, 2012.Tatjana K√§stel takes over as Rebecca Creation=Introduction The character is hardly mentioned before she appears on-screen. It was only declared that Sebastian, then played by Joscha Kiefer, had siblings. Rebecca's first appearance featured a run-in with Gregor Mann, played by Andreas Jancke, who eventually became her first on-screen lover. Rebecca appeared to be a stereotypically rich and spoiled person, even though it's mentioned that Rebecca didn't grow up with much money, since her father ceased contact with his aristocratic family. She had a good relationship with Adrian Degenhardt, played by Klaus Zmorek, who was like a father to she and her siblings after her own father died. Personality Initially, Rebecca appeared to be a stereotype of a rich girl who enjoyed superficial pleasures. She loved to go shopping, especially out of frustration so she wouldn't have to come to terms with her personal problems. It was hinted that she did not grow up as lavishly as she later comes to be, so at first Rebecca treated the staff around her like less worthy citizens. Her spoiled way brings her character to be disliked by the audience. As time goes by and her character is developed, the audience also saw how Rebecca could be easily hurt, especially by those whom she loves. Trying to bring the best out in herself, Rebecca is normally shown as a good friend to people she liked and also seems to have little faith in herself when it comes to her proficiency. As time goes by, Rebecca becomes a strong woman who starts to know what she wants. With the return of her supposedly dead father Ludwig, she broke free of her past insecurities and flaws. Rebecca even began a romantic triste with waitress Miriam Pesch before the character was suddenly written out because of Jasmin Lord's departure. Verbotene Liebe altered the storyline so that Rebecca would move to New York. In 2012 Rebecca's character returned from New York City and was portrayed by Tatjana K√§stel. With Rebecca's return, the character is developed into a mature, polite, and wiser woman who is dedicated to pursuing a career as a fashion designer, though this can lead her to become a too engrossed in her work at times. Storylines=2008 - 2011 Rebecca is introduced by running into Gregor Mann, who she eventually takes a romantic interest in. But she originally came to town to visit her brother Sebastian. When Rebecca finds out that her foster father Adrian needs a kidney to save his life, she gets into a huge argument with his son Constantin, who despises his father. Constantin won't help Adrian because he believed him to be the kidnapper of his sister Carla's daughter Sophia. Rebecca and Sebastian can eventually convince Constantin to save Adrian, even though he doesn't change his mind about him. Rebecca starts sleeping with Gregor and develops feelings for him. Gregor tells Rebecca that he just wants to have fun and doesn't search for a serious relationship with her. Rebecca agrees and they continue to stay lovers. When Gregor eventually finds out that Rebecca has fallen in love with him, he breaks it off. She tries to convince him that a relationship between them could work, but Gregor falls in love with Luise von Waldensteyck instead. Rebecca tries to come between them for a while, even working together with Luise's sneaky fianc√© Eduard von Tepp. Eventually Rebecca realizes how much Gregor and Luise love each other and tries to overcome her feelings for Gregor. Rebecca succeeds when she takes an interest in Gregor's younger brother Christian. She tries to get closer to him when Christian starts having problems in his relationship with Oliver Sabel. Being friends with Christian and Olli, Rebecca doesn't want to come between them and tries to stay away. After a while things seem to have come back to normal and Rebecca finally finds someone who has taken an interest in her - David Brandner. He tries everything to finally give Rebecca a feeling of love and appreciation. But Rebecca realizes that she still has feelings for Christian. David is heartbroken and shortly leaves town after he and Rebecca broke up. Once again, Rebecca is questioning if she ever will find her \\"Mister Right.\\" As she starts to flirt with a guy, Rebecca realizes that she isn't really interested in him and has problems to get him to leave her alone. \\"No Limits\\" waitress Miriam Pesch helps out and kisses Rebecca. After that Rebecca starts to question her sexuality as she enjoyed the kiss with Miriam. The girls have a conversation and eventually kiss again. Rebecca fears what her family might think about it but starts to go overboard when she announces her relationship to Miriam. Agreeing that things moved too fast between them, Rebecca and Miriam broke up after a few weeks. After that Rebecca tries to concentrate on her career and gets involved with Tanja von Lahnstein, who's involved with her brother Sebastian. She starts working for Ligne Clarisse, a fashion company headed by Tanja. Rebecca gets to be creative in her designing clothes, but soon finds herself at odds with Tanja after confronting her over a controversial publicity campaign. Tanja feels threaten by Rebecca and falsely accuses her of stealing designs and passing them off as hers. As the family doesn't believe Rebecca and even Sebastian sides with Tanja, she is forced to take a job offer in New York City. Before leaving, however, Rebecca gets her revenge by playing the ambition of all members of the Lahnstein Enterprises board of Directors against themselves - with the exception of Helena and Hagen, promising them to sell them her voting rights in the company in exchange of valuable things, like an apartment in New York and a VIP card to get access to high-profile fashion events; turning the job in New York into a great opportunity. Rebecca leaves at odds with her family. 2012 - 2014 (The Marbecca Years)  In February 2012, Clarissa von Anstetten, who now owns fifty percent of Ligne Clarisse Lahnstein, brings Rebecca back to town to impress Ludwig on his birthday and stabilize her place in the Lahnstein empire. Rebecca forgives her father and shows her family that she has grown up a lot while being in New York and now knows what she wants. As Clarissa promised her a position at Ligne CL, Rebecca demands that she gets her own fashion line or she would return to New York after all. Tanja isn't happy about Rebecca's return at all. After Tanja blackmails Clarissa of her shares of the company, Rebecca makes it known that she won't answer to Tanja. As Elisabeth is named co-CEO of Ligne CL, Rebecca goes strictly to her. During mid-2012, VL developed a storyline that Rebecca would begin to develop feelings for her close friend Marlene von Lahnstein (n√©e Wolf), who, at the time, was dating her brother Tristan. The story began when Rebecca was under pressure to design a swimsuit collection called \\"Wet Fantasy\\" for Tanja von Lahnstein. Rebecca produced several sketches of the prototype for the collection whilst also helping her friend Marlene come to terms with body dysmorphia after being raped a few months prior. Overwhelmed with deadlines and her earnest desire to help her friend, Rebecca is forced to redraw her designs from scratch after Tanja dismisses the collection. Marlene, who is best friends with Tanja, appeals to her to give Rebecca more time. In their conversation, Marlene reveals that Rebecca has helped her appreciate her body once more. Tanja, who was unaware of Rebecca's good deeds, agrees to give Rebecca more time. Marlene then goes over to Rebecca's flat with ice cream and an old American movie to help her get over \\"writer's block.\\" When Rebecca finally draws inspiration from the film and redraws her collection, Marlene falls asleep on her sofa. Upon finishing her drafts, Rebecca walks over to Marlene to put a blanket over her, and is overcome with new feelings. It isn't until Dana Wolf's bachelorette spa night that the other character's are aware that Rebecca may have a crush on someone. Marlene, also in attendance at the spa party, becomes latched onto the idea of discovering who Rebecca's crush is since she won't publicly reveal it. At the time, Marlene didn't know Rebecca was also attracted to women. She only realizes it after she tries to set Rebecca up on a date with the man whom she suspects Rebecca likes (from a hint that Rebecca's muse has \\"blond hair and blue eyes\\"). Once she's aware that Rebecca is queer, she is frightened that she herself may be the blond-haired blue-eyed person to whom Rebecca is attracted. Rebecca coolly denies this after Marlene asks her, and she quickly covers it up by being seen publicly with another woman with similar features. The story then later picks up between the two when Marlena and Tristan von Lahnstein throw an after-party to their new health club's opening. A group of friends goes over to Rebecca's to celebrate, and they play a game of spin the bottle. One friend dares Marlene and Rebecca to kiss after seeing them dance together at the club premiere. After the two kiss, the camera pans to Marlene who looks at once startled and unreadable. The two had their relationship broken as a result of Marlene being unable to accept herself as a lesbian even after Marlene & Rebecca make love in a night of pure, unadulterated passion. Marlene accepts Tristan's marriage proposal, leaving Rebecca heartbroken, Rebecca is chosen to design Marlene's wedding dress and weaves the ideal design after seeing Marlene in said dress in a dream. Rebecca admits to Marlene that she loves her and that will always be the case, before completing the wedding dress. Marlene is so moved by the fact that Rebecca completed the perfect dress that she goes over to thank her on the day before the wedding and the two share a passionate kiss! On the wedding day, Rebecca is prepared to leave for Los Angeles as her love is still unrequited; however Marlene jilts Tristan at the altar and runs off to find Rebecca. Marlene finds Rebecca in the castle and after taking refuge from the Wolf's in Rebecca's room, finally admits to Rebecca that her love is reciprocated.

Be openly accessible or be obscure Harvard Fight Songs Fass fiercely Bouvie On visiting Harvard for the first time in decades, Lehrer was delighted to discover that his song had been performed at every home football game for many years. Theme The humor of \\"Fight Fiercely, Harvard\\" revolves around the supposedly refined and gentlemanly nature of Harvard athletes. As it appears on Tom Lehrer Revisited, a live album, it is preceded by banter almost as long as the song itself. In talking to his audience, Lehrer explains that he wanted to create a college fight song different from those performed, as he says with a hypercorrective use of a Latin plural for a common English word, \\"in comparable stadia.\\" This preamble also says, in part: > ...I was reminded not too long ago, upon returning from my lesson with the > Scrabble pro at the Harvard Club in Boston, of the days of my undergraduacy > long ago when there used to be these very long Saturday afternoons in the > fall with nothing to do - the library was closed - just waiting around for > the cocktail parties to begin.

And here it is, > dedicated to my own alma mater, and called Fight Fiercely, Harvard. Tom > Lehrer Revisited The lyrics are written with an exaggeratedly erudite style of diction and say in part: > Fight fiercely, Harvard! > Fight, fight, fight! > Demonstrate to them our skill. > Albeit they possess the might, > Nonetheless we have the will. The lyrics also refer to celebrating victory by inviting the \\"whole team up for tea\\" and very conscientiously warn \\"let's try not to injure them.\\" Lehrer, who is actually Jewish and from New York City, performed the song in the stereotypical Boston Brahmin accent of his on-stage persona and pronounced the words \\"fiercely\\" and \\"Harvard\\" with a non-rhotic drawl.

The company makes Unity-based games (previously Flash-based) for Internet Browsers while they also release games for Mobile. Their games are recognizable by the pixel art design and cartoon like appearance, along with a jingle to the start of every game and the use of chiptune. Nitrome was started on 10 August 2004 by Matthew Annal and Heather Stancliffe, two graphic designers, intending to create games for mobile phones. Instead, the company began taking on commissions Internet-based flash games. Some of the games of Nitrome have characters which are inspired by other characters from video games, TV shows, and others. Nitrome's games are published on their website and are often available to license on other websites such as Miniclip, MTV Arcade and Friv.  History  Nitrome's creation stemmed from a conversation between Matthew Annal and Heather Stancliffe, in which Annal suggested that they make a game for mobile phones. Stancliffe was initially hesitant, but was persuaded that it could be a successful idea. Alt URL The temporary website for their upcoming project was first launched on 3 April 2005, with a preview video of Chick Flick, their intended first game. Since then, Nitrome has made 146 flash games, their 135th game being Turn-Undead, released on 7 October 2014, and are venturing into mobile phone and PC gaming, as their current flash games aren't providing enough revenue. In September 2011, Annal was joined by his brother, Jonathan Roy Annal. On 24 November 2011 Nitrome released their 100th game, Nitrome Must Die, in which players shoot enemies from the previous 99 games that Nitrome has made before Nitrome Must Die. Their 136th game is Endless Doves.http://www.nitrome.com/blog/articles/1192/ In 2015, Nitrome made history by releasing their 140th game, Fluffball, their unreleased game from 2007, and their 141st game, Silly Sausage in Meat Land, sequel to their 2011 game, Silly Sausage. Also in 2015, their 142nd game Cooped Up, was released,http://www.nitrome.com/blog/articles/1312/ followed by Green Ninja, Vault, Beneath the Lighthouse, and ultimately, their first published game, Ultimate Briefcase, in 2016. In 2017, a teaser for the game \\"Bomb Chicken\\" was released. In 2018, it was revealed that same game would arrive on the Nintendo Switch, ultimately being a big milestone for Nitrome.  Games  The games made by the company are divided into four main categories. \\"Hearted\\" are the games that have received the most hearts from the heart button upon every game, and are thus considered the most popular. \\"All Games\\" is a list of all games produced by Nitrome, while \\"Multiplayer games\\" are designed for more than one person to play at once. Last, Touchy, released in 2012, featured games that are playable on Nitrome's mobile phone app, Nitrome Touchy. Games can be in more than one category. On 8 July 2015 Nitrome announced that Nitrome Touchy was officially discontinued. All links and services related to Touchy were taken down.http://www.nitrome.com/blog/articles/1339/ Turn-Undead was the final Touchy game, released October 2014. Nitrome has made games for MTV Arcade, PCH Games and Miniclip. Most of the games are divided into levels (usually between 10 and 100), and also give the player the option to replay any level they have completed, even if they have lost. Some games also feature the concept of bosses. In July 2009, Nitrome Limited released Twin Shot 2, their first game to use MochiCoins, a system allowing players to pay for extra content in browser games. Matthew Annal said that Nitrome were \\"trialling\\" and that they \\"don't intend to use it in every game\\". They used MochiCoins again in B.C. Bow Contest, which they have updated twice.

It was published in 1995 by Hudson Soft exclusively in Japan. The story follows an all-women police force in 2092 traveling through time to intercept terrorists committing crimes across the past and future. The player takes on the role of a police officer and controls their spaceship through waves of enemies and powerful bosses. Hudson forged a collaboration between CAProduction and Mika Akitaka to develop Sapphire. Akitaka was known for his artistic work in the Galaxy Fr√§ulein Yuna adventure game series and Gundam media franchise. Hudson saw potential in combining Akitaka's art style with a new shoot 'em up CAProduction was developing and cultivated a partnership. Sapphire was released on the Arcade CD-ROM¬≤ format due its enhanced graphical effects, and requires the \\"Arcade Card\\" RAM expansion developed by NEC to run. In retrospective coverage, Sapphire is considered one the best PC Engine shoot 'em ups. Although the gameplay was found to be average, critics concluded that the graphics and sound were of such incredible quality that they made up for any shortcomings in the game mechanics. Sapphire was produced in low numbers at the end of the PC Engine's lifespan and subsequently became a rare collector's item. The game's value soared to hundreds of dollars and lead to counterfeiting in the mid-2000s. In 2008, the game was re-released on a compilation for the PlayStation Portable released exclusively in Japan.  Gameplay  Sapphire is a 2D vertically scrolling shoot 'em up. The story takes place in 2092, when time travel is common across society. Terrorists have taken to stashing weapons and other contraband in the past, which leads to the formation of a police force (composed only of women) to counter the threat. The story follows the force in their efforts to chase one particularly elusive enemy through time. The game is split across five levels, each taking place in a different times and locations: A futuristic city, the Middle Ages, ancient Egypt and Japan, and finally outer space. The levels are remarkably short compared to the longer boss battles. Gameplay in stage one The player can pick to play as one of four women. Each has their own ship with a unique movement speed and three unique weapons. Weapons include a straight shot, wide angle shot, and a rear-facing shot, which can be powered-up by colored gems the player can pick up. When powered up, two pods fly next to the ship which can absorb enemy fire and unleash powerful shots. A limited supply of bombs are also available that deal high damage. The difficulty in Sapphire is adjustable. In addition, players can give themselves up to nine credits in the game options, and may also be granted extra lives and continues if they obtain a high score. The game supports two-player cooperative play. Development The PC Engine video game console, co-developed by NEC and Hudson Soft, was known for its quality graphical adventures and shoot 'em ups. The game was printed using the Arcade CD-ROM¬≤ format which requires the Arcade Card RAM expansion for enhanced graphics. Although shoot 'em ups were prominent in the late 1980s, popular interest shifted to fighting games in the wake of Street Fighter II's release in the early 1990s. In order to compete with the Super NES and Mega Drive, NEC developed a RAM expansion for the PC Engine called the \\"Arcade Card\\". The extra 2.25 MB of memory was large and allowed for higher quality ports of fighting games. Despite the waning popularity of shoot 'em ups, Hudson commissioned CAProduction to develop one as what would become the final Arcade Card game. CAProduction were working on a third entry in the \\"Thunder\\" trilogy following Gate of Thunder (1992) and Lords of Thunder (1993) when they were approached by Hudson. Concurrently, Hudson saw the popularity of the bish≈çjo adventure game series Galaxy Fr√§ulein Yuna and saw potential at combining the two. The Galaxy Fr√§ulein Yuna series was written and designed by Mika Akitaka, an artist known for his mecha girl designs in the Gundam media franchise. The first Galaxy Fr√§ulein Yuna game was a pure visual novel, and while the second game added action elements like dungeon crawling and turn-based card battles, Akitaka had always wanted to develop a shoot 'em up. Hudson brought Akitaka on board to work with CAProduction to develop Sapphire as an original; it was unrelated to the story in his Galaxy Fr√§ulein Yuna games. Hudson also sourced the studio J.C.Staff for animation work. The music in the game was composed and performed by the company T's Music who are a group of musicians and sound engineers. The company was founded in 1990, and they also composed the music to the games Lords of Thunder, Final Fight CD, and the Sentimental Graffiti series. The rights to the music used in the game is the property of Hudson Soft. Release Sapphire was published by Hudson and released on 24 November 1995 in Japan for the PC Engine. When it was released 32 bit consoles like the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation had already been released, and the day of release was also the day when Famicom Space World '95 conference opened, where Nintendo would show off their Nintendo 64 console. The release came late in the PC Engine's lifespan and subsequently was printed in low numbers. As a result, Sapphire became a rare collector's item, selling for high prices in the video game collecting market. E. Kozo of Hardcore Gamer said used copies were obtainable for about in 2008, not including the \\"hundreds of dollars worth of 20-year-old hardware from Japan\\" needed to play it. A prospective player needs a Japanese region PC Engine with a CD-ROM drive and an Arcade Card to play. In 2015, Eurogamer noted that copies were selling for around . The game's notorious rarity also made it a popular target for counterfeiting around 2005. Eurogamer said that the counterfeits were impressive and only identifiable under incredible scrutiny. They were convincing enough to become valued at over ¬£100 and influenced prices of original Sapphire copies. Due to its rarity and specific hardware requirements, few gamers have played Sapphire. Kurt Kalata of Hardcore Gaming 101 called it one of the \\"holy grails\\" of PC Engine collecting. On 31 July 2008, Hudson Soft released a compilation of the first two Galaxy Fr√§ulein Yuna games and Sapphire on the PlayStation Portable in Japan. The compilation is titled and was released as part of the PC Engine Best Collection series. This release adds in options to change the aspect ratios for all three games. This includes the original aspect ratio which fills half the screen, a slightly vertically stretched ratio which covers most of the screen, and a full screen mode. The collection also features an art gallery with Akitaka's concept art for the games and some original artwork. Reception and legacy Upon release, four reviewers from Famitsu gave it a 19 out of 40. They compared the game to classic shooters like Truxton and Aleste. One reviewer was shocked by the genre, expecting a girl raising sim based on the title. In retrospective coverage, both Kurt Kalata of Hardcore Gaming 101 and E. Kozo of Hardcore Gamer lauded Sapphire as one of the greatest PC Engine shoot 'em ups. Kalata described it as \\"the ultimate PC Engine shooter...a showpiece for what the system could do\\" while Kozo called it \\"one of the best shooters ever made\\". In his review, Kalata found the gameplay mediocre and non-innovative but said the strengths lied in the game's graphics and sounds. He goes on to explain that some of Sapphire's 2D sprites were pre-rendered at a high quality and animated so well that they seemed like 3D polygons. Kalata also praised the other graphical effects such as digitized holograms, morphing effects, and scaling effects. In the same vein, Kozo commended the game's parallax scrolling and lighting effects. He concluded that \\"Sapphire's style and action make up for any of its shortcomings\\". Both Kalata and Kozo praised the PlayStation Portable compilation Ginga Ojousama Densetsu Collection for giving gamers a more accessible way to play the game. Reviewing the re-release, Kozo thought the compilation had a great value since original Sapphire copies were worth ten times its price. He also praised the bonus art content but criticized the poorly implemented aspect ratio options. He felt the original aspect ratio was too small, the full screen ratio was too stretched, and felt the game was lacking a proper vertical display option. He concluded that the re-release of Sapphire was a \\"top notch example of a quality game withstanding the test of time.\\" IGN identified the game as one of the most important shooting games on the PC Engine, alongside Gate of Thunder, Lords of Thunder and Rayxanber III.

He was elected, as a Republican, to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1960 and served one term. In 1962 he ran for a Congressional seat in Ohio's 9th district which he lost to Thomas W.L. Ashley. In 1963, Ohio Governor James A. Rhodes appointed Janis Director of the Ohio Department of Mental Hygiene and Correction. He was the first layperson in the United States to hold such a position. During the course of his appointment he created the Administration on Aging in 1965 which was Ohio's first official program devoted to its elder citizens. In January 1977, Caspar Weinberger appointed Janis to the Advisory Council of the National Institute on Aging. In 1979, the Ohio Commission on Aging named the state's first multipurpose senior center after Janis. In 1981, he headed Ohio's delegation to the White House Conference on Aging, where he served as chairman of one of the fourteen workshops that comprised that conference. As Director of the Ohio Department of Aging, Janis was responsible for the creation of the \\"Golden Buckeye\\" card in 1978. The card offered discounts to senior citizens and is currently honored at over 20,000 businesses in the state of Ohio.

Modeled after Philadelphia's Independence Hall, Fire Station No. 1 served as one of the longest continuously operating fire stations in the Commonwealth of Virginia from its completion in 1907 through the opening of a replacement facility in 2007. Designed by the Lynchburg firm of Huggins and Bates, No. 1 still stands as a monument to the civic pride of early Roanoke. It is located in the Roanoke City Market Historic District. History With a purely volunteer force in place within the city beginning in 1882, the first paid firefighters were hired in 1906, and ground was officially broken for No. 1 on February 19, 1906. Completed by 1907, the station exhibits the Georgian Revival style of an Edwardian-era firehouse. It features a limestone ashlar foundation and a solid brick facade with terracotta accents, topped with a bell tower that provided views of the entire city upon its completion. By 1911 the city purchased their first engine powered fire truck stationed at No. 1. By 1918, horse-drawn fire wagons were totally phased out in favor of the engine-powered ones. Originally cast in 1886, the bell originally placed atop the structure in the bell tower was removed in 2001, restored and is now on display on the first floor of the station. By 2003, the aging facility received a facelift to repair and restore the original limestone mortar on the facade. Additionally, the former bell tower was completely restored and the station was completely operational again by December. Although officials stated that No. 1 would retain its status as a fully staffed fire station even with the completion of a replacement facility, the station stopped running fire and EMS calls on May 9, 2007. Today the facility serves as a fire museum open to the general public and as a stable for the Roanoke Police Department's Mounted Patrol.

Malkiel was born in Kiev to a Russian-Jewish family, and was brought up and educated in Berlin, after the Russian Civil War. Despite an early interest in literature, he ended up studying linguistics at the Humboldt University of Berlin, then known as the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t. Being a Jew in 1930s Germany was an obstacle to his education, but one he was able to overcome; his family finally emigrated to the United States in 1940.Dworkin, Steven. \\"Yakov Malkiel.\\" Language, Volume 80, Number 1, March 2004, pp. 153-162.

In 1943, he was offered an initially temporary position at the University of California, Berkeley, which later was converted to a permanent professorship; Malkiel remained there until his retirement in 1983, teaching in the departments of Spanish and (later) Linguistics. He married Mar√≠a Rosa Lida de Malkiel, a philologist and literary critic from Argentina, in 1948. During a period when etymology was receding from prominence in linguistics, Malkiel was both one of its chief champions and most rigorous theorists.

She has been described as having \\"a voice that's full of character, sensitive and rich\\", and as writing songs that are \\"short and sharp... stimulating and catchy\\". Early life Pronsky was born in Brooklyn, New York City and began professional vocal training at the age of eight. In 1996 she met Lucy Wainwright Roche, then a fellow high school student at Saint Ann's School. Wainwright Roche introduced her to folk music and Pronsky began to study guitar. Pronsky attended Brown University and graduated in 2002 with a degree in Ethnomusicology. However, it wasn't until she left college that she considered music to be a serious career option. Musical career Pronsky recorded several songs she had written while in college upon graduating and released this collection as her first demo Milestone in 2002. She moved back to Brooklyn soon after and began working with other musicians to explore her sound more fully. She met Rich Bennett (Friendly Bears, Monocle, Rich Bennett) in 2003 and the two began a musical collaboration. In 2005, Pronsky created the Brooklyn Songwriters Exchange, a music series presenting strong local songwriters in the New York City area. Pronsky worked with Bennett for the next few years, culminating in Departures & Arrivals (2007). Pronsky's first full-length album, it was produced by Bennett and Pronsky, and released by indie label Nine Mile Records. Pronsky spoke of the record as being \\"much more compositional\\" than her earlier work. Departures & Arrivals was followed by a limited edition EP The Best Game in Town in 2009. Nine Mile Records released Pronsky's second and third full-length albums: Viewfinder in 2011 and Only Daughter in 2013. Both records were mixed by Scott Solter. Viewfinder was recorded at the Great North Sound Society in Parsonsfield, Maine with engineer Sam Kassirer. The album explores themes of loss and coming of age, as well as the economic downturn. Track 1 \\"Hard Times\\" was featured on Song of the Day on NPR Music, on April 18, 2011, due to its topical relevance. Only Daughter is the first album solely produced by Bennett and features a dreamier, dark sound. Lyrically, the album is abstract and deals with the themes of political corruption and personal struggle. Pronsky has toured extensively in the US, UK and Europe. She has been the supporting act on shows featuring Shawn Colvin, Steve Forbert, Peter Case, Catie Curtis, Sarah Bettens, Josh Ritter, Loudon Wainwright III, Patty Larkin, and Caroline Herring among others.

Further Information: Camp Lindblad *Camp Silverado (closed) is located on Silver Lake near Kit Carson, California. The Council leases the land from the United States Forest Service. *Camp Wolfeboro is a Boy Scout summer camp located on the north fork of the Stanislaus River near Bear Valley at . The council leases the land from the United States Forest Service. Camp Wolfeboro is currently used for eight weeks each summer as an accredited BSA summer camp, hosting up to 500 Scouts per week, with a total summer attendance of more than 1,600 Scouts. The camp has traditionally relied upon its youth staff to develop and present the \\"Wolfeboro Rassle\\" quick skits at each morning's flag assembly to present the week-long theme culminating in a campwide game Thursday, with a concluding skit at the final campfire on Friday evening. Since 2005, the camp has also run an approximately six-week Fall Camp program designed for individual Scout troops and Venturing crews to use the property for rock-climbing, waterfront activities, and shooting sports. Although the waterfront is infamous for its cold mountain river water, the pristine water quality has allowed this camp to continue to offer the Snorkeling BSA Award at a time other camps have dropped the program for lack of water clarity at their locale. The Snorkeling BSA Study Guide, formerly on file at Newport Sea Base BSA and the Catalina High Adventure program, was originally designed in 1992 by waterfront staff member, J.S. Fox and his Scuba certified father, at Camp Wolfeboro and is still used at the waterfront during the summer season. The camp's fall program immediately follows the end of the regular eight-week summer season. Camp Wolfeboro was founded by the former Berkeley Council in 1928 in the area known as Hell's Kitchen, across the river from a family-oriented camp, Camp Baxter. Camp Baxter later closed down and its property was absorbed by Camp Wolfeboro, who built campsites and remodeled the Camp Baxter dining hall and medical shack into a nature lodge and hike shack. Further Information: Camp Wolfeboro Wolfeboro Pioneers right The Wolfeboro Pioneers is one of the last surviving local BSA honor societies in the United States that has not been absorbed by the Order of the Arrow, the others being Tribe of Mic-O-Say, Firecrafter, and Tribe of Tahquitz The Wolfeboro Pioneers is a Boy Scout camping honor society based out of Camp Wolfeboro near Arnold, California. The society was founded in the summer of 1929 by returning Scouts and Scouters who were devoted to creating and preserving the camp's unique tradition. An insight into the society in 1996 is given by a Scouter on the Scouts-L list.A letter to the Scouts-L list Beginning in the 1930s, the Order of the Arrow absorbed many of the small Boy Scout honor societies that had thrived during Scouting's first two decades. This happened in 1944 in Silverado Council. The Order of the Arrow established itself in Mt. Diablo Council in the early 1950s. Every summer, it inducts several adult leaders and roughly 100 Scouts, a good annual induction rate for a minor organization. These Scouts come not only from California, but from around the nation and world. Election procedures Since then, individuals have been inducted into the society through election. Eligible Scouts are nominated by the Scoutmaster and elected by their troop. The number of Scouts eligible per troop depends on the number of Scouts in the troop rounded up to the closest tenth then divided by ten (i.e. if the troop size is 30, then three Scouts are eligible, if 21 then still three Scouts are eligible). Elections are conducted in pairs by Pioneer members (usually uniformed) who disperse throughout the various campsites. The Pioneers are responsible for reading and explaining the election procedures to the assembled Scouts. The Scoutmaster has the ability to veto the troop's decision. Votes are then taken back to Pioneer Rock where they are counted by Pioneer officials. Originally only the initial returning Scouts were \\"pioneers\\" and for a number of years no one was added to their number. The society realized that if they were to survive it would be necessary to induct new members who possessed the same spirit of the original pioneers. The original procedure was that if a Scout met the requirements described above and had worked on at least one pioneer sponsored work party, then he was eligible for nomination. Prior to the final campfire of the week the pioneers would gather on pioneer rock and nominate candidates and plead their case. Upon end of discussion, a vote would be taken. To be eligible for candidacy, Scouts must have spent two weeks at Camp Wolfeboro, one of which must have been in a previous year. They must have held (or be holding) a position in their troop that is on the approved list for Eagle within the Boy Scout Handbook 11th edition, p. 446\\\\. They must also be First Class rank or above and have Scoutmaster approval before eligibility can take effect. Some troops, due to unusual size or other quality, amend these eligibility rules. For example, some troops choose to nominate only Scouts that are Star or higher. Scouters/parents must be nominated by a member of the troop they are camping with. The nomination must be seconded, and thirded by individuals present at the Thursday night Pioneer meeting. The only requirement for adults is that they have spent two weeks at Camp Wolfeboro, one of which must have been in a previous year. Unlike in the election of Scouts (excluding Venturers), females are eligible for election. Ceremony Shortly after the final dinner on Friday night, Scouts assemble at Bravo How campfire circle at the foot of Pioneer Rock. The ceremony begins with the Pioneer historian giving a short history of the camp and the organization. After that, the Pioneers, assembled on the rock, lead the Scouts seated on the logs below in singing the traditional song, \\"Patsy Ory Ory Ay.\\" When this is completed, the Pioneers slip away and form a ladder on either side of the trail leading to the main campfire circle. In a matter of minutes, the Scouts, Scouters, and parents who have come to watch the event form a column behind a number of Pioneer torchbearers who lead the way to the main campfire circle. The Pioneers lining the parade route hold their fingers in the Scout Sign and stand at rigid attention to signal the somber nature of the event and to call for observance of its importance through absolute silence. The Scouts are seated and the Pioneers disperse and retreat to the second Pioneer Rock, situated so that it overlooks the main campfire circle. The Pioneer Sergeant-at-Arms, breaking the silence, decrees in a booming voice: \\"Let The Fires Of Friendship Burn!\\" The campfires are then lit and, for the next hour, Scout troops perform songs and skits for the assembled crowd. After the skits have finished, the Calling-Out Ceremony begins. The Pioneers form a human \\"ladder\\" that runs from the stage to the top of Pioneer Rock. Each Scout is called out and is helped up the ladder to the top of Pioneer Rock. Along the way, they are congratulated by current members. After the ceremony ends, they embark on an initiation process that takes until the early hours of the morning. Duties The Wolfeboro Pioneers' official mission is to preserve and improve Camp Wolfeboro and its traditions. To this end, the Wolfeboro Pioneers assist in the opening and closing of camp each summer, as well as assisting in multiple service projects throughout most summers (in addition to the Camp Wolfeboro Workparty each Tuesday evening). Examples of the work the Pioneers have done include the maintenance of the road into camp, as well as the refurbishments of the dining hall in recent years. The Pioneers are also responsible for at least 90% of the trails within camp. A second duty of the Wolfeboro Pioneers involves the preservation of the history of Camp Wolfeboro through the creation and maintenance of the Pioneer scrapbooks, as well as the writing and printing of \\"Wolfeboro Sings\\", the official songbook. The scrapbooks are currently updated through the summer of 1998 and contain photos, clippings, and patches from the camp's history. Currently (as of June 2007) the Pioneers are actively working on updating the Camp Wolfeboro history since 2000 in the scrapbooks, as well as pursuing a new edition of \\"Wolfeboro Sings.\\" There are three Pioneer rocks. One in the center of camp, one at the main campfire circle and a third secret one. No one is permitted to walk on the rock unless they are a Pioneer. Apparel The official color of the Wolfeboro Pioneers is \\"Pioneer Blue,\\" which currently most closely resembles azure. The actual color of the Pioneers has varied considerably over the 75+ year history, ranging from teal to darker royal blue. Many pieces of Pioneer apparel have been created over the years since 1929, including t-shirts, polos, neckerchieves, and fleece jackets. As well, a large variety of patches, designed primarily for the temporary insignia location on the right breast pocket of the Boy Scout uniform, have been issued, most of which can be viewed at camp in the Pioneer scrapbooks.

Like the Van Beuren studio before, Joe Oriolo gave Felix a more domesticated and pedestrian personality, geared more toward children, and introduced Felix's now-famous elements \\"Magic Bag of Tricks\\", a satchel that can assume the shape and characteristics of anything Felix wants. The cartoons are divided into two parts, with the first part ending in a cliffhanger resolved after a commercial break. A second Felix series, The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat, aired on CBS in 1995‚Äì1997. Background In 1954, Otto Messmer retired from the Felix daily newspaper strips, and his assistant Joe Oriolo (the co-creator of Casper the Friendly Ghost) took over. Oriolo struck a deal with Felix's new owner to begin a new series of Felix cartoons for television. Oriolo starred Felix in 260 television cartoons produced by Paramount Cartoon Studios, and distributed by Trans-Lux. The show did away with Felix's previous supporting cast and introduced many new characters. These characters were performed by voice actor Jack Mercer. Oriolo's plots revolve around the unsuccessful attempts of the antagonists to steal Felix's Magic Bag, though in an unusual twist, these antagonists are occasionally depicted as Felix's friends as well. While the cartoons were a ratings success, critics have dismissed them as paling in comparison to the earlier Sullivan-Messmer works. Oriolo aimed the cartoons at children. The series used limited animation (owing to a limited budget) and simplistic storylines.Solomon 37. This TV series also helped introduce the character of Felix the Cat to audiences in Japan. A Japanese language dub of the series aired on NHK in 1960 and was rerun three years later on Fuji TV. Four decades later, Felix would be the star of his own anime series. Characters ;Felix the Cat : The main character and star of the show. He has many adventures with his secret bag of tricks that often helps in dangerous situations. Two different patterns were used for the magic bag, one is the earlier version pattern that is a dot and cross pattern. The latter series bag was a houndstooth pattern that replaced the dot and cross. All the episodes having the houndstooth pattern are missing from the market place. No matter what the situation, he almost always ends up laughing. A few of the episodes end with Felix on the losing end without the laughter, or his other signature line, \\"Righty-o!\\" ;The Professor : He is Felix's archenemy or foil and, in most appearances, is trying to seize the Magic Bag of Tricks. He has a very amusing speech impediment and is quite eccentric. He is depicted as a mad scientist, very intelligent, yet very obsessed. He attempts many tricks such as the use of his inventions and many disguises to get Felix's magic bag, but always winds up failing in the end. In some episodes where his nephew Poindexter is involved, the Professor becomes a reluctant ally of Felix, particularly when they battle the Master Cylinder. In some of the episodes, when the professor gives up on his episodic schemes, he intones with the words: \\"Oh, what's the use!!!!!\\" ; : He is the nerdy young nephew of the Professor. He is depicted as a stereotypical scientist; he is very intelligent and always wears thick Coke-bottle glasses, a lab coat, and a mortarboard. A button on the chest of his lab coat acts as a control for whatever device the plot calls for. Despite the Professor being his uncle, he is also one of Felix's best friends. Whenever he talks to Felix, he refers to him as \\"Mr. Felix\\". ;Rock Bottom : The Professor's bumbling sidekick (a bulldog who walks and dresses like a human being) who tries to help the Professor steal Felix's Magic Bag. Rock Bottom's full name is Rock Bottom Age. He occasionally works for Master Cylinder. Like the Professor, in some of the episodes, when Rock Bottom's schemes fail, he intones with the words: \\"Oh, what's the use!!!!!\\" ;Master Cylinder : An evil, cylindrical robot who first appeared in the 1960 cartoon \\"Master Cylinder-King of the Moon\\". He is always trying to kidnap Poindexter so that he can use his intellect to build weapons and equipment. It is revealed that he was once a pupil of the Professor at an academy until an explosion destroyed his original body. ;Martin the Martian : The good Martian who always helps Felix and his friends whenever they are in a space jam. ;General Clang : The evil general in space who also wants the rocket formula in order to destroy the Earth, ;Vavoom : A small, unassuming and friendly Inuit whose only vocalization is a (literally) Earth-shattering shout of his own name \\"VAVOOM!\\" (but who is powerless if his mouth was taped shut). He first appeared in \\"Felix and Vavoom\\". Theme song The program is also remembered for its distinctive theme song. It was written by Winston Sharples and performed by 1950s big band singer Ann Bennett.

This was triggered by the resignation of independent MP Rob Oakeshott who was elected to the federal seat of Lyne at a by-election the previous month. The writ for the Port Macquarie by-election was issued on 29 August, which was also when the rolls closed. Candidate nominations closed on 18 September. The by- election was contested on the same boundaries drawn for Port Macquarie at the 2007 state election. At that election, the independent MP won the seat over the Nationals by a two-party preferred margin of 78.2% to 21.8%. Background Created in a 1988 redistribution, Port Macquarie has always been based on Port Macquarie and Laurieton‚ÄìCamden Haven. It was a safe National Party seat prior to the election of Oakeshott, who was MP for Port Macquarie since 1996, becoming an independent in 2002. Candidates The following candidates nominated for the election: *Independent - James Langley, contested federal Lyne for Labor in 2007. Quit the party over protest at the Iemma state Labor electricity privatisation.Langley to contest Port Macquarie as independent: ABC News 12 August 2008 *Christian Democratic Party - Bob Waldron *Independent - Lisa Intemann (former Port Macquarie-Hastings councillor) *Greens - Susie Russell *National Party - Leslie Williams, Lake Cathie resident, contested Port Macquarie for the Nationals in 2007.

Plot summary A shape-shifting, indestructible robot‚Äîa \\"Type H-9 Ruum\\"‚Äîis accidentally left behind on earth during the age of the dinosaurs by visiting aliens, and not recovered because their ship is destroyed in a battle. The Ruum's work is collecting different species of animals within a 30-mile radius, weighing 160 pounds (give or take 15 pounds) and preserving them in a state of suspended animation for later retrieval. Many millions of years later Jim Irwin, a uranium prospector in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, encounters the Ruum's specimens, animals which include modern and prehistoric mammals and a small Stegosaurus. After he has noticed that the animals are all of a uniform size, and alive, the still-functioning Ruum appears. Shooting it with a rifle does not damage it, and when the approaching blob-shaped Ruum reveals gripping hooks and a probe dripping green liquid, Irwin runs as it pursues him at a steady five miles per hour. It is noted that Irwin weighs 149 pounds. Fit and military-trained, Irwin attempts to evade and destroy the Ruum. First he hides above his trail and drops a boulder on it, but this also fails to damage it. Then he climbs a sheer cliff, but the Ruum extrudes a climbing claw to the ledge where he is hidden. He tries to dislodge it with a stick, and finds the Ruum can generate an electric shock. He shoots it and dislodges it, but the Ruum is unharmed by the fall and responds by growing multiple claws. Having not had any time for food or sleep, Irwin eventually circles back to his camp by a lake and sets a trap with dynamite. Taking advantage of the Ruum's distraction by a grizzly bear, which it kills, he detonates the dynamite using a pistol bullet. Dazed by the explosion, he sees the Ruum still unharmed and still approaching. Exhausted and defenseless, he awaits it adding him to its collection. However, it lifts him up, then puts him back down and leaves. Soon afterward, his colleague Walt Leonard arrives by seaplane and rescues him. Safely in the plane, they make plans to bring a helicopter and collect some of the Ruum's specimens in its absence to sell to scientists. Leonard comments on Irwin's haggard appearance, guessing him to have lost 10 pounds during the chase: the reader understands that this caused his weight to become less than the Ruum's weight criterion.

The wooden markers once placed on most of the graves have long since decayed. The gravestones that remain represent only a small portion of the burials here. Starting in the middle section, the Roman Catholic parish of St. Jean Baptiste located its cemetery in the area. Acadians from the Port-Royal French soldiers and administrators along with their families were buried here. There are no original signs of this cemetery visible. When the British took the fort in 1710, they established a cemetery. This burial ground served the garrison and the Town of Annapolis Royal from 1710 until 1940.

The city had been bypassed during the advance on Baghdad, leaving the task of clearing it to American paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division with mechanized infantry and armor provided by units of the 1st Battalion, 41st Infantry Regiment, and 2-70th Armor Battalions, along with 3rd platoon 59th Chemical Company tasked with finding and removing any potential chemical or biological weapons. The battle was the largest sustained urban combat that paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne had been involved in since World War II. Before the battle As the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division advanced northwards to Baghdad, they avoided getting bogged down in urban combat by bypassing heavily defended Iraqi towns. Keeping to the south of the Euphrates River, they planned to cross the river directly south of Baghdad, in the Karbala Gap. Outside of Samawah from 22 ‚Äì 25 March, the 3rd Infantry Division made contact with Iraqi forces outside Samawah, using artillery and airstrikes. Iraqi forces attacked the American armored columns and were slaughtered. It is estimated that 120-200 Iraqis died in this action, in which no Americans were killed. The city was bypassed and did not seriously impede the 3rd Infantry Division's advance on Baghdad, but irregular forces based inside the city staged attacks on American supply lines. On 25 March, the 2nd Brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division received the order to clear Samawah and by 28 March they had re-deployed to Talil Air Base in southern Iraq. Battle The 2nd Brigade reached Samawah at 3:00 AM on 30 March, expecting to assault a trench line on the eastern outskirts of the town. Instead, they discovered a sand berm surrounding a landfill, which Bravo Battery 2/319th used as their first artillery position since no enemy forces were defending it. At dawn, the Americans began to advance towards the cement factory and received heavy small arms, mortar, and RPG fire. A sharp firefight developed between the Americans hiding behind the berms in the landfill and railroad track, and the Iraqi forces around the cement factory. An Iraqi sniper fired from the top of the factory's smokestack until an American soldier fired a TOW missile into the smokestack, collapsing the structure. Lacking smoke shells for their mortars in order to screen their movements, American forces were unable to advance and pulled back to the east. OH-58D Kiowa Warrior helicopters arrived and attacked enemy mortar and RPG teams, and destroyed several technical vehicles. At around 3:00 PM, Navy F/A-18 Hornets arrived on station and bombed a warehouse attached to the cement factory. Fighting around the cement factory died down at nightfall. That night, elements of the 3rd Battalion of the 325th Infantry Regiment launched a feint attack against the bridges in the town over the Euphrates River. The purpose was to draw the attention of Iraqi Republican Guard forces on the other side of the river, preventing them from attacking the 3rd ID's rear areas and fixing their positions so they could be destroyed by American air power. At the start of the assault, A-10 Thunderbolt II attack aircraft and 105 mm howitzers from 2/319th AFAR bombarded the north bank of the Euphrates. Raining smoke and high explosive rounds. 1st Battalion then attacked, seizing the bridges, crossing the river, and establishing a bridgehead on the north bank. Having achieved their objectives, the battalion pulled back at dawn. During this operation, an SUV attempted to run across the bridge at the Americans. After being hit with fire from a .50 caliber machine gun, the vehicle exploded into a fireball. It had been loaded with propane tanks for use as a suicide car bomb. Snipers and recon forward observers from the 82nd Airborne's 2/319 COLT team located approximately 17 armed combatants staging along the outskirts of Samawah. They radioed for artillery/mortar support and killed most of the insurgents after directing and adjusting fire unto their location (31.303165, 45.307851). At 7:00 PM on 2 April, Bco 1st Battalion of the 325th Infantry Regiment launched an attack on the cement factory with the support of an AC-130 gunship, and an M1 Abrams Tank. They took the factory unopposed. Over the next two days, 2nd Brigade cleared the rest of the city, securing the south side of the bridges, followed by an assault on the headquarters of an Iraqi paramilitary group on 4 April. Rather than taking and holding ground, the Americans launched probing attacks into the city, engaged enemy forces, and then pulled back. High explosive rounds fired by 2/319th were used against the Ba'ath Party Headquarters, a school used as a headquarters building, and a soccer field used as a rallying point. It was later said there was nothing left standing. A hospital was also being used as a headquarters by Iraqi forces, however this was not bombed due to civilians in the area. By 4 April, resistance had ceased and the city was declared cleared. 1-41 Infantry, 1st Armored Division, and the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division would be awarded a Presidential Unit Citation for their performance during combat operations.

The web-based registry contains immunization records for all children in Alaska and it allows medical professionals throughout the state to access those records. The base software was built by Scientific Technologies Corporation (STC), and is currently used under different names by over a dozen public health departments in the United States and Canada. While preliminary testing is currently underway, statewide implementation of the program is set for the fall 2008. Etymology The name VacTrAK is a syllabic abbreviation of the Vaccination Tracking System of Alaska where AK stands for Alaska. The nickname is intended to liven-up the rather drab name Alaska Immunization Information System which STC had given the product. Usage VacTrAK contains both a graphical user interface and a database which is accessible through encrypted connection via the internet. Vaccination records are stored and maintained at a central database, and physicians, nurses, and other medical personnel can view, edit, and update the records from any computer with an internet connection. As the State of Alaska issues immunization requirements for all children attending school or a licensed child care program, educational and day care administrators are able to access the records with read-only privileges in order to certify eligibility for enrollment. The primary function of the program is to enable physicians to quickly identify and administer the appropriate immunizations according to the schedules set for by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. To that end, the program will issue reminders to both the family of the child and the practicing physician to alert of upcoming vaccination appointments. Because the system is integrated statewide, it reduces the chances of over-immunization and reduces missed opportunities when children attend different physicians within a vaccination series. This promises to have a profound impact in Alaska given the state's enormous geographic diversity and rather mobile population. In each record, VacTrAK also stores contraindications, allergies, and other information which a physician will take into account when administering a vaccine. The program also keeps records and creates logs of vaccine usage, tracing any given vaccine from its arrival in Alaska to its actual administration. This is designed to prevent vaccine wastage and streamline the distribution network. The Epidemiology Section of the Division of Public Health of the Department of Health and Social Services of the State of Alaska will also have access to the registry in its entirety. This will allow epidemiologists and public nurses to analyze the data in order to better target vaccination efforts and reduce the incidents of infectious disease outbreaks. Management The Immunization Program of the Division of Public Health of the Department of Health and Social Services of the State of Alaska is responsible for implementing and maintaining VacTrAK. Funding for the registry was specifically outlined in the program's 2006 federal grant as per a Center for Disease Control requirement that all states implement centralized immunization registries in order to qualify for the federally funded Vaccines for Children program which provides approved vaccines to clinics free of charge.  Future of VacTrAK  While records for all children of Alaska are automatically permitted inclusion in the registry (unless the parents or guardians specifically opt-out), enrollment in VacTrAK is currently voluntary on behalf of the health care providers. By 2010, however, all providers will be required to enroll in and provide accurate information to VacTrAK as a prerequisite to receiving vaccines free of charge through the Vaccines for Children program.

Indications and Marketing The drug was developed by Amgen and is marketed under the trade name Nplate through a restricted usage program called NEXUS. During development and clinical trials the drug was called AMG531. Romiplostim is indicated as a potential treatment for chronic idiopathic (immune) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Romiplostim was designated an orphan drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2003, as the chronic ITP population in the USA is under 200,000 (the chronic adult ITP population in the USA is thought to be around 60,000, with women outnumbering men by a factor of two). The wholesale cost of romiplostim if administered weekly is currently estimated at US$55,250 per year. On August 22, 2008, the FDA approved romiplostim as a long-term treatment for chronic ITP in adults who have not responded to other treatments, such as corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, Rho(D) immune globulin or splenectomy. Freely available with registration. Treatment regimen Romiplostim treatment is generally administered at weekly intervals via subcutaneous injection. Prior to injection, a complete blood count (CBC) is obtained, as the dosage is dependent on the individual's body weight and platelet count at the time of treatment. The goal of treatment is to maintain the count above 50,000 per cubic millimeter (mm3) of blood, not to achieve a normal count--defined as 150,000-450,000 per mm3 in most healthy individuals. If a count of 200,000 or higher is achieved for two consecutive weeks a reduced dose is administered or treatment is suspended until the count decreases below 200,000. Discontinuation of romiplostim must be approached with great caution, as a rapid decrease in the platelet count may occur, possibly leading to bleeding diathesis. Clinical efficacy In well designed, 24-week, Phase III trials, romiplostim was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving the primary endpoint of a protocol-defined durable platelet response in nonsplenectomized or splenectomized adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Side-effects Romiplostim's effect is to stimulate the patient's megakaryocytes to produce platelets at a more rapid than normal rate, thus overwhelming the immune system's ability to destroy them. As doing so involves changes to the bone marrow chemistry, a number of potentially serious side-effects may develop, including death, myalgia, joint and extremity discomfort, insomnia, thrombocytosis, which may lead to potentially fatal clots, and bone marrow fibrosis, the latter of which may result in an unsafe decrease in the red blood count.

It has been designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Architecture Completed in 1908, the three-story, 42-room mansion was designed by Frederick Louis Roehrig. Roehrig also planned the landscape gardens and layout of the grounds. The mansion is located on a site that also includes a formal garden and carriage house with chauffeur's quarters. When the house was completed, the Los Angeles Times published a full-page article accompanied by numerous photographs. The Times called it \\"among the finest homes in Los Angeles\\" and one of architect Roehrig's \\"best efforts.\\" The Times described the exterior of the mansion as follows: > The house is distinctly of the typical English domestic architecture. The > exterior is of stone and half timber and plaster finish, while the roof is > of slate. It is probably the finest example of the purely English type of > dwelling in this city. The Times also made note of the grand staircase describing it as \\"the stair builder's art in mahogany\\" lit by a large group of art glass windows. The third floor was almost entirely taken up by a by ballroom with a large brick fireplace and an open truss and exposed beam ceilings. History The house was built for a wealthy lumberman, William E. Ramsay, who died in 1909‚Äîshortly after the mansion was completed. His widow continued to live in the mansion until her death in 1916. In 1913 the house was featured across six pages in Homes and Gardens of the Pacific Coast Volume II, a picture book of Los Angeles mansions describing it as a \\"beautiful home of the English style of domestic architecture, designed by Mr. F. L. Roehrig ...\\" Estate in 1913 showing the house and entry drive In the early 1920s, the property was purchased for the unheard of price of $105,000 by William G. and Nellie McGaughey Durfee. Mr. Durfee was a horse-racing devotee, and Mrs. Durfee was the sheltered daughter of a Figueroa Street millionaire. Their marriage had been a scandal reported on in the newspapers, as Mr. Durfee had divorced the mother of his two children in 1910 and married Nellie in 1911. During the 1920s, the house was a gathering place for the motion picture business, and its grand staircase and ornately paneled rooms were popular filming locations. Mr. Durfee died in 1927, reportedly from food poisoning while on a fishing trip in the Pacific Northwest. Nellie remained at the house until her death in 1976, reportedly living as a recluse. Columnist Jack Smith toured the Durfee residence in 1976 and found the house virtually unchanged from the time of Mr. Durfee's death 50 years earlier. Though Mr. Durfee had died during Prohibition, the wine cellar remained untouched and full of vintage wines dating to the 1890s and 1900s as well as 183 bottles of vintage whisky. Mr. Durfee's wide-brimmed felt hats and tweed suits were still hanging in his closet. Smith noted that Mrs. Durfee died at age 99, \\"wasted and blind,\\" in an upstairs bedroom -- \\"alone with her companion-housekeeper, her cat, her ostrich feathers, her unopened boxes of silk stockings, her sculptures and paintings and Oriental rugs.\\" In 1978, the Brothers of St. John of God bought the property from the Estate of Nellie Durfee for $470,000. The purchaser was a Roman Catholic religious order that operated 260 hospitals which purchased the property to serve as its western headquarters. In 1982, the house was opened to the public for the first time in its history for a benefit dinner to support KUSC radio. Historic designation In 1980 city's Cultural Heritage Commission designated the property, under the name \\"Villa Maria\\", as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, calling it, \\"a distinguished example of Tudor Revival architecture of the early 20th Century.\\" It was also listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.

At 44 lbs troy (16.4 kg), it is substantially larger than the Fricot \\"Nugget\\" (13.8 lb troy; 5.15 kg) and the Whopper (11.7 lb troy; 4.37 kg), the next two largest specimens. History Gold found in California is often in quartz, which is typically a hard rock, mined in vertical or horizontal shafts. This contrasts with placer (loose gold, often nuggets) and fine gold that has been recovered by hydraulic mining. The gold specimen was unearthed at the Sonora Mining Corporation mine in Jamestown, California on December 24, 1992. Along with other gold-heavy quartz pieces, the gold was first believed to be bits of damaged machinery. A number of days later, the materials were examined and found to be full of gold. The ‚ÄúCrown Jewel‚Äù was the largest of the pieces, weighing in at 60 lb troy (22.4 kg). The finding of the gold was reported by The National Enquirer. The find caused the Gold Trust and Reinsurance company of the West Indies to make a $20 million offer for the Sonora Mining Corporation of Toronto, Canada. The French government also offered to buy the specimen. In April 1993, Sonora Mining offered the gold specimen as a bond to Tuolumne County, California. The county ultimately declined the offer. Many of the smaller specimens of crystalline gold were sold at a Tucson, Arizona gem show. Display John Kautz, proprietor of Ironstone Vineyards, purchased the gold specimen in 1994 for an undisclosed price; its appraised value at the time was $3.5 million. Kautz had the 60 lb troy (22.4 kg) nugget etched with acid to remove most of the quartz; the resulting gold leaf specimen is 44 lbs troy (16.4 kg). A small piece of the original rock was left in the back to show the original matrix. Kautz opened a museum devoted to the history of gold mining in the area, to display the gold specimen. The museum is in the same building that houses his jewelry store also opened by Kautz. California Governor George Deukmejian opened the Ironside's Crown Jewel exhibit. Name The name \\"Ironstone's Crown Jewel\\" comes from Kautz family's usage and promotional materials for the winery. It is the crown jewel among the historic items at the vineyard and museum.

His work is preserved in the Can√ßoner Vega-Aguil√≥ (1420-30). He was probably active in the early years (1416-21) of the reign of Alfonso V. His religious title, fra (\\"brother\\"), has led to speculation that he was a knight of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem (based on an unsourced assertion of Jordi Rubi√≥). Johan preached at Cervera during Lent in 1424. It is recorded that he was a member of the \\"Order of Santa Anna\\". This is probably a reference to the convent of Santa Anna at Barcelona, which was originally a house of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre under the guidance of the Patriarch of Jerusalem. Cohabitating at Santa Anna was a group of Brothers of Penitence and some Augustinian canons of Santa Eul√†lia del Camp (since 1293). In 1420 the friars and canons passed into the Casa del Sant Sepulcre de Santa Anna.R. Mir√≥ i Baldrich (1995), \\"Predicar la Quaresma a Cervera als Segles XV i XVI\\", Estudis de llengua i literatura catalanes, XXX: Miscel¬∑l√†nia Germ√† Col√≥n, 3 (Montserrat: Publicacions de l'Abadia de Montserrat), 94-95. Johan was a competent and original poet; his poetry diverse in form and style, his themes both religious and amorous. Besides his religious and amorous poetry, Basset wrote three unique pieces: a planh, a piece entitled Vers lauda, and another called Vers clus. Basset's Letovari (electuarium) is a manual for curing the love-sick, dedicated to Guerau de Massanet. It has much in common with the Consolaci√≥ of Luys Ycart and the Medicina of Bernat Metge.*Mart√≠n de Riquer (1964), Hist√≤ria de la Literatura Catalana, vol. 1 (Barcelona: Edicions Ariel), 635-41, provides a poem-by-poem overview of Basset's literary achievement. Johan's religious verse consists in four poems about the Virgin Mary. His Dansa de Nostra Dona was his first published work: it was edited by Manuel Mil√† i Fontanals and published in his Obras completas (1886-93). Its incipit is Ab letres d'aur per mesura and it was addressed to an anonymous lady de Sant Climent (from Sant Climent de Ta√ºll). A similarly titled piece, the Dansa e laors de Nostra Dona, has the form of a typical love song (can√ß√≥); only its title betrays its religious purpose. It incipit is Lausan vostra saviesa. Johan's Dir me cov√© si be.m tench l'engeny fflach and Mayres de Dieu, valerosa princesa are also addressed to Mary. In the latter, each stanza begins with a line introducing the Mayres de Dieu followed by six lines beginning e cert molt val (\\"is certainly more worthy\\") and ending with the refrain e res no val tant com la vostra cort (\\"and nothing is worth as much as your court\\"). The structure of this piece and its contents suggest it is a religious plazer, a genre introduced to Catalonia by Cerver√≠ de Girona over a century earlier and Catalanised by Pere March within Johan's lifetime. Johan's love poetry fits within the tradition of courtly love and of the troubadours. This is obvious when he refers to himself as a \\"prisoner\\" of his lady and in his use of feudal and military terminology to describe their relationship.

The Head of School is Dr. John \\"Jack\\" Creeden, who joined Whitby in July 2019. The school was founded by Nancy McCormick Rambusch, who founded the American Montessori Society (AMS) in 1960.University of Connecticut Archives & Special Collections: The History of AMS, https://lib.uconn.edu/libraries/asc/collections/amsrecords/the-history-of- ams/#, last accessed 23 Oct 2018. The founding of Whitby School is credited with initiating a Montessori revival. The school was named after Whitby Abbey in Yorkshire, England, where a traditional story tells of an abbess who recognized the musical talents of a stable boy and brought him into their educational program. In 1960, the school moved from rented rooms at Sacred Heart School to its own campus. The school, through the AMS, became the first certified Montessori teacher training program in the United States. Rambusch and the AMS promoted a modified Montessori approach that would facilitate transition of the young students to traditional American schools which led to a split from the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI). In 1962, Whitby's first two graduates entered high school. The first graduates then entered college in 1965. In 1975, a toddler class, \\"Stepping Stones\\", was created to serve children between two and three years of age. By 1982, Stepping Stones was accepting children at eighteen months of age. In 1994, the Junior High Division was reconfigured into the present Middle School. In 2010, Whitby adopted the International Baccalaureate's Primary Years Programme and Middle Years Programme, thus becoming the only school in the United States to be triple-accredited at the time. In Fall of 2016, Whitby School was approved to acquire an additional five acres of land. This added acreage expanded the school's campus to a total of 30.3 acres, allowing for an additional 16,000 square feet of building space, providing the school with flexibility for further development. In July 2019, Whitby Board of Trustee named Dr. Jack Creeden as the new Interim Head of School. In January 2020, Dr. Creeden agreed to extend the length of his contract and was named Head of School.  Facilities  Whitby School stands on 30 acres of land and its buildings have evolved over the years. In 2013, the school built a four-classroom addition, which provided two classrooms for third and fourth grade, as well as a state- of-the-art design room and science room. This was followed by the construction of a new 11,860 square foot Athletics Center that took place between March 2015 and May 2016 and doubled the size of its predecessor. In 2016, the school added a Makerspace to its library, expanding on the philosophy that the library is a hub for all shared resources and not just books. The Makerspace includes a variety of tools and supplies for students to create items for class or independently. The school worked with Brooklyn's Situ Studio on the project. Whitby was certified in May 2019 as \\"School Yard Habitat\\" that allows for curriculum enhancements and exploration outside the classroom. The habitat is also open to the public.  Student Life  Whitby School is divided into three levels , which makes up the N-8 educational curriculum: Children's House (18 months-Kindergarten), Lower School (Grades 1-4), and Middle School (Grades 5-8). The school has a capacity for 450 students. Whitby currently enrolls 300 students and employs 87 full-time faculty.  Children's House  Whitby's Children's House is divided into Stepping Stones and Primary levels, which are divided into multiage classrooms. Here, the curriculum is based on a Montessori method for teaching. Three teachers are assigned to each classroom, allowing for individualized attention. The multiage nature of the classroom promotes students to learn from their peers, and for older students to build confidence and leadership skills.  Lower School  Lower School is the second level at Whitby School and encompasses Grades 1-4. While Grades 1 and 2 remain in a multiage setting, Grades 3 and 4 are divided into separate classrooms. Through Whitby's International Baccalaureate curriculum, the school emphasizes conceptual based transdisciplinary learning. Teachers work to create learning experiences that require using skills from multiple school topics. The end of Lower School is marked by Grade 4 Exhibition. For this assignment, students must pick a topic of their choice to research, consult experts and present to faculty, staff, parents, and fellow students.  Middle School  Spanning Grades 5-8, the Middle School is the third and final school level at Whitby. Fifth grade also marks the beginning of the IB Middle Years Programme, which continues the emphasis of making real world connections with in-class subject matter. At Whitby, this is also the start of subject specific classes. There is also the opportunity for interdisciplinary units in the Upper School, or when the learning from two different classes supports a single idea or subject. At the end of Middle School, students participate in 8th Grade Project, a student-led project designed to extend their knowledge and develop their skills.  Community Service  A community centered mindset is instilled at Whitby at an early age. Beginning with Primary, students are introduced to the school's Buddy Program. Here, fifth grade students are paired with their younger counterparts as they first get to know each other and then work on community service projects. As the students enter 6th grade, they start performing community service at outside organizations. Community service for Whitby students culminates with the 7th and 8th grade service trip to a Spanish speaking country. Using the Spanish skills they've learned throughout the school's continuum, the students work with local partner organizations in the country they are visiting. In 2017-2019, the students worked with the Mariposa Foundation in the Dominican Republic.  Cocurricular Program  Whitby has an expansive program of classes that extend the academic day. They range from sports to enrichment programs. Students are given the opportunity to choose what cocurricular activity they'd like to participate in, such as chess, music instruction, Chinese, and Mathcounts.  Sports  Whitby is a member of the Middle School Fairchester Association and competes with local schools over three seasons. The school offers soccer and cross country during the fall, basketball in the winter, and baseball, softball, tennis and cross country in the spring.  Visual and Performing Arts  The school also offers a robust Performing Arts program for Middle School students, which leads to at least one production a year. While theater students rehearse for the production, a second group of students work in another cocurricular class called Art Installation, to design and create the production's set.  Secondary School Placement  At the beginning of seventh grade, students begin meeting with Whitby's dedicated secondary school placement team to find best fit secondary schools. Schools Whitby students have gone on to include Choate Rosemary Hall, Phillips Andover, and Phillips Exeter.
