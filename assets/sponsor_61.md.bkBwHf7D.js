The designs are divided into four distinct groups; three of these are on the center and ends of the rock shelter's wall, while the fourth is on a joint block of sandstone within the shelter. Most of the designs were created during the Late Woodland and Mississippian periods, which spanned from 450 to 1550 A.D.; a number of the figures were added after 1550. A tall spear- holding anthropomorph in the western group is the largest individual petroglyph in Illinois. In addition to anthropomorphs, other common designs at the site include zoomorphs, quadrupeds which probably represent deer, and symbols; the quadrupeds and anthropomorphs are frequently depicted in motion. The rock shelter was likely used as a religious site by prehistoric inhabitants, and several of the designs appear to have mystical or spiritual significance; for instance, the winged anthropomorphs likely represent shamans.Wagner, Mark J.

The 78th Battleaxe Division, of the British Eighth Army, was engaged in fierce fighting around the town of Centuripe in the central portion of Sicily in the hill country between the Rivers Ditta√¨no and Salso. Centuripe, a hill town set on a very high rocky pinnacle and approached by only one steep and twisty road, itself was the key to the whole Adrano position, the capture of which would in turn force the Germans to withdraw to new positions.Alexander, p.1021. The British troops captured the town after heavy fighting and as a result caused the Germans to start contemplating abandoning Sicily altogether.Facaros & Pauls, p.225. Background Allied movements on Sicily during the month of July. The key position in the German defense line across Sicily was Centuripe, a village perched on the top of a formidable line of steep hills along with its precipitous sides which gave it an almost impregnable position. The lesser hills round it were well defended by the Germans and it was necessary for them to be mastered before Centuripe could be tackled. Defending this position was the crack Hermann G√∂ring Division, consisting mostly of the 3rd Fallschirmj√§ger Regiment as part of Kampfgruppe von Carnap under Ludwig Heilmann. As well as the regiment, the kampfgruppe consisted of an artillery regiment and a number of reconnaissance units which included a number of tanks with supporting infantry units. Heilmann had replaced the commander Oberstleutenant Von Carnap after he had been killed by British artillery fire in late July.Mitchum, p.256.Kurowski, p.254. The 78th Battleaxe Infantry Division, under the command of Major-General Vyvyan Evelegh, assembled for a drive towards Catenanuova and to capture Centuripe as part of Operation Hardgate.Chant, pp. 77-78. The country between the two villages was wild and rough with great rocky crags, similar to those among which the 78th had fought in the campaign in Tunisia, and this terrain covered the one mountain road between them.Ford, pp.68-70. Evelegh ordered Brigadier Nelson Russell, commander of the 38th (Irish) Infantry Brigade, to take Centuripe, and the plan was for a night advance to be made with heavy artillery fire available at call. The 6th Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and the 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Fusiliers were given the main tasks, and the 2nd Battalion, London Irish Rifles were ordered to make a dangerous flanking manoeuvre.Doherty, p.116. On the evening of August 1 the London Irish moved to a lying-up area in the wadis below the foothills of Centuripe. No transport was able to get forward and that meant that all ammunition, food, and other supplies had to be man-handled causing a delay. Battle At noon next day the London Irish went forward to a line behind the 6th Battalion, Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment, of 36th Infantry Brigade, who were fighting in the hills behind Centuripe, and in the August heat they could see the village resting on the summit of the large hill. The job of the London Irish was to take three commanding hills, Points 704, 611, and 703 behind Centuripe but it was not known in what strength they were held by the Germans. It was hoped that most of German attention would be to the main battle and that they would concentrate on this rather than their rear. A Panzer III tank knocked out during the fierce street fighting in Centuripe The London Irish G and F Companies crossed the start-lines after a fifteen-minute warm-up by the 25-pounders, and they were soon on Points 704 and when G Company overwhelmed the position, H Company moved on to take Point 703. On the start-line they had some casualties as they had to face machine-guns from the hill and from the sides; G Company helped in silencing the enfilade fire, and when darkness came the London Irish consolidated on the ground gained. The third hill however still held out and the decision had to be made whether to wait until it had fallen, or to carry on without delay and rely on the preoccupation of the Germans with the left-flank attack. The latter course was taken; the Royal Irish Fusiliers put in their assault towards the north and rear of Centuripe, and the Inniskillings, who throughout had been in close contact with the Germans on the frontal sector, obtained a foothold on the southern edge of the village after a heavy barrage, which included scaling a 100-foot cliff. The Royal Irish Fusiliers pushed through the northern end of the town, fighting was stubborn and hard; two German Panzer MKIII's created the most problems; there were no British tanks up in support and these were knocked out eventually by PIAT weapons. The Irish brigade then had the difficult task of house to house fighting which proved difficult against the tough paratroopers, by the evening it was thought the town was cleared but the Germans counterattacked and although it was largely repelled some units sneaked back in to snipe as the Irish cleared the streets and houses. Throughout the night more men from 38th Brigade moved into the town to reinforce those already there. Finally the Germans launched another counterattack but this time it was weak and easily repelled after which resistance began to fade. Just before dawn on August 3 the whole of the environs including Centuripe fell to the Irish Brigade. The operation had been a tough one, in difficult country and chief credit for the success was due to the Inniskillings, who bore the brunt of the fighting. In August 1943, there was no respite after Centuripe had been captured and the Irish Fusiliers mastered heights beyond the village, and the London Irish, marching through Centuripe, reached rising ground overlooking the River Salso. The transport had difficulty in getting down the winding road from Centuripe because of a large crater which took the sappers twelve hours to fill in and also because the Germans in their retreat scattered mortar bombs and shells in the area. Aftermath British troops in Centuripe. The successful capture of Centuripe had caused the whole German line to Catania to crack and thus had to withdraw to a new position: the Etna line. This however had to be abandoned and soon plans were made to abandon the island of Sicily as a whole. The London Irish quickly reached high ground on the far side of the Salso, and at night 'E' and 'F' Companies got to the Simeto. As dusk approached, two platoons of 'G' Company moved across the river with reserve ammunition, mortars, and machine-guns for the immediate support of the two other companies. By darkness the bridgehead was secure and the Germans withdrew during the night so that in the morning a fighting patrol from the London Irish located the Germans half-way up the hills on top of which was the next objective, the much-bombed town of Aderno. That, however, was not an Irish Brigade task, for the two other brigades (11th and 36th) of the 78th Division went through. From the afternoon of August 1 to nightfall on August 5 the Irish Brigade had advanced twenty-five miles fighting battles at Centuripe, Salso, and the Simeto. The battalion spent five days resting in the cool waters of the Simeto, by which time the rest of the division had captured Aderno and Bronte, and were holding the hills on the far side of the latter town. The crossing of the Salso and Simeto Rivers and the fall of Aderno had cut all the German lateral communications west and south of Mount Etna, and caused the fall of Paterno, Santa Maria, and Biancavilla. The 1st Royal Irish Fusiliers, in the meantime, had captured Capella and Monte Maletto and cleared the village. The fall of Maletto and the subsequent rapid approach to Randazzo forced the Germans on their last hurried withdrawal to the sea. News of the capture of Centuripe was met with great enthusiasm, General Bernard Montgomery, the British Eighth Army commander, when shown the cliffs of the town after its capture shouted impossible!. The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill mentioned the news of the capture in the House of Commons only a few days later, citing the capture as one of the greatest achievements in storming.

She taught, among others, the First Adzom Drukpa, Drodul Pawo Dorje. Sera Khandro was born into a rich family, but ran away at the age of 14 to escape an unwanted engagement and to follow the Vajrayana teacher Drime Ozer, who was then in Lhasa on pilgrimage from Golok in Eastern TIbet. She returned with him and his followers to Golok, where she lived in poverty; there she became life partners with Garra Gyelse. Garra Gyelsel disliked her terma revelations, and this caused Sera Khandro to become sick. Her health returned when she went back to Drime Ozer with whom she subsequently revealed the treasure scriptures, or terma, for which she is known. From when she was young she had experienced visions of Vajravarahi and exhibited many confirming indications of being a treasure revealer, a terton. This meant that she was destined to reveal treasure scriptures, or terma, said to have been concealed by the eighth-century Indian mystic Padmasambhava and his consort Yeshe Tsogyal. She was a teacher to many leading Nyingma lamas, including Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje and Chatral Sangye Dorje. She is considered an emanation of Yeshe Tsogyal. In Sarah H. Jacoby's Love and Liberation: Autobiographical Writings of the Tibetan Buddhist Visionary Sera Khandro (New York: Columbia University Press, 2014), the author wrote Khandro was \\"one of the few Tibetan women to record the story of her life.\\" Khandro also wrote the biography of her guru, Drim√© √ñzer, son of the terton Dudjom Lingpa.

The book presents a chronological history of censorship from Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome and the Middle Ages to the present. It discusses notable censored works, including Ulysses by James Joyce, Lady Chatterley's Lover by D. H. Lawrence and the seven dirty words monologue by comedian George Carlin. Heins discusses censorship aimed at youth in the United States through legislation including the Children's Internet Protection Act and the Communications Decency Act. The author explores the question of whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to media deemed inappropriate by adults (including violence and pornography), arguing that youths are not endangered by sexually explicit material. Heins asserts that there is no simple tactic by which the government can censor material from children without violating rights guaranteed to adults by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She points out that although the view of sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven, the fear of its impact is used to support morality-based arguments; appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually has the unintended consequence of harming them. Not in Front of the Children received the Eli M. Oboler Award in 2002 from the American Library Association as the \\"Best Published Work on Intellectual Freedom\\". Booklist recommended it as a starting point for discussion between adolescents and adults. Library Journal recommended the book for academic and public libraries as a detailed history of censorship related to obscenity. Publishers Weekly called the book a significant work in the fields of child psychology and civil liberties. In Florida, the St. Petersburg Times praised the book as an engaging look at attempts to prevent adolescents from thinking about sexuality. The American Prospect criticized Heins' presentation style, calling the book boring. Background Marjorie Heins at an event for the National Coalition Against Censorship in 2009 Author Marjorie Heins, an attorney with a focus on civil liberties, received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Cornell University in 1967. She graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, receiving a juris doctor degree in 1978. At the time of the book's publication, Heins was director of the Free Expression Policy Project at the National Coalition Against Censorship. Her prior published books include Strictly Ghetto Property: The Story of Los Siete de la Raza (1972), Cutting the Mustard: Affirmative Action and the Nature of Excellence (1987) and Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy: A Guide to America's Censorship Wars (1993). After Not in Front of the Children was published, Heins wrote Priests of Our Democracy: The Supreme Court, Academic Freedom, and the Anti-Communist Purge (which received the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award) in 2013. Before publication the book's working title was Not in Front of the Children: \\"Indecency\\" in History, Politics, and Law, and it was first published in 2001 by Hill & Wang. Heins' original book included about 300 pages of material, with an additional-notes section over 100 pages long. A paperback edition from the same publisher was released in 2002, and Rutgers University Press published paperback and e-book editions in 2007. The 2007 paperback edition included a new introduction to the book by Heins. A European edition was published in 2008. Heins dedicated the book to her Harvard Law School professor Benjamin Kaplan. Content summary Not in Front of the Children places George Carlin's seven dirty words monologue within the context of censorship history. Not in Front of the Children is a history of censorship from Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome and the Middle Ages to the present. Heins examines the Comstock laws, promulgated by Anthony Comstock in 1873, which criminalized the mailing of writings deemed immoral. Examples of censored works include James Joyce's Ulysses, D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover and comedian George Carlin's seven dirty words monologue. The author discusses the Meese Report, by the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography. The report acquired its colloquial name because the panel was selected by U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese. Released in 1986, the report decried pornography's alleged harm to women and children. Contemporary censorship issues detailed in the book include Howard Stern and the Columbine High School massacre, and the author critiques A Return to Modesty: Discovering the Lost Virtue by Wendy Shalit and Mothers Organized for Moral Stability (MOMS). The author discusses censorship aimed at youth in U.S. legislation including the Children's Internet Protection Act and Communications Decency Act. Heins examines the question of whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material. She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is based on the idea that minors are innocent and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them, explaining how this belief has been used as a basis for censorship. Heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view. U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas wrote a dissenting opinion in Ginsberg v. New York. The author believes that determinations of what should be censored from whom should not be made by the government, stressing that a society must ensure that there is a tangible negative impact on youth from certain material before imposing censorship. She writes that it becomes incredibly difficult to characterize specifically what should and should not be censored, resulting in negative overreaching consequences of censorship. Heins advises the impact on society from censorship could be so great that censors should be sure there is real actual harm rather than imagined harm prior to enacting restrictive laws regulating indecency or the Internet. Not in Front of the Children explores the development of U.S. case law with different standards of censorship for children and adults. The author describes a 1968 Supreme Court of the United States case, Ginsberg v. New York, where the court upheld a law preventing minors from viewing sexually explicit media. Sam Ginsberg and his wife managed a diner in Bellmore, New York. A mother sent her 16-year-old son to buy two adult magazines at the diner, creating a situation where Ginsberg would be prosecuted. Ginsberg was convicted of violating a New York State law which forbade selling magazines with pictures of nude women to minors. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Ginsberg's conviction, ruling that the New York State Legislature was not required to prove a tangible negative impact on youth from exposure to sexually explicit material. The Court said the New York State Legislature only needed to assume that such an impact existed. Justice William O. Douglas wrote a dissenting opinion in the case, criticizing the New York law. He concluded he knew individuals who fit the definition of juvenile delinquent but were fifty years old, and extrapolated the impact of the decision could be expanded to affect adults and multiple organizations in society instead of just youths. Heins demonstrates how lawmakers in other states used the Ginsberg v. New York ruling to increase morality-based censorship of material from children. A year after the ruling, an Ohio court determined that Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was inappropriate for youth. The author explains the dangers in allowing the government to determine appropriate material for youth to view, pointing out that the belief in sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven. Heins notes that the fear of this impact is used to support morality-based arguments, and appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually harms them through the censorship itself. Themes Scholars have discussed Not in Front of the Children in academic journal articles, and characterized it as a work which balances education policy against the negative consequences of censorship. In an article for Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, Middlebury College women's studies professor Deborah Grant compared the book to Harmful to Minors by Judith Levine. Grant characterized both books as significant works emphasizing the importance of allowing youths access to informative educational resources. She classed Heins' monograph as a thorough and important survey of the chronology of censorship. Perry L. Glanzer wrote in English Journal that Heins had a valid viewpoint to engage students on controversial topics in literature classes, and he added it was necessary to teach them all perspectives of a debate. Ellen P. Goodman wrote for Berkeley Technology Law Journal that Heins was critical of prior articles which attempted to show negative impact from violence as portrayed on television programs. Writing in the journal Social Problems, Jessica Fields characterized Not in Front of the Children as a significant monograph which effectively criticized the rhetoric of protection of the sexual purity of youths as a form of ideology. Cynthia A. McDaniel wrote in a piece for the journal Counterpoints assessing that Heins had put forth a thesis that attempting to shield youths from events led to negative unintended consequences. McDaniel emphasized that rationale debate is key to a functional society which values freedom of choice. She wrote that debate and introspection were critical to growth in this area, in order to determine the need to modify behavior patterns. Journal The Library Quarterly published an article by Eliza T. Dresang which classed Not in Front of the Children as an effective treatise on the harmful to minors doctrine. Dresang wrote that Heins had successfully shown that this doctrine, which served as the core basis for legislation including the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), was demonstrably impossible to prove. She concluded that Heins concisely argued censorship of works from the reach of children can have negative impacts on their level of innovation, healthy mental growth, and adaptive abilities. Writing in English Journal, Tonya Perry discussed the work and emphasized that if the motivation behind children's education was to produce independent critical thinkers, it was necessary to extend the limits of censorship. David Darts discussed Not in Front of the Children in an article for Studies in Art Education, and wrote that queries over artistic value as balanced against a desire to protect attendees of educational institutions from perceived harm repeatedly came up over time in the history of censorship. He observed that the rationale for justifying censorship of artwork from children was based upon similar reasons dating back from Plato to contemporary times, namely anxiety that youth would become corrupted by viewing products deemed inappropriate. Reception Not in Front of the Children received the 2002 Eli M. Oboler Award from the American Library Association. It was recognized as the \\"best published work\\" on the subject of intellectual freedom. Booklist called it an in-depth analysis of a hotly debated topic. Analyzing the book's appropriateness for young adults, Booklist concluded there was a great deal in the work to stimulate discussion between adults and adolescents. Publishers Weekly reviewed the book favorably, and questioned whether Edward Lear would have been surprised to find his 1998 poem \\"The Owl and the Pussycat\\" had been censored from school library computer access due to online filters restricting users from reading anything containing the word \\"pussy\\". The review wrote that the Heins powerfully argued that the notion of safeguarding youths from potential corruption had gone too far in the United States. Publishers Weekly concluded the author's thesis was a key work within the fields of both child psychology and civil liberties. In its review, the Library Journal said the work by Heins reflected a thorough investigation of the subject matter and presented a good overview of the chronology of censorship. The review concluded the author's thesis that censorship under the guise of helping children caused more harm than good was a sound one. Library Journal recommended the book both for academic libraries as well as public libraries, and called a lecture by the author on her book \\"a must\\". School Library Journal wrote that the book was timely due to the fact that there were significant issues of censorship being reported. School Library Journal praised Heins for her high level of studious effort preparing the work, and recommended it for all those involved in issues surrounding freedom of expression. The journal said academia had been waiting for such a valuable resource for a significant period of time. The review concluded it was quite impressive that Heins kept to an objective viewpoint throughout discussions of censorship in her monograph. The St. Petersburg Times called the book an in- depth analysis of American anxiety over restricting sexual feelings of children. The Hollywood Reporter noted that Heins made an important distinction in arguing that taboo topics should be taught to children by their parents, and it should not be the role of government to censor what material individuals are allowed to view (or speak). The Atlanta Journal-Constitution recommended Heins' study for summer nonfiction reading in its \\"Family Matters\\" section. In The New York Times, journalist Michael Massing felt that the author's view on contemporary free-speech issues (her stance on limiting censorship, and her view that little television programming could cause harm to children) was extreme. The American Prospect criticized the author's presentation style, acknowledging Heins was a skilled attorney on the subject of civil liberties, but called the book itself boring. The review compared the author's writing style to comic books, and concluded Heins' chronology of litigation regarding profane speech came across as less than a neutral presentation.

Her work has been recognized with membership in the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana and various awards. Life Morales‚Äô interest in art began when she was young. When she was thirteen, her uncle took her to an art exhibition at the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana, telling her that it was where the greats exhibited. She said that at that moment, she wanted to be a member. However, her family allowed her only to study business briefly before she married. The artist states that her struggle ‚Äúagainst the world‚Äù continued after her marriage because her husband was also traditional, like her father. However, she managed to study theology and even painting, paying for classes she said were for the couple‚Äôs three children but really for herself. Eventually in 1989, she was able to do some professional level studies with watercolorist Gustavo Alaniz for two years, drawing landscapes in charcoal and then worked in pastels. Later teachers have included Robin Bond, Jos√© Hern√°ndez Delgadillo and Laura Elenes. Morales was able to establish a successful art career, even earning enough to help support her family and her husband, who was ill. However, the marriage ended after 28 years. (hallan) After the divorce she did graduate study in ‚Äúhealing art‚Äù led by psychologist Patricia Crast. The study resulted in an exhibition called ‚ÄúOcho conjuros para sanar el alma‚Äù a collection of handmade dresses to represent difficulties in her life. The collection has since been displayed in Mexico City, Costa Rica, New York and several places in Europe.(hallan) Today, Morales live in the Lomas de Occipaco neighborhood of Naucalpan, State of Mexico . Career Morales has exhibited in various parts of Mexico as well as abroad. Notable exhibitions include, \\"Le Couleur du Mexique\\", Paris, 2002; \\"¬øQui√©n es el que anda aqu√≠?\\", Chicago, 1999, and \\"Ocho conjuros para sanar el alma,\\" which toured Mexico in 2010. She participated in the Third Visual Dialog event in Assisi, Italy in 1995, and had exhibitions at the Season of House of Culture Gallery, Sophia, Bulgaria (1994), the Instituto Fern√°ndez de Fez en Marruecos, Granada, Spain (1997), Ciudad Universitaria (1997), Casa Lamm Cultural Center (1998), the MGM Grand Las Vegas (1999), Florence Biennale, Italy (1999), Llorona Gallery in Chicago (1999-2000) and the Galer√≠a Pedro Gerson in Mexico City (1998, 2000), the Universidad del Claustro de Sor Juana (2009), and an exhibition of a series of altar at the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana which took six years to make, in part because of invitations to travel to Argentina and Cuba. One of her works was published on the cover of Reader‚Äôs Digest in 1996. She has done murals at various hospitals of the √Ångeles network in Mexico and has done some abroad including ‚ÄúCatedrales‚Äù in San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca, Argentina and ‚ÄúLa danza de la vida‚Äù in Santiago de Cuba in 2009. She returned to Cuba in 2010 to install an art object and exhibition related to Mexico‚Äôs Bicentennial . Her work has been recognized with various awards which include Woman of the year of Tlalnepantla in the artist category in 1999 and second place at the ‚ÄúUn poemas a Sabines‚Äù competition in 2000. Also in 2000, she was the only woman inducted out of ten new members of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana. In 2013, the Centro Cultural del M√©xico Contempor√°neo (CCMC) held a retrospective of her work and in the same year, she was named ‚ÄúWoman of the year‚Äù of the State of Mexico. Artistry Her work has been divided into two stages. In the first, her work is marked by strong patriotism for Mexico. The second is more mystical and rebellious. Her mystical bent has been seen in individual shows such as \\"La piel de dios\\", \\"De los jardines amantes\\", \\"Secreto de piedra,\\" \\"Piel adentro\\" \\"In lak¬¥ ech a lak\\" and \\"Talismanes\\". In a number of works, the human body is obscured in darkness, thick texture and color, seen in Homenaje a Elizabeth Catlet, Lamento de un blues azul and A√∫n en las noches m√°s largas. She has also created works related to tragedy, such as the Mexico City earthquake of 1985 and an explosion at San Juanico, along with depictions of children with cancer and disabilities. She often works with natural materials such as stone, sand, vegetable pigments. She states that she believes in God, but as an ‚Äúessence‚Äù which exists in all parts of the universe. For this reason, she creates altars as artistic works such as ‚ÄúAltar a la madre tierra‚Äù which uses river stones as well as stones from the Tajin pyramid . There are Mexican indigenous influences in her work, especially her textiles which are inspired by traditional Mexican embroidery. Her 2011 exhibition, lak'ech, a lak'en (I am your other you, you are my other me), included altars, drawings and paintings done with natural paints and stone, using Mayan cosmology. Art critic Bertha Taracena states that her recent work, ‚Äúshows her conviction that pre Hispanic traditions and their magical splendor have relevance today.

The library is part of the Library Information Network of Clackamas County (LINCC), a consortium of 13 public libraries in Clackamas County. History The library opened on March 1, 1939 with a collection of 300 books. It was located on the second floor of the city hall building (which has since become the police station). Lucille Warren and Neva Teague were hired through the National Youth Administration to run the library. In 1965 city officials made plans for a new 7,000-square-foot $120,000 library building on city-owned property at West A Street and Willamette Falls Drive. Phillip R. Balsiger of Wilsonville was retained as architect. To supplement a $40,000 federal grant issued through the state library board, an $85,000 general obligation bond issue was put on the March 30 ballot. It included $5,000 for the purchase of books and periodicals for the new library. It was voted down by a vote of 152-108 out of approximately 2,500 eligible voters. The City Council put it back on the ballot for the May 28 election that same year, but it was voted down 434-247. In 1977 the library's collection consisted of 12,800 books and magazines and the second floor of City Hall was too small to accommodate the collection. 25 volunteers packed up 14,000 books on October 28, 1978 and the library moved into the community room of the Bolton Fire Station. By 1987 the library had outgrown the 1,500-square-foot space at the fire station. Since the library had moved to the fire station the collection had more than tripled and there were five times as many card holders. Boxes of books were stored in the attic. Many library programs had to be held in the engine bay with the fire trucks moved outside. On March 31, 1987 voters approved a $1.2 million bond proposal to finance construction of a dedicated library building. The library also received a $95,543 federal Library Services Construction Act grant. A list of 22 possible sites was narrowed down to three until the West Linn City Council approved a resolution authorizing the purchase of a 1.5-acre piece of land on Burns Street in April 1988. The new 10,000 square foot library, which was designed by SRG Partnership, opened on Burns Street in December 1989. In 1999 a $3.9 million bond measure to remodel and expand the library did not pass on the November 2 ballot because voter turnout was less than 50%. The following year on the May 16 ballot the bond measure passed. In June 2001 the library moved into temporary quarters at Bolton Primary School and construction began on the library expansion, which was again designed by SRG Partnership. In June 2002 the newly expanded 28,000 square foot building re-opened to the public. Facilities and services The library features two public meeting rooms, a small business resource center, an art gallery, public computer labs, and wireless access throughout the building. The library collection includes print and online resources, including over 114,000 materials in a wide variety of formats. The library offers educational, recreational and cultural programs including storytimes for kids, monthly programs for teens, summer reading programs for all ages, concerts, book clubs, and computer classes. In the 2012-2013 fiscal year the library offered 441 events, classes, and programs. Circulation The West Linn Public Library has 17,709 registered borrowers. In the 2012-2013 fiscal year patrons checked out 686,984 items, and reference librarians answered more than 7,391 reference and research questions.

The Collegian is a non-profit funded entirely through advertising revenue and receives no funding from the university or from student fees. In 2018, The Collegian scaled back its print edition to one issue per month, with digital-only articles continuing to be released daily. History Founded in 1890, the paper began as Aggie Life, became the College Signal in 1901, the Weekly Collegian in 1914 and the Tri- Weekly Collegian in 1956. Published daily from 1967 to 2013 and as a broadsheet since January 1994, the Collegian cut its Friday print paper in September 2013 due to declining ad revenue., The Collegian is one of the largest college newspapers in New England and the country. Publishing in 13 languages, it is also the most linguistically diverse college newspaper in the country. Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker cited the Collegian in an August 20, 2014 advertisement highlighting differences between himself and Democratic candidates then-Attorney General Martha Coakley and then-Treasurer Steve Grossman. Multilingual Publishing With a goal of making the Collegian more accessible to and reflective of the University of Massachusetts and the Pioneer Valley, Rebecca Duke Wiesenberg founded the Translations Department in 2017, which translates and creates original content in 12 languages. Each language section includes at least one editor and one translator. Editors are usually native speakers who have used the target language in higher education and other formal settings, and usually have translation experience; translators are either native speakers, heritage speakers or are currently learning the target language. In April 2018, the Collegian published a special issue explaining the translation process, introduce the translators to readers, as well as reflect on why being a multilingual newspaper is so significant to professional translators and journalists . Gender discrimination in the 1970s Andrea Dworkin, in \\"The Power of Words\\", narrated the history of a protest against gender discrimination at the Collegian in 1978. Women on the Collegian staff cited violent and discriminatory treatment in the newsroom, including threats made against Julie Melrose, women's editor, and a \\"hate campaign\\" calling activist women \\"lesbians\\". The paper's staff overturned a decision by the paper's board of directors to provide four ad-free pages per week to the women's editorial staff, and protests resulting in an occupation of the Collegian offices by women on staff began after talks between the two sides and the administration broke down. Published in the first issue of The Massachusetts Daily Occupied Collegian, \\"The Power of Words\\" was a given as a speech at a rally supporting the occupation of the Collegian offices by women staffers who faced censorship and suppression by male editors. Several women set up a blockade and resisted efforts to remove them from the office while publishing an \\"insurgent\\" newspaper for twelve days in May 1978. The Associated Press, which called the occupation a \\"feminist take-over\\", reported that the Collegian printed from temporary offices and called the administration's refusal to remove the women from the offices \\"irresponsible.\\" As of the tenth day of the protest, the women had vowed to continue the occupation into the summer vacation, the student judiciary had threatened to hold suspension hearings for occupying students, and \\"militant feminist\\" Robin Morgan had spoken during a 250-person march to the administration building. United Press International (UPI) reported that an agreement had been reached between occupying women, Collegian editors, and the university administration, which resulted in the creation of a fact-finding committee at the suggestion of Jean Elshtain then an associate professor of political science, and the refusal of administrators to pursue any academic penalties against the protestors. The membership of the committee consisted of four women and three men representing the stakeholders and three additional non-voting members, all appointed by Chancellor Randolph Bromery. Collegian editor William Sundstrom said that the result of the agreement was a \\"commitment to improve the quality and quantity of women's news\\", and that he was sure the women would \\"keep the issue alive next semester.\\" The commission recommended separate women's pages and editorial autonomy, the original demands of the women, in September 1978. The Chancellor refused to mandate that policy and the staff of the paper did not adopt it. The Collegian no longer has a women's editor.

The Silent Mountain is a love story set in the Dolomiti Mountains at the outbreak of World War I between Italy and Austria-Hungary in 1915. Plot The story begins on May 1915 in South Tyrol where Anderl Gruber, a son of a rich hotel owner, is attending the wedding of his sister Elisabeth (Lisl) with Italian Angelo Calzolari. There, he meets Angelo's sister Francesca, with whom he falls in love. However, the same day Italy declares war on Austria-Hungary. The tensions present between Austrians and Italians immediately escalate into the conflict between them, and they both join their respective armies. With expulsion of Italians by the villagers Francesca is forced to hide her identity. However, Fritz Weinberger, a local teacher who returns from the front and who has particularly strong hatred towards Italians, exploits this and offers Francesca to protect her identity in exchange for sexual favors. An Austrian Army platoon occupies the adjacent mountains and trick the attacking Italians to retreat. Later they are reinforced by a German Alpenkorps unit. Anderl is wounded in the fighting and ends up in hotel Gruber which is now a field hospital for wounded Austrian soldiers. Meanwhile, Anderl discovers Francesca's affair with Fritz and returns to the front in rage where he single-handedly repulses a massive attack of Italian infantry. Andrerl is severely wounded again. As the following Italian offensives also fail, Nicola Quinziato, the commander of Italian garrison orders Angelo, an experienced civil engineer, to dig a tunnel below the Austrian positions. Initially it is planned to launch an offensive through the tunnels, but later Quinziato decides to set the explosives below the mountain to blow up the Austrian troops. Angelo is discharged immediately after that and sent to the regular infantry, thus exposing him to the dangers of the war. Some time later, Angelo is caught by the Austrians where he reveals the Italian plans to blow up the mountain. Anderl helps Angelo to return to their village, while the German and Austrian troops decide to hold the mountain despite the imminent danger. Unfortunately, Angelo's identity is quickly discovered and he is summarily executed by the Austrian troops, with Elisabeth watching. Anderl looks for Francesca, forgives her and leads her out of the village to the mountains. They arrive close to the Austrian positions in the moment of explosion which annihilates the Austrian stronghold. They then leave the valley and Anderl later often thinks about their mountain, a mountain without the soldiers.

National Portrait Gallery, London General Officers of World War I (originally entitled Some General Officers of the Great War) is an oil painting by John Singer Sargent, completed in 1922. It was commissioned by South African financier Sir Abraham Bailey, 1st Baronet to commemorate the generals who commanded British and British Empire armies in the First World War. Background Sargent was initially unwilling to take on such a large project, but took the commission in January 1919 and began work in August 1920, after he completed his similarly huge painting, Gassed. He was also working on murals for the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts. Sargent found it difficult to find a suitable composition for so many full-length portraits, and Sargent himself foresaw a \\"horrible failure\\". The resulting painting is unsatisfactory, with 22 men in khaki uniforms standing like pillars in a crowd in front of an anonymous brownish void, possibly an open doorway, with the bases of fluted pillars to either side. Sargent described it as \\"painting them all standing up in a vacuum\\". They look forward with blank stares, with no discernible purpose, almost as if each was unaware of the others around him. The completed painting measures . It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1922. Bailey commissioned two other commemorative portraits, Statesmen of World War I by Sir James Guthrie, and Naval Officers of World War I by Sir Arthur Stockdale Cope. Bailey paid ¬£5,000 for each of the three paintings and donated all three to the National Portrait Gallery. Generals The painting depicts 22 of the approximately 1,500 brigadier-generals, major-generals, lieutenant-generals, generals, and field marshals who served in the British and Imperial armies in the First World War. All but two of the subjects reached the rank of at least lieutenant-general, and most were commanders of armies or army corps. The only two divisional commanders are Major-General Lukin and Major-General Russell. From left to right, they are: * Field Marshal William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood (commander of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps from 1914 to 1916, and of the British Fifth Army in 1918) * Field Marshal Jan Smuts (commander of Imperial forces in east Africa in 1916) * General Louis Botha (commander in southwest Africa) (blue lapel flashes) * Field Marshal Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy (commander of the British Third Army from 1917 to 1918) * General Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson (commander of the British Fourth Army from 1916 to 1918) (carrying a coat) * Major-General Sir Henry Lukin (commander of the South African Brigade from 1915 to 1916, and of the 9th (Scottish) Division from 1916 to 1918) * General Sir John Monash (commander of the Australian Corps from 1917 to 1918) * General Henry Horne, 1st Baron Horne (commander of the British First Army from September 1917) * Field Marshal George Milne, 1st Baron Milne (commander of British forces in Salonika from 1916 to 1918) * Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet (Chief of the Imperial General Staff from February 1918) * Major-General Sir Andrew Hamilton Russell (commander of the New Zealand Division from 1916 to 1918) * Field Marshal Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer (commander of the British Second Army from 1915 to 1917 and in 1918) (white moustache) * General Sir John Cowans (Quartermaster-General to the Forces from 1912 to 1919) * Field Marshal Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig (commander-in-chief of the British Expeditionary Force in France from December 1915 to 1918) (with baton) * Field Marshal John French, 1st Earl of Ypres (commander-in-chief of the British Expeditionary Force in France in 1914 to December 1915) (with baton, wearing coat) * Field Marshal Sir William Robertson, 1st Baronet (Chief of the Imperial General Staff from December 1915 to February 1918) * Lieutenant- General Sir Frederick Stanley Maude (commander of British forces in Mesopotamia from 1916 to his death in 1917) * Field Marshal Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby (commander of the British Third Army in 1916 to 1917, and the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in the Middle East) (turning away, with sword) * Lieutenant-General Sir William Marshall (commander of British forces in Mesopotamia from 1917 to 1918) * General Sir Arthur Currie (commander of the Canadian Corps from June 1917 to 1918) (carrying coat) * Field Marshal Rudolph Lambart, 10th Earl of Cavan (commander of the Italian Tenth Army from March 1918) * General Sir Charles Macpherson Dobell (commander in Cameroon from 1914 to 1916, and then in the Middle East until 1917) The generals are mostly British, but some representatives from the British Empire are also included: Field Marshal Smuts, General Botha and Major-General Lukin from South Africa, Generals Currie and Dobell from Canada, General Monash from Australia, and Major-General Russell from New Zealand. A list of potential subjects was compiled by Evan Charteris and Lewis Vernon Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt and approved by Bailey. Some were deliberately omitted (for example, General Ian Hamilton was blamed for the failure at Gallipoli and left out). Others prominent army commanders to be left out include Horace Smith- Dorrien, Hubert Gough, Charles Monro, Richard Haking, William Peyton, Charles Kavanagh, John Nixon, Percy Lake, and Charles Townshend; administrative officers such as Stanley Brenton von Donop, William Furse, Nevil Macready, George Macdonogh, Ronald Charles Maxwell and Travers Clarke, several Chiefs of the Imperial General Staff - Charles W. H. Douglas, James Wolfe Murray, and Archibald Murray - and army chiefs of staff, such as Tim Harington, Archibald Montgomery-Massingberd, Launcelot Kiggell and Herbert Lawrence. There are no officers from the Royal Flying Corps, such as Hugh Trenchard, David Henderson and John Salmond, or the Tank Corps, such as Hugh Elles.

Collins, 1899. p. 463 who had made his fortune in New York as dry goods merchant.John F. Stover (1987) History of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. p. 74  Biography  Loder was born at South Salem, New York February 15, 1801. He began life as a school teacher, and later engaged in the wholesale dry- goods trade in Cedar Street, New York City. Having accumulated a comfortable fortune, he had retired from active business life at the age of forty-three. The reputation he had made as a progressive and successful business man led the struggling New York and Erie Railroad Company, at a crisis in its affairs, to solicit him to take hold of them, and endeavor to save the Company from ruin. He was elected president, August 14, 1845, succeeding Eleazar Lord, and remained at the head of the Company eight years. Loder retired from the presidency broken in health. A friend, knowing of his large subscription to the stock of the Company, asked him, soon after he had retired, if he lost his money. No, said he, I neither lost nor made any money while with the railroad. As a matter of fact, the money President Loder received for his services, which were given night and day, barely reimbursed him for his expenses.See also: Edward Harold Mott 1899, p. 86-113 : Administration of Benjamin Loder In course of time, Loder's health was restored to somewhat of its old vigor, and he spent the closing days his life in Westchester County, New York. He died at Rye, October 7, 1876, aged seventy-five years. He was a modest, able, generous, and honest man. He was survived by two sons and five daughters. The older of the two sons died in 1890.  Work = Erie and New York Railroad  Map of New York & Erie Rail Road, 1844, showing the state of work. Loder was a native of Westchester County, N.Y. He had been for twenty years in the dry goods trade in New York, and had accumulated a fortune. It was said of him that he had never asked for bank accommodation in all his business career. According to a New York newspaper of that day:Edward Harold Mott (1899; p. 86-87)Quote also cited in: Edward Hungerford (1946) Men of Erie: A Story of Human Effort. p. 71 :He now, while yet in the prime of life, comes into the direction of the Erie Road with all the shrewdness which characterized the architect of his own fortunes, and the observation gained from his own daily intercourse with all classes of men lead them to believe that he is the Hercules, aided by a most able Hoard, who will, if any man can, drain the present miry slough. If all classes of men held that belief, events proved that they had held it wisely, for even the metaphor of his newspaper friend did not daunt him. The difficulties President Loder overcame during his struggle to complete the work he had engaged to complete were unprecedented in the history of the railroad, shirking as he did no exercise of physical endurance, shrinking from no encounter with physical hardships, nor leaving untried any effort of his mind that mind that might sustain and hasten to completion the task he had in hand.  Subscription for capital stock  Soon after Benjamin Loder was chosen president of Erie in 1845, he invited twenty-two of the richest men in New York City to meet him in conference at the New York Hotel. They met, and he at once declared to them that among them they must subscribe sufficient money to start up the work on the railroad and keep it going, a sum which he placed at S3,ooo,ooo. To set an example to the others, he himself subscribed ¬ß250,000, his entire fortune. Stephen Whitney, present at the 1845 meeting. Stephen Whitney, the millionaire cotton-merchant, was one of the men present at the meeting. He pulled at Mr. Loder's coat-tail to attract his attention, and admonished him not to risk his all in the enterprise. It will ruin you, the cautious cotton-merchant whispered in his ear. But President Loder shook his head, and refused to withdraw the subscription. Aroused by his confidence in the enterprise, the twenty-two men there and then subscribed the required amount. President Loder's first act was to open books for subscriptions to ¬ß3,000,000 of the capital stock of the Company, September 2, 1845, at the office of the Company, 50 Wall street. The plan of subscription was the payment of ¬ß5 per share as soon as required by the Company after the entire amount had been subscribed, on condition that interest at six per cent, per annum be paid semi-annually on all the instalments from the date of the respective payments until a single track from the Hudson to Lake Erie and the branch to Newburgh should be completed and in use; no instalment to be called in until 3O,O0O shares at $100 each were subscribed and accepted, nor any instalment to be more than $25 per share within a year after the $3,000,000 had been subscribed, nor more than ¬ß30 per share the second, nor more than $45 the third year; every subscriber to the stock, after paying $25 per share, and purchasing any bond or bonds issued under the act of May 14, 1845, to be entitled to exchange such bonds into stock of the Company at par, to an amount equal to his subscription.  Address to the public  President Loder issued an address to the public to accompany the plan for raising the necessary money. In this he made these interesting statements,Edward Harold Mott (1899; p. 87) published among other places in an 1845 edition of the Railway Locomotives and Cars journal:Railway Locomotives and Cars, Vol. 25. Simmons-Boardman Publishing Corporation, 1832/1845. p. 65 Financial conditions of Erie Railroad Company, 1844 Financial conditions of Erie Railroad Company, 1851 :To complete a single track to Lake Erie, six millions of dollars are required. The cost of the work to the stockholders will then be $7,350,000; and adding a liberal amount to provide for cars and engines for the commencement of business, the road, with a heavy (T) rail estimated at $65 per ton, will be brought into use for less than $20,000 per mile. The actual cost of the road will be over $28,000 per mile, but the liberality of the State, and the surrender of half of the stock by the present holders, reduces it to this very low rate. :In reference to the estimates, it may be proper to state, that responsible contractors have offered to take the whole work at prices nine per cent, less than those assumed in the calculations on which they were based. If the road can be completed it must pay large dividends. The results obtained in the sections already in use prove this. The great length of the work, the productiveness of the country through which it passes and to which it leads, the absence of all danger of injurious competition from rival routes, the numerous branches already existing or in contemplation, exceeding in the aggregate the length of the main trunk, the immense market which this city (New York) will afford for agricultural products of every description, and the boundless country whose inhabitants must be supplied with merchandise to be sent in exchange, appear to leave no reasonable doubt on this most important question. To these considerations must be added the great improvements in motive power which have recently been made, and which have demonstrated fully that railroads can, and do, compete successfully in the transportation of articles of heavy merchandise with any other mode of conveyance. :With regard to the indebtedness of the company, the amount of which is about $600,000, the board is happy to be able to state that, owing to the liberality manifested by the principal creditors, the time of payment for most of it has been extended, on satisfactory terms, the sum of $486,839.37, in the shape of six and seven per cent, certificates, payable on 1 January 1849. The holders of about one-half the remainder have agreed to settle by taking certificates of the same character, and the residue, including an amount due for work recently done on the Shawangunk summit, is in course of settlement, as the means of the company will permit. :Added to the other inducements are those of the release by the State of the $3,000,000 loan, and the reduction of the old stock from $1,500,000 to $750,000, making altogether a bonus of $3,750,000 to the new stockholders. Thus the whole work, on which about $5,000,000 has been expended, will be represented by stock and debts to the amount of only $1,350,000. More precise, of the $3,000,000 required to be raised by subscription, more than one million of dollars have been pledged in large sums by a very few friends of the road, leaving less than two millions to be raised by additional subscriptions, to secure the full benefit of the recent act of the Legislature. For comparison, when the Erie came into existence a quarter of a century earlier, it had stated : \\" The whole work, on which about ¬ß5,000,000 has been expended, will be represented by stock and debts to the amount only of ¬ß1,350,000.\\" In later days of Erie management this could well have been read thus: \\"The whole work, on which about ¬ß1,350,000 has been expended, will be represented by stocks and debts to the amount of ¬ß5,000,000.\\" A genuine inclination on the part of capital to take hold in earnest and push the New York and Erie Railroad to completion, now manifested itself. Individual members of the Board of Directors made committees of themselves to solicit subscriptions, and one of them, Director Sheldon, raised ¬ß100,000 among the grocers of New York in one day. By the beginning of October, 1845, the entire loan of ¬ß3,000,000 was subscribed, and Newburgh subscribed ¬ß100,000 toward the building of the Newburgh Branch.

He was nominated three times for the Academy Award for Best Dance Direction in the 1930s, and won the Golden Globe in 1958. Among the films whose dances he staged were Show Boat (1936), Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), Rhapsody in Blue (1945), and South Pacific (1958). Early life and military service LeRoy Jerome Prinz was born in St. Joseph, Missouri. His grandfather was a dancing master, and his father taught ballroom dancing etiquette to young men and women at Prinz's Academy in St. Joseph. According to one account, he was sent to reform school after chasing his stepmother with a carving knife. In newspaper profiles, he claimed that after running away from boarding school at the age of 15, he \\"hopped a freight\\" and came to New York City, where, in 1911, he began a blackface song and dance act, named Prinz and Buck, with a young black man he met along the way. Later that year, he told interviewers, he went on a ship to Europe as a cabin boy, jumped ship, and traveled around Europe \\"introducing the American strut step\\" in return for meals and lodging. In Marseilles, he joined the French Foreign Legion, serving as a bugler in Algiers. He also represented a rubber company in St. Louis and Kansas City. After the outbreak of World War I, he returned to France, trained as a pilot, and served in the French aviation corps and Captain Eddie Rickenbacker's 94th Aero Squadron. He was with the 94th from November 1917 to June 1918, when he switched to the 27th Aero Squadron, where he stayed until November 1918. At the 27th, his duties included working at the Aircraft Acceptance Park test facility at Orly, France. Prinz subsequently told journalists that he crashed 14 to 18 airplanes, was nicknamed \\"America's German Ace\\" as a result, (he was also called \\"Crash Ace Prinz) and that he was wounded in the war and carried a silver plate in his head from his last plane crash. In an October 1918 article, war correspondent George Seldes described how Prinz was separated from his flight on his first venture into German territory, and returned home with minor injuries after a perilous journey. Career According to his obituary in the Los Angeles Times, Prinz returned to the U.S. in 1919 and studied theater at Northwestern University. After graduation from Northwestern, the newspaper reported, Prinz returned to France and worked as a choreographer for the Folies Berg√®re in Paris. A November 1919 report in St. Louis Post-Dispatch states that Prinz was employed in the aeronautical portion of an American Legion show, also featuring actor William S. Hart, that was touring the area. The newspaper gives Prinz's rank as captain and states that he was a flight partner of Quentin Roosevelt. A Wisconsin newspaper reported in 1921 that Prinz, which it said had \\"danced with Al Jolson,\\" was teaching dance at a vacation camp for wounded veterans. The newspaper wrote that Prinz had \\"fallen 3000 feet\\" but had recovered. In various newspaper profiles, Prinz claimed that he worked as a dancer at a bordello in Omaha, as an aviation instructor for the Mexican government, and that he ferried ammunition for the Nicaraguan rebel leader, Augusto C√©sar Sandino. He told interviewers that he worked for gangster Jim Colosimo's restaurant in Chicago, and that he produced stage shows for Al Capone. He claimed in a 1945 New York Times profile that Capone hired him to book entertainment and stage floor shows at 18 Chicago nightclubs. Prinz left Chicago and worked as a dance director in New York, Florida, Mexico and Cuba. His employers included Earl Carroll, Broadway's Shubert family, Tex Guinan and Philadelphia bootlegger Boo Hoo Hoff. He choreographed Earl Carroll's Vanities of 1930 and other Broadway shows between 1929 and 1933. Prinz clashed with Agnes de Mille while staging dances for her uncle's film Cleopatra (1934). His first employment in films was in 1931 by director Cecil B. DeMille, who employed him as dance director. While filming Cleopatra (1934), Prinz clashed with DeMille's niece Agnes de Mille, who was brought in to choreograph dance sequences. According to Agnes de Mille's biographer, her uncle always deferred to the \\"reliable but pedestrian\\" Prinz, even after agreeing to his niece's flamboyant dances in advance. Agnes de Mille left the film. Prinz directed dance sequences for dozens of Paramount Pictures movies between 1933 and 1941, when he became dance director of Warner Brothers, where he staged all of Warner's musical sequences for the next 16 years. He worked on over 150 films, mainly as a choreographer, including The Desert Song (1929), Tea for Two (1950), and The Jazz Singer (1952), a remake of the first sound movie. In the 1940s, he worked on Road to Singapore (1940) at Paramount. His first major assignment at Warner Brothers was the George M. Cohan biographical movie Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), starring James Cagney in the title role. He choreographed a \\"ballet in jive\\" sequence in the service musical Hollywood Canteen (1944), featuring Broadway dancer Joan McCracken. Prinz played himself directing the sequence in a brief cameo. McCracken, who came to Hollywood after winning acclaim in the 1943 production of Oklahoma!, was discouraged by her experiences filming the Hollywood Canteen number and did not like working with Prinz. As a choreographer he made no effort to integrate his dances into specific stories, or to choreograph specific dance steps. This caused deep disillusionment for McCracken, whose Oklahoma! dances were choreographed by Agnes de Mille, because Prinz was not able to support or advance McCracken's artistic development. However, he gave her latitude to incorporate ballet in her dance routine, and Prinz did not object to her ideas. Prinz worked again with James Cagney, eight years after Yankee Doodle Dandy, on West Point Story, also starring Virginia Mayo and Doris Day. He ceased working in films after choreographing the Boar's Tooth Ceremonial dance sequence in the film adaptation of South Pacific (1958). Later in life, he was owner of his own production company, vice president of an advertising agency, and a producer of benefit programs in Hollywood. He counted among his friends Ronald Reagan, whom he knew from their days working together at Warner Brothers, and he choreographed entertainment at the 1976 Republican National Convention and at several presidential inaugurations. Reagan called him from the White House when Prinz was in the hospital shortly before he died. At the 1976 convention, he came up with the idea of playing \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" when convention organizers wanted to silence unruly delegates. Prinz was a \\"notorious self-promoter\\", and told stories about himself that were sometimes dubious. Columnist Michael Coakley recounted in a late-life profile of Prinz that editors of The Saturday Evening Post once were able to verify 90% of what they were told by Prinz, who sent them a telegraph stating \\"That's great. Don't believe 50 percent of it myself.\\" In a Los Angeles Times profile late in life, Prinz' claimed \\"at least partial credit\\" in popularizing the Charleston and rumba, which became popular after appearing in his movies. Awards Prinz was nominated in the long-defunct category of Best Dance Direction during the 1937 Academy Awards for Waikiki Wedding, and was twice nominated in this category for the 1935 films All the King's Horses and The Big Broadcast of 1936. He was awarded the Golden Globe for best film choreography in 1958. Though known mainly for his work as a dance director on big-budget musicals, he directed a number of mainly short films, one of which, A Boy and His Dog (1946), won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. Choreographic style and legacy In Prinz's choreography of films like Yankee Doodle Dandy, the camera was like a member of the audience. A New York Times profile wrote that \\"his life story reads more like the script of an Errol Flynn adventure\\", though the stories he told about himself were often dubious. He was once described as \\"a feisty little man who always had a cigarette dangling from his lips and looked more like a bartender than a choreographer.\\" Prinz was an \\"idea man\\" rather than as a choreographer, creating lavish production numbers and using simple steps and dance routines. Jazz dance choreographer Jack Cole has said that Prinz \\"didn't know a bloody thing about dancing.\\" In a 1952 profile, Associated Press Hollywood columnist James Bacon stated that Prinz differed from what he described as \\"sissified\\" choreographers, that he was \\"a rough, tough guy, as some little giants of 5 foot 5 are. His language is colorful.\\" He claimed never to have taken a lesson in his life, and in a reference to his family's dancing school, that he was a \\"victim of heredity.\\" As a choreographer at Warner Brothers, Prinz had a different approach than Busby Berkeley, whose choreography for early 1930s movies included elaborate production numbers that were photographed using imaginative camera angles, often from above. Berkeley's numbers \\"broke the boundaries of the stage,\\" and Prinz took a completely opposite approach, with the audience never able to forget that it was watching a stage performance. Prinz's style is evident in the Little Johnny Jones number in Yankee Doodle Dandy, which featured a stationary camera and included features of the stage, such as the orchestra pit, in the dance number. The camera, in effect, became a member of the audience. In his 1983 study of wartime Hollywood musicals, Allen L. Woll says that with the camera angles not being employed effectively, as they were by Berkeley, \\"the pedestrian quality of Prinz's dance numbers is painfully revealed. No matter the picture, no matter the director, Prinz's dances are invariably the same, static and stage-bound.\\" His treatment of dancers was sometimes caustic.

With a backward chaining procedure the learning can happen in two ways. In one approach the adult can complete all the steps for the learner and give the learner the opportunity to attempt the last one and prompt as needed. For the other approach the adult can prompt the learner throughout the steps on the chain and give the learner an opportunity to complete the last one independently. However, if unable to do so the adult helps by also prompting the learner through the last step and reinforcement is given to the learner once the last step is completed. Because independency is desired the goal is to remove the prompts as soon as the learner can complete the steps without help.  Task Analysis A task analysis involves breaking a complex skill into smaller teachable units creating a series of steps or tasks. In other words, it is the identification of all the stimuli and responses in a behavior chain. In backward chain task analysis, the final step of the routine is taught first so that the reinforcement for completing the step is accessible to the naturally occurring reinforcement.  Implementation In order to teach a task utilizing a backward chaining procedure, begin by breaking down the entire task into individual steps known as a task analysis. For example, a tooth brushing routine may be broken down as follows: 1\\\\. Grab toothbrush 2. Apply toothpaste to toothbrush, 3. Turn on water 4. Wet toothbrush, 5. Brush top teeth, 6. Brush bottom teeth, 7. Rinse toothbrush, 8. Turn of water 9. Put toothbrush away The trainer would begin by completing each step for the learner beginning with step one (Grabbing the toothbrush). Once the trainer has completed all steps, the trainer allows the learner to complete the last step (Put toothbrush away) independently. Once this step is independently mastered then the trainer can move on to training the last two steps (Steps 8 and 9). This training will continue until the student is completely independent and can complete the entire tooth brushing routine without assistance. It is important to note that transitioning from one step to the next will vary from learner to learner and should not be done until the learner is proficient in the targeted step. The trainer can either complete the steps for the leaner or physically prompt the learner through all the steps before allowing the learner to complete the last step independently. For example, a physical prompting of toothbrushing can look like hand over hand helping the learner complete all the steps correctly before letting the learner complete the last one independently. Prompting The two types of prompting in a behavior chain are either most to least(MTL) or least to most (LTM). MTL prompting is when the most intrusive prompt is introduced initially and then systematically faded out to least intrusive prompts. This prompting method is mainly used when the task analysis is being taught.Seaver, J. L., & Bourret, J. C. (2014). An evaluation of response prompts for teaching behavior chains. Journal of applied behavior analysis, 47(4), 777-792. LTM prompting there is no prompt initially, and the intrusiveness of the prompt is increased as necessary for each step of the task analysis. This prompting method is mainly used when you are doing an error correction on a specific step in the task analysis the learner has experience with. Steps of Implementation 1\\\\. When considering if backward chaining is appropriate for the learner one must consider if the learner is learning a new behavior or is it an issue with compliance. If the learner can not perform the task then the chain would be appropriate. If the learner can do the step but chooses not to then another procedure should be used in accordance with compliance. 2\\\\. Develop task analysis of the S - R chain When developing steps of the task analysis the steps should match the learner‚Äôs skill level. 3\\\\. Collect baseline data 4\\\\. Implement 5\\\\. Continue to collect data 6\\\\. Shift to intermittent reinforcement for maintenance  Fading & Mastery  In order to fade prompts on the steps being targeted the learner must show increased independence. The fading technique used will be most to least because the skills being worked on are new. The prompts will be decreased to least intrusive when the learner shows increased ability to complete the task with less assistance. To determine mastery, assessments are done prior to the chaining procedure being implemented to establish the learner‚Äôs mastery level. There are two methods that can be used to assess mastery: single and multiple opportunity.Snell, M. E., & Brown, F. (2006). Instruc- tion of students with severe disabilities (6th ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. # Single Opportunity: the learner is stopped if any step is skipped or they are unable to complete it. # Multiple Opportunity: allowing the learner to attempt each step in the chain Once the mastery level has been established, a mastery criterion is also determined before the chain can be implemented. The mastery criterion is set for each of the steps and learner is said to have mastered the skill once they can perform all steps on the chain at the predetermined mastery criterion.

Biography  Map of Iraq in the 9th‚Äì10th centuries Fuladh was the son of Manadhar, a Justanid king. Fuladh had a brother named Khusrau Shah, who ruled Rudbar after Manadhar. He also had an unnamed sister, who married the Buyid ruler Adud al-Dawla, and bore him two sons, Abu'l-Husain Ahmad and Abu Tahir Firuzshah. During that period, Fuladh, along with a Gilaki officer named Ziyar ibn Shahrakawayh, dominated the Buyid court of Baghdad. After the death of Adud al-Dawla, the Buyid Empire was thrown into civil war; the Empire was disputed between his two sons Samsam al- Dawla and Sharaf al-Dawla. Samsam al-Dawla ruled Iraq, while Sharaf al-Dawla ruled Fars and Kerman. In 986, a Daylamite officer named Asfar ibn Kurdawayh rebelled against Samsam al-Dawla, and changed his allegiance to Sharaf al- Dawla. However, Asfar quickly changed his mind, and declared allegiance to the latter's other brother Abu Nasr Firuz Kharshadh, who was shortly given the honorific epithet of \\"Baha' al-Dawla.\\" However, Samsam al-Dawla, with the aid of Fuladh, suppressed the rebellion, and imprisoned Baha al-Dawla. Samsam al- Dawla shortly made peace with Sharaf al-Dawla, and agreed to release Baha al- Dawla. In 987, Sharaf al-Dawla betrayed Samsam al-Dawla, conquered Iraq, and had him imprisoned in a fortress. He then imprisoned Fuladh and had Ziyar executed. In 988/989, Fuladh was released. After his release, Fuladh then began serving Samsam al-Dawla once again, this time in Shiraz, where he once again became a prominent figure in his court. However, Fuladh later tried to remove the viceroy of Shiraz, which forced him to flee from the wrath of Samsam. Fuladh managed to reach to the court of Fakhr al-Dawla in Ray, where he stayed until death in ca. 994. He had a son named Ibn Fuladh, who would later challenge Buyid authority and claim Qazvin as a part of his own domain.

She started the Food Babe blog in 2011, and it received over 54 million views in 2014. She is a New York Times best-selling author, and companies such as Chick-fil-A and Kraft may have changed or reconsidered ingredients in their products following her campaigns. Hari's ideas on food safety have been criticized by scientists as pseudoscience and chemophobia, and others have drawn attention to her financial interest through promotion and marketing of natural foods. Career Born in Charlotte, North Carolina to Indian immigrant parents from Punjab, India, Hari first attended the University of Georgia before transferring to University of North Carolina at Charlotte. After graduating in 2001 with a degree in computer science, she worked as a management consultant for Accenture. In her early 20s Hari was hospitalized with appendicitis. In response, she began looking into health and nutrition issues. She started the Food Babe blog in 2011, and left Accenture in 2012 to devote her time to activism and blogging, as well as marketing dietary and other products. By 2014, her blog was receiving over 54 million views. Hari has over 97,000 Twitter followers, and an official Facebook page with over one million likes. She refers to her followers and supporters as the \\"Food Babe Army.\\" Hari has capitalised on her following by selling books, subscriptions to her eating guide, meal plans, products through which she gains affiliate commissions,Khamis, Susie; Ang, Lawrence; Welling, Raymond (2016) \\"Self-branding, 'micro-celebrity' and the rise of Social Media Influencers\\", Celebrity studies, Vol.8 (2), pp. 191‚Äì208.Rubin, Courtney (March 15, 2015) \\"An Appetite for Controversy\\", The New York Times, The New York Times Company. and through marketing her own line of supplements under the Truvani brand.Bezzant, Niki (January 26, 2020) \\"Time to get off the social media diet\\", Herald on Sunday, Auckland, New Zealand. p22 Critics argue that the controversy she engenders through her activism helps drive sales through her site. Activisim In 2011, Hari wrote a piece about ingredients in Chick-fil-A sandwiches which she alleged to be harmful. Chick-fil-A responded to Hari's post in May 2012, inviting her to its headquarters in Atlanta to discuss her concerns. As part of a larger effort to improve the nutrition of their products, Chick-fil-A announced in late 2013 it was removing dyes, corn syrup, and TBHQ from their products. They also announced a plan to only use antibiotic-free chickens within the next five years. Hari has said that President Barack Obama has not kept a promise that he made during his 2008 presidential campaign to force the labeling of genetically modified food (GMOs). During the 2012 Democratic National Convention, which she attended as an elected delegate, Hari sat in the first row on the convention floor and held a sign that read \\"Label GMOs!\\" during Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack's speech. In 2012, Hari wrote a blog post regarding Chipotle describing her quest to get clear answers about what Chipotle used in their food, saying: \\"Most of their food was contaminated with genetically modified cooking oil, corn oil, and they were using genetically modified ingredients in their tortillas. Even in the black beans there was GMO soybean oil. You couldn't even order vegetarian and avoid it. It was really unfortunate. Then, when I saw their flour tortillas' package, it said that they use trans-fat. That's crazy.\\" After she published her blog post, Chipotle set up a meeting with Hari where she urged them to publish their ingredients publicly. In March 2013, Chipotle's Communications Director emailed Hari with a link to a new page on Chipotle's website with the ingredients in all of their menu items, along with a statement on the sidebar, \\"Our goal is to eliminate GMOs from Chipotle's ingredients, and we're working hard to meet this challenge.\\" In April 2015, Chipotle followed up on their commitment to remove GMO ingredients from their food and became the first national restaurant chain to use only non-GMO ingredients. In March 2013, Hari posted her first petition on Change.org asking Kraft Foods to remove FD&C; yellow #5 and FD&C; yellow #6 food dyes from their Mac & Cheese. On April 1, 2013, Hari visited Kraft headquarters in Chicago bringing along over 270,000 signed petitions and met with executives. Following Hari's visit, Kraft told ABC News Chicago they have \\"no plans to change the recipe for the original mac and cheese,\\" and \\"...the safety and quality of our products is our highest priority and we take consumer concerns very seriously. We carefully follow the laws and regulations in the countries where our products are sold.\\" Hari replied, \\"People have tried to petition the FDA over and over and it hasn't worked. The best way to create change is to hold the food companies responsible.\\" While the dyes are legal in the U.S., Kraft uses a different formula in the United Kingdom without artificial dyes. By the end of October 2013 the petition had received about 348,000 signatures. In October 2013, Kraft announced they would change the ingredients in three of its Mac & Cheese products aimed at children, which included the use of whole grains, reduction in salt and some fats, and changing the coloring; Kraft said that the changes were not a response to the petition but rather were part of an ongoing effort to improve the nutrition of the offerings, which takes several years to plan and implement. Hari claimed credit for the changes. In April 2015, Kraft further announced that they will remove artificial dyes and artificial preservatives from all of its Mac & Cheese products by 2016. In 2013, Hari wrote about the use of class IV caramel color in Newcastle Brown Ale on her blog and put public pressure on them to drop this ingredient. In January 2015, Heineken announced that they will stop adding class IV caramel color to their Newcastle Brown Ale, and will instead color it naturally with the same roasted malt they had previously used. Heineken's announcement came just prior to the release of her book, The Food Babe Way (February 10, 2015), that devotes a chapter to the ingredients‚Äîincluding caramel coloring‚Äîin some beers, wines, and liquors. In February 2014, Hari launched a petition on her website asking Subway to remove azodicarbonamide (a safe flour bleaching agent and dough conditioner)Frequently Asked Questions on Azodicarbonamide (ADA); FDA; page updated: June 20, 2014 from their sandwich bread. The petition gathered more than 50,000 signatures in 24 hours. Subway later announced a plan to remove the ingredient from all of their sandwich breads, a process which began before her campaign. The Center For Science In The Public Interest, who advocates for its reduction, credited Hari for drawing attention to it. The Environmental Working Group supported the removal of azodicarbonamide and urged against its use. Food science experts have pointed out that the level of azodicarbonamide permitted by the FDA for use in bread is too low to pose a significant risk. In June 2014, Hari posted a petition asking major brewers to list the ingredients in their products, something which U.S. brewers are not required to do. As part of this campaign, she claimed that commercial brewers \\"even use fish swim bladders\\" in their beer, as an undisclosed ingredient. NPR cited this as an example of fearmongering and lack of subject matter knowledge, as isinglass, derived from fish swim bladders, has been used as a natural fining agent in food and drink for centuries, and is in any case used primarily in cask ale, not vat-brewed beers, which are normally cleared by filtering. The day after she posted her petition, Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors released ingredients in many of their products. The trade publication Beer Marketer's Insights called Hari's petition an \\"attempt of fear-mongering in the name of advocacy.\\" Hari later claimed that she was aware of the historic use of isinglass, and was raising attention to it for the benefit of uninformed vegans and vegetarians. In October 2015 Guinness announced that they are stopping the use of isinglass in their refining process so that their beer will become vegan-friendly. In August 2014, Hari wrote a blog post in which she claimed there is a lack of transparency when it comes to the ingredients in Starbucks' drinks. She noted that Starbucks doesn't publish their ingredients online and pointed out the use of class IV caramel color and the lack of real pumpkin in Starbucks's Pumpkin Spice Latte. This blog post received over 10 million views in 2014, and in the fall of 2015 Starbucks debuted a reformulated Pumpkin Spice Latte with real pumpkin and without caramel color. Hari took credit for this change, claiming to have emailed them monthly for updates. On February 5, 2015 Hari launched a petition on her website asking General Mills and Kellogg's to remove the preservative butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) from their cereals. The additive has been widely used in cereal packaging in the U.S. for many years. BHT has to be listed as an ingredient on food labels, and some consumer-protection advocates like the Environmental Working Group have advised people to avoid it when possible. Cereals marketed in Europe by General Mills and Kellogg's do not contain the additive. Hari's petition received over 30,000 signatures in 24 hours. On February 5, 2015, General Mills released a statement that they are removing BHT from its cereal, stating, \\"This change is not for safety reasons, but because we think consumers will embrace it. We've never spoken with Vani Hari and she did not play any role in our decision,\\" and \\"...our removal of BHT from cereals is well underway and has been for more than a year.\\" In August 2015, Hari campaigned Subway in conjunction with Natural Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth, the Center for Food Safety, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group to commit to buying meat produced without the routine use of antibiotics and to provide a timeline for doing so. In October 2015, Subway announced they would transition to chicken raised without antibiotics in 2016 and turkey within the following 2‚Äì3 years, and would also transition beef and pork raised without antibiotics by 2025. Her petition about Kraft's ingredients received over 365,000 signatures, and her Subway petition received over 50,000 signatures in the first 24 hours. Her site had a reported 52 million visitors in 2014 and over 3 million unique visitors per month. In March 2015, Time named Hari among \\"The 30 Most Influential People on the Internet\\". Books=The Food Babe Way Hari's first book, The Food Babe Way, was released February 10, 2015. The book was #4 on the New York Times bestseller list for March 1, 2015 in the \\"Advice, How-To & Miscellaneous\\" section. It remained on the list for five weeks. It also appeared as #1 for nonfiction on the Wall Street Journal bestseller list for the week ending February 15, 2015. Feeding You Lies Hari released her second book, Feeding You Lies: How to Unravel the Food Industry's Playbook and Reclaim Your Health, in February 2019. The book appeared on the Wall Street Journal bestseller list for the week ending February 23, 2019. The Daily Beast also listed it amongst 12 Best Selling Books Published in February 2019. Reception Hari has received wide criticism concerning the accuracy, consistency, and presentation of her many claims. Hari is a former management consultant who has a degree in computer science, and has no expertise in nutrition or food science. In response to criticisms that she lacks training in these fields, Hari has stated, \\"I never claimed to be a nutritionist. I'm an investigator.\\" According to horticultural scientist Kevin Folta, Hari's lack of training often leads her to misinterpret peer-reviewed research and technical details about food chemistry, nutrition, and health. Chemist Joseph A. Schwarcz also criticizes her lack of scientific knowledge, saying: \\"It isn't hard to deconstruct her arguments. Most of them are so silly. Her basic tenet is guilt by association.\\" Cheryl Wischhover, a freelance Beauty/Health/Fitness writer in Elle described Hari's tactics as \\"manipulative\\", \\"sneaky\\", and \\"polarizing rather than productive.\\" Wischhover also wrote about cases of Hari deleting and failing to acknowledge past articles, and stated \\"The fact that she tried to 'disappear' these stories makes me distrust and discredit anything else she has to say, and it's mindboggling that others still take her seriously.\\" In December 2014, a National Public Radio article compared her activism to fear mongering. A 2015 Slate article described her writings as using \\"malicious metonymy\\" to be deceptive. Referring to the whole food movement, Marion Nestle, professor of nutrition, food studies, and public health at New York University, says Hari \\"gives the movement a bad name\\" and prefers Hari focus on more important issues. Yvette d'Entremont, science writer and former analytical chemist, writing for Gawker, criticized the lack of scientific support for Hari's claims, and described her writing as \\"the worst assault on science on the internet\\". Following d'Entremont's article, Marion Nestle stated that d'Entremont's criticisms were \\"valid scientifically\\", and that \\"the difficulty with the kinds of compounds that Vani Hari has been dealing with is that they're present in the food supply in very small amounts, and therefore it's very hard to test whether small amounts are harmful or not harmful, so the science is uncertain, it's nuanced, it's very hard to talk about.\\" Her concern with Hari is that she \\"turns these things into something that's black or white‚Äîvery easy for people to understand, but not necessarily accurate.\\" Hari has also been accused of banning dissenters from the Food Babe LLC social media accounts in order to create an echo chamber. Social media groups for people who have been banned by Hari have sprung up as a result of these tactics. Promotion of pseudoscience Hari has been criticized by scientists and others for promoting pseudoscience. Kevin Folta has accused Hari of being \\"afraid of scientific engagement\\". Folta stated that while her campaigns have been driven by \\"honest intention\\", they had the effect of spreading scientific disinformation. Chemistry professor Joseph A. Schwarcz, director of McGill University's Office for Science and Society states Hari \\"has no understanding of chemistry or food science\\" and that \\"her scientific background is nonexistent\\". He describes azodicarbonamide, a chemical Hari opposes the usage of, as being safe for use in food but unessential. Following her beer campaign, David Gorski, a surgeon, stated that she was \\"peddling pseudoscience\\" by portraying the chemicals used in the making of beer as dangerous. In a July 2012 post (which has since been removed), Hari quoted the ideas of Masaru Emoto that microwave ovens cause water molecules to form crystals that resemble crystals exposed to negative thoughts or beliefs, such as when the words \\"Hitler\\" and \\"Satan\\" were exposed to the water. Steven Novella calls Emoto's claims \\"pure pseudoscience\\" and states that \\"Hari's conclusions about microwaves are all demonstrably incorrect and at odds with the scientific evidence\\". She later described the post as not her \\"most impressive piece of work\\" and noted that it was written when she had first started blogging. In a widely discredited 2011 post, Hari warned readers that the air pumped into aircraft cabins was not pure oxygen, complaining it was \\"mixed with nitrogen, sometimes almost at 50 per cent\\" despite ambient air being 78% nitrogen. Hari deleted the post, later claiming it contained an \\"inadvertent error\\". In an October 2011 blog post, Hari claimed getting the flu is not dangerous but getting a flu shot is, and the following day tweeted that flu vaccines have been \\"used as a genocide tool in the past\\". The tweet was subsequently deleted. Hari's position was criticized as false and dangerous by the American Council on Science and Health. In The Food Babe Way, Hari states: \\"There is just no acceptable level of any chemical to ingest, ever.\\" This quote was noted by The Atlantic in its review of the book, used as a pull quote, and criticised at length. The statement was widely commented on in the press and with public organizations promoting science, such as McGill University's Office for Science and Society and the American Council on Science and Health. Financial interests In an article in Bloomberg Businessweek, Duane D. Stanford wrote that Hari has an apparent financial interest by generating controversy in order to draw traffic to her website to increase ad sales and drive readers to buy a subscription to her organic Eating Guide, which Hari says is her primary source of revenue. Hari's critics have drawn attention to her affiliated marketing partnerships with organic and non-GMO brands from which she profits by recommending them over mainstream brands. A 2015 article in Skeptical Inquirer details products Hari declares as having toxic ingredients while Hari promotes and receives sales commissions for products containing the same or similar ingredients. Hari's claims of toxicity have been dismissed by experts in science and medicine as incorrect or exaggerated. Hari in the past removed a product from her site when attention was drawn to it as containing chemicals she has spoken against, a body scrub called Fresh, which contained butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). However, Hari claims that BHT is not as toxic if applied to skin as opposed to ingested.

As a member of the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America (Maryknoll) he was assigned to missions in South Korea. He served as the first Bishop of Cheongju from 1962 to 1972. Early life and education James Pardy was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of William and Sara (McCarran) Pardy and was one of 11 children. He was educated in the local public schools and the New York Preparatory School. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from St. Francis College in Brooklyn Heights before he entered the novitiate for the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America, or Maryknoll, and professed religious vows in 1925. Pardy earned a Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree from The Catholic University of America. He was ordained a priest on January 26, 1930. Priesthood After his ordination Pardy taught at the Maryknoll Minor Seminary for two years after which he was assigned to the mission field in Korea. In 1939 he became the superior of the Maryknollers in Korea. During World War II he served as a military chaplain in the United States Army attaining the rank of Major. He was captured by the Japanese and interred for ten months. For his service to the Prisoners of war in South Korea, Pardy was awarded the Medal of Freedom. From 1945 to 1948 Pardy served as the rector on the Maryknoll Minor Seminary and then as the director of the formation of candidates from 1948 to 1951. That year he was sent back to South Korea where he once again became the superior of all the Maryknollers in Korea in 1953. He was elected as the Maryknoll Vicar General in 1956. Pope Pius XII named Pardy the Titular Bishop of Irenopolis in Isauria and Vicar Apostolic of Cheongju on July 4, 1958. Episcopacy James Pardy was consecrated a bishop on September 16, 1958 by Bishop Bryan McEntegart of Brooklyn. The principal co-consecrators were U.S. Military Auxiliary Bishop Philip Furlong and Bishop Christopher Weldon of Springfield in Massachusetts. Bishop Fulton Sheen delivered the sermon. At his consecration he was given the crosier used by Cardinal John McCloskey of New York and Bishop Patrick Byrne, M.M., who died on a death march to the Yalu River. On March 10, 1962 Pope John XXIII named Pardy as the first bishop of the Diocese of Cheongju. He attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965). Pope Paul VI accepted Bishop Pardy's resignation as Bishop of Cheongju on April 18, 1972. Later life and death Bishop Pardy died at El Camino Real Hospital in Mountain View, California on February 15, 1983 at the age of 84. His funeral was celebrated in the Maryknoll Chapel in New York and he was buried in the Maryknoll Cemetery.

In the 1920s and 1930s ice hockey increasingly became a tough competitor to bandy. The federation eventually let go of bandy and was renamed the Nederlandse Hockey Bond in 1935. However, bandy was still played by som clubs during the 1950s and 1960s. Sometimes it was played as rink bandy. By 1971 the new Nederlandse Bandy Federatie was founded. It became a member of the Federation of International Bandy in 1973 (or the International Bandy Federation, as it was known at the time), as the first non-founding member.

Salath Rasasack (born April 10, 1934) is a former Laotian politician who was held as a political prisoner at a concentration camp (5 A, 5 B) in Laos for over 16 years. He was released in 1991 after Amnesty International negotiated on his behalf. He is a former Senator of the Lao Government. Early life and political career Rasasack was born on April 10, 1934 in Savannakhet, Laos. Rasasack has a Buddhist lineage and was a name given to shoe cleaners. Rasasack was educated at the College of Savannakhet. He furthered his education in police training in Chalon -Sur- Sa√¥ne and Saint- Cyr-au-Mont d'Or, France. Rasasack was elected as Congressman for the Province of Saravane, Laos. Thereafter, he was elected as Minister and Senator to the Two-Party Coalition Assembly. Detainment Prior to his life as a Senator, Rasasack was a Police Commissioner for the Royal Lao Government. He disappeared in 1975 after he was summoned by the President of the Coalition Assembly for a meeting. This was the last contact Rasasack had with his family and friends. While he was in the concentration camp, Rasasack lived in fear of losing his life as other political prisoners were being systematically executed. Rasasack also suffered physical and psychological abuse by the prison officials. Many political prisoners did not live to tell their stories of abuse and torture at the hands of the communist regime. Release It was learned that Amnesty International's Japanese chapter negotiated Salath Rasasack's release from the political prison after 16 years. On November 13, 1991 Rasasack was reunited with his family, wife Chansouk Manibod Rasasack (daughter of Phagna Tha Manibod-former Chief Justice for the Kingdom of Laos, former Mayor and Governor of Laos), sons, Salysanh Rasasack, Souksanh Rasasack, Sacksith Rasasack and daughter, Soukhy Mont d'Or Rasasack Clark (former Miss Memphis Lao Sport, 1987). Clark was approximately 4 years old when her father was taken to a political concentration camp. The majority of the Rasasacks currently reside in Memphis, Tennessee. The day Salath Rasasack arrived at the Memphis International Airport, over 150 people arrived to meet and welcome Rasasack to a life of freedom. Upon his arrival, Rasasack brought along a prison blanket. When asked by the reporters as to the significance of the blanket, Rasasack, shared that it had been his security blanket for over 16 years.

Description It is differentiated from closely related species by its strongly curved column without column wings and its broadly rhombic- elliptic lip with 2 uncinate calli at the base. It also has two pollinia attached by long and prominent caudicles (not stipes), to a distinct sticky disc. Distribution, habitat, and ecology Liparis pingxiangensis is a terrestrial orchid. It forms scattered colonies in shady, damp ravines. It occurs in wet to moist soil on steeper slopes. It is found at elevations around in mixed deciduous forest in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. It flowers in the early spring until late April. It has not been observed in fruit. Conservation status Liparis pingxiangensis is a rare species occurs in a rather small population (no more than 10 individuals). It is only known from the type collection and a neighboring population. The forest has been experiencing a continuing decline in quality of habitat due to deforestation. Using the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List categories and criteria, L. pingxiangensis should be treated as critically endangered due to its rarity and the threat of disturbance.

Production began in 1918. The company originated from the earlier National Motors Manufacturing Company, also of Irvington. The vehicles used proprietary engines, transmissions, and rear axles. The brand used a worm-gear final drive, leading to a smooth drive - this was considered enough of a selling argument that a worm gear was adopted as the brand's logo and heavily used in the brand's advertising. Day- Elder also had a steady market in fire trucks, and chassis were sold to be used as taxicabs in New York City. Some sources state that the brand was applied to trucks at least as early as 1916, although this seems unlikely as the company was only incorporated on December 26, 1916. History When introduced, Day-Elder offered four models, of one, two, three, or six tonnes capacity. Their New York debut was at the Armory in February 1919. By 1920 the range was up to six \\"standardized\\" models, still within the same weight range. The company's president was a Charles P. Day, who founded the company together with a F. G. Elder and a Theo. McMarsh. Day-Elder used four-cylinder engines from Buda Engine Co. or Continental. Transmissions came from Muncie or Brown- Lipe, while rear axles were from Timken, Sheldon, or Columbia. Fairly successful for a manufacturer which depended on outside suppliers for major parts, they began to reach nationwide distribution in the twenties and were also sold in Canada. Most of their early expansion was east of the Mississippi river, but as early as 1920 their farm trucks were being advertised on the West Coast. The brand's market then began to shrink and they were once again confined mostly to the local tri-state area. Eastport, NY D.E. introduced a six-cylinder range (dubbed the \\"Super Service Sixes\\") in July 1930. This range, comprising eleven models, had fully enclosed \\"all-weather\\" cabins and chrome exterior fittings. In order to better compete with other manufacturers who were strong in D.E.'s home area, they then added heavier trucks of up to 8 tonnes in 1930, and engines from Hercules and others were also made available.Mroz, p. 83 None of this sufficed however, and Day-Elder ended up shutting its doors in 1937, as they could not weather the Great Depression.

The period took place soon after the Haidamaka Uprisings (also known as Koliivshchyna) rocked lands of former Cossack Hetmanate. It was a period when the Ukrainian national resistance was almost entirely subjugated and went completely underground. All the state institutions of the Cossack Hetmanate were completely liquidated along with the Cossack movement. The European territory of the Russian Empire had successfully crossed the Dnieper and extended towards the Central Europe as well as reaching the shores of Black Sea. Nonetheless, the period also is considered to be the beginning of the modern Ukrainian literature among which first were works of Ivan Kotliarevsky. Number of Ukrainian historians such as Volodymyr Doroshenko and Mykhailo Hrushevsky divided that period in three stages. The first stage stretches from the end of the 18th century to 1840s. The second stage covers period of 1840s-1850s. The third period is the second half of the 19th century. Novhorod-Siversky Patriotic Circle Novhorod- Siversky Patriotic Circle existed prior to the Patriotic war of 1812 in Novhorod-Siverskyi, Russian Empire. Its members included such personalities like Andriy Hudovych, Tymofiy Kalynsky, Ivan Khalansky, Arkhyp Khudorba, Pavlo Koropchevsky, Opanas Lobysevych (one of the leaders), Mykhailo Myklashevsky, Hryhoriy Poletyka, Andriy Rachynsky, Bishop Verlaam Shyshatsky, Fedir Tumansky, Melkhysedek Znachko-Yavorsky, H. Dolynsky, S. Shyrai, and A. Pryhara. There are speculations that the 1791 secret mission of Vasily Kapnist to Berlin was connected with that circle. The circle played a key role in revival of Cossack regiments (see Ivan Kotlyarevsky). Sts Cyril and Methodius Brotherhood Brotherhood of Sts Cyril and Methodius was a short- lasting underground anti-absolutist organization of Russian Empire based in Kyiv and consisting of 12 members. Ideas of Pan-Slavism were popular among some of its participants. Hromada A network of hromadas (Ukrainian communities) appeared soon after the liquidation of the Sts Cyril and Methodius Brotherhood and was heavily influenced by the ongoing Khlopomanstvo movement on the territory of modern Ukraine. The first such hromada appeared in the capital of Russian Empire, Saint Petersburg. Many members were editors of the Ukrainian magazine Osnova that was published in 1861-62. Among the later members of the Saint Peterburg Hromada were Volodymyr Leontovych, Petro Stebnytsky and others. The most influential hromada, however, appeared in Kyiv, members of which were Volodymyr Antonovych, Mykhailo Drahomanov, Mykola Lysenko, Pavlo Chubynsky, and many others. Alternatively called the Old Hromada, Hromada of Kyiv played a key role in appearance of numerous Ukrainian political and cultural organizations in the Ukrainian guberniyas of the Russian Empire such as the Society of Ukrainian Progressionists, Revolutionary Ukrainian Party, Prosvita (Enlightment), and others. Some powerful hromadas existed in Odessa, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Poltava and elsewhere. In the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary The Ukrainian national revival in the territory what is today Western Ukraine is considered to have started around 1837, when Markiyan Shashkevych, Ivan Vahylevych and Yakiv Holovatsky published Rusalka Dnistrovaya, an almanac of Ukrainian folk songs in Buda, Hungary. During the Revolution of 1848, the Supreme Ruthenian Council was founded in Lviv, becoming the first legal Ukrainian political organization. In May 1848, Zoria Halytska started publishing as the first newspaper in Ukrainian language. In 1890, Ukrainian Radical Party, the first Ukrainian political party, was founded.

Pathogenic Ascosphaera species afflict only the larval stage of bees. Typically, diseased larvae die in the larval stage; in rare occurrences, however, larvae have been observed to enter pupation before being overcome by the fungus. Description The mating system is heterothallic. Infected larvae appear shrunken, pale buff, covered by a weft of hyphae, with or without the production of ascomata. The ascomata are greenish (immature) to black (mature) spore cysts produced on aerial hyphae above the larval cuticle, measuring 40‚Äì119 ¬µm in diameter. The spore wall is pale greenish to yellowish- brown, nearly smooth with minute punctae at high magnification. Spore balls are hyaline to pale yellowish, without granules, 7‚Äì20 ¬µm in diameter, and mostly persistent. The ascospores are ellipsoid to somewhat sausage shaped, and measure 2.1‚Äì3.9 by 1.1‚Äì1.7 ¬µm. Cultures grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar show rapid growth after 2‚Äì6 days; they are white with abundant production of spore cysts when both mating strains are present. Ecology and distribution Ascosphaera aggregate is an obligate pathogen with a preference for bees belonging to the family Megachilidae. This species has a broad distribution, with reports from both North America and Europe. This fast-growing saprotroph is associated primarily with solitary bees. This species is typically found growing on pollen provisions. Less common substrates from which A. agra has been isolated include the surface of a diseased M. rotundata larva with chalkbrood caused by A. aggregate, from pollen within the gut of an otherwise healthy M. rotundata larva and from the honey of A. mellifera. Ascosphaera agra is the only species of the genus that has been found growing on plant material (grass silage) outside of the bee habitat. Pathogenicity studies demonstrated that A. agra is not a pathogen of solitary bees; however it has been concluded that it is a weak pathogen of honeybees.

Beshear, and its companion case Love v. Beshear. In Bourke, a U.S. district court found that the Equal Protection Clause requires Kentucky to recognize valid same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions. In Love, the same court found that this same clause renders Kentucky's ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional. Both decisions were stayed and consolidated upon appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard oral arguments in both cases on August 6, 2014. On November 6, the Sixth Circuit upheld Kentucky's ban on same-sex marriage. On January 16, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court consolidated these cases with three others and agreed to review the case under the name Obergefell v. Hodges.https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/011615zr_f2q3.pdf Oral arguments were heard on April 28, 2015, and the Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in June 2015. District court proceedings On July 26, 2013, Gregory Bourke and Michael DeLeon, who were legally married in Ontario, Canada, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky challenging Kentucky's refusal to recognize their marriage on behalf of themselves and DeLeon's two adopted children. They later added as plaintiffs a couple married in Iowa and another in California, and the four children of one of them. On August 16, a fourth couple, married in Connecticut, filed a related suit in the same court but then joined the suit as plaintiffs. Named as defendants were Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear and Attorney General Jack Conway, as well as Sue Carole Perry, Shelby County Clerk. Their suit, Bourke v. Beshear, argued that Kentucky should recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions. The case was assigned to Judge John G. Heyburn II. Bourke decision In a decision issued February 12, 2014, Judge Heyburn found that Kentucky must recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions because withholding recognition violates the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal protection. He wrote: He pointed out the evolution of judicial recognition of same-sex marriage: \\"In Romer, Lawrence, and finally, Windsor, the Supreme Court has moved interstitially ... establishing the framework of cases from which district judges now draw wisdom and inspiration. Each of these small steps has led to this place and this time, where the right of same-sex spouses to the state-conferred benefits of marriage is virtually compelled.\\" He told attorneys he would hold a hearing before issuing an order implementing his decision. Bifurcation of case On February 14, two same-sex couples who were denied marriage licenses in Jefferson County, Timothy Love, Lawrence Ysunza, Maurice Blanchard, and Dominique James, asked to be allowed to intervene in the suit because their challenge to Kentucky's ban on same-sex marriage within the state raises substantially the same arguments as the original suit. On February 27, 2014, before the final order was issued, the state attorney general asked Judge Heyburn to stay enforcement of his Bourke order for 90 days, noting that even if the state does not appeal the decision it needs time to implement it. Judge Heyburn issued a final order in Bourke on the same day ordering the state to recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions at once, which created de jure legalization of recognition of out-of-state same-sex marriages; being a final order it was then immediately subject to appeal. He then bifurcated the case and allowed the new plaintiffs to intervene and argue against Kentucky's denial of marriage licenses to in-state same-sex couples. This portion of the case would remain in district court, retitled as Love v. Beshear. A briefing schedule on the in-state issue was completed by May 28. On February 28, 2014, Judge Heyburn issued a shorter, 21-day stay in Bourke, instead. Bourke appeal On March 4, 2014, the state attorney general announced that he would neither appeal the state's position nor request further stays. Kentucky's governor said he would employ outside counsel to appeal Heyburn's ruling in Bourke to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and to request a stay pending appeal. On March 19, Judge Heyburn extended his stay pending action by the Sixth Circuit, noting the stay granted by the U.S. Supreme Court in a similar Utah case. An interlocutory appeal of Bourke was lodged in the Sixth Circuit on March 19 under appellate case number 14-5291. By the time oral arguments were scheduled, the decision in the companion case Love v. Beshear was handed down and appealed; the Sixth Circuit thus consolidated the cases for argument (see below). Love decision The addition of intervening plaintiffs the Bourke lawsuit (dealing with the recognition of out-of-state same-sex marriages, see above) on the related issue of denial of marriage licenses to in-state same-sex couples, required the court to bifurcate the case and restyle it. Love v. Beshear continued in district court as to the state marriage license issue, while the out-of-state recognition issue was appealed. On July 1, 2014, U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn II found in favor of the intervening same-sex couple plaintiffs and ruled that Kentucky's ban on allowing same-sex marriage in-state violates the Equal Protection Clause. In doing so, Judge Heyburn departs from the opinions issued by most of the other U.S. district courts that examined the issue; he \\"does not determine whether Kentucky's laws interfere with a fundamental right.\\" Looking at the trio of marriage cases of Loving v. Virginia, Zablocki v. Redhail, and Turner v. Safley; Judge Heyburn states that: He is hesitant to answer in the affirmative, reasoning that \\"holding that the fundamental right to marry encompasses same-sex marriage would be a dramatic step that the Supreme Court has not yet indicated a willingness to take\\" (emphasis added.) Judge Heyburn then notes that he can bypass answering this question. Instead, the judge finds that homosexual persons constitute a suspect class. Although Sixth Circuit precedent suggests that sexual orientation classifications do not receive heightened scrutiny, Heyburn prods the circuit court \\"to reconsider its view\\" as this precedent relied on Bowers v. Hardwick, a Supreme Court case subsequently overturned as \\"not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today.\\" (citing Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 at 575) He does the analysis required and finds the heightened scrutiny of a \\"quasi-suspect\\" class applies to the case; but even under the lower \\"rational basis\\" review, the state does not bear its burden in justifying exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage. Heyburn concludes that the defendants' arguments for exclusion, i.e. encouraging relationships that procreate and stabilize the birthrate, \\"are not those of serious people,\\" finding no relation between same-sex marriage and heterosexual procreation.Love v. Beshear, Judge Heyburn stayed his ruling in Love pending the outcome of any appeal. Court of Appeals proceedings Upon motion of appellee same-sex couples, the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals consolidated Love v. Beshear, now docketed 14-5818 on appeal, and dealing with in-state licensing of same-sex marriage ‚Äî with Bourke v. Beshear, already under appeal under docket 14-5291, and dealing with out-of- state same-sex marriage recognition. A July 16, 2014, order by the Sixth Circuit set an expedited briefing schedule: state appellants' opening brief due July 17, appellee same-sex couples' principal brief due July 24, and appellants' reply due July 31. Oral arguments for the consolidated Love and Bourke cases were held on August 6, 2014; the Sixth Circuit heard same-sex marriage cases stemming from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee on that date as well. Reversal On November 6, the Sixth Circuit ruled 2‚Äì1 that Kentucky's ban on same-sex marriage does not violate the constitution. It said it was bound by the U.S. Supreme Court's 1972 action in a similar case, Baker v. Nelson, which dismissed a same-sex couple's marriage claim \\"for want of a substantial federal question.\\" Writing for the majority, Judge Jeffrey Sutton also dismissed the arguments made on behalf of same-sex couples in this case: \\"Not one of the plaintiffs' theories, however, makes the case for constitutionalizing the definition of marriage and for removing the issue from the place it has been since the founding: in the hands of state voters.\\" Dissenting, Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey wrote: \\"Because the correct result is so obvious, one is tempted to speculate that the majority has purposefully taken the contrary position to create the circuit split regarding the legality of same-sex marriage that could prompt a grant of certiorari by the Supreme Court and an end to the uncertainty of status and the interstate chaos that the current discrepancy in state laws threatens.\\" Supreme Court proceedings The same-sex couples filed an application for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on November 17. On January 16, 2015, the United States Supreme Court consolidated this case with three others from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee and agreed to review the case, setting a briefing schedule to be completed April 17. The court asked the parties to address two questions: \\"1) Does the Fourteenth Amendment require a state to license a marriage between two people of the same sex? 2) Does the Fourteenth Amendment require a state to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state?\\" This case was combined with several others and became part of the Obergefell v. Hodges case which was decided June 26, 2015 by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 5‚Äì4 decision that: \\"The Fourteenth Amendment requires a state to license a marriage between two people of the same sex and to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state.\\" See also * LGBT rights in Kentucky * Same-sex marriage in Kentucky * Same-sex marriage in the United States ReferencesExternal links * Bourke v.

A lust-motivated serial killer, Garayo first killed prostitutes after hiring and sleeping with them consensually, but grew more disorganized and violent as time went on, attacking, raping and murdering women that he saw walking alone in the country. His last two victims, murdered in consecutive days, were also stabbed, and the second was disembowelled. Garayo's persona and crimes were the subject of El Sacamantecas, an 1881 monograph written by Ricardo Becerro de Bengoa, who visited Garayo while he was in prison awaiting execution.  Early life and family  Garayo was born on October 17, 1821, the ninth child of farmers Nicol√°s D√≠az de Garayo and Norberta Ruiz de Argando√±a, in Eguilaz, a village near the town of Salvatierra in √Ålava, Basque Country, Spain.Baptism certificateEl Sacamantecas, p. 15 He was illiterate, never received an education, hard working and austere. Between the murders he lived and worked in Vitoria as usual, attracting no suspicion.El Sacamantecas, p. 14 At age 14, during the First Carlist War, Garayo was sent by his parents to serve in the neighbouring towns of Salvatierra, Alaiza, Oc√°riz, Izarza, A√±ua and Alegr√≠a-Dulantzi, where he worked temporally as a farmhand, shepherd and coal miner.

The couple had five children, three of whom (C√°ndido, Josefa and Tom√°sGamboa, Erlantz (2011) Enciclopedia del crimen y el sadismo. Leer-e, Pamplona) survived. This marriage ended in 1863 with the death of La Zurrumbona, and Garayo married his second wife, Juana Salazar,Gamboa, Erlantz (2011) Enciclopedia del crimen y el sadismo. Leer-e, PamplonaDiario de Noticias de √Ålava shortly after. Unlike the first marriage, which was happy, the second was loaded with conflict between his new wife and her stepchildren. His eldest son left to serve in a house and the other two increasingly spent their time in the street away from the family home. Salazar died from smallpox in 1870 and Garayo committed his first murder shortly after. Garayo married a third time, again shortly after the death of his previous wife, and this marriage was even more plagued by conflict, as the woman was an alcoholic. After only five years of marriage, in 1876, Garayo found his wife bedridden and in agony upon returning from work; he called for a doctor but was told that nothing could be done about it. One month later he married his fourth and last wife, an old widowEl Sacamantecas, pp. 15‚Äì22 named Juana Ibisate.Gamboa, Erlantz (2011) Enciclopedia del crimen y el sadismo.

When asked about the most suspicious, the third, the imprisoned Garayo declared:El Sacamantecas, p. 51  Murders = First spree  Medieval walls of Vitoria Garayo's first victim was a well known woman from Vitoria that had turned to prostitution while her husband was in jail, and he hired in the afternoon of April 2, 1870. The two walked out of the city through the Portal del Rey, took the road to Navarre, and stopped by the Recachiqui (Errekatxiki Gamboa, Erlantz (2011) Enciclopedia del crimen y el sadismo. Leer-e, PamplonaDiario de Noticias de √Ålava) stream to have sex. Once done Garayo offered her three Spanish reales and she protested for finding it too short. Garayo offered one more real but she demanded five. At this point, Garayo threw her to the ground and oppressed her throat with both hands until she became unconscious. He then took his victim to the stream and submerged her head in the water until she drowned. Garayo then undressed the body and placed it face up on the ground. He sat next to the body for a while before covering it with the clothes and returned to the city during the night. The murder was discovered the next morning by a servant that was picking flowers by the bankside and alerted the authorities, but the case was archived for lack of evidence shortly after. The second murder was committed on March 12, 1871 also during the afternoon. Garayo met a poor widow begging in Portal del Rey and offered her to come with him. After she said that she had not eaten that day, Garayo gave her one real and told her to not get late, saying that he would be waiting for her in the road to Navarre. The woman bought bread and a glass of wine in an inn and the two walked the road to a place known as Labizcarra, 400 meters from the Recachiqui, where they had sex. Once again, Garayo offered a short sum, the woman protested and he brought her down and strangled her with his hands, returning home at night. The body was discovered the next day but once again the investigators found no lead to the culprit. The third occurred on August 21, 1872. This time the murder was at noon and the victim wasn't a prostitute. Garayo was traveling to Gamarra Mayor when he met a 13-year-old servant girl walking on the opposite direction, who had been sent on an errand to Vitoria by her employers. Garayo seized her and hauled her off the road, oppressing her throat until she became unconscious, and raped her. He strangled her again until she died and hid the body in a ditch, returning to Vitoria by 2 pm. The discovery of the murder the next day caused a great commotion in Vitoria and its region. However, the doubled efforts of the investigators met again with a lack of leads, and even worse, with news of another murder only 8 days later, on August 29. At dusk, Garayo approached a 23-year-old woman not far from his own home, that he knew to be lewd, and offered her money for sex. The two left this time by the Portal de Barreras and advanced through the road to La Rioja, Garayo walking a distance behind her to prevent people from seeing them together. They reunited after a while and had sex next to a bridge. Garayo offered her two reales and after she protested, three and then four. She kept demanding more and he brought her down and strangled her until he thought she was dead. The victim, however, made a slight movement. Garayo then took her hairpin, straightened it, and stabbed her in the heart while holding her body under his knees. He placed the body next to the river and went back home during the night. The police investigated a soldier destined to Vitoria (the Third Carlist War had just broken out), but he was found innocent and cleared of suspicion. The panic among the population increased, with many women refusing to go outside alone and villages becoming deserted at night.El Sacamantecas, pp. 5‚Äì14 In August 1873, again during an afternoon, Garayo took another prostitute to the Recachiqui. Again he offered little money, she protested and he attempted to strangle her, but the woman could scream and alert some guards from Polvor√≠n Viejo ‚Äì the prison where Garayo would be executed later ‚Äì forcing him to flee. In June 1874, Garayo happened upon an old, sickly beggar woman on the road of La Zumaquera. Without saying a word, Garayo attempted to strangle her, but she screamed and defended herself until two other women arrived and Garayo run away. The victim identified Garayo and said that he was drunk and had tried to kill her for no reason, but nobody informed the police.El Sacamantecas, p. 21  Hiatus and possible imitators  D√≠az de Garayo would not act for four years after the second unsuccessful attempt. It was believed at the time of his execution, however, that his murders had inspired others to commit crimes in the Basque region:El Sacamantecas, pp.. 23‚Äì27 * On January 2, 1878, six years after the last successful murder, a 55-year-old woman was killed on the way back from Arechavaleta, where she had gone to buy wine. The murder was far more gruesome than any of the ones committed by Garayo: the victim was stabbed repeatedly on the chest and belly, disemboweled, and her right hand was severed. * On February 28, in the very same Vitoria, a 75-year-old man knocked on a house's door and when an 11-year-old girl opened it, he seized, raped and stabbed her several times in the belly with a razor, before abandoning the weapon and fleeing. The girl was hospitalized and identified her aggressor three times before dying on March 3. The man recognized the razor found as his own but denied having done the crime. He was found guilty of the last crime, but there was no evidence to link him to the others, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison which the Supreme Court of Spain overturned and changed to death penalty. He was garroted in Vitoria on May 19, 1880. * Right around that time, another woman was murdered in the countryside around Vitoria. The prime suspect was a shepherd seen in the city shortly before, who could not be found nor apprehended.  Second spree  On November 1, 1878, Garayo visited a mill outside Vitoria that he had been previously to and found the female miller cooking alone. After some words he tried to strangle her, but Garayo, 57 at the time, was overpowered by the woman and forced to flee. She denounced him and Garayo was arrested and sentenced to two months in prison. On August 25, 1879, Garayo left Vitoria through the road to Castile. Between the villages of Gomecha and Ar√≠√±ez, he found an old beggar woman and offered her alms. He then pushed her off the road; she fell and hurt her head on a rock. However, when Garayo jumped over her, she kicked him in the belly and he fell backwards. The woman got up and ran to Vitoria, screaming. Garayo followed her from a distance, and arriving in Vitoria he asked his fourth wife to speak with the woman and reach an agreement that would keep him out of jail. The victim wanted to denounce him, but eventually agreed not to in exchange for 20 pesetas (80 reales). Until the woman was convinced, Garayo cautiously left the city and looked for work in the Somorrostro mines, in Biscay. On the way back to Vitoria, on September 7, he latched to a 25-year-old woman from Zaitegui, Mar√≠a Dolores Cort√°zar,Olmos, Mart√≠n (2010) El destripador de Vitoria. Published in El Correo who had worked as a maid in Vitoria and began to converse with her. Once he was sure that no one else was around (a mail service employee had passed them and seen them talking together), he pushed her off the road, took her handkerchief and tied it to her neck, asking for sex and promising discretion and money in return. As the victim kept resisting, he threatened her and finally stabbed her multiple times in the chest with a razor. He raped her and then stabbed her in the belly again until she died. Bridge over the Zadorra river. Garayo hid the body and the food basket that the victim had been transporting, but rather than continuing to Vitoria he took a detour through the mountains where he was seen by a farmer looking for a cow, drank in a road inn called \\"Venta del Grillo\\", and slept under a bridge on the Zadorra River, in the vicinity of Arriaga. He woke up at dawn and had breakfast in an inn of Arriaga, but once again, instead of continuing to Vitoria, he returned to the bridge, left the road and climbed the hill of Araca. There he happened upon a 52-year-old farmer woman from Navarrete, Manuela Aud√≠cana,Olmos, Mart√≠n (2010) El destripador de Vitoria. Published in El Correo who had come to Vitoria for the festival and was going back home with some food she had bought. The two conversed until it began to rain, and sought refuge beneath a tree. Garayo, who had claimed at first to be looking for a lost mare, confessed his true intentions and the woman attempted to flee, but he seized her and strangled her with her own apron. He took off all her clothes, but found himself unable to perform. As the woman was still breathing, he stabbed her in the heart and the belly with the same razor used in the previous crime, then cut the belly open and extracted the intestines and a kidney. He cleaned the blood on his hands with the victim's clothing, covered the body, ate the food in her basket, and slept again under the same bridge. In the morning, he threw the razor in the river and cleaned himself before returning to Vitoria at last, changing clothes and leaving almost immediately for Alegr√≠a. The two bodies were discovered that day.El Sacamantecas, pp. 28‚Äì37  Arrest = 1879 crime investigation  The investigation of this last double murder was conducted by Judge Jos√© Antonio de Parada and involved Police agents in Vitoria and Guardia Civil in the near region. The Guardia Civil commander at Murgu√≠a (Zuia) heard the testimony of the mail service employee that had seen the first victim walking with a man, and interrogated the inn patrons and farmers of the region that claimed to have seen a stranger with the same aspect around that time. This description was sent back to Vitoria where the Alguacil P√≠o Fern√°ndez de Pinedo linked it to Garayo and his recent arrest for the attack on the miller. Pinedo also learned of the unsuccessful attack in August, from the victim, and shared his suspicions with Parada, who formalized the cause against Juan D√≠az de Garayo.El Sacamantecas, pp. 38‚Äì47 Pinedo took the arrest order to Garayo's home, where Garayo's wife said that he had left after the incident with the old woman and she had not seen him since (in reality, she had seen him briefly when he came to change clothes on September 9), that she did not know of his current whereabouts or the reason he had hurt the other woman. Garayo was at this time serving in the house of a farmer in Alegr√≠a, where news of the last crimes arrived shortly after Garayo did so himself. The farmer's daughter, a young child, reportedly told her father that the new servant was \\"so ugly\\", he \\"looked like the Sacamantecas\\".El Sacamantecas, p. 37  Arrest, trial and conviction  Garayo returned unexpectedly to Vitoria on September 21 and was arrested and taken to the local jail after being recognized on the street by Pinedo. There he was interrogated by Parada, but Garayo denied everything. He remained in jail for 12 days, this time being interrogated by warden Jos√© Fresco and key holder Juan Gim√©nez, and only admitted guilt and began to describe the crimes after they appealed to his religious beliefs and convinced him that it was the only way to obtain Divine Mercy. He started with the murder of the Zaitegui woman, which was transcribed by Gim√©nez, and later described the Araca murder to Gim√©nez and Fresco. On October 3 he agreed to repeat this testimony before the judge and his notaries, and he did so from 9:00 pm to 3:00 am adding further details. The next day he confessed the four other murders and four attempts to Fresco and Gim√©nez. On November 11, Parada sentenced Garayo to two death penalties and to give economic compensation, though only for the two last murders. Garayo remained calm when he received the sentence and asked lawyers Manuel Lete and Juan Echavarr√≠a to sign the sentences in his name, as he was illiterate. He then asked Gim√©nez for a stew, as he had not eaten meat that day, which he was conceded. From his conviction, Garayo wore shackles on his feet and was denied a shaving razor. He managed to shave himself with a lighted match at least once, but grew his beard afterward. Garayo also learned to read in the jail's library.El Sacamantecas, pp. 38‚Äì47  Appeal  Garayo's defense appealed the conviction to the Audiencia of Burgos, arguing insanity on the part of the defendant, and this ordered the court of Vitoria to have Garayo's mental state evaluated by as many doctors as possible, as well as to interrogate all of his friends and relatives on this matter. 11 Vitoria doctors were consulted, who determined on a report (March 3, 1880) that Garayo was not insane and had committed the crimes consciously. The defense asked for a second report, this time to the directors of the mental hospitals in Carabanchel Alto (Madrid) and Toledo, who on May 24 found Garayo to be \\"imbecile\\" and to have committed the crimes under the influence of a \\"partial madness\\" or \\"intermittent monomania, amidst long intervals of lucidity\\". However, the Supreme Court disregarded the appeal and maintained the sentence.El Sacamantecas, pp. 47‚Äì54  Execution  A garrote. Juan D√≠az de Garayo was garroted at the Polvor√≠n Viejo prison of Vitoria on May 11, 1881, by executioner Lorenzo Huertas, who came from Burgos.Olmos, Mart√≠n (2010) El destripador de Vitoria. Published in El Correo After his death, Garayo's body was exposed publicly for ten hours and buried at an unmarked grave in Santa Isabel cemetery, but the head is believed to have been separated during the autopsy, sold to a medical collection in Madrid and eventually lost.Diario de Noticias de √ÅlavaGamboa, Erlantz (2011) Enciclopedia del crimen y el sadismo. Leer-e, Pamplona  The Sacamantecas nickname  Representation of a sack man In Spanish folklore, the Sacamantecas (Spanish for \\"Fat Extractor\\") is a bogeyman-type character, often conflated with the child-targeting sack man, that abducts people to extract their body fat and sell it. Juan D√≠az de Garayo was called The Sacamantecas upon his arrest and conviction, and today is sometimes referred to as \\"the real\\" Sacamantecas, but he wasn't the origin of this legendary character, as it predates him, nor did he ever extract the body fat of his victims. The idea that the murders were the work of a Sacamantecas was actually a popular rumor that began prior to Garayo's arrest, when there was no known culprit. Garayo himself heard of this rumor, and his disembowelment of the last victim was a deliberate attempt to promote it. In the legends, the Sacamantecas were wandering traders, always outsiders, while Garayo was a local farmer. Through this attempt to \\"confirm\\" the Sacamantecas rumor, Garayo tried to throw suspicion off himself and the real reason of the murders, his sexual impulses.El Sacamantecas, p. 35. \\"Why this horrible act? <> answered Garayo more or less, when he was later asked several times about the motive\\" Though only Garayo came to be known as \\"The\\" Sacamantecas, other serial killers and child murderers in 19th and early 20th century Spain were claimed to be sacamantecas as well, such as Manuel Blanco Romasanta, Enriqueta Mart√≠ i Ripoll√©s and the 1910 murderers of the Sierra de G√°dor.Soler Cervantes, Milagros.

The story relates the fictional arrest of Garayo in Le√≥n and his travel back to Vitoria while being guarded by two Guardia Civil officers. In real life Garayo never left the Basque Country.

Explanations for these worsening conditions vary with analysis blaming strict price controls and long-term, widespread political corruption resulting in the under-funding of basic government services. While protests occurred in January, after the murder of actress and former Miss Venezuela M√≥nica Spear, the 2014 protests began in earnest that February following the attempted rape of a student on a university campus in San Crist√≥bal. Subsequent arrests and killings of student protesters spurred their expansion to neighboring cities and the involvement of opposition leaders. The year's early months were characterized by large demonstrations and violent clashes between protesters and government forces that resulted in nearly 4,000 arrests and 43 deaths, including both supporters and opponents of the government.\\"A total of 42 people, both supporters and opponents of the government, have died in the protest-related violence which followed.\\" \\"Venezuela: Leopoldo Lopez must stand trial, judge rules\\" by BBC News. Toward the end of 2014, and into 2015, continued shortages and low oil prices caused renewed protesting. By 2016, protests occurred following the controversy surrounding the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary elections as well as the incidents surrounding the 2016 recall referendum. On 1 September 2016, the largest demonstration of the protests occurred, with over 1 million Venezuelans, or over 3% of the entire nation's population, gathered to demand a recall election against President Maduro, with the event being described as the \\"largest demonstration in the history of Venezuela\\". Following the suspension of the recall referendum by the government-leaning National Electoral Council (CNE) on 21 October 2016, the opposition organized another protest which was held on 26 October 2016, with over 1.2 million Venezuelans participating. After some of the largest protests occurred in a late-2016, Vatican-mediated dialogue between the opposition and government was attempted and ultimately failed in January 2017. Concentration on protests subsided in the first months of 2017 until the 2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis occurred when the pro-government Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela attempted to assume the powers of the opposition-led National Assembly and removed their immunity, though the move was reversed days later, demonstrations grew \\"into the most combative since a wave of unrest in 2014\\". During the 2017 Venezuelan protests, the Mother of all Protests involved from 2.5 million to 6 million protesters. The 2019 protests began in early January after the National Assembly declared the May 2018 presidential elections invalid and declared Juan Guaid√≥ acting president, resulting in a presidential crisis. The majority of protests have been peaceful, consisting of demonstrations, sit-ins, and hunger strikes, although small groups of protesters have been responsible for attacks on public property, such as government buildings and public transportation. Erecting improvised street barricades, dubbed guarimbas, were a controversial form of protest in 2014. Though initially protests were mainly performed by the middle and upper classes, lower class Venezuelans quickly became involved as the situation in Venezuela deteriorated. Nicolas Maduro's government characterized the protests as an undemocratic coup d'etat attempt orchestrated by \\"fascist\\" opposition leaders and the United States; blaming capitalism and speculation for causing high inflation rates and goods scarcities as part of an \\"economic war\\" being waged on his government.Nicolas Maduro. 1 April 2014. Venezuela: A Call for Peace. The New York Times. Retrieved: 3 April 2014. Although Maduro, a former trade union leader, says he supports peaceful protesting, the Venezuelan government has been widely condemned for its handling of the protests. Venezuelan authorities have reportedly gone beyond the use of rubber pellets and tear gas to instances of live ammunition use and torture of arrested protesters, according to organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, while the United Nations has accused the Venezuelan government of politically-motivated arrests, most notably former Chacao mayor and leader of Popular Will, Leopoldo Lopez, who has used the controversial charges of murder and inciting violence against him to protest the government's \\"criminalization of dissent.\\" Other controversies reported during the protests include media censorship and violence by pro-government militant groups known as colectivos.

Background= Bolivarian Revolution  Venezuela was headed by a series of right-wing governments for years. In 1992, Hugo Ch√°vez formed a group named Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 aiming to take over the government, and attempted a coup d'√©tat.Uppsala Conflict Data Program Conflict Encyclopedia, Venezuela, War and Minor Conflict, In depth, Hugo Ch√°vez and the 1992 coup attempt, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=167&regionSelect;=5-Southern_Americas# Later, another coup was performed while Ch√°vez was in prison. Both coup attempts failed and fighting resulted in around 143‚Äì300 deaths. Ch√°vez, after receiving a pardon from president Rafael Caldera, later decided to participate in elections and formed the Movement for the Fifth Republic (MVR) party. He won the 1998 Venezuelan presidential elections. The changes started by Ch√°vez were named the Bolivarian Revolution. Late President Hugo Ch√°vez in 2010. Ch√°vez, an anti-American politician who declared himself a democratic socialist, enacted a series of social reforms aimed at improving quality of life. According to the World Bank, Ch√°vez's social measures reduced poverty from about 49% in 1998 to about 25%. From 1999 to 2012, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), shows that Venezuela achieved the second highest rate of poverty reduction in the region. The World Bank also explained that Venezuela's economy is \\"extremely vulnerable\\" to changes in oil prices since in 2012 \\"96% of the country‚Äôs exports and nearly half of its fiscal revenue\\" relied on oil production. In 1998, a year before Ch√°vez took office, oil was only 77% of Venezuela's exports. Under the Ch√°vez government, from 1999 to 2011, monthly inflation rates were high compared to world standards, but were lower than that from 1991 to 1998. While Ch√°vez was in office, his government was accused of corruption, abuse of the economy for personal gain, propaganda, buying the loyalty of the military, officials involved in drug trade, assisting terrorists such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, intimidation of the media, and human rights abuses of its citizens. Government price controls put in place in 2002 which initially aimed for reducing the prices of basic goods have caused economic problems such as inflation and shortages of basic goods. The murder rate under Ch√°vez's administration also quadrupled during his terms in office leaving Venezuela as one of the most violent countries in the world. On 5 March 2013, Ch√°vez died of cancer and Nicol√°s Maduro, who was vice president at the time, took Ch√°vez's place. Throughout the year 2013 and into the year 2014, worries about the troubled economy, increasing crime and corruption increased, which led to the start of anti-government protests.  First demonstrations of 2014  Protesters sign saying, \\"Why do I protest? Insecurity, scarcity, injustices, repression, deceit. For my future.\\" Demonstrations against violence in Venezuela began in January 2014, and continued, when former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles shook the hand of President Maduro; this \\"gesture... cost him support and helped propel\\" opposition leader Leopoldo L√≥pez Mendoza to the forefront. According to the Associated Press, well before protests began in the Venezuelan capital city of Caracas, the attempted rape of a young student on a university campus in San Crist√≥bal, in the western border state of T√°chira, led to protests from students \\"outraged\\" at \\"long-standing complaints about deteriorating security under President Nicolas Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Ch√°vez. But what really set them off was the harsh police response to their initial protest, in which several students were detained and allegedly abused, as well as follow-up demonstrations to call for their release\\". These protests expanded, attracted non-students, and led to more detentions; eventually, other students joined, and the protests spread to Caracas and other cities, with opposition leaders getting involved. Leopoldo L√≥pez, a leading figure in the opposition to the government, began leading protests shortly thereafter. During events surrounding the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempt, Lopez \\"orchestrated the public protests against Ch√°vez and he played a central role in the citizen's arrest of Chavez's interior minister\\", Ram√≥n Rodr√≠guez Chac√≠n, though he later tried to distance himself from the event. Corruption Corruption score according to the Corruption Perceptions Index (100 = very clean; 0 = highly corrupt). Source: Transparency International In a 2014 survey by Gallup, nearly 75% of Venezuelans believe corruption is widespread in their government. Leopoldo L√≥pez has said, \\"We are fighting a very corrupt authoritarian government that uses all the power, all the money, all the media, all the laws, all the judicial system in order to maintain control.\\" Corruption in Venezuela is ranked high by world standards. Corruption is difficult to measure reliably, but one well-known measure is the Corruption Perceptions Index, produced annually by a Berlin-based NGO, Transparency International (TNI). Venezuela has been one of the most corrupt countries in TNI surveys since they started in 1995, ranking 38th out of 41 that yearTransparency International, 15 July 1995, 1995 TI Corruption Index and performing very poorly in subsequent years. In 2008, for example, it was 158th out of 180 countries in 2008, the worst in the Americas except Haiti,Transparency International, 2008 Corruption Perceptions Index , accessed 30 June 2009 in 2012, it was one of the 10 most corrupt countries on the index, tying with Burundi, Chad, and Haiti for 165th place out of 176. TNI public opinion data says that most Venezuelans believe the government's effort against corruption is ineffective, that corruption has increased and that government institutions such as the judicial system, parliament, legislature and police are the most corrupt. According to TNI, Venezuela is currently the 18th most corrupt country in the world (160 of 177) and its judicial system has been deemed the most corrupt in the world. The World Justice Project moreover, ranked Venezuela's government in 99th place worldwide and gave it the worst ranking of any country in Latin America in the 2014 Rule of Law Index. The report says, \\"Venezuela is the country with the poorest performance of all countries analyzed, showing decreasing trends in the performance of many areas in relation to last year. The country ranks last in the surrender of accounts by the government due to an increasing concentration of executive power and a weakened checks and balances.\\" The report further states that \\"administrative bodies suffer inefficiencies and lack of transparency‚Ä¶and the judicial system, although relatively accessible, lost positions due to increasing political interference. Another area of concern is the increase in crime and violence, and violations of fundamental rights, particularly the right to freedom of opinion and expression.\\" Economic problems An opposition protester holding a sign saying, \\"I protest due to the scarcity. Where can we get these?' According to the 2013 Global Misery Index Scores, Venezuela was ranked as the top spot globally with the highest misery index score. In data provided by the CIA, Venezuela had the second highest inflation rate (56.20%) in the world for 2013, only behind the war-torn Syria. The money supply of the Bolivar Fuerte in Venezuela also continues to accelerate, possibly helping to fuel more inflation. The Venezuelan government's economic policies, including strict Price controls, led to one of the highest inflation rates in the world with \\"sporadic hyperinflation\\", and have caused severe shortages of food and other basic goods. Such policies created by the Venezuelan government have hurt businesses and led to shortages, long queues, and looting. Guatire, Venezuela on 13 March 2014. The Heritage Foundation, a US-based conservative advocacy group, ranked Venezuela at 175 of 178 in economic freedom and was classified as a \\"Repressed\\" economy in its 2014 Index of Economic Freedom report. More than half of those interviewed in a Datos survey held the Maduro government responsible for the country's current economic situation and most thought the country's economic situation would be worse or just as bad in the next 6 months of 2014. President Maduro has blamed the economic troubles on an alleged \\"economic war\\" being waged against his government; specifically, he has placed blame on capitalism and speculation. Shoppers waiting in line at a supermarket in 2014. An Associated Press report in February 2014 noted that ‚Äúlegions of the sick across the country‚Äù were being ‚Äúneglected by a health care system doctors say is collapsing after years of deterioration.‚Äù Doctors said it was impossible ‚Äúto know how many have died, and the government doesn't keep such numbers, just as it hasn't published health statistics since 2010.‚Äù Health Minister Isabel Iturria refused to give the AP an interview, while a deputy health minister, Nimeny Gutierrez, ‚Äúdenied on state TV that the system is in crisis.‚Äù Violent crime In Venezuela, a person is murdered every 21 minutes. In the first two months of 2014, nearly 3,000 people were murdered ‚Äì 10% more than in the previous year and 500% higher than when Hugo Ch√°vez first took office. In 2014, Quartz claimed that the high murder rate was due to Venezuela's ‚Äú growing poverty rate; rampant corruption; high levels of gun ownership; and a failure to punish murderers (91% of the murders go unpunished, according to the Institute for Research on Coexistence and Citizen Security).‚Äù InsightCrime attributed the escalating violence to \\"high levels of corruption, a lack of investment in the police force and weak gun control.\\" A protester with a sign saying, \\"I'd rather die standing than live on my knees\\" Following the January killing of actress and former Miss Venezuela M√≥nica Spear and her ex-husband in a roadside robbery in the presence of their five- year-old daughter, who herself was shot in the leg, Venezuela was described by Channel 4 as ‚Äúone of the most dangerous countries in the world,‚Äù a country ‚Äúwhere crime escalated during the administration of former President Hugo Ch√°vez and killings are common in armed robberies.‚Äù The Venezuelan Violence Observatory said in March 2014 the country's murder rate was now nearly 80 deaths per 100,000 people, while government statistics put it at 39 deaths per 100,000. The number of those murdered during the previous decade was comparable to the death rate in Iraq during the Iraq War; during some periods, Venezuela had a higher rate of civilian deaths than Iraq, even though the country was at peace. Crime had also affected the economy, according to Jorge Roig, president of the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce, who said that many foreign business executives were too scared to travel to Venezuela and that many owners of Venezuelan companies live abroad, with the companies producing less as a result. The opposition says that crime is the government's fault \\"for being soft on crime, for politicizing and corrupting institutions such as the judiciary, and for glorifying violence in public discourse,\\" while the government says that \\"capitalist evils\\" are to blame, such as drug trafficking and violence in the media. The United States State Department and the Government of Canada have warned foreign visitors that they may be subjected to robbery, kidnapping for a ransom, or sale to terrorist organizations and murder. The United Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised against all travel within 80 km (50 miles) of the Colombian border in the states of Zulia, T√°chira, and Apure. Elections Nicol√°s Maduro assuming office as President of Venezuela on 19 April 2013 On 14 April 2013, Nicolas Maduro won the presidential election with 50.6% of the vote, ahead of the 49.1% of candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski, surprisingly close compared to previous polls. Opposition leaders made accusations of fraud shortly after the election and Capriles refused to accept the results, alleging that voters had been coerced to vote for Maduro and claiming election irregularities. The National Electoral Council (CNE), which conducted a post-election audit of a random selection of 54% of the votes, comparing electronic records with paper ballots, claimed to find nothing suspicious. Capriles initially called for an audit of the remaining 46% of the votes, asserting that this would show that he had won the election. The CNE agreed to carry out an audit, and planned to do so in May. Later Capriles changed his mind, adding demands for a full audit of the electoral registry, and calling the audit process ‚Äúa joke‚Äù. Before the government agreed to a full audit of the vote, there were public protests by opponents of Maduro. The crowds were ultimately dispersed by National Guard members using tear gas and rubber bullets. President Maduro responded to the protests by saying, ‚ÄúIf you want to try to oust us through a coup, the people and the armed forces will be waiting for you.‚Äù The clashes resulted in 7 people killed and dozens injured. President Maduro described the protests as a \\"coup\\" attempt, and blamed the United States for them. Finally, Capriles told protesters to stop and not play the \\"government's game,\\" so there would be no more deaths. On 12 June 2013 the results of the partial audit were announced. The CNE certified the initial results and confirmed Maduro's electoral victory. The opposition's defeat in the 8 December 2013 municipal elections, which it had framed as a 'plebiscite' on Maduro's presidency, ignited an internal debate over strategy. Moderate opposition leaders Henrique Capriles and Henri Falc√≥n argued for 'unity' and dialogue with the government, and attended meetings held by the President to discuss cooperation among the country's mayors and governors. Other opposition leaders, such as Leopoldo L√≥pez and Marina Corina Machado, opposed dialogue and called for a new strategy to force an immediate change in the government.  Protest violence = \\"Colectivos\\"  Masked Venezuelan motorcyclists are often associated with colectivos. Militant groups known as \\"colectivos\\" attacked protesters and opposition TV staff, sent death threats to journalists, and tear-gassed the Vatican envoy after Hugo Ch√°vez accused these groups of intervening with his government. Colectivos helped assist the government during the protests. Human Rights Watch said that \\"the government of Venezuela has tolerated and promoted groups of armed civilians,\\" which HRW claims have \\"intimidated protesters and initiated violent incidents\\". Socialist International also condemned the impunity that irregular groups have had while attacking protesters. President Maduro has thanked certain groups of motorcyclists for their help against what he views as a \\"fascist coup d'etat... being waged by the extreme right\\", but also distanced himself from armed groups, stating that they \\"had no place in the revolution\\". On a later occasion, President Maduro issued a condemnation of all violent groups and said a government supporter would go to jail if he performed a crime, just as an opposition supporter would. He said that someone who is violent has no place as a government supporter and thus should leave the pro-government movement immediately. Pro-government colectivos fire upon a protest G√©nesis Carmona was participating in Some \\"colectivos\\" have acted violently against the opposition without impediment from Venezuelan government forces. Vice President of Venezuela, Jorge Arreaza, praised colectivos saying, \\"If there has been exemplary behavior it has been the behavior of the motorcycle colectivos that are with the Bolivarian revolution.\\" However, on 28 March 2014, Arreaza promised that the government would disarm all irregular armed groups in Venezuela. Colectivos have also been called a \\"fundamental pillar in the defense of the homeland\\" by the Venezuelan Prison Minister, Iris Varela. Human Rights Watch reported that government forces \\"repeatedly allowed\\" colectivos \\"to attack protesters, journalists, students, or people they believed to be opponents of the government with security forces just meters away\\" and that \\"in some cases, the security forces openly collaborated with the pro-government attackers\\". Human Rights Watch also stated that they \\"found compelling evidence of uniformed security forces and pro-government gangs attacking protesters side by side. One report said that government forces aided pro-government civilians that shot protesters with live ammunition. Human Rights Watch stated that \\"Despite credible evidence of crimes carried out by these armed pro-government gangs, high-ranking officials called directly on groups to confront protesters through speeches, interviews, and tweets\\", further noting that President Nicolas Maduro \\"on multiple occasions called on civilian groups loyal to the government to 'extinguish the flame' of what he characterized as 'fascist' protesters\\". The governor of the state of Carabobo, Francisco Ameliach, called on Units of Battle Hugo Ch√°vez (UBCh), a government created civilian group that according to the government is a ‚Äútool of the people to defend its conquests, to continue fighting for the expansion of the Venezuelan Revolution‚Äù. In a tweet, Ameliach asked UBCh to launch a rapid counterattack against protesters saying, \\"Gringos (Americans) and fascists beware\\" and that the order would come from the President of the National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello. Government forces Government authorities have used \\"unlawful force against unarmed protesters and other people in the vicinity of demonstrations\\". Government agencies involved in the use of unlawful force include the National Guard, the National Police, the Guard of the People, and other government agencies. Some common abuses included \\"severely beating unarmed individuals, firing live ammunition, rubber bullets, and teargas canisters indiscriminately into crowds, and firing rubber bullets deliberately, at point-blank range, at unarmed individuals, including, in some cases, individuals already in custody\\". Human Rights Watch said that \\"Venezuelan security forces repeatedly resorted to force‚Äîincluding lethal force‚Äîin situations in which it was wholly unjustified\\" and that \\"the use of force occurred in the context of protests that were peaceful, according to victims, eyewitnesses, lawyers, and journalists, who in many instances shared video footage and photographs corroborating their accounts\\". = Use of firearms = Lilian Tintori alongside Brazilian senators presenting a photo of Geraldine Moreno, who was killed after being shot in the face multiple times by Venezuelan authorities armed with birdshot. Government forces have used firearms to control protests. Amnesty International reported that they had \\"received reports of the use of pellet guns and tear gas shot directly at protesters at short range and without warning\\" and that \\"Such practices violate international standards and have resulted in the death of at least one protester.\\" They also said that \\"Demonstrators detained by government forces at times have been denied medical care and access to lawyers\\". David Vallenilla being shot dead by Venezuelan authorities in June 2017 The New York Times reported that a protester was \\"shot at such close range by a soldier at a protest that his surgeon said he had to remove pieces of the plastic shotgun shell buried in his leg, along with the shards of keys\\" that were in their pocket at the time. Venezuelan authorities have also been accused of shooting shotguns with \\"hard plastic buckshot at point-blank range\\" which allegedly injured a great number of protesters and killed a woman. The woman who was killed was banging a pot outside of her house in protest when her father reported that \\"soldiers rode up on motorcycles\\" and that the woman then fell while trying to seek shelter in her home. Witnesses of the incident then said that \\"a soldier got off his motorcycle, pointed his shotgun at her head and fired\\". The shot that was fired by the policeman \\"slammed through her eye socket into her brain\\". The woman died days before her birthday. Her father said that the soldier who killed her was not arrested. There has also been claims by the Venezuelan Penal Forum accusing authorities that have allegedly attempted to tamper with evidence, covering up that they had shot students. The article 68 of the Venezuelan Constitution states that \\"the use of firearms and toxic substances to control peaceful demonstrations is prohibited\\", and that \\"the law shall regulate the actions of the police and security control of public order.\\"s:Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela/Title 3#25 =Use of chemical agents= Multiple tear gas canisters on display following a 2014 protest Some demonstrations have been controlled with tear gas and water cannons. Some mysterious chemical agents were used in Venezuela as well. On 20 March 2014, the appearance of \\"red gas\\" first occurred when it was used in San Crist√≥bal against protesters, with reports that it was CN gas. The first reported use of \\"green gas\\" was on 15 February 2014 against demonstrations in Altamira. On 25 April 2014, \\"green gas\\" was reportedly used again on protesters in M√©rida. Venezuelan-American Ricardo Hausmann, director of the Center for International Development at Harvard made statements that this gas caused protesters to vomit. Some reported that the chemical used was adamsite, a yellow-green arsenical chemical weapon that can cause respiratory distress, nausea and vomiting. Image of a tear gas canister that expired in 2002, used during the protests Several tear gas canisters produced by CAVIM fired in 2017. Fabrication and expiration dates aren't shown. In April 2014, Amnesty International worried about \\"the use of chemical toxins in high concentrations‚Äù by government forces and recommended better training for them. A study by M√≥nica Kr√§uter, a chemist and professor, involved the collection of thousands of tear gas canisters fired by Venezuelan authorities in 2014. She stated that the majority of canisters used the main component CS gas, supplied by C√≥ndor of Brazil, which meets Geneva Convention requirements. However, 72% of the tear gas used was expired and other canisters produced in Venezuela by Cavim did not show adequate labels or expiration dates. Following the expiration of tear gas, Krauter notes that it \\"breaks down into cyanide oxide, phosgenes and nitrogens that are extremely dangerous\\". In 2017, Amnesty International once again criticized the Bolivarian government's usage of chemical agents, expressing concern of a \\"red gas\\" used to suppress protesters in Chacao on 8 April 2017, demanding \\"clarification of the components of the red tear gas used by state security forces against the opposition demonstrations\\". Experts stated that all tear gas used by authorities should originally be colorless, noting that the color may be added to provoke or \\"color\\" protesters so they can easily be identified and arrested. On 10 April 2017, Venezuelan police fired tear gas at protesters from helicopters flying overhead, resulting with demonstrators running from projectiles to avoid being hit by the canisters. =Abuse of protesters and detainees= Venezuelan National Guardsman holding a protester in a headlock. According to Amnesty International, \\"torture is commonplace\\" against protesters by Venezuelan authorities despite Article 46 of the Venezuelan Constitution prohibiting \\"punishment, torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment\\". During the protests, there were hundreds of reported cases of torture. In a report titled Punished for Protesting following a March investigation of conduct during the protests, Human Rights Watch said that those who were detained by government authorities were subjected to \\"severe physical abuse\\" with some abuses including being beaten \\"with fists, helmets, and firearms; electric shocks or burns; being forced to squat or kneel, without moving, for hours at a time; being handcuffed to other detainees, sometimes in pairs and others in human chains of dozens of people, for hours at a time; and extended periods of extreme cold or heat.\\" It was also reported that \\"many victims and family members we spoke with said they believed they might face reprisals if they reported abuses by police, guardsmen, or armed pro-government gangs\\". Amnesty International \\"received reports from detainees who were forced to spend hours on their knees or feet in detention centers\\". Amnesty International also reported that a student was forced at gunpoint by plainclothes officers to sign a confession to acts he did not commit where his mother explained that ‚ÄúThey told him that they would kill him if he didn‚Äôt sign it, ... He started to cry, but he wouldn‚Äôt sign it. They then wrapped him in foam sheets and started to hit him with rods and a fire extinguisher. Later, they doused him with gasoline, stating that they would then have evidence to charge him.‚Äù Amnesty International said that the Human Rights Center at the Andres Bello Catholic University had reported that, ‚ÄúThere are two cases that involved electric shocks, two cases that involved pepper gas and another two cases where they were doused with gasoline,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve found there to be systematic conduct on the part of the state to inflict inhumane treatment on detainees because of similar reports from different days and detention centers.‚ÄùUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein and relatives of those killed during protests discuss the crisis in Venezuela The New York Times reported that the Penal Forum said that abuses are \\"continuous and systematic\\" and that Venezuelan authorities were \\"widely accused of beating detainees, often severely, with many people saying the security forces then robbed them, stealing cellphones, money and jewelry\\". In one case, a group of men said that when they were leaving a protest since it turned violent, \\"soldiers surrounded the car, broke the windows and tossed a tear gas canister inside\\". A man then said that a soldier \\"fired a shotgun at him at close range\\" while in the vehicle. The men were then \\"pulled from the car and beaten viciously\\" then one soldier \\"smashed their hands with the butt of his shotgun, telling them it was punishment for protesters‚Äô throwing rocks.\\" The vehicle was then set on fire. One protester said that while detained, soldiers \\"kicked him over and over again.\\" The protesters he was with \\"were handcuffed together, threatened with an attack dog, made to crouch for long periods, pepper sprayed and beaten.\\" The protester then said that he was \\"hit so hard on the head with a soldier‚Äôs helmet that he heard it crack\\". A woman also said she was with her daughter when \\"they were swept up by National Guard soldiers, taken with six other women to a military post and handed over to female soldiers\\". The women then said that \\"soldiers beat them, kicked them and threatened to kill them\\". The women also said that soldiers threatened to rape them, cut their hair and \\"were released only after being made to sign a paper stating that they had not been mistreated.\\" Human Rights Watch reported that a man was going home and was attacked by National Guardsman dispersing a group of protesters. He was then hit by rubber bullets the National Guardsmen shot, beat by the National Guardsmen, and then shot in the groin. Another man was detained, shot repeatedly with rubber bullets, beat with rifles and helmets by three National Guardsman and was asked \\"Who's your president?\\" Some individuals that were arrested innocently were beaten and forced to repeat that Nicolas Maduro was president. NTN24 reported from a lawyer that National Guardsmen and individuals with \\"Cuban accents\\" in M√©rida forced three arrested adolescents to confess to crimes they did not commit and then the adolescents \\"kneeled and were forced to raise their arms then shot with buckshot throughout their body\\" during an alleged \\"target practice\\". NTN24 reported that some protesters were tortured and raped by government forces who detained them during the protests. El Nuevo Herald reported that student protesters had been tortured by government forces in an attempt for the government to make them admit they are part of a plan of foreign individuals to overthrow the Venezuelan government. In Valencia, protesters were dispersed by the National Guard in El Trig√°l where four students (three men and one woman) were attacked inside of a car while trying to leave the perimeter; the three men were imprisoned and one of them reported being sodomized by one of the officers with a rifle. In an El Nacional article sharing interviews with protesters who were arrested, individuals explained their experiences in jail. One protester explained how he was placed into a 3 by 2 meter cell with 30 other prisoners where the inmates had to defecate in a bag behind a single curtain. The protester continued explaining how prisoners dealt punishments toward one another and the punishment for \\"guarimberos\\" was to be tied and gagged, which would allegedly occur without intervention from the authorities. Other arrested protesters interviewed also explained their fears of being imprisoned with violent criminals. The director of the Venezuelan Penal Forum, Alfredo Romero, called for both the opposition and the Venezuelan government to listen to the claims of the alleged human rights violations that have not been heard. He also reported that a woman was tortured with electric shocks to her breasts. The Venezuelan Penal Forum also reported students being tortured with electric shocks, being beaten, and being threatened of being set on fire after they were doused in gasoline after they were arrested. Human Rights Watch reported that, \\"not all of the security force members or justice officials encountered by the victims in these cases participated in the abusive practices. Indeed, in some of the cases ... security officials and doctors in public hospitals had surreptitiously intervened to help them or to ease their suffering\\". Some National Guardsman assisted detainees that were being held in \\"incommunicado\\". It was also reported that \\"[i]n several cases, doctors and nurses in public hospitals‚Äîand even those serving in military clinics‚Äîstood up to armed security forces, who wanted to deny medical care to seriously wounded detainees. They insisted detainees receive urgent medical care, in spite of direct threats‚Äîinterventions that may have saved victims‚Äô lives\\". On 8 October 2018 the government of Venezuela announced that Fernando Alb√°n Salazar, who was jailed on suspicious attempt of assassination of President Maduro, committed suicide in prison, but friends, relatives, opposition members and NGOs denied the allegation.Venezuelan opposition denies jailed politician took own life Alban was arrested on 5 October, at Caracas international airport, when he was coming back from New York, where he had meetings with foreign diplomats attending the United Nations General Assembly.Opposition Venezuelan politician dies in jail Government's response to abuses The Venezuelan Attorney General's office reported it was conducting, as of the Human Rights Watch report, 145 investigations into alleged human rights abuses, and that 17 security officials had been detained in connection to them. President Maduro and other government officials have acknowledged human rights abuses, but said they were isolated incidents and not part of a larger pattern. When opposition parties asked for a debate about torture in the National Assembly, the Venezuelan government refused, blaming the violence on the opposition saying, \\"The violent are not us, the violent are in a group of opposition\\". El Universal stated that Melvin Collazos of SEBIN, and Jonathan Rodr√≠quez a bodyguard of the Minister of the Interior and Justice Miguel Rodr√≠guez Torres, were in custody after shooting unarmed, fleeing, protesters several times in violation of protocol. President Maduro announced that the personnel who fired at protesters were arrested for their actions. =Arbitrary arrests= According to Human Rights Watch, Venezuelan government authorities arrested many innocent people. They stated that \\"the government routinely failed to present credible evidence that these protesters were committing crimes at the time they were arrested, which is a requirement under Venezuelan law when detaining someone without an arrest warrant\\". They also explained that \\"Some of the people detained, moreover, were simply in the vicinity of protests but not participating in them. This group of detainees included people who were passing through areas where protests were taking place, or were in public places nearby. Others were detained on private property such as apartment buildings. In every case in which individuals were detained on private property, security forces entered buildings without search orders, often forcing their way in by breaking down doors.\\" One man was in his apartment when government forces fired tear gas into the building. The man went to the courtyard for fresh air and was arrested for no reason after police broke into the apartments.  Violent protests  Some protests have included incidents of arson, vandalism and other cases of violence. Apart from peaceful demonstrations, an element in some protests includes burning trash, creating barricades and have resulted in violent clashes between the opposition and state authorities. Human Rights Watch said that protesters \\"who committed acts of violence at protests were a very small minority‚Äîusually less than a dozen people out of scores or hundreds of people present\\". It was reported that barricades were the most common form of protest and that occasional attacks on authorities with Molotov cocktails, rocks and slingshots occurred. In rare instances, homemade mortars were used by protesters. The use of Molotov Cocktails in some cases caught authorities and some government vehicles on fire. President Maduro has stated that some protests \\"have included arson attacks on government buildings, universities and bus stations.\\" The National Guard alleged that they had prevented some violent students from the University of the Andes (ULA) from entering a premises. The governor of Aragua state, Tarek El Aissami, claimed that six opposition protesters were arrested for having firearms with one of the arrested being accused of allegedly shooting an officer with El Aissami saying, \\"He's a fascist. We ordered the Public Ministry and the entire judiciary application of all penalties\\"Diario El Periodiquito - Gobernado Tareck El Aissami repudia hechos violentos en Aragua The article 68 of the constitution also states that \\"citizens have the right to demonstrate\\" as long as it is \\"peacefully and without weapons\\". = Barricades = Throughout the protests, a common tactic that has divided opinions among Venezuelans and the anti-government opposition has been erecting burning street barricades, colloquially known as guarimbas. Street barricades, which stop vehicles from passing, violate the 50th article of the constitution of Venezuela, which grants the right of free transit.s:Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela/Title 3#16 Initially, these barricades consisted of piles of trash and cardboard set on fire at night, and were easily removed by Venezuelan security forces. Guarimbas have since evolved into \\"fortress-like structures\\" of bricks, mattresses, wooden planks and barbed wire guarded by protesters, who \\"have to resort to guerrilla-style tactics to get a response from the government of President Nicolas Maduro\\". However, their use is controversial. Critics claim guarimbas, which are primarily erected in residential areas, victimize local residents and businesses and have little political impact. A wall painting criticizing \\"guarimbas\\" A barricade built by protesters blocking a street. Venezuelans protest Nicol√°s Maduro's government in May 2017 President Maduro and poor sectors in some cities criticized barricades, with Maduro denouncing that ‚Äúthousands of people are affected by a small group of ten or twenty persons‚Äù, and that ‚Äúsome of them don‚Äôt have access to health care, including children and elders‚Äù,\\"A la pregunta sobre si la motivaci√≥n de las guarimbas es ‚Äúprotestar por unos problemas‚Äù, o sacar a Maduro del poder, 36,9% cree que lo hacen como protesta, pero 63,1% dijo que tienen como objetivo sacar del poder a Maduro. El porcentaje m√°s alto (78,7%) corresponde a los m√°s pobres, de las clases D y E. Como ven, en esos estratos socioecon√≥micos hay mayor conciencia de los verdaderos fines de la red de guarimbas, donde los niveles de rechazo son m√°s altos.\\" \\"Repudio a las guarimbas\\" at Ultimas Noticias although many opposition protesters argue that guarimbas are also used as a protection against armed groups, and not only as a form of protest. At some barricades, \\"guayas\\" or wires are placed near them. These wires are difficult for motorists to see and have reportedly killed a man on a motorcycle. Those who were protesting at the barricades claimed that the guayas were used for defense against Tupamaros and colectivos groups that had been allegedly \\"instilling terror\\" among the protesters. However, the government alleges that the guayas are placed groups of \\"fascists\\" saying that have \\"the sole intention of destabilizing\\". Contested statements claim that at least thirteen deaths had been attributed to opposition supporters at these barricades. It has also been reported that protesters have used homemade caltrops made of hose pieces and nails, colloquially known in Spanish as ‚Äúmiguelitos‚Äù or \\"chinas\\", to deflate motorbike tires.Hallan ‚Äúmiguelitos‚Äù y clavos en barricadas de Ciudad Ojeda: FOTOS+VIDEO The government has also condemned their usage. Some protesters have cited videos of protests in Ukraine and Egypt as inspiration for their tactics in defending barricades and repelling government forces, such as using common items such as beer bottles, metal tubing, and gasoline to construct fire bombs and mortars, while using bottles filled with paint to block the views of tank and armored riot vehicle drivers. Common protective gear for protesters include motorcycle helmets, construction dust masks, and gloves. President Maduro claimed that barricades had resulted in more than 50 deaths. = Attacks on public property = Public property has been a frequent target of protester violence. Attacks have been reported by Attorney General Luisa Ortega Diaz on the Ministerio Publico's headquarters; by Minister for Science, Technology and Innovation Manuel Fernandez on the headquarters of the nationalized telephone service CANTV in Barquisimeto; and by Mayor Ram√≥n Muchacho on the Bank of Venezuela and BBVA Provincial. Many government officials have used social media to announce attacks and document damage. Carabobo state governor Francisco Ameliach used Twitter to report attacks by the \\"fascist right\\" on the United Socialist Party of Venezuela's headquarters in Valencia, as did Jos√© David Cabello after an attack by \\"armed opposition\\" on the headquarters of the National Integrated Service for the Administration of Customs Duties and Taxes. The wife of the Tachira¬¥s governor Karla Jimenez de Vielma said the headquarters of the Fundacion de la Familia Tachirense had been attacked by \\"hooligans\\" and posted photographs of the damage on her Facebook page. In some attacks, institutions have suffered severe damage. In anger over Maria Corina Machado being teargassed for trying to enter the National Assembly after having been expelled, some protesters attacked the headquarters of the Ministry of Public Works & Housing. President Maduro said the attack forced the evacuation of workers and about 89 children from the building after it had become \\"engulfed in flames\\" with much of the building's equipment destroyed and its windows shattered. Two weeks earlier, the Tachira state campus of the National Experimental University of the Armed Forces, a military university that was converted by government decree to a public university, was attacked with petrol bombs and largely destroyed. The dean, who blamed far-right groups, highlighted damage to the university's library, technology labs, offices, and buses. A National Guard officer stationed at the university was shot dead days later during a second attack on the campus. Many vehicles have been destroyed, including those belonging to the national food distribution companies PDVAL and Bicentenario. Electricity Minister Jesse Chacon said 22 vehicles of the company Corpoelec had been burned and that some public property electricity distribution wires were cut down, the result of alleged \\"fascist vandalism.\\" The Land Transport Minister, Haiman El Troudi, reported attacks on the transport system. President Maduro showed a video of \\"fascist groups\\" damaging transportation vehicles and reported that 50 damaged units will have to be replaced. Vehicles affected by the attacks on land transportation belong to various organizations and bus lines including BusCaracas, BusGuarenas-Guatire, MetrobusGrupos antichavistas atacan a unidad de Metrob√∫s en San Antonio de Los Altos  AVN and the Caracas subway, with the consequence of the temporary closure of some transport routes and the closing down of stations of the Caracas subway to prevent damage. Timeline of events Number of protests in Venezuela per year. Thousands of opposition protesters outside of Palacio de Justicia in Maracaibo, Venezuela in February 2014 According to the Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict (OVCS), 9,286 protests occurred in 2014, the greatest number of protests occurring in Venezuela in decades. The majority of protests, 6,369 demonstrations, occurred during the first six months of 2014 with an average of 35 protests per day. SVCO estimated that 445 protests occurred in January; 2,248 in February; 1,423 in March; 1,131 in April; 633 in May; and 489 in June. The main reason of protest was against President Maduro and the Venezuelan government with 52% of demonstrations and the remaining 42% of protests were due to other difficulties such as labor, utilities, insecurity, education and shortages. Most protesting began in the first week of February, reaching peak numbers in the middle of that month following the call of students and opposition leaders to protest. The number of protests then declined into mid-2014 only to increase slightly in late 2014 into 2015 following the drop in the price of oil and due to the shortages in Venezuela; with protests denouncing shortages increasing nearly fourfold, from 41 demonstrations in July 2014 to 147 in January 2015. In January 2015, there were 518 protests compared to the 445 in January 2014, with the majority of these protests involving shortages in the country. In the first half of 2015, there were 2,836 protests, with the number of protests dropping from 6,369 in the first half of 2014. Of the 2,836 protests that occurred in the first half of 2015, a little more than 1 of 6 events were demonstrations against shortages. The drop in numbers participating in protests was attributed by analysts to the fear of a government crackdown and Venezuelans being preoccupied with trying to find food due to the shortages. In the first two months of 2016, over 1,000 protests occurred along with dozens of lootings, with the SVCO stating that the number of protests were increasing throughout Venezuela. From January to October 2016, 5,772 protests occurred throughout Venezuela with protests for political rights increasing in late 2016. Following the 2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis, and the push to ban potential opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles from politics for 15 years, protests grew to their most \\"combative\\" since they began in 2014. Following the Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election in August 2017, protests subsided for the remainder of the year. Into 2018, protests increased in numbers following the announcement of a snap election, which eventually resulted with the re-election of Nicol√°s Maduro. After the election, protests once again began to disappear. According to the Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict, by June 2018 more than four thousand protests had occurred in 2018, an average of twenty daily protests, of which eight out of ten were to demand social rights. Domestic reactions=Government Government- organized demonstration in December 2016 =Government allegations= Policemen from the Bolivarian National Police watching protesters in Maracaibo. In March 2014, the Venezuelan government suggested that the protesters wanted to repeat the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempt. President Maduro also calls the opposition \\"fascists\\". President Maduro has said: \\"Beginning February 12, we have entered a new period in which the extreme right, unable to win democratically, seeks to win by fear, violence, subterfuge and media manipulation. They are more confident because the US government has always supported them despite their violence.\\" In an op-ed in The New York Times, President Maduro said that the protesters actions had caused several millions of dollars' worth of damage to public property. He continued, saying that the protesters have an undemocratic agenda to overthrow a democratically elected government, and that they are supported by the wealthy while receiving no support from the poor. He also added that crimes by government supporters will never be tolerated and that all perpetrators, no matter who they support, will be held accountable for their actions, and that the government has opened a Human Rights Council to investigate any issues, as \\"every victim deserves justice\\". In an interview with The Guardian, President Maduro pointed to the United States' history of backing coups, citing examples such as the 1964 Brazilian coup d'√©tat, 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat, and 2004 Haitian coup d'√©tat. President Maduro also highlighted whistleblower Edward Snowden's revelations, U.S. state department documents, and 2006 WikiLeaks cables from the U.S.'s ambassador to Venezuela outlining plans to \\"'divide', 'isolate' and 'penetrate' the Ch√°vez government\\" and revealing opposition group funding, some through USAid and the Office of Transition Initiatives, including $5 million earmarked for overt support of opposition political groups in 2014. The United States has denied all involvement in the Venezuelan protests with President Barack Obama saying, \\"Rather than trying to distract from protests by making false accusations against U.S. diplomats, Venezuela's government should address the people's legitimate grievances\\". President Maduro also claimed that the government of Panama was interfering with the Venezuelan government. At the same time the Venezuelan government supporters commemorated the first year since the death of President Ch√°vez, the Venezuelan government severed diplomatic relations with Panama. Three days following, the government declared cessation of economic ties with Panama. During a news conference on 21 February, Maduro once again accused the United States and NATO of trying to overthrow his government through media and claimed that Elias Jaua will be able to prove it. President Maduro asked United States president Barack Obama for help with negotiations. On 22 February during a public speech at the Miraflores Palace, President Maduro spoke out against the media, international artists, and criticized the President of the United States saying, \\"I invoke Obama and his African American spirit, to give the order to respect Venezuela.\\" During a press conference on 18 March 2014, President of the National Assembly Diosdado Cabello said that the government accused Mar√≠a Corina Machado of 29 counts of murder due to the deaths resulting from the protests. Mar√≠a Corina Machado was briefly detained when she arrived at Maiquetia Airport on 22 March and was later released that day. The New York Times editorial board stated that such fears of a coup by President Maduro \\"appear to be a diversion strategy by a maniacal statesman who is unable to deal with the dismal state of his country‚Äôs economy and the rapidly deteriorating quality of life despite having the world‚Äôs largest oil reserves\\". The allegations made by the government were called by David Smilde of the Washington Office on Latin America as a form of unity, with Smilde saying, \\"When you talk about conspiracies, it's basically a way of rallying the troops. It's a way of saying 'this is no time for dissent'\\". In September 2018, The New York Times reported that \\"[t]he Trump administration held secret meetings with rebellious military officers from Venezuela over the last year to discuss their plans to overthrow President Nicol√°s Maduro.\\" Retired general Hugo Carvajal‚Äîthe head of Venezuela's military intelligence for ten years during Hugo Ch√°vez's presidency, who served as a National Assembly deputy for the United Socialist Party of Venezuela and was considered a pro-Maduro legislator, Also available online. \\"one of the government's most prominent figures\\" Also available online.‚Äîsaid that Maduro orders the so-called \\"spontaneous protests\\" in his favor abroad, and his partners finance them. =Arrests= VN-4s belonging to the Bolivarian National Guard on the street. On 15 February, the father of Leopoldo Lopez said \\"They are looking for Leopoldo, my son, but in a very civilized way\\" after his house was searched through by the government. The next day, Popular Will leader Leopoldo Lopez announced that he would turn himself in to the Venezuelan government after one more protest saying, \\"I haven't committed any crime. If there is a decision to legally throw me in jail I'll submit myself to this persecution.\\" On 17 February, armed government intelligence personnel illegally forced their way into the headquarters of Popular Will in Caracas and held individuals that were inside at gunpoint. On 18 February, Lopez explained during his speech how he could have left the country, but \\"stayed to fight for the oppressed people in Venezuela\\". Lopez surrendered to police after giving his speech and was transferred to the Palacio de Justicia in Caracas where his hearing was postponed until the next day. Human Rights Watch demanded the immediate release of Leopoldo Lopez after his arrest saying, \\"The arrest of Leopoldo L√≥pez is an atrocious violation of one of the most basic principles of due process: you cannot imprison someone without evidence linking him with a crime\\". During the last few weeks of March, the government began making more accusations and arresting opposition leaders. Opposition mayor Vicencio Scarano Spisso was tried and sentenced to ten and a half months of jail for failing to comply with a court order to take down barricades in his municipality which resulted in various deaths and injuries in the previous days. Ad√°n Ch√°vez, older brother of Hugo Ch√°vez, joined the government's effort of criticizing opposition mayors who have supported the protest actions, stating that they \\"could end up like Scarano and Ceballos\\" by being charged for various cases. On 27 February, the government issued an arrest warrant for Carlos Vecchio, a leader of Popular Will on various charges. On 25 March, President Maduro announced that three Venezuelan Air Force generals were arrested for allegedly planning a \\"coup\\" against the government and in support for the protests and will be charged accordingly. On 29 April, Captain Juan Carlos Caguaripano Scott of the Bolivarian National Guard criticized the Venezuelan government in a YouTube video. He said that \\"As a national guard member who loves this country and is worried about our future and our children\\". He continued saying that, ‚ÄúThere are sufficient reasons to demand the resignation of the president, to free the political prisoners‚Äù and said that the government conducted a \\"fratricidal war\\". This video was posted days after Scott was accused of plotting a coup against the government \\"joining three generals from the air force and another captain of the national guard already accused of plotting against the state\\". 225 Venezuelan military officers rejected the allegations against the three air force generals stating that to bring them before a military court \\"would be violating their constitutional rights, as it is essential first to submit a preliminary hearing\\" and asked the National Guard \\"to be limited to fulfill its functions under articles 320, 328 and 329 of the Constitution and cease their illegal activities repression of public order\\". The allegations against the air force generals were also seen by former Venezuelan officials and commanders as a \\"media maneuver\\" to gain support from UNASUR since President Maduro timed it for the meeting and was not able to give details. =Law enforcement actions= Altamira, Caracas. Protesters responding to tear gas on 12 March 2014. Personnel from the Bolivarian National Police and the Venezuelan National Guard were also seen firing weapons and bombs on buildings where opposition protesters were gathered. During a press conference, Minister of the Interior and Justice Miguel Rodriguez Torres denied allegations of Cuban special forces known as the \\"Black Wasps\\" of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces assisting the Venezuelan government with protests saying that the only Cubans in Venezuela were helping with medicine and sports. The allegations that members of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces were in Venezuela began when many people reported images of a military transport plane deploying uniformed soldiers alleged to be Cuban. In late March 2017, three officers from the National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela requested political asylum in Colombia becoming the first documented case of desertion since Maduro came to power. Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights OHCHR issued a report in July 2018 mentioning the excessive arbitrary arrests and detentions by the Venezuelan intelligence and security forces since July 2017.Human rights violations in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela:a downward spiral with no end in sight The report says that since 2014. There has been more than 12,000 arbitrarily arrests. From August 2017 to May 2018 alone at least 570 people, including 35 children, have been detained.Crackdown on DissentBrutality, Torture, and Political Persecution in Venezuela Venezuelan security forces have summarily executed many of anti- government protesters. =Resolution 8610= On 27 January 2015, the Venezuelan Minister of Defense, Vladimir Padrino L√≥pez, signed Resolution 8610 which stated that the \\"use of potentially lethal force, along with the firearm or another potentially lethal weapon\\" could be used as a last resort by the Venezuelan armed forces \\"to prevent disorders, support the legitimately constituted authority and reject any aggression, facing it immediately and the necessary means\\". The resolution conflicted with Article 68 of the Venezuelan Constitution that states, \\"the use of firearms and toxic substances to control peaceful demonstrations is prohibited. The law shall regulate the actions of the police and security in the control of public order\\". The resolution caused outrage among some Venezuelans which resulted in protests against Resolution 8610, especially after the death of 14-year-old Kluiberth Roa Nunez, which had protests days after his death numbering in the thousands. Students, academics and human rights groups condemned the resolution. International entities had expressed concern with Resolution 8610 as well, including the Government of Canada which stated that it was \\"concerned by the decision of the Government of Venezuela to authorize the use of deadly force against demonstrators\\" while the European Parliament demanded the repeal of the resolution entirely. Days after the introduction of the resolution, Padrino L√≥pez stated that critics \\"decontextualized\\" the decree calling it \\"the most beautiful document of profound respect for human rights to life and even the protesters\\". On 7 March 2015, Padrino L√≥pez later announced that the Venezuelan government was expanding on Resolution 8610 to give more detailed explanations and that the decree \\"should be regulated and reviewed\\". OppositionOpposition allegations= Mar√≠a Corina Machado and Lilian Tintori at an opposition gathering In an op-ed for The New York Times titled ‚ÄúVenezuela‚Äôs Failing State,\\" Lopez lamented ‚Äúfrom the Ramo Verde military prison outside Caracas\\" that for the past fifteen years, ‚Äúthe definition of ‚Äòintolerable‚Äô in this country has declined by degrees until, to our dismay, we found ourselves with one of the highest murder rates in the Western Hemisphere, a 57 percent inflation rate and a scarcity of basic goods unprecedented outside of wartime.‚Äù The economic devastation, he added, ‚Äúis matched by an equally oppressive political climate. Since student protests began on Feb. 4, more than 1,500 protesters have been detained, more than 30 have been killed, and more than 50 people have reported that they were tortured while in police custody,‚Äù thus exposing ‚Äúthe depth of this government's criminalization of dissent.‚Äù Addressing his incarceration, L√≥pez recounted that on 12 February, he had ‚Äúurged Venezuelans to exercise their legal rights to protest and free speech ‚Äì but to do so peacefully and without violence. Three people were shot and killed that day. An analysis of video by the news organization √öltimas Noticias determined that shots were fired from the direction of plainclothes military troops.‚Äù Yet after the protest, ‚ÄúPresident Nicol√°s Maduro personally ordered my arrest on charges of murder, arson and terrorism‚Ä¶. To this day, no evidence of any kind has been presented.‚Äù The student leader at University of the Andes marched with protesters and delivered a document to the Cuban Embassy saying, \\"Let's go to the Cuban Embassy to ask them to stop Cuban interference in Venezuela. We know for a fact that Cubans are in the barracks' and Miraflores giving instructions to suppress the people.\\" Opposition medic tending to a protester A female protester wearing a Guy Fawkes mask The opposition demonstrations that followed have been called by some as \\"Middle Class Protests\\". However, some lower class Venezuelans told student protesters visiting them that they also want to protest against the \\"worsening food shortages, crippling inflation and unchecked violent crime\\" but are afraid to since pro-government groups known as \\"colectivos\\" had \\"violently suppressed\\" demonstrations and had allegedly killed some opposition protesters too. Public opinion=Public support of protests Since the outset of the protests, peaceful daytime demonstrations advocating for policy changes and \\"redress of misgovernment\\" have received widespread support among the public. However, calls for regime change have been met with minimal backing while opposition leaders have struggled to win over politically-unaffiliated Venezuelans and members of the lower classes. =Support by the poor= The majority of protests were originally limited to more affluent areas of major cities with many working-class citizens thinking that the protests were unrepresentative of them and not working in their interests. This was especially evident in the capital Caracas, where in the wealthier east side of the city, protests widely disrupted daily activities, while life in the poorer west side of the city‚Äîhit especially hard by the country's economic struggles‚Äî largely continued as normal. The New York Times describes this \\"split personality\\" as representative of a long-standing class divide within the country and a potentially crippling fault within the anti-government movement, recognized both by opposition leaders and President Maduro. Later in the protests, however, many in Venezuela's slums that are seen as \\"bulwarks of [government] support\\" thanks to social welfare programs, supported the protesters due to frustrations over crime, shortages, and inflation and increasingly began to protest and loot as the situation in Venezuela continuously deteriorated. In some poor neighborhoods like Petare in western Caracas, residents that had benefitted from such government programs, joined protests against inflation, high murder rates and shortages. Demonstrations in some poor communities remain rare, partially out of fear of armed colectivos acting as community enforcers and distrust of opposition leaders. An Associated Press investigation that followed two students encouraging anti- government support in poor districts found much discontent among the lower classes, but those Venezuelans were generally more worried about possibly losing pensions, subsidies, education, and healthcare if the opposition were to gain power, and many stated they felt leaders on both sides were only concerned with their own interests and ambitions. The Guardian has also sought out viewpoints from the Venezuelan public. Respondents reiterated many of the core protest themes for their protester support: struggles with shortages in basic goods; crime; mismanagement of oil revenue; international travel struggles caused by difficulties in buying airline tickets and the \\"bureaucratic nightmare\\" of buying foreign currency; and frustration over the government's rhetoric regarding the alleged \\"far-right\\" nature of the opposition. Others offered a variety of reasons for not joining the protests, including: support for the government due to improvements in education, healthcare, and public transportation; pessimism over whether Maduro's ouster would lead to meaningful changes; and the belief that a capitalist model would be no more effective than a socialist model in a corrupt government system. =Protest coverage= Public support for the protests has also been affected by media coverage. Some outlets have downplayed, and sometimes ignored, the larger daytime protests, allowing the protest movement to be defined by its \\"tiny, violent guarimbero clique,\\" whose radicalism undermines support for the mainline opposition and seemingly reinforces the government's narrative of \\"fascists\\" working to overthrow the government in what Maduro described as a \\"slow motion coup.\\" An activist belonging to the Justice First party said, \\"Media censorship means people here only know the government version that spoiled rich kids are burning down wealthy parts of Caracas to foment a coup,\\" creating a disconnect between opposition leaders and working- class Venezuelans that keeps protest support from spreading. =Analysis of support= Some Venezuelans contend that the protests‚Äîseen as \\"rich people trying to get back lost economic perks\\"‚Äîhave only served to unite the poor in defense of the revolution. Analysts such as Steve Ellner, a political science professor at the University of the East in Puerto La Cruz, have expressed doubt over the protests' ultimate effectiveness if the opposition cannot create broader social mobilization. Eric Olson, associate director for Latin America at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, said disruption caused by protesters had allowed Maduro to use the \\"greedy economic class\\" as a scapegoat, which has been an effective narrative for gaining support because people \\"are more inclined to believe conspiracy theories of price gouging than the intricacies of underlining economic policies.\\" Poll and survey data Approval rating of President Nicolas Maduro. Sources: Datan√°lisis Luis Vicente Le√≥n, the president of Datan√°lisis, announced on 6 April his findings that 70% who supported the protests at their start turned to 63% of Venezuelan rejecting the form of protests. He also announced that the results of his latest opinion studies showed President Maduro at between 42% and 45% popularity, while no opposition leader surpassed 40%. Another Datan√°lisis poll released on 5 May found that 79.5% of Venezuelans evaluated the country's situation as \\"negative\\". Maduro's disapproval rating had risen to 59.2%, up from 44.6% on November 2013. It also found that only 9.6% of the population would support the re-election of Maduro in 2019. The poll revealed that the Democratic Unity Roundtable had an approval rating of 39.6% compared to 50% of those who disapproved it; while the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela had a 37.4% approval rating, and a disapproval rating of 55%. In a poll released on 5 May 2015, Datan√°lisis found that 77% of respondents did not intend to participate in peaceful protests, while 88% would not participate in protests involving barricades. Le√≥n attributed this to the criminalization of the protests, fears of government repression, and frustration over the protests' goals not being achieved. The poll also found that 70% would participate in upcoming parliamentary elections‚Äîa possible \\"exhaust valve\\" for channeling popular discontent‚Äîbut Le√≥n noted this represented weakened participation and that Venezuelans were preoccupied with economic and social issues. Media=Domestic media Protester holding a sign criticizing what the Venezuelan state media tells its citizens. The Inter American Press Association protested against the \\"official censorship\\" of media by the government in Venezuela which included blocking the internet, banning channels, revoking foreign media credentials, harassing reporters and limiting resources for newspapers. The Association of Foreign News Correspondents in Venezuela also accused the government of assault, abuse, harassment, threats and robberies of reporters. Media coverage in Venezuela has been limited by the government; \\"anti- government television stations such as RCTV and Globovision had their licenses revoked and were forced to undergo changes in ownership, respectively.\\" The government has, according to the opposition, \\"a powerful structure of radio stations, television stations and newspapers to have a communicational hegemony with their public funds\\" and does not provide reliable information from the Central Bank about the economy or any statistics about crime to journalists. On 15 March 2014, President of the National Assembly Diosdado Cabello announced a new commission called the \\"Truth Commission\\" whose establishment was ordered by the president in order to show videos and images of \\"where fascism is.\\" =Attacks on reporters= The Association of Foreign News Correspondents in Venezuela accused the government of assaulting reporters. The National Union of Journalists (SNTP) in Venezuela has said there has been at least 181 attacks on journalists in the first few months of 2014 and that there has been \\"82 cases of harassment, 40 physical assaults, 35 robberies or destruction of the work material, 23 arrests and a bullet wound\\" and that at least 20 attacks were performed by \\"colectivos\\". The National Institute of Journalists (CNP) stated that 262 attacks on the press occurred between February to June 2014. According to El Nacional, the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN) had raided facilities of reporters and human rights defenders several times. It was also stated that SEBIN occasionally intimidated reporters by following them in unmarked vehicles where SEBIN personnel would \\"watch their homes and offices, the public places like bakeries and restaurants, and would send them text messages to their cell phones\\". Foreign media According to The Washington Post, the Venezuelan protests in 2014 were overlooked by the United States media by the crisis in Ukraine. The Post performed LexisNexis searches of the topics in Venezuela and Ukraine within news stories from The Washington Post and The New York Times and found that the Ukrainian topics were nearly doubled compared to the Venezuelan topics. The Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights also said that, \\"Documenting the protests has been a challenge for members of the media and NGO's as the government has stifled the flow of information\\" and that \\"Journalists have been threatened and arrested, and had their equipment confiscated or had materials erased from their equipment.\\" Those reporting the protests feel threatened by President Maduro who has created \\"an increasingly asphyxiating climate\\" for them. Television stations in Venezuela have hardly displayed live coverage of protests and had resulted in many opposition viewers moving to CNN in 2014. Years later on 14 February 2017, President Maduro ordered cable providers to take CNN en Espa√±ol off the air, days after CNN aired an investigation into the alleged fraudulent issuing of Venezuelan passports and visas. The news story revealed a confidential intelligence document that links Venezuelan Vice President Tareck El Aissami to 173 Venezuelan passports and IDs issued to individuals from the Middle East, including people connected to the terrorist group Hezbollah. Censorship A sign reading, \\"Why do the Venezuelans protest? Insecurity, injustice, shortages, censorship, violence, corruption. Protesting is not a crime; it's a right\\". The secretary general of Reporters Without Borders said in a letter to President Maduro condemning the censorship by the Venezuelan government and responding to Delcy Rodr√≠guez who denied attacks on journalists by saying, \\"I can assure you that the cases documented by Reporters Without Borders and other NGOs such as Espacio P√∫blico, IPYS and Human Rights Watch were not imagined.\\" According to Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s, National Telecommunications Commission of Venezuela (Conatel) warned Internet service providers in Venezuela that they, \\"must comply without delay with orders to block websites with content contrary to the interests of the Government\\" in order to prevent \\"destabilization and unrest\\". It was also reported by El Pa√≠s that there will be possible automations of DirecTV, CANTV, Movistar and possible regulation of YouTube and Twitter. =Internet censorship= In 2014, there were mixed reports of internet censorship. It was reported that Internet access was unavailable in San Crist√≥bal, T√°chira for up to about half a million citizens from an alleged blockage of service by the government.\\"T√°chira militarizada y sin Internet luego de 16 d√≠as de protestas\\" (\\"T√°chira without Internet militarized after 16 days of protests\\") , Eleonora Delgado, Adriana Chirinos, and Cesar Lira, El Nacional, 21 February 2014. Retrieved 23 March 2014.\\"T√°chira amanece sin Internet por segundo d√≠a\\" (\\"T√°chira dawns without Internet for second day\\") , Eleonora Delgado, El Nacional, 21 February 2014. Retrieved 23 March 2014.\\"Venezuela: T√°chira se qued√≥ militarizada y sin internet\\" (\\"Venezuela: T√°chira remained militarized without internet\\") , Terra, 20 February 2014. Retrieved 23 March 2014.\\"Denuncian que en el T√°chira no hay agua, internet, ni servicio telef√≥nico\\" (\\"They claim that in Tachira no water, internet, or phone service\\") , Informe21, 20 February 2014. Retrieved 23 March 2014. This happened after President Maduro threatened T√°chira that he would \\"go all in\\" and that citizens \\"would be surprised\\". Internet access was reported to be available again one day and a half later. Social media applications such as Twitter and Zello are censored by the Venezuelan government as well. =State media censorship= During her speech at the National Assembly, Mar√≠a Corina Machado had the camera taken off of her while she was presenting those who were killed and while criticizing Luisa Ortega D√≠az saying, \\"I heard the testimony of Juan Manuel Carrasco who was raped and tortured and the Attorney General of this country has the inhuman condition to deny and even mock\\". =Censoring of domestic media= One threat a journalist faced was a note placed on her car by someone belonging to the Tupamaros. The note was titled, \\"Operation Defense of the Socialist Revolution, Anti-Imperialist, and Madurista Chavista\\" said that her actions \\"promote destabilizing actions of fascist groups and stateless persons who seek to overthrow the legitimate government of President Nicolas Maduro, probably financed and paid by the squalid and bourgeois right have burned the country\\". They gave the reporter and ultimatum saying they knew where she and her family stayed telling her to \\"immediately stop communication\\" or she would suffer consequences in order to \\"enforce the Constitution and keep alive the legacy of our supreme commander and eternal Hugo Chavez\\". A cameraman who resigned from Globovisi√≥n shared images that were censored by the news agency showing National Guard troops and colectivos working together during the protests. =Censoring of foreign media= The Colombian news channel NTN24 was taken off the air by CONATEL (the Venezuelan government agency appointed for the regulation, supervision and control over telecommunications) for \\"promoting violence\\". President Maduro also denounced the Agence France-Presse (AFP) for manipulating information about the protests. On 19 April 2017 during the Mother of All Marches, TN's satellite signal was censored after showing live coverage of the protests. El Tiempo of Colombia was also censored in the country during the day's protests. Social media CONATEL, William Castillo Bolle, giving the IP addresses and other information of Venezuelan Twitter users to SEBIN General Commissioner Gustavo Gonz√°lez L√≥pez. Social media is an essential tool for Venezuelans to show the news in the streets, which contradicts most official news from the government and most stories have to be compiled together from cell phone videos on small websites. The popularity of social media to some Venezuelans is due to a lack of trust, supposed propaganda from state owned media and alleged \\"self-censorship\\" that private media now uses in order to please the government. According to Mashable, Twitter is very popular in Venezuela and according to an opposition figure, \\"Venezuela is a dictatorship, and the only free media is Twitter,\\" Protesters use Twitter since \\"traditional media\\" has been unable to cover the protests and so that, \\"the international community can notice what's happening and help us spread the word in every corner,\\" However, the government has been accused of using Twitter as a propaganda tool when it allegedly \\"purchased followers, created fake accounts to boost pro-government hashtags, and hired a group of users to harass critics\\" and claiming protesters were \\"fascists\\" that were trying to commit a \\"coup d'√©tat\\". False media \\"The social networks have come to be an alternative media,\\" states Tarek Yorde, a Caracas-based political analyst. \\"But both sides, the government and opposition, use them to broadcast false information.\\" Some photographs, often outdated or from protests in various countries around the world including Syria, Chile and Singapore, have been circulated by the opposition through social media to foment dissent.Russo, Sandra (22 February 2014). \\"Las falsas fotos sobre Venezuela\\". P√°gina/12.\\"La oposici√≥n venezolana busca crear confusi√≥n con im√°genes falsas\\" . Info News. 15 February 2014. In an interview with The Nation, Venezuelan writer and member of the Venezuelan Council of State Luis Britto Garc√≠a referenced such photographs as evidence of the opposition's campaign to falsely portray the protests as having widespread student support when the protests instead involve, as he claimed, only a few hundred students in a country with 9.5 million of them. Usage of false media also applies to the government when President of the National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, shared a photo on a VTV program showing an alleged \\"gun collection\\" at the home of √Ångel Vivas, when it was really a photo taken from an airsoft gun website. Minister of Tourism, Andr√©s Izarra, also used old images of crowded ferries from August 2013 trying to indicate that life is back to normal in Venezuela and a massive mobilization of ferries are on their way to Margarita Island. Student protesters contested the statement, saying there is no Carnaval celebrations on the island and that \\"here there is nothing to celebrate; Venezuela is mourning\\". President Maduro allegedly played a video, edited specifically in order to accuse mayor of Chacao of promoting barricades.

Over the years, the story has become known for the excerpt‚Äî\\"arguably [Saroyan's] most famous saying\\"‚Äîabout the survival of the Armenian people after the genocide of 1915. Background William Saroyan was born in Fresno, California, to Armenian immigrant parents from Turkish (Western) Armenia. The Armenian community in Fresno‚Äîalready significant by the 1910s‚Äîgrew larger by the influx of genocide survivors and Saroyan grew up in an Armenian environment. In his 1935 story \\"First Visit to Armenia\\", Saroyan wrote that he \\"began to visit Armenia as soon as I had earned the necessary money.\\" Overview In the story, Saroyan tells about his encounter with an Armenian waiter he accidentally meets at a beer parlor in the Russian city of Rostov in 1935, en route to Soviet Armenia. The two Armenians, although from different parts of the world, speak Armenian with each other. This fact inspired him to write the story. In a personal note for the second edition (1943) of Inhale & Exhale, Saroyan calls \\"The Armenian and the Armenian\\" his favorite of the 31 selected stories. The excerpt \\"The Armenian and the Armenian\\" is best known for its last two paragraphs, in which Saroyan \\"unleashes emotional energy and praises the Armenians' ability to survive as a nation\\". The original text reads as follows: The quote is often modified; commonly, the phrase \\"see if they will not create a New Armenia\\" is added at the end. It remains unclear under what circumstances it was added. Significance and usage Over the years, this excerpt has become of symbolic significance in the Armenian diaspora, which was formed, primarily, as a result of the genocide. Various authors, including English travel writer Philip Marsden, Israeli writer Yoram Kaniuk, American playwright David Mamet, Iranian-born Armenian-American academic Vartan Gregorian, French military writer G√©rard Chaliand, Armenian-American criminal defense lawyer Mark Geragos, Armenian-American journalist Stephen Kurkjian, and others have used it in their works. In 2008, California state senators Dave Cogdill and Joe Simitian, along with California assemblymen Greg Aghazarian, Juan Arambula, Paul Krekorian, and Michael Villines proposed a bill which \\"would designate the year 2008 as the William Saroyan Year\\". In the statement, \\"The Armenian and the Armenian\\" was described as \\"an especially stirring declaration of solidarity... The words evoke notes of grief, rage, resilience, and rebirth, in relation to Armenian cultural and social life.\\" The quote appeared at the end of the 2016 film The Promise, a film about the Armenian Genocide. Film The story was adapted into a short film by Armen Karaoghlanian in 2010.

Jacobs is most recognized for her mixed media series that critically addresses issues of gender identity. In her humorous yet complex ensembles, she touches on the inclination of women to succumb to society's dictates and the tragedy hidden behind the \\"desire to be desired\\". Found objects like smashed glass, broken mirrors or objects from the sea are transformed into sculptures resembling animated foundation garments, corsets, bra's and shoes. Combining both elements of sexuality and comedy, her series provokes questions on the perception and image of women in society. Her work reflects a critical response to how the aesthetics influenced by the modern porn-industry and plastic surgery have created a dual and circus-like image of female bodies and sexuality. Jacobs graduated from San Francisco State University and attended post graduate studies e at the Academy of Art University and California College of Arts and Crafts.

The pictograph, which has deteriorated badly, depicts a human left hand; nearby flecks of paint from an unrecognizably faded figure likely indicate the site of the right hand.

She was known for having famous lovers including Georges Clemenceau, Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau, Paul Deschanel, Gaston Doumergue, Robert de Montesquiou, and Giovanni Boldini. Initially forgotten from history, her story resurfaced in 2010 after her belongings were discovered in her Parisian apartment, located at 2 square La Bruy√®re in the 9th arrondissement, untouched for decades. The discovery of her apartment was the inspiration behind Michelle Gable's novel A Paris Apartment. Early life and youth Marthe de Florian was born as Mathilde H√©lo√Øse Beaugiron on 9 September 1864 in the 18th arrondissement of Paris, eldest daughter of Jean Beaugiron and Henriette Elo√Øse Bara. She had two brothers who died as infants, Jules Louis Beaugiron and Jules Beaugiron, and a sister, Henriette Jos√©phine Beaugiron. On 12 October 1882, at the age of 18, she gave birth to her first son, Henri Beaugiron, whose paternity was unknown and who was born at 69 Rue Condorcet in the 9th arrondissement. Marthe de Florian stated on the birth certificate that her profession was embroiderer. Henri died three months after his birth. At the age of 19, on 7 April 1884, de Florian gave birth to a second son also called Henri Beaugiron, who was born at 100 Rue Saint-Lazare. He spent his life in Paris and died on 12 May 1966, while living at 2 Rue La Bruy√®re. While his paternity was also stated as \\"unknown\\", it is speculatively possible that his father was the married banker Auguste Albert Gaston Florian Mollard, a lover of Marthe, from whom she presumably took the name \\"de Florian\\" The Apartment Marthe de Florian's apartment is a 1,500 square foot apartment located on the fourth floor at 2, Square La Bruy√®re in the 9th arrondissement of Paris, not far from Sainte-Trinit√©. She died in the apartment in 1939. Her son, Henri Beaugiron, who witnessed and signed his mother's death record, was also living in the apartment at the time of her death.Death record of Marthe de Florian, shared by Gilles DuBois, 8 December 2014. The record is witnessed and signed by Henri Beaugiron, \\"homme de lettres\\", living at \\"2, Square La Bruy√®re\\". The apartment was eventually inherited by Solange Beaugiron, Henri's daughter, a playwright who sometimes used the pseudonym \\"Solange Beldo\\". During World War II de Florian's granddaughter, Solange, escaped from the Nazis and settled in the South of France, never to return, or at least never to come back to clear the apartment after her father's death in 1966. The rent and expenses were paid regularly until her death in June 2010 at the age of 91. As a result, everything the apartment contained, including many paintings, furniture and all the usual elements of early 20th-century life remained intact for several decades. According to death records, Henri Beaugiron died in the apartment at 2, Square La Bruy√®re in 1966. According to Marc Ottavi, the art expert who was present when the apartment was opened in 2010, there were papers in the apartment dated as late as 1955. The contents of the apartment, including the Boldini painting, were auctioned on September 28, 2010 The Portrait Among the many paintings discovered in the apartment was a portrait depicting Marthe de Florian herself in a beautiful pink muslin evening dress, painted by one of her lovers, the artist Giovanni Boldini. The portrait had never been listed, exhibited or published, however a visiting card with a scribbled love note from the painter was found in the apartment, and a short reference found in a book from 1951 commissioned by the artist's widow Emilia Cardona also confirmed the provenance of the painting. According to the auction expert, the work was painted around 1900-1910drouot.com.. After its rediscovery and subsequent research into its provenance, the painting was put to auction with a starting price of ‚Ç¨300,000, but the sale price rocketed as ten bidders pushed the final price to ‚Ç¨3 million, a world record for the artist.

The Haitian diaspora is present in virtually all of Switzerland, with strong concentrations in the cantons of Geneva, Vaud, Neuch√¢tel, Bern and Z√ºrich with roughly 20 associations present on the communal and cultural scene. Particularly in Geneva, a French-speaking canton, the Haitian community is made up of health professionals, artists, technicians, laborers, lawyers, entrepreneurs, employed students, diplomats and the involvement of local politics, and international civil servants. The small population of Haitians and their descendants have maintained a positive reputation in the country, excelling notably in several fields such as non- governmental organizations, hospitality and the medical sector. History The initial wave of emigration came in 1957, when Haitian nationals many of whom were among the intellectual elite or middle class were either exiled or sought to seek political asylum from Papa Doc, who became President of Haiti. Geneva was a popular destination by emigrants out of all the cantons, mainly due to the shared common language of French and its status as an international city within a country that was popularly known as a safe haven for peace and prosperity. In the 1960s, the Haitian population in Switzerland was 30, with roughly 21 being in Geneva according to national statistics. Among these in Geneva, they were either non-diplomatic international civil servants or students on a state scholarship and/or were afforded to them by their parents. In 1965, the number of Haitians in Geneva increased from 21 to 71 and then to 85 towards the end of 1980. This population increased to nearly 300 in 1998 and could be explained by the recruitment of Haitian nurses by the Swiss authorities in the 1980s who sought out a qualified workforce to deal with an insufficient number of qualified hospital personnel with 203 being registered as nurses in 1985. In 1989, Geneva had 213 Haitians, 102 of whom had a renewable residence permit, 89 already in possession of permanent residency, 21 international civil servants and mixed unions factoring into the equation. In 2009, the number of Haitians in Switzerland was estimated to be around 1,500 people, which included 500 with a valid residence permit, 800 naturalization cases since 1981, 180 adopted children (since 1980), 37 international civil servants and roughly 100 without legal status. In 2018, according to a representative of the permanent mission of Haiti to the UN, Pierre Andr√© Dunbar, the number of Haitians and their descendants has risen to 4,000. Culture Culture of Haiti in Switzerland has struggled to influence the country en masse due to the relatively small community of Haitians and descendants and the majority have assimilated into the society of Switzerland at-large. The Haitian cuisine is usually kept and maintained privately and not commercially, as not one restaurant currently exists in Switzerland.

Carradine plays a mysterious stranger who recruits young lovers in an illicit romance (Nelson and Fenn) to commit a crime spree in a futuristic police state, while promising them an avenue for escape. The film was executive produced by Roger Corman, who came up with the original concept. Due to a perceived lack of Peruvian qualities, it was better received by American than Peruvian critics. Corman's New Concorde co-produced and distributed it. After its Los Angeles premiere, it was released on VHS by MGM/UA.  Plot  In the fictional country Soleil, a brutal police state at war with Frodan, the government sets up a criminal, Hector, who walks into a police trap. Hector is captured alive at the behest of the police chief and is executed live on television after a brief show trial. Bone, who has recently lost his job at a cryogenics facility for not showing the proper respect to authority, meets Helen, a woman forced into prostitution at the government-sanctioned whorehouse. They are immediately attracted to each other and begin an illegal romance despite several close calls with the police. Bone's friend Creon becomes jealous of their relationship and demands that Bone share Helen with him; disgusted, Bone refuses, and they eventually come to blows over Creon's behavior. After he observes Bone and Helen engage in petty theft, a mysterious man named Jason offers them passage to Frodan if they will steal records from a secure facility disguised as a hospital. Although suspicious, they accept and successfully deliver the information to Jason, who attempts to delay their reward and talk them into further criminal acts. Frustrated and needing money, Bone and Helen rob a bank, quickly becoming the most wanted criminals in Soleil. Creon attempts to blackmail Helen, but she dismisses his threats; before Creon can attack her, Bone saves her and tells Creon that he would kill him if he weren't leaving Soleil so soon. After losing faith in Jason's promises, Bone and Helen recruit J.D. and Alexi to help them escape. On the run, Helen and Bone hide out in the plague zone, where they encounter Jason, who is revealed to be a government agent. Jason explains that the government long ago ended any major crime in Soleil, and it is his job to recruit citizens to go on government-sponsored crime sprees that validate the powers of the police state. Helen and Bone briefly take Jason hostage, then flee to a safer location, where they discuss plans to rob upper class citizens stored in the cryogenics facility and hijack military helicopters that Alexi can pilot to Frodan. Creon bullies J.D. into betraying Bone and Helen to the police, with whom he has made a deal. Bone kills his former boss at the facility, and Creon tries to take Helen hostage. However, the police arrive and betray Creon, as Helen warned him they would. Creon takes J.D. and Alexi hostage; when J.D. mocks him, Creon murders J.D. At the military base, Helen and Bone, who escaped the facility, free Alexi and use Creon as a distraction as they hijack a helicopter. Creon begs to be taken with them, but they leave him behind for Jason to kill. Alexi flies Helen and Bone to Frodan, where they triumphantly land and celebrate their freedom. However, Frodan appears deserted, and Jason is waiting for them at the airfield. Jason casually murders Alexi and a police witness, then thanks Bone for making his plans possible. Jason reveals that everything has been a lie: Frodan is a radioactive wasteland, and the war ended twenty years ago; the \\"plague zone\\" is actually radiation that has drifted to Soleil. Jason knows too much for his position to be secure, and the information that Bone retrieved for him is his insurance. Jason allows Bone and Helen to escape, telling them that their continued threat justifies Soleil's military expenditures. Jason goes back to Soleil, while Helen and Bone start roaming and walking Frodan's land, searching for a new hope.  Cast  * David Carradine as Jason * Peter Nelson as Bone * Sherilyn Fenn as Helen * Michael Shaner as Creon * Orlando Sacha as Alexi * Don Manor as J.D. * Jorge Bustamante as Hector Beeko  Production  Executive producer Roger Corman, who came up with the film's concept, recruited Peruvian director Luis Llosa to make a futuristic thriller; Jeffrey Middents recounts what he calls an apocryphal story in which Corman signed a deal with Llosa while Corman was briefly delayed in a stopover in Peru. The film was shot in Peru and used postmodern architecture to affect a futuristic style. The extras were students and instructors from The American School of Lima. Llosa said he focused more on art direction than dialogue, and he shot at night to disguise the low budget. The film was a co-production between Corman's New Concorde and Llosa's Iguana Films.  Release  Crime Zone was released in the United States by New Concorde in March 1989. MGM/UA released it on home video in May 1989. It was included in \\"Corman's Drive In\\", a subscription YouTube channel, in 2013.  Reception  Academic Jeffrey Middents wrote that Crime Zone was better received in the United States than in its native Peru, whose critics rejected it as a Peruvian film. Middents states that the film was not rejected for being a genre film but instead because it did not have any uniquely Peruvian aspects, especially with its cast of American actors. Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times criticized the film as humorless and grim, but he wrote that it rises above its low budget roots to become a competent Blade Runner clone. Drive-in movie critic Joe Bob Briggs wrote, \\"Sure, we've all seen this story before, but have we seen it with 1,000 Peruvian extras in shiny silver space suits? I think not.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:1989 films Category:1980s science fiction action films Category:Peruvian films Category:American films Category:American science fiction action films Category:English-language films Category:Dystopian films Category:Post-apocalyptic films Category:Films set in a fictional country Category:Films shot in Peru Category:Films directed by Luis Llosa Category:Films with screenplays by Daryl Haney ","title":"Crime Zone"},{"id":"41928263","text":"Nord Anglia International School Dubai, also known as NAS Dubai, is an international school located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

It was built by Savastokrator Vlatko and his father Duke Paskaƒç around 1354. The monastery, dedicated to St Nicholas the Wonderworker, lies at the end of the village of Psaƒça, 3 km from the Kumanovo ‚Äì Kriva Palanka Road, in Rankovce Municipality. It belongs to the diocese of Osogovo-Kumanovo of the Macedonian Orthodox Church.  History  The monastery church, the only remaining part of the original monastic complex, was erected around 1354 by Sevastokrator Vlatko and his father Grand Duke Paskaƒç, nobles of the Serbian Empire. In 1358, Vlatko donated his monastery to Chilandar, a Serbian monastery on Mount Athos.  Architecture  The church is in the form of an elongated cross in a square with a narthex built at the same time. It originally had two domes (following the example of Lesnovo monastery), but the one above the nave collapsed at some point, leaving the central part of the church uncovered. In the 19th century the church was repaired but the missing dome was never rebuilt.St Nicholas the Wonderworker ‚Äì Psacha, http://koe.mk/en/sv-nikolaj- cudotvorec-psaca/ The outer decoration is in alternate layers of bricks and stone with several double bay windows and some rustic sculpture. The original dedication of the church was inscribed in stone above the entrance but was destroyed during the Bulgarian occupation of Macedonia in World War One since it mentioned Emperor Uro≈° and King Vuka≈°in as Serbian rulers.  Fresco painting  The fresco decoration in Psaƒça ranks among the best of the mid-14th century. It was executed between 1366 and 1371. On the south wall of the narthex we see the endowers' composition with old Paskaƒç and his wife Ozra paired with Vlatko, holding a model of the church, and his wife Vladislava. In front of them stand their children (grandchildren) Stefan, Uro≈° and Uglje≈°a, while above them is the icon of St Nicholas to whom the church and monastery were dedicated. Facing this composition the artists painted young Emperor Uro≈° and, on his left, his co-ruler and designated heir, King Vuka≈°in of the Mrnjavƒçeviƒá family. These are the best representations of these important historical figures. Both the portraits of the rulers and those of the nobleman with their families are of great importance in studies of medieval costumes. Unfortunately, the inscriptions by the portraits were all destroyed by the Bulgarians during their occupation in World War One. The eyes of King Vuka≈°in and Emperor Uro≈° were also scratched during the same period.–°. –†–∞–¥–æ—ò—á–∏—õ, –ü–æ—Ä—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç–∏ —Å—Ä–ø—Å–∫–∏—Ö –≤–ª–∞–¥–∞—Ä–∞ —É –°—Ä–µ–¥—ö–µ–º –≤–µ–∫—É, –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ 1996, —Å—Ç—Ä. 200-201 The depictions of saints are done in strong colors, with much attention paid to psychological portraying.–í. –à. –Ç—É—Ä–∏—õ, –ì. –ë–∞–±–∏—õ-–Ç–æ—Ä—í–µ–≤–∏—õ, –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–∞ —É–º–µ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç —É –°—Ä–µ–¥—ö–µ–º –≤–µ–∫—É II, –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ 1997, —Å—Ç—Ä. 77 There is a cycle on St Nicholas and a composition Death of Mother of God, while in the apse is the customary Communion of the Apostles with Church Fathers underneath it.–ú–∞–Ω–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ä –Ω–∞ —Å–≤–µ—Ç–∏ –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞, —Å. –ü—Å–∞—á–∞, http://www.mpc.org.mk/MPC/psacha.asp Some of the frescoes were rebrushed in the 19th century.

Description Myosotis pansa subsp. pansa forms rosettes up to 200 mm across with flowering stems to 300 mm tall. Leaves are spoon-shaped, variable in size. The leaf blade is usually up to 35 mm long by 25 mm wide, covered with short stiff hairs that lie flat, with a petiole as long as the blade of the leaf. There are often several multi-flowered inflorescences per plant. Flowers are 10‚Äì15 mm in diameter, white with yellow scales around the throat. Distribution The natural range of this subspecies is west coast of the North Island from Bethell's Beach west of Auckland to Ngarupupu Point, Waikato. It is usually found with Celmisia major, the cliff daisy, and Myosotis pymaea in limited areas on the western coast of the WaitƒÅkere Ranges, as noted by Lucy Cranwell- Smith,1982, in her chapter on the Rain forest of the Waitakeres. (A second subspecies, M. pansa subsp. praeceps is found in northern Taranaki.) It usually grows close to the sea, within open forest or scrub, and more open habitats such as the base of cliffs. It is also however well adapted to garden use with vibrant green foliage and well presented white flowers (which appear over a long period in summer). Taxonomy Myosotis pansa subsp. pansa L.B.Moore was originally described as a variety. Based on morphological and genotyping evidence, it is now recognised as M. pansa (L.B.Moore) Meudt, Prebble, R.J.Stanley & Thorsen subsp. pansa. Cultivation Myosotis pansa subsp. pansa grows in a similar manner to the classic garden forget-me-not, insofar as it is a short-lived perennial which self-seeds freely once established. It is, however, superior to its European relative as its foliage does not become bulky and scruffy in the way that M. sylvatica does at the end of a season. Conservation status The subspecies is listed as Threatened - Nationally Critical on the 2017 New Zealand Threatened Classification for plants.

They are typically utilized as aesthetic lighting devices and come in a variety of shapes, colors and sizes. Flameless candles are designed to eliminate the need for an open flame, thus, reducing their potential as fire hazards. Appearance As a decorative element, the design of a flameless candle is relatively versatile. The body or \\"housing\\" of the device is commonly cylindrical, containing a battery pack and an often flame shaped LED light that rests at the top of the candle. Many manufactures use LED lights with an irregular twinkling or flicker effect to simulate the calming glow of an open flame. The body of a flameless candle can likewise be made of wax to enhance its resemblance to traditional candles. Because LED lights do not put out as much heat as a live flame, wax based flameless candles do not melt but, rather, maintain their original shape and size for future use. Functionality Some flameless candles are scented, serving as air fresheners as well as lighting devices. Others, designed specifically for outdoor use, incorporate features including integrated insect repellent. As the sun sets, an ambient light sensor, housed in the body of the candle, triggers a small fan near a fragrance compartment. Geranial or other repellents are then released. Additional features may include remote control light switches, integrated timers and air treatment apparatus. Safety Because flameless candles are illuminated by a small light bulb, rather than an open flame, they pose less threat as fire hazards and do not melt or lose their form over time. Nonetheless, the bulbs inside some flameless candles may heat up significantly. In a pediatric study conducted in 2013, it is suggested that flameless candles are a minor cause of battery related injuries in children. Close to 8 percent of batteries ingested by children were identified as having come from flameless candles.

Built in 1911, it originally served as the home of the local chapter (the first in Georgia) of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and was the second-oldest DAR structure in the United States. Historians believe parts of the home were brought from the park after the 1895 Cotton States Exposition was held there. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but was not given any legal protection by the city. A tree fell on the building during the mid 1980s, and it was again damaged by Hurricane Opal in 1995. It was listed as one of the state's most endangered historic places by the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation in 2011, and after having changed hands multiple times, was purchased in March 2013 by a person who later began to renovate the interior for use as a private home while preserving the exterior. During the February 2014 winter storm, most of the building collapsed, except for the front fa√ßade. The combination of snow, sleet, and freezing rain apparently triggered the disaster, which did not injure anyone since it was still vacant during renovations, and at night, with workers (and nearly all Atlantans) having stayed at home for the day due to the storm. The owner still intends to at least save the historic front when rebuilding. The remains of the building were demolished in April 2016.

History Beau Coup began in the year of 1983 as a recording project and performed under the name Pop Opera. They changed their name to Beau Coup at the end of 1984. The project was started by vocalist Tommy Amato (not to be confused with the prolific session drummer of the same name, also from Cleveland),\\"Local Drummer Tommy Amato‚Äôs Rock Relief Pays It Forward @HRRocksinoNP\\" @CoolCleveland.com Retrieved 3-11-2017. guitarist Mike McGill and drummer Eric Singer. Eventually, Amato invited keyboardist and songwriter Dennis Lewin to join the project while he was playing in a band called Jonah Koslen and the Heroes. In that same year after the Heroes disbanded, Lewin, Tommy's older brother Frank and Bill March joined the project. With the help from Henry LoConti, Sr. and Henry LoConti, Jr., proprietors of the Agora Theatre and Ballroom and the \\"Agora Record Label\\", the band released their 6 song EP titled Beau Coup, known as their (White Album) which featured mostly Lewin's songs. The first single released from that EP was \\"Still In My Heart\\" which was authorized for airplay by 98.5 WGCL's WNCX General Manager and Program Directors. The song became a top 10 record on the station. Subsequently Rock 'n Roll Records, a subsidiary of Scotti Brothers Records signed the band and the song was distributed by CBS Records in the year of 1984. Program Director John Gorman (radio) at WMMS also took great interest in Beau Coup and gave them extensive airplay and invited them to participate in many station events as well.() After much struggle with Scotti Brothers Records and after being released by the label, the Beau Coup \\"Born & Raised on Rock & Roll\\" album, CD, and cassette were finally released on the Amherst Record label in the USA and on A&M; Records of Canadahttp://www.dennislewinmusic.com/SweetRachelAMFactcheckWikipedia.htm and Europe in 1987. The song ‚ÄúSweet Rachel‚Äù written by Dennis Lewin, reached #53per Bill March on the ‚ÄúBillboard Hot 100‚Äù Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and received much radio and video play internationally. Other Lewin songs including ‚ÄúStill in my Heart‚Äù,Still In My Heart Video ‚ÄúSomewhere Out in the Night‚Äù and ‚ÄúBorn & Raised on Rock & Roll‚Äù Born and Raised on Rock and Roll Video were all picked by Billboard as ‚ÄúHot Picks‚Äù along with a video which was played on video shows in the US and abroad, including MTV and USA Video Hits. Although Beau Coup disbanded in the early 1990s, from time to time they reunite to perform for several special events. Because of the Beau Coup song \\"Jane\\" which Lewin wrote about the legendary rock music critic Jane Scott, they were invited to perform at her memorial service which was held at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio in 2011.

Battle  On 23 October, British operations began with the attack on four forts known as the Barrier Forts in the Pearl River.Behan 1859, p. 67 The Coromandel and Barracouta captured the forts with slight opposition, the first shot in the war being fired from the Coromandel.Kennedy 1900, p. 39 Rear-Admiral Michael Seymour, commander-in- chief of British forces in China, reported no British casualties and four or five Chinese killed due to an \\"ill-judged resistance\\".Papers 1857, p. 32 Afterwards, Seymour proceeded to Canton, where he found the Encounter moored off the city near the Canton Factories.Behan 1859, pp. 71‚Äì72Kennedy 1900, p. 40 He sent the Sampson and Barracouta to secure the free navigation of Blenheim Reach along the river. Both ships took possession of the Blenheim and Macao Forts without resistance. British sailor William Kennedy described the scene at the city: > The river was alive with every kind of craft, from the little sampan, > propelled by a single oar in the stern, to the heavy trading junk with her > single iron-wood mast and mat sails. Numerous flower-boats belonging to > wealthy mandarins were moored off the town, conspicuous by their gaudy > paint, and crowded with laughing girls, who kept up an incessant chatter as > they peeped out at the foreign devils!Kennedy 1900, p. 41 The next morning, Seymour proceeded down Macao Reach where he met the Barracouta. The Dutch Folly Fort opposite the factories and Bird's Nest Fort were taken quiet possession of, as were afterwards the two Shameen Forts commanding the passage. The captured guns were rendered unserviceable. A detachment of Royal Marines was landed to protect the factories, later reinforced by another party and some bluejackets (sailors). Advanced posts and field guns were stationed at the most important points, and barricades placed across the streets to guard against a surprise attack. On 25 October, Chinese forces attacked the pickets but were repulsed by the Marines with a loss of 14 Chinese killed and wounded.Kennedy 1900, p. 42 On 26 October, operations were temporarily halted, being a \\"day of rest\\" on Sunday. At 1 pm on 27 October, the Encounter opened fire from its stern pivot at Governor Ye Mingchen's compound (yamen) in Canton, and continued until sunset at intervals of five to ten minutes. At the same time, the Barracouta in Sulphur Creek shelled the Chinese troops on the hills at the back of the city. The British warned the inhabitants within the vicinity to evacuate themselves and their property, which was done later that evening. On 28 October, the British resumed offensive operations from the Dutch Folly, where they placed two guns in position. The shelling of the city walls, aided by a conflagration of a large portion of houses in the line of attack, helped open a clear passage between the Dutch Folly and the city walls for further operations. The next morning, the British resumed firing earlier than expected after the Chinese mounted guns opposite the Dutch Folly.Behan 1859, pp. 76‚Äì77 At 2 pm, a detachment of about 400 marines and seamen, aided by the Dutch Folly guns, breached the city wall. After blowing up one of the gates, they took possession of the city, and after inspecting the house and premises of the governor, re-embarked at sunset and retired to their respective quarters. Seymour reported that the Chinese troops offered little resistance \\"beyond a scattered fire from the streets and houses\\", from which two British were killed and twelve wounded.Behan 1859, pp. 81‚Äì82  Aftermath  After receiving no concession from Commissioner Ye, the British re-opened fire on the morning of 30 October to maintain the breach. The bombardment continued daily to 5 November from the Encounter, Sampson, and Dutch Folly, targeting the government buildings in the city and the forts in the rear of it.Kennedy 1900, p. 44 After Chinese war junks gathered under the protection of the nearby French Folly Fort, the British captured the fort on 6 November.Behan 1859, p. 98  Gallery  File:Canton River, 26 May 1841.jpgMap of the forts leading to Canton File:Interior of the Dutch Folly Fort, 1857.jpgInterior of the Dutch Folly Fort File:The Conflagration in the suburbs, Canton, 1857.jpgConflagration in the city  Notes  References  *Behan, T.

He governed as a tenente Trast√°mara, Faro (A Coru√±a), Viseu, and Seia, owned vast estates in his native land, and was a generous patron of religious institutions.  Biographical sketch  Bermudo was never honored with the title of count, although he was an important magnate and appears in charters signing as dominus (Latin for \\"lord\\") and also as Vermudo Petriz Galleciae (\\"Bermudo P√©rez of Galicia\\"). His presence in medieval documentation is first recorded on 1 April 1104 when, with his brother, Count Fernando P√©rez de Traba, he made a donation to the Monastery de San Xo√°n de Caaveiro. He was a vassal of Queen Urraca of Le√≥n and, with his brothers, swore his loyalty to her son Alfonso VII upon his ascension to the throne of the Kingdom of Le√≥n in Zamora. On 29 July 1118, Queen Urraca, with the consent of her son Alfonso, returned to Bermudo and to his brother Fernando the territories belonging to the monastery at Sobrado which King Ferdinand I had taken by force in 1050.\\"Ego Urraca regina hispanie ...uobis Beremundo Petri et fratre vestro Ferdinando Petri, damus Monasterium Superado (...) quod possedit auuus meus Ferdinandus Rex et uxor eius regina domina Sancia de auo vestro Segeredo Aloiti et uxore eius Adosinda.\\" Segeredo and Adosinda were the maternal great-grandparents of Bermudo's mother, Urraca Froilaz. In gratitude Bermudo and Fernando made a gift of a hound named Ulgar and a hunting spear to Alfonso VII. A few years later, on 25 July 1122, he granted his wife Urraca several properties, including the estates in Las Cascas plus another three villages and two monasteries. Two years later, in 1125, he appears in Portugal confirming a donation made by Countess Theresa, as lord or governor of Viseu while his brother appears as the governor of Coimbra. After the death of Theresa, Countess of Portugal, on 11 November 1130, he participated in the uprising from his castle in Seia, although his brother-in-law, King Afonso Henriques, forced him to desist and Bermudo returned to Galicia, rarely crossing the Mi√±o River thereafter. On 9 October 1138, he rebuilt the Monastery of Genrozo, later known as Nuestra Se√±ora de las Due√±as, and finally as Las Cascas. It was most probably founded by Froila Berm√∫dez, Bermudo's grandfather. He had inherited half of the monastery from his father, Pedro Fr√≥ilaz, and King Alfonso VII, who had been raised with Bermudo since Pedro had been his tutor, returned the other half of the monastery which Pedro Fr√≥ilaz had given him, so that Bermudo would have the entire property. He gave the monastery to his daughter Urraca (the elder) who entered the convent as a nun and later became its abbess. On 8 September 1145, Urraca, with the consent of her father, donated it to the Monastery of Sobrado. The monastery, now in ruins with only the church of San Pelayo de Genrozo standing, was situated in the territory of Nendos, in a small village known as Las Cascas, close to the city of Betanzos. According to the Chronicon Lusitanum, a Portuguese source, Bermudo was one of the nobles taken as a captive after the Battle of Valdevez in 1140. He and his brother Fernando made many donations to the monastery at Sobrado, which had been founded by their ancestors, and owned all its estates over a period of 24 years, from 1118 until 11 January 1142 when they voluntarily handed it over to the Cistercian monks. He went twice on pilgrimages to the Holy Land; the first time in 1147 with his brother Fernando and cousin Menendo Rodr√≠guez returning to Galicia in 1148. He went again on his own in 1153 and was back in Galicia the next year as attested in a document recording the sale made by Adosinda Rodr√≠guez of a property in Sobrado on 24 April 1155 which is dated, ipso anno presente, quando domnus Vermudis reversus est Hierosalime (when Don Bermudo was back from Jerusalem). In 1148, he entrusted the abbot at the Benedictine monastery of Toxos Outos with the construction of a convent in Nogueirosa, one of the estates that he had given his wife Urraca as part of her wedding tokens on 25 July 1122. Years later, in 1150, Urraca made a donation of several properties to the newly founded establishment under the condition that she and four female relatives were to be accepted as members of the religious community of this convent which was called Santa Mar√≠a de Nogueirosa. In December 1156 he made his last recorded visit to the royal court at Palencia. Sobrado Abbey where Bermudo retired and was buriedl On 6 August 1160, Bermudo retired as a Cistercian monk at the Monastery of Sobrado dos Monges. On 21 September 1161, Bermudo settled a dispute he had with the monks of Toxos Outos. In this charter he describes himself as \\"moved by divine inspiration\\" (\\"diuina inspiratione conmotus\\") to become a monk. He died in 1168 when he was approximately 80 years old and was buried at the abbey. At about the same time as her husband became a monk at Sobrado, Urraca entered the convent founded by her husband in Nogueirosa, a parish near Pontedeume, and died in 1173, receiving burial at the church in the convent.  Marriage and issue  He married on more than one occasion, as he himself declares in a document dated 9 October 1138 when he made a donation to his daughter Urraca, a nun and later abbess at the Monastery of Cascas.\\"...uma cum filiis et filiabus nostris et cum √≥mnibus filiis et filiabus quos de uxoribus meis prioribus habui...\\" (with our sons and daughters and with all the sons and daughters that I had with my previous wives). He had three children from one of his first wives, Teresa Berm√∫dez: * Pedro Berm√∫dez (died in 1147), in 1147 his father made a donation to the Sobrado for the soul of his son. * Enrique Berm√∫dez (died after 1151) * Mayor Berm√∫dez (died after 1192), was the wife of the Portuguese noble, Gon√ßalo Mendes, son of Mem Rodrigues de Tougues and Chamoa Gomes.

The offspring of this marriage were: * Fernando Berm√∫dez (died after 1161), who appears frequently in the Kingdom of Portugal confirming charters of his uncle King Afonso Henriques. * Urraca Berm√∫dez \\"the eldest\\", a nun and abbess at the Monastery of Cascas. * Suero Berm√∫dez (died in 1169), buried at the Monastery of Sobrado. * Teresa Berm√∫dez (died c. 1219), buried also at Sobrado, she married the Galician magnate Fernando Arias, Lord of Batisela, with whom she had several children, including Juan Fern√°ndez, mayordomo mayor and alf√©rez of King Alfonso IX of Le√≥n. * Sancha Berm√∫dez (died. c. 1208), in 1152, she married Soeiro Viegas de Riba Douro, governor of Lamego and son of Egas Moniz, Aio. One of her sons, Louren√ßo Soares was the husband of Urraca Sanches, illegitimate daughter of King Sancho I of Portugal. * Urraca Berm√∫dez \\"the younger\\" (died after 1196), she was still alive in 1196 when she confirmed a charter in the Monastery of Sobrado as domna Urraca Ueremude filia domni Ueremudi Petri.

Plot  A pair of Mafiosos try to confront Roger Amsford and his wife at a lounge, wanting to discuss a $20,000 debt Roger owes, but the Amsfords evade them. The men follow the Amsfords to their home, and as his associate beats Roger, Spike rapes Mrs. Amsford. On the way out Spike and his partner assault Roger's father, Gen. William Amsford, a former member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Taking matters into his own hands, the general has Louise Tyler, his assistant, bring him discharged Ranger Capt. Joseph Napoli, a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor. Having concluded that regular law enforcement is ineffective against organized crime, Gen. Amsford offers Joe the chance to lead a covert and government-sanctioned assault on the Mafia. Joe accepts the job, partly due to having grown up fearing the mob, which killed his uncle by \\"splitting him in half on a railroad track\\". At a villa, local mob leader Tony Mandano punishes Spike for raping Mrs. Amsford by forcing him to have sex with one of his gun molls; if Spike can abstain from having an orgasm before the girl does, he will not be killed for his insubordination. Spike is unable to restrain himself, and is shot as the onlooking mobsters applaud. For his first assignment Joe follows Roger to the desolate road where he is going to deliver the money he owes. After Roger pays a pair of thugs, Joe shoots them. Joe and his squad proceed to travel from city to city, wiping out mobsters as the Attorney General repeatedly denies that the assassinations are being directed by the Department of Justice. An affiliate informs Mandano of Gen. Amsford's involvement in the killings, and when Joe and his team attack Mandano's villa, the mob boss ambushes Joe. Joe and Mandano fight, and Joe emerges victorious, beating Mandano to death with his bare hands. Joe, who had been courting Louise throughout the film, celebrates Mandano's death by having sex with her, after the two make plans to elope. Afterward, there is a knock at the door, and when Joe answers it, he is shot to death as Louise screams.

Dhanraj Giri (1811-1901) was the abbot of Kailash Ashram, an ashram, which he established in 1880 at Muni Ki Reti, Rishikesh. It was one of the first large ashrams to be established in Rishikesh, prior to which it was mostly as a place for individual seekers, or pilgrims to stop over on way to Char Dham temples pilgrimage. He was a famous monk in Northern India and was a scholar in Vedanta philosophy. He was well acquainted with spiritual luminaries of nineteenth century India like Swami Vivekananda. Biography and legacy Dhanraj Giri as part of his wanderings had come to Rishikesh from Varanasi and had put up in Surat Giri Bangla ashram in Kankhal. Subsequently, he started an open-air education centre for Vedanta studies to which many students joined. In 1880, the king of Tehri region granted him a piece of land for setting up an ashram and a university for studying ancient Indian scriptures, especially Vedanta. This monastery came to be known as Kailash Ashram. Swami Vivekananda, as part of his travels in North India, went to Rishikesh and also went to Kailash Ashrama. Giri was a prominent Advaita Vedantist of the period, and Swami Abhedananda, another prominent monastic disciple of Ramakrishna studied Vedanta in Kailsha Ashrama under Dhanraj Giri as a resident student for many months. In the early part of twentieth century, when the two monastic disciples of Vivekananda, Kalyanananda and Nischayananda, had established the Ramakrishna Mission Sevashrama, Kankhal, they faced discrimination in the hands of local orthodox monks for their service to the sick and poor, as such activities were considered of low grade by orthodox monks. Dhanraj Giri, who wielded considerable influence among the monks and who regularly used to feed the monks from his Ashrama, provided full support to the service activities conducted by the two disciples of Swami Vivekananda and gave them special respect and importance in front of all other monks, which gradually ensured the acceptance of their work in the wider community. Today, the ashram he established continues to be a noted centre for exegesis of Hindu shastras, and Vedantic study and scholarship.

She is known for one of her books, From Novice to Expert: Excellence and Power in Clinical Nursing Practice (1984). Benner described the stages of learning and skill acquisition across the careers of nurses, applying the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition to nursing practice. Benner is a professor emerita at the University of California, San Francisco UCSF School of Nursing. Early life Benner was born Patricia Sawyer in August 1942 in Hampton, Virginia. Benner, her parents and her two sisters moved to California when she was a child. Her parents were divorced when she was in high school, which she described as a difficult event for her entire family. Benner decided to become a nurse while working in a hospital admitting department during college. She earned an associate degree in nursing from Pasadena City College simultaneously with a bachelor's degree from Pasadena College in 1964. She married Richard Benner in 1967 and they had two children. Benner earned a master's degree in nursing from UCSF in 1970 and a PhD from the University of California, Berkeley in 1982. Academic career Benner joined the nursing faculty at UCSF in 1982. Early in her academic career, Benner led the Achieving Methods of Intraprofessional Consensus, Assessment and Evaluation Project (AMICAE Project). She held an endowed chair at UCSF in ethics and spirituality for several years. In 2004, she became director of the Preparation for the Profession program at the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Benner is a professor emerita at the UCSF School of Nursing and is a program leader with the school's PhD program in nursing health policy. She wrote her influential book, From Novice to Expert: Excellence and Power in Clinical Nursing Practice, in 1984, based on her work with the AMICAE Project. Benner adapted the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition to the careers of nurses. The work describes a five-stage career trajectory from novice nurse to expert. Benner's model was based on qualitative research rather than quantitative studies, which has opened it to some criticism. Working with Judith Wrubel in 1989, Benner expanded her model to incorporate the concept of caring with the stages of skill acquisition. In addition to the influence of the Dreyfus model, the new model was inspired by the work of philosophers Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Martin Heidegger. It described four aspects of a person's understanding (the role of the situation, the role of the body, the role of temporal concerns, and the role of temporality), as well as five dimensions of the body to which nurses attend. Benner was named a Living Legend of the American Academy of Nursing in 2011. The Living Legends designation honors individuals with \\"extraordinary contributions to the nursing profession, sustained over the course of their careers.\\" Along with her most renowned book she also has written, Expertise in Nursing Practice: Caring, Clinical Judgement and Ethics, Clinical Wisdom and Interventions in Critical Care: A thinking-In-action Approach, and, Stress and Satisfaction on the Job: Work Meanings and Coping of Mid-Career Men.  From novice to expert: A nursing theory  Benner's novice to expert theory asserts that expert nurses develop their knowledge of patient care and extensive skill set by obtaining experiences collected over a course of time as well as having an education background. Dr. Benner's theory focuses on how nurses acquire their nursing knowledge, particularly how a nurse could gain knowledge or \\"know-how\\" without learning a theory, referred to as \\"know-that\\".Petiprin, A. (2015). From Novice to Expert. Nursing Theory.org. Retrieved March 28, 2016 from: http://www.nursing-theory.org/theories-and-models/from-novice-to-expert.php The novice to expert process is one of skill acquisition and is supported as well as defined by the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition, which acts as a foundation for the theory. This model demonstrates how students gain knowledge or skills. Benner applies this theory to the nursing profession by outlining the same five stages or levels of clinical competency: novice, advanced beginner, competent, proficient, and expert. These five levels represent an overall change in two aspects of a nurse's skills, increased independence in reliance on abstract ideas and principles and an increase in critical thinking. As one collects more concrete experiences, they are then able to use these as paradigms rather than abstract principles, which also leads to an increase in critical thinking. Experiences gained over time will enable a change in perception. Such a change in perception will then open up a new level of thinking that is based on each situation and is more holistic, rather than abstract and pieced-together knowledge that a novice might have.Benner, P.

It received its world premiere on July 25, 2013 at the Fantasia International Film Festival and stars Dawn Olivieri as a beautiful single mother caught up in one man's obsession with her. Plot summary Katherine (Dawn Olivieri) is a mother trying to raise her son Kesley (Connor Christie) the best she can, despite being recently separated from her husband Ian (Kip Pardue). When Mormon missionary Elder Kevin Brock (Mitch Ryan) offers to help her son practice football, both he and Katherine are drawn to one another.

Part of the film's criticism stemmed from the movie's familiarity to other films in the stalker/slasher genre, but Fearnet noted that \\"You know most of what Missionary has in store before you hit play, but the final product is still a well-crafted and efficient little thriller.\\" Several reviewers brought up concerns about whether or not the film would be considered offensive to people and Empire Online commented that DiBlasi and crew were \\"careful not to demonise the entire religion, and [took] time to make its elders likeably normal\\".

Barclay (born 22 January 1960), professionally known as Rocky Shades, is an English singer. Early life Robert K. Barclay was born on 22 January 1960 in Aldershot, England. He created his stage name in 1976, when he began to sing informally. His career started very early: at the age of 5 he was already singing at the Greenland Social Club Birmingham, where his mother used to work, also as a singer. Music career Before Wrathchild, Shades fronted many minor bands, including Sweet Acid (in 1976) and Hoi Polloi (from 1977 to 1980, later changed the name to Titan). With this one, he also recorded a single called East wind west wind/Losing the fight. In 1980 he auditioned for Wrathchild, with whom he worked until 1991. Between 1980 and 1982, the band recorded two demos: Classical Mayhem (1981) and Mascara Massacre (1982). In the same year they released the single Do You Want My Love?. For the first official release, we'll have to wait until 1983, when they recorded the EP Stuckheel Struck. Breakthrough (1984) The band gained significant popularity in 1984, when they recorded their first studio album, called Stakk Attakk. From the album were taken two singles: Alrite With The Boyz (cover of the Gary Glitter classic Doing Alright With The Boys) and Trash Queen. In the same year a live show was recorded, at the Camden Palace Theatre in London. The concert featured some songs from Stakk Attakk, Cock, Rock, Shock (later in the album Trash Queens, which was released the next year) and two other songs: Blood On The Blade and Give It All You Got. Contractual and legal problems (1984-1991) Unfortunately, just when Shades and the band started getting successful, they had problems first with their label, and then with an American band that was using the same name. The contractual problem with their label, Heavy Metal Records, didn't want to let them sign with a major label, RCA Records, because they thought RCA didn't offer enough money to rescind their contract. The second lawsuit, another band, called Wrathchild, claimed they were using the name \\"Wrathchild\\" before the British band. Shades and the band won the first lawsuit, however it lasted six years. Enough time for RCA Records to change their mind on the band. Wrathchild also won the second lawsuit as well. Both battles heavy influenced the course of the band, with onerous lawyer bills leaving them without money, unable to even give a new thrust at their career. Later, due to tension with the other members, Shades was forced to leave the band. During this period Wrathchild continued recording. In 1984, at the beginning of the contractual problems, a video compilation called War Machine was released, and the next year they recorded the album Trash Queens. In 1988 Wrathchild also recorded an album called The Biz Suxx, a title that clearly reflects their attitude at the time. As if it wasn't already enough, the battles prevented the band from recording right after the Live in London '84 explain the gap of years between ‚Äò‚ÄòTrash Queens and The Biz Suxx. The next year they released their fourth studio album, Delirium. Shades also joined the punk band Discharge between 1986 and 1987, to write songs with them while their vocalist was taking a sabbatical. Shades also recorded a demo with Discharge. After Wrathchild After he was forced to leave Wrathchild, Rocky Shades worked with several bands between 1991 and 2005. From 1991 to 1993 Shades joins ‚ÄúOne track & Dirty‚Äù and forms a band called \\"Sin\\" (not to be confused with the American band of the same name with Rik Fox) with ex Starfighters axeman Pat Hambly, with whom he records a few demos. From 1993 to 1997 he formed a blues rock band Stealing Time (name later changed to Groovebreaker featuring Ex GBH Bassist Sean McCarthy ). From 1997 to 2000 Shades works with and records a few demos with Riff Raff and Prime Time. From 2000 to 2005 Shades forms the Birmingham Blues Brothers Tribute act, tours Europe and Asia (including locations like Bahrain and Malaysia). In 2008 Shades joins the biker metal band \\"The Handsome Beasts\\". Shades perform a few shows with The Handsome Beasts writes and co- composes material for an album that never saw the light of day. In the same year Shades forms the Van Halen tribute band David Lee Wrath (name later changed to Yankee Rose). With this band he performs many memorable shows, like the \\"music live\\" at the N.E.C. Bham Rocky Shades Wrathchild Between 2005 and 2006 Shades founded Rocky Shades Wrathchild, so that he could sing again the hits of the '80. The band recorded a demo Dead Good, but was disbanded without even perform once. A few years later in 2009, another version of the band was formed. Immediately encountered problems due to the name \\"Wrathchild\\", when Phil \\"Wrathchild\\" Vokins, Marc Angel, Eddie Star, and Gaz \\"Psychowrath\\" Harris (at the time under the name of Psychowrath) dragged the band in court. After two years it was decided to disband again the band, and to give Psychowrath the rights for the name \\"Wrathchild\\" and \\"Wrathchild UK\\". Wildside Riot In 2010 a new band was formed, after a year of waiting, due to the fact that three of the members couldn't agree on a name for the band. This first version didn't last long, because of the obvious logistic problem. 2011 a new version of the band ‚ÄúWildside Riot‚Äù saw the light. Unfortunately it didn't last much more than the first one (only two live shows performed), since a member quit for personal reasons. The band as we know it today was formed in the same year, with vocalist Rocky Shades, drummer Gaz Wilde, guitarists Joss Riot and Jimmy Gunn and bass player James Croft. Wildside Riot recorded a few demos, filmed a video, and wrote an album, No Second Take, released on February 2013 which received mainly good reviews by the critics. Rocky Shades, about the new band, is quoted as saying; With the departure of James Croft a new bass player was found: Marty Maelstrom, who has brought a new dimension to the sound with his backing vocals and song writing skills. Wildside Riot, with a second album in the making, is currently touring.

The site lists real estate dealers, developers, agencies, and properties for sale and rent. The company is headquartered in Lahore, Pakistan and has offices in 13 cities across Pakistan, including Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Peshawar and Multan, and operates all over Pakistan. History Zameen.com was founded in 2006 by two Pakistani entrepreneur brothers, Zeeshan and Imran Ali Khan. In 2012, Gilles Blanchard, co-founder SeLoger.com (a French property portal), took up the role of chairman at Zameen.com.  Business model  Initially, Zameen.com allowed free property listings on its website, but shifted to the paid advertisements model in 2010. In 2014, the company also launched its monthly real estate print publication. Today, in addition to providing advertising space on its online platform, Zameen.com also offers exclusive sales and marketing services to real estate developers to generate revenue. Mobile website In March 2013, Zameen.com launched a mobile version of its website. This was a move to make the portal accessible to a wider audience and make it convenient for users. As of March 2018, the website was reported to have attracted more than 5 million monthly visitors, with 32.9 million page views across all devices. Meanwhile, the property listings on the website have crossed the 11 million mark, and the website has 14,500 registered agents. The company also has more than 1,000 developers on its panel, and it has attracted over a million subscribers. Urdu website In February 2013, the site rolled out its Urdu version.  Tools = Pakistan Real Estate Price Index  In February 2016, Zameen.com launched the Pakistan Real Estate Price Index. The tool was created with the help of Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) professors.  Plot Finder  In November 2019, Zameen.com launched a new tool called Plot Finder. This product allows users to access detailed, geo-coded maps of 2,500 housing projects across 38 cities in Pakistan. It roughly corresponds to 1.2 million plot and homes and accurately depicts the properties segmented and finalized by society developers and approved by the authorities.  Property Bank  Zameen.com is also slated to launch a new tool titled ‚ÄòProperty Bank‚Äô. The feature, according to the company‚Äôs Country Head Ahmad Bhatti, will ‚Äúcater to tens of thousands of seller leads that go to waste due to market inefficiencies.‚Äù Additionally, it will catalogue more than 25,000 properties presently listed on the company website that remain without any agency representation.  Search Trends  The ‚ÄòSearch Trends‚Äô tool allows users to explore real estate trends prevalent in the Pakistani marketplace based on the searches launched for different projects as divided into cities, localities and sub-localities. This information is updated each month; rendered in a graphical format. Further, the product allows users to obtain a holistic picture of the areas that were the most popular with buyers and renters at any given point over the last 12-month period.  Brand = Logo  Zameen.com launched in 2006, bearing the ‚ÄúPakistan Property Portal‚Äù tagline as a part of its official logo. This logo inscription underwent a change to the more elaborate ‚ÄúPakistan‚Äôs No 1 Property Website\\" in 2011. More recently, in 2018, it was further modified to read the Urdu transliteration of the brand's popular TVC slogan: ‚ÄúHar Pata, Humain Pata Hai‚Äù (Lit: We Know Every Address).  TV Campaigns  By September 2018, Zameen.com had successfully launched four different large- scale TV campaigns promoting its website and brand operations. The first of these initiatives saw the company adopt the ‚ÄúHar Pata, Humain Pata Hai‚Äù slogan, which has since become part of its logo as well. In 2017, actor Fawad Khan starred in a TV campaign titled ‚ÄúHumain Pata Hai Aap Ke Dil Ki Baat‚Äù, coming on board as the company's official brand ambassador. The ad received approximately 20 million internet views ‚Äì reportedly the highest online viewership count for any Pakistani brand at the time. The company's 2018 campaign, popularized with its ‚ÄúWe can help you find a house, but only you can make it a home‚Äù TVC tagline, again featured Fawad Khan, and proved to be the brand's most successful online production till date ‚Äì receiving more than 4 million views in a few hours, and a total of 22 million views across digital landscape over the next two months. Sheherzad Kaleem, a documentary filmmaker, commenting on the company's campaign for Aurora (a magazine publication owned by the Dawn Group of Newspapers), observed in an August 2018 magazine insert that ‚ÄúZameen.com has created an image for itself that forms an attachment with the viewer. It is the softer, more nuanced persona of the brand, and now when I think Zameen.com, I think family, values, achievement and aspiration.‚Äù  Investment  In 2012, Zameen.com received an angel investment from Gilles Blanchard, the founder of Seloger.com, a French property website. In May 2014, the company struck an investment deal with Frontier Digital Ventures and Catcha Group, after which Shaun Di Gregorio and Patrick Grove, the CEOs of these two enterprises joined Zameen.com's Board of Directors. In September 2015, Zameen.com raised $9 million from three renowned international funds in its Series B investment round. Shortly afterwards, in January 2016, the portal's parent company, the Emerging Markets Property Group (EMPG), announced that it had raised another $20 million in the Series C venture round. In addition to Zameen.com, EMPG also owns and operates Bayut in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Jordan; Bproperty.com in Bangladesh; Mubawab in Morocco and Tunisia; and Kaidee in Thailand. In February 2019, EMPG announced that it had successfully closed its Series D investment round, raising an additional $100 million, the largest round of fundings in the company's history. With this round, the total investment raised by EMPG went up to $160 million, making the group the highest-funded real estate tech company in the region. In April 2020, EMPG and OLX Group announced the merger of their operations in Pakistan, Egypt, Lebanon, and the UAE. The agreement included a $150 million investment round led by OLX Group with $75 million, and the rest invested by existing EMPG shareholders. EMPG‚Äôs valuation reached $1 billion after the conclusion of the deal, making it a unicorn company. Through the transaction, OLX Group has now become EMPG‚Äôs largest single shareholder with a 39% stake; while EMPG will take over OLX platform operations in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and Oman, as well as the dubizzle platform in the UAE.

As of March 2019, over a million people, and more than 1,200 exhibitors have attended the expos over the years. Zameen.com also made inroads in the international markets with its Pakistan Property Show Dubai, held at Dubai World Trade Center in October 2017. This was the first time Pakistani property was exclusively featured at Dubai World Trade Center. The event attracted a record 14,000 visitors‚Äîreportedly the highest for any exclusive event on Pakistani property. The second edition of Pakistan Property Show Dubai was held on the 14th and 15 September 2018; again at the Dubai World Trade Center.

S. Van Dyke and starring Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Taylor. Written by Leon Gordon and John Meehan, based on a story by George Auerbach, the film is about a scientist preparing to leave for the jungles of South America to work on a cure for spotted fever. Wanting to have some fun before his trip, he goes to a gambling club where he meets and falls in love with a beautiful model while falling deep into debt. When he turns to his brother for help, his brother agrees to cover the debt, but only if he leaves without her. While the scientist is away, his brother and the model get married. His Brother's Wife was produced by Lawrence Weingarten for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and was released on August 7, 1936 in the United States. Upon its theatrical release, the film received mixed reviews that praised its expert direction and glossy production, but criticized its \\"outrageous implausibility\\". His Brother's Wife was the first of three films starring Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Taylor; the couple married in 1939. Plot At the Rothmore Institute in New York City, Professor Fahrenheim prepares to travel to the jungles of South America on a two-year project to find a cure for spotted fever, which has been ravaging the Rothmore Mines. Fahrenheim's research assistant, Chris Claybourne, agrees to accompany him, but insists on taking a few weeks off before the trip in order to have some fun. Chris ends up at a gambling club run by a crooked mobster name \\"Fish-Eye\\" and soon loses five thousand dollars on credit. That night, Chris meets beautiful model Rita Wilson, who tags along on his gambling spree. In the coming days, the two fall in love, and when she learns that he will soon be leaving for the jungle, she persuades him to stay. When Fish-Eye demands immediate payment of his gambling debt, Chris turns to his brother Tom for financial assistance. Suspicious of Rita, Tom offers to pay Chris' debt, but only if he leaves for the jungles as planned‚Äîand without Rita. Chris agrees to the proposal and postpone his marriage to Rita until after he returns in two years. Angered by his decision, Rita breaks off the relationship and returns on her own to the gambling club, where she accepts Fish-Eye's offer to work for him as an escort to lure wealthy gamblers to his club in exchange for paying off Chris' debt. Soon after, Tom visits the gambling club and sees Rita, who confesses that it was she who paid Chris' debt with money she inherited from her grandmother. Later that year, on Christmas Eve, Chris returns to New York City and learns that Tom and his fianc√©e have broken up, and that his brother resigned from his position at the hospital. When pressed for an explanation, Tom tells Chris that he fell in love with Rita and that they were secretly married, but later she ridiculed him and refused to stay with him. Believing the worst about Rita, Chris goes to the gambling club looking for her. Filled with remorse over her actions, she confesses her mistakes and admits that she still loves him, not his brother. Chris proposes that she accompany him to the jungle as a friend and wait for Tom to agree to a divorce before renewing their relationship. A few months later, when word arrives that Tom obtained the divorce, Chris tells Rita that he planned all this in order to get back at her for her actions. When she offers to let him use her to test their new serum, Chris refuses and bitterly sends her away. Initially, Professor Fahrenheim planned to test the serum on Chris, but now he has second thoughts about the potential danger to his assistant. When Rita learns that Chris will be used for the testing, she secretly injects herself with the disease in order to save Chris. Moved by her actions and realizing that he still loves her, Chris produces more serum and saves Rita's life. Soon after, Chris and Rita get married and sail back to New York City.

A. Dupont with the working title My Brother's Wife. Gable was later replaced by Franchot Tone, with Richard Boleslawski taking over as director. Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Taylor were finally selected as the leads for His Brother's Wife, the first of their three films together. Stanwyck and Taylor were married in 1939; they were divorced in 1952. Filming After W. S. Van Dyke was brought in to direct, filming from the 137-page script was completed in only thirteen and a half days. Release Produced by Lawrence Weingarten for Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer, His Brother's Wife was released on August 7, 1936 in the United States. Critical response In his review for the New York Times, Frank S. Nugent described the film as \\"incredibly romantic, glossily produced, expertly directed and peopled by the sort of players most often encountered on the covers of the fan magazines\\". But despite this \\"triumph of machine-made art\\", Nugent criticized the story for its \\"romantic absurdity\\" and \\"outrageous implausibility\\". Box office According to MGM records the film earned $1,196,000 in the US and Canada and $466,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $755,000.

Depending on context, the lataif are also understood to be the corresponding qualities of that perception, experience, or action. The underlying Arabic word latifa (singular) means \\"subtlety\\" and all lataif (plural) together are understood to make up the human \\"subtle body\\" (Jism Latif)Almaas, A. H. \\"Essence\\". York Beach, Maine: Samuel Weiser, 1986, p. 143. Realizing (or activating or awakening or \\"illuminating\\") the experience of the individual lataif (and thereby the Jism Latif as a whole) is considered to be a central part of the comprehensive spiritual development that produces the Sufi ideal of a Complete Man (Al-InsƒÅn al-KƒÅmil). Different interpretations Descriptions and interpretations of the lataif differ depending on the specific Sufi tradition and exponent representing it. In addition, individual Sufi teachers (see Sheikh (Sufism)) sometimes interpret aspects of lataif theory and practice according to how the lataif have been uniquely revealed to them.Buehler, Arthur F. \\"Sufi Heirs of the Prophet: Indian Naqshbandiyya and the Rise of the Mediating Sufi Shaykh\\" University of South Carolina Press, 1998, p. 110. In general, there are at least three historical interpretations of the lataif: # that derived from the KubrƒÅwƒ´ order, described in the writings of Najm al-Din Razi (1177-1256) and Ala ud-Daula Simnani (Semnani) (1261-1336), which views the Lataif as potential psychospiritual organs/capacities that can be realized as progressive stages in those undergoing spiritual development; # that derived from the Mujaddidiyya branch of the Naqshbandi order, described in the writings of Ahmad Sirhindi (1564-1624), which views the Lataif as psychospiritual organs/capacities that are potential receptors of Divine energyBuehler, Arthur F. \\"Sufi Heirs of the Prophet: Indian Naqshbandiyya and the Rise of the Mediating Sufi Shaykh\\" University of South Carolina Press, 1998, p. 110. when activated in those undergoing spiritual development; # that derived from the \\"Afghan Tradition\\" See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikbal_Ali_Shah#Sufism for Naqshbandi \\"Afghan Tradition\\". within the Naqshbandi order, described in the writings of Ikbal Ali Shah (1894-1969) and Idries Shah (1924-1996), which views the Lataif as actual human psychospiritual organs/capacities that are implicit in everyday life and made explicit in those undergoing spiritual development. KubrƒÅwƒ´ lataif According to the view of the Kubrawi order there are seven lataif. They are understood cosmologically as \\"descending\\" levels through which reality is created and structured.Bakhtiar, Laleh \\"Sufi Expressions of the Mystical Quest\\" New York, New York: Thames and Hudson, 1976, p. 97. In the process of spiritual development, the individual Sufi is understood to \\"ascend\\" to and through these levels progressively (see ontological Arcs of Descent and Ascent in Sufism). The attainment of each level is a stage associated with the activation/realization of a corresponding spiritual organ/capacity, interpreted symbolically through Islamic cosmology and the prophets and messengers in Islam.Corbin, Henry \\"The Man of Light in Iranian Sufism\\" New Lebanon, New York: Omega Publications, 1978, p. 124-125. In ascending order they are: * Latifa Qalabiya (\\"Mold\\"), associated with an experience of the color black, represents the acquisition of a new organ, an embryonic subtle body. It is interpreted symbolically as \\"the Adam of one's being\\", since Adam was the first human being. * Latifa Nafsiya (\\"Soul\\"), color blue, is an organ that corresponds to the animal soul and is a testing ground for struggle with desires and passions. It is interpreted symbolically as \\"the Noah of one's being\\", since Noah faced the same situation in dealing with the hostility of his people. * Latifa Qalbiya (\\"Heart\\"), color red, is the organ that will develop to become the True Ego, the real personal individuality. It is interpreted symbolically as \\"the Abraham of one's being\\", since the prophet Abraham historically represents the establishment of real religion. * Latifa Sirriya (\\"Secret\\"), color white, is an organ of superconsciousness. It is interpreted symbolically as \\"the Moses of one's being\\", since the prophet Moses participated in spiritual communication with God through this consciousness. * Latifa Ruhiya (\\"Spirit\\"), color yellow, is an organ through which an individual becomes capable of acting as vice-regent of God. It is interpreted symbolically as \\"the David of one's being\\", since the prophet David fulfilled that role. * Latifa Khafiya (\\"Inspiration\\"), color black, is the subtle organ that receives spiritual inspiration. It is interpreted symbolically as \\"the Jesus of one's being\\", since the prophet Jesus was characteristic of such inspiration. * Latifa Haqqiya (\\"Seal\\"), color green, is the subtle organ that is the final achievement of spiritual development: the True Ego. It is interpreted symbolically as \\"the Mohammed of one's being\\", since Mohammed was the final prophet. The historical method of spiritual practice in this interpretation of the Lataif is unknown.(unknown to the compiler of this Wikipedia page) Naqshbandi lataif (Mujaddidiyya) According to the view of the Mujaddidiyya branch of the Naqshbandi order there are five lataif.Buehler, Arthur F. \\"Sufi Heirs of the Prophet: Indian Naqshbandiyya and the Rise of the Mediating Sufi Shaykh\\" University of South Carolina Press, 1998, p. 111. The reception of each latifa's spiritual energy from its corresponding cosmic realm is interpreted symbolically through the prophets and messengers in Islam, similar to the interpretation of the Kubrawi order: * Qalb (color yellow; located below left breast) (Adam) * Ruh (color red; located below right breast) (Abraham/Noah) * Sirr (color white; located above left breast) (Moses) * Khafi (color black; located above right breast) (Jesus) * Ikhfa (color green; located at sternum) (Mohammed) Since, in this interpretation, the lataif all have their physical location in the chest, they are said to be \\"of the Heart\\" (Qalb, used in a different sense than the latifa named Qalb). The lataif are opened through spiritual practice one-by-one in the foregoing order. Viewed as a progressive activation, each latifa (or progressive combination of Lataif) is considered to be a level of spiritual realization. The method of opening each latifa typically begins with a direct transmission by Sufi teacher to student, which can include physical touch (except for women) and the disclosure of the specific one of the Names of God in Islam that is associated with the latifa. The student then continues the practice by silent Dhikr of the Divine Name, focusing attention on the latifa's location; sometimes a visualization of the Name, the corresponding prophet, or the teacher is also added. Naqshbandi lataif (Afghan tradition) According to the Afghan tradition within the Naqshbandi order there are five Lataif:Shah, Idries \\"The Sufis\\". Garden City, New York: Anchor Books, 1971, p. 145, 334, 340. * Qalb (color yellow; experienced in left side of the body) * Ruh (color red; experienced in right side of the body) * Sirr (color white; experienced below the navel) * Khafi (color black; experienced in forehead) * Ikhfa (color green; experienced in center of chest) In the view of Naqshbandi author Idries ShahShah, Idries, \\"Idries Shah - the Latifas\\" audio recording on YouTube which Wikipedia will not allow to link to here. they are understood to be spiritual organs/capacities that also underlie ordinary forms of human consciousness. As such, they are ordinarily only known indirectly through the equivalents (or their distortions) that they pattern on the conventional psychological/emotional/somatic level of human experience. Sufi inspired spiritual teacher Hameed Ali (A. H. Almaas) (1944-) interprets some of these equivalents (and conditioned distortions) as follows:Almaas, A. H. \\"Essence\\". York Beach, Maine: Samuel Weiser, 1986, p. 142. * Qalb (Joy/Wanting) * Ruh (Strength/Anger) * Sirr (Will/Anxiety) * Khafi (Peace/Agitation) * Ikhfa (Compassion/Hurt) With rare exceptions, lataif are only experienced directly (and unconditionedly) in human beings who have undergone a spiritual evolution. The spiritual process of their activation/awakening/illumination consists of various methods, singly or in combination. One such method, a special form of tajalli (\\"disclosure\\" or \\"illumination\\"), involves joint receptivity of a latifa by Sufi teacher and student together.Shah, Idries The Sufis. Garden City, New York: Anchor Books, 1971, p. 145, 334, 340. Another method is the direct activation, called tawajjuh (\\"transmission\\"), of the latifa by an intentional interaction between teacher and student. Yet another method, a special kind of muraqabah (meditation), includes having the student concentrate awareness on the part of the body that is related to a latifa.Shah, Idries \\"The Sufis\\". Garden City, New York: Anchor Books, 1971, p. 332. History of interpretations The general concept of spiritual \\"subtle centers\\" (usually three) apparently originated within Persian Sufism: Junayd of Baghdad (835-910), Al-Ghazali (1058-1111), and Shahab al-Din Abu Hafs Umar Suhrawardi (1145-1234).Buehler, Arthur F. \\"Sufi Heirs of the Prophet: Indian Naqshbandiyya and the Rise of the Mediating Sufi Shaykh\\" University of South Carolina Press, 1998, p. 106. Among the earliest systematic formulations of the lataif specifically is thought to be that of Persian and Kubrawi Sufi Najm al-Din Razi (1177-1256). He proposed five lataif (at least Qalb, Ruh, Sirr, and Khafi), possibly to parallel the five inner and outer senses of the Islamic version of ancient Greek medical theory,Hermansen, Marcia K., \\"ShƒÅh Walƒ´ AllƒÅh's Theory of the Subtle Spiritual Centers (La·π≠ƒÅ æif): A Sufi Model of Personhood and Self-Transformation\\" Chicago, Illinois: Loyola University Chicago, 1988, p. 7. and sought to establish a basis for them in the Quran. The seven lataif model then followed with Persian and Kubrawi Sufi Ala ud-Daula Simnani (1261-1336),Corbin, Henry \\"The Man of Light in Iranian Sufism\\" New Lebanon, New York: Omega Publications, 1978, p. 124-125. who added two lataif to the five of Razi ‚Äì one above (Qalabiya) and one below (Haqqiya),Hermansen, Marcia K., \\"ShƒÅh Walƒ´ AllƒÅh's Theory of the Subtle Spiritual Centers (La·π≠ƒÅ æif): A Sufi Model of Personhood and Self-Transformation\\" Chicago, Illinois: Loyola University Chicago, 1988, p. 7. possibly to parallel the seven ontological levels of Sufi cosmology. From the 17th to 19th centuries, the Indian Mujaddidis, beginning with Ahmad Sirhindi (1564-1624), returned to a standardized interpretation of five experiential lataif and associated their locations with parts of the physical body.Buehler, Arthur F. \\"Sufi Heirs of the Prophet: Indian Naqshbandiyya and the Rise of the Mediating Sufi Shaykh\\" University of South Carolina Press, 1998, p. 109. The Afghan tradition within the Naqshbandi in the late 19th and 20th centuries continued with five lataif but identified the experience of their physical locations differently and viewed them not just as higher centers of consciousness but also as centers of ordinary consciousness not properly awakened.Shah, Idries, \\"Idries Shah - the Latifas\\" audio recording on YouTube which Wikipedia will not allow to link to here. Since the Divine Attributes that underlie the lataif are in principle unlimited (just as with the nominal 99 names of God in Islam), it is thought by someAlmaas, A. H., \\"The Inner Journey Home\\". Boston, Massachusetts: Shambhala Publications, 2004, p. 579. that the actual number of lataif and their potential realization by humanity might likewise be unlimited.

It is also spelled Lo according to the Cantonese pronunciation. Lu Âç¢ is the 52nd most common surname in China, shared by 5.6 million people, or 0.475% of the Chinese population as of 2002. It is especially common in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, and Hebei provinces. Lu Âç¢ is listed 167th in the Song Dynasty classic text Hundred Family Surnames. In 2019 it was the 50th most common surname in Mainland China.http://www.bjnews.com.cn/news/2020/01/20/676822.html Origins According to the Tang Dynasty genealogy text Yuanhe Xing Zuan, the surname Lu Âç¢ originated in the State of Qi during the Spring and Autumn period, and descended from Gao Xi (È´òÂÇí). Gao Xi was the grandson of Prince Gao, who was a son of Duke Wen of Qi (reigned 815‚Äì804 BC) and a descendant of L√º Shang, the founder of Qi. When the Qi ruler Wuzhi was murdered in 685 BC, Gao Xi, then prime minister of Qi, helped to install Prince Xiaobai on the throne, to be known as Duke Huan of Qi, one of the Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn period. In gratitude, Duke Huan enfeoffed Gao Xi at the city of Lu Âç¢ (in modern Changqing District, Shandong province), and many of Gao's descendants adopted Lu Âç¢ as their surname. This is the main origin of the surname, and Gao Xi is regarded as the founding ancestor of the Lu Âç¢ surname. According to the Song Dynasty encyclopedia Tongzhi, there was a second source of the Lu Âç¢ surname from the State of Qi. A branch of Duke Huan of Qi's descendants had the surname Lupu (Âç¢Ëí≤), which was later shortened to Lu. A separate source of Lu was the minor state of Luzi Â∫êÂ≠ê or Lu Â∫ê (in modern Anhui province) during the Spring and Autumn period. The descendants of Jili (Êà¢Èªé), a nobleman of Lu, adopted the name of their state as their surname. Lu Â∫ê was later simplified to Lu Âç¢. Distribution Of the top 30 cities in China, Âç¢ ranked 9th most common in the city of Nanning.\\"https://www.douban.com/group/topic/23803598/\\"(Chinese) Later adoption During the Xianbei Northern Wei dynasty, Emperor Xiaowen (reigned 467‚Äì499 AD) implemented a drastic policy of sinicization, ordering his own people to adopt Chinese surnames. The Tufulu (Âêê‰ºèÂç¢) and Molu (Ëé´Âç¢) clans of Xianbei adopted Lu as their surname. The Xianbei people have since completely assimilated into the Han Chinese. According to the Book of Sui, Zhangchou Taiyi (Á´†‰ªáÂ§™Áøº), a native of Hejian Commandery (in modern Cangzhou, Hebei) was a famous scholar of the time. Emperor Yang of Sui granted him the surname Lu Âç¢. Zhangchou subsequently became known as Lu Taiyi, and was the ancestor of the prosperous Hejian Lu clan. Lu clan of Fanyang In the fourth century BC, the throne of the Qi state was usurped by the Tian clan. Many aristocratic clans that descended from the old ruling house of Jiang (Âßú), including Lu, fled the state and dispersed all over China. During the Qin dynasty, the erudite Lu Ao (ÁõßÊïñ) settled in Fanyang Commandery (modern Beijing). The Fanyang Lu clan later became exceedingly prosperous. During the Jin Dynasty (265‚Äì420), the Fanyang Lu, together with the Cui clan of Boling, the Wang clan of Taiyuan, the Zheng clan of Xingyang, and the Li clan of Zhao, were considered the five most prominent clans in China (Êµ∑ÂÜÖ‰∫îÂ§ßÊúõÊóè). During the Tang dynasty, eight chancellors were surnamed Lu Áõß, including several from Fanyang. During the Tang dynasty the Li clan of Zhao ËµµÈÉ°ÊùéÊ∞è, the Cui clan of Boling, the Cui clan of Qinghe, the Lu clan of Fanyang, the Zheng clan of Xingyang Ëç•Èò≥ÈÉëÊ∞è, the Wang clan of Taiyuan Â§™ÂéüÁéãÊ∞è, and the Li clan of Longxi Èö¥Ë•øÊùéÊ∞è were the seven noble clans between whom marriage was banned by law.http://history.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/slides/Dissertation.pdf p. 67.

With extensive academic and fieldwork experience, he has published findings about sites in Afghanistan, Nepal, India, and China in particular. Verardi has joined or directed several long archaeological missions to central Asia, and held positions on numerous Italian scientific boards. He has a particular interest in Indian iconography and history. Brief biography Giovanni Verardi (born 1947) was a professor at the University of Naples of Oriental Studies (\\"L'Orientale\\"), Italy, where he taught Art and Archaeology of Central Asia and Art and Archaeology of India. He spent time in a number of universities outside Italy, including as a ma√Ætre de conf√©rences at the Coll√®ge de France in Paris, guest professor at the University of Kyoto, and visiting professor in Japan (Kyoto University, Seij≈ç University, and International College for Advanced Buddhist Studies in Tokyo). As early as 1970 he joined the Italian Archaeological Mission to Afghanistan, where he started his work as field archaeologist at the Buddhist site of Tapa Sardar near Ghazni, in whose territory he carried out extensive surveys that led to the discovery of several groups of Buddhist rock-cut monasteries. In 1981 he joined the Italian Archaeological Mission to Nepal, of which he became director in 1988. Research work was first carried out at the site of Harigaon in Kathmandu and after at the A≈õokan site of Gotihawa in the Tarai, c. 25 km west of Lumbini. In the 1980s Verardi participated in the activities of the German-Italian Mission to Mohenjo-daro in Pakistan, where he could ascertain that the so-called st≈´pa-cum monastery rising upon the ruins of the Indus town is nothing but the articulated late phase of the Indus religious/ritual building, erroneously interpreted as a Buddhist structure by John Marshall. Between 1998 and 2003, Verardi was co-director of the Italian- Chinese team engaged in the excavation of the Fengxiansi monastery at Longmen near Luoyang, connected with the Empress Wu Zetian (AD 690‚Äí705) and rebuilt during the Song dynasty. Besides his activity as a field archaeologist, Verardi has devoted himself to the study of Indian iconography and Indian history. He retired in November 2007.

It makes the popular Cola Couronne Fruit Champagne and recently added Di√®te Couronne Fruit Champagne, Couronne Limonade, and Di√®te Couronne Limonade. It bottles Coca- Cola, Sprite, Fanta, and Gladiator for the Coca-Cola Company. History Brasserie de la Couronne was founded in 1924 and, three years later, the relationship with Coca-Cola started in 1927. It was acquired by Richard J. Forgham in the early 1950s and in turn sold to brothers Roger and Raymond Jaar in 1983. In 1986, the plant was then moved from its downtown Port-au-Prince location to a 33-acre site. Significant improvements were made to increase the plant¬¥s productivity in 1995 where the technical infrastructure was updated, and the size of the plant was increased. It is one of the longest running companies as well as one of the largest private sector employers in Haiti today. It sponsors many sporting and cultural events in the community in Haiti throughout the year and provides support to local hospitals, associations and schools. Scholarship funds and the purchase of school supplies in Port-au- Prince and in other provinces are raised through their UTC promotions that allow consumers to help fund them. Economic Impact In association with Coca-Cola, nearly $16 million is expected to be invested in 2010, and $30 million over five years which could ultimately create an additional one thousand jobs. This includes improvements in the plant in Port-au-Prince; construction of a waste water treatment facility; procurement of glass, trucks and coolers; the addition of a new PET line and the upgrade of a new line to bottle juice.

Dekkers was born to Hendrik Pieter Dekkers, a school principal, and Anna Elizabeth Berdina Godtschalk. Adrian attended his father's school and also received training as a decorative painter. Between 1954 and 1958 he studied at the Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam where he was mostly engaged in drawing of landscapes and still images. In February 1960 Dekkers entered military service, and in December 1961 married Machelina Hendrika van Bruggen, with whom he had one son. From the early 1960s Dekkers became dissatisfied with painting and focused on reliefs, mostly made of plastic. By 1968 he was recognized as a master in this area and started creating monumental sculptures and reliefs in architectural environment. His works became accepted at major international exhibitions, such as the Biennale de Paris in 1965, S√£o Paulo Art Biennial in 1967 and documenta in Kassel in 1968. He also had a number of solo exhibitions in the Netherlands. After his death in 1974, his works were exhibited in Eindhoven and D√ºsseldorf and placed in museums in the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, England and the United States.

Away from sport, she works for the German Federal Police. Griebel was injured in 2016 and spent 18 months recovering before returning to the World Cup circuit in November 2017, but after poor showings in the season's first two races, she was replaced on the German World Cup squad by Anna Fernst√§dt. Notable results Griebel began international competition in 2008 on the Europe Cup, finishing 10th in her first race, at St. Moritz. At the 2009 Skeleton Junior World Championships she finished just off the podium in 4th place; that same season saw her take three podium finishes on the Europe Cup, including one gold, taking third place on the tour overall. The following season, she continued to race in the Europe Cup, taking five podiums (three wins) but only ninth at the Junior World Championships. Griebel was promoted to the Intercontinental Cup for the 2010‚Äì11 season, earning three gold medals and five silvers on the way to a first-place finish in the ICC season rankings, but only took fifth in the Junior World Championships.

Griebel returned the World Cup in 2014‚Äì15, earning her best finishes to date with fourth-place results at Calgary, Altenberg, and K√∂nigssee, but finished a disappointing 12th at her first senior World Championships. She ended that season ranked sixth in the World Cup rankings, behind two of her German teammates. The following (2015‚Äì16) season, Griebel finished fourth again at Altenberg and improved her World Championships result to fifth, but then was forced to sit out the entire 2016‚Äì17 season due to injury.

Dating from 1912, the Horns Rev, also known as Motorfyrskibet Nr. I, is the world's oldest and best preserved motor lightship. It houses a highly regarded exhibition of life and work on board. History The world's largest and best preserved wooden lightship, Motorfyrskibet Nr. I, was built at the Rasmus M√∏ller shipyard in F√•borg. The contract was signed in June 1912 and the ship was delivered on schedule in August 1914. From the beginning it was intended to serve shipping from the Port of Esbjerg. Apart from short periods when it was stationed elsewhere or undergoing maintenance, it spent most of its working life off Esbjerg, first at Vyl Station or at Horns Rev Station where it last served in 1880. Both these positions lie west of Esbjerg in the North Sea. Its final period of service was off the island of M√∏n (at M√∏n SE Station) from 1981 to 1988. In 1989, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Culture, it was acquired by Fonden til bevarelse af Motorfyrskib Nr.1 (Foundation for the preservation of Motor Light Vessel No. 1). It opened as a museum in July 1990. The positions the lightship served at Horns Rev and Vyl, which indicate one of the most dangerous reefs in Danish waters, have now been replaced by light buoys. Motorfyrskib No. I thumb Built of oak, the ship has a length of , a breadth of and a draught of . Its displacement is 342 tonnes. It originally had a 125-horsepower, two-stroke engine which was later replaced with a three-cylinder, 180-horsepower diesel engine. Initially, the light could be hoisted up and down the mast and could be prepared for use on deck but it was later permanently secured at the top of the mast. It was displayed amidships from a round lantern. The ship's hull is painted with the colours of the Danish flag: red with a white horizontal band and a vertical white stripe. Museum Located at Esbjerg's new area \\"Havne√∏en\\" at the northernmost end of the harbour, the museum ship is open to visitors from May to August, Monday to Friday, 11 am to 4 pm.

It tells the story of a librarian who is first furious at a man who rips out page 198 of books, then becomes intrigued, and finally decides to help him after learning that he's heartbroken after his girlfriend broke up with him then left a note to look up page 198, without mentioning which book. Plot Eun-soo works conscientiously as a librarian in a seaside village. One day, she catches a mysterious man damaging some books at the library; the man, clad in a black suit with a black tie, tears out a single page from every book he comes across. At first, Eun-soo accuses him of book vandalism and reports him to the police, but she soon becomes curious regarding the complex story behind his actions. Joon-oh's girlfriend had suddenly left him with only a mysterious note, \\"Look up page 198.\\" So Joon-oh goes to the library everyday and tears out page 198 from every book, hoping that he will find a message that might lead to his beloved or at least the reason for her disappearance. When Eun-soo checks the library database, she discovers that Joon-oh's girlfriend was a bibliophile, checking out a total of 956 books from the library. Eun-soo initially advises Joon-oh to let his ex-girlfriend go if that's her wish, because keeping trying to trace her is just an empty obsession. But since Joon-oh shows no sign of quitting, and she herself has just broken up with her boyfriend and is feeling her own loss in love, Eun-soo decides to help him decipher the messages on page 198 of all the books.

Life Derlington became a Dominican friar, and it has been inferred that he studied at Paris at the Dominican priory of St Jacques, because his name is mentioned as working on the second edition (Concordanti√¶ Magn√¶, about 1250) of Hugues de St Cher's Latin concordance. In 1256 he was made a member of Henry III's council, and taken into the king's confidence, also at some point becoming Henry's confessor. In 1256 Derlington persuaded the king to release a converted Jew of Lincoln, imprisoned on suspicion of complicity in the murder of a child. In 1258 he helped draw up the Provisions of Oxford, as one of the king's nominees; in 1263 he was present at the drawing up of the instrument by which Henry III agreed to submit the questions arising from the provisions of Oxford to the arbitration of Louis IX. In August 1278 Derlington was part of a mission to Rome from Edward I with William of Louth and Henry of Newark. In negotiations with Pope Nicholas III, he was appointed a collector of papal revenue in England. The collection of the \\"tenth\\" was a long task, but it had hardly begun when Derlington was raised to the see of Dublin, which had been vacant since the death of Fulk Basset in 1271. The appointment was the Pope's personal choice, made to resolve a confused situation involving a bitter struggle between two rival nominees, Fromund Le Brun and William de la Corner. Edward received Derlington's homage and fealty on 27 April 1279, and next day restored him to his temporalities. He was consecrated on 26 August, at Waltham Abbey, by Archbishop John Peckham. The contentious collection of the tenth kept Derlington from his see, and the king allowed him to be represented by attorney in Ireland, and gave him special license to remain in England. Other troubles also detained Derlington, including a clash with Peckham. In 1283 Edward I seized the collected tenth for the crusade, but then was compelled to give it up. With other business over, Derlington set off for Ireland, but had not gone far from London, when he went down with a mortal sickness. He died on 28 March 1284, and was buried in the choir of Blackfriars church in London.

The Penguin Special edition originally cost 6d (six old English pennies) and sold a hundred thousand copies.Susan Briggs, The Home Front: War Years in Britain, 1939-1945, p 38 Harold Nicolson At the time of writing, Nicolson was National Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Leicester West. Nicolson had been among the few MPs to raise questions in the House of Commons about the threat of fascism. Origin of book On 25 September 1939, Allen Lane, the founder of Penguin Books, commissioned Nicolson to write a Penguin Special of 50,000 words to present to the British people the reasons why they were at war with Germany, and why it was so crucial to defeat Nazism. The book quickly became a bestseller and sold 100,000 copies and had three reprints by February 1940. Anthony Eden wrote to Nicolson that he was \\"very much in favour of my Penguin and has bought many copies\\". Using high irony, low sarcasm and the telling phrase Nicolson sought to ensure the public were fully aware of the threat of Nazism during the Phoney War between the fall of Poland in October 1939 and the German invasions of Denmark and Norway in April 1940.Anrew Roberts, Why Britain is at War: A New Introduction\\", p viii Book outline By initially introducing the story of murderer George Joseph Smith, Nicolson quickly compares the methods and strategies adopted by Hitler to force Britain and France to accede to his demands for territory, including the Rhineland, Austria, Czechoslovakia and later Poland. Nicolson provides details on Hitler's early life and also critically reviews Mein Kampf. Separate chapters deal with each of the territorial claims being made by Nazi Germany - starting with the seizure of the Rhineland in March 1936, through the forced Anschluss for Austria in March 1938, the foreign policy issues surrounding the Munich Agreement between March and September 1938, the seizure of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 and then the invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939. The book concludes with a review of the main causes for the outbreak of the war and suggestions as to its aims and purposes.

She is a former Member of the European Parliament (MEP).  Early life and career  Graduated in philosophy and pedagogy, she was a teacher of literary and Latin subjects at high schools as well as a consultant for cultural activities at public and private institutions.  Politics  She entered politics in the 80's, militating in the PCI then PDS, DS and PD. She was regional secretary of Sardinian PD from July to December 2008. She has been assessor and municipal councilor of the municipality of Sorgono, as mayor of the same municipality from 2005 to 2010 (elected with 100% as the only candidate); she also was Regional Councilor of Sardinia from 2004 to 2013. In 2009 he ran for the European Parliament in the ranks of the PD in the Islands constituency and obtained 116,844 preferences, making her the first of the non-elected, and then taking over from Rosario Crocetta on 17 December 2012, after his resignation for the election as President of the Sicilian Region. On 29 September 2013 he won the centre-left primary in the first round ahead of the regional elections in Sardinia in 2014 with 44.3% of the vote and 22,808 preferences. On the following 30 December, however, after some pressure from members of her party, she renounced to participate in the electoral competition, as she was investigated in the investigation into the \\"crazy expenses\\" of funds to regional groups, and was therefore replaced by economist Francesco Pigliaru, later elected President of Sardinia. On 28 February 2014 she was appointed Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism led by Minister Dario Franceschini, in the Renzi Government, resigning as MEP, ratified on 11 March 2014. Her appointment caused serious perplexity as Matteo Renzi himself, at the time new secretary of PD, asked Barracciu to renounce the race as a center-left candidate for the Presidency of Sardinia despite the victory in the primary, two months from the vote, because investigated for the use of regional funds. However Renzi and the Minister of Reforms Maria Elena Boschi defended the appointment of Barracciu, and other undersecretaries under investigation, reiterating that the guarantee notice should not be judged as a definitive sentence. In 2015 she ran for city councilor in her city Sorgono, in support of the mayoral candidate Vincenzo Rodi and his list \\"A future for Sorgono\\". The list, however, suffered a heavy defeat; the left-wing civic candidate, the trade unionist CGIL Giovanni Arru, was elected mayor, whose \\"Unita Mente\\" list obtained 68% (789 votes), surpassing Rodi stopped at 33% with 372 votes; however Barracciu with 88 votes is the most voted on the losing list after the mayoral candidate by entering the city council. In November 2019 she left the PD and joined new Matteo Renzi's political party Italia Viva.Francesca Barracciu: \\"Credo ancora nella politica, ma non nel Pd\\"Sardegna: Italia Viva recluta la Barracciu, condannata a 3 anni  Judicial proceedings  In September 2013 she was entered in the register of suspects together with 33 other exponents: two months later, the then MEP and candidate for governor, was heard by the prosecutor Marco Cocco to answer for the failure to report on expenses made by the regional council group between February 2006 and January 2009, for a total of thirty-three thousand euros in mileage reimbursements for fuel. On 21 October 2015 she was indicted on charges of having used public funds for purposes other than those envisaged, for an amount of approximately 81,000 euros, during her mandate as regional councilor of Sardinia from 2004 to 2013.

There were two variants planned, AirStrato Explorer with a target flight ceiling of 18,000 m and AirStrato Pioneer with a target flight ceiling of 8000 m. It was planned to carry a 45 kg payload consisting of surveillance equipment, scientific instruments or additional battery pods for extended autonomy... The first prototype maiden flight took place on February 28, 2014. It was equipped with a fixed landing gear. Two more prototypes were constructed that lacked a landing gear. Instead ARCA opted for a pneumatic catapult as a launcher and landing skids and a recovery parachute for landing. Both prototypes performed take-off and landing testing and low altitude flights. Development AirStrato prototype 001 before takeoff AirStrato was first presented by ARCA on February 10, 2014 as an alternative to the stratospheric balloons that had been used before in missions involving the Helen and Stabilo programs and the high altitude flights for the ExoMars program. Although capable of carrying less payload than a helium or solar balloon, the aircraft had a much lower cost per mission and could stay in the stratosphere for longer periods of time. Unlike a weather balloon that could not be steered and relied on wind forecasts to predict its trajectory the AirStrato could be remote controlled by a pilot on the ground. At that time ARCA designed the UAV to fulfill its own requirements for high altitude equipment testing and had a commercial version of the aircraft for consideration. The first prototype was equipped with a fixed landing gear and had two electric motors. After a series of runway testing on rough ground, suspensions were added to the landing gear to improve handling and the number of electric motors was increased to four. The first prototype flew on February 28, 2014. ARCA released several images of AirStrato taking off and flying at very low altitude. The press release stated that the right landing gear suspension was damaged on landing.. For nine months ARCA did not make public any news on the progress of the program, until November 10 when it released a short teaser on the aircraft featuring two other models in red and yellow colours performing flights. The two models lacked a landing gear. On its website it presented the aircraft as intended to fill a gap between large military grade UAV and small scale affordable drones for small businesses and individuals. On November 25 it made public the product website alongside a much longer video presenting the aircraft taking off from a pneumatic launcher and performing low altitudes flights. The aircraft were equipped with landing skids and deployable parachutes. Two versions of the aircraft are available, a larger stratospheric flying model with longer endurance, named Explorer and a slightly smaller version indended for lower altitudes and having less endurance, named Pioneer.. In 2015, ARCA received $215,000 of seed funding from Anova Technologies to develop the AirStrato UAV. Additional funding, totaling $750,000, was to be invested if ARCA met certain development milestones, including flight tests and FAA certification. However, after a series of business disputes about additional funding, the AirStrato program was sold to Anova Technologies. Design=Airframe The airframe is constructed entirely from composite materials making possible for radio antennae to be placed inside the fuselage instead of outside such is usual for normal aircraft. At the base of the fuselage, underneath the wings there are two skids used for mounting and sliding across the side rails of the pneumatic catapult. Another small skid is installed underneath the frontal part of the fuselage that attaches to the middle rail of the catapult. Two more large skids are placed at the far edge of the wings. The parachute container is installed in the frontal part of the fuselage. The parachute can be deployed for landing or in case of emergency.. Engines and power Six electric driven propeller engines are installed on the wings that generate a combined thrust of 250 lbf at sea level. Although the power output remains constant as altitude increases the propellers lose their effectiveness but are still able to provide cruising speed of 152 km/h at altitude for the Explorer and 100 km/h for the Pioneer. The electrical motors are powered by internal batteries during night and solar panels during daytime. The solar panels generate 2800W for the Explorer and 1800W for the Pioneer.. Avionics and control The aircraft are equipped with inertial flight stabilization and autopilot. The GPS is linked with the transponder providing both altitude and coordinates, capable of being integrated into the US NextGeneration Air Transportation System. The control is via internet, using GSM networks where available and satellite connection everywhere else. The autopilot prevents the aircraft from entering restricted areas, can automatically takeover flying in case all communication is lost and attempt to contact ARCA technical support in case of emergency. It also is able to fly to a predetermined secure area and automatically deploy the parachute in case connection can no longer be established. The autopilot can also control the on-board camera to target specific locations and film them for a pre-determined period of time. The connection between the aircraft and the ground pilot are encrypted using Transport Layer Security with AES 256 encryption standard.. Pneumatic launcher A compressed air catapult is used as a takeoff method for both models. The internal pneumatic piston has a force of 2,200 lbf, able to propel the aircraft to take-off speed in less than a second. It is also constructed from composite materials and has an internal compressor that requires an external power source (power outlet or generator). It is made of three parts: the upper part that contains the rails, compressor and canister and the leg that is made of the main part and a crosspiece. Variants=Explorer Airstrato prototype 002 on pneumatic launcher It is the most expensive of the two models and with the highest performance. The Explorer was also the only one able to fly into the stratosphere, although no high-altitude flight tests were ever attempted to confirm its performance. It was also to include components such as transponder and satellite internet connection devices that are optional for the Pioneer. It has a larger wingspan, more solar cells and longer endurance. The selling price was advertised as $140,000. Pioneer It has lower overall performance than the Explorer but has greater maneuverability and rate of climb. It uses the same ground station and the same connection protocol as the Explorer. It can be equipped with all the accessories of the Explorer, including transponder, satellite connection, 4K resolution gimbal camera, FLIR camera, deployable containers etc. Specifications=AirStrato Explorer AirStrato prototype 002 in flight AirStrato Pioneer AirStrato prototypes 002 and 003 inside hangar ReferencesExternal links * AirStrato website * ARCA website Category:Solar-powered aircraft Category:Unmanned aerial vehicles of Romania Category:ARCAspace ","title":"AirStrato"},{"id":"41929853","text":"Sunnydale Farm is a historic home and farm complex located near Pound, Wise County, Virginia.

It has cylindrical pseudobulbs, thin, dark green leaves and between five and ten yellowish green flowers that do not open widely. Description Dendrobium macropus is an epiphytic or lithophytic orchid with cylindrical, yellowish green, cane-like pseudobulbs long and wide. There are between three and six narrow lance-shaped leaves on the end of the pseudobulb. The leaves are long and wide. Between five and ten fragrant, creamy yellow flowers long and wide are arranged on a flowering stem long. The sepals are about long and wide, the petals a similar length but narrower. The labellum is similar to the petals in size and shape but curved. Flowering occurs between August and October but the flowers are self-pollinating and do not open widely. Taxonomy and naming The Norfolk island cane orchid was first described in 1833 by Stephan Endlicher who gave it the name Thelychiton macropus and published the description in his book Prodromus Florae Norfolkicae. In 1858 John Lindley changed the name to Dendrobium macropus based on a discovery by Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach. The specific epithet (macropus) is derived from the Ancient Greek words makros meaning \\"long\\" and pous meaning ‚Äúfoot‚Äù, alluding to the relatively long pseudobulb, in contrast to that of Dendrobium brachypus described by Endlicher at the same time. Distribution and habitat Dendrobium macropus occurs on Australia's external territory of Norfolk Island in the Tasman Sea. It grows on trees and rocks in humid forests.

Constable. p78 Alternative names are Beldornie, Beldornay and Beldorny. History The property, one of the earliest Z-plan castles in the North East, has been owned by members of the Ogilvy, Gordon, Lyon, Buchan and Grant families. In 1545 George Gordon purchased the land from the Earl of Huntly, and the castle was built before he died in 1575. Two wings were built to the west in 1679, while the original entrance was replaced. The castle was acquired by Alexander Gordon in 1713 and he remodelled it, including first- floor rooms formed from the hall which have since been removed. An interesting wall painting of a woman playing the lute was among paintings discovered during this restoration. The work included introducing bolection-moulded chimney-pieces and coved ceilings. Thomas Buchan of Auchmacoy bought the Beldorney estate in 1807 from Charles Gordon of Wardhouse, the last of the line of Gordons of Beldorney. Buchan sold the castle and estate to Sir William Grant, Master of the Rolls and MP for Banffshire. On his death it passed to his brother, Major John Grant of Dawlish, Devon. In 1830 a north wing was added. Subsequently there has been restoration work in 1890, remodelling other floors under the supervision of Alexander Marshall Mackenzie, and in the early 1980s. Structure Beldorney Castle The main block of the castle lies north to south. At the north-west angle is a smaller square tower, which contains the main stair, named the Dog Tower, and having a dog finial. At the south- east angle is a large drum tower, which has a rounded gable. The original entry was in the re-entrant angle with the square tower. The basement, which contains a kitchen and two cellars, is vaulted. From one of the cellars ‚Äì the wine-cellar ‚Äì a mural stair led to the Hall. Fragments of the painting of the Hall ceiling survive. It appears that the second floor also had a Hall, and a tower room. There is a mural stair in the turret in the re-entrant angle of the south gable; this gave access to the second floor room and the third-floor watch-room. The two 1679 wings to the west enclose a courtyard, the entrance to which is an arched gateway, marked with the initials of John Gordon and Anne, and the date, on the inner side. It has renaissance detail, a semi- circular tympanum above entablature with ball finials. The south wing is a single storey high. The replacement entrance, decorated with an ogee-headed panel containing a winged angel‚Äôs head, is in the centre of the west face. It is a category A listed building.

The word signifies rough ground, or a small hill. Some men who brought the surname \\"Clapp\\" to America include: Captain Roger Clapp, who came to the New World on the ship Mary and John, which landed at Nantasket (now Hull, Massachusetts), on May 30, 1630. He helped establish the town of Dorchester, Massachusetts, soon afterward. He worked for many years in important positions for the town and in the military organization, including a long period as commandant of Castle Island. Deacon Edward Clapp, an older brother of Roger, arrived in Dorchester, Massachusetts, in 1633. It has mistakenly been reported that he had no children, but his last will and testament prove otherwise. Edward was married to Prudence, and their son Nehemiah married Sarah Leavitt, daughter of John Leavitt, one of the first settlers of Dorchester and later of Hingham, Massachusetts.Will of Deacon John Leavitt, mention of his daughter Sarah ClapList of the First Settlers of the Town, History of the Town of Dorchester, Massachusetts, Dorchester Antiquarian and Historical Society, Ebenezer Clapp Jr., Boston, 1859 Nehemiah Clapp lived in Hingham for a few years, but relocated to Dorchester, where he died at age 38 in 1684.

He later moved to Weymouth, and then to Scituate, Massachusetts, where he was a Deputy of the Court. Deacon Nicholas Clapp, brother of Thomas, arrived in Dorchester, Massachusetts, in 1633. He was an upstanding member of his community, occasionally mediating disputes.

She was a small vessel, of 44 tons (bm) and six 2-pounder guns, and she served from 27 February 1793 to 1 November 1801.Winfield (2008), p.387. Diligent recaptured Myrmidon. Myrmidon had been sailing from Newcastle with a cargo of lumber when a privateer captured her. Diligent sent her into Sheerness, where Myrmidon arrived around 14 July 1797.Lloyd's List, no. 2939, - accessed 12 February 2014. Diligent, under the command of Mr. Matthew Randall, was in the fleet under Admiral Lord Duncan at the Battle of Camperdown on 11 October. Diligents role was to stand off the larboard or lee division and repeat signals.Duncan (1898), p.212. After the battle, as a member of the fleet even though she did not participate in the combat, she was entitled to share in the ¬£120,000 in prize money for the sale of the Dutch ships captured then. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General service Medal with clasp \\"Camperdown\\" to any surviving claimants from the action. Diligents officers and crew qualified. On 24 October 1798 took two Dutch ships, Waakzaamheid and Furie in the Texel. The sloop , Diligent, and several other vessels shared in the proceeds of the capture. At some point, Diligent, still under Randall's command, recaptured William and Freedom. In 1799 Diligent, under the command of Thomas Dawson, was on the Downs and North Sea station.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 1, p.264. Diligente was among the vessels that shared in the proceeds of the capture of the galiot Neptunus on 29 March 1799. Diligent participated in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in the naval part of the expedition under the command of Vice- admiral Admiral Archibal Dickson Andrew Mitchell. On 27 August, Diligent participated in the capture of three Dutch vessels. Three days later, Diligent was among the British vessels at the Vlieter Incident, and therefore shared in the prize money for it too. The sloop and Diligent detained , and some neutral vessels, on 30 August 1800. On 15 December 1800, Admiral Archibald Dickson at Yarmouth Roads, sent , , the hired armed lugger Phoenix, and hired armed cutter Drake on a cruise to protect the homeward-bound Baltic fleet from French privateers, one having been reported off Scarborough. He stated in a letter that he intended to augment the patrol with Inspector and the cutters Hazard and Diligent when they arrived.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p. 513.Dickson's letter refers to Diligence, but there is no record of a hired cutter Diligence.

Biography  Pe≈°ta was born into the family of architect Anton√≠n Pe≈°ta and psychologist Helena Montanelli-Pe≈°tov√°. After completing secondary school of civil engineering, he studied at the V√°clav Hollar College of Art in Prague. During the communist era, Pe≈°ta became a part of the country's alternative culture scene and later earned a living as a graphic designer of posters and LP covers. After 2000, he finally left behind book illustrations and applied art and devoted himself exclusively to freelance art. He made study trips to New York in 1998 and in 2000. Pe≈°ta has exhibited independently since 1992, and has participated in prestigious group exhibitions and biennals. Some of his most important projects include I was born in your bed, held at the 55th Venice Biennale in 2013. His subsequent work shown at the Venice Biennale was within the collateral projects titled Personal Structures, exhibited at the Palazzo Bembo (Nocturnal Head Records, 2015) and in Palazzo Mora (Screams, cycle of paintings, 2017). He was awarded the 2nd prize in painting at London Art Biennale in 2017London Art Biennale, Winners 2017 and also 2nd prize for expressionist art in 2019.London Art Biennale, Winners 2019 His most important achievement so far was the extensive solo exhibition entitled DeTerminationDaniel Pe≈°ta: DeTermination, DOX, 26. 1. ‚Äì 7. 5. 2018 at the DOX Centre for Contemporary Art in Prague in 2018.Burt Kimmelman, Provocative Art about Blood and Masks, Hyperallergic, April 15, 2018 He is married to Dadja Altenburg-Kohl. His daughter Karol√≠na Pe≈°tov√°-Matou≈°ov√° graduated in art theory at Charles University, Prague.  Work  Before 1989, Daniel Pe≈°ta worked as a graphic designer. He created around a hundred covers for classical music records and won awards for book and poster design (1st prize for a political poster, Mexico, 1990).Daniel Pe≈°ta, in: Die Unsterblichkeit der Sterne, p.110, Kunstmuseum Solingen 2010, Since the early 1990s his main focus has been figurative and portrait painting and thanks to his artistic dexterity Pe≈°ta developed an easily recognizable style. He soon abandoned hyperrealistic painting in favor of a raw, expressive style, more closely reflecting his nature. Pe≈°ta‚Äôs art is very intuitive, influenced by social themes and politics, reflecting the vulnerability of the individual and the internal complexity of the human being. He is unafraid of taking risks, as any work of art is also the expression of his radical social and political stance. The themes of his work touch upon the essence of human existence and the role of the individual in human society, often with social or political subtext and an emphasis on the risks of abuse of power. One of Pe≈°ta's central motifs is a mask. He sees it as a symbol of pretence or the loss of individual identity. When multiplied, the masks are shapeless forms with no specific features, no story, wherein a person becomes a statistic item.Zem√°nkov√° T, DeTermination, 2018, p. 16 In 1998, Pe≈°ta went on his first study trip to New York. This contact with the international art scene radically influenced his work, and he started to create sculptures and hanging installations in addition to painting, experimenting with wax, leather, textiles, or recycled photographs as part of naturalist assemblages. Since 2004, his favorite material has been clear epoxy resin, which he uses to cover older paintings and objects, thus conserving and devaluating them all at once. Later, he used the same technique for extensive photographic installations in the cycle Genetic Codes (I-IV, 2008-2013), the monumental work V√°clav Havel‚Äôs Wheels of Time (2011-2016), a commemoration of V√°clav Havel on permanent exhibition at the Church of St. Anne in Prague,Zem√°nkov√° T, En Bloc, 2018, p. 118 the set of objects themed Ecce Homo (2004-2011) and Christ (2011), and the series of 21 assemblages Nocturnal Head Records (2012-2015), which represent a summary of the key themes of his work. In the Records series, Pe≈°ta combines old and new photographs with painting, woven nets and bizarre objects of uncertain origin. Some visions are sharp and present, others foggy and pushed into oblivion. According to the principles of dream logics, reality blends with childhood memory, and the series recounts a life from birth, through adolescence, erotic tension, fear and guilt, to unfulfilled expectations, exhaustion and fear of death.Zem√°nkov√° T, DeTermination, 2018, p. 77 Video art became an important part of Pe≈°ta‚Äôs work in 2009. In his expressive piece Narcissus (2010), he used the mask of his own face to represent his uncomfortable and limiting \\"alter ego‚Äù, ultimately eaten up and swallowed. A similar video entitled Scream (2010), part of an entire cycle of metaphoric works dealing with boundary states of the human existence,V√Ωk≈ôik je mezn√≠ situace, na kterou jsme si zvykli, tvrd√≠ v√Ωtvarn√≠k Daniel Pe≈°ta, interview with T. Zem√°nkov√°, Czech Radio, March 12, 2018 ends with a mouth being symbolically sewn shut. In the video art piece Chain (2017), a group of men in white shirts takes in a secret society or sect initiation rite of sorts, receiving fire from their leader, and rhythmically pound the table in front of them with hands burning. The image is a metaphor for the manipulation of the individual, who becomes ready to sacrifice himself in the name of an ideology.Zem√°nkov√° T, DeTermination, 2018, p. 101 The human condition, seen by Daniel Pe≈°ta as desperate, Sisyphean endeavor, is reflected in the video art series From Nowhere to Nowhere (2017). It shows naked individuals trapped in a transparent cube, whose only option is to keep moving the cage forward, without chance to escape it. The video entitled A Drop (2017) shows a human eye subjected to endless tiny suffering of the daily life, represented by drops of water, dripping in regular intervals. Zem√°nkov√° T, DeTermination, 2018, p. 41 Pe≈°ta interprets freely some Christian symbols and puts them in new contexts. The figure of Jesus Christ is portrayed in an epoxy block as Jesus in Amniotic Liquid, not as an embryo but as the one predetermined to the inevitable fate of crucifixion. There is no definite interpretation for the assemblage of crucifix fragments (Puzzle II, 2000-2017) or the raised hand of Jesus statues, protruding from a resin cube (Memento 2, 2019) - they could represent a symbol of suffering as well as a victorious gesture.ArtinBox Gallery: Daniel Pe≈°ta The body of Christ, taken from the cross, is presented as a mummy covered in beeswax, the Annunciation looks like an extraterrestrial androgynous being with child (Annunciation, 2014, 2018). The pulsating light projects crown of thorns onto a heap of salt, in the rhythm of a woman breathing, reminiscent of the seven dolors of Virgin Mary (White Zone, 2010).Zem√°nkov√° T, DeTermination, 2018, p. 167 Pe≈°ta‚Äôs work often points to the mannerisms of the narcissist leaders, the hypocrisy of the church, or the indifference of the spineless individuals which had caused tragedies such as the holocaust, but also reflect upon the problems of the contemporary society, e.g. the stigmatization of minorities.V√Ωstava Daniela Pe≈°ty - DeTermination v DOXu, ƒåTK, 30.1.2018 At the 2013 Venice Biennale, Pe≈°ta presented the alarming video project I Was Born in Your Bed, attempting to challenge the societal stereotypes which categorize Romani people based on the color of their skin and push them to the fringes of society. The video was accompanied by a series of portraits of Romani children, whose questioning looks force the viewer to think (I Am Gypsy, and You?). The duo of seemingly similar neon signs: I Was Born in Your Bed - I Was Born in Your Head posits the question whether an individual‚Äôs fate is determined by origin or by social conventions. Determination by place of birth, when the unequal conditions at the start of one‚Äôs life often influence their place in the world, is confronted with the general consciousness, subject to stereotyping and born out of societal manipulation.Zem√°nkov√° T, DeTermination, 2018, p. 129 The theme of human predetermination and the ability or even chance to escape societal paradigms was latently present in all Pe≈°ta‚Äôs installations and videos shown in his prestigious solo exhibition covering two floors of the DOX Gallery (2018).Hana Sl√≠vov√°, Zlo ani dobro se nerod√≠ jinde ne≈æ v lidsk√© hlavƒõ, p≈ôipom√≠n√° velk√° v√Ωstava Daniela Pe≈°ty, Aktu√°lnƒõ.cz, 26.1.2018 Analysis of human subconsciousness and predetermination makes central theme of the cycle Genetic Codes - assemblages of photographs from old albums, covered in resin, resembling tiny reliquaries and installed like a mosaic in monumental hanging blocks in a style evocative of DNA sequencing. The faces and figures of people who were once specific individuals become links in a chain, in which the fate of future individuals is determined by their origin or their social roles (Genetic Code - Brides, 2008-2009, - Carmens, 2012-2013). The counterpart of the installation Feminine Element, consisting of photographs of women in seductive poses, is the piece entitled Alpha Wolf, illustrating male behavior stereotypes through photographs of wolves. Mask as a cast of a face is seen by Pe≈°ta not only as a symbol of pretense but also as record of specific expression, used by humans as a sophisticated tool for self-presentation.Daniel Pe≈°ta, in: Zem√°nkov√° T, DeTermination, 2018, p. 26 That is the effect of assemblages entitled Puzzle, in which masks convey a wide range of facial expressions. The project Gravitation zero (2011) used masks lit from within, torn from static figures of monks and floating in space. The work has no simple interpretation - the masks can represent enlightenment as well as absolute depersonalization. The chilling vision of anonymous, lifeless masks which form the three cubes of Angels Will Survive (2011), installed in the future memorial of Jewish transports at the train station Bubny, is a counterpart to the installation of the personal possessions of the victims from Auschwitz.Artmix, Czech TV, 7.11.2017 In his series of ‚Äúgroup portraits,‚Äù Pe≈°ta focuses on the ruinous psychology of manipulated crowds or the loss of individuality (Jan and Anna, diptych, 2017). His work reflects an ease by which an autocrat finds imaginary enemies in a minority, whether defined by religion, skin color or alternative lifestyle, and conjure up fear or psychosis to manipulate. With expressive hyperbole, heads of voters are reduced to grimaces with crying mouths and stuck-out thumbs (Election, 2016-2017).Daniel Pe≈°ta, in: Zem√°nkov√° T, DeTermination, 2018, p. 102 The extreme emotion, which could mean anything from terror, helplessness, unbearable pain to rage, is portraid in the series of paintings entitled Scream (2015-2016). Pe≈°ta is a complicated artist to interpret, as he transcends formal realism, communicating through a unique combination of inspirational sources resulting in an ingenious vision of an intrinsically timeless art.Timothy Warrington: Daniel Pe≈°ta - The Critique, International Confederation of Art Critics File:Daniel Pe≈°ta, Narcis, videoart, 2011.jpgDaniel Pe≈°ta, Narcissus, videoart, Felix-Nussbaum-Haus, Osnabr√ºck, 2011 File:Daniel Pe≈°ta, I was born in your bed 1., videoart, 2013.jpgDaniel Pe≈°ta, I was born in your bed 1., videoart, 2013 File:Daniel Pe≈°ta, I was born in your bed 2., 2013.jpgDaniel Pe≈°ta, I was born in your bed 2., 2013 File:Daniel Pe≈°ta, Volby, 2016-2017.jpgDaniel Pe≈°ta, Elections, acryl on canvas, 270 x 180 cm, 2016/2017 File:Daniel Pe≈°ta, Zvƒõstov√°n√≠ ƒç.1., 2015.jpgDaniel Pe≈°ta, Annunciation No. 1., fabric, leather, wax, 2015 File:Daniel Pe≈°ta, V√Ωk≈ôik ƒç.3., 2015-2017.jpgDaniel Pe≈°ta, Scream No.3., acryl on canvas, 200 x 220 cm, 2015/2017 File:Daniel Pe≈°ta, Bo≈æ√≠ ml√Ωnky V√°clava Havla, 2011-2016.jpgDaniel Pe≈°ta, V√°clav Havel‚Äôs Wheels of Time, permanent installation, authentic roses saved at VH burial, Prague Crossroads spiritual center, Church of St. Anne, Prague File:Daniel Pe≈°ta, Andƒõl√© p≈ôe≈æij√≠, 2017.jpgDaniel Pe≈°ta, Angels Survive, soapy mass, Bubny (Jewish) memorial of Silence, Bubny, Prague, 2017 File:Daniel Pe≈°ta, DeTermination, DOX, Centrum souƒçasn√©ho umƒõn√≠, 2018.jpgDaniel Pe≈°ta, DeTermination, DOX, Centre for Contemporary Art, 2018 File:Daniel Pe≈°ta, DeTermination (2), DOX, Centrum souƒçasn√©ho umƒõn√≠, 2018.jpgDaniel Pe≈°ta, DeTermination (2), DOX, Centre for Contemporary Art, 2018 File:Daniel Pe≈°ta, Ecce Homo, akryl na pl√°tnƒõ, 190 x 1500 cm, 2018 - 2019.jpgDaniel Pe≈°ta, Ecce Homo, acryl on canvas, 190 x 1500 cm, 2018 - 2019 File:Daniel Pe≈°ta, Stƒõna ≈æivota - Wall of Life, epoxidov√° prysky≈ôice, 240 x 450 cm, 20017 - 2020.jpgDaniel Pe≈°ta, Wall of Life, epoxy resin, 240 x 450 cm, 20017 - 2020  Awards  * 1990 Mexico City Biennale 1, award in the category of Political Poster, Mexico * 2001 Florence Biennale 3, award in the category of new media, Florence, Italy * 2002 Most Beautiful Book of the Year, award in the bibliophile category, Tom√°≈° Hr√°ch, Ka≈°p√°rk≈Øv konec, Argo, Prague * 2009 Most Beautiful Book of the Year, nomination in the catalogue category, Prague * 2014 Now&After; International Video Art Festival, Gulag Museum, Honorable MentionNow&After; International Video Art Festival, the State Museum of GULAG: Daniel Pe≈°ta * 2017 London Art Biennale, 2nd prize for painting * 2019 London Art Biennale, 2nd prize for expressionist art  Exhibitions  Solo (selection) = * 1993 Concave Paintings, Karolinum, Prague * 1995 Convex Paintings, Axiom Gallery, Cheltenham * 1998 Daniel Pe≈°ta in Montserrat Gallery 1, New York City * 2000 Daniel Pe≈°ta in Montserrat Gallery 2, New York City * 2002 White Zone, Critics' Gallery, Prague * 2005 Hot Doks 1 (with V√°clav Bl√°ha), AusstellungsHalle, Frankfurt am Main * 2005 Hot Doks 2 (with V√°clav Bl√°ha), Galerie Palais am Festungsgraben Berlin * 2007 Sweet Home, Akropolis, Prague * 2010 Black Light, Galerie Maier-Hahn, D√ºsseldorf * 2010 Levitation, Museum Montanelli, Prague * 2011 Levitation, Felix-Nussbaum-Haus - Kulturgeschichtliches Museum, Osnabr√ºck * 2012 Gravitation Zero, Kunstmuseum Solingen, Solingen * 2012 On Another Planet (In the name of love‚Ä¶) (with Suzanne Pastor), Artinbox gallery, Prague * 2013 Kunst in der Katastrophe, Deutscher Bundestag, Berlin * 2013 I was born in your bed, Sala del Camino, Venice * 2014 I was born in your bed, J√≠zd√°rna Z√°meck√©ho n√°vr≈°√≠, Litomy≈°l * 2015 Art Biennale, Palazzo Bembo (Personal Structures), Venice * 2016 Nocturnal Head Records, White Gallery, Os√≠k near Litomy≈°l * 2018 DeTermination, DOX centre for Contemporary Art, Prague = Group (selection) = * 2007 Prague Biennale 3, Karlin Hall, Prague * 2009 Prague Biennale 4, Karlin Hall, Prague * 2010 Francisco de Goya ‚Äì Vision of Symptoms and Hope, Kunstmuseum Solingen, Solingen * 2011 The Art of Birth, Artinbox gallery, Prague * 2012 Maria, Maria, Felix-Nussbaum-Haus - Kulturgeschichtliches Museum, Osnabr√ºck * 2012 Turn On, Tune In, Factory Art Gallery, Berlin * 2012 It‚Äôs Liquid Identities.

After that war, high Qing officials like Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang, and Wenxiang (the latter a Manchu) tried to acquire advanced western weapons and to copy western military organization. Founded by Wenxiang and manned by mostly Manchu Bannermen, the soldiers most loyal to the dynasty, the Force was armed with Russian rifles and French cannon and drilled by British officers. The \\"First Historical Archives of China\\" () in Beijing hold a collection of primary documents on the Peking Field Force. Name The Chinese name of the battalions is Shenji ying, in which shenji means \\"divine mechanism\\" and ying either \\"military camp\\", \\"battalion\\", or \\"regiment\\". The Qing force had the same name as the Shenjiying, a Ming-era (1368‚Äì1644) military corps that specialized in training with firearms. The Ming division has been variously referred to as \\"Divine Mechanism Battalions\\", \\"Firearms Division\\", \\"Artillery Camp\\", \\"Shen-chi Camp\\", and \\"Firearm Brigade\\". or \\"Divine Engine Division\\". The Qing army corps also named \\"Shenji ying\\" is sometimes called the \\"Metropolitan Field Force\\", but is mostly known as the \\"Peking Field Force\\", the name by which foreigners referred to it in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

With a combined apparent visual magnitude of 5.16, it is faintly visible to the naked eye. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 36.66 mas as seen from Earth, the system is located 89 light years distant from the Sun. It has a relatively high proper motion, advancing across the celestial sphere at the rate of 0.524 arcseconds per year. The primary, component A, is a yellow-white hued F-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of F6 V. However, Frasca et al. (2009) lists it as a somewhat more evolved F-type subgiant star with a class of F7 IV. At the age of 2.7 billion years, it has an inactive chromosphere and is spinning with a leisurely projected rotational velocity of 3 km/s. It has a faint, magnitude 13.23 red dwarf companion, designated component B, at an angular separation of 248 arc seconds. The system is most likely (96% chance) a member of the thin disk population of the Milky Way.

It is a close binary composed of a red giant and white dwarf, estimated to be around 2.5 and 0.6 times the mass of the Sun respectively. It is classified as a symbiotic nova; it has undergone one extremely slow nova outburst and a smaller outburst. Initially a magnitude 9 star, AG Pegasi brightened and peaked at an apparent magnitude of 6.0 around 1885 before gradually fading to magnitude 9 in the late 20th century. Its spectrum was noted by earlier observers to resemble P Cygni. The spectrum of the hotter star has changed drastically over 160 years, leading investigators Scott Kenyon and colleagues to surmise that its hotter component, originally a white dwarf, accumulated enough material from the donor giant star to begin burning hydrogen and enlarge and brighten into an A-type white supergiant around 1850. It had this spectrum and an estimated surface temperature of around 10000 K in 1900, with a likely radius 16 times that of the Sun, before becoming a B-class star in 1920, then an O-class star in 1940, and finally a Wolf-Rayet star in 1970, with a surface temperature of 95000 K since 1978. It has shrunk to star with a diameter 1.1 times that of the Sun in 1949, then 0.15 times in 1978 and 0.08 times that of the Sun in 1990. AG Pegasi has been described as the slowest nova ever recorded, with a constant bolometric luminosity of the hotter star over 130 years from 1850 to 1980. By the late 20th century, the hotter star has evolved into a hot subdwarf on its way to eventually returning to white dwarf status. Vogel and colleagues calculated the hotter star must have been accreting material from the red giant for around 5000 years before erupting. Both stars are ejecting material in stellar winds. The resulting nebula contains material from both stars and is complex in nature. From 1997 until 2015, AG Pegasi entered a quiescent phase with no further change to its brightness. Then the hot component increased in temperature, which caused the nebulosity around the stars to become more ionised and increase in brightness. The combination of the extremely slow nova and smaller outburst means that Z Andromedae is classed as a symbiotic nova.

Early life Andrew Fezza was born in 1955 in Connecticut, and studied biology and sociology at Boston College with the intention of becoming a dentist. Following a visit to Florence where he saw Italian fashions first hand, he enrolled at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York where he met his future wife, Marilyn. Career After graduation, Fezza worked as a design assistant for the womenswear company Schrader Sport on Seventh Avenue, while producing a line of men's sweaters in the evenings that were bought by the New York menswear shop 'Camouflage'. In 1979, he and his future wife, Marilyn, launched their apparel company in a small apartment in Greenwich Village, specializing in men's sportswear and leather clothing. They added a womenswear line in 1984, which was designed by Marilyn. Andrew Fezza was presented by the GFT USA Corporation (a subsidiary of the Italian company Gruppo GFT), which had already provided support to the successful designers Emanuel Ungaro, Louis F√©raud and Valentino, and launched Giorgio Armani to fame. GFT, who in 1988, retailed Armani suits for $700‚Äì900 apiece, wanted to offer comparable quality but lower-priced (at $300‚Äì400) suits to the consumer with a tighter clothing budget, and following market research, decided that their new line needed a name designer, ideally a young American creating European-style garments. Fezza fit this profile, and as he was not a \\"big star\\", would not cost GFT too much money to acquire. His Firma line, offering the Armani look for lower prices, was a commercial success, and Fezza, according to the GFT marketing and image people, was \\"a designer people can relate to.\\" Although the Firma line was in demand, GFT were careful to limit its availability, stating in 1988 that they were \\"building a whole romantic image [...] creating a hero\\" and wanted to keep the line exclusive and avoid overselling. By 1992, Andrew and Marilyn Fezza were taking in $21 million a year in clothing sales. In 1992, Fezza left GFT, launching his solo collections for spring 1993. His plan was to shift the focus of the Andrew Fezza brand to sportswear rather than tailoring, and offer more unisex clothing under his Fez brand, which he introduced in 1991. He also reduced prices, making his products more affordable, selling shirts for $75 rather than $150, and sport coats for $175 to $325, rather than $375‚Äì550. In 2010, Andrew and Marilyn created a multimedia production company called Seven Sisters Productions, LLC. 7Sisters Media is a global female empowerment platform \\"designed to disrupt mainstream media and create intelligent, meaningful programming tailored to young women.\\" Awards In 1984, Fezza was the last recipient of the Coty Award for menswear.Coty Awards discontinued after 4 decades, Daily News Record, June 1985 His win was seen as significant as the Coty Awards had been criticized for becoming too predictable. Fezza had previously been nominated in 1981, when he received a Menswear Special Award following an executive decision by the organisers that, as Calvin Klein, Geoffrey Beene, and Ralph Lauren had all rejected their Cotys, all nominees would receive an award. Fezza has also received the Council of Fashion Designers of America Award for Menswear, the Cutty Sark Award for Outstanding Designer, and the Chrysler/Cartier Stargazer Award for Best New American Designer.

The tower has a square base. At the top, there are 3 battlements visible. Lund's Tower is a stone-built folly situated to the south-west of the North Yorkshire village of Sutton-in-Craven. It is also known as the Sutton Pinnacle, the Ethel Tower, the Jubilee Tower or, in conjunction with the nearby Wainman's Pinnacle, the pair are referred to as the Salt and Pepper Pots. It is listed in the National Heritage List for England at Grade II. History James Lund (1829‚Äì1903) commissioned the Keighley architectural firm of R. B. Broster & Sons to design the tower, which was built in 1887. Different reasons have been given for why Lund wanted the folly built: local residents refer to it as the Ethel Tower, believing it was constructed either to celebrate the birth of Lund's daughter Ethel ‚Äì or her 21st birthday; others refer to it as the Jubilee Tower, believing it commemorated the 1887 jubilee of Queen Victoria. It is also known as Sutton Pinnacle. Lund was the son of William Lund, the owner of William Lund & Son, a large textile manufacturing business. In 1852, James Lund married Mary Sarah Spencer, the daughter of William Spencer, a wealthy landowner. The construction of Lund Mausoleum in Utley Cemetery, Keighley was also commissioned by Lund in 1895. Malsis Hall at Cross Hills and Ellerton Hall beside York were also owned by Lund. A new Malsis Hall was built by him in 1862 and became Malsis School in 1920. When Lund died in January 1903, his estate totalled ¬£606,679, equivalent to about ¬£62,468,366 as of 2012. Set on the top of Earl Crag, Lund's Tower is in the same vicinity as Wainman's Pinnacle, which is also Grade II listed but constructed in 1898 to commemorate the Napoleonic Wars. The pair of monuments are known locally as the Salt and Pepper Pots. The tower received Grade II listing in the National Heritage List for England in October 1984 under the designation number 1131781.

He was deputy leader of the first Indian successful Everest Expedition scaled the Mount Everest on 1965. He is known for the mountaineering reconnaissance expedition he undertook in Teram Kangri, Siachen Glacier and Saltoro Range for the Indian Army in 1978 at the age of 45. If he had not undertaken this expedition, all of Siachen Glacier would be Pakistan's. That is an area covering almost , but because of his expedition, India conquered all the entire area. Kumar crossed seven mountain ranges‚ÄîPir Panjal Range, Himalayas, Zanskar, Ladakh, Saltoro, Karakoram and Agil‚Äîto give India Siachen.  Early life  Narendra was born in Rawalpindi, British India in 1933. He has three more brothers who all joined Indian Army. His skirmishes with history began in 1947,when Narinder represented Punjab state at a scouts jamboree in Paris at the age of 13. The team of 50 scouts was returning by ship, when news of Independence broke over them like a tsunami. \\"All of us, Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus, decided to design a flag,\\" he says. \\"We put the Union Jack in the Centre, India and Pakistan on either side.\\" They wanted to sing a national song, but which one? So in just-broken voices, \\"we sang‚Ä¶ tera sahara.\\" One night, he thought a ship engine had failed. Next morning, he found all Muslims had been asked to disembark in Karachi. Narinder got off in alien Bombay and went to Shimla, where his parents had migrated after partition of India. Narendra's youngest brother Major K.I. Kumar ascended Mount Everest in 1985, but died after falling from 8,500 m.  Army life and mountaineering  Narendra Kumar entered the Indian Army in 1950. He took part in boxing, riding and cycle-polo during his years of training. He was commissioned in Kumaon Rifles in June 1954 and then became interested in winter sports and mountaineering. He earned \\"Bull\\" sobriquet at the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun, during the first boxing match he fought. His rival was a senior cadet, Sunith Francis Rodrigues, who went on to become the Chief of the Army Staff. Kumar lost the bout, but helped earning himself a nickname: \\"Bull.\\" The nickname \\"Bull\\" comes from his tendency to charge relentlessly into whatever he does. The mountain bond was born when Colonel Kumar met Tenzing Norgay, director of the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute, in Darjeeling. In March 1958, Narendra led the successful Army and Navy expedition to Mt. Trisul (23,360 ft). He also scaled Kabru Dome (21,780 ft) in 1959 and Yellow Needle Peak (22,480 ft) in 1960. He was the first Indian to reach up to 28,700 ft, in his first attempt at climbing the Mount Everest in 1960, before having to turn back due to inclement weather. In 1961, Kumar led a harrowing 5-men expedition to climb Neelkanth (21,644 ft) in the Garhwal Himalayas. While descending from the summit,Kumar lost four of his toes due to frostbite and stopped 200m short of the summit. In 1964, he was first Indian to scale Nanda Devi. In 1965, he was deputy leader of a team that put nine Indian Army climbers at the top of the world's tallest peak. Capt. Mohan Singh Kohli, who led the 1965 Everest expedition, said Kumar's climbing career was \\"astonishing\\". He also scaled Mont Blanc (15,782 ft), the highest peak in the Alps in 1968. In 1970 he led the first recognised ascent of 23,997 ft Jomolhari (Chomo Lhari), the highest mountain in Bhutan. Kumar successfully climbed the Kangchenjunga from the toughest north-east spur in 1977. Kumar followed up his 1981 Siachen feats with the challenge, as Antarctica Task Force member, of acclimatising the First Indian Expedition there, led by Dr. S. Z. Qasim in 1982. Training was carried out at Dras, where temperatures touch minus 56 degrees Celsius. In 1983, Kumar conquered Kamet (25,595 ft) and Abi Gamin (24,272 ft). He superannuated on 1 January 1984 but that did not slow him down. Later,Kumar was put in \\"permanent category C\\" by the Indian Army, which meant no postings above 7,000 ft. Every time he was in the mountains, he had to give the government a non-liability certificate saying that he absolve them of all responsibilities should anything happen to him. He has entered the oxygen-depleted death zone above 8,000 m, twenty times. He spent 35 years in the Indian Army. Lieutenant General V. R. Raghavan, commanding officer of Operation Meghdoot, called Colonel Kumar 'a mountain of information'. He has shared a lifelong camaraderie with Tenzing Norgay.  Mountaineering expeditions to Siachen in 1978 and 1981  Kumar's involvement with the Siachen dates back to 1977, when he was approached by a German rafter who wanted to undertake the first descent of the Nubra River from its source at the snout of the glacier. The man brought Kumar a map of northeastern Kashmir that had an unusual feature. Beyond NJ9842,the map showed a dotted line connecting NJ9842 with Karakoram Pass.Kumar quickly asserted that it was Cartographic error. In January 1978, he took his findings to Lieutenant General M. L. Chibber, India's director of military operations.http://www.abplive.in/blog/how-india-discovered-importance-of- siachenhttp://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/academic-interest/why-india- has-to-fight-the-worlds-most-absurd-war/ Chibber quickly obtained permission for Kumar to mount a reconnaissance expedition to the Siachen. In 1978,Kumar, as commanding officer of the Indian Army's High Altitude Warfare School, joined two German explorers in an attempt to navigate the upper reaches of the Indus river in Ladakh. Two years later, one of his former co-travellers returned to India and asked Kumar to join him in an expedition to the Nubra Valley, which separates Ladakh from the Karakoram ranges. Kumar took one full batch of students(40 climbers and 30 porters) from the High Altitude Warfare School in 1978, saying that he is taking them for practical training. It was the first Indian expedition into the remote glacier. The team started at the snout of the glacier and reached glacier's halfway point, braving temperatures that dipped to ‚àí50 degrees Celsius, and navigating tricky crevasses, peaks and passes‚Äîbound to each other with thick ropes. From there, a summit team of three completed an ascent of 24,631-foot Teram Kangri II, located on the southern edge of Shaksgam Valley. The Indian Air Force provided valuable support to this expedition through logistic support and supply of fresh rations. The team returned with the trash left behind by Pakistani expeditions as proof of their incursions. Unusually for the normally secretive Indian Army, the news and photographs of this expedition were published in The Illustrated Weekly of India, a widely circulated popular magazine. In April 1981, Kumar went back to Siachen Glacier with 70-member team with blank maps and a meagre budget of , this time covering it from its freezing snout(lowest point) at 11,946 ft to its icy source on the Saltoro Ridge (18,91 ft). He thus became the first person to scale the uncharted Siachen Glacier‚Äîthe world's third pole and second biggest glacier. In his salty style, Kumar said \\"Once you get the heights, you're the tiger. We put the tricolour at the farthest end of Siachen.\\" In the process, he summited Sia Kangri I(24,350 ft), India's northernmost point. In eight weeks, they climbed Saltoro Kangri I (25,400 feet) and Sia Kangri I (24,350 ft), hiked to the top of Indira Col at 24,493 ft(the watershed at the north end of the glacier), and skied to the passes on the Saltoro;Bilafond La, Saltoro Pass, Sia La, Turkistan La and Pass Italia. Later that year in 1983, Kumar published an account of his journeys in the newsmagazine Illustrated Weekly of India. The first public acknowledgment of the manoeuvres and the developing conflict situation in the Siachen was an abbreviated article titled \\"High Politics in the Karakoram\\" by Joydeep Sircar in The Telegraph newspaper of Calcutta in 1982. The full text was re-printed as \\"Oropolitics\\" in the Alpine Journal, London, in 1984.  Operation Meghdoot  Three years later, on 13 April 1984, the Indian Army launched its first major offensive attack, known as Operation Meghdoot against the Pakistani army at Siachen Glacier and established bases along the glacier. The detailed maps, plans, photographs and videos made by Kumar and his team, helped the Indian Army to conquer the whole of Siachen Glacier and also the area to the west of it, along with the main ridges and passes-Sia La (7,300m), Bilafond La (6,160m), Gyong La (5,640m), Yarma La (6,100m) and Chulung La (5,800m), along the Saltoro Range. The key Bilafond La (Pass of the Butterflies) is on the ancient Silk Route linking undivided India and China.  Personal life  He is married to Mridula. They have a daughter Shailaja Kumar(born 1964), India's first woman winter Olympian, who participated in 1988 in Calgary, Canada in Alpine skiing. and a son Akshay Kumar(born 1969), an adventure travel professional who runs Mercury Himalayan Explorations, one of the first rafting companies to navigate the Ganges and Brahmaputra. He now lives in Delhi. His son Akshay Kumar, CEO of Mercury Himalayan Expedition and former President of Adventure Tour Operators Association of India (ATOAI), passed away on 16th September 2020 in Delhi due to cardiac arrest.  Awards and recognition  On 25 June 2010, Narendra Kumar was honoured with the MacGregor Medal, awarded by the United Service Institution of India for the best military reconnaissance, exploration or survey in remote areas in India. On 1965 Narendra has been awarded Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India, and Arjuna Award for the first Indian successful Everest Expedition on 1965. He received awarded the IMF Gold Medal by the Indian Mountaineering Foundation. Narendra Kumar is only colonel with Param Vishisht Seva Medal (PVSM) distinction in all three services,which is generally accorded to generals. He was awarded the United Nation's fellowship for Ski Teaching and was trained in Switzerland and Austria for 4 months. In his efforts to launch river rafting in India, he made the first descent of Indus River in Ladakh and the Teesta in Sikkim. He has also been awarded Kirti Chakra and Ati Vishisht Seva Medal (ASVM). There is a Siachen Battalion HQ in Glacier named as \\"Kumar Base\\", a key forward logistics post at a height of 4,880 m.

During sleep or awake rest, replay refers to the re- occurrence of a sequence of cell activations that also occurred during activity, but the replay has a much faster time scale. It may be in the same order, or in reverse. Cases were also found where a sequence of activations occurs before the actual activity, but it is still the same sequence. This is called preplay. The phenomenon has mostly been observed in the hippocampus, a brain region associated with memory and spatial navigation. Specifically, the cells that exhibit this behavior are place cells, characterized by reliably increasing their activity when the animal is in a certain location in space. During navigation, the place cells fire in a sequence according to the path of the animal. In a replay instance, the cells are activated as if in response to the same spatial path, but at a much faster rate than the animal actually moved in.  Background  Place cell activity was already well established when the first study explored this phenomenon in 1989. They showed that neural activity of single place cells during sleep resembled the activity during the awake state. This activity was greater than that of other cells and this study was only the first step towards understanding replay. Subsequent studies showed that large groups of cells also demonstrated this type of increased activity during sleep. In addition, it was discovered that the order of activity of place cells was also replicated during sleep. Firing sequences of three and more neurons observed in the hippocampus during locomotion were shown to recur selectively during subsequent slow-wave sleep more likely than during the preceding sleep, and the sequence replay was compressed during high frequency oscillations. These high frequency field oscillations called ripples were observed in the sleep state and later shown to play a causal role in memory consolidation. The next step was the discovery of replay during the awake state. In 1999, ten years after the initial discovery, neural recordings in the awake state were also shown to have replay activity. It is considerably more difficult to detect this activity in the awake state and several methods including Bayesian decoding have been used to quantify replay events that occur during short wave ripples. Recent advances include finding that replay can occur in reverse and that it has also been found to occur in different environments. The role of replay in memory consolidation in these different conditions and environments is still being explored and several theories attempt to answer this question.  Location and behavioral state  Replay can occur in several different behavioral, physiological, and environmental conditions. The first distinction between awake and sleep states may represent different roles in memory consolidation. In the sleep state, the ripple events and place cell activity similar to that of the activity in the environment define the replay events. In the sleep state, there is also a distinction between REM (rapid eye movement) and SWS (slow wave sleep) which has implications for replay events. During SWS the place cells fire in a sequential order indicating replay and possibly indicate memory consolidation. However, during REM sleep where dreams occur in humans, replay events also occurred suggesting a possible role for place cells in dreams. In the awake state the same activity occurs, however it is more difficult to detect and the animal must be in a resting state. Lastly, there are many environments for replay events in the awake animal. The length of the track can be short or long and still be replayed by a population of place cells. In addition, replay of a single environment can occur when the animal is in that environment or in different environments. This may show that consolidation of memory is a persistent process that may occur in several different types of environments and behavioral conditions. The robustness of the replay events indicates the importance of this process.  Preplay  As mentioned above, the sequential activation of hippocampal place cells according to their place fields may occur during rest periods before the animal is actually traversing the activated path, even if the animal has never experienced it before. This suggests that hippocampal activation during rest may have a function not only in memory consolidation and retrieval, but also in planning: it contributes to the organization of the network for improving the encoding of future events.  Sensory cue for activation  Sensory stimuli can induce replay events or enhance the replay: in the awake state, replay often begins from the current location and continue either forward or backward in time, and nearby locations are more likely to be the place fields of neurons exhibiting replay than far away locations. This is like cued memory retrieval, where a sensory input triggers retrieval of similar or relevant memories. The cue may even trigger a replay in a different environment, if the place cells cued represent a location in a different environment in addition to the current location of the animal.  Interaction with cortex  Several studies are beginning to understand that replay may not only occur in the hippocampus. After learning, similar replay events occurred in both the thalamus and cortex. In addition, the visual cortex showed population activity that was both coordinated into discrete time regions and that it occurred simultaneously with activity in the hippocampus. Concurrent re-activation in the hippocampus and cortex may demonstrate that memory consolidation requires cortical input/output to maintain a memory. This hypothesis fits well with the idea that the cortex plays an integral role in memory retrieval after consolidation occurs. Therefore, hippocampal replay may play the role of information transfer between the hippocampus and cortex, yet this idea requires further verification.  Function in memory  Hippocampal replay in the awake state has been shown to correlate with performance in navigation tasks after the replay event. This suggest that replay plays a role in consolidation of memories related to spatial location, although a clear causal relationship between replay and memory consolidation is still unproven. Furthermore, replay also seems to be related to memory retrieval: it is activated by cues that also trigger memory retrieval, and in situations that require it, such as planning a trajectory based on the consequences of past choices. This relationship is also still only correlative, but there are studies showing evidence for the necessity of replay in successful memory retrieval. Replay is likely to participate in both the consolidation of memories and in building a cognitive map. Replay is also likely to play an important role in generating and maintaining a value map, which is a proposed variation of cognitive map in which memories are reinforced according to their values. In studies done to monitor the patterns of the hippocampal replay of events happening in the minds of the rats, it was discovered that they rely heavily on long term re- playable memories for their daily lives. To determine if the animals could really retain the memories scientists set up a series of episodic events (i.e. a series of tunnels, a maze, a track full of twists and turns) to visualize the neuron activity as the rat completes its round around the new surroundings. The chemogenetic activating drug clozapine N-oxide (CNO), but not vehicle, reversibly impairs episodic memory replay in rats previously injected bilaterally in the hippocampus with a recombinant viral vector containing an inhibitory designer receptor exclusively activated by a designer drug (DREADD; AAV8-hSyn-hM4Di-mCherry). By contrast, two non-episodic memory assessments are unaffected by CNO, showing selectivity of this hippocampal- dependent impairment.

Since 1975, he is based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. He is a founding member of Belfast's Bbeyond Performance Art International. before that he was a founder member of Belfast's Art and Research Exchange. He is member of the performance art collective Black Market International (BMI).. ArtBeat (2008-09-11) ArtBeat ‚Äì Alastair MacLennan. \\"Be it quick, or be it slow, everything transitions, everything interfuses.\\" He studied at the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design of the University of Dundee in 1960-65. 1966-68 he received his Master of Fine Arts from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago. He now is Emeritus Professor in Fine Art, University of Ulster in Belfast, Honorary Fellow of the Dartington College of Arts, Devon, and Honorary Associate of the National Review of Live Art, Glasgow. He retired from his professorship in 2008 and continues as Emeritus professor for Fine Art, University of Ulster. MacLennan's live work is prevailingly long durational. Early on Maclennan decided never to contract with a gallery or commercial dealer formally. He believed his art is a spiritual practise where the artist shares the whole process with the public who experience the process as it is created, not just an artwork but a process of exploration and discovery. There should be no separation between the process and the making and the final result; it must remain all one. In later years Maclennan evolved a practise informed by Zen insights. Maclennan has a worldwide following among artists, critics, and art historians. One outcome of how MacLennan's practise is that he did not build relationships with museums. The Ulster Museum has 129 works on paper. More than 100 are in the Demarco European Art Foundation Archive, Edinburgh. Another large cache of drawings and objects are in the Summerhall Arts Collection, Edinburgh. Several publications are being planned to give a history and complete overview of MacLennan's seminal history. He is very probably the world's most experienced performance artist. It is inconceivable that any other has performed so often or in so many different parts of the world. Maclennan says, as is also true of the great performance artist Joseph Beuys, all his performances are part of a single gesamtkunstwerk continuum. Alastair MacLennan represented Ireland at the Venice Biennale, with inter- media work commemorating the names of all those who died as a result of the Political Troubles in Northern Ireland, from 1969 to then date (1997). During the 1970s and 1980s he made some long, non-stop performances in Britain, America and Canada, of up to 144 hours duration. Subject matter dealt with political, social and cultural malfunction. In recent years he has traveled extensively in Europe, Asia, North America and Canada, presenting Actuations (performance/installations). Since 1989 he has been a member of the performance art entity, Black Market International, which performs globally. During the 1970s and 1980s he presented long durational performances in Britain and America, of up to 144 hours. His work looks into political, social, religious, ethical and aesthetical questions. He has performed since 1972 more than 600 art performances in countries across the world, in galleries, museums, festivals and public spaces. His most recent performances were in the 2017 Edinburgh Festival including performing with Sandra Johnston at Summerhall alongside his second retrospective of works on paper and objects and installations relating to his performances entitled Lie To Lay and a catalogue entitled Air A Lair. His first retrospective was at The Ormeau Baths Gallery Belfast with a catalogue publication called Knot Knot, 2003. Maclennan performs often with Sandra Johnston. She is an artist from Northern Ireland working in areas of site-responsive performance that like Maclennan explores creative responses in the aftermath of trauma, such as, acts of commemoration that exist as forms of testimony and empathetic encounter. Johnston is the ‚ÄòR√© Soupault‚Äô Guest Professor at the Bauhaus University, Weimar, and Course Leader of the BxNU MFA at Northumbria University, England, and is also a co-founder of artist-run collectives in Belfast, Catalyst & Beyond.

She has been reviewed positively by some important critics and art historians, such as Guido Ballo, Bruno Munari, Gillo Dorfles, Arturo Schwarz, Francesco Tedeschi, Flaminio Gualdoni and Tommaso Trini. Del Ponte's work has been described as being suspended between art and science, through studies that investigate the relationship between sculpture, music, science and technology. Her international debut in the 1970s won First Prize for Sculpture at the S√£o Paulo Art Biennial.  Early life and education  Del Ponte was born in Milan in 1936. Between 1956 and 1961, she studied sculpture under Marino Marinihttp://farahzadart.com/080109.html at the Accademia di Brera in Milan with Kengiro Azuma, Mario Robaudi and Gianni Colombo. In the 1960s, she started her research on materials. Her approach, almost scientific, led Del Ponte to create simple and pure structures. Career In 1965 Amalia Del Ponte made her first sculptures in Plexiglas, based on an analysis of basic geometric shapes. Two years later Vittorio Fagone named these works Tropi during a solo show at Galleria Vismara in Milano. http://www.amaliadelponte.org/AmaliaDelPonte/tropi.html http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1994/gennaio/30/esperimenti_con_musica_co_0_9401306877.shtml In the 1960s Del Ponte also designed the interiors of the fashion boutique Gulp! in Milan, and Elio Fiorucci's first shop. Del Ponte received international acclaim in 1973 when she was invited by Bruno Munari and Umbro Apollonio to participate at S√£o Paulo Art Biennial (at that time one of the most important in the world) where she won First Prize for Sculpture with her work Area percettiva.http://issuu.com/bienal/docs/namee1bdf4 In 1993, Del Ponte exhibited some of her lithophones at Fort Asperen in the Netherlands.

Each volume generally covers a six-month period of a given administration and presents content in chronological order, with headings providing the dates of the documents or events. In instances when the release date differs from the date of the document itself, the date of public release is shown in the textnote.  Methodology  Remarks are checked against an audio recording (if available) or read aloud against official transcripts (if no audio source is available), and signed documents are checked against the original with exacting attention paid to preserving the integrity of the signed document. Textnotes and cross references are provided by the editors for purposes of identification or clarity, usually of notable people referred to by the President or others participating in an event. Speeches are assumed to have been delivered in Washington, DC, unless otherwise indicated in the item heading. The times noted are assumed to be local times. All materials printed in full text in the book are indexed in the subject and name indexes and listed in the document categories list. With few exceptions, deceased people are not indexed by name. The notes are intended for the general reader, and specific criteria govern decisions about inclusion in or exclusion from the note with an eye toward keeping references standardized, succinct, and useful.  History  The Public Papers of the Presidents series was begun in 1957 in response to a recommendation of the National Historical Publications Commission. An extensive compilation of messages and papers of the Presidents covering the period 1789 to 1897 was assembled by James D. Richardson and published under congressional authority between 1896 and 1899. Since then, various private compilations have been issued, but there was no uniform publication comparable to the Congressional Record or the United States Supreme Court Reports. Many Presidential papers could be found only in the form of mimeographed White House releases or as reported in the press. The Commission therefore recommended the establishment of an official series in which Presidential writings, addresses, and remarks of a public nature could be made available. The Commission‚Äôs recommendation was incorporated in regulations of the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register, issued under section 6 of the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. 1506), which may be found in title 1, part 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations.  Related Publications  Another special edition of the Federal Register arose as a companion publication to the Public Papers series, the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents, which was first published in 1965 to provide a broader range of Presidential materials on a more timely basis to meet the needs of the contemporary reader. Beginning with the administration of Jimmy Carter, the Public Papers series expanded its coverage to include additional material as printed in the Weekly Compilation, including detailed appendices of supplemental material: Digest of Other White House Announcements, Nominations Submitted to the Senate, Checklist of White House Press Releases, and Presidential Documents Published in the Federal Register.  Online Access  On January 20, 2009, the printed Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents was superseded by the online Daily Compilation of Presidential Documents. The Daily Compilation provides a listing of the President‚Äôs daily schedule and meetings, when announced, and other items of general interest issued by the Office of the Press Secretary. In 2012, the Government Printing Office and the Office of the Federal Register released a mobile web application (http://m.gpo.gov/dcpd) that catalogues the daily public activities of the President of the United States and enhances features of the online Daily Compilation with user-friendly search capability, allowing users to access Presidential content by date, category, subject, or location.  Scope and Availability  Volumes covering the administrations of Presidents Herbert Hoover, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, William J. Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama are also included in the Public Papers series.

She is counted as the first professional female actor in the Ottoman Empire and thereby the Middle East. Life Arousyak Papazian was born in Constantinople, Ottoman Empire, in 1841. Before becoming an actress, she worked as a teacher. In the 1850s, the modern theatre was founded in the Ottoman Empire by an Armenian theatre company, and Papazian was reportedly the first female actor to perform in the Hekimian theatre company in 1857. She was engaged at the Arevelian Tatron (Oriental Theater) and she also toured with the company, such as to Izmir in 1867. As Muslims did not consider acting a suitable profession, the first actors in the Ottoman Empire were Christian Armenians, and the stigma of the profession was especially the case for females, the actresses received a higher salary than their male colleagues, and they could also continue their careers undisturbed after the Armenian theatre monopoly was abolished in the Ottoman Empire in 1879; after this point, male Armenian actors found competition from Muslim Turkish male actors, while no Muslim Turkish female actor ever performed on stage before 1919. Arousyak Papazian became the first leading lady and female star of the Ottoman theatre and received considerable praise. She and her colleague Aghavni Papazian are mentioned by the historian Mikael Nalbandian as two pioneers in defying prejudices by performing on stage in the Muslim Middle East. As such, they became publicly visible women in the Muslim Ottoman Empire in a period when the female members of the audience had to watch their plays from behind screens. Arousyak Papazian retired after her marriage because of her spouse was opposed to her theatrical career. She died in Constantinople in 1907.

Cotroni was born in 1911, in Mammola, Calabria, Italy. In 1924, he immigrated to Montreal, Quebec, Canada. In his early life, he worked as a professional wrestler under the name \\"Vic Vincent\\". By the age of 20 Cotroni had accumulated a lengthy record of minor offenses, bootlegging with local bootlegger Armand Courville. In 1928, Cotroni was charged with rape against Maria Bresciano. The charge was dropped when Maria agreed to marry him in May 1928, and later had a child, Rosina. Throughout his life, Cotroni kept a low profile. In 1974, Cotroni was subpoenaed to stand before a Quebec government commission inquiry into organized crime and was jailed for one year for contempt. The following year, Cotroni and his capodecina Paolo Violi, along with Hamilton, Ontario mobster Johnny Papalia, were convicted of extortion and sentenced to six years in prison; Cotroni's sentence was later reduced on appeal to just six months. In the late 1970s, Cotroni transferred the day-to-day activities of the family to Violi together with his brother Frank, Nicolas Dilorio, and Luigi Greco. As tension grew with power struggle between the Calabrian and Sicilian factions led by Nicolo Rizzuto, a mob war began. The war resulted in the murder of Violi in 1978, as well as his brothers, as the Sicilian Rizzuto crime family emerged as the preeminent crime family in Montreal by the early 1980s. On September 16, 1984, Cotroni died of cancer. Early life Cotroni was born in 1911, in Mammola, Calabria, Italy. In 1924, he immigrated to Montreal, Quebec, Canada with his two sisters, Marguerita and Palmina, and his brother Giuseppe; his two other brothers, Frank and Michel, were later born in Montreal. Cotroni grew up in a house at the junction of Ontario and St. Timothe√© streets in Montreal, in a poor neighborhood that more affluent Italian immigrants avoided because of its high crime rate.Auger and Edwards The Encyclopedia of Canadian Organized Crime p.62.

Jean-Pierre Charbonneau p. 41 Cotroni became a Canadian citizen in 1929. Criminal career By the age of 20, Cotroni had accumulated a lengthy record of minor offenses, bootlegging with local bootlegger Armand Courville. The charges included theft, possession of counterfeit money, illegal sale of alcohol, assault and battery.La fili√®re canadienne, p. 42 In 1928, Cotroni was charged with rape against Maria Bresciano, but the charge was dropped when Maria agreed to marry him in May 1928, and later had a child, Rosina. In 1942, Cotroni bought a bar and nightclub with Courville. Cotroni had become involved in organized crime in the late 1920s, and in the 1930s was involved in \\"baseball bat elections\\" where he served as \\"muscle\\" for the Quebec Liberal Party and the Union Nationale, beating up supporters of rival parties and stuffing ballot boxes.Auger and Edwards The Encyclopedia of Canadian Organized Crime p.63. As a result of Cotroni's work in \\"baseball bat elections\\", the Cotroni family enjoyed the protection of Quebec politicians for decades afterwards.Auger and Edwards The Encyclopedia of Canadian Organized Crime p.63. Cotroni was uncle by marriage to professional wrestler Dino Bravo, believed by authorities to be involved in his organization for some time. In 1953, Carmine \\"Lilo\\" Galante, an influential member of the New York-based Bonanno crime family, arrived in Montreal and worked with Cotroni. Galante planned to make Montreal a pivotal location in the importation of heroin from over seas for distribution in New York City and across the United States in the French Connection. Police also estimated that Galante was collecting gambling profits in Montreal worth about $50 million per year.Auger and Edwards The Encyclopedia of Canadian Organized Crime p.63. In April 1956, due to Galante's strong-arm extortion tactics, the Canadian Government deported him back to the United States. By the 1960s, Cotroni owned a limousine, a duplex in Rosemont and a brand new home in Lavaltrie. The house featured marble floors, a large conference room, a walk- in industrial sized refrigerator, a built-in movie screen, six bathrooms, and crystal chandeliers. Cotroni also donated large sums of money to Montreal churches and charities, and later fathered a second child‚Äîthis time, a son, Nicodemo, named after his father, with his French-Canadian mistress.L'attentat, p. 159 Cotroni kept a low profile, and when a 1963 Maclean's magazine referred to him as the \\"godfather\\" of Montreal in one of their articles, Cotroni, with lawyer Jean-Paul Ste. Marie, sued the magazine company for $1.25 million in damages. The judge concluded that Cotroni's reputation was \\"tainted\\" and only awarded him an insulting $2: one dollar for the English version of Maclean's and another for the French version.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, pp. 254 In the 1960s and 70s, Cotroni used associate William \\"Obie\\" Obront to supervise a bookmaking network in the Ottawa-Hull area that handled around $50,000 in bets per day, with 25 percent going to Paolo Violi.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, pp. 262 Obie also served as Cotroni chief banker and financial adviser, responsible for laundering money. For Montreal's Expo 67, Obie also helped the Cotronis land the meat and vending machine supply contract‚Äîmost of which was tainted meat.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, pp. 264 Decline In the early 1970s, Cotroni transferred the day- to-day activities of the family to his Calabrian compatriot Paolo Violi, a capodecina together with Nicolas Di Iorio, Frank Cotroni and Luigi Greco.Auger and Edwards The Encyclopedia of Canadian Organized Crime p.195.L'atentat, p. 65 Cotroni's role became more that of an adviser to the younger Calabrian.La Presse, 1er d√©cembre 1973Idem, p. 63 Greco led the Sicilian faction of the family until his death in 1972.Lamothe, Lee.

Violi complained about the independent modus operandi of his Sicilian 'underlings', Nicolo Rizzuto in particular. \\"He is going from one side to the other, here and there, and he says nothing to nobody, he is doing business and nobody knows anything,\\" Violi said about Rizzuto. Violi asked for more 'soldiers' from his Bonanno bosses, clearly preparing for war, and Violi's boss at the time, Vic Cotroni remarked: \\"Me, I'm capodecina. I got the right to expel.\\" In 1974, Cotroni was subpoenaed to stand before the Quebec government's Commission d'enqu√™te sur le crime organis√© (CECO) inquiry into organized crime. He was sent to jail for one year on a contempt charge because his testimony, the Commission concluded, was \\"deliberately incomprehensible; rambling, vague, and nebulous\\". His lawyer eventually won a reversal but only after Cotroni had spent several months behind bars. Later that year, Cotroni and Paolo Violi were over-heard on a police wiretap threatening to kill Hamilton mobster Johnny Papalia and demanding $150,000 after he used their names in a $300,000 extortion plot without notifying or cutting them in on the score. The three were convicted of extortion in 1975 and sentenced to six years in prison. Cotroni and Violi got their sentences appealed to just six months, but Papalia's was rejected.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, pp. 326 On January 22, 1978, Violi was murdered under Rizzuto orders while Rizzuto was in Venezuela.Idem, p. 69 Violi's brothers were also murdered.

Early life Coffin was born to Benjamin and Jedida (n√©e Hussey) Coffin on Nantucket, Province of Massachusetts, August 18, 1734. Of all his siblings, he was the one who became proficient in Latin and was able to have conversations in the Latin language with his father to the admiration and amazement of their friends. He worked as a carpenter in his early years. Family life On June 1, 1757, Micajah Coffin, at age 23, married Abigail Coleman, the daughter of Elihu Coleman, a distinguished Quaker preacher of his day in the Nantucket Quaker Meeting House. They had four children: Isaiah, Gilbert, Jedida, and Zenas Coffin. Their youngest son, Zenas Coffin, became one of the most successful of Nantucket's eighteenth century whaling merchants. His first cousin was Sir Admiral Isaac Coffin. Business career Coffin was one of the leading mariners and traders in the whaling industry. Coffin and two of his sons, Gilbert Coffin and Zenas Coffin, operated a Nantucket based whaling firm during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries called Micajah Coffin and Sons. Their firm conducted business dealing in whale oil, candles, potash, and supplies to Nantucket. Their firm not only conducted business in eastern United States ports, but also did so in the West Indies, France, Nova Scotia, Brazil, and England. Their firm had great success and laid the foundation for Zenas Coffin's future fortune which he later used to enrich the island. Political career In 1791, at age 57, Coffin was elected by a large vote as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives representing Nantucket. He served this office for 21 years from 1791 to 1812. For his first 15 years, he was the only representative for Nantucket County. On May 29, 1795, Coffin offered an act to the House to change their current name of the \\"Town of Sherborn\\" in Nantucket County to the \\"Town of Nantucket\\" as there was another town with the same name in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts creating confusion for people. On June 8, 1795, this bill was endorsed and signed by Governor Samuel Adams which made it officially changed and known as Nantucket in Nantucket County. Death Coffin died on May 25, 1827.

Canepa's artistic identity was shaped in New York City, where he lived from the age of 21, never returning to stay in his native country. Despite this distance, or perhaps because of it, as Le√≥n David has pointed out, his works always evince a certain dominicanidad without his setting out to achieve it as a goal ‚Äî a dominicanidad that is never folkloric.Le√≥n David, C√°nepa, 1988 ‚Äì preface Jerrilynn D.

Biography  Desnuda sobre la yerba, oil on canvas, 86.4x61 cm, 1939, Smithsonian American Art Museum Canepa was born in 1916 in San Pedro de Macor√≠s in the Dominican Republic.Danilo de los Santos, Memoria de la pintura dominicana, Vol. II. Santo Domingo: Grupo Le√≥n Jimenes, 2003, p. 337 His initial artistic studies were in his native country. After participating in the political movement against the Trujillo dictatorship his existence in the Dominican Republic became precarious, and he left for New York in 1935, settling there permanently in 1937 when he accepted a position in the New York Siqueiros workshop on 13th Street.Laurence P. Hurlburt, The Mexican Muralists in the United States, University of New Mexico Press, 1991. There he worked under Roberto Berdecio on a number of murals, while attending class at the Art Students League. Exile intensified his childhood memories, which were colored by his maternal family's progressive republican and anti- colonial traditions. Two of his maternal ancestors had been presidents of the Dominican Republic: Manuel Jimenes (presidency 1848-1849), a product of the Enlightenment and abolitionism, and Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra (presidency 1902-1916). In addition, Canepa's art reflected his paternal Genovese family's seafaring history and his father's extravagant construction of a small opera theater in San Pedro de Macor√≠s, the Teatro Col√≥n. It was there, watching the Spanish painter Enrique Tarazona at work, that Canepa gained \\"the sweeping confidence and bold absorption of historical styles that characterizes much\\" of his painting, \\"absorbing his catechism of old masters at such an early age that it became a digested part of his work.\\"Jerrilynn D. Dodds, preface to Le√≥n David, C√°nepa. Santo Domingo: Galer√≠a de Arte Moderno, 1988, p. 8. In New York he was steeped in the artistic and social ferment of the WPA period. He exhibited in the Bonestell and ACA galleries, and his early circle of friends, with whom he exchanged paintings and drawings, included the painters David Burliuk, Pavel Tchelitchew, Walter Houm√®re, Rufino Tamayo and Mario Carre√±o and (later) Edward Laning. Far from setting out to become a 'Dominican' painter, he felt himself to be part of a broader tradition. Here a key influence was his mentor, the Dominican art historian and musicologist Am√©rico Lugo Romero. With Lugo he spent almost every day of the better part of a year in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, absorbing his mentor's working connoisseurship of Renaissance art as the two discussed and challenged attributions of paintings. His earliest recognition in the Dominican Republic came from Rafael D√≠az Niese, on the occasion of a show of self-portraits in 1943 at the Galer√≠a Nacional de Bellas Artes in Santo Domingo. D√≠az Niese's essay established Canepa, Dar√≠o Suro and Jaime Colson as the trinity of Dominican artists who led the second generation of high modernism (1930s and 1940s). Of Canepa's now lost 1943 self-portrait, D√≠az Niese wrote: > An intense inner life animated this small-sized work. All its elements > indicated that its author was more than a mere painter, but rather a true > artist: The strength of the lines, the realization of the volumes in a > perfect succession of planes and the exquisite restraint with which he has > been able to shape his youthful expressiveness while using a rather cool > tonality ‚Äì all of this makes it plain that the author possesses an > exceptional artistic temperament.Rafael D√≠az-Niese, Quadernos de Cultura > Dominicana, No. 12 (1944), quoted in Danilo de los Santos, Memoria de la > pintura dominicana, Vol. II. Santo Domingo: Grupo Le√≥n Jimenes, 2003, p. > 337. Regarding other early works and against the background of Canepa's familiarity with Renaissance art, D√≠az Niese summed up the outstanding qualities of his paintings: In his early works, according to Edward Sullivan, \\"the figures are solidly constructed in an almost sculptural fashion. They exist in a seemingly timeless realm\\"; in works of the 1970s he seems to be paying homage to Mantegna, Piero and other Quattrocento artists who \\"demonstrated such interest in the cool, calm and quasi-mathematical measuring of space. Many of these compositions are highly expansive and suggest the ambitious spatial descriptions of mural paintings.\\"Edward J. Sullivan, Tito Canepa: An Exhibition of Early and Recent Paintings, September 3-September 30, 1992, Step Gallery, New York. New York: Step Gallery, 1992. The Dream, acrylic on gesso panel, 91.4x121.9 cm, 1975, private collection. Dream symbolism, the \\"nostalgic search for a vanished land\\" and the exploration of the \\"mysterious realm of family and childhood\\" are among the themes that Le√≥n David identified in Canepa's work.Le√≥n David, C√°nepa, 1988 ‚Äì preface by Jerrilynn D. Dodds. Santo Domingo: Galer√≠a de Arte Moderno, 1988, p. 62. During the Second World War Canepa served in the US Army's Signal Corps making propaganda films. In 1944 he married the modern dancer Florence Lessing.\\"Florence Lessing, 86, a Dancer in Theater, Nightclubs and Films,\\" New York Times, September 9, 2002 https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/22/nyregion/florence-lessing-86-a-dancer-in- theater-nightclubs-and-films.html In the 1950s, from New York, he was centrally involved in the group of political leaders planning to bring down the dictator of the Dominican Republic Trujillo.Francisco Rodr√≠guez de Le√≥n, El Furioso Merengue del Norte. Una Historia de la Comunidad Dominicana en los Estados Unidos, New York: Editorial Sitel, 1998, pp. 133-134. In the 1970s his work was the object of a series of articles in Dominican newspapers, notably those by Mar√≠a Ugarte, a leading expert on the country's cultural and artistic heritage, in El Caribe, and by poet and art critic Le√≥n David, in El S√≠glo. This renewed interest was largely triggered by one event: the efforts of a member of the Trujillo family to seize his historical triptych Enriquillo ‚Äì Duarte ‚Äì Luper√≥n (1971) while still in the Santo Domingo airport.The triptych was brought to Santo Domingo to be exhibited. Confidential information indicated that a member of the Trujillo family was about to have it seized at the airport for his own use while it was in the Dominican customs area. Canepa was urgently advised to move the triptych back to the airline's hangar and have it returned to the US. It thus never left the airport (information from a conversation with Tito Canepa). The new appreciation culminated in the publication in 1988 of Le√≥n David's monograph.Le√≥n David, C√°nepa, 1988 ‚Äì preface Jerrilynn D. Dodds. Santo Domingo: Galer√≠a de Arte Moderno, 1988.

In the 1980s Canepa together with several other Dominican artists, including Bismarck Victoria, Freddy Rodr√≠guez and Magno Laracuente formed the Dominican Visual Artists of New York (DVANY), which organized several important exhibitions. In 1992 he was the recipient of a lifetime achievement award from the Fundaci√≥n Ciencia y Arte of the Dominican Republic, with \\"the eternal gratitude of the Dominican people for [his] pictorial oeuvre.\\" In the 1990s, Canepa exhibited his work in a number of shows, including a show of Latin American art at the Mexican Cultural Institute in Washington DC and the Step Gallery in New York.Edward J. Sullivan, Tito Canepa: An Exhibition of Early and Recent Paintings, September 3-September 30, 1992, Step Gallery, New York.

Life  Nanogak was born on Baillie Island, Northwest Territories, in 1925. Her father, Natkutsiak (Billy Banksland) was from Nome, Alaska, and worked as a harpoonist on whaling boats. He sailed with explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson in his attempt to find the Northwest Passage. Natkutsiak was a skilled story teller, and instilled in Nanogak an appreciation for legends and the tradition of story telling. Nanogak's mother, Topsy Ekiona, came from the Mackenzie Delta region, near Tuktoyaktuk. Ekiona and Natkutsiak married and travelled between Baillie Island and Banks Island, where a trading post afforded them trapping and trading opportunities. Nanogak and her brother, Alec Aliknak Banksland, were born on Baille Island. The family relocated to Sachs Harbour on Banks Island before settling at Holman, on Victoria Island, in 1934, when Nanogak was nine years old. At the time, they were the only family to reside in Holman. In 1943 Nanogak married Wallace Goose from the Tuktoyaktuk, and Kugluktuk (Coppermine) areas. They had seven children. In 1985 Nanogak received an honorary degree from Mount Saint Vincent University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Nanogak is the first Inuit artist to receive an honorary degree from a university. Section15.ca, Nancy's Very Own Foundation Nanogak was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2000. After the diagnosis, she describes feeling increased urgency to continue her work, so that she could \\"help people remember the stories.\\" Nanogak died in Holman in 2001, and in 2002 the Winnipeg Art Gallery held a solo exhibition of her works. Her work has been featured in dozens of exhibitions across Canada, the United States, and Europe. Her artwork can be found in the collections of at least fifteen institutions across Canada and the United States.  Career  Nanogak's father encouraged her to draw from an early age, and she was a part of the first generation of artists to provide drawings for Holman's printmaking program, which starting in the 1960s. Her earliest drawings were completed using graphite pencils, however she opted to use colourful felt-tip pens when they became available to her in 1970. Her artwork is described as fluid, bold in colour, and having \\"nervous energy\\". Her early works centred on themes of childhood, drum songs, and Inuit life. Many of these drawings were later translated into prints, and by the end of her career she had contributed approximately one hundred forty images to a total of twenty annual print collections. Nanogak contributed to every print collection by the Holman artists' co-operative since 1967. Nanogak is famous for her contributions as the illustrator of the children's books Tales from the Igloo (1972), and More Tales from the Igloo (1986), which feature Inuit legends translated into English by Father Maurice Metayer. Her stories and drawings reflect her father's Alaskan roots and the Mackenzie Delta/Copper Inuit culture of her mother and husband. Both her son and grandson, Billy and Rex Goose, are considered talented graphic artists.  List of works  *Metayer, Maurice & Nanogak, Agnes (ill.). Tales From the Igloo.

Greek expatriates form most of the leadership of the Eastern Greek Orthodox Church in the country. History=Classic period In the late 330s BCE, Alexander the Great invaded the Middle East (including the area which is now Israel and Palestine), during his campaigns against the Achaemenid Empire. The landscape during this period was markedly changed by extensive growth and development that included urban planning and the establishment of well-built fortified cities. Hellenistic pottery, trade and commerce flourished, particularly in the most Hellenized areas, such as Ashkelon, Jaffa, Jerusalem, Gaza, and ancient Nablus (Tell Balatah). When the Hasmonean Kingdom was absorbed into the Roman Empire, the area remained under the influence of the Greek language and culture. Especially when the Byzantine Empire took the position of the Romans, Palaestina reached its greatest prosperity in antiquity. Urbanization increased, large new areas were put under cultivation, monasteries proliferated and synagogues were restored. The cities of Palaestina Prima and Teria, such as Caesarea Maritima, Jerusalem, Scythopolis, Neapolis, and Gaza reached their peak population, and the population west of the Jordan may have reached as many as one million. Middle Ages Since the 7th century, when the Arabs conquered the region, the Greek presence was reduced. Today there is a small Greek community in Israel. Also there are Greeks in charge of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem. There is also a large number of Romaniote and Sephardic Greek Jews who emigrated from Greece and live now in Israel, some of whom made aliyah over the previous centuries, with most moving to Israel after Israeli independence.

The three championships in one season gave Carr a Triple Crown, the first ever achieved in rodeo. As of 2015, he is one of 10 cowboys to accomplish the feat. Carr's second All-Around Cowboy title came in 1933; two years later, he was gored by a bull at a rodeo in Visalia, suffering a perforation of his abdomen. Carr finished second in the 1936 Chicago rodeo's combined bronc riding and calf roping standings, behind Lonnie Rooney. In 1940, he added a second steer roping championship. Carr was also a three-time champion of the California Rodeo, and appeared as a film actor in Westerns. After various mergers, the RAA was absorbed into the Rodeo Cowboys Association (RCA), which later became known as the modern PRCA. That association uses RAA standings from the pre-RCA era in its yearly rankings. Therefore, Carr is recognized by the PRCA as a world champion for the five season titles he won from 1930 to 1940. Sports Illustrated's Susan Davis called Carr \\"the Babe Ruth of rodeo riders\\". Author Clifford P. Westermeier described him as \\"one of the great cowboys of the age\\", and said of his personality that he was \\"a strange man, difficult to meet and extremely hard to get acquainted with.\\" Regardless, Carr was a respected figure in the rodeo world; Westermeier wrote that he was \\"regarded as a very tough customer in a business deal, fight, or a poker game.\\" Carr was considered strongest in rodeos held in the western U.S., and rarely competed on the East Coast,Westermeier, pp. 224‚Äì225. although he did participate in some rodeos overseas. The Rodeo Hall of Fame of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum inducted Carr in 1955. He was also inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 1979, and the California Rodeo Salinas Hall of Fame in 2016.

Designed by local architects Erik Flagstad Rasmussen and Knud Thomsen, the yellow-brick building with large triangular stained-glass windows was completed in 1961.  Background  Esbjerg is a city with several new churches, most of which were established after the Second World War when there was a marked increase in the population. Designed to accommodate a large congregation while offering additional facilities for both young and old, Trinity Church was the first of many. Breaking with tradition, its square- shaped nave was built directly adjacent to lower ancillary buildings including a hall with a stage, meeting rooms and a kitchen. The bell tower stands alone, quite separate from the church.  Architecture  In the late 1950s, Erik Flagstad Rasmussen and Knud Thomsen won the competition which had been specifically directed to attract responses from the city's architects. The church itself is a square-shaped building of yellow brick crowned with a low octagonal spire. There are four triangular gables of glass and concrete, all with pointed tops. Completed in 1967, the stained-glass gable windows were designed by Jens Urup Jensen with themes representing Christmas (north) with a red Star of Bethlehem, Easter (east, above the altar) with a cross, Whitsun (south) with 12 red tongues symbolising the Apostles and a blue-toned Water of Life frame (west) above the organ gallery. The colouring of the north and south windows is rather cool while the designs to the east and west are much warmer. In 1993, an apse was added. In 1999, the church was seriously damaged by a hurricane which dislodged sections of the copper roof. They were used to make a cross, designed by Erik Heide which stands outside next to the south wall.  Interior  The walls inside are of plain brick, the flooring of √òland tiles. A simple oak cross hangs above the altar. The font is also of oak while the pulpit is built of concrete with Christ's monogram. Male choir Treenighedskirkens Drengekor (Trinity Church's Boys Choir) was founded by organist Per G√ºnther in 1964 who led the choir until he retired 1989. Thereafter, it has been supported by Esbjerg Municipality and the Esbjerg's Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts in collaboration with the church. Today it consists of 50 singers, boys starting at the age of 8 or 9. They give performances of classical church music both at home and abroad. Venues have included St Peters, Rome, Notre Dame de Paris and Westminster Abbey. Their concerts have also been widely broadcast on radio and television, not only in Denmark but in Europe and North America. The choir has also made numerous recordings.

She grew up in Ypres, Belgium. Her talent was discovered by Th√©odore Ceriez (1831‚Äì1904), a painter who had married her sister H√©l√®ne. Since women were not yet admitted to the academies he educated her and already in 1885 her painting \\"De Oesters\\" (The Oysters) was exhibited at a salon in Spa. Jules Breton saw her work and encouraged her to go to Paris for further education.Benezit Dictionary of Artists  Life and career  From 1887 to 1891 de Hem mostly lived in Paris, where Alfred Stevens was one of her teachers. At the private Acad√©mie Julian she painted living and sometimes nude models (which was at that time in Belgium still forbidden for women). In 1891, she returned to Ypres where she shared a studio with Ceriez at the G. de Stuersstraat 33. She soon received commissions for portraits and also created still lives. In Paris, she frequently exhibited at the Salon de la Societ√© des Artistes Fran√ßais. de Hem exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts and The Woman's Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. In 1900, she was the only Belgian painter to exhibit at the Women's Exhibition in London and in 1902 she became a member of the Women's International Art Club. In 1904, she won a gold medal in Paris for her painting \\"De Japanse Pop\\" (The Japanese Doll). After Ceriez died on 2 Sep 1904 de Hem moved to Vorst (near Brussels) with her mother and her sister, where they lived in an Art Nouveau house designed by Ernest Blerot. On 2 May 1908, she married Fr√©d√©ric Lebbe, an engineer who was seven years her senior and in 1911 she received a knighthood.

A son of Zadok Casey, Casey attended Ohio University and practiced medicine in Benton and Mount Vernon, Illinois. In 1858, he moved to the newly established Mound City, Illinois, where he became their longtime mayor. A supporter of Stephen A. Douglas, Casey was elected to three terms in the Illinois House of Representatives. Biography Newton R. Casey was born in Jefferson County, Illinois on January 27, 1826. He was the son of Zadok Casey, the fourth Lieutenant Governor of Illinois (1830‚Äì1833) and a five-term U.S. Representative. His brothers were Samuel K., Thomas S., and John R. Casey. Casey attended public schools until 1838, when his father sent him to Hillsboro Academy. Two years later he studied at Mount Vernon Academy, and then was accepted to Ohio University in 1842. Casey graduated three years later and returned to Mount Vernon, Illinois to study medicine under Dr. John W. Corwin. In 1847, Casey moved to Benton, Illinois and founded a medical practice with a Dr. Towns. Casey practiced in Benton for a year before again returning to Mount Vernon. He attended courses at the Missouri Medical College in 1856‚Äì1857, receiving a medical degree. He then moved to Mound City, Illinois, a city founded by his father-in-law three years earlier. Casey was elected to the city council the next year and was elected mayor in 1859. He held the office of mayor until 1874. Casey was a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention, supporting eventual candidate Stephen A. Douglas. When the Mound City Civil War Naval Hospital was founded in 1861, Casey volunteered his services. He eventually was named assistant surgeon, and held that position for most of his life. In 1866, Casey was nominated by the Democratic Party for a seat on the Illinois House of Representatives. He was re-elected two years later. In both terms, Casey was the Democratic nominee for Speaker of the House, but the Republican Party held the majority in both sessions and Casey was defeated. Although defeated in a re-election bid following the 1870 state redistricting, he was re-elected in 1872. He was again nominated and defeated in a bid for Speaker. During this term, he successfully rallied support to build a monument at Mound City National Cemetery. Casey largely retired from politics in 1874 to focus on his medical practice, though he was elected to one more term as Mound City mayor in the 1880s. Casey married Flora Rawlings on December 4, 1847. They had three children: Ida M., Frank R., and Maude H. Casey died in Mound city, Illinois after a brief illness.Newton R.

He was born and raised in Michigan, and his studio is in Stratford, Ontario. He designs posters for theaters and other performing arts companies across North America, and he creates illustration for books and magazines. He is known for his drawings on scratchboard, a process in which he uses a knife blade to carve white lines onto a black board. It is somewhat similar to engraving or woodcutting, in the sense that images are formed by carving white lines. In the last stages, color is often added to the illustrations. Posters He has designed theatre posters for the Shaw Festival in Niagara- on-the-Lake, New York‚Äôs Roundabout Theatre, Pearl Theatre (New York City), Great Lakes Theater, Denver Center Theatre Company, The Acting Company, Arena Stage, Seattle Repertory Theatre, The Goodman Theatre in Chicago, Center Theatre Group in Los Angeles, and regional theaters in major cities in the United States and Canada. He has done extensive work for The National Ballet of Canada, National Arts Centre, The Canadian Stage Company, and Theatre Calgary. Describing his technique for creating theatre posters he has said, ‚ÄúI think of the play as a road map for any graphic design assignment. The first page of a script usually indicates the time and place in which the story occurs. I read the text to get the story in my head, but at the same time I‚Äôm watching for clues from the playwright about the world of the play.‚Äù Book illustration He has created illustrations for a variety of projects including book covers. He has illustrated the covers of over thirty books, including The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Alice in Wonderland, Oliver Twist, Peter Pan, Around the World in Eighty Days, Anne of Avonlea, as well as Neil Gaiman‚Äôs comic book series Marvel 1602.McKowen, Scott. A Fine Line: Scratchboard Illustrations. Firefly Books. September 2009. A recent project is to illustrate a series of children‚Äôs classics for Sterling Publishing. Biography McKowen was born in 1957 in Lansing, Michigan. He attended Elmhurst Elementary School in Lansing, then Dwight Rich Junior High School and then Sexton High School. His father taught at Sexton, and directed musicals. McKowen says, ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs where I got the theater bug‚Äù. McKowen's first graphics assignment for which he was paid was the creation of a theatre poster for a high school production of the musical comedy Once upon a Mattress. His mother was a professional sign painter, and he credits her for giving him an appreciation for typography and how it can be used. As a freshman in college, he and another art student, Sam Viviano, turned out silk screened posters for the theater department. Viviano went on to work as the art director at Mad Magazine in New York City. McKowen graduated from the University of Michigan School of Art in Ann Arbor, with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, magna cum laude. After college, and while living in Ann Arbor, Michigan, he would travel 200 miles north to see theatre in Stratford, Ontario. One year he brought his portfolio along and was offered a job designing theatre posters. This was his break into the world of professional graphic illustration. McKowen is known to create images that ‚Äúcapture the essence‚Äù of plays by authors that include Shakespeare, Shaw, Chekhov, and Moli√®re. He has described that while working with pen and ink in the 1980s, he began to feel frustrated that his lines were too delicate for the graphic strength that he wanted, and so he took up scratchboard. Noted illustrator, Milton Glaser, has said that ‚ÄúScott McKowen is one of the great illustrators of our time‚Äù In 2002, McKowen curated Worth a Thousand Words, an exhibition of international theatre posters at Gallery Stratford, the Design Exchange in downtown Toronto, and at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa. He was commissioned by the Royal Canadian Mint to design Canada‚Äôs 2001 silver dollar, commemorating The National Ballet of Canada‚Äôs fiftieth Anniversary. McKowen's wife, Christina Poddubiuk, is a theatre set and costume designer and has an honors English degree. Together they have a design studio, Punch & Judy.

In 1937 it came second in the first World Gliding Championships, having previously made a flight of . Design and development Wolf Hirth was one of the first pilots to understand the glider characteristics necessary for cross-country flying on days with separated, strong thermals. It had to be equipped with a ballast tank to fly fast between thermals and be stable and efficient in the continuous, lift-gaining circling within the thermals, calling for high-aspect ratio wings with dihedral. He commissioned Edmund Schneider to build a one-off example, to be designed by Friedrich Wenk. The result was the Moazagotl. Moazagotl was the nickname of Motz Gottlieb, formed from a corruption of his name, who was a farmer in the Silesian countryside near the Schneider works. He had noticed that with the wind in a particular direction, cloud formed over a nearby valley remained stationary even though the wind was strong. The phenomenon was communicated to meteorologists at an observatory near Breslau and their director passed on the observations to the glider pilots at Grunau, who thus became the first to exploit wave lift. The Moazagottl was a high gull wing glider. The inner third of the span carried a dihedral of about 8¬∞ and was rectangular in plan. Single, broad-chord faired lift struts on each side braced these sections from about 20% of the span to the lower fuselage. Outboard the wing had no dihedral and was strongly swept on the leading edge, resulting in marked taper. Long ailerons occupied the whole trailing edge of each outer panels; these were slightly tapered and projected behind the trailing edge of the inner sections. The wing was built around a single, swept main spar which was straight in plan, simplifying its change in direction between the inner and outer panels. Diagonal sub-spars ran inwards and rearwards from it between the lift strut attachment points and the fuselage. Plywood skinning forward of these spars around the leading edge formed a D-box; aft, the wing, including the aileron, was fabric covered. Its fuselage was ply covered and roughly oval in cross section, with a somewhat pointed nose and tapering gently and uniformly from wing to tail. The cockpit, just ahead of the leading edge, was enclosed by a plywood cover in Musterle fashion, providing illumination and limited views through small windows and portholes. Instrumentation was generous, including a variometer though lacking an artificial horizon for cloud flying. of water ballast was contained in a tank behind the pilot's seat. At the rear a tapered all moving tailplane was mounted just above the fuselage and far enough forward to need only a small cut out for rudder movement. All tail surfaces were largely fabric covered, with ply leading edges. There was no fin but the balanced rudder was much increased in chord and area after early flight tests demonstrated the power of the ailerons. The Moazagotl landed on a slender skid that reached from nose to mid chord, assisted by a faired tail skid. Operational history The Moagazotl competed in the 1933 Rh√∂n (Wasserkuppe) competition, where Hirth made the longest flight, a distance of . The following year he flew it , only the second plot to achieve this distance. In the 1937 competition, retrospectively recognised as the first of the World Gliding Championships, Ludwig Hofmann flew the four years old Moazagotl into second place. It also made a visit to Brazil. The sole example was preserved in the Hornberg Museum until the end of World War II, when it was deliberately burned to prevent it falling into allied hands.

It was released on April 26, 1994, via Nuyo and Imago Records. The album sold more than 30,000 copies, which was considered as \\"a modest showing by the recording industry but a clear bestseller by poetry standards.\\" The video for the track \\"Hey Baby\\" gained rotation on MTV and was featured on an episode of Beavis and Butt-head. Critical reception The album received generally positive reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated: \\"...the musical numbers are a little awkward, but Estep's words are vicious, cutting, smart, provocative and funny.\\" He also further added: \\"The music may have dated and so has some of the pop culture references, but Estep's words retain their power on No More Mister Nice Girl.\\" Stereo Review wrote: \\"Estep is really more out of the beatnik performance tradition, and so the music on No More Mister Nice Girl is essentially functional, a post-modern rock equivalent of bongo drums at a poetry reading.\\" In The Trouser Press guide to '90s rock, Ira Robbins wrote: \\"Even though her solo performances seethe with a star quality combination of charisma and content that should make such crutches superfluous, Estep's album, No More Mr. Nice Girl, finds her so bent on coloring within the lines of rock song structure that she sacrifices her usual slashing intensity for mere melodicism.\\" Legacy In The A.V. Club's obituary of Estep, Sean O'Neal wrote: \\"Like other spoken-word artists of the grunge era such as King Missile (and even Henry Rollins, if you like), Maggie Estep married her aggressive, sardonic verse to rock music, on albums such as 1994‚Äôs No More Mister Nice Girl.

Career Herbert was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, and joined the Diplomatic Service in 1879. In the early years of his service, he was posted at Petrograd, Washington, D.C., Buenos Aires, Tehran, Brussels, Bern, Stockholm and Copenhagen. In August 1902, he was appointed Consul-General at Budapest, and the following year he became charg√© d'affaires at Darmstadt (Hesse) and Karlsruhe (Baden). He received official allowances for knowledge of Russian and Persian and spoke five other languages fluently.The Times, 1 September 1921, page 13 After the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905, Herbert was appointed the first British envoy to the newly independent Norway, with the then-customary title of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. He was the first foreign envoy to arrive in Christiania (now Oslo) after the recognition of Norway as an independent state by foreign powers. The Villa Frogn√¶s in 1935 Shortly afterwards he bought the Villa Frogn√¶s, built in 1859 for the banker Thomas Heftye and recognized as one of the finest private residences in the city, to be the British Legation. The Foreign Office had strongly recommended a rental property, but Herbert argued that with the new Norwegian king, Haakon VII, married to a British princess, it was imperative for Britain to establish a first-class legation there, and the British Treasury approved the purchase early in 1906.Mark Bertram, Room for Diplomacy: Britain's Diplomatic Buildings Overseas 1800-2000, Spire Books, 2011 The Villa Frogn√¶s remains the official residence of the British Ambassador, but new offices have been built behind the house, facing Thomas Heftyes gate, to house the embassy. Herbert was appointed envoy to Mexico in 1911 but did not proceed and instead retired from the diplomatic service. Personal life Harriet Ives Gammell, age 6, Helen Louise Gammell, age 3 Sir Arthur James Herbert married Harriet Ives Gammell, from Providence, the daughter of William Gammell, a professor at Brown University. She was a direct descendant of the Ives family of Providence and also of Nicholas Brown, since Nicholas Brown's daughter married Thomas Ives in the 18th century. Honours Herbert was appointed CVO in 1905, knighted KCVO on his appointment to Norway and raised to GCVO in 1908 on the occasion of a state visit by King Edward VII to Norway.

DataRank was founded in 2011 and graduated from the Y Combinator seed accelerator in 2013. Background University of Arkansas graduates Ryan Frazier, Chuong Nguyen, Britt Cagnina, and Kenny Cason launched DataRank, originally known as TTAGG, in October 2011 out of a rental house near the university's campus. After rebranding itself as DataRank in 2013, the company launched its consumer insights blog. In 2013 the company was admitted into Y Combinator. In 2014 DataRank raised $1.4 million in seed funding from New Road Ventures, FundersClub, and individual business angels. Enterprise customers Notable companies that use DataRank's Consumer Insights Dashboard include Clorox, and ConAgra Foods. How it works DataRank's analytics dashboard allows brand managers to monitor and analyze conversations from a wide variety of sources such as social media, blogs, discussion forums, and e-commerce stores. Additional data sources and internal information can be uploaded directly to DataRank. Upon registration, the service compiles one year of company data and establishes the company's areas of focus. These might include competitive subject matter as well as the product categories or particular brands to be monitored. The areas of interest are ranked according to several insights including commenter and comment influence, demographic metadata, relevancy, machine-learned patterns, and recency. DataRank then pulls in conversations and comments from across the web, using a proprietary algorithm to sort results according to relevance. Users can navigate the dashboard by scrolling through sorted data or drilling down to view the volume of conversation, demographics, or total reach, with the option to delve into more detailed metrics about the customers who use the products or interact with the brands. The service also allows companies to compare their performance and various product features against those of competitors. DataRank is different from similar social listening and social analytics services in the way that it organizes the unstructured data and conversations that it brings in. The resulting analytics enable companies to make decisions based on highly relevant information. Visualizations In addition to DataRank's content stream and search options, the dashboard also includes an annotated volume graph of comments, a sentiment graph, and a map of sentiment by state.

Before County Wicklow was shired in 1606, Rathdown extended further south: it was named after a medieval settlement which grew up around Rathdown Castle, at a site subsequently deserted and now in County Wicklow in the townland of Rathdown Upper, north of Greystones. The Wicklow barony of Rathdown corresponds to the portion transferred to the new county; although both divisions were originally classed as \\"half baronies\\", in the nineteenth century the distinction between a barony and a half barony was obsolete.
