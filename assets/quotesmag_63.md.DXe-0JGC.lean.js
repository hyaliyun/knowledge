His father, Jean Ernest Mercier, was an historian and the mayor of Constantine, Algeria, Algeria (then a French colony), where Ernest was born.  Early life and the First World War  Mercier's grandfather Stanislas Mercier, a Protestant republican from Doubs, left metropolitan France and established himself in Algeria, then a French colony. His father, Jean Ernest Mercier, had served as military-interpreter of Arabic to the colonial army and was a prolific author. Ernest Mercier Jr., was the third son of five children. After studying at the √âcole Polytechnique, he chose a career in the French Navy. He was posted to the port in Toulon, where he was responsible for modernizing the site, notably the electrical network. He completed his education at the √âcole Sup√©rieure d‚ÄôElectricit√© between 1905 and 1908, during which time he married Madeleine Tassin (1881-1924), the daughter of a republican Senator. He was later noticed by Albert Petsche, and left the public sector for private electrical enterprise. During the First World War, conscripted into the navy, he fought in the Balkans and the Dardanelles. According to Kuisel (1967, p. 5), he had a \\"fighting spirit\\". Injured while in command of Romanian troops on the Danube, he returned to Paris, where he served as the liaison of Louis Loucheur (Minister of Munitions for Georges Clemenceau) to Generals Ferdinand Foch and Philippe P√©tain, as well as to the American troops. After the war, he remained as Colonel Mercier for the Anglo- American forces. When Louis Loucheur was named Minister for the Liberated Zones, Mercier accompanied him and dealt with the German factories that were dependent on the Military Control Board.  Career in the electrical and petroleum industries  Ernest Mercier was most active in two sectors, electricity and petroleum which were at the time among the newest, and would soon boost the French economy of the 1920s. In 1919, he played a key role in founding the Electrical Union which encompassed various small companies around Paris.Ernest Mercier et la CFP, Tristan Gaston-Breton, Les √âchos, July 27, 2006 In the inter-war period, he was an important player in the electrical power industry of France, via the Messine Group, constructing thermal and hydroelectric power plants. In 1923, he was appointed by Raymond Poincar√©--on the suggestion of Louis Pineau, his advisor for the petroleum business, and by Louis Loucheur, then Minister for Industrial Reconstruction--to rebuild and restructure the petroleum sector by creating a sufficiently large company to be the premiere supplier for the nation. In effect, war and development of mechanical transport had showed both the strategic importance of this sector and France's weakness in the area. The French Petroleum Company (CFP) was founded in March 1924. A 1931 law gave 35% of its capital to the state (it was until then entirely private), although Mercier successfully averted a total takeover by the government. From its first holding, a 25% stake in the Turkish Petroleum Company, the CFP grew thanks to oil extraction near Kirkuk, Iraq, then in Colombia and in Venezuela. CFP also had interests in Romania (Steaua Roumania). Mercier extended the vertical integration of the company by constructing petroleum transport infrastructure and refineries at Gonfreville, near Le Havre and on the √âtang de Berre, near Martigues.Ernest Mercier et la CFP, Tristan Gaston-Breton, Les √âchos, July 27, 2006 From 1933 to 1940, he was the President of Alsthom.  Activism and political engagement  Mercier was one of many wealthy industrialists, during the latter part of the French Third Republic (1870-1940), who viewed the parliamentary model of democratic government as a hindrance to the growth of industry, and began to turn his thinking \\"to the Fascist \\"experiment\\" in Italy and to the growing success of the Nazi Party in Germany\\" (Shirer, William L., The Collapse of the Third Republic, 1969, p. 157). In December 1925, Mercier founded the Redressement Fran√ßais (literally the \\"French Resurgence\\"), a movement under the patronage of Marshal Ferdinand Foch with the goal of \\"gathering the elite and raising up the masses\\" (Kuisel 1967, p. 49). This movement had two main objectives: the adoption by France of a \\"Henry Ford\\" economic model (high productivity, high salaries, and mass consumption) and the modernization of political life and institutions. Despite his ambitious economic and political ideas, he failed to convince other business leaders (too Malthusian) or politicians to join him. His technocratic, elitist vision--a product of his education at the Polytechnique and influenced by Marshal Lyautey--had some aspects that could then and still can elicit hesitation even though it has now become dominant. The lack of success of his business, his involvement in the events of February 6, 1934, which he described as the victory of the \\"fighting spirit\\",on this point see Kuisel, 1967, pp.102-111 and the fall of the national union government of Gaston Doumergue (November 1934) all certainly drove Mercier to dissolve the Redressement Fran√ßais in 1935. He then ceased to be the spokesmanFor the differences of opinion between Mercier, Marlio and Detoeuf, see Morsel (1997, p.107) of the Polytechnique modernisers, and that role was passed on to Louis Marlio and to Auguste Det≈ìuf, author of the magazine Nouveaux Cahiers. Mercier continued to be active in the domain of foreign policy. Upon the death of Louis Loucheur, in 1931, he took the reins of the French Pan-European Committee. In 1932, a committee of experts fathered under the auspices of the RF urged an alliance with England to put pressure on Germany. In 1934, he urged closer ties with the USRR in order to isolate Germany. It was through this prism, it seems, that he spoke at a lecture on Russia in 1936 at the Ecole Polytechnique's Center of Economic Studies, in which he pursued the work of the Groupe X-Crise. Although he still participated the 1938 Colloque Walter Lippmann (a gathering of liberal economists), he did not seem to take any active role, and perhaps had been attracted there because the problems of liberal economics were studied from a wider perspective than just that of France.  The Second World War and beyond  In May 1940, the American ambassadorWilliam Bullitt (1891-1967) who, before being stationed in Paris (1936-1940), had been the first US ambassador to the Soviet Union(1933-1936) to Paris asked Mercier to organise the distribution of aid sent by the American Red Cross. Although the Vichy regime include many former members of the RF, such as Rapha√´l Alibert (justice minister) or Hubert Lagardelle, Ernest Mercier did not collaborate. He believed that it was partly in revenge for this that Yves Bouthillier (a former RF member who had become the Vichy finance minister) had created legislation limiting the number of administrative posts that one person could occupy (Kuisel, 1967, p. 148), which forced Mercier to leave the CFP. Having remarried in 1927 (to Marguerite Dreyfus, niece of Alfred Dreyfus), Mercier was also the object of anti-Semitic attacks. He escaped deportation only because he was hospitalised for blood poisoning on the day he was to be arrested. He then took part in the same Resistance network as Auguste Perret, the architect, and Andr√© Siegfried. In November 1944, he participated in the Rye Conference of international business, which undertook \\"a preliminary study of the economic bases for peace.\\" In 1946, when the electrical companies that Mercier had directed were nationalised to form √âlectricit√© de France, his career as a business leader ended. He continued to preside over the French branch of the International Chamber of Commerce and sat on the boards of several companies, while as an engineer he pursued research on electric turbines.

It contains the ruins of , also called Maizuru Castle, which is about 400 years old and has been designated as a Yamanashi Historical Site. Maizuru Castle Park is a place of rest and relaxation for the people of Yamanashi Prefecture. History After the Takeda family succumbed, Kai Province became the fiefdom of Oda Nobunaga. When Oda died it came under the governance of Tokugawa Ieyasu. When Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified the country, he ordered the castle's construction. It was begun in 1583 and later completed by Toyotomi's brother-in-law, Asano Nagamasa, and his son. After the Battle of Sekigahara, K≈çfu Castle fell into the hands of the Tokugawa family to whom it belonged until the end of the Tokugawa shogunate. In the early Edo period, Tokugawa Tsunatoyo became the heir of the fifth Sh≈çgun and moved to Edo Castle.Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu then became the Lord of K≈çfu Castle. Under his command the castle was fully repaired and the town was developed. However, Yanagisawa was transferred and became the Lord of Yamato K≈çriyama Castle. In the Ky≈çh≈ç period which followed, Kai Province within which K≈çfu Castle was situated came under the control of a retainer stationed in K≈çfu. During this period, the honmaru of the palace and the Akagenenmon gate were destroyed by a large fire in 1727. Later in the Meiji period the castle was abandoned; around 1877, major buildings were destroyed. Thereafter the castle area was used as an industrial testing facility. In 1897 it was decided the Yakatakuruwa and Shimizukuruwa Enclosures should be dismantled to make way for K≈çfu Station. In 1904 the area around the honmaru was opened to the public as Maizuru Castle Park. In 1930 the Government Offices and Assembly Hall moved to the dismantled lot of the Gakuyakuruwa Enclosure. The western and southern moats were completely buried; the appearance of the castle ruins became almost the same as they are seen today. There is a fair amount of reconstruction of the important castle features on site by the city of Kofu. An authentic replica of Inari Yagura tower was completed in 2004, which functions as a museum that features many artifacts from the castle's original buildings. Other reconstructions include the Inari Yagura and Yamanote Gomon gate, and reconstructed towers and a park.

The film premiered on The Family Channel (now Freeform) on February 11, 1996, as the cable channel's first original movie (and appeared on the channel until 2004, under its successor brands Fox Family and ABC Family). Filmed in Kleinburg, Ontario, Canada, it is based loosely on the 1984 young-adult novel of the same title by Ivy Ruckman, itself a semi- fictionalized account of an outbreak of seven tornadoes that struck Grand Island, Nebraska on June 3, 1980, which killed five people and injured 134 others; the film adaptation, however, is set in the fictional Nebraska town of Blainsworth, which serves as a stand-in for Grand Island. The film centers on a family's struggle to survive a night as a bizarre tornado-producing supercell thunderstorm tracks into and becomes stationary over their town. Plot The film's prologue takes place at 1:16 p.m. in an area of rural farmland in Dannebrog, Nebraska on an unspecified date in the Fall of 1996. Bob Iverson, a storm chaser with the Kansas State Tornado Center relaying information to the National Weather Service on a chase assignment, is driving down a country road to track a bizarre supercell thunderstorm. While observing the storm, Bob spots a tornado touching down almost a mile south of his location; he warns a family living nearby, right as the family's daughter Sarah, arrives home from school, about the oncoming twister, which sends them running into their root cellar just before it destroys their farm. Meanwhile, in Blainsworth, Nebraska (120 miles southwest of Dannebrog), aspiring teenage artist Dan Hatch, who is constantly being pushed by his stepfather, Jack, to be an athlete, participates in a bicycle race and damages his bike; Jack pushes Danny into finishing the race on his bum bike, where he falls behind the other racers. Much to his luck, he wins a new bike in a raffle held by a local bank. While trying out his new bike, Dan and his best friend Arthur Darlington run into Arthur's two sisters, Stacey (whom Dan is infatuated with) and Ronnie Vae, while at the park. Dan and Arthur arrive home as the former's mother Laura is preparing dinner, when she also asks Dan to tend to his baby half-brother, Ryan. Later, Laura's sister, Dan's aunt Jenny, calls to inform her that they have been assigned to fill-in shifts as waitresses at the Salty Dawg, the local diner where they both work. Because Jack will not have enough time to take Laura to work, Jenny volunteers to take her. At 3:37 p.m., while continuing to track the severe weather creeping toward the town, Bob decides to head southwest into Blainsworth, as Stan, the meteorologist Bob is radioing to, is astonished at the rogue anticyclonic spring-like weather pattern for the fall; while there, Bob meets Laura while getting some coffee at the diner. That evening, when Jack arrives home and sits down to watch TV, the show he is watching is interrupted by a KHAS-12 weather update, reporting a tornado 14 miles northwest of Blainsworth, and a tornado warning has been issued for St. Paul, Dannebrog and rural Howard County, Nebraska. Soon after Jack leaves to check on his mother, Dan's grandmother Belle, who was asleep in her rocking chair when he phoned her, tornado sirens suddenly blare throughout town, only to cut off abruptly as Dan goes to get Ryan from his crib. The eerie stillness outside afterward suddenly gives way to a violent tornado that approaches Blainsworth's Capital Heights neighborhood, with the sucking noises emitting from the drains notifying Dan and Arthur of its pending arrival; they and Ryan take cover in the basement bathroom's shower tub as the twister starts to obliterate the Hatch residence. After Dan and Arthur escape from the basement of the leveled house through the collapsing floor beams from the first floor, and look in awe of the rubble that was once the Hatches' home, Arthur runs into Stacey and Ronnie Vae, who both survived the twister themselves in the Darlington's home (their parents were out of town on a trip back home to California at the time the storm hit). As Dan struggles to find his own family, Laura and Jenny are trapped inside the Salty Dawg (as they were taking cover inside, due to Jenny's 1992 Buick Skylark malfunctioning when she went to pick up Laura), which also was destroyed by one of the tornadoes. Dan and Stacey then go save Belle, at her farm; the two teenagers find Belle underneath wooden boards blown onto her from off of the partially damaged barn near her house (which itself survived intact). As Dan and Stacey rush in the car to get Belle treated for her injuries, Dan finds Jack on a closed road, with his truck ‚Äì which was overturned by the tornado, pinning him underneath it ‚Äì covered in fallen power lines; he pulls Jack out from under the truck (with the help of emergency crews, after an earlier attempt by Dan and Stacey to push the truck in order to free him nearly injures Jack further), seeing this as an opportunity for his father to finally see him as reliable. However, Jack just gives a simple thank-you to the fact that Dan saved him from multiple dangers, even though his stepson may have been the only one down the road who was able to help him as it was blocked by policemen due to it being blocked by the downed lines, debris and broken underground utility lines. Later that night at the shelter, Dan reveals to Stacey that Jack only is his stepfather and that his real father, Daniel Sr., was a pilot who was killed in a plane crash when Dan was 6. After telling her that he feels he is not good enough in Jack's eyes and talks about the good qualities that his stepfather has, Stacey helps Dan consider that the two could try to find some common ground. Eventually, Jack, followed by Dan, who sneaks himself and Ryan into the Jeep Wagoneer loaned to Jack, leave the shelter to go and look for Laura. Just as Bob pulls his truck into the driveway of the destroyed house, helping passengers Jenny and Laura along with him searching for Jack, Dan and Ryan, Jack's Jeep also drives up and the family is reunited. As soon as everyone is relieved they survived the storm, three tornadoes touch down near them. Bob, realizing that there is no adequate shelter available, advises the group to make a run for it in their vehicles. The group narrowly escapes one of the twisters, which picks up a car that the Hatches' neighbors try to outrun the tornado in themselves, destroys several buildings in its path and hurls a tree branch into the windshield, briefly knocking Jack unconscious and prompting Dan to take over driving the vehicle out of the storm's path. They, along with Bob and Jenny, make it to an overpass as the twister blows out the back window of the Jeep, nearly sucking Dan out before it dissipates into the air. As they walk out from under the overpass just as the sun rises on a clear day after the storm passes, Jack admits he's proud of Danny for not giving up in the face of adversity and trying to reunite the family. In the film's epilogue, illustrating what happened with the characters one year after the storm, Dan explains that he is now dating Stacey, while Arthur became class president, Bob and Jenny got married and are becoming first-time parents to twins, Dan and Jack have also become closer, Jack is now supportive of him, and also taking up some new hobbies after his sporting goods shop was destroyed by the storm, and also Belle died in 1997.

The base of the obelisk makes no mention of his son who brought the obelisk to Rome. The Lateran Obelisk is the largest standing ancient Egyptian obelisk in the world, and it is also the tallest obelisk in Italy. It originally weighed , but after collapsing and being re-erected shorter, now weighs around . It is located in Rome, in the square across from the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran and the San Giovanni Addolorata Hospital. History Originally, the obelisk was created by Pharaoh Thutmose III (1479‚Äì1425 BC) for himself and another for his father, but neither were completed before his death. Thutmose III's grandson, Thutmose IV (1400‚Äì1390 BC) finished the obelisks and had them erected to the east of the great temple of Amun in Karnak. When it was completed, the obelisk now known as the Lateran Obelisk stood at 32m (105 ft) which was the tallest one in Egypt. Both it and the other obelisk, known as the Obelisk of Theodosius, were brought to Alexandria over the Nile by an obelisk ship in the early 4th century by Constantius II. He intended to bring both obelisks to Constantinople, the new capital for the Roman Empire. The Lateran Obelisk never made it. Circus Maximus After the obelisk remained in Alexandria for a few decades, Constantius II had the Lateran obelisk shipped to Rome when he made his only visit there in 357. It was erected near the Egyptian obelisk called the Flaminio, which had stood since 10 BC where it was installed by Augustus to decorate the spina of the Circus Maximus. There they both remained, until after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century the Circus Maximus was abandoned and they eventually broke or were taken down. They were eventually buried by mud and detritus carried by a small stream over time. First person accounts have the original (Roman) base of the monument still in the Circus Maximus as late as 1589., De Origine et Usu Obeliscorum, Rome 1797. pp. 51 It contained a narrative of Constantius' transport, raising, and dedication of \\"his father's\\" obelisk inscribed on its four sides as a long epigram., Inscriptionum Latinarum Selectarum Amplissima Collectio, Zurich 1828. Vol I, no. 38 (facs. ed.) Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano Though pieces of the obelisk had been found in the 14th and 15th centuries, serious excavation was only made possible under Pope Sixtus V. The three pieces of the Lateran obelisk were dug up in 1587, and after being restored by architect Domenico Fontana, the obelisk was re-erected approximately shorter. When it was erected near the Lateran Palace and basilica of St. John Lateran on 9 August 1588, it became the last ancient Egyptian obelisk to be erected in Rome. Its location was formerly the spot where the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius stood until 1538, when it was relocated to decorate the Piazza del Campidoglio on Capitoline Hill. The obelisk was topped with a cross and the pedestal was decorated with inscriptions explaining its Egyptian history and its travels to Alexandria and Rome, mentioning the baptism of Constantine the Great.

Chiengi is in the north-east corner of Lake Mweru, and at the foot of wooded hills dividing that lake from Lake Mweru Wantipa, and overlooking a dambo (marshy plain) stretching northwards from the lake, where the Chiengi rivulet (the origin of the name) flows down from the hills.Mr Justice J B Thomson: \\"Memories of Abandoned Bomas No. 8: Chiengi\\". Northern Rhodesia Journal, Vol II, No. 6, pp67‚àí77 (1954). History=Pre-colonial history Chiengi and the area just to its north were ravaged by the slave trade and related ivory trade in the 18th Century. Numerous Arab and Swahili slave traders such as Tippu Tib operated around the north end of Lake Mweru, around Lake Mweru Wantipa and over to Lake Tanganyika. Colonial history Chiengi boma was established during the race between Belgian King Leopold II's Congo Free State and the British South Africa Company (BSAC) of Cecil Rhodes to seize Katanga from its king, Msiri, in 1890-91. Alfred Sharpe was sent to obtain a treaty from Msiri by the BSAC from the British Commissioner's office at Zomba in Nyasaland in 1890, but he failed. On his way back to Nyasaland in early 1891 he passed the Chiengi rivulet and, since Chief Puta Chipalabwe who reigned as a Chief of the Bwile people between 1879-1909.BRE/SHAREII/USAID: Bwile CHiefdom Strategic Development Plan, 2013-2017, Lusaka. pp8 Bwile people, to the south, was amenable to a treaty, Sharpe decided to set up a boma there to secure the territory east of Mweru for the BSAC, and to act as a forward base for another attempt to wring a treaty out of Msiri. He left his second-in-command, Captain Crayshaw, with some African troops to build and staff the boma. However, Leopold sent the Stairs Expedition to secure Katanga which they achieved in December 1891 after killing Msiri. On the way back to the east coast of Africa, the Stairs Expedition passed close to Chiengi and exchanged messages with Crayshaw regarding the position of the border dividing CFS and BSAC territory between Lake Mweru and Lake Tanganyika. Chiengi Boma was probably the first colonial post in what was to be called North-Eastern Rhodesia (it was still referred to as part of 'Zambezia' at the time), and was one of the most remote outposts of the British Empire, a lonely posting which sent more than one colonial officer mad. For a number of years the boma was removed to the Kalungwishi River, and during this period the Belgian colonial authorities in Pweto, just across the border in DR Congo, controlled the northern end of the lake including the western extremity of Chiengi District, the so-called Lunchinda enclave west of the Lunchinda River. The British then re-established the boma at Chiengi but the eventual outcome of de facto Belgian control of the Lunchinda enclave led to it eventually being ceded to DR Congo by Zambia ‚Äî see the article on the Luapula Province border dispute. Chiengi Boma was finally closed in 1933 and superseded by Kawambwa and then Nchelenge bomas. In addition to fishing in the lake, the chief trade of Chiengi in colonial times was in salt, which had been deposited in the dambo by streams running out of the hills, and there was a thriving trade. History since Chiengi was restored as a sub-administrative administrative centre under Nchelenge District of independent Zambia in the 1970s and as a full administrative District in the 1990s. The area has been affected by conflict in the Congo several times, most recently in the Second Congo War, when tens of thousands of refugees arrived and were settled in UNHCR camps in Kawambwa and Mporokoso Districts. Most of these have been repatriated since the end of that war.Times of Zambia online. Website accessed 22 April 2007.

Other tales of this type include \\"Ferdinand the Faithful and Ferdinand the Unfaithful\\", \\"The Firebird and Princess Vasilisa\\", \\"Corvetto\\", and \\"The Mermaid and the Boy\\".Heidi Anne Heiner, \\"Tales Similar to Firebird\\" Synopsis A couple had no children. The husband went to a wise man, who offered him his choice of apples from a tree. He picked a white one and ate it. The wise man told him he would have a son within a year, but when the boy was fifteen, he would leave and take nothing. At that time, he should tell the boy to take what he found in the ruined hut at the end of a path. When the boy, Jean, was fifteen, it happened as the wise man had said, and his father told him to take what he found there. Jean found a bridled and saddled horse and rode off on it. Against the horse's advice, he looked to see what quarreling crows had dropped. When he found it was King Fortunatus's golden wig, he took it for Mardi Gras, though the horse warned him against it. It took him to the king and stayed in the forest, in a hut of branches, while Jean went to work for the king as a stable boy. The horses he cared for did so much better than the others' horses that he roused their envy. He found that the wig glowed and so used it instead of candles. When Mardi Gras came, he wore the wig. The king took him for a king's son, but Jean admitted to being his stable boy, and the king took the wig. The other stable boys told the king that Jean said he could marry King Fortunatus's daughter, and the king demanded that Jean bring her. Jean went to his horse in the forest, and it told him to get three ships, with beef, millet, and oats. They sailed up a river: first through the land of lions, where they threw out the beef, and the grateful king of the lions gave him a hair to call on the lions; then through the land of ants, where they threw out the millet, and the king of the ants gave him one of its hind legs; then through the land of geese, where they threw out the oats and the king of the geese gave him a feather. They arrived at King Fortunatus's lands. On hearing their mission, he sent them to rest before their tasks, but in the morning, he set him to sort all sorts of grain, which were heaped together in the granary, in one day; Jean rested all day and summoned the ants to do it, which did it so quickly that one ant had nothing to do. The next day, the king gave him a shell to empty a pool and sort out the fish into large and small in two basins. Jean rested again and summoned the geese, who emptied it. The king then had him chop down a forest, but Jean summoned the lions, who did it. The king agreed to let him take his daughter, but she warned Jean that she would set tasks as well. She bid farewell to her castle and threw the keys in the sea. When they returned, the princess demanded that her castle be brought; the horse had them return to near the princess's castle and have the lions summoned, which killed the lions that guarded her castle and attached it to their ship. The princess then demanded the keys to it. The horse had Jean sail out to sea and fire the cannon. The king of the fish came to complain of the noise, and Jean agreed to stop for the keys. When the princess received the keys, she demanded that Jean be burned. Jean went to the horse. It had him curry it and collect all the dust; then he was to add water to it, dig a hole by the pole, and wash himself and the shirt he was to be burned in with the water. When he did all this, the fire burned quickly, and Jean jumped out, alive and more handsome. The princess said she would be happy to marry the king if he were as handsome as Jean. The king had himself burned and died. The princess said that Jean had done all the work, and so married him instead. Commentary In legends, the hero is often sent after a woman for the king, not because of a wig, but because a strand of her hair fell into the king's hand.

Originally conceived as a fighter, the SVA was found inadequate for that role. Nevertheless, its impressive speed, range and operational ceiling, with its top speed making it one of the fastest of all Allied combat aircraft in World War I, gave it the right properties to be an excellent reconnaissance aircraft and even light bomber. Production of the aircraft continued well after the war, the final examples were delivered during 1918. The SVA was a conventionally laid-out unequal-span biplane - however, it was unusual in featuring Warren Truss-style struts joining its two wings, and therefore having no transverse (spanwise) bracing wires. The plywood-skinned fuselage had the typical Ansaldo triangular rear cross-section behind the cockpit, transitioning to a rectangular cross section going forwards through the rear cockpit area, with a full rectangular cross section forward of the cockpit. Two minor variants were produced, one with reconnaissance cameras, the other without cameras but extra fuel tanks. The Flight over Vienna propaganda flight, inspired by Italian nationalist and poet Gabriele d'Annunzio, consisting of an eleven plane flight of various models of Ansaldo SVA-series biplanes, was carried out on 9 August 1918 by the 87th Squadriglia La Serenissima from San Pelagio. At least two of the aircraft were twin-seater SVA.9 or SVA.10s to accommodate d'Annunzio himself for the flight he inspired, while the remainder were SVA.5 single-seaters. Development=Origins According to aviation author Gianni Cattaneo, prior to 1916, the aviation companies of Italy were commonly producing aircraft which lacked any substantial originality or possessed noteworthy performance attributes, albeit with some exceptions, such as the Caproni Ca.4 heavy bomber. While some figures within the industry were content to restrict their activity to forming arrangements to licence-produce foreign aircraft, particularly those of French origin, there were others who wanted to develop indigenous designs as well. What would become known as the SVA started life as the shared ideas of R. Verduzio and U. Savoia, two talented technical officers of Italy's Military Aviation Technical Directory.Cattaneo 1966, p. 3. Even as a concept, it represented a considerable evolution in design practices, instead of using empirical observations, actual calculations of aerodynamic and structural were performed; Cattaneo claims that this was a first for the Italian industry. A small design team, headed by aeronautical engineer Celestino Rosatelli, was assembled to work on turning the conceptual aircraft into reality. During its design phase, it was developed with the express goal of creating one of the fastest aircraft of its era, coupling this with a very high range capability and suitability for use as a fighter. The finalised proposals for what was then designated as the SV, was laid before the directors of Italian manufacturer Gio. Ansaldo & C., hoping to obtain their authorisation to proceed. However, the Military Aviation Technical Directory, having developed a considerable interest in the prospects of such an aircraft being produced, decided to assume control of the construction programme, effectively making it a government project. This came with some benefits, as the Italian government provided funding to cover the development along with the cooperation of various state agencies. Into flight During November 1916, Ansaldo commenced construction upon a new aircraft factory, known at Catiere 1, at Borzoli, outside Genoa; further factories were either established or acquired during the following two years. On 3 March 1917, the first SVA prototype performed its maiden flight from Grosseto, flown by Flight Sargeant M. Stoppani. Following this first flight, Stoppani was enthusiastic about his experience, favourably describing the prototype's handling characteristics and high speed. It was subjected to an intense test programme, being flown at various locations inside and outside Italy, for the purpose of validating the design's performance and viability.Cattaneo 1966, pp. 3‚Äì4. It was around this phase of work that it was decided to re-role the aircraft as a reconnaissance/fighter-bomber instead of a pure fighter, which represented a considerable shift in the specification; according to Cattaneo, this may have been done due to a perceived lack of maneuverability in comparison to some of its foreign competitors, such as the SPAD S.XIII and the Hanriot HD.1, and a lack of recognition amongst typical fighter pilots of its strengths, such as its speed and range.Cattaneo 1966, p. 4. Testing of the prototype had revealed the aircraft to possess speeds 30 MPH in excess of any aircraft serving on the Italian Front at that time. This outstanding speed, in combination with its range and load capabilities, made for an impressive fast reconnaissance aircraft, being able to dispense with escorts and break off from combat with opponents at will via its superior speed and rate of climb. However, it would not be confined solely to use within this role; during its service life, various sub-types and modifications were developed for a diverse range of purposes, which saw the aircraft being used to conduct numerous different duties. Initially, the prototype was followed by a slightly modified aircraft, known as the SVA.4; it functioned as a stepping stone towards the definitive production variant, the SVA.5. Into production In light of the prototype having demonstrated its capable performance characteristics, as well as the urgent demands imposed by the ongoing First World War, the SVA was rapidly ordered into production. During late 1917, volume manufacture of the type commenced; by the end of the year, an initial batch of 65 aircraft had been produced. A number of the early aircraft produced at Cantierre 3, one of the production lines, were used to test various modifications, particularly alternative engine installations. Reportedly, highly positive results were gathered on the Isotta Fraschini V.6, having cut the time to climb to 10,000 feet to only seven minutes, superior to widely used fighters such as the British Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 and the Germany Fokker D.VII. As such, during summer 1918, following confirmation of the performance figure via official testing conducted at Taliedo, outside Milan, it was decided to standardise the type upon the Isotta engine.Cattaneo 1966, p. 5. As a consequence of the type's outstanding performance, the Italian Air Force's High Command urged for the SVA to be provided in vast quantities; thus, production output made rapid advances. While only 65 aircraft had been completed by the end of 1917, 1,183 SVAs were build during 1918; this made the type the second-most numerous aircraft to be built by the Italian aviation industry.Cattaneo 1966, p. 7. Around late 1917 and early 1918, licences to produce the SVA were issued to several other aircraft manufacturers with the intention of achieving a high rate of production. Some of these licensees decided to perform their own modifications to the aircraft, such as reducing the length and span of the wings. On the basis of the first few months of operation, two distinct sub-models of the SVA were developed, both of these being twin-seater aircraft. The SVA.9, which was usually powered by the SPA 6A engine, was normally assigned for the training role. The SVA.10, powered by the Isotta engine, was intended for use as a light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft, armed with both a single fixed gun and a flexible Lewis gun, the latter of which being provisioned for use by the observer. Operational history During early 1918, the SVA started to be issued to the second-line units, which were typically responsible for defensive missions such as the guarding of various Northern Italian cities and conducting reconnaissance operations along the Italian Front.Cattaneo 1966, pp. 5‚Äì6. During February 1918, it formally commenced combined strategic reconnaissance and light bombing missions; for this purpose, special sections were organised and directly controlled by each headquarters of the Royal Italian Army. On 29 February, the first offensive operation was performed against railway infrastructure in Bolzano and Innsbruck.Cattaneo 1966, p. 6. During a typical bombing mission, aircraft would have to fly between 200 and 350 miles, which often included two crossings of the Alps; upon approaching the target, the pilot would descend to 1,000 feet prior to any strafing or bombing runs. Reconnaissance runs by the SVA were claimed to have played a major role during the Second Battle of the Piave River, providing Italian commanders with a near-continuous photographic representation of the turbulent battleground and helping them respond to rapid changes in the fighting. Imagery captured by one reconnaissance flight over the enemy harbour of Pula played a major role in a larger aerial bombing raid by 70 Italian aircraft several days later. The type also performed propaganda missions during the battle, dropping leaflets over the enemy lines. Perhaps the most daring reconnaissance missions on the Italian Front were performed by 87 Sqadriglia; on 21 May 1918, a pair of SVAs departed Ghedi, near Brescia, and conducted a four-hour flight almost entirely inside hostile territory, covering 430 miles and capturing imagery over the Austrian towns of Bregenz, Lindau, and the German town of Friedrichshafen, by Lake Constance. During this period, reconnaissance flights by the type were being performed of key railway depots on a near-daily basis, building up a detailed picture of the enemy's supply situation and the movement of reinforcements along the front. Cattaneo claims that the SVA had delivered remarkably effective performance in the reconnaissance role, especially for a single-engined, single-seat aircraft of the era.Cattaneo 1966, pp. 6‚Äì7. Perhaps the most audacious operation involving the SVA was conducted over the skies of Vienna, the capital of the Austria-Hungarian Empire, an act which effectively demonstrated the superiority of Italy over its opponent and its inability to prevent such flights from reaching into the heartland of the nation. On 9 August 1918, a flight of seven SVAs of the 87th Squadriglia La Serenissima, based in San Pelagio, flew over Vienna and dropped thousands of propaganda leaflets, which had been specially prepared by the poet, soldier, and nationalist Gabriele D'Annunzio. Cattaneo observes that bombs could have been carried instead of leaflets, but that this had not been the purpose of the mission. D'Annunzio himself participated in the flight as an observer on an SVA.9.; 11 SVAs were involved in all.Cattaneo 1966, pp. 8‚Äì9. Originally, the Vienna flight had been planned for 2 August 1918, but was delayed on account of unfavourable weather conditions on the day. The feat not only delivered a loud message of Italy's technological supremacy over Austria- Hungary, but forcefully delivered a warning of its rival's impending defeat to its own populace.Cattaneo 1966, p. 8. According to Cattaneo, the SVA had been quickly regarded as perhaps the most precious platform for intelligence gathering in Italian service and was particularly welcomed by its pilots, having amply satisfied a long-standing requirement for a fast scout/light bomber capable of effective self-protection.Cattaneo 1966, pp. 6, 8. It has been claimed that reconnaissance performed by the type had been vital in the preparation of a major offensive, which included the decisive Italian victory at the Battle of Vittorio Veneto. During this final major clash, SVAs also intervened directly against hostile ground units, performing strafing and bombing runs against troop concentrations, communication centers, depots, railway infrastructure, and airfields.Cattaneo 1966, p. 9. This action demonstrated the operational maturity of the platform, which included the development of torpedo-armed and floatplane models for the Regia Marina. The Battle of Vittorio Veneto effectively ended the war on the Italian Front and forced the withdrawal of the Austria-Hungarian Empire from the conflict.Cattaneo 1966, pp. 6, 8‚Äì9.

Promoted to the rank of major, he was given command of Fort Larned, Kansas in 1862. In April 1864, Downing came upon a band of Cheyenne camped near Cedar Canyon, 60 miles above the South Platte River. Although he only suspected them of stealing cattle and horses, Downing launched an attack that killed an estimated 25 Cheyennes and destroyed their lodges and belongings. Downing was also present at the Sand Creek massacre (also called the \\"Chivington massacre\\" after the officer in charge, Colonel John Chivington). In the ensuing outcry, he served as Chivington's legal counsel. Return to civilian life He mustered out of the army in 1864 or 1865 and returned to Denver. In 1867, Downing was elected probate judge of Arapahoe County, Colorado, for a term of two years. He acquired land, and took up developing real estate, farming, and raising cattle and horses. He acquired a ranch near Denver and made it into a showplace called \\"Downingdale\\". A civic leader, he was one of those who pushed for parks in the community, and originated the bill that led to the establishment of City Park. He also donated land and money for the Colfax Avenue streetcar and extended and improved Mount View Boulevard. When the Gentlemen's Driving and Riding Club of Denver, established in 1882 and whose members were \\"men who were leaders in the Denver business community and society\\", moved from Arlington Park to City Park, in the mid-1880s, \\"Downing acquired the property and maintained it as a clubhouse.\\" After his death in 1907, his widow converted the building into the Downing Home for Old People. South Downing Street in Denver is named after him. Personal life Caroline Eudora Rosecrans Downing, Representative Women of Colorado, 1914 On November 1, 1871, he married Caroline Rosecrans in Glen Falls, New York. She was an artist, musician and poet. Caroline Downing was the first member of the Ladies' Relief Society, president of the Ladies' Auxiliary to the Grand Army of the Republic and president of Pioneer Ladies' Aid Society.

Over a ten-year career he played in the National Football League (NFL), for the Baltimore Colts (1958 to 1960), and in the American Football League from 1961‚Äì1967, for the San Diego Chargers (1961‚Äì62) and the New York Jets (1963‚Äì67). He was an American Football League All-Star in 1964 and 1966 and a 1st Team All-Pro All-AFL in 1966. Plunkett played college football at Maryland State College, now known as the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. He was said to be able to \\"run like a reindeer\\" at his then playing weight of around 235 lbs. While there, he was involved in a little known but noteworthy gesture of good sportsmanship, when its coach told its players to ease up on their overmatched and under-manned opponents, Hofstra University. The then Flying Dutchmen had started the season with just twenty players before suffering injuries, and were in danger of having their program disbanded. Leading 28-0 at the time, Maryland State never scored again. According to Plunkett's teammate and future NFL star defensive back Johnny Sample, coach Vernon McCain, simply told his players, \\"This is the first time we are playing this school. We do not want to embarrass them.\\" Spared by their opponent's gallantry, Hofstra went on to finish the season a remarkable 7-3. Plunkett was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in 1956, but had his NFL debut delayed two years by being drafted into the US Army a few months later. He joined the Baltimore Colts in 1958 and was involved in what is dubbed as \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\" deciding that year's NFL championship. It resulted in both his and the Colts' first ever title win. They would repeat together in 1959. Described as \\"a lineman with a giant paunch but dancing feet\\",The Day Plunkett Took It Easy, New York Times Plunkett was known in his later playing years for his massive bulk,Sherman's Battle of the Bulge, Sports Illustrated being listed as high as 315 lbs. in an era when the typical offensive tackle in the 1960s weighed in between 260‚Äì275 lbs. Plunkett's coach on both the Colts and Jets, the legendary Weeb Eubank, tried everything - including bonuses, incentives for Plunkett's wife, and fines - but nothing worked to keep the older Plunkett near his target weight of 300 lbs. He retired just one year before the Jets' victory over the Colts in Super Bowl III in 1968. According to star Jets' quarterback Joe Namath, it was Plunkett who coined his iconic nickname \\"Broadway Joe\\", following Namath's appearance on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Plunkett died of cancer at the age of 56, at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore.

Prelude On February 26, 1838 the frozen ice of Lake Erie allowed 300 Canadian and American Patriots under the command of Major Lester Hoadley to take Pelee Island at the western end of the lake. This prompted British Colonel John Maitland to send a force to recapture the island and secure it from further attack. Maitland sent Major George Browne with 126 men, comprising two companies of the British 32nd Regiment, a detachment of the Canadian St. Thomas Volunteer Cavalry, and a small band of First Nations warriors to cut off the invaders.Mann, p. 76 Battle On March 3, 1838, Browne's force intercepted the Hunter Patriots on the ice off the south western shore of the island and defeated them in a sharp fight. The British and Canadian casualties were 5 killed (4 from the 32nd Regiment and 1 Canadian cavalryman) and 25 wounded. On the Patriot side, Hoadley, his second-in-command, Captain Van Rensselaer, and 12 rank and file were killed by enemy fire, in addition to 1 man who drowned when he fell through the ice. 18 Patriots were wounded and a further 11 were captured, some of whom were also badly wounded.

Plot summary A \\"Hitler Jugend\\" kind of story, set in the Soviet Union during the Second World War. Year 1943. Colonel Vishnevetskiy is released from prison to organize a school of military training for saboteurs. Students come from prisons and correction colonies; these are 14‚Äì15 years old criminals who nobody will even look for. After severe training they are sent to destroy a German oil depot deep in the Carpathians. Being lost high in the mountains and being on the edge of life and death, you still can make a choice: to remain a bastard or become a hero for a country that doesn't want you. Controversy The film's release caused massive controversy in Russia, where some deemed it \\"state-supported anti-Soviet propaganda\\". The plot for the film, written by Kunin, involved a story of teenagers with a criminal background who were caught by the NKVD during the Great Patriotic war, then trained as saboteurs in special schools and thrown into the German rear to face a certain death. After the film was shown in Russia, the Federal Security Service responded with a press-release, stating that archives of security services of Russia and Kazakhstan do not have any documents confirming the existence of \\"kid saboteur schools\\", and that there are no archive documents about missions to send saboteur groups consisting of teenagers into the adversary's rear. Although they did state that there are archive documents evidencing the use of kids in saboteur purposes by special services of Nazi Germany. While the advertising campaign of the film claimed it was based on real accounts, after the controversy arose both the writer and the director confessed the plot was mere fiction. While the film won the MTV Movie Awards, Russia for 2007, the famous director Vladimir Menshov refused to hand over the award: Dmitry Puchkov commented on the film making: Puchkov also commented on the information that Russian school students were obligated to watch this film: \\"Have our children to know the history of the country?

The Battle of Ayohuma (\\"dead man's head\\" in Quechua)L√≥pez, Vicente Fidel (1881).La revolucion argentina: su origen, sus guerras, y su desarrollo pol√≠tico hasta 1830, Volume 1. Imprenta y librer√≠a de Mayo, de C. Casavalle, p. 21 was an action fought on 14 November 1813, during the second Upper Peru Campaign of the Argentine War of Independence. The republican forces of the Army of the North, led by General Manuel Belgrano were defeated by the royalists, commanded by Joaqu√≠n de la Pezuela.  Background  After the rout of Vilcapugio, Belgrano established his headquarters at Macha. There he reorganized his army, obtaining help from Francisco Ocampo (then President of Charcas), and from the provinces of Upper Peru (Cochabamba, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and Chayanta). At the end of October 1813, the republican army included around 3,400 men, of which barely 1,000 were veterans. An important fraction of the republican army, under the command of General D√≠az V√©lez had remained isolated at Potos√≠ after Vilcapugio, but was able to reunite with Belgrano after a small action at Tambo Nuevo relieved them from the pressure of the royalist army.Mitre, Bartolom√©: Historia de Belgrano. Imprenta de Mayo, Buenos Aires, 1859. V. II., page 226 Leader of the Independentist Army of the North, General Manuel Belgrano. Despite their recent victory, Pezuela's troops were short of horses and supplies. They had sought refuge on the Condo-Condo heights, where, being surrounded by hostile populations and still recovering from the casualties suffered at Vilcapugio, they could not readily take the offensive against the Army of the North. However, on 29 October, they left their camp in Condo-Condo in order to attack the republicans before they could obtain further reinforcements. On 12 November, they arrived at Toquir√≠, a hill dominating the small plain of Ayohuma, half a league from the village of the same name.Paz, Jos√© Mar√≠a (1855). Memorias P√≥stumas. Imprenta de la Revista, p. 141. In the meantime, just two leagues away from Toquir√≠, on 8 November, Belgrano had discussed his plans with his officials. The majority of them wanted to withdraw to Potos√≠, but the general convinced his officers to fight. That same night the army left Macha, reaching Ayohuma on the morning of the next day.  Battle  The armies that were about to face each other exhibited a significant disproportion. While the republican cavalry outnumbered the royalists' two-to-one, Pezuela had twice as much infantry and 18 pieces of artillery, against only eight carried by Belgrano's troops. At dawn of 14 November the royalists began their descent from their high position and by mid-morning they had deployed the bulk of their forces on the plain. Belgrano's troops were meanwhile attending Mass, even if aware of the enemy movements. An hour later, Pezuela had completed their maneuver, outflanking the republicans on their right. In the opinion of Lieutenant Gregorio Ar√°oz de Lamadrid, one of Belgrano's best officers, this move proved decisive for the outcome of the battle.Ara√≥z de la Madrid, Gregorio: Obsebvaciones [sic] sobre las Memorias p√≥stumas del brigadier general d. Jos√® M. Paz, por G. Araoz de Lamadrid y otros gefes contemporaneos. Imprenta de la Revista, Buenos Aires, 1855, pp. 35‚Äì36. Then, Pezuela's artillery opened fire, blasting holes in the republicans ranks. In a hail of enemy fire, Belgrano ordered the advance of his infantry and cavalry toward the enemy right flank, but they could not overcame Pezuela's entrenchments. To make matters worse, the republicans' lighter guns were no match for the royalist ones. Belgrano was forced to retreat. By a trumpet call and waving the United Provinces flag on the top of a hill, he managed to gather some 500 men, leaving around 200 dead, 200 injured, 500 prisoners and almost all his artillery on the battlefield. Among the dead was the commander of the Batall√≥n de Castas (\\"Castes' Battalion\\"), Colonel Jos√© Super√≠, who was killed by the royalist artillery. His battalion was made of soldiers of African and mulatto descent. Jos√© Mar√≠a Paz, an officer who would later play a key role in the Argentine Civil Wars, had to rescue his brother, Captain Juli√°n Paz, when the latter's horse was killed by gunfire while crossing a stream. Three mulatto auxiliary women, Mar√≠a Remedios del Valle and her two daughters, became famous for their efforts to provide water to the troops and assist wounded soldiers on the battlefield in spite of the heavy royalist bombardment, and they are since remembered as the Ni√±as de Ayohuma (\\"Maidens of Ayohuma\\") in Argentina.Elgul de Par√≠s, Marta (1996). Amantes, Cautivas y Guerreras. Almagesto, p. 151. Aftermath Belgrano's 500 survivors retreated to Potos√≠, but the city had to be quickly evacuated on 18 November due to the approaching royalists. Belgrano moved back to Tucum√°n, where on 30 January 1814, he resigned the command of the Northern Army to General San Mart√≠n. He would later write about the tactical superiority of the Spaniard officers as compared to his limited knowledge of warfare.

Explanation of the subgenre Rape and revenge films generally follow the same three-act structure: * Act I: A usually female character is (violently) raped and maybe further abused, tortured or left for dead. * Act II: The character survives and may rehabilitate themselves. * Act III: The character exacts revenge and/or kills their rapist(s). In Gaspar No√©'s 2002 film Irr√©versible, the structure was reversed, with the first act depicting the revenge before tracing back the events which led to that point. Roger Ebert argues that, by using this structure as well as a false revenge, Irr√©versible cannot be classified as an exploitation film, as no exploitation of the subject matter takes place. The genre has attracted critical attention. Much of this critical attention comes from feminist critics examining the complex politics involved in the genre and its impact on cinema more generally. More recently, a broad analysis of the rape-revenge genre and concept was published in Rape-Revenge Films: A Critical Study, by Alexandra Heller-Nicholas. The book argues against a simplistic notion of the term \\"rape-revenge\\" and suggests a film-specific approach in order to avoid generalizing films which may \\"diverge not over the treatment of sexual assault as much as they do in regard to the morality of the revenge act.\\" In addition to American and French films, rape/revenge films have been made in Japan (e.g., Takashi Ishii's Freeze Me), Finland, Russia (The Voroshilov Sharpshooter), Argentina (e.g., I'll Never Die Alone; [2008]; original title: No Morir√© Sola), and Norway (e.g., The Whore [2009]; original title: Hora).

The route runs from an interchange at Interstate 495 (I-495) in Edgemoor north to DE 92 in Hanbys Corner. The route passes through the suburban areas of Brandywine Hundred, Bellefonte, and Arden. It intersects U.S. Route 13 (US 13) in Edgemoor, US 13 Business (US 13 Bus.) in Bellefonte, and I-95 near Bellevue State Park. DE 3 was built as a state highway during the 1920s and 1930s. By 1968, the route was designated between US 13 (now US 13 Bus.) north to DE 92 on Marsh Road. The route was moved to its current alignment and terminus by 1984. Route description DE 3 northbound in Arden DE 3 begins at an intersection with Lighthouse Road/Hay Road at an interchange with I-495 in an industrial section of Edgemoor, heading northwest on four- lane divided Edgemoor Road. After the I-495 interchange, the road passes over Norfolk Southern's Shellpot Secondary and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad lines before it intersects US 13 in areas of businesses. Past this intersection, DE 3 enters a more residential area as a three-lane undivided road with two southbound lanes and one northbound lane. The route narrows to two lanes and turns west and north, coming to an intersection with US 13 Bus. At this point, DE 3 turns northeast to form a concurrency with that route on four-lane undivided Philadelphia Pike, running through residential and commercial areas. DE 3 splits from US 13 Bus. at the northwest edge of the town of Bellefonte by turning northwest onto Washington Street Extension, a four-lane divided highway. The route passes to the southwest of Mount Pleasant High School and turns north onto Marsh Road, a four-lane undivided road that forms the western boundary of Bellevue State Park. The road becomes a divided highway as it comes to an interchange with I-95. Immediately after this interchange, DE 3 crosses under CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision railroad line and narrows into a two-lane undivided road that heads into Brandywine Hundred, passing east of a park and ride lot located at a church and running through residential neighborhoods and a few businesses. The route gains a center left- turn lane between Wilson Road/Veale Road and Silverside Road. The road curves northeast and forms the western border of the village of Arden. DE 3 turns north again past the Grubb Road/Harvey Road intersection and runs between neighborhoods to the west and woodland to the east, ending at an intersection with DE 92 in Hanbys Corner. Marsh Road continues north past this intersection as an unnumbered road toward the Pennsylvania border. DE 3 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 13,642 vehicles at the I-95 interchange to a low of 4,708 vehicles on Washington Street Extension. None of DE 3 is part of the National Highway System. History What is now DE 3 existed as a county road by 1920. Four years later, the road was upgraded to a state highway between Philadelphia Pike and Harvey Road. The state highway was extended north to Naamans Road by 1931. By 1968, DE 3 was designated to run from US 13 (now US 13 Bus.) north to DE 92 along Marsh Road. DE 4 was extended onto the Washington Street Extension portion of present-day DE 3 three years later. DE 4 was removed from Washington Street Extension by 1981. Three years later, DE 3 was extended to I-495 in Edgemoor. At this time, DE 3 was realigned to follow Washington Street Extension from Marsh Road to a concurrency with US 13 Bus., heading southwest along that route before heading southeast along Edgemoor Road.

He will remain in this form for the rest of the series. In addition, this is the first episode with less than five songs. The end of this episode has prototype animation in which Spin doesn't put away his magnifying glass at the end, he just zooms in. This episodes shows an in-depth look at the rainforests of Central and South America. It's structured around a journey through the layers of the forest, from the floor to the mid-layers to the canopy. During this journey the jaguar, tapir, leafcutter ant, howler monkey, basilisk lizard, poison arrow frog, parrot, tarantula, harpy eagle, piranha, vampire bat, hoatzin, uakari, three-toed sloth, and river dolphin are among the animals shown. Environmental issues surrounding deforestation are also looked at. This episode has four songs. The first is about all the life that lives in the rainforest (Greenhouse); the second is about the importance of finding food and the food chain (What Do You Want for Lunch); the third is about the rainforest canopy and all the birds that call it home (Bird's-Eye View); and the fourth is about the importance of keeping the rainforest safe (This Must Be the Place). _Amazing North America_ \\\\- November 15, 1994 This episode looks at North America's ecosystems from its deserts and swamps to its cities and tundra. Ground squirrels, polar bears, alligators, beavers, woodpeckers, Arctic wolves, rattlesnakes, musk oxen, raccoons, black bears, corn snakes and red-bellied turtles are featured. The diversity of the North American landscape, and how all its animals have adapted to it, are key points in the film. This episode has four songs. The first is about what animals need to do to survive in North America (I Gotta Be Wild); the second is about the places animals call home (Look Who's Moving In); the third is about difficulties in getting what animals want (To Get What You Want); and the fourth is about the winter season (Winter). _Adventures in Asia_ \\\\- December 20, 1994 The immense continent of Asia is explored. With such a large area to cover, Spin jumps from one place to the next including the Indonesian islands, the Arabian Peninsula, Indian jungles, and Chinese mountains. Some of the featured animals are the sea snake, Arabian oryx, dhole, proboscis monkey, tiger, Asian elephant, orangutan, white-bellied sea eagle, and giant panda. The difference between myth and reality is put to the test in uncovering the lifestyles of all these creatures. This episode has four songs. The first is about all the Asian legends, and how much truth is in them (Legends in Asia); the second is about territories (Get Off of My Turf); the third is about animal roughhousing and how important it is (Roughhouse); and the fourth is about all the life, human and animal, in Asia (Keep the Legends Alive). _Polar Prowl_ \\\\- January 3, 1995 In this episode, Spin takes the viewer on a trip to the Arctic and Antarctic. Animals such as humpback whales, penguins, orca whales, arctic terns, polar bears, elephant seals, caribou, musk oxen, fur seals, Kodiak bears, and walruses are explored. Additionally, the show examines the three ways animals survive the harsh cold; hibernation, insulation and migration. This episode has four songs. The first is about the cold temperatures and how the animals survive don't mind it (Cold, Cold, Cold); the second is about ways animals beat the cold (That's the Way We Do It Up Here); the third is about penguins, and names the 17 species (Penguins); and the fourth is a tribute to Antarctica (The Last Great Wilderness). _Hot Dogs and Cool Cats_ \\\\- February 20, 1996 *Note: This was the point where the series started airing on TV, so the episodes had to be cut down in length. Instead of one 45-minute episode, all VHS/DVDs released contained two 30 minute episodes. Also, beginning here, all episodes only have two songs. Only the VHS version has a bridging dog commercial between the two episodes, as they had further released separately. The second episode is also the first time Alan O'Day does not appear. In the first episode, Spin looks at dogs and tries to determine if there is a link between wild and tame dogs. The first song is about why dogs do what they do (Hey Dog), and the second is about the loyalty that dogs possess (Best Friends). In the second episode, Spin examines cats and learns that no matter how tame, they're always wild. The first song is about cats having an attitude (The Cat's Got an Attitude), and the second is about how they're wild inside (Wild Inside). _Dinosaurs and Other Creature Features_ \\\\- March 6, 1996 *Notes: This is the first episode where the background changes from the sky to outer space; this background, which had been in place since the first episode, will remain for the rest of the series. Also, Spin reads the title card as \\"Dinos and Other Creature Features\\". Paleontologist Robert T. Bakker appears in the first episode, and in the second episode, footage from the Three Stooges episode \\"Disorder in the Court\\" and a clip from Killer Shrews is shown. It's the only one to not feature Alan O'Day or Janis Liebhart singing the songs and the last episode where a guest singer was brought in. In the first episode, Spin examines dinosaurs such as Hadrosaurs (Duck-Billed Dinosaurs), Struthiomimus, Tyrannosaurus rex, and Dromaeosaurs (Raptors), and tries to answer the questions surrounding them, including how they became extinct, and if relatives still exist such as alligators, snakes, Komodo dragons, lizards, ostriches, cassowaries, and other birds. The songs focus on dinosaurs (Dinosaurs), and how their modern-day relatives still \\"rock our world\\" (We're Gonna Rock Your World). In the second episode, Spin looks at some of the world's creepiest creatures such as vampire bats, ants, flies, spiders, vultures, and dung beetles. He shows that no matter how scary they are, they all play an important part in the world. The first song is about how creatures are creepy and intriguing (Creepy Creatures; animation by Jim and Vezna Tozzi), and the second is about how important they all are (Keep on Creepin' on). _Monkey Business and Other Family Fun_ \\\\- November 12, 1996 *Note: Janis Liebhart performs both songs in the first episode; she only appears in a duet in the second episode. Also, this episode features a parody of Candid Camera called \\"Candid Critter Camera\\". It's hosted by \\"Alan Grunt\\" (a parody of Alan Funt), who is played by Billy West. Only the second \\"Candid Critter Camera\\" segment appears on the VHS and DVD versions, whereas the first \\"Candid Critter Camera\\", whose topic features meerkats, only appears in the VHS version, as the episodes had further released separately. In the first episode, Spin looks at primates, including gibbons, langurs, bush babies, aye-ayes, capuchins, and baboons. He also explains that primates are our distant relatives. The first song is about all primates (Primates), and the second is about gorillas, our \\"gentle brothers\\" (Gentle Brother). In the second episode, Spin looks at animal families including elephants, African bullfrogs, ostriches, octopuses, albatross, and sea turtles and shows that they're not all that different from human families. The first song is about how curious animal children are (I'm Curious), and the second is about how important families are (You're My Family). _Farmyard Friends_ \\\\- May 6, 1997 *Notes: This is the first VHS/DVD release that doesn't mention the second episode. The TV version of Farmyard Friends was titled Spin's Really Wild Farm Tour. Also, at this point, Warner Brothers became the distributor and started advertising before the episode began. In the first episode, Spin looks at farm animals, such as turkeys, pigs, sheep, horses, and cows, and examines their wild relatives, such as dall sheep, wild turkeys, warthogs, and zebras, from all over the world. The first song is about all the animals on the farm (Farmer, Farmer), and the second is about whether the viewer would be wild or tame (Would You Rather be Wild, Would You Rather be Tame). In the second episode, Spin looks at humans helping endangered animals, how animals rescue people and if people work together to save animals, they'll prevent them from becoming extinct. The first song is about help being available for animals (Help is on the Way), and the second is about humans working to save animals (Safe at Last). _Awesome Animal Builders_ \\\\- November 4, 1997 In the first episode, Spin shows animals that their own homes, such as termites, beavers, orb-weaver spiders, swiftlets, bees, silkworms, caterpillars, weaver birds, naked mole rats, and ospreys, and explains that they build their homes to have families. The first song is about the different kinds of animal homes (Anything to Make it Home) and the second is about why animals build homes (I Am an Architect). In the second episode, Spin looks at animals that migrate, such as wildebeest, sockeye salmon, tundra swans, African elephants, geese, sharks, rays, pronghorn and toads, and explains that the cycle of migration never ends. The first song is about animals migrating (I'm Movin' Out) and the second is about how migration never ends for animals (Every Ending is a Beginning) _Secret Weapons and Great Escapes_ \\\\- March 2, 1998 *Note: Despite this being the last episode, the show still ends with Spin saying, \\"But there are lots more Really Wild Animals all across this wonderful world of ours, so be sure to join me on our next adventure. Until then, this is your pal, Spin. Spin ya later!\\" This is presumed to encourage the viewer to start over again. In the first episode, Spin's a spy who is trying to find out how some animals have ways to defend themselves, such as frilled-neck lizards, poison dart frogs, owl butterflies, green tree pythons, Hemisphaerota beetles, army ants, skunks, Surinam toads, black widow spiders, bombardier beetles, mantis shrimp, cobras, tomato frogs, cone snails, and puffer fish, and finds why animals need defenses. The first song is about animals having secret defenses (I've Got a Secret) and the second is about animals needing watch out for other animals defenses (Trick of the Trade) In the second episode, Spin shows animals that live on certain islands, such as lemurs and chameleons in Madagascar, Marine and land iguanas on the Galapagos, Tasmanian devils and quolls in Tasmania, gannets and keas in New Zealand, fur seals on the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands and eastern rockhopper penguins with Snares penguins in Snares Island, and shows how unique they are. Footage of New York City and its Twin Towers are shown as well as the Herons and egrets on the harbor's islands. Both songs are about islands and how unique they are.

She was the Member of National Assembly (MNA) for the riding of Marguerite-Bourgeois in the Montreal region as a member of the Quebec Liberal Party between 1998 and 2009. With the government in power she was the Finance Minister from 2007 to 2009, the President of the Treasury Board and the Minister of government services and the Minister responsible of the government administration from 2003 to 2008. Education From 1960 to 1976, J√©r√¥me-Forget studied at several universities including the University of London (England) in economics, Johns Hopkins University in history, the Universit√© de Montr√©al in public economics and McGill University in psychology. At the end of her studies, she received a bachelor's and doctor's degree in psychology at McGill in 1972 and 1976 respectively. Professional career On completing her doctorate in psychology, J√©r√¥me-Forget began practice as a psychologist at the Royal Victoria Hospital (part of the McGill University Hospital Centre). From 1979 to 1982, she worked as the Director of Professional Services at the CLSC Metro, Montreal. From 1982 to 1985, she served as Assistant Deputy Minister in the federal Department of Health and Welfare in Ottawa. In 1985-86, she worked as the Vice-Rector, Finance, Institutional Research and Human Resources, at Concordia University in Montreal. From 1986 to 1990, she was Chair and CEO of Quebec‚Äôs Commission de la sant√© et de la s√©curit√© du travail (CSST). The Commission is responsible for workplace health and safety. She also was chair, Institut de recherche en sant√© et s√©curit√© du travail (IRSST). From 1991 to 1998, she was the CEO of the Institute for Research on Public Policy (IRPP). As well from 1993-1998 she was a columnist for the Financial Post and Les Affaires. Community involvement She has been heavily involved in the community, working for the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, la Cinematheque Qu√©b√©coise, the Quebec federation for the environment, the Social policies committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Medical Council of Canada and the Soci√©t√© investissement jeunesse. She was also a member of the Institute for Intergovernmental Relations of Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, as well as the McGill University Institute for Canadian Studies. She was the representative for Canada on the International Commission for Workers' Compensation. Political career=First mandate J√©r√¥me-Forget entered politics in 1998. She became the MNA for Marguerite-Bourgeoys in the 1998 elections and would serve as the opposition party's critic in finances when the Parti Qu√©b√©cois had their second mandate as a majority government. Second term She was re-elected for a second term in the 2003 elections, in which the Liberals won a majority government, and became a prominent force inside Jean Charest's cabinet as she was named the president of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Public Administration and Government Services. She was also for half the mandate the Minister responsible for the Montreal region until 2005 when the responsibilities were given to Culture Minister Line Beauchamp. As public administration minister she negotiated a six-year collective agreement covering half a million public sector employees and resolved a long-standing issue over pay equity affecting some 400,000, mostly female employees. As Treasury Board President she kept the nominal growth of public expenditure under 5% giving Quebec the slowest growing public sector of all Canadian governments. As a result, the credit rating of the Province of Quebec was increased on two occasions. She also put together the most important infrastructure program in the history of Quebec ($41 billion for the first five years) and introduced in that province the concept of Public- Private Partnerships (or PFI) and to oversee it, she set up an agency that has won two international prizes for the quality of its work. Under these initiates, as she resigned her position in the government some $10 billion of projects from highways to teaching hospitals and concert hall were under way. The program was enhanced in her third (2009‚Äì2010) budget as an important element in her recession fighting strategy. Third term She was easily re-elected for a third term in the 2007 elections. After the election, she became one of the senior ministers of the new minority government as Premier Charest gave her additional responsibilities including the portfolio of Governmental Services, previously held by Henri-Francois Gautrin, and Finances which had been held by Michel Audet who did not seek a re-election in 2007. She became the first minister since Jacques Parizeau to hold both the positions of President of the Treasury Board and Minister of Finances. Her 2007 budget provided for a $700 million reduction in personal income tax. It also initiated a phased abolition of the capital tax on businesses and continued a policy of significant funding increments to the health and education missions. These moves on the fiscal front were designed to implement campaign commitments to lighten the fiscal burden in Quebec to a more reasonable level as compared with other provinces. Over the period 2007-2008, she supervised the negotiations that led to the \\"Montreal Accord\\" to deal with the problem with asset-backed commercial paper. The Parti Qu√©b√©cois and Action d√©mocratique du Qu√©bec declared that they would vote against the budget. However, only three PQ members were present for the budget vote on June 1, 2007 so that the minority Liberal government got its budget approved as the Parti Qu√©b√©cois clearly did not want to provoke an election. Fourth term She was easily re-elected for a fourth time in her riding in the 2008 elections. At her request, she gave up her portfolio of government services to Bellechasse MNA Dominique Vien as well as the position of President of the Treasury Board to former Finances Minister and former Deputy Premier Monique Gagnon-Tremblay but kept the responsibility for the Infrastructures program. In this last capacity, she signed several infrastructure agreements with her federal counterpart then also engaged in an anti-recession program. The global credit crisis had gathered steam during the 2007-2008 period. It was compounded by a stock market collapse in October 2008. In the last months of 2008, she played a key role in developing a joint effort by the Alberta, Ontario and Federal governments, and of course that of Quebec, in providing guarantees to holders of asset backed commercial paper. This financial crisis had until then a relatively mild impact of the Quebec economy. This however was to change in the last days of 2008 and the first months of 2009. In her third budget, presented on March 14, 2009, there was a major shift from the budget balance of previous years into a significant $3.9 billion deficit that the difficult circumstances made both inevitable and desirable to stimulate aggregate demand in the economy. She announced in that budget and the economic statement made in January several stimulative measures such a program called REA-II as well as additional funding of $100 million each for Investissements Quebec and the Societe G√©n√©rale de Financement. The budget anticipated a return to equilibrium over the next four years and anticipated a rise of the provincial sales tax of one percent as of January 2011, as well as yearly cost-of-living related increases in charges and fees for government services as of the same date. However, she was clear that other, unspecified tax increases or expenditures cutbacks would be needed to restore a balanced budget. In the beginning of February, a formal announcement of nearly $40 billion of losses were made by the Caisse de d√©p√¥t et placement du Qu√©bec for 2008, the worst results in the Caisse's history. These results (and even their anticipation given the dramatic declines in asset prices over the preceding months) generated a lot of debates and questions about the quality of risk management practices at the Caisse, the nature of its objectives and the adequacy of its management. All that was accompanied by many changes in that management including the Board, the Chair and the CEO's position. A federal- provincial tax controversy ensued one week later following the decision by the Ontario government to harmonize the PST and the GST. After the federal government offered $4 billion to Ontario in compensation for the tax move, J√©r√¥me-Forget and the Quebec government requested a $2.6 billion compensation from Ottawa. The province had received no money when it harmonized both taxes in the 1990s.LCN, Le Canal Nouvelles On April 8, 2009, J√©r√¥me-Forget announced her retirement from politics.source, Radio Canada She was named a Member of the Order of Canada in 2015.\\"Four Nova Scotians among Order of Canada honourees\\".

They comprise the anteromedial, anterodorsal, and anteroventral nuclei. Inputs and outputs The anterior nuclei receive afferents from the mammillary bodies via the mammillothalamic tract and from the subiculum via the fornix. In turn, they project to the cingulate gyrus. The anterior nuclei of the thalamus display functions pertaining to memory. Persons displaying lesions in the anterior thalamus, preventing input from the pathway involving the hippocampus, mammillary bodies and the MTT, display forms of amnesia, supporting the anterior thalamus's involvement in episodic memory. However, although the hypothalamus projects to both the mammillary bodies and the anterior nuclei of the thalamus, the anterior nuclei receive input from hippocampal cells deep to the pyramidal cells projecting to the mammillary bodies. These nuclei are considered to be association nuclei, one of the three broader subdivisions of thalamic nuclei. These nuclei receive input from the cerebral cortex. The input received is integrated and re-directed back to the cortical areas of the cerebrum known as association areas. The anterior nuclei regulates what input is redistributed to the cortex. The connections of the anterior nuclei are similar to that of the lateral dorsal (LD) nuclei. Function These nuclei are thought to play a role in the modulation of alertness and are involved in learning and episodic memory. They are considered to be part of the limbic system. The anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) are recently thought to be connected in pathways serving a spatial navigation role in reference to propagating head movements. The ATN displays bidirectional connections with the postsubiculum, a structure in humans involved in regulating signaling relative to the movement of the head in the horizontal plane. This structure contains \\"head direction cells\\" hypothesized to also be present in the ATN. These head direction cells fire in response to an animal pointing its head in a certain direction. Ultimately, the firing sequences of these cells encode information allowing an animal to perceive its direction in relation to its spatial environment.

While the poem was written in 1833, it was not published, in its entirety, until after his death as his work was under censorship due to the political nature of his other writings. Widely considered to be Pushkin's most successful narrative poem, The Bronze Horseman has had a lasting impact on Russian literature. The Pushkin critic A. D. P. Briggs praises the poem \\"as the best in the Russian language, and even the best poem written anywhere in the nineteenth century\\".Briggs, A. D. P. \\"Mednyy vsadnik [The Bronze Horseman]\\". The Literary Encyclopedia. 26 April 2005.accessed 30 November 2008. It is considered one of the most influential works in Russian literature, and is one of the reasons Pushkin is often called the ‚Äúfounder of modern Russian literature.‚Äù The statue became known as The Bronze Horseman due to the great influence of the poem.For general comments on the poem's success and influence, see Binyon, T. J. (2002), Pushkin: A Biography. London: Harper Collins, p. 437; Rosenshield, Gary. (2003), Pushkin and the Genres of Madness. Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press, p. 91; Cornwell, Neil (ed.) (1998), Reference Guide to Russian Literature. London: Taylor and Francis, p. 677.  Plot summary  The poem is divided into three sections: a shorter introduction (90 lines) and two longer parts (164 and 222 lines). The introduction opens with a mythologized history of the establishment of the city of Saint Petersburg in 1703. In the first two stanzas, Peter the Great stands at the edge of the River Neva and conceives the idea for a city which will threaten the Swedes and open a \\"window to Europe\\". The poem describes the area as almost uninhabited: Peter can only see one boat and a handful of dark houses inhabited by Finnish peasants. Saint Petersburg was in fact constructed on territory newly gained from the Swedes in the Great Northern War, and Peter himself chose the site for the founding of a major city because it provided Russia with a corner of access to the Baltic Sea, and thus to the Atlantic and Europe. The rest of the introduction is in the first person and reads as an ode to the city of Petersburg. The poet-narrator describes how he loves Petersburg, including the city's \\"stern, muscular appearance\\" (l. 44), its landmarks such as the Admiralty (ll. 50‚Äì58), and its harsh winters and long summer evenings (ll. 59 ‚Äì ll. 84). He encourages the city to retain its beauty and strength and stand firm against the waves of the Neva (ll. 85‚Äì91). Part I opens with an image of the Neva growing rough in a storm: the river is \\"tossing and turning like a sick man in his troubled bed\\" (ll. 5‚Äì6). Against this backdrop, a young poor man in the city, Evgenii, is contemplating his love for a young woman, Parasha, and planning to spend the rest of his life with her (ll. 49‚Äì62). Evgenii falls asleep, and the narrative then turns back to the Neva, with a description of how the river floods and destroys much of the city (ll. 72‚Äì104). The frightened and desperate Evgenii is left sitting alone on top of two marble lions on Peter's Square, surrounded by water and with the Bronze Horseman statue looking down on him (ll. 125‚Äì164). In Part II, Evgenii finds a ferryman and commands him to row to where Parasha's home used to be (ll. 26 ‚Äì ll. 56). However, he discovers that her home has been destroyed (ll. 57‚Äì60), and falls into a crazed delirium and breaks into laughter (ll. 61‚Äì65). For a year, he roams the street as a madman (ll. 89‚Äì130), but the following autumn, he is reminded of the night of the storm (ll. 132‚Äì133) and the source of his troubles. In a fit of rage, he curses the statue of Peter (ll. 177‚Äì179), which brings the statue to life, and Peter begins pursuing Evgenii (ll. 180‚Äì196). The narrator does not describe Evgenii's death directly, but the poem closes with the discovery of his corpse in a ruined hut floating on the water (ll. 219‚Äì222).  Genre  Formally, the poem is an unusual mix of genres: the sections dealing with Tsar Peter are written in a solemn, odic, 18th-century style, while the Evgenii sections are prosaic, playful and, in the latter stages, filled with pathos.See V. Ia. Briusov's 1929 essay on \\"The Bronze Horseman\\", available here (in Russian). This mix of genres is anticipated by the title: \\"The Bronze Horseman\\" suggested a grandiose ode, but the subtitle \\"A Petersburg Tale\\" leads one to expect an unheroic protagonistRosenshield, p. 91. Metrically, the entire poem is written in using the four-foot iamb, one of Pushkin's preferred meters, a versatile form which is able to adapt to the changing mood of the poem. The poem has a varied rhyme scheme and stanzas of varying length.Little, p. xiv. The critic Michael Watchel has suggested that Pushkin intended to produce a national epic in this poem, arguing that the Peter sections have many of the typical features of epic poetry.Wachtel, Michael. (2006) \\"Pushkin's long poems and the epic impulse\\". In Andrew Kahn (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to Puskhin, Cambridge: CUP, pp. 83‚Äì84. He points to Pushkin's extensive use of Old Testament language and allusions when describing both the founding of St Petersburg and the flood and argues that they draw heavily on the Book of Genesis. Further evidence for the categorization of Pushkin's poem as an epic can be seen in its rhyme scheme and stanza structure which allow the work to convey its meaning in a very concise yet artistic manner.Newman, John Kevin. \\"Pushkin's Bronze Horseman and the Epic Tradition.\\" Comparative Literature Studies 9.2 (1972): p. 187.JSTOR. Penn State University Press. Another parallel to the classical epic tradition can be drawn in the final scenes of Evgenii's burial described as ‚Äúfor God‚Äôs sake.‚Äù In Russian, this phrase is not one of ‚Äúchafing impatience, but of the kind of appeal to Christian sentiment which a beggar might make‚Äù according to Newman.Newman, p. 190 Therefore, it is a lack of empathy and charity in Petersburg that ultimately causes Evgenii's death. The requirement that civilization must have a moral order is a theme also found in the writings of Virgil. However, he adds that the Evgenii plot runs counter to the epic mode, and praises Pushkin for his \\"remarkable ability to synthesize diverse materials, styles and genres\\".Wachtel, p. 86. What is particularly unusual is that Pushkin focuses on a protagonist that is humble as well as one that is ostensibly great. There are more questions than answers in this new type of epic, where ‚Äúan agnostic irony can easily find a place‚Äù while ‚Äúthe unbiased reader would be forced to recognize as concerned with the profoundest issues which confront humanity‚Äù.Newman, p. 176 He concludes that if the poem is to be labeled a national epic, it is a \\"highly idiosyncratic\\" one.  Historical and cultural context  Several critics have suggested that the immediate inspiration for \\"The Bronze Horseman\\" was the work of the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz.Pushkin's own footnotes refer to Mickiewicz's poem 'Oleskiewicz' which describe the 1824 flood in Petersburg. See also Little, p. xiii; Binyon, pp. 435‚Äì6 Before beginning work on \\"The Bronze Horseman\\", Pushkin had read Mickiewicz's Forefathers' Eve (1823‚Äì32), which contains a poem entitled \\"To My Muscovite Friends\\", a thinly-veiled attack on Pushkin and Vasily Zhukovsky for their failure to join the radical Decembrist revolt of 1825. Forefather's Eve contains poems where Peter I is described as a despot who created the city because of autocratic whim, and a poem mocks the Falconet statue as looking as though he is about to jump off a precipice. Pushkin's poem can be read in part as a retort to Mickiewicz, although most critics agree that its concerns are much broader than answering a political enemy.See Binyon, p. 435; Little, p. xiii; Bayley, John (1971), Pushkin: A Comparative Commentary. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 128. There are distinct similarities between Pushkin's protagonist in The Bronze Horseman, and that of his other work ‚ÄúEvgeni Onegin.‚Äù Originally, Pushkin wanted to continue ‚ÄúEvgeni Onegin‚Äù in this narrative, and instead chose to make a new Evgenii, with a different family name but that was still a ‚Äúcaricature of Pushkin‚Äôs own character‚Äù.Wilson, p. 67. Both were descendants of the old regime of Boyars that now found itself socially insignificant in a society where family heritage wasn‚Äôt esteemed.  The statue  The Bronze Horseman of the title was sculpted by √âtienne Maurice Falconet and completed in 1782. Catherine the Great, a German princess that married into the Romanov family, commissioned the construction of the statue to legitimate her rule and claim to the throne to the Russian people. Catherine came to power through an illegal palace coup. She had the statue inscribed with the phrase, –ü–µ—Ç—Ä—É –ø–µ—Ä—å–≤–æ–º—É –ï–∫–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–∞ –≤—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è, –ª—£—Ç–∞ 1782, in both Latin and Russian, meaning Peter the first Catherine the second, both to show reverence to the ruler and indicate where she saw her place among Russia's rulers. The statue took 12 years to create. It depicts Peter the Great astride his horse, his outstretched arm reaching toward the Neva River in the western part of the country. The statue is lauded for its ambiguity; it is said Pushkin felt the ambiguous message of the statue and was inspired to pen the poem. In a travelogue about Petersburg in 1821, the French statesman Joseph de Maistre commented that he did not know \\"whether Peter's bronze hand protects or threatens\\".  The city of St. Petersburg  St. Petersburg was built by Peter the Great at the beginning of the 18th century, on the swampy shores and islands of the Neva. The difficulties of construction were numerous, but Peter was unperturbed by the expenditure of human life required to fulfil his vision of a city on the coast. Of the artisans whom he compelled to come north to lay the foundations of the city, thousands died of hardship and disease; and the city, in its unnatural location, was at the mercy of terrible floods caused by the breaking-up of the ice of the Lake Ladoga just east of it or- as on the occasion described in the poem- by the west wind blowing back the Neva. There had been one such devastating flood in 1777 and again in 1824, during Pushkin's time and the flood modeled in the poem, and they continued until the Saint Petersburg Dam was built.  Themes = Statue vs. Evgenii  The conflict between Tsar and citizen, or empire and individual, is a key theme of \\"The Bronze Horseman\\".Little, p. xix; Bayley, p. 131. Critics differ as to whether Pushkin ultimately sides with Evgenii ‚Äî the little man ‚Äî or Peter and historical necessity. The radical 19th-century critic Vissarion Belinsky considered the poem a vindication of Peter's policies, while the writer Dmitri Merezhkovsky thought it a poem of individual protest.Cited in Banjeree, Maria. (1978) \\"Pushkin's 'The Bronze Horseman': An Agonistic Vision\\". Modern Languages Studies, 8, no. 2, Spring, p. 42. Another interpretation of the poem suggests that the statue does not actually come to life, but that Evgenii loses his sanity. Pushkin makes Evengii go mad to create ‚Äúa terrifying dimension to even the most humdrum personality and at the same time show the abyss hidden in the most apparently common-place human soul‚Äù. In this regard, Evgenii is seen to become a disinherited man of the time in much the same vein as a traditional epic hero.Newman, p. 189. Perhaps Evgenii is not Peter's enemy at all. According to Newman, ‚Äú[Evgenii] is too small for that.‚ÄùNewman, p. 175, Instead, the heroic conflict of the poem is between Peter the Great and the elements while Evgenii is merely its ‚Äúimpotent victim.\\" Newman, p. 180. As Evgenii becomes more and more distressed at the disappearance of his fianc√©e, his increasing anxiety is juxtaposed with the indifference of the ferryman who rows him across the river. Newman thus calls into question whether or not Evgenii is justified in these feelings and how these feelings reflect his non-threatening position in relation to the statue.  Man's position in relation to nature  In the very act of conceiving and creating his city in the northern swamps, Peter has imposed order on the primeval natural scene depicted at the beginning of the poem. The city itself, \\"graceful yet austere\\" in its classical design, is, as much as the Falconet statue, Peter's living monument, carrying on his struggle against the \\"wild, tumultuous\\" Finnish waves. Its granite banks may hold the unruly elements in check for most of the time, but even they are helpless against such a furious rebellion as the flood of 1824. The waves‚Äô victory is, admittedly, short-lived: the flood soon recedes and the city returns to normal. Even so, it is clear that they can never be decisively defeated;they live to fight another day. A psychoanalytical reading by Daniel Rancour- Laferriere suggests that there is an underlying concern with couvade syndrome or male birthing in the poem. He argues that the passages of the creation of Petersburg resemble the Greek myth of Zeus giving birth to Athena, and suggests that the flood corresponds to the frequent use of water as a metaphor for birth in many cultures. He suggests that the imagery describing Peter and the Neva is gendered: Peter is male and the Neva female.Rancour-Laferriere, Daniel. \\"The Couvade of Peter the Great: A Psychoanalytic Aspect of The Bronze Horseman\\", D. Bethea (ed.), Pushkin Today, Indiana University Press, Bloomington, pp. 73‚Äì85.  Immortality  Higher authority is represented most clearly by Peter. What is more, he represents it in a way which sets him apart from the mass of humanity and even (so Pushkin hints, as we shall see) from such run-of-the-mill autocrats as Alexander I. Only in the first twenty lines of the poem does Peter appear as a living person. The action then shifts forward abruptly by a hundred years, and the rest of the poem is set in a time when Peter is obviously long since dead. Yet despite this we have a sense throughout of Peter's living presence, as if he had managed to avoid death in a quite unmortal way. The section evoking contemporary St Petersburg‚Äì Peter's youthful creation, in which his spirit lives on‚Äìinsinuates the first slight suggestion of this. Then comes a more explicit hint, as Pushkin voices the hope that the Finnish waves will not ‚Äòdisturb great Peter‚Äôs ageless sleep‚Äô. Peter, we must conclude, is not dead after all: he will awake from his sleep if danger should at any time threaten his capital city, the heart of the nation. Peter appears not as an ordinary human being but as an elemental force: he is an agent in the historical process, and even beyond this he participates in a wider cosmic struggle between order and disorder. Evgenii is accorded equal status with Peter in purely human terms, and his rebellion against state power is shown to be as admirable and significant in its way as that of the Decembrists. Yet turning now to the question of Evgenii's role in the wider scheme of things, we have to admit that he seems an insignificant third factor in the equation when viewed against the backdrop of the titanic struggle taking place between Peter and the elements. Evgenii is utterly and completely helpless against both. The flood sweeps away all his dreams of happiness, and it is in the river that he meets his death. Peter's statue, which at their first \\"encounter\\" during the flood had its back turned to Evgenii as if ignoring him, late hounds him mercilessly when he dares to protest at Peter's role in his suffering. The vast, impersonal forces of order and chaos, locked in an unending struggle ‚Äì these, Pushkin seems to be saying, are the reality: these are the millstones of destiny or of the historical process to which Evgenii and his kind are but so much grist.  Symbolism = The river  Peter the Great chose the river and all of its elemental forces as an entity worth combating. Peter \\"harnesses it, dresses it up, and transforms it into the centerpiece of his imperium.‚ÄùRosenshield, p. 141. However, the river cannot be tamed for long. It brings floods to Peter's orderly city as ‚ÄúIt seethes up from below, manifesting itself in uncontrolled passion, illness, and violence. It rebels against order and tradition. It wanders from its natural course.‚ÄùRosenshield, p. 131. ‚ÄúBefore Peter, the river lived in an uneventful but primeval existence‚Äù and though Peter tries to impose order, the river symbolizes what is natural and tries to return to its original state. ‚ÄúThe river resembles Evgenii not as an initiator of violence but as a reactant. Peter has imposed his will on the people (Evgenii) and nature (the Neva) as a means of realizing his imperialistic ambitions‚Äù and both Evgenii and the river try to break away from the social order and world that Peter has constructed.  The Bronze Horseman  The Bronze Horseman symbolizes \\"Tsar Peter, the city of St Petersburg, and the uncanny reach of autocracy over the lives of ordinary people.\\"Weinstock, p. 60. When Evgenii threatens the statue, he is threatening ‚Äúeverything distilled in the idea of Petersburg.‚Äù At first, Evgenii was just a lowly clerk that the Bronze Horseman could not deign to recognize because Evgenii was so far beneath him. However, when Evgenii challenges him, \\"Peter engages the world of Evgenii\\" as a response to Evgenii's arrogance.Rosenshield, p. 136. The \\"statue stirs in response to his challenge\\" and gallops after him to crush his rebellion. Before, Evgenii was just a little man that the Bronze Horseman would not bother to respond to. Upon Evgenii's challenge, however, he becomes an equal and a rival that the Bronze Horseman must crush in order to protect the accomplishments he stands for.  Soviet analysis  Alexander Pushkin on Soviet poster Pushkin's poem became particularly significant during the Soviet era. Pushkin depicted Peter as a strong leader, so allowing Soviet citizens to praise their own Peter, Joseph Stalin. Stalin himself was said to be ‚Äúmost willingly compared‚Äù to Peter the Great.Newman, p. 175. A poll in Literaturnyi sovremennik in March 1936 reported praise for Pushkin's portrayal of Peter, with comments in favour of how The Bronze Horseman depicted the resolution of the conflict between the personal and the public in favour of the public. This was in keeping with the Stalinist emphasis of how the achievements of Soviet society as a whole were to be extolled over the sufferings of the individual. Soviet thinkers also read deeper meanings into Pushkin's works. Andrei Platonov wrote two essays to commemorate the centenary of Pushkin's death, both published in Literaturnyi kritik. In Pushkin, Our Comrade, Platonov expanded upon his view of Pushkin as a prophet of the later rise of socialism. Pushkin not only 'divined the secret of the people', wrote Platonov, he depicted it in The Bronze Horseman, where the collision between Peter the Great's ruthless quest to build an empire, as expressed in the construction of Saint Petersburg, and Evgenii's quest for personal happiness will eventually come together and be reconciled by the advent of socialism. Josef Brodsky‚Äôs A Guide to a Renamed City \\"shows both Lenin and the Horseman to be equally heartless arbiters of other‚Äôs fates,\\" connecting the work to another great Soviet leader. Soviet literary critics could however use the poem to subvert those same ideals. In 1937 the Red Archive published a biographical account of Pushkin, written by E. N. Cherniavsky. In it Cherniavsky explained how The Bronze Horseman could be seen as Pushkin's attack on the repressive nature of the autocracy under Tsar Nicholas I. Having opposed the government and suffered his ruin, Evgenii challenges the symbol of Tsarist authority but is destroyed by its terrible, merciless power. Cherniavsky was perhaps also using the analysis to attack the Soviet system under Stalin. By 1937 the Soviet intelligentsia was faced with many of the same issues that Pushkin's society had struggled with under Nicholas I. Cherniavsky set out how Evgenii was a symbol for the downtrodden masses throughout Russia. By challenging the statue, Evgenii was challenging the right of the autocracy to rule over the people. Whilst in keeping with Soviet historiography of the late Tsarist period, Cherniavsky subtly hinted at opposition to the supreme power presently ruling Russia. He assessed the resolution of the conflict between the personal and the public with praise for the triumph of socialism, but couched it in terms that left his work open to interpretation, that while openly praising Soviet advances, he was using Pushkin's poem to criticise the methods by which this was achieved.  Legacy and adaptations  The work has had enormous influence in Russian culture. The setting of Evgenii's defiance, Senate Square, was coincidentally also the scene of the Decembrist revolt of 1825. Within the literary realm, Dostoyevsky's The Double: A Petersburg Poem [–î–≤–æ–π–Ω–∏–∫] (1846) directly engages with \\"The Bronze Horseman\\", treating Evgenii's madness as parody.Rosenshield, p. 5. The theme of madness parallels many of Gogol's works and became characteristic of 19th and 20th century Russian literature.Newman, p. 180. Andrei Bely's novel Petersburg [–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥] (1913; 1922) uses the Bronze Horseman as a metaphor for the centre of power in the city of Petersburg, which is itself a living entity and the main character of Bely's novel.Cornwell, p. 160. The bronze horseman, representing Peter the Great, chases the novel's protagonist, Nikolai Albleukov. He is thus forced to flee the statue just like Evgenii. In this context, Bely implies that Peter the Great is responsible for Russia's national identity that is torn between Western and Eastern influences. Other literary references to the poem include Anna Akmatova's \\"Poem Without a Hero\\", which mentions the Bronze Horseman \\"first as the thudding of unseen hooves.\\" Later on, the epilogue describes her escape from the pursuing Horseman. In Valerii Briusov's work ‚ÄúTo the Bronze Horseman‚Äù published in 1906, the author suggests that the monument is a \\"representation of eternity, as indifferent to battles and slaughter as it was Evgenii‚Äôs curses\\".Weinstock, p. 59. Nikolai Myaskovsky's 10th Symphony (1926‚Äì7) was inspired by the poem. In 1949 composer Reinhold Gli√®re and choreographer Rostislav Zakharov adapted the poem into a ballet premiered at the Kirov Opera and Ballet Theatre in Leningrad. This production was restored, with some changes, by Yuri Smekalov ballet (2016) at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg. The ballet has re-established its place in the Mariinsky repertoire.

Human GCPII contains 750 amino acids and weighs approximately 84 kDa. GCPII is a zinc metalloenzyme that resides in membranes. Most of the enzyme resides in the extracellular space. GCPII is a class II membrane glycoprotein. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) to glutamate and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) according to the reaction scheme to the right. Neuroscientists primarily use the term NAALADase in their studies, while those studying folate metabolism use folate hydrolase, and those studying prostate cancer or oncology, PSMA. All of which refer to the same protein glutamate carboxypeptidase II. Discovery GCPII is mainly expressed in four tissues of the body, including prostate epithelium, the proximal tubules of the kidney, the jejunal brush border of the small intestine and ganglia of the nervous system. Indeed, the initial cloning of the cDNA encoding the gene expressing PSMA was accomplished with RNA from a prostate tumor cell line, LNCaP. PSMA shares homology with the transferrin receptor and undergoes endocytosis but the ligand for inducing internalization has not been identified. It was found that PSMA was the same as the membrane protein in the small intestine responsible for removal of gamma-linked glutamates from polygammaglutamate folate. This enables the freeing of folic acid, which then can be transported into the body for use as a vitamin. This resulted in the cloned genomic designation of PSMA as FOLH1 for folate hydrolase. PSMA(FOLH1)+ folate polygammaglutamate(n 1-7)---> PSMA (FOLH1) + folate(poly)gammaglutamate(n-1) + glutamate continuing until releasing folate.  Structure  The three domains of the extracellular portion of GCPII‚Äîthe protease, apical and C-terminal domains‚Äîcollaborate in substrate recognition. The protease domain is a central seven-stranded mixed Œ≤-sheet. The Œ≤-sheet is flanked by 10 Œ±-helices. The apical domain is located between the first and the second strands of the central Œ≤-sheet of the protease domain. The apical domain creates a pocket that facilitates substrate binding. The C-terminal domain is an Up-Down-Up-Down four-helix bundle. The central pocket is approximately 2 nanometers in depth and opens from the extracellular space to the active site. This active site contains two zinc ions. During inhibition, each acts as a ligand to an oxygen in 2-PMPA or phosphate. There is also one calcium ion coordinated in GCPII, far from the active site. It has been proposed that calcium holds together the protease and apical domains. In addition, human GCPII has ten sites of potential glycosylation, and many of these sites (including some far from the catalytic domain) affect the ability of GCPII to hydrolyze NAAG. The FOLH1 gene has multiple potential start sites and splice forms, giving rise to differences in membrane protein structure, localization, and carboxypeptidase activity based on the parent tissue. Enzyme kinetics The hydrolysis of NAAG by GCPII obeys Michaelis‚ÄìMenten kinetics calculated the binding constant (Km) for NAAG as approximately 130 nM and the turnover constant (kcat) as approximately 4 s‚àí1. The apparent second-order rate constant is approximately 3 √ó 107 (M¬∑s)‚àí1. Role in cancer Human PSMA is highly expressed in the prostate, roughly a hundred times greater than in most other tissues. In some prostate cancers, PSMA is the second-most upregulated gene product, with an 8- to 12-fold increase over levels in noncancerous prostate cells. Because of this high expression, PSMA is being developed as potential biomarker for therapy and imaging of some cancers. In human prostate cancer, the higher expressing tumors are associated with quicker time to progression and a greater percentage of patients suffering relapse. In vitro studies using prostate and breast cancer cell lines with decreased PSMA levels showed a significant decrease in the proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion and survival of the cells.  Imaging  PSMA is the target of several nuclear medicine imaging agents for prostate cancer. PSMA expression can be imaged with a gallium-68 PSMA scan for positron emission tomography. This use is a radiolabelled small molecule that binds with high affinity to the extra- cellular domain of the PSMA receptor. Previously, an antibody targetting the intracellular domain (Indium-111 capromabpentide, marketed as Prostascint) was used, although detection rate was low. In 2020, the results of a randomised phase 3 trial (\\"ProPSMA study\\") was published comparing Gallium-68 PSMA PET/CT to standard imaging (CT and bone scan). This 300 patient study conducted at 10 study demonstrated superior accuracy of PSMA PET/CT (92% vs 65%), higher significant change in management (28% vs 15%), less equivocal/uncertain imaging findings (7% vs 23%) and lower radiation exposure (10 msV vs 19 mSv). The study concludes that PSMA PET/CT is a suitable replacement for conventional imaging, providing superior accuracy, to the combined findings of CT and bone scanning. This new technology is currently being assessed for FDA approval.  Therapeutic target (Theranostics)  PSMA can also be used experimentally to target treatment. Lutetium-177 is a beta emitter, bound to PSMA to deliver treat prostate tumours. The prospective phase II study demonstrated activity (defined by reduction in PSA of 50% or more) in 64% of men. Common toxicities include dry mouth, dry fatigue, nausea, dry eyes and thrombocytopenia (reduction in platelets). The results of randomised trials are awaited including the phase 3 VISION trial. Neurotransmitter degradation  For those studying neural based diseases, NAAG is one of the three most prevalent neurotransmitters found in the central nervous system and when it catalyzes the reaction to produce glutamate it is also producing another neurotransmitter. Glutamate is a common and abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system; however, if there is too much glutamate transmission, this can kill or at least damage neurons and has been implicated in many neurological diseases and disorders therefore the balance that NAAG peptidase contributes to is quite important.  Potential therapeutic applications = Function in the brain  GCPII has been shown to both indirectly and directly increase the concentration of glutamate in the extracellular space. GCPII directly cleaves NAAG into NAA and glutamate. NAAG has been shown, in high concentration, to indirectly inhibit the release of neutrotransmitters, such as GABA and glutamate. It does this through interaction with and activation of presynaptic group II mGluRs. Thus, in the presence of NAAG peptidase, the concentration of NAAG is kept in check, and glutamate and GABA, among other neurotransmitters, are not inhibited. Researchers have been able to show that effective and selective GCPII inhibitors are able to decrease the brain's levels of glutamate and even provide protection from apoptosis or degradation of brain neurons in many animal models of stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and neuropathic pain. This inhibition of these NAAG peptidases, sometimes referred to as NPs, are thought to provide this protection from apoptosis or degradation of brain neurons by elevating the concentrations of NAAG within the synapse of neurons. NAAG then reduces the release of glutamate while stimulating the release of some trophic factors from the glia cells in the central nervous system, resulting in the protection from apoptosis or degradation of brain neurons. It is important to note, however, that these NP inhibitors do not seem to have any effect on normal glutamate function. The NP inhibition is able to improve the naturally occurring regulation instead of activating or inhibiting receptors that would disrupt this process. Research has also shown that small- molecule-based NP inhibitors are beneficial in animal models that are relevant to neurodegenerative diseases. Some specific applications of this research include neuropathic and inflammatory pain, traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke, schizophrenia, diabetic neuropathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as drug addiction. Previous research has found that drugs that are able to reduce glutamate transmission can relieve the neuropathic pain, although the resultant side-effects have limited a great deal of their clinical applications. Therefore, it appears that, since GCPII is exclusively recruited for the purpose of providing a glutamate source in hyperglutamatergic and excitotoxic conditions, this could be an alternative to avert these side- effects. More research findings have shown that the hydrolysis of NAAG is disrupted in schizophrenia, and they have shown that specific anatomical regions of the brain may even show discrete abnormalities in the GCP II synthesis, so NPs may also be therapeutic for patients suffering with schizophrenia. One major hurdle with using many of the potent GCPII inhibitors that have been prepared to date are typically highly polar compounds, which causes problems because they do not then penetrate the blood‚Äìbrain barrier easily.  Potential uses of NAAG peptidase inhibitors  Glutamate is the ‚Äúprimary excitatory neurotransmitter in the human nervous system‚Äù, participating in a multitude of brain functions. Over-stimulation and -activation of glutamate receptors as well as ‚Äúdisturbances in the cellular mechanisms that protect against the adverse consequences of physiological glutamate receptor activation‚Äù have been known to cause neuron damage and death, which have been associated with multiple neurological diseases. Due to the range of glutamate function and presence, it has been difficult to create glutamatergic drugs that do not negatively affect other necessary functions and cause unwanted side-effects. NAAG peptidase inhibition has offered the possibility for specific drug targeting.  Specific inhibitors  Since its promise for possible neurological disease therapy and specific drug targeting, NAAG peptidase inhibitors have been widely created and studied. A few small molecule examples are those that follow: :2-PMPA and analogues :Thiol and indole thiol derivatives :Hydroxamate derivatives :Conformationally constricted dipeptide mimetics :PBDA- and urea-based inhibitors. Structures of Two Common Inhibitors: 2-PMPA and 2-MPPA Other potential therapeutic applications  Neuropathic and inflammatory pain = Pain cause by injury to CNS or PNS has been associated with increase glutamate concentration. NAAG inhibition reduced glutamate presence and could, thus, diminish pain. (Neale JH et al., 2005). Nagel et al. used the inhibitor 2-PMPA to show the analgesic effect of NAAG peptidase inhibitions. This study followed one by Chen et al., which showed similar results. = Head injury = Severe head injury (SHI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are widespread and have a tremendous impact. ‚ÄúThey are the leading cause of death in children and young adults (<25 years) and account for a quarter of all deaths in the five to 15 years age group‚Äù. Following initial impact, glutamate levels rise and cause excitotoxic damage in a process that has been well characterized. With its ability to reduce glutamate levels, NAAG inhibition has shown promise in preventing neurological damage associated with SHI and TBI. = Stroke = According to the National Stroke Association, stroke is the third-leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability. It is thought that glutamate levels cause underlying ischemic damage during a stroke, and, thus, NAAG inhibition might be able to diminish this damage. = Schizophrenia = Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that affects 1% of people throughout the world. It can be modeled by PCP in laboratory animals, and it has been shown that mGluR agonists have reduced the effects of the drug. NAAG is, such, an mGluR agonist. Thus, inhibition of the enzyme that reduces NAAG concentration, NAAG peptidase, could provide a practical treatment for reduction of schizophrenic symptoms. = Diabetic neuropathy = Diabetes can lead to damaged nerves, causing loss of sensation, pain, or, if autonomic nerves are associated, damage to the circulatory, reproductive, or digestive systems, among others. Over 60% of diabetic patients are said to have some form of neuropathy, however, the severity ranges dramatically. Neuropathy not only directly causes harm and damage but also can indirectly lead to such problems as diabetic ulcerations, which in turn can lead to amputations. In fact, over half of all lower limb amputations in the United States are of patients with diabetes. Through the use of the NAAG peptidase inhibitor 2-PMPA, NAAG cleavage was inhibited and, with it, programmed DRG neuronal cell death in the presence of high glucose levels. The researchers have proposed that the cause of this is NAAG's agonistic activity at mGluR3. In addition, NAAG also ‚Äúprevented glucose-induced inhibition of neurite growth‚Äù (Berent- Spillson, et al. 2004). Overall, this makes GCPIII inhibition a clear model target for combating diabetic neuropathy. = Drug addiction = Schizophrenia, as previously described, is normally modeled in the laboratory through a PCP animal model. As GCPIII inhibition was shown to possibly limit schizophrenic behavior in this model, this suggests that GCPIII inhibition, thus, reduces the effect of PCP. In addition, the reward action of many drugs (cocaine, PCP, alcohol, nicotine, etc.) have been shown with increasing evidence to be related to glutamate levels, on which NAAG and GCPIII can have some regulatory effect. In summary, the findings of multiple drug studies to conclude that: :NAAG/NP system might be involved in neuronal mechanisms regulating cue- induced cocaine craving, the development of cocaine seizure kindling, and management of opioid addiction and alcohol consumptive behaviour. Therefore, NP inhibitors could provide a novel therapy for such conditions. = Other diseases and disorders = NAAG inhibition has also been studied as a treatment against prostate cancer, ALS, and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.

In this seminar, mathematicians gather to discuss and explore different notions in Number Theory. The United States is one of the most invested countries in Number Theory as it holds numerous conferences with mathematicians participating from around the world and it is the country with the most Number Theory centres, the New York Number Theory Seminar being just one of them. The New York Number Theory Seminar also organizes an annual Workshop on Combinatorial and Additive Number Theory (CANT) at the CUNY Graduate Center. The seminar began in 1981 with members working for the City College (CUNY), Columbia University, and Rutgers‚ÄìNewark, and some still currently at Lehman College (CUNY) and the Polytechnic University of New York.  Proceedings  The Graduate Center, where the New York Number Theory seminars take place, is located in the former B. Altman and Company Building at 365 Fifth Avenue. The New York Number Theory Seminar originally began when Number Theorists Harvey Cohn, David and Gregory Chudnovsky and Melvyn B. Nathanson met regularly, usually on Tuesday afternoons, during the academic year at the CUNY Graduate Center of the City University of New York, at 365 Fifth Avenue between 34th and 35th Streets. The location was convenient to all parts of the city and major transportation hubs as it is located in the New York City central business district. These members were the founders of the seminar and continued to host it for many years. The Graduate Center currently holds 30 research centres and institutes, with the New York Number Theory Seminar being one of them. Information for attending the New York Number Theory seminars is available on their website. This includes the speaker for the session and the chosen topic. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, all in-person seminars at the Graduate Center CUNY), including the New York Number Theory Seminar, were temporarily suspended. No online seminars replaced the in-person seminars.  Support from third parties  The seminar is awarded support by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The NSF runs a program called the Research Training Group which the aim is to encourage more individuals to pursue a career in mathematics so that there can be more in-depth scientific research, the idea revolves around a competitiveness between mathematicians to pursue great achievements. The Research Training Group involves a variety of people with different educational background ranging from undergraduate students to postdoctoral associates. The NSF funds the Research Training Group program which supports the New York Number Theory Seminar. This support is provided directly through the universities collaborating in this seminar, those three different universities working in Number Theory: City University of New York (CUNY), University of New York (UNY) and Columbia University. These universities qualify for the help from the program as they organise the New York Number Theory seminar which is a research group in Number Theory. The New York Number Theory Seminar has also received support from the U.S. Air Force in the field of computer assisted Number Theory. The U.S. Air Force donated funds to support the New York Number Theory Seminar. They support the development of Number Theory because it contributes to expand knowledge on computer science and engineering.  Notable hosts and other collaborators of the seminar = Hosts and co-founders  The first ever meeting of the New York Number Theory seminar was held exclusively between these four individuals. The meeting was encouraged by the universities where the co-founders each worked at. The seminars expanded in the number of members by involving more mathematicians with different academic standards in Number Theory. David and Gregory Chudnovsky are two brothers who are currently distinguished professors at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering. According to The New Yorker in 1992\\"The Mountains of Pi\\"The New Yorker, Gregory Chudnovsky is one of the greatest living mathematicians in the world. He suffers from myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disease, and is followed closely by his brother David. The brothers have participated heavily in number theory with the publishing of the Chudnovsky algorithm which is still used to this very day to calculate more precisely the infinite decimals of œÄ. Their contribution to the New York Number Theory Seminar is important as they have released at least one chapter in every publication since 1982 and are recognised as editors on the front cover of all of these publications.They are also the members who work with the publishing company Springer on behalf of the other members of the seminars. Harvey Cohn was a professor of Mathematics at the City College of New York[2].Birth and career data according to American Men and Women of Science , Thomson Gale 2004 In 1948, he accomplished a PhD at Harvard University specialising in Diophantine aspects of Poincar√© Theta functions, a subset of Number Theory. The Institute for Advanced Study recognises that Harvey Cohn's main field of study was Number Theory. He has also been an active member and host of the New York Number Theory, participating in every publication whilst he was still involved. He was both a writer and an editor in the books. However, he announced his retirement from the seminar and withdrew in December 1995. He recently died in 2014. Melvyn B. Nathanson Melvyn B. Nathanson is a professor of Mathematics at Lehman college and The Graduate Center (CUNY). In 1974‚Äì1975, after his studies in mathematics and early on in his professional life, he was an assistant to the mathematician Andr√© Weil in the Institute for Advanced Study. His mentor Andr√© Weil was a specialist in the field on number theory. Melvyn B. Nathanson, often abbreviated in his work to M.B. Nathanson, released over 150 research papers and contributed either as author or editor to 20 books, counting the lecture notes released by the New York Number Theory seminars. He is considered the main host and organiser of the seminars, according to the other hosts in the group. His contributions include organising the annual Workshop on Combinatorial and Additive Number Theory, writing and editing the publications of the seminars. He is now based in the City University and continues to act as the host to the seminar.  Other collaborators  Paul Erd≈ës in 1992 Paul Erd≈ës was a renowned in the mathematics community and has published more papers in the field of mathematics than any other person, a record that still stands to this day. He was acknowledged as one of the greatest contributors to mathematics in the 20th Century. Erd≈ës has collaborated with over 500 people and he frequently worked with the main host of the seminar Melvyn B. Nathanson. Together they wrote chapters in the publications of the New York Number Theory Seminar.  Publications = General information on the publications  Proceedings of the seminar have been published regularly by Springer-Verlag, an global publishing company. David and Gregory Chudnovsky, on behalf of the other co-organisers of the seminars, contacted the publishing company who then accepted their request to publish the seminar's lecture notes in mathematics. Publications of the seminars started in 1982, a year after the seminar's foundation. To this day, Springer-Verlag continue to publish the proceedings of the seminar. They can be found on their website and on other platforms such as Amazon. Specifically for the publications of the entire lecture notes in Mathematics series, there were two editors: Beno Eckmann and Albrecht Dold who did not participate in the seminars or present any ideas. However, they contributed to shaping and defining the Editorial Policy of the series. Different editions of the lecture notes from the seminars are available worldwide, both online and as a hard copy. These lecture notes can be used as references during other seminar proceedings.  Different editions  The very first publications of the New York Number Theory seminar appeared in a series called ‚ÄúLecture Notes in Mathematics‚Äù. The series holds a total of four different editions starting in 1982 and finishing in 1988. The first edition to be released was published in 1982 and presents 11 different articles. It is the very first edition ever to be published by the New York Number Theory Seminar. The second edition in the series was published in 1984 and corresponds to the lecture notes of the seminars during the years 1983 and part of 1984. The edition also holds 11 different articles. The third edition was published in 1985. The work undergone during the seminars has recognised the support of the NSF and the U.S. Air Force on the introduction page of the edition. They also acknowledge the help of the Computer Algebra Group of the T.J. Watson Research Center who contributed with extended research and provided knowledge on certain topics. This edition holds the lectures notes of the remaining seminars of 1984 (those which have not already been published in the previous edition) and part of 1985. There is a total of 16 articles in this edition with P. Erdos having contributed to 2 of them (Problems and Results on Minimal Bases in Additive Number Theory and On the Number of False Witnesses for a Composite Number). The last edition was published in 1988. It is the edition that holds the work of the most seminars in this series as it holds the records of the lectures notes of the rest of 1985 and the whole of the years 1986, 1987 and 1988. After the series ‚ÄúLecture Notes in Mathematics‚Äù, the volumes are all published separately. They appear under the name ‚ÄúNumber Theory‚Äù and the names of the editors of the volumes appear on the cover. The first separately published volume is the fifth volume of papers presented at the New York Number Theory Seminar covering the lecture notes from the seminars in the years 1989 and 1990. There is a total of 13 different articles. The next volume was published in 1995. It is the sixth volume of papers presented at the New York Number Theory Seminar. This volume is dedicated to Harvey Cohn who was one of the main organisers of the seminar who actively participated from 1982 to 1995, as stated above. He retired in December 1995, thus making this volume his last contribution to the New York Number Theory seminar. This volume covers the work of the seminars from the years 1991 to early 1995 with a total of 22 different articles. The seventh volume was published in 2003 and covers the work of the years 1995 to 2003. There is a total of 16 different articles. The latest volume published by the New York Number Theory seminar is entitled the \\"Combinatorial and Additive Number Theory III\\" published in 2020. It concerns the lecture notes of the seminars of the years 2017 and 2018. The only remaining co-founder is Melvyn B. Nathanson who is also the editor of this volume.

Raised in Natick, Massachusetts, Miller played university hockey with the University of New Hampshire Wildcats of the NCAA. He was selected by the Quebec Nordiques in the fourth round, 66th overall in the 1980 NHL entry draft. Miller never got a chance to show his skills with the Quebec Nordiques, spending a few seasons with a handful of American and International Hockey League teams. In 1985, the 6'2\\" left winger signed as a free agent with the Boston Bruins and made the team that year as their enforcer. In the 1985-86 season he played in 46 games and collected 178 penalty minutes. During his stint with the Boston Bruins, Miller was known for his many fights with John Kordic. His role continued to expand with the Boston Bruins, playing in 78 games during the 1987-88 regular season and racking up 304 penalty minutes - both career highs. That year in the playoffs, Miller was a regular on the Bruins' squad playing in 12 games and picking up 124 minutes in penalties. In January 1989 he was traded from Boston Bruins to the Los Angeles Kings for future considerations. Miller played four more seasons with the LA Kings, in the role of enforcer on a team that included Wayne Gretzky. He retired from professional hockey in 1992, having played 446 career NHL regular season games with 1723 penalty minutes.

A 6'-3\\", 220 lbs. tight end from the University of Iowa, Reichow was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the fourth round of the 1956 NFL Draft. He was one of two Minnesota Vikings (along with Hugh McElhenny) selected to the Pro Bowl after their inaugural 1961 season. An All-Big Ten quarterback, Reichow starred at Iowa. He was the football team's MVP as a senior and left school as its all-time leader in total offense. The Detroit Lions took notice and selected Reichow, who also played in the 1955 basketball Final Four for Iowa, in the fourth round. Reichow contributed to the Lions‚Äô 1957 NFL title as a receiver and back-up quarterback for Tobin Rote, whom replaced the injured Bobby Layne as starting quarterback. Reichow would see relief duty at quarterback in the 1957 NFL Championship Game, when Rote left the game with the Lions leading 52-14. Three years later, Reichow was a member of the Eagles‚Äô 1960 championship club. On July 24, 1960, (Walt Kowalczyk) was traded to the Detroit Lions in exchange for Jerry Reichow.[1] Reichow joined former teammate Norm Van Brocklin who became the Minnesota Vikings first head coach where he was key to quarterback Fran Tarkenton‚Äôs success in 1961. Reichow played wide receiver and proved to be the rookie‚Äôs favorite target, catching 50 passes for 859 yards and 11 touchdowns. (Reichow‚Äôs 11 TD receptions stood 34 years as a single-season team record until broken by Cris Carter in 1995.) No. 89 followed his Pro Bowl season with 39 receptions before moving to tight end his final years in purple. Known as ‚ÄúOld Reliable‚Äù and considered one of the team's toughest players, Reichow caught a combined 55 passes from his new position in 1963-64. At the age of 31, and with the team stockpiling young receivers, Reichow's playing career ended when Van Brocklin cut the highly respected veteran during the 1965 training camp and gave him a job scouting for the club. Reichow's opinions and keen eye for talent have helped shaped the Vikings for the majority of their 56 years. The former wide receiver and tight end has served in a variety of personnel roles during his five decades of dedication to the franchise. From scout to Director of Player Personnel to Director of Football Operations to Assistant General Manager for National Scouting to his current consultant role, which he assumed a few years ago, Reichow is one of the longest-serving employees in the NFL. His longevity and success in the fickle ‚ÄúNot For Long‚Äù league is all the more impressive considering his background when entering the personnel department in 1965. Jerry Reichow currently resides in Santa Fe, NM with his wife Carolyn Reichow. References 1) \\"Leading Everybody Happy with Lions Deal\\".

In Paris, she initially has trouble finding work, and spends one evening without shelter. She eventually gets a job waitressing in a small caf√©, the Bar des Th√©√¢tres, even though the caf√©, following tradition, has never before hired female waiters. The owner hires Jessica only because he is expecting large crowds soon and needs staff. The caf√© is in an area of Paris close to several artistic venues, including the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es and a concert hall, on Avenue Montaigne. One of the backstage staff at the theatre, Claudie, helps to welcome Jessica to Paris. While working at the caf√©, Jessica meets a number of people who are all dealing with various life crises or changes: * Catherine is an actress who has been type-cast by her role in a popular TV soap opera and who yearns to do more artistically rewarding work. She is alternating between her TV soap opera and a production of a Georges Feydeau play, rarely getting time for sleep except in taxicabs. A new opportunity arises when the American film director Brian Sobinski arrives in Paris to cast a new film based on the life of Simone de Beauvoir. * Jean-Fran√ßois is a world-renowned pianist who wants nothing more than to share his playing with those who would appreciate it least, and to get away from formal classical music concerts. This disconcerts his wife Valentine, who is also his manager, because of all the planning that she has done for his career. * Jacques is an art collector who has decided to sell off his collection towards the end of his life. He and his son Fr√©d√©ric have a somewhat strained relationship, not helped by the fact that Jacques is in a relationship with the much younger Val√©rie, with whom Fr√©d√©ric himself once had an affair. Fr√©d√©ric is also just separated from his wife. All three face pivotal turning points in their lives on the same night, with Jessica as a thread between all three. Classical music reference The French pianist Fran√ßois-Ren√© Duch√¢ble was the classical music technical advisor for the film, and performs the solo piano works for the soundtrack. The character of Jean-Fran√ßois Lefort in this film incorporates elements of Duch√¢ble's own expressed attitudes towards the classical music world. In the film, Jean-Fran√ßois states his dislike for the stresses and formality of the classical music world, and wants to perform concerts for children and the ill. This is reflected from public statements that Duch√¢ble had made in previous years.

These programs go under various names, including early access, special access, or managed access program, compassionate use, compassionate access, named-patient access, temporary authorization for use, cohort access, and pre-approval access. In general the person and his or her doctor must apply for access to the investigational product, the company has to choose to cooperate, and the medicines regulatory agency needs to agree that the risks and possible benefits of the drug or device are understood well enough to determine if putting the person at risk has sufficient potential benefit. In some countries the government will pay for the drug or device, but in many countries the person must pay for the drug or device, as well as medical services necessary to receive it. In the US, compassionate use started with the provision of investigational medicine to certain patients in the late 1970s, and a formal program was established in 1987 in response to HIV/AIDS patients requesting access to drugs in development. An important legal case was Abigail Alliance v. von Eschenbach, in which the Abigail Alliance, a group that advocates for access to investigational drugs for people who are terminally ill, tried to establish such access as a legal right. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case, effectively upholding previous cases that have maintained that there is not a constitutional right to unapproved medical products. Programs As of 2016, regulation of access to pharmaceuticals that were not approved for marketing was handled on a country by country basis, including in the European Union, where the European Medicines Agency issued guidelines for national regulatory agencies to follow. In the US, Europe, and the EU, no company could be compelled to provide a drug or device that it was developing. Companies sometimes provide drugs under these programs to people who were in clinical trials and who responded to the drug, after the clinical trial ends. United States In the US as of 2018, people could try obtain unapproved drugs or medical devices that were in development under specific conditions. These conditions were: * The person wanting the drug or device and a licensed physician are both willing to participate. * The person's physician determines that there is no comparable or satisfactory therapy available to diagnose, monitor, or treat the patient's disease or condition. * That the probable risk to the person from the investigational product is not greater than the probable risk from the disease or condition. * The FDA determines that there is sufficient evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product to support its use in the particular circumstance; * The FDA determines that providing the investigational product will not interfere with the initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations to support marketing approval; * The sponsor (generally the company developing the investigational product for commercial use) or the clinical investigator (or the patient's physician in the case of a single patient expanded access request) submits a clinical protocol (a document that describes the treatment plan for the patient) that is consistent with FDA's statute and applicable regulations for INDs or investigational device exemption applications (IDEs), describing the use of the investigational product; and * The person is unable to obtain the investigational drug or device under another IND application (for drugs), IDE application (for devices), or to participate in a clinical trial. Drugs can be made available to individuals, small groups, or large groups. In the US, actual provision of the drug depends on the manufacturer's willingness to provide it, as well as the person's ability to pay for it; it is the company's decision whether to require payment or to provide the drug or device for free. The manufacturer can only charge direct costs for individual INDs; it can add some but not all indirect costs for small group or larger expanded access programs. To the extent that a doctor or clinic is required for use of the drug or device, they too may require payment. In some cases, it may be in the manufacturer's commercial interest to provide access under an EA program; this is a way, for example, for a company to make money before the drug or device is approved. Companies must provide data collected from people getting the drug or device under EA programs to the FDA annually; this data may be helpful with regard to getting the drug or device approved, or may be harmful, should unexpected adverse events occur. The manufacturer remains legally liable as well. If the manufacturer chooses to charge for the investigational product, that price influences later discussions about the price if the product is approved for marketing. =State law= , 41 states have passed right-to-try laws that permit manufacturers to provide experimental medicines to terminally ill people without US FDA authorization. Legal, medical, and bioethics scholars, including Jonathan Darrow and Arthur Caplan, have argued that these state laws have little practical significance because people can already obtain pre-approval access through the FDA's expanded access program, and because the FDA is generally not the limiting factor in obtaining pre-approval access. Europe In Europe, the European Medicines Agency issued guidelines that members may follow. Each country has its own regulations, and they vary. In the UK, for example, the program is called \\"early access to medicine scheme\\" or EAMS and was established in 2014. If a company that wants to provide a drug under EAMS, it must submit its Phase I data to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and apply for what is called a \\"promising innovative medicine\\" (PIM) designation. If that designation is approved, the data is reviewed, if that review is positive, the National Health Service is obligated to pay for people who fit the criteria to have access to the drug. As of 2016, governments also paid for early access to drugs in Austria, Germany, Greece, and Spain. Companies sometimes make use of expanded programs in Europe even after they receive EMA approval to market a drug, because drugs also must go through regulatory processes in each member state, and in some countries this process can take nearly a year; companies can start making sales earlier under these programs. History Medicinal cannabis farmed by the University of Mississippi for the government In the US, one of the earliest expanded access programs was a compassionate use IND that was established in 1978, which allowed a limited number of people to use medical cannabis grown at the University of Mississippi. It is administered by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The program was started after Robert C. Randall brought a lawsuit (Randall v. U.S) against the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Health, Education & Welfare. Randall, who had glaucoma, had successfully used the Common Law doctrine of necessity to argue against criminal charges of marijuana cultivation that had been brought against him, because his use of cannabis was deemed a medical necessity (U.S. v. Randall). On November 24, 1976, federal Judge James Washington ruled in his favor.The Criminal Law Reporter. 20. Bureau of National Affairs. Arlington, Va. 1976. p. 2300. The settlement in Randall v. U.S. became the legal basis for the FDA's compassionate IND program. People were only allowed to use cannabis under the program who had certain conditions, like glaucoma, known to be alleviated with cannabis. The scope was later expanded to include people with AIDS in the mid-1980s. At its peak, fifteen people received the drug. 43 people were approved for the program, but 28 of the people whose doctors completed the necessary paperwork never received any cannabis. The program stopped accepting new people in 1992 after public health authorities concluded there was no scientific value to it, and due to President George H.W. Bush administration's policies. As of 2011, four people continued to receive cannabis from the government under the program. The closure of the program during the height of the AIDS epidemic led to the formation of the medical cannabis movement in the United States, a movement which initially sought to provide cannabis for treating anorexia and wasting syndrome in people with AIDS. In November 2001 the Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs was established by Frank Burroughs in memory of his daughter, Abigail. The Alliance seeks broader availability of investigational drugs on behalf of people with terminal illnesses. It is best known for a legal case, which it lost, Abigail Alliance v. von Eschenbach, in which it was represented by the Washington Legal Foundation. On August 7, 2007, in an 8‚Äì2 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed an earlier ruling in favor of the Alliance. In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear their appeal. This decision left standing the appellate court decision that people who are terminal ill patients have no legal right to demand \\"a potentially toxic drug with no proven therapeutic benefit\\". In March 2014, Josh Hardy, a 7-year-old boy from Virginia, made national headlines that sparked a conversation on pediatric access to investigational drugs when his family's request for brincidofovir was declined by the drug manufacturer, Chimerix. The company reversed its decision after pressure from cancer advocacy organizations, and Josh received the drug that saved his life. In 2016 Kids v Cancer, a pediatric cancer advocacy organization, launched the Compassionate Use Navigator to assist physicians and guide families about the application process. Since then, FDA simplified the application process, but stressed that it cannot require a manufacturer to provide a product. FDA receives about 1,500 expanded access requests per year and authorizes 99% of it.

He also spent ten seasons in the Eastern Amateur Hockey League, the Pacific Coast Hockey League, and the American Hockey League. During his NHL career he was one of only three Americans in the league. In his only NHL playoff game he fractured two vertebrae after throwing a check. He was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1974. Playing career Moe began his career playing for the Atlantic City Sea Gulls in the Eastern Amateur Hockey League (EAHL). After playing 34 games for the Gulls he was traded to the Baltimore Orioles in January 1940, for Ed Powers. He finished the season with 6 goals and 11 points between the two clubs. Moe played one more season with the Orioles, matching his goal production and increasing his points to 12. He then moved on to play with the Philadelphia Ramblers in the American Hockey League (AHL). Moe \\"excelled\\" in the AHL and posted 24 points in his lone season in Philadelphia. Following season's end Moe changed teams again this time joining the AHL's Hershey Bears. Moe's production dipped in his first year with Hershey, but in his second he finished with his AHL career high 31 points. In the off-season he was named to the AHL First All-Star Team, and his rights were traded to the National Hockey League's New York Rangers. Moe made his NHL debut on November 26, 1944 against the Boston Bruins. He played 35 games for the Rangers in the 1944-45 season while also playing 12 games for the Bears. When Moe entered the NHL he became one of only three Americans playing in the league, Frank Brimsek and John Mariucci were the other two. Midway through the following season Moe was accused of delivering an illegal low hit to the Chicago Black Hawks' Bill Mosienko which resulted in a torn knee ligament. Rangers' head coach, Frank Boucher, defended Moe by saying \\"Bill [Moe] stopped Mosienko with a fair bodycheck and bodychecking is part of a defenseman's job.\\" Moe finished the season with four goals and eight points, as the Rangers finished last for the fourth straight year. He continued to improve, increasing his point total over the next two season first to 14 then to 16, and the Rangers made the playoffs for the first time in six seasons during the 1947‚Äì48 season. In his NHL playoff debut, on March 24, 1948 against the Detroit Red Wings, Moe fractured two vertebrae after throwing a check at Bill Quackenbush. It was the only NHL playoff game that he played in. Prior to the start of the next season Moe was involved in an automobile accident with four of his teammates, as they were retiring from exhibition games in Quebec. He suffered two scalp wounds, requiring 24 stitches to close, and a mild concussion. Despite the injuries, Moe played in a career best 60 games registering 9 assists along with an NHL career high 60 penalty minutes. During the off-season the Rangers traded Moe, along with the rights to Lorne Ferguson and future considerations to the Bruins for Pat Egan and cash. The Bruins acquired Moe to play for the Bears who were now their farm team. Moe played two more seasons with the Bears, registering a total of 5 goals and 37 points. After his two seasons in Hershey, Moe moved to the Pacific Coast Hockey League playing for the Calgary Stampeders. He played only one season in Calgary before returning to the EAHL, finishing his career with the Troy Uncle Sam Trojans. Moe retired at the end of the year and in his final professional season he recorded a career high 35 points. In 1974 Moe was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame.

Early life Mouly was born in Paris, France, on February 6, 1918. His interest in art developed in grade school. Mouly was first sent to drawing class as a form of punishment. At age 13 he left school to work, first as a beach vendor, then as an apprentice to a local dentist and later for a wine merchant delivering heavy baskets of wine. In 1935, while still employed by the wine merchant, Mouly began taking night classes in the arts at French Academies, the Cours Montparnasse 80, where he remained until he served in military duty during the Second World War beginning in 1938. After France fell to Germany in June 1940, Mouly became a civilian again, and earned a living working odd jobs. Mouly befriended an artist named Bernard la Fourcade, and the two established a studio in Auteuil. During a trip to Normandy in 1942, they were stopped by German officials and questioned for their lack of travel documentation, which was then required by the Vichy government. Mouly and la Fourcade were arrested shortly after their return to Paris, and mistakenly imprisoned as spies. During his solitary confinement, Mouly solidified his plans to become an artist. Career Shortly after being released from prison, Mouly, along with fellow artist √âdouard Pignon, rented the Boulogne studio of famed modernist sculptor Jacques Lipchitz (1891‚Äì1973). Mouly learned from Lipchitz, particularly about the style of cubism. By the mid-1940s, Mouly's art began to gain notoriety from his peers and collectors. In 1945, his paintings were exhibited alongside the paintings of Matisse in the Salon d'Automne in Paris. The following year he moved to La Ruche where he became friends with Picasso, Chagall, and Klein, and exhibited at the Salon du Mai. Mouly's first one-person exhibition was held in 1949 at the Libraire Bergamasque. Mouly's style was influenced by the deep, bold colors typically used in Matisse's fauvist works, and by the cubism of Picasso. Beginning in the mid-1950s, Mouly created many lithographs.

Origins He was the elder son of Peter Burke of Elm Hall, Tipperary,http://landedestates.nuigalway.ie/LandedEstates/jsp/estate- show.jsp?id=3513 by his first wife, Anne, daughter and coheiress of Matthew Dowdall, M.D., of Mullingar. In accordance with a family arrangement, his younger brother Joseph succeeded to the estate at the father's death on 13 January 1836. The Burke family were descendants of the Earl of Clanricarde via Dominick Burke (born 1664), of Clondagoff Castle, County Galway.

Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd, 'Burke of Auberies' pedigreeBurke's Peerage website, Company section, Founder page URL= http://burkespeerage.com/company_founder.php Date accessed= 4 May 2018 Career John Burke early engaged in literary work in London, but afterwards devoted himself to genealogical studies, and in 1826 he issued a Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the United Kingdom. For the first time such a work was arranged alphabetically, as opposed to in the Ahnentafel or genealogical-table style, and peers and baronets were treated together. The convenience of its method at once gave it great popularity. The Peerage was republished at irregular intervals until 1847, when it reached its ninth edition. From that date it has been issued annually. A General and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerages of England, Ireland, and Scotland, extinct, dormant, and in abeyance, was first published by Burke in 1831 (3rd edit. 1846); later editions, prepared by Sir J. B. Burke, appealed in 1866 and 1883. In 1831 Burke also issued what was intended to be the first of a series of annual handbooks, entitled The Official Calendar for 1831, but the series was not continued. Between 1833 and 1838, he published A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland, in four volumes; another edition was issued in 1838; and a third edition in two volumes between 1843 and 1849. The title was altered in the later editions to A Dictionary of the Landed Gentry and a supplementary volume appeared in 1844, containing corrigenda and a general index. It is known colloquially as Burke's Landed Gentry. Burke was also the author of: * The Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Females, including Beauties of the Courts of George IV and William IV, 2 vols. 1833The portrait gallery of distinguished females including beauties of the courts of George IV and William IV with memoirs, John Burke (ed. E. Bull, 1833) * A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Extinct and Dormant Baronetcies of England; 1838 (re-issued 1841 and 1844) * The Knightage of Great Britain and Ireland, 1841 * A General Armory of England, Scotland, and Ireland, 1842 (republished in Bohn's series in 1844 as Burke's Encyclopedia of Heraldry, and by Sir J.

Burke was also the editor of a short-lived periodical, The Patrician. Marriage and progeny He married his cousin Mary O'Reilly (died 1846), second daughter of Bernard O'Reilly of Ballymorris, Longford, Ireland. Mary is listed as one of the lost graves on the Burdett Coutts memorial in Old St. Pancras Churchyard.

A European Foundation would have been legally recognised in all European Union member states, and would have operated under the same set of conditions across the European Union.  Purpose  Proponents of a European Foundation statute pointed out that foundations and their funders are increasingly working across borders, but that a number of legal and administrative barriers are hampering new foundation initiatives in Europe and the current work of existing foundations. The statute was proposed to offer an appropriate legal tool to perform and increase foundations work and operations across Europe, while reducing costly administrative burden. Status On 8 February 2012, the European Commission presented a proposal on a European Foundation Statute.http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/company/eufoundation/index_en.htm This proposal has been shared with the Council of Ministers representing the governments of the 27 member states for review and approval, as well as to the European Parliament for its consent. The European Parliament pledged support to European statutes for foundations, as well as associations and mutual societies, with the signatures by a majority of its members of a written declaration in February 2011. The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), the EU's official advisory body on social and economic matters, passed an opinion backing the statute, drafted by Mall Hellam, by a large majority on 28 April 2010. The campaign to implement the European Foundation Statute was led by the European Foundation Centre and the Donors and Foundations Networks in Europe (DAFNE). In January 2015, the Commission confirmed its withdrawal of the legislative proposal for the European Foundation Statute in its 2015 work programme following its failure to pass through COREPER 1.

The Dames Blanches were reported in the region of Lorraine (Lotharingen) and Normandy. They appear (as Damas blancas, in Occitan), in the Pyrenees mountains, where they were supposed to appear near caves and caverns. Thomas Keightley (1870) describes the Dames Blanches as a type of F√©e known in Normandy \\"who are of a less benevolent character.\\" They lurk in narrow places such as ravines, fords, and on bridges, and try to attract passerby attention. They may require one to join in her dance or assist her in order to pass. If assisted she \\"makes him many courtesies, and then vanishes.\\" One such Dame was known as La Dame d'Apringy who appeared in a ravine at the Rue Quentin at Bayeux in Normandy, where one must dance with her a few rounds to pass. Those who refused were thrown into the thistles and briar, while those who danced were not harmed. Another Dame was known on a narrow bridge in the district of Falaise, named the Pont d'Angot. She only allowed people to pass if they went on their knees to her. Anyone who refused was tormented by the lutins, cats, owls, and other creatures who helped her.Keightley 1870. Origins J. A. MacCulloch believes Dames Blanches are one of the recharacterizations of pre-Christian female goddesses, and suggested their name Dame may have derived from the ancient guardian goddesses known as the Matres, by looking at old inscriptions to guardian goddesses, specifically inscriptions to \\"the Domin√¶, who watched over the home, perhaps became the Dames of medi√¶val folk-lore.\\"MacCulloch 1911:46-47. The Dames Blanches have close counterparts in both name and characterization in neighboring northern countries: In Germany the Weisse Frauen and in the Dutch Low Countries the Witte Wieven.

Masters used the pseudonym \\"Robert Walters\\" when he directed his early films, which include Greek Lightning. when he founded Nova Studios. He later shuttered Nova Studio and became head of production at Catalina Video. In 1992, he co-founded gay adult film studio Studio 2000. In 2006, Masters sold Studio 2000 to former Falcon Entertainment consultant David McKay. Early years Masters grew up in Illinois, and later attended college.Douglas, \\"Behind the Camera: Scott Masters, Part 2,\\" Manshots, November 1997. Masters came to San Francisco, California, from Chicago in 1966. Many of the bookstores (including gay and adult bookstores) which he visited were openly selling gay pornography. He established a small business purchasing gay pornographic magazines for area booksellers. He began selling nude male photosets from such notable photographers of the male nude as Bruce Bellas (\\"Bruce of L.A.\\"), as well as softcore nude films from Athletic Model Guild.Douglas, \\"Behind the Camera: Scott Masters, Part 1,\\" Manshots, November 1997. In late 1967, he formed a partnership with Reuben Sturman to print and distribute one-off magazines featuring the work of Kundzicz. The first magazine was Champions All, published in the spring of 1968. Moving full-time to San Francisco from Chicago, Masters took up work as a full-time bookkeeper at a printing company. He began taking photographs of nude men on the side to supply his magazines with images. Although the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that images of the male nude were not obscene in MANual Enterprises v. Day 370 U.S. 478 in 1962, U.S. postal inspectors still considered the tumescent and erect penis obscene under then-current interpretations of American federal postal and obscenity law and court rulings.Waugh, Hard to Imagine, 1996; Barron and Dienes, First Amendment Law, 1993. Nevertheless, Masters took hardcore as well as softcore images, and images of solo, duo and group sex. In 1969, Masters began producing hardcore gay male nude magazines. The Supreme Court had further liberalized the standards for obscenity in Redrup v. New York, 386 U.S. 767 (1967), and several lower-court rulings had significantly undercut the ability of state and federal authorities to seize even materials which depicted hardcore sexual activity between individuals of the same gender. The first such magazine was Hard?. By the end of the year, Masters was producing as many as six magazines a month.In all, Masters would produce more than 500 softcore and hardcore gay pornographic magazines, including 24 issues of In Touch for Men. See: Hardesty, \\"Nova Studios, Part One: The Pre-Sound Years,\\" Manshots, July 1997. In 1970, Masters produced his first film, Drilled Deep. It was a \\"loop\\" (an 8mm Short film, roughly 200 feet in length, designed to run over and over in peep shows). To distribute his hardcore films, Masters established his first adult film studio, named The Stephens Agency. Masters closed the distribution business in 1972 because it was unprofitable. That same year, Masters was prosecuted in Texas for obscenity. He pleaded guilty. He received a one-year suspended sentence, three years of probation, and a fine. After his sentencing, Masters cut back on the number of brochures, magazines and loops he produced but did not exit the adult film industry. By 1976, however, Masters had directed more than 100 loops.Hardesty, \\"Nova Studios, Part One: The Pre-Sound Years,\\" Manshots, July 1997. Feature film career In 1973, Master directed his first feature-length hardcore gay adult film which starred zarni warry. The film was Greek Lightning, produced for Jaguar Productions and starring gay porn star Jimmy Hughes.Douglas, Jerry. \\"Gay Film Heritage: Jaguar Productions, Part 1,\\" Manshots, June 1996. Using guerrilla filmmaking techniques, Masters produced one of the best-selling gay adult films of the 1970s: :We did some rather audacious things. We shot on top of a train in Train Town in Griffith Park without a permit, while one of us was given one of the guards money and another of us was talking to another guard, just so we could get the shots finished. We knew we couldn't be there long. All we had to do was do our legerdemain for five or ten minutes and be out of there. And we certainly couldn't pay for it.Douglas, \\"Behind the Camera: Scott Masters, Part 1,\\" Manshots, November 1997, p. 13. Masters heartily disliked that sort of filmmaking process. Jaguar Productions later heavily edited the film, angering Masters so much that he vowed not to make another film. In late 1973, Masters founded In Touch (now known as In Touch for Men), a softcore gay porn magazine. But after two years, Masters turned over management of the magazine to a third party (while retaining ownership). Nova Studios In 1976, Masters (still using the name Robert Walters) founded Nova Studios, distributing films through direct mail as well as adult bookstores. The studio's first production was Tubtricks. Masters doubled the length of Nova Studios' loops to more than 400 feet, extending each film's running time to nearly 20 minutes. Masters followed up with a series of long loops: Kept After School, Beached, Tricking, Hot Lunch, Jocks, That Boy Next Door and Down on the Farm. Masters attempted to keep Nova Studios afloat by finally producing sound films. In 1981, Masters bowed to public demand for sound film and financial pressures and produced It's the Life. Filming went so poorly that Masters eventually shot most of the film without sound. Masters would not finally produce a sound film until 1983. But in the intervening two years, Nova Studios lost critical market share.Hardesty, \\"Nova Studios, Part Two: The Final Years,\\" Manshots, August 1997 Masters began dubbing older silent loops in 1981 as well. He added music, some narration, and asynchronous sexual sounds to the films and began re-releasing these to make money. In 1984, Masters hired Chet Thomas as an editor, and Thomas worked on several of Nova Studios' final films. Nova Studios ceased to make gay adult films in late 1986. Catalina years In 1987, Masters was hired as head of production for Catalina Video. William Higgins had founded Catalina in 1978. Catalina Video had been distributing Nova Studios' films to adult bookstores and video stores since about 1982. With Nova Studios in financial distress, Higgins and Masters struck a deal: Catalina would purchase the rights to the unreleased Boys Town. Masters would be free to sell the rights to all his other films to another vendor. Catalina would also hire Masters as its head of production, where he would also be free to write and direct films on an occasional basis. Masters sold the rights to nearly all of Nova Studios' films to L.A. Video. Unfortunately, L.A. Video would go bankrupt a few years later, leaving the rights to all of Nova Studios' products in legal limbo. Given the transition in his life, the director stopped using the name \\"Robert Walters\\" and adopted his new stage name, Scott Masters. Masters' first film for Catalina was The Bigger They Come (1987). For the first time, Masters made a film on a set in a studio rather than on location. He followed it up with Down for the Count, a film which featured the debut of popular star Jon Vincent. Once at Catalina, Masters also hired Chet Thomas, his former editor at Nova Studios. During his time at Catalina, Masters also became good friends with director John Travis. Travis had been working for Brentwood Studios and Falcon Studios since the early 1970s. In 1988, Masters hired him away from Falcon. The first film Travis helmed under Masters' supervision was My Best Buddy (1988). Masters is also partly responsible for the career of gay adult film director Chi Chi LaRue. LaRue had come to California in 1987 and gotten a job in Catalina's sales department. He had been promoted to the promotions department, and sought a directing job. Masters, however, refused to give him one. LaRue left Catalina in 1989, moving to InHand Productions and Vivid Video. Catalina president Mike Merrick left and new studio head Christian Mann took over. Mann rehired LaRue, and put him to work on his first film, Billboard (starring Joey Stefano). LaRue credits Masters with forcing him to learn more about directing, which led to his eventual directorial career.LaRue, Making It Big, 1997. The change in management at Catalina led Masters to significantly cut back on his duties. While he still managed productions, he became far less involved in casting decisions. When Merrick eventually purchased Catalina from Higgins, Masters decided to leave the studio. Studio 2000 In 1992, Masters left Catalina. John Travis, too, had left Catalina after a contract dispute and began using the name \\"John Trennel.\\"Adam Film World 1993 Directory to Gay Adult Video, February 1993. The two directors co-founded Studio 2000 in late 1992. Masters announced his retirement in 1999. But he quickly returned to making adult film. He and John Travis found and hired Czech photographer Jan Novak to produce Studio 2000 International line with European talents. During the 14 years in which Masters co-owned Studio 2000, the studio won numerous awards at the Grabbys, Gay Erotic Video Awards, and GayVN Awards. In April 2006, Masters and Travis sold Studio 2000 to former Falcon Entertainment consultant David McKay.Lawrence, \\"J.C. Adams New Production Chief at Studio 2000,\\" Adult Video News, July 2006.

His courtesy name was Zhenfu (Ë¥ûÁà∂, ‚ÄúTrue Father‚Äù) and his pen name was Yuyong Jushi (ÂØìÂ∫∏Â±ÖÂ£´, ‚ÄúRefined Scholar Dwelling in Simplicity‚Äù). Huang was a native of the cultural mecca Hangzhou. In 1598, he passed his Jinshi examination and held an official post in Jiangxi. His calligraphy style combined the manner of two Song Dynasty masters, Su Shi and Mi Fei. Huang‚Äôs best known calligraphy was, in his lifetime, reproduced in the Ming period painting-calligraphy album Tangshi Huapu (ÂîêËØóÁîªË∞±, \\"Paintings of Tang Period Poems\\"), which itself was copied onto additional paintings. As was common in the Ming period, Huang perhaps did multiple versions of this Tang period poem by Liu Changqing (ÂäâÈï∑Âçø) and others. His calligraphy was certainly sought after during his lifetime and in the period right after his death. Huang was also something of a poet. Examples of his verse can be found in various collections. A photo of a surviving example in Japan of his Liu Changqing poem is reproduced here. The poem reads: Seeking Out Zen Master LanjoComplete Tang Poems, vol. 5, p. 1557 > Autumn grasses and yellow flowers cover the ancient path; > In the glade beyond, from where does someone‚Äôs smoke come? > Only the mountain monk has grown old in the hills; > Just the cold pines have seen anyone young.

Its aim is to fund projects in research and scholarship, arts and culture, as well as education and training. It was founded in 1971 by Gerd Bucerius and carries the name of the founder, the title of the weekly newspaper Die Zeit, which he co-founded, and the nickname of his second wife, Gertrud Ebel, Ebelin.  Early projects of the founder  The first scholarships in the 1970s were awarded to young journalists, to enable them to study at Harvard University in Cambridge/US as part of the ZEIT Fellowship programme. In the 1980s, Gerd Bucerius began to actively support stronger competitiveness in higher education in Germany, and gave substantial funds to the private University Witten/Herdecke. In order to promote Hamburg's literary scene, the foundation acquired a villa on the Outer Alster Lake. The Literaturhaus Hamburg opened in 1989, and since then the foundation has made the venue available rent free to the City of Hamburg and the organization Literaturhaus-Verein. In the 1990s, the foundation increased its investments in academia and set up the Gerd Bucerius-Juraprogramm a scholarship programme for young lawyers. Until the death of Gerd Bucerius, the foundation funded 90 individual projects with a total of 15 million euros. Upon the deaths of the founder in 1995 and of his wife in 1997, the couples' entire private assets were bequeathed to the foundation. Over the past ten years, the foundation has provided a total of 153 million euros in grants.  Organization  The statutory organs consist of a Board of Directors and a Board of Trustees. Following the death of the founder, Michael G√∂ring was appointed Executive Director in 1997; he has been President of the Board since 2005.https://www.zeit-stiftung.de/stiftung/mitarbeiter/ Michael Berndt has been Financial Director since 2010. Since 1995, Manfred Lahnstein has acted as Chairman of the Board of Trustees.  Mission statement  The mission statement of the foundation opens with the following words: 'Civil society is called upon to find solutions to the many challenges in the present and future. In the tradition of its founders, Ebelin and Gerd Bucerius, the Zeit- Stiftung is part of the liberal and cosmopolitan civil society it wishes to promote.'  Conditions for grants  The foundation focuses on funding projects that it has initiated, but also gives grants to outside applicants, preferably in Hamburg, and provided they fit the aims and criteria for funding. In 2015 the foundation was able to dispose of revenues of 22.3 million euros. As one of the largest privately funded foundations in Germany with assets of von 771 million euros (end of financial year 2015), the Zeit- Stiftung has been able to establish institutions of its own. A large part of the annual budget is allocated to the independent institutions Bucerius Law School and Bucerius Kunst Forum.  Projects (overview)= Research and scholarship  Bucerius Law School in Hamburg was established in 2000 and has since then been funded solely by the foundation as a private law school. Furthermore, the Zeit-Stiftung aims to provide funding and grants to 'young, gifted, international researchers engaged in interdisciplinary studies'. The foundation also supports projects in the humanities and social sciences with a focus on Hamburg and Haifa.  Arts and culture  With its own exhibition space, the Bucerius Kunst Forum established in 2002, the foundation supports the Stiftung Hamburger Museen (foundation of Hamburg museums), especially projects aimed at archiving and presenting their collections. Other aims are to promote 'the diversity of cultural forms of communication and presentation in music, literature, and theatre'. Conservation projects in North and East Germany are also part of the foundation's activities.  Education and training  A central aim of the foundation is to 'promote equal opportunities in education', especially during transitions from international reception classes to regular school classes as well as from primary to secondary education. The foundation also invests in lifelong learning. In view of the demographic changes ahead, this is 'the key to helping individuals improve their life and work chances'.  Politics and Society  The foundation aims to promote public debates on current issues and critical analysis of controversial political and social topics. The 'Bucerius Summer School' and the 'Asian Forum' provide networking opportunities for young leaders. Supporting independent journalism in Eastern Europe is another area of investment.  Bucerius Lab  The 'Bucerius Lab' examines the 'effects of digitization' in public discussions and at conferences.  Publications  The foundation's own publication series 'Hamburger K√∂pfe' aims to portray 'groundbreaking Hamburg personalities' , the last to date Gyula Trebitsch. The volumes are published by Ellert & Richter Verlag. Bucerius Law School and Bucerius Kunst Forum also produce their own publications.

The book discusses the history of parasites on Earth and how the field and study of parasitology formed, along with a look at the most dangerous parasites ever found in nature. A special paperback edition was released in March 2011 for the tenth anniversary of the book's publishing, including a new epilogue written by Zimmer. Signed bookplates were also given to fans that sent in a photo of themselves with a copy of the special edition. The cover of Parasite Rex includes a scanning electron microscope image of a tick as the focus, along with a number of illustrations in the centerfold of parasites and topics discussed in the book. Content The book begins by discussing the history of parasites in human knowledge, from the earliest writings about them in ancient cultures, up through modern times. The focus comes to rest extensively on the views and experiments conducted by scientists in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, such as those done by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, Japetus Steenstrup, Friedrich K√ºchenmeister, and Ray Lankester. Among them, Leeuwenhoek was the first to ever physically view cells through a microscope, Steenstrup was the first to explain and confirm the multiple stages and life cycles of parasites that are different from most other living organisms, and K√ºchenmeister, through his religious beliefs and his views on every creature having a place in the natural order, denied the ideas of his time and proved that all parasites are a part of active evolutionary niches and not biological dead ends by conducting morally ambiguous experiments on prisoners. Lankester is given a specific focus and repeated discussion throughout the book due to his belief that parasites are examples of degenerative evolution, especially in regards to Sacculina, and Zimmer's repeated refutation of this idea. Several chapters are taken to discuss various types of parasites and how they infect and control their hosts, along with the biochemistry involved in their take-over or evasion of their host's immune system, eventually leading to their dispersal into their next form and life cycle. An extended time is also given on the workings of immunology and how the immune systems of living beings respond to parasite infection, along with the methods that bodily functions use to counteract and potentially kill invading microorganisms. Woven into this discussion are several specific sites that Zimmer visited during his writing of Parasite Rex and the scientists he worked with to understand different biosystems and all the parasites that live within them, including human sleeping sickness infections in Sudan from the tsetse fly, the parasites of frogs in Costa Rica, primarily showcased by filarial worms that infect humans and a variety of species, and the USDA National Parasite Collection based out of Maryland. The final chapters focus on an overall effect parasites have had on the evolution of life and the theory that it is due to parasitic infection that sexual reproduction evolved to become dominant, in contrast to previous asexual reproduction methods, due to the increased genetic variety and thus potential parasitic resistance that this would confer. This research was showcased by W. D. Hamilton and his theories on the evolution of sex, along with the Red Queen hypothesis and the idea of an evolutionary arms race between parasites and their hosts. Zimmer then discusses a final time the wide variety of parasites that evolved to have humans as their primary hosts and our attempts through scientific advancement to eradicate them. The closing chapter considers the positive benefits of parasites and how humans have used them to improve agriculture and medical technology, but also how ill-considered usage of parasites could also destroy various habitats by having them act as invasive species. In the end, Zimmer ponders whether humanity counts as a parasite on the planet and what the effects of this relationship could be. Style and tone In a review for Science, Albert O. Bush pointed out how Zimmer creates a writing style that is written with \\"clarity, conviction, and seemingly without prejudice\\" and that while the \\"purist will find the odd mistakes, oversights, and minor errors of fact\\", these are \\"insignificant\\" and do not remove from Parasite Rex's \\"overall quality or, more importantly, its focus and take-home message.\\" Critical reception The New York Times' Kevin Padian praised the book and Zimmer's writing, saying that it showcases him as \\"fine a science essayist as we have\\" and that the importance of this book rests \\"not only in its accessible presentation of the new science of evolutionary parasitology but in its thoughtful treatment of the global strategies and policies that scientists, health workers and governments will have to consider in order to manage parasites in the future\\". Publishers Weekly called the book a \\"exemplary work of popular science\\" and one of the \\"most fascinating works\\" of its kind, while also being \\"its most disgusting\\". Margaret Henderson, writing for the Library Journal, recommended the book for placement in all libraries, saying that the book \\"makes parasitology interesting and accessible to anyone\\". Writing in the Quarterly Review of Biology, May Berenbaum describes Parasite Rex as a \\"remarkable book\\" that is \\"unique in its focus and is extremely readable\\" and earns the reviewer's \\"respect and recommendation\\" for being able to discuss the life cycles of lancet flukes and the Red Queen hypothesis properly in a single book. Joe Eaton in the Whole Earth Review categorized Parasite Rex as \\"one of those books that change the way you see the world\\" due to how it shows that ecosystems are largely made up of the parasites that the individual organisms carry. A review in The American Biology Teacher by Donald A. Lawrence labeled the book as a \\"splendid overview of current knowledge about parasites\\" and praised the extensive Notes, Literature Cited, and Index sections. The newsletter editor for the American Society of Parasitologists, Scott Lyell Gardner, congratulated the book for bringing the field of parasitology into the public view, saying that how Zimmer \\"presents parasites in the ‚Äúugh‚Äù and ‚Äúoooh‚Äù mode, in addition to trying to show how parasitologists actually ply our trade\\" helps to provide interest into the subject. BlueSci writer Harriet Allison summed up the book as one where Zimmer \\"manages to weave just enough easily understandable science into each chapter in order to create an engrossing and squirm-inducing story that will have you hooked until the end\\". Kirkus Reviews stated its acclaim for the \\"vivid detail\\" given to the lifestyles of parasites, calling the book an \\"eye- opening perspective on biology, ecology, and medicine\\" and \\"well worth reading\\".

Austin's Texas colony. Freeman Irby Booth, a wealthy landowner who owned a cotton gin, general store, lumberyard and syrup mill, founded the settlement in the 1890s. The community received a post office in 1894. Two years later there was a school, Baptist church and 150 residents. By 1914, a population of about 300 was served by a bank and telephone connections. The community's segregated schools taught 85 white and 177 black students in 1926. From the mid-1920s through 1948, about 100 people lived in the settlement. During the 1940s Booth had a school and two churches but by the end of the decade there were only 40 persons living there. In the 1980s there were two businesses and by 1990 there were about 60 residents. File:Booth TX Old School.JPGAbandoned schoolhouse in Booth File:Booth TX House 1911.jpgResidence of F.I.

Flybys=Pioneer 11 flyby Pioneer 11 image of Saturn. Saturn was first visited by Pioneer 11 in September 1979. It flew within 20,000 km of the top of the planet's cloud layer. Low-resolution images were acquired of the planet and a few of its moons; the resolution of the images was not good enough to discern surface features. The spacecraft also studied the rings; among the discoveries were the thin F-ring and the fact that dark gaps in the rings are bright when viewed towards the Sun, or in other words, they are not empty of material. Pioneer 11 also measured the temperature of Titan at 250 K.http://spaceprojects.arc.nasa.gov/Space_Projects/pioneer/PN10&11.html Voyager In November 1980, the Voyager 1 probe visited the Saturn system. It sent back the first high-resolution images of the planet, rings, and satellites. Surface features of various moons were seen for the first time. Because of the earlier discovery of a thick atmosphere on Titan, the Voyager controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory elected for Voyager 1 to make a close approach of Titan. This greatly increased knowledge of the atmosphere of the moon, but also proved that Titan's atmosphere is impenetrable in visible wavelengths, so no surface details were seen. The flyby also changed the spacecraft's trajectory out from the plane of the Solar System which prevented Voyager 1 from completing the Planetary Grand Tour of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. Almost a year later, in August 1981, Voyager 2 continued the study of the Saturn system. More close-up images of Saturn's moons were acquired, as well as evidence of changes in the rings. Voyager 2 probed Saturn's upper atmosphere with its radar, to measure temperature and density profiles. Voyager 2 found that at the highest levels (7 kilopascals pressure) Saturn's temperature was 70 K (‚àí203 ¬∞C) (i.e. 70 degrees above absolute zero), while at the deepest levels measured (120 kilopascals) the temperature increased to 143 K (‚àí130 ¬∞C). The north pole was found to be 10 K cooler, although this may be seasonal. Unfortunately, during the flyby, the probe's turnable camera platform stuck for a couple of days and some planned imaging was lost. Saturn's gravity was used to direct the spacecraft's trajectory towards Uranus. The probes discovered and confirmed several new satellites orbiting near or within the planet's rings. They also discovered the small Maxwell and Keeler gaps in the rings. Cassini orbiter Saturn eclipses the Sun, as seen from Cassini. Animation of Cassini trajectory around Saturn from 1 May 2004 to 15 September 2017 On July 1, 2004, the Cassini‚ÄìHuygens spacecraft performed the SOI (Saturn Orbit Insertion) maneuver and entered into orbit around Saturn. Before the SOI, Cassini had already studied the system extensively. In June 2004, it had conducted a close flyby of Phoebe, sending back high-resolution images and data. The orbiter completed two Titan flybys before releasing the Huygens probe on December 25, 2004. Huygens descended onto the surface of Titan on January 14, 2005, sending a flood of data during the atmospheric descent and after the landing. During 2005 Cassini conducted multiple flybys of Titan and icy satellites. On March 10, 2006, NASA reported that the Cassini probe found evidence of liquid water reservoirs that erupt in geysers on Saturn's moon Enceladus.Cassini‚ÄìHuygens: News On September 20, 2006, a Cassini probe photograph revealed a previously undiscovered planetary ring, outside the brighter main rings of Saturn and inside the G and E rings.New Ring Spotted Around Saturn ‚Äì Article on CNN.com. In July 2006, Cassini saw the first proof of hydrocarbon lakes near Titan's north pole, which was confirmed in January 2007. In March 2007, additional images near Titan's north pole discovered hydrocarbon \\"seas\\", the largest of which is almost the size of the Caspian Sea. In 2009, the probe discovered and confirmed four new satellites. Its primary mission ended in 2008, when the spacecraft completed 74 orbits around the planet. In 2010, the probe began its first extended mission, the Cassini Equinox Mission. The Cassini Solstice Mission, the second mission extension, lasted through September 2017.Cassini Solstice Mission The mission ended on September 15, 2017, after a planned atmospheric entry into the planet Saturn. :For the latest information and news releases, see Cassini website.

He also represented the Players against the Gentlemen on four occasions. He was born in Brecon and died aged 69 in Worcester. Having appeared for the county on a number of occasions before its elevation to the County Championship, Bowley made his first-class debut in Worcestershire's second match at that level, against Sussex at Hove in mid-May 1899. He opened the batting with Wilfrid Foster, but was bowled for 4 in each innings, though he did take a catch to dismiss opposing captain Billy Murdoch. Four further games that season produced no success, with a highest score of just 21. After a near miss with 95 against Sussex a few days earlier, Bowley scored his maiden hundred by hitting 118 against Hampshire at the end of May 1900. Although he made no further centuries that summer, he did pass a thousand runs for the season, averaging just over 24. For several years thereafter he was a significant contributor to Worcestershire's batting, enjoying the most productive season of his career in 1906 when he hit 1,629 first-class runs (1,466 of them for Worcestershire) with two hundreds and 11 fifties. He played rather fewer games in 1907 and 1908, and came nowhere near his thousand runs in either season, but from 1909 until first-class cricket was interrupted by the First World War he achieved the mark every year except 1912. In June 1914 he made his highest score, 276 against Hampshire at Dudley; this established a county record that survived until surpassed by Glenn Turner's 311* 68 years later. Bowley was well into his forties when county cricket resumed in 1919, but he nevertheless played on for several years and scoring consistently in a weak Worcestershire side. His highest post-war innings was the 188 he hit against Somerset in 1921, and that season he passed 1,000 runs for the 14th and last time, falling just short with 974 in 1922. He played one further first-class match, against Hampshire in May 1923, aged 49, but made just 0 and 5 as Worcestershire slipped to a two-day innings defeat. His bowling was of the strictly occasional variety, but he did take four wickets in first-class cricket, his first and last victims (Albert Relf in 1900 and Jack Board in 1904) being Test players.

Rotherham was a Bible scholar and minister of the Churches of Christ, who described his goal as \\"placing the reader of the present time in as good a position as that occupied by the reader of the first century for understanding the Apostolic Writings\\". The New Testament Critically Emphasised was first published in 1872. However, great changes occurred in textual criticism during the second half of the 19th century, culminating in Brooke Foss Westcott's and Fenton John Anthony Hort's Greek text of the New Testament. This led Rotherham to revise his New Testament twice, in 1878 and 1897, to stay abreast of scholarly developments. The entire Bible with the Old Testament appeared in 1902. Rotherham based his Old Testament translation on Dr. C.D. Ginsburg's comprehensive Masoretico- critical edition of the Hebrew Bible, which anticipated readings now widely accepted. Rotherham's translation has stayed in print over the years because of the wealth of information it presents. John R Kohlenberger III says in his preface to the 1994 printing, \\"The Emphasized Bible is one of the most innovative and thoroughly researched translations ever done by a single individual.

Founder of the Maternity Hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Ripley was one of the most outspoken activists for disadvantaged female rights. A prominent leader in the American Woman Suffrage Association, Ripley also served six years as president of the Minnesota Woman Suffrage Association. Early years Martha George Rogers was born November 30, 1843, in Lowell, Vermont, the oldest of five children of Esther Ann (George) and Francis Rogers, a stock farmer.Solberg, Witon U. \\"Martha G. Ripley: Pioneer Doctor and Social Reformer\\". Minnesota History, Spring 1964, pp. 1‚Äì17. The family moved to the Iowa frontier, where she attended high school (leaving without a diploma). She was awarded a first- class teacher's certificate and taught elementary school for a time. In 1867 she married rancher William Warren Ripley, son of a well-known Massachusetts mill-owning family. Shortly thereafter they moved back to his home state of Massachusetts, where he took up a job as manager of his uncle's paper mill in Lawrence. The couple had three daughters, Abigail, Clara, and Edna May. Within a few years, William had bought his own mill and moved the family to Middleton. Ripley joined the suffragists in 1875 and worked to establish an active suffrage group in Middleton, becoming close friends of Boston suffragettes Lucy Stone and Henry Browne Blackwell. The success of her efforts gained her a place in the statewide suffrage movement, and she was elected to both the central committee and the executive committee of the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association, serving in both capacities until 1883. It is known that Ripley was an excellent public speaker and often outspoken, leading her to be well-known and liked by many professional women and several doctors. Medical and public health career Ripley's concern over the health issues facing women who worked in the Massachusetts textile mills prompted her to go to medical school. Ripley enrolled in 1880 at Boston University Medical School(from which one of her sisters had recently graduated) and earned her M.D. degree in 1883. Ripley was enrolled in the Homeopathy tradition rather than the male-dominated Allopathic medicine. That same year, her husband was badly injured in a mill accident and forced to retire from his mill business. Now dependent financially on Ripley's ability to earn a living, the couple moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where William had relatives and where a growing industrial sector offered scope for enterprising incomers. Maternity Hospital in 2008 With some difficulty, Ripley established a medical practice in Minneapolis and became a successful obstetrician. She received her license to practice in 1883, making her one of the first two dozen licensed women doctors in the state. The same year, Ripley was elected president of the Minnesota Woman Suffrage Association and through her considerable connections, brought the national convention of the American Woman Suffrage Association to Minneapolis in 1885. During her six-year tenure as president, she often spoke out about public health issues such as city sanitation, clean water, food adulteration, and crowding of patients in hospitals. Ripley also promoted more matrons on the police force and women's involvement on the city board. She became an early advocate for cremation, on the grounds of both public health and reduced costs for the urban poor. After presidency, Ripley continued her involvement in association for an additional six years as a member of the association's medical board. Amongst other discriminatory issues, until 1891, the age of consent was ten years old. In one of the many letters written to a Minneapolis editor, Ripley noted that the property of young girls was better protected by the state than their persons. Upon the adopting a law during the 26th Legislature of Minnesota in 1889 empowering fathers to deny rights to their unborn children, Ripley replied the bill to be \\"worthy of the Dark Ages\\". In the campaign of raising the age of consent for girls from 10 years old to 18 years old, Ripley partially succeeded when in 1891 the state legislature raised the age of consent to 14. Like other women doctors of the time, Ripley found that most of her patients were women and young children who often had trouble accessing hospital care; for instance, no Minneapolis hospitals of the era would admit a pregnant woman who was unmarried. Ripley was inspired to start a new hospital run by and for women, especially women in economically straightened circumstances. Incorporated in 1887, her Maternity Hospital‚Äîlater renamed Ripley Memorial Hospital‚Äîremained in operation until 1957, when it was closed due to low occupancy and funding problems. From its start in 1886, just three years after Ripley's graduation, Maternity Hospital quickly grew to a twenty-room facility and functioned \\"to provide a lying-in hospital\\" both for married women without means of adequate care and for \\"girls who have previously borne a good character\\" but \\"have been led astray.\\" In 1896, the hospital moved to the corner of Western and Penn Avenue North, where it solidified its reputation through the lowest maternal death rates in the region and became the first Minneapolis hospital to establish a social service department. Through Ripley's continued efforts, the hospital and her advocacies strengthened the suffragette movement in Minnesota with leaders such Frances Willard and Carrie Chapman Catt, who were often guests of Ripley's. Her activism was well known, respected, but often ridiculed. Ripley was also nominated director of public schools, but she was notably not elected due to her ineligibility as a female. Ripley was also a professor of children's diseases at the Homeopathic Medical College in Minnesota and was active in the Women's Rescue League, which aided prostitutes. Starting in 1883, Ripley served six years as president of the Minnesota Woman Suffrage Association and continued for another six years as a member of the association's medical board after stepping down as president. Among the campaigns she was involved in was one to raise the age of consent for girls from 10 years old to 18 years old (which only partly succeeded: in 1891 the state legislature raised the age of consent to 14). At one point, Ripley went so far as to personally petition the state senate for the right to vote. On April 18, 1912, Dr. Martha George Ripley died due to complications from a respiratory infection and rheumatic heart disease. In accordance with her own views, she was cremated. In 1939, a plaque honoring her as a pioneer woman physician and hospital founder was installed in the Minnesota state capitol building's rotunda. Upon the closure of Maternity Hospital in 1957, the hospital structure was sold, and the proceeds were used to create the Ripley Memorial Foundation. Since 1993, the foundation has focused on supporting programs that prevent teenage pregnancies. In 2007, the hospital building was converted into apartments and renamed Ripley Gardens, a redevelopment funded in part by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. \\"Her ashes were eventually placed in the cornerstone (...)\\" of this current building. In the book, History of the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota \\" written before her death said, (...) she has proven herself friend of the friendless, the consoler of the sorrowing, the wise counselor and efficient helper of the unfortunate.\\" References Category:1843 births Category:1912 deaths Category:People from Lowell, Vermont Category:People from Minneapolis Category:American obstetricians Category:Physicians from Minnesota Category:American women physicians ","title":"Martha Ripley"},{"id":"10844726","text":"Devra Lee Davis, (born June 7, 1946) is an American epidemiologist and writer.

Controversies Tackling publicly sensitive topics from tobacco, to asbestos to overuse of diagnostic radiation, Davis's findings and methods have been criticized, in some cases being called \\"junk science\\", especially for raising concerns about cellphone safety. Davis publicly criticized the prominent epidemiologist Sir Richard Doll, noting in her book The Secret History of the War on Cancer that his work discovering the link between tobacco and lung cancer in 1955 had been influenced by earlier German studies in the 1930s that he had not acknowledged. Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet, reviewed Davis' work favorably in a lengthy analysis in The New York Review of Books, taking great exception, however, to her critique of Doll. Awards Davis was honored by the Betty Ford Comprehensive Cancer Center and the American Cancer Society with the Breast Cancer Awareness Award, commended by the Director of the National Cancer Institute for Outstanding Service, and appointed a Global Environmental advisor to Newsweek Magazine.

It is the largest and oldest lighthouse heritage organization in Canada. The society was formed in 1993 by a group of lighthouse supporters who met on a trip to Sambro Island Lighthouse, near Halifax, the oldest surviving lighthouse in North America. The society lists its goals as supporting the preservation and awareness of lighthouses, assisting community groups in leasing or taking ownership of lighthouses, developing research and acting as a watchdog on the state of lighthouses. The society organizes regular lectures and trips to historic lighthouses. It also publishes a newsletter called The Lightkeeper. The society's accomplishments include winning heritage status for Sambro Island lighthouse, providing grants for lighthouse restoration, creating the Craig Harding Lighthouse Preservation Award, an oral history program and inspiring federal legislation which became the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act. About twenty community groups and 200 individuals belong to the society. They meet in Halifax at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic and co-sponsor many public events with the Museum.

Life The son of Colonel Paulet Welbore Colebrooke, R.A. (died 1816), and a daughter of Major-General Grant, he was educated at Woolwich, entering the Royal Artillery as a first lieutenant on 12 September 1803. In 1805 he was ordered to the East Indies‚Äîfirst to Ceylon, then in 1806 to Malabar, and back to Ceylon in 1807. He went to India in 1809, and served with the field army there through 1810, becoming a captain on 27 September 1810. Colebrooke next served in Java, and was wounded in the operations against the Dutch in that island in 1811; here he remained under the British occupation, and was deputy quartermaster-general in 1813, being promoted major on 1 June 1813. He was sent as political agent and commissioner to Palembong in Sumatra, and on to Bengal in 1814. He resumed his old duties in Java in 1815, and was ordered to India on the conclusion of peace and the restoration of Java to the Dutch on 19 August 1816. He served through the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1817‚Äì8, and accompanied the expedition to the Persian Gulf in 1818. He returned to England in 1821. From 1822 to 1832 Colebrooke was one of the commissioners of what was known as the Colebrooke‚ÄìCameron Commission (Eastern Inquiry): a long and elaborate investigation into the administration and revenues of Ceylon, where he resided on the business of the inquiry from 1825 to 1831. On 9 September 1834 he became Lieutenant-Governor of the Bahamas; he went by way of Jamaica, spending about a month there and arriving at Nassau on a ship-of-war on 26 February 1835. His first speech to the Assembly was on 7 April 1835. He administered the colony during the days when slavery gave way to the apprenticeship system prior to its final abolition. On 13 February 1837 he was gazetted as Governor of the Leeward Islands, being at the time on leave in England. He assumed the government of Antigua and the other islands on 11 May 1837, and one of his earliest official acts was the proclamation of Queen Victoria. In this government, as in the Bahamas, he tried to improve education and reform prison discipline; he also urged the restoration of the old general council of the Leewards. On 25 July 1840 he left Antigua for Liverpool, and after an extended leave was on 26 March 1841 made lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick. Here his tenure of office was uneventful, the question of the Maine boundary being the chief public matter affecting the colony at that time; he did, however, suggest a special scheme for colonisation, which had no practical results. On 9 November 1846 he became Colonel in the army, though he was not Colonel of artillery till later. On 27 November 1847 he was gazetted to British Guiana, but never took up the appointment, going instead on 11 August 1848, as governor, to Barbados, where he also administered the Windward Islands. Colebrooke worked for the suppression of crime and the improvement of the prisons. He also suggested a federation of all the Windward Islands, anticipating later proposals. In 1854 the withdrawal of imperial troops from the smaller islands caused some apprehension, but the peace of the islands was not really disturbed. He became Major-general on 20 June 1854. In January 1856 he relinquished his government and returned to England. He was promoted Lieutenant-general on 16 January 1859 and general 26 December 1865, and he was colonel commanding the Royal Artillery from 25 September 1859 till his death. He resided at Salt Hill, near Slough, Buckinghamshire, where he died on 6 February 1870. He had become K.H. in 1834, Knight Bachelor in 1837, and received C.B. (civil) in 1848. Family Colebrooke married, in 1820, Emma Sophia, daughter of Lieutenant-colonel Robert Colebrooke (died 1808), surveyor-general of Bengal; she died in 1851.

He was described as, \\"A great defender and a confident ball player.\\" Background Elford was born in Casino, New South Wales, Australia. Playing career Hailing from Casino, Elford was a Surf lifesaving sprint champion before starting his professional league career. He came to the Western Suburbs club in 1966 as a winger but later was shifted to the forwards where he remained the rest of his career. By 1968 he was playing on the wing for Sydney Seconds. In 1969 Elford appealed against the league's transfer and retention system, that prevented him from joining another club. He claimed that players had attended training with the \\"smell of alcohol on their breath,\\" and they, \\"later became sick on the field.\\" He went on to accuse a coach of wanting, \\"to fight everyone in the first grade behind a shed, one at a time\\" He took no part in the 1969 season. Despite his previous problems with Magpies, he signed a contract to stay with the club for five years at the start of 1972. Later that year he made his representative debut for New South Wales, in what was described as, \\"a powerhouse display,\\" by, \\"a rugged young second-rower who delights in the role of crashing defence and can split the opposition in attacking bursts.\\" Elford was then subsequently selected for the Australian national side that same year, scoring two tries in a match against New Zealand. He would be selected for the Australian side in the 1972 Rugby League World Cup held in France but broke his arm in a warm-up fixture prior to the tournament and could not take part. He is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No. 461.ARL Annual Report 2005, page 55 His promising career was however often halted by injuries, and he was forced out of the entire 1973 season. In 1975, the tendons were operated on and he had a new plate placed in his arm. His career finished in 1976 after another broken arm.

He was raised on Beacon Hill, Seattle, Washington. Teodros' music often features socially conscious themes, and he was a catalyst in the surge of dynamic underground rap acts from the Pacific Northwest during the first decade of the 2000s.[ Biography by Cyril Cordor]. Allmusic. Early life Teodros was born and raised in Seattle, Washington to an Ethiopian mother and a father of Scottish, Irish and Native American descent. \\"Interview: Gabriel Teodros\\". The Find Magazine. July 13, 2010. His parents met through anti-war organizing in the 1970s, and they split up around the time Gabriel was born. He stayed with his mother, and met grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins as they first emigrated to the United States and all stayed in the same house.Interview: Gabriel Teodros. The Find Magazine. July 13, 2010. Teodros's relationship with hip hop culture began at a young age within the South Seattle neighborhood of Beacon Hill. \\"A lot of kids in my neighborhood were affected by gang culture. And I kind of had a death wish. I felt like, at an early age, that I wasn‚Äôt going to live to 21\\" he said in an interview with Sheeko Magazine. He spent his high school years in Las Vegas, Nevada where as one out of approximately 30 students of color in a predominantly white school, something within him changed. \\"It was the first time I understood that there was a system in place that wanted kids like me to want to die. And understanding that in high school made me want to live.\\" he says in the same interview. The former breakdancer, graffiti writer and closet-emcee finally began to take his career path seriously at age 16, using hip hop to both understand and explain his world.\\"Profile: Gabriel Teodros\\" by Alison Isaac. Sheeko Magazine. July 2008. Music career=1999-2005: Beginnings and Abyssinian Creole Teodros began his musical career around 1999, when he returned to Seattle and began working with a live band called 500 Years. That same year, he met an MC named Khalil Crisis (better known as Khingz), from the group Maroon Colony. The 2 groups began sharing bills together all over Seattle and the 2 MC's also began working with a community organization called Youth Undoing Institutionalized Racism. In 2001, YUIR sent them to a conference in New Orleans, and it was there that Teodros and Khingz saw how much they had in common outside of music. They formed the group Abyssinian Creole to both represent their peoples and the bridges between them.Gabriel Teodros (of Abyssinian Creole) - interview by Todd E. Jones. Insomniac Magazine. December 19, 2006. Also in 2001, Teodros released his first solo album entitled Sun To A Recycled Soul. In 2005, Abyssinian Creole released its debut album, Sexy Beast, a record that gives expression to the post-1990s cosmopolitanism thriving in South Seattle. \\"Let 'Lovework' Rule\\" by Charles Mudede.

January 10, 2008. 2006-2007: Lovework In the spring of 2006, Teodros completed the entire Lovework album with producer Amos Miller, around the same time MassLine Media was being formed with Teodros, Blue Scholars & Common Market. Lovework had additional beat contributions from Sabzi of Blue Scholars, Moka Only, Kitone, and Specs One. Its sound was primarily influenced by Seattle veteran Vitamin D (who also mixed the record) and the late J Dilla. The album title, Lovework was inspired by bell hooks and her book All About Love: New Visions, where hooks insists that to truly know love, one must agree that love is a verb. She goes further to say to truly know love, one must work to undo every system of domination that stops people from truly loving. The title was also inspired by a quote from Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet where Gibran says \\"Work is love made visible\\". Also in 2006, Good Medicine was formed: a four-person group composed of Teodros, Khingz, Macklemore and Geologic of Blue Scholars. Good Medicine have headlined a handful of shows in the Seattle area but have never released any music as a group.\\"Things are hopping for hip-hoppers Blue Scholars\\" by Tom Scanlon .

Koreans started coming to the Arab world in large numbers in early 1970s as migrant labourers; between 1975 and 1985, 1.1 million Koreans came for work, which made it the third-most popular destination for Korean emigrants. Eventually, most returned home or moved on to other countries, and , the South Korean government's own figures showed over 24 thousand of their nationals living in the region. However, South Korean nationals are present in all of the region's countries, and North Korean workers also have a growing presence in several of them. History Though Korea had a long history of trading contact with the Arab world by means of intermediaries, there were no recorded Korean visitors before 1959, when two Korean Muslims went to Mecca for the hajj. In 1974, the first South Korean firm won a contract in the region, for highway construction in Saudi Arabia, and imported 218 South Korean construction workers, the first Korean residents, to assist in the project. The following year, 3,593 South Koreans went to Saudi Arabia for work. By 1977, migrants to Saudi Arabia alone composed nearly one-fifth of all registered emigration from South Korea, making it the third-most popular destination for emigrants (the top two being Japan and the United States, each of which had longstanding Korean communities, Korean Americans and Zainichi Koreans). The growth in the South Korean migrant worker population reflected a deliberate policy of the government to promote manpower exports; they had established a special department for this purpose as early as the mid-1960s, and in the 1970s, construction enterprises were given priority in order to facilitate their entry into overseas markets. Over two dozen South Korean companies employed migrant labour, the largest such employer being Hyundai Construction; Koreans were described as having a \\"competitive advantage\\" over workers of other nationalities due to their discipline and level of skill, which some commentators attributed to South Korea's practise of universal male conscription. Unlike their Western competitors, Koreans worked around the clock in shifts; huge lighting systems were installed to facilitate night work. A survey of migrants showed that 73% were between 25 and 40 years old; under half (48%) of the regular workers were married, while 69% of contract workers were. The receiving countries were concerned about the effect that long-term residence of migrant workers could have on their societies; they preferred Korean workers because they were unaccompanied by family members and so stayed only for short periods. The typical length of an assignment in the region was three years. Migration to the region would peak in 1982 and 1983. Wages were around four to five million won, roughly twice what could be earned in South Korea at the time, and workers typically remitted 80% of their salaries. Families used saved remittances to purchase houses or start businesses. However, migration was not a success for everyone: roughly one-in- ten workers returned from the Middle East reported a decrease in income, usually due to inability to find suitable work. The hot, dry climate and long work hours also resulted in health problems for many workers, and the medical bills whittled away at their savings. Several factors in the late 1980s contributed to decreasing the amount of Korean migration. Increasing labour unrest initiated by South Korean workers provided one stimulus for the localisation of the workforce. South Korea's rising labour costs were another reason. During the latter half of the 1980s, the proportion of Korean labourers working on construction projects for Hyundai declined from 70% to only 20‚Äì30% during the 1980s, with the shortfall being taken up by local labourers instead. By 1990, only 56,000 South Korean migrant workers went abroad to any destination, a drop of over 70% since 1982. By 1992, the wage gap between South Korea and the rich countries of the Middle East had largely disappeared. The South Korean population would shrink over the following decade before rebounding slightly to 13,008 by 2009. Over the next two years, the population would show rapid growth of nearly 27%, reaching 16,461 by 2011. Nearly three-quarters of that recent population growth was driven by increased migration to the United Arab Emirates. Furthermore, in an echo of the South Korean policy of the 1970s and 1980s, the North Korean government has also been sending its workers abroad to earn hard currency for their country recently. , there were estimated to be six thousand North Korean workers in various Arab countries, including Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Yemen; like the South Koreans two decades earlier, they also work primarily in construction-related trades such as welding and carpentry. By country=Bahrain Bahrain was a minor destination for South Korean migrant workers in the late 1970s and early 1980s. South Korea used to have an embassy in Bahrain from 1976 to 1999, but closed it in a round of cost-cutting measures after the 1997 Asian financial crisis. However, South Korean companies continued to do business in various fields in Bahrain, including construction, heavy industry, power, desalination plants and electronic engineering. In 2001, there were only about 70 South Koreans in Bahrain, primarily corporate assignees. However, the small population was enough to support a single Korean supermarket as well as a few Korean restaurants. As of 2011, South Korean consular statistics recorded 282 of their nationals living in Bahrain. Four had Bahraini nationality, while the other 278 were on temporary visas. Their population grew by about 15% since 2009. There were no international students. However, in 2012, in 2012, Bahrain and South Korea signed an agreement on promoting study abroad exchanges between the two countries. Egypt Egypt was a relatively minor destination for Korean migrant workers. The Cairo Korean School, founded on 5 December 1979, is one of the region's few Korean day schools; it enrolled 27 students at the elementary level . However, their student numbers have been falling, and from 2002 until 2008 they did not even hold any graduation ceremony. There is also a Korean church in Cairo, which conducts various outreach activities. , South Korean consular statistics recorded 995 of their nationals or former nationals living in Egypt, with 886 in Cairo and surroundings, and 109 living in other parts of the country. 21 are Egyptian nationals, 65 are international students, and 909 have other kinds of visas. Their population has remained roughly stable since 2009. The Korean School in Cairo (), a South Korean international school, is in New Cairo.Home. Korean School in Cairo (). 1 August 2015. Retrieved on 21 September 2015. \\"48 Rd 1st Zone 6th Area New Cairo, Egypt\\" Iraq The first group of nine South Korean workers arrived in Iraq in 1975; however, until the end of 1980, only a total of 1,958 registered emigrants went to the country. However, their numbers would increase along with the intensification of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War; from 1981 until 1985, Iraq was consistently the second to fourth-most popular Arab world destination for South Korean migrant labourers, a total of whom 66,665 went to the country during that period. In March 2003, then-president Roh Moo-hyun agreed to dispatch a contingent of ROK army engineers to Iraq. Later the South Koreans expanded their presence, creating an entirely new division, the Zaytun Division, consisting of 3,600 troops; they were sent to Iraq in September 2004. As of March 2007, about 1,600 remained; another 400 were expected to return home in April, with the others departing by the end of the year. There were also 113 South Korean civilians in Iraq . Jordan Jordan was only a minor destination for South Korean migrant workers in the 1970s and 1980s. The first group of 90 migrant workers arrived in 1975; from then until 1985, a total of 12,544 came to the country. The number reached its peak with 2,404 in 1980 but fell to less than a quarter that level by 1985. By 2011, the country had the Arab world's seventh-largest Korean population. From 356 in 2009, the number of South Korean nationals grew by 66% to 592 in 2011. Among them, 48 were international students, while 544 held other types of visas; none had become Jordanian nationals. The vast majority (556, or 94%) lived in Amman or its surroundings, with another 14 living at Irbid, and 22 in other places. South Koreans in the country pursue a variety of professions. Some are interested in investing in construction projects in the country. The Korea International Cooperation Agency has been sending Korean language instructors to the University of Jordan and other universities in the country since 2002. More controversially, some of the South Koreans in Jordan are missionaries. By 2004, there were estimated to be at least 30 South Korean Christian missionary families living in Amman. Many had previously lived in Iraq but left the country under pressure from the South Korean government; after their arrival in Jordan, they often worked with Iraqi migrants and refugees in the country in an effort to convert them. One well-known South Korean who grew up in Jordan and naturalised as a citizen there is Won Ho Chung, an Arabic-speaking comedian who rose to fame in the region through the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour in 2007. Kuwait Koreans in Kuwait first arrived in 1975 as employees of South Korean construction companies, although the two countries did not establish formal relations until June 1979. By this time, Kuwait had already become the second-most popular Middle Eastern destination for Korean workers behind Saudi Arabia; by that time, 13,813 Korean workers had already come to Kuwait. However, Kuwait would soon lose the second-place position, being surpassed by Libya in 1981 and Iraq in 1982. Koreans in Kuwait generally did not receive a welcome from or assimilate to the local society; in common with Indians, Filipinos, and Pakistanis, they were described as being at the bottom of the social structure, \\"ridiculed and stripped of their rights\\". Nor did they spend much of their money locally; as meals and housing were provided for them in their work camps, it was estimated that they remitted 80% of their earnings back to South Korea. In spite of these difficulties, between 1975 and 1985, 63,898 South Korean workers came to Kuwait, and as late as 1990, roughly 10,000 were estimated to remain. Kuwait's only school for Korean nationals, the Kuwait Hangul School, was established in 1991. Most South Koreans returned home in the following decade, and , only 1,000 South Korean nationals resided in the country. There were no known former South Korean nationals with Kuwaiti nationality; six were international students, and the remainder had other kinds of visas. There was formerly a small contingent of South Korean soldiers in Kuwait, who numbered 170. South Korean civilian employees from the United States Army's Camp Casey in Dongducheon, Gyeonggi-do have been deployed to bases in Kuwait, including Camp Arifjan, in support of the US Army. In 2005, a group calling itself Kuwait Mujahideen claimed to have killed a Korean national as part of an attack on a US Army base in Umm Al-Hayman near Al Ahmadi. North Korean companies have established a greater presence in Kuwait recent years, and the government of South Korea estimated that there are roughly three or four thousand North Korean construction workers in the country . Air Koryo, the national airline of North Korea, began operating weekly flights between Pyongyang and Kuwait City in 2011. Libya Though Libya did not receive its first South Korean workers until 1977, it quickly became a popular destination; it was the only Arab country which experienced consistent growth in the number of Korean workers between 1981 and 1985, and by 1985 it had already become the Arab world's second most popular destination, with 23,138 arrivals from South Korea. In total, from 1977 until 1985, 103,953 South Koreans came to Libya. However, virtually all returned home, and , it was estimated that only 854 South Korean nationals lived in the country. The South Korean population fell a further 87% in the next two years, leaving just 111 South Koreans in the country. Libya also has a Korean weekend school, founded in 2000; it enrolled 22 students from kindergarten to high school levels . North Korea also dispatched labourers to Libya in the 1980s and 1990s; a batch of Northern construction workers arrived in Libya in 2008. There were estimated to be roughly 200 North Korean expatriates in Libya . Among them are construction workers, doctors, and nurses. They were not evacuated during the Libyan civil war that year. South Korean official media reported that Pyongyang had explicitly ordered their nationals in Libya and Egypt not to return home. Qatar South Korea and Qatar established diplomatic relations in 1974, and two years later, the South Korean embassy opened in Doha. Qatar was never a major destination for South Korean labourers; the first group of 636 workers did not arrive until 1976, and until 1985, only a total of 12,816 South Korean emigrants chose Qatar as their destination. Unlike in other countries in the region, Korean workers in Qatar did not just come as employees of Korean companies, but also as subcontractors of Japanese companies as well. Qatar Airways is one of the major employers of South Koreans in Qatar. , South Korean consular statistics showed 2,184 of their nationals or former nationals living in the country, a decrease of 7.7% since 2009. 1,383 lived in Doha, 467 in Mesaieed, and 334 in Al Khor. Five were Qatari nationals, 112 were international students, and the remaining 2,067 had other types of visas. In addition, an estimated 3,000 North Koreans lived in the country . This accounted for approximately 40% of the working population of North Korean in the Persian Gulf region at that time. North Korean workers are reported to be among the lowest paid in the country, earning US$170/month, less than even Nepali migrants; they perform low-skilled work such as plastering and bricklaying. Their lives are subject to a great deal of official constraint, and they try to avoid contact with the South Koreans. There were no registered schools for Korean nationals in Qatar . Saudi Arabia South Korea established diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia in 1962, and opened an embassy in Jeddah in 1973, which would later move to Riyadh. Labour relations were especially a source of friction in Saudi Arabia; one eyewitness account by an American expatriate claims that Hyundai's management called in the Saudi military to put down a strike at the Jubail port construction project, and that the army then proceeded to arrest and execute several workers. Korean workers were also not afforded the opportunity for much social contact with their host population, though a few did convert to Islam. Migration to the country would peak in 1982 and 1983, with over 122,000 South Koreans entering Saudi Arabia in each of those years, making up over 70% of Korean migration to the region. However, by 1985, the number of South Koreans entering Saudi Arabia had fallen to 58,924, paralleling a downward trend in the whole region. Saudi Arabia's first school for South Korean nationals was established in 1992 in Jeddah; , it enrolled a total of 23 children at the kindergarten level. In 1998, South Korea closed their consulate in Jeddah. There was no known North Korean presence, and North Korea does not maintain diplomatic relations with the kingdom. , South Korean government figures showed 2,821 of their nationals or former nationals in the country, up by about 40% from 2,014 in 2011. This made them the second-largest Korean population in the region, having surpassed the population in Qatar which shrank during the same period. 43 were Saudi nationals, 65 were international students, and the remaining 2,713 had other kinds of visas. 1,479 lived in Damman, 607 in Riyadh, 394 in Jeddah, 134 in Medina, 100 in Jizan, and 11 in 'Asir Province. There are two Korean international schools in Saudi Arabia: Korean International School of Jeddah (KISJ; ) and Korean School in Riyadh ().Home. Riyadh Korean School. Retrieved on 21 September 2015. United Arab Emirates Number of North Korean migrant workers in Asia The United Arab Emirates received a small contingent of Korean migrant workers in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but it was never a major destination. However, due to rapid growth since 2005, the country has come to have the Arab world's largest Korean population. , there were roughly 2,500 South Koreans living in Dubai alone, largely businessmen working at the 90 Korean companies which operated in the country. Rapid population growth continued through 2011; by that year, South Korean consular statistics showed 5,665 of their nationals or former nationals living in the UAE, giving it the region's largest South Korean population, with more than twice as large a population as that in Saudi Arabia. Five were Emirati nationals, fourteen were international students, and the rest had other types of visas. 3,276 lived in Dubai, 1,982 in Abu Dhabi, 141 in Sharjah, 83 in Ajman, 67 in Ras al-Khaimah, 36 in Fujairah, and 22 in Umm al-Quwain. Many South Koreans in the UAE are flight attendants working for Emirates Airlines; the number of Koreans working for Emirates Airlines increased from 15 in 1998 to 620 as of 2007, mostly based out of Dubai. Dubai has the UAE's largest community of South Koreans. However, a consulate was not opened in Dubai until March 2008. In Abu Dhabi, Reem Investments plans to develop a residential complex for South Korean expatriates on Al Reem Island, and have engaged Gansam Architects of Seoul to design its cultural centre. There are also believed to be roughly 1,300 North Korean workers in the UAE, primarily in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. They earn between US$300 and $500 per month, but have to make so-called \\"loyalty payments\\" of $150 to $250 to the North Korean government. This has sparked discontent among the workers; in response, the North Korean government has sent security agents to patrol North Korean work camps and keep an eye out for people making critical comments. In 2010, a branch of the Pyongyang Okryu Restaurant opened in Dubai, staffed by waitresses from North Korea; the restaurant earns hard currency to supplement the North Korean state budget. Other countries Other countries which received Korean migrant workers in the late 1970s and early 1980s include Yemen, Oman, and Sudan. There are Korean weekend schools in Mauritania (Nouadhibou), Morocco (Rabat and Agadir) and Tunisia (Tunis).

Kincaid Jr., known as Cliff Kincaid (born May 16, 1954), is an author and conservative political activist. He is the director of the Center for Investigative Journalism of Accuracy in Media, an organization which believes much of the American news media is biased toward liberal candidates and policy positions. Kincaid has written for such publications as Human Events, a former national weekly newspaper since converted to a website.  Background  Kincaid graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in journalism and communications from the University of Toledo in Toledo, Ohio. At his college newspaper, he won an award for editorial writing from the Society of Professional Journalists. Kincaid came to Washington, D.C., through the National Journalism Center headed by the late conservative author M. Stanton Evans. In addition to his work with A. I. M., Kincaid is the president of American Survival, Inc., a 501 (c) (3) organization for stated \\"educational\\" purposes, based in Owings, Maryland.  Accuracy in media  In November 2005, Kincaid, as the representative for Accuracy in Media, criticized the Fox News channel for the broadcast, The Heat is On, which reported, with a disclaimer, the threat of global warming. Kincaid argued that the program was one-sided and likened the broadcast to a \\"hostile takeover of Fox News\\" by the environmental lobby. Kincaid is a longtime critic of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama. According to the SPLC, Kincaid \\"masquerades as a media watchdog, [but] is actually an unrepentant propagandist for extremist right-wing causes who knows few boundaries in his attempts to smear liberal foes\\". Kincaid discounts the existence of gay conservatives, but claims \\"there is a homosexual movement that has its roots in Marxism and is characterized by anti-Americanism and hatred of Christian values.\\" On June 14, 2016, after the Orlando nightclub shooting, Kincaid penned the article \\"Why Obama Gets Emotional Talking about Islam.\\" This report claims that under President Barack Obama \\"the religion of a suspect is NOT to be judged or pursued when questions emerge about Muslims having links to terrorism. [...] [This] presidential approach [...] has cost many lives in Orlando and puts more lives at risk in the nation at large\\".  Television appearances  Kincaid sometimes substituted for co-host Pat Buchanan in the late 1980s on the former CNN television series, Crossfire, which offered debate on liberal v. conservative topics.

Designer Drugs: Past History and Future Prospects Journal of Forensic Sciences. 33(2): 569-575 (1988) depending on which isomer is used (with the cis isomers being the more potent ones).  Overview and history  3-Methylfentanyl was first discovered in 1974 and subsequently appeared on the street as an alternative to the clandestinely produced fentanyl analog Œ±-methylfentanyl. However, it quickly became apparent that 3-methylfentanyl was much more potent than Œ±-methylfentanyl, and correspondingly even more dangerous. While 3-methylfentanyl was initially sold on the black market for only a short time between 1984 and 1985, its high potency made it an attractive target to clandestine drug producers, as racemic 3-MF is 10‚Äì15 times more potent than fentanyl, and so correspondingly larger amounts of cut product for street sales can be produced for an equivalent amount of effort as for producing fentanyl itself; one gram of 3-methylfentanyl might be sufficient to produce several thousand dosage units once diluted for sale. 3-MF has thus reappeared several times, at various places around the world. The only country in the world with significant (200+ deaths a year, more than 10,000 addicts) abuse of this chemical is Estonia, where a dose of 3-MF costs 10 ‚Ç¨, and other opiates are not generally available since the end of the 2000s. Approximately 1100 deaths from fentanyl and 3-MF abuse were recorded in Estonia between 2005‚Äì2013, compared to approximately 450 deaths in Sweden, Germany, UK, Finland and Greece combined during the same period. Other opioid analogs even more potent still than 3-MF are known, such as carfentanil and ohmefentanyl, but these are significantly more difficult to manufacture than 3-methylfentanyl. Since 2016 fentanyl seizures in Estonia contains mostly carfentanil or cyclopropylfentanyl. 3-Methylfentanyl has similar effects to fentanyl, but is far more potent due to increased binding affinity to its target site. Since fentanyl itself is already highly potent, 3-methylfentanyl is extremely dangerous when used recreationally, and has resulted in many deaths among recreational opioid users ingesting the drug. Side effects of fentanyl analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression, which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear.  Use as chemical weapon  3-Methylfentanyl was also reported by media as the identity of the anaesthetic \\"gas\\" Kolokol-1 delivered as an aerosol during the Moscow theater hostage crisis in 2002 in which many hostages died from accidental overdoses, 3-methylfentanyl was later ruled out as the primary agent used. The opiate antidote naloxone was on-hand to treat the victims of the crisis, but, whether due to their incarceration, lack of food, or water, or sleep, or due to the novel nature of the still-unconfirmed compound used, acute symptoms continued to develop, resulting in many fatalities despite the administration of naloxone. Synthesis A number of methods for synthesis have been published. The most recent is probably the method posted by the Serbian chemical society (2004). There is another method, though, for constructing the N-Benzyl-3-methyl-4-piperidone in a 2-stage Michael reaction, followed by Dieckmann cyclization as per usual.

Bright's paternal grandfather, John Bright, was an ex-slave who had been liberated off a slave ship with his mother in 1823. Bright was educated at the Wesleyan Boys' High School in Freetown (1898‚Äì1904), and then studied medicine at Edinburgh University (1905‚Äì10), before setting up a practice in Freetown. At Edinburgh, he became \\"politically awake\\" and was involved in a number of student activist debates and policies. In November 1911 he married Addah Maude, daughter of former legislative council member T. Colenso Bishop, and they eventually had four children. Political career In 1918, Bright set up the Aurora newspaper, which he edited until 1925. In 1920, he was a founder member of the National Congress of British West Africa, and was elected to the Legislative Council in 1924. In 1925 he inspired Ladipo Solanke's formation of the West African Students' Union, becoming a founder member. With Ernest Beoku-Betts, he campaigned for increased suffrage and against racism, without success. In 1939, following a feud with Isaac Wallace-Johnson, Bright supported government measures to limit the activities of Johnson's Youth Leagues. This alienated many of Bright's supporters, and he temporarily stepped down from politics. In the 1940s, Bright founded the National Council of Sierra Leone, and it became the main opposition at the 1951 Sierra Leonean general election. After spending the next six years attempting to obstruct all government activities, the National Council lost all its seats at the 1957 election. Legacy Professor Akintola J. G. Wyse wrote a biography of H. C. Bankole-Bright that was dedicated to the author's family and his late sister, Lerina Taylor-Bright.

By 2009 WTMG began to evolve to a Rhythmic direction with a heavy emphasis on hit-driven Hip-Hop/R&B.; Because of this shift, Nielsen BDS placed the station on the Rhythmic Airplay panel.

It is a volumetric measurement of cubic capacity. It estimated the tonnage of a ship based on length and maximum beam. It is expressed in \\"tons burden\\" (, ), and abbreviated \\"tons bm\\". The formula is: : \\\\text{Tonnage} = \\\\frac {(\\\\text{Length}- (\\\\text{Beam}\\\\times\\\\frac{3} {5})) \\\\times \\\\text{Beam} \\\\times \\\\frac {\\\\text{Beam}}{2}} {94} where: * Length is the length, in feet, from the stem to the sternpost; * Beam is the maximum beam, in feet. The Builder's Old Measurement formula remained in effect until the advent of steam propulsion. Steamships required a different method of estimating tonnage, because the ratio of length to beam was larger and a significant volume of internal space was used for boilers and machinery. In 1849, the Moorsom System was created in the United Kingdom. The Moorsom system calculates the cargo- carrying capacity in cubic feet, another method of volumetric measurement. The capacity in cubic feet is then divided by 100 cubic feet of capacity per gross ton, resulting in a tonnage expressed in tons. History and derivation King Edward I levied the first tax on the hire of ships in England in 1303 based on tons burthen. Later, King Edward III levied a tax of 3 shillings on each \\"tun\\" of imported wine, equal to ¬£ today (using the last year of Edward III's reign, 1377, as the base year). At that time a \\"tun\\" was a wine container of 252 gallons weighing about , a weight known today as a long ton or imperial ton. In order to estimate the capacity of a ship in terms of 'tun' for tax purposes, an early formula used in England was: : \\\\text{Tonnage} = \\\\frac {\\\\text{Length}\\\\times \\\\text{Beam} \\\\times \\\\text{Depth}} {100} where: * Length is the length (undefined), in feet * Beam is the beam, in feet. * Depth is the depth of the hold, in feet below the main deck. The numerator yields the ship's volume expressed in cubic feet. If a \\"tun\\" is deemed to be equivalent to 100 cubic feet, then the tonnage is simply the number of such 100 cubic feet 'tun' units of volume. * 100 the divisor is unitless, so tonnage would be expressed in 'ft¬≥ of tun'. In 1678 Thames shipbuilders used a method assuming that a ship's burden would be 3/5 of its displacement. Since tonnage is calculated by multiplying length √ó beam √ó draft √ó block coefficient, all divided by 35 ft¬≥ per ton of seawater, the resulting formula would be: : \\\\text{Tonnage} = \\\\frac {\\\\text{Length}\\\\times \\\\text{Beam} \\\\times \\\\frac {\\\\text{Beam}}{2} \\\\times \\\\frac {3}{5}\\\\times {0.62}} {35} where: * Draft is estimated to be half of the beam. * Block coefficient is based on an assumed average of 0.62. * 35 ft¬≥ is the volume of one ton of sea water. Or by solving : : \\\\text{Tonnage} = \\\\frac {\\\\text{Length}\\\\times\\\\text{Beam} \\\\times \\\\frac \\\\text{Beam}{2}} {94} In 1694 a new British law required that tonnage for tax purposes be calculated according to a similar formula: : \\\\text{Tonnage} = \\\\frac {\\\\text{Length}\\\\times\\\\text{Beam} \\\\times \\\\text{Depth}} {94} This formula remained in effect until the Builder's Old Measurement rule (above) was put into use in 1720, and then mandated by Act of Parliament in 1773. Depth * Depth to deck :The height from the underside of the hull, excluding the keel itself, at the ship's midpoint, to the top of the uppermost full length deck. * Depth in hold :Interior space; The height from the lowest part of the hull inside the ship, at its midpoint, to the ceiling that is made up of the uppermost full length deck. For old warships it is to the ceiling that is made up of the lowermost full length deck. * Main deck :Main deck, that is used in context of depth measurement, is usually defined as the uppermost full length deck. For the 16th century ship Mary Rose, main deck is the second uppermost full length deck. In a calculation of the tonnage of Mary Rose the draft was used instead of the depth. American tons burthen The British took the length measurement from the outside of the stem to the outside of the sternpost; the Americans measured from inside the posts. The British measured breadth from outside the planks, whereas the American measured the breadth from inside the planks. Lastly, the British divided by 94, whereas the Americans divided by 95. The upshot was that American calculations gave a lower number than the British. For instance, when the British measured the captured , their calculations gave her a burthen of 1533 tons, whereas the American calculations gave the burthen as 1444 tons.Henderson, James, CBE (1994) The Frigates: An account of the lighter warships of the Napoleonic Wars, 1793-1815. (London:Leo Cooper), p.167. The British measure yields values about 6% greater than the American. The US system was in use from 1789 until 1864, when a modified version of the Moorsom System was adopted.

It was formed in 1983 by singer/bassist Paulo Ricardo, keyboardist Luiz Schiavon, guitarist Fernando Deluqui and drummer Paulo Ant√¥nio \\"P.A.\\" Pagni. RPM played soft techno-pop with strong, paradoxical influences from progressive rock and European synthpop. Their lyrics were pessimistic and ironic, and full of literary allusions to the likes of Arthur Rimbaud, Surrealism and Christiane F., and political references. The band was very successful in the mid-1980s, being considered the Rolling Stones of Brazil. Their live album R√°dio Pirata ao vivo was the best-selling Brazilian record ever, with more than 3 million copies sold. The group's success was not limited to CD sales. RPM starred a phenomenon that was compared to Beatlemania, with enthusiastic fans filling stadiums, stopping traffic, evading security, and buying any products with the RPM brand. After two years the band took a break, but returned in 1988 with the album 4 Coiotes. It had a mix of progressive, jazz and dark sounds, and sold more than 300,000 copies ‚Äì a good number, but far from what was expected. Problems involving individual egos and drugs started to increase, and at the end of the tour the band could not agree about the sound of the next album. The tension between members killed the band in 1988. Paulo Ricardo, however, tried to revive the band a few times in the following years. In the early 1990s, he and Deluqui put together a new band under the name \\"Paulo Ricardo & RPM\\", this time trying a harder rock style to fit the trend of the time. With no significant commercial success, the project failed. However, in 2002 the original lineup reunited for a very successful tour and live album, MTV RPM 2002. The album was a reinterpretation of the successful songs of the 1980s, plus five new tracks, including a Brazilian version of the reality show \\"Big Brother Brazil\\", which was considered by the Big Brother world director as the best theme of all the countries involved in the franchise. Shortly after, the band split once again because of personal differences. In 2011, Paulo Ricardo posted on Twitter that RPM would return. The band recorded a new album called Elektra, on two CDs. One CD contained remixes ‚Äì RPM was the first band in Brazil to record a remix of the 80's smash hit \\"Louras Geladas\\". The record was released in December 2011 with a paradoxical song like an electronic rock album, where the synthesizer has a fundamental place. The lyrics were more mature than those of 1980's, with themes like the Elektra complex, night life and seduction and media influence, but there was also a romantic ballad. The album was well received. The group's \\"Elektra\\" tour during 2012 encompassed Brazil and some cities in Argentina. In 2013 the band planned to record a DVD of the tour, including tracks from the Elektra album, successful songs from its entire career, and a reinterpretation of Pink Floyd's \\"Wish You Were Here\\". On 22 June 2019, the band's drummer, , died at the age of 61 from pulmonary fibrosis.

Rugby league career Kennedy signed for South Sydney for the start of the 1939 New South Wales Rugby League premiership where he quickly cemented his place in the sides starting thirteen and became known as 'The Mighty Atom' or 'The Little Bully' because of his small stature, rough play and ability. He served during the Second World War from 1941 to 1944 before returning to the Rabbitohs where his performances earned him a call up to the New South Wales side in late 1945 and the following year earned his debut cap for the Australian side even though his club failed to earn a victory in the entire season; further international honors eluded him however due to a string of injuries. Kennedy later moved to the country where he would go on to play for Cessnock where his performances would warrant him selection in the Country side in 1947. He would move back to Sydney and play a season for Newtown before again heading back to the country and finishing his career with Grenfell.

History The Big Muddy Badlands were home to outlaws such as Butch Cassidy, Sundance Kid, Sam Kelley and Dutch Henry which came to Canada, across the border to escape from the U.S. marshalls. Bengough was the western terminus of the Radville - Bengough CNR rail line in 1924. It is still situated on the CPR/CN Railway. Glasnevin near the northern terminus of route 34 was located on the Assiniboia Branch CPR rail line. This east-west route connected Weyburn and Altawan continuing westerly into Alberta to Manyberries. These rail junctions and highways combined to serve communities and industries in the area.

The play has been called \\"the finest of the more serious tragicomedies\\" of Massinger.Philip Edwards, quoted in: Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The Later Jacobean and Caroline Dramatists: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1978; p. 101. Performance and publication The Bondman was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 3 December 1623, as The Noble Bondman, and was acted by the Lady Elizabeth's Men at the Cockpit Theatre, and also performed for the Court at Whitehall Palace. The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 12 March the following year, 1624, and published soon after in a quarto printed by Edward Allde for the booksellers John Harrison and Edward Blackmore. A second quarto appearing in 1638. Massinger dedicated the play to Philip Herbert, then the Earl of Montgomery and later Earl of Pembroke and Lord Chancellor. Massinger had an important and long- standing connection with the Herbert family through his father. (The play was a \\"modest success...in untying the purse strings of Philip Herbert\\" and winning Massinger some patronage support.)Alexander Samson, The Spanish Match: Prince Charles's Journey to Madrid, 1623, London, Ashgate, 2006; p. 158. The drama proved popular in its own era and long after. William Cartwright depended heavily upon it when writing his own drama The Royal Slave (1636). The Bondman was revived during the Restoration era; in the first years of the 1660s it was performed repeatedly by several companies, Killigrew's King's Company, Davenant's Duke's Company, John Rhodes's troupe, and perhaps George Jolly's too.James G. McManaway, \\"Philip Massinger and the Restoration Drama,\\" Journal of English Literary History, Vol. 1 No. 3 (December 1934), pp. 276‚Äì304; see p. 287. Samuel Pepys saw the play in 1661, and praised Thomas Betterton's performance as Pisander. Betterton played the role at Drury Lane as late as 1719. Richard Cumberland produced an adaptation that was staged at Covent Garden in 1769. Later, a segment of Act I, scene iii was abstracted for its patriotic message and distributed as a broadside prior to the expected invasion of Napoleon.James Phelan, On Philip Massinger, Halle, E. Karras, 1878; pp. 53‚Äì4. Sources The play tells the story of Timoleon and his defence of Syracuse against Carthage in 338 BC. Massinger's primary source for his plot was the treatment of Timoleon in the Parallel Lives of Plutarch, though he also drew upon works by Herodotus, Justin, and Seneca the Elder.Philip Edwards, \\"The Sources of Massinger's The Bondman,\\" Review of English Studies Vol. 15 (1964), pp. 21‚Äì26. Massinger's play includes an approving treatment of the assassination of Timoleon's older brother Timophanes for tyranny ‚Äî surprising and noteworthy, given the absolutist political era in which the play appeared. Critics have debated whether and to what degree Massinger's play was a commentary on the political climate of his own era, and its possible status as an intended work of propaganda.Ira Clark, The Moral Art of Philip Massinger, Lewisburg, PA, Bucknell University Press, 1993; pp. 125‚Äì7.Samson, pp. 157‚Äì8. Synopsis The play is set in ancient Syracuse (though in typical Jacobean manner, Massinger gives his characters contemporaneous dress and manners: the ancient Syracusans wear ruffs around their necks and behave like Jacobeans). On the eve of a Carthaginian invasion, the citizens of the city have invited Timoleon from Corinth to command their defensive effort. Timoleon is welcomed by prominent Syracusans, including Archidamus, his son Timagoras, and his daughter Cleora. Leosthenes, a friend of Timagoras, is Cleora's suitor (though not her only one). In the play's early scenes, Massinger presents a picture of Syracuse as a deeply corrupt society. Cleon, a rich citizen, is a selfish glutton; the mature women are sexually rapacious, one even attempting to seduce her own stepson; and the city's slaves are badly abused. Members of the younger generation, however, are hungry for the reform that Timoleon's arrival promises. Leosthenes is a valiant but insecure and jealous young man; when he takes his leave of Cleora, he expresses his jealousy, and Cleora, resentful of his mistrust of her virtue, vows to wear a blindfold and to remain mute until Leosthenes returns from the war. Timoleon organizes the citizens' military forces and marches them out of the city ‚Äî and the city's slaves ready for revolt. They are led by Pisander, a gentleman from Thebes who is masquerading as Marullo, a slave in Archidamus's household. The ensuing slave revolt is managed by Pisander so that the citizens, while treated roughly, are not slaughtered; it turns out that Pisander's motive in starting the revolt is to further his own suit for Cleora's hand in marriage. Aided by Cleora's personal slave Timandra, Pisander pleads his suit to the blindfolded and mute Cleora, and so effectively that she is touched by his appeal. The forces under Timoleon are victorious over the Carthaginians; but when they march home in triumph, they find the slaves in charge of the city and the gates closed against them. Their assault on the city fails; but when the slaves venture out to attack them, the masters manage to terrify the slaves with their whips and overcome the resistance. Once they re-take the city, the Syracusans round up the rebellious slaves, including Pisander/Marullo; but Cleora causes a scandal by taking his part, against the vocal opposition of Leosthenes and Timagoras. In a trial before Timoleon, Cleora pleads her case, and Pisander reveals his true identity as a prominent, well-known, well-respected Theban noble; it is also revealed that Cleora's slave Timandra is actually Pisander's sister Statilia. Leosthenes had previously been engaged to marry Statilia, but had turned his back on her. In the play's denouement, Pisander and Cleora and Leosthenes and Statilia are united as couples, and the rebel slaves are re-absorbed into a more humanely ordered Syracusan society.

Early life and marriage She was the daughter of Major-General Sir Charles Bruce, KCB, sometime Governor of Portsmouth, and his wife Charlotte, daughter of James Forbes, of Hutton Hall, Essex, and Kingairloch, Argyll. She married the future Prime Minister on 13 September 1860, at All Souls Church, Langham Place, London. In early married life, her parties in Grosvenor Square, London were regarded as events of importance, and during the winter at Belmont Castle, Meigle, Perthshire she and her husband received their friends and neighbours for many years. She guided and influenced her husband throughout their marriage to a considerable degree. Intelligent and cultured, she speedily mastered many subjects and was an instinctively shrewd judge of character. Sir Henry discussed with her all the crises which arose in his political life, and she became closely associated with all her husband's plans, jealously guarding his interests and resenting the least supposed slight to his reputation. Her aspirations for his success compensated for his lack of ambition. Years later he told John Morley that Charlotte's contentment was more important to him than his life. However, she was content to remain comparatively unknown, appearing on few public platforms and taking no open part in her husband's electioneering campaigns. In 1884, Sir Henry accepted the Chief Secretaryship for Ireland only at her urging, despite Rosebery writing to tell him it was \\"the most disagreeable post in the public service\\". Personal life and death Lady Campbell-Bannerman, described as a rather plain, stout woman, was well-versed in art, and the couple frequently spent their holidays in visiting their old ch√¢teaux of France. Belmont, their much-loved Scottish home, was full of ancient French furniture and curios obtained during their frequent visits to the Continent. She spoke French fluently and, like her husband, was well-versed in French literature. She was very fond of Belmont, and in her later years was wheeled about the beautiful grounds in her bath chair. Fruit, flowers, and vegetables were regularly sent south during her residence in London, and a choice bloom of her favourite flower, a white gardenia, was posted to her daily. At Belmont, she and the prime minister walked together in the grounds when state duties permitted him some breathing space, and the evenings were spent quietly in her boudoir. Physically the couple, both reportedly enormous eaters, each weighed nearly in later years. Lady Campbell- Bannerman, who had no children, was racked by illness in the last years of her life. She had to curtail her social duties and her role as adviser to her husband. She was too ill to take her place by his side when he attained the prime ministership, although she was able to join him when he retired to Belmont after his 1906 election victory, taking part in the welcome which had been organised by his aides and constituents. He thought of taking time out of his political activity to be with her, but she dissuaded him from this, and early in 1906 they left their Belgrave Square town house to move into 10 Downing Street. As her illness grew increasingly painful and debilitating, her husband nursed her with tender care and anxious devotion through every crisis. He readily acknowledged to the King's Private Secretary, Sir Francis Knollys, that the time and energy he constantly gave to his wife meant that he neglected his prime-ministerial duties. He knew this was not right, but he could do no other. She hardly ever left 10 Downing Street, except for a visit to Dover in May, which left her with an attack of influenza. On 8 August, shortly after the House of Commons adjourned for the summer recess, the couple left for Marienbad, where Lady Campbell-Bannerman died in her sleep at 5 pm on 30 August 1906, her husband by her side; the immediate cause of death was exhaustion, as she had taken no food for three days. Two days later, a funeral was held for her, attended by King Edward VII, and she was buried in Meigle churchyard on 5 September. As a sign of his devotion, the prime minister had inscribed on his wife's memorial tablet in Meigle church the following words of Tasso's: \\"their hearts were as one\\". The death of his beloved wife was a severe blow to the Prime Minister, from which he never fully recovered, emotionally or physically. Shortly after Charlotte's death, he suffered the first of a series of progressively more serious and damaging heart attacks. Each time he appeared to have made a rapid and full recovery, but a particularly sharp and debilitating one came in November 1907. He resigned the following April and died later that month, less than two years after his wife.

Today, it is used as an ethnic slur for ethnic Russians from Russia proper by Ukrainians, Belarusians and Poles in their respective countries. The term is generally considered to be derogatory or condescending and reciprocal to the term khokhol for Ukrainians, as used by Russians. Another Ukrainian ethnic slur for Russians is katsap, meaning bearded.  History and etymology  Moskals destroy Kiev\\", illustration from a 1934 history textbook referring to the destruction of Kiev in 1169) Initially, as early as the 12th century, moskal referred to the residents of \\"Moscovia\\", the word literally translating as \\"Muscovite\\" (differentiating the residents of the Grand Duchy of Moscow from other East Slavs such as people from White Ruthenia (Belarusians), Red Ruthenia (Galicians) and others). With time, the word became an archaism in all the East Slavic languages, and survived only as a family name in each of those languages‚Äîsee below.Edyta M. Bojanowska (2007) \\"Nikolai Gogol: Between Ukrainian And Russian Nationalism\\" , p. 55: \\"In the 'low', folksy world of the provincial narrators, a Russian is a moskal (\\"Muscovite\\")\\", a foreigner and an intruder, at best a carpetbagger, at worst a thief in league with the devil.\\" The negative connotation, however, came in around the late 18th-early 19th centuries in the form of an ethnic slur labelling all Russians. At that time, soldiers of the Imperial Russian Army (and later those of the Soviet Army) stationed in parts of present-day Ukraine and Poland became known as moskale. Cultural influence \\"Moskal\\" is a stock character of the traditional Ukrainian puppet theatre form, vertep. Moskaliki is a Ukrainian designation for small fish typically used as bait or as a casual snack. It also gave rise to a number of East Slavic family names.

The best example of this concept can be found in Nietzsche's The Will to Power: Opposition to Schopenhauer Walter Kaufmann wrote that Nietzsche \\"celebrates the Greeks who, facing up to the terrors of nature and history, did not seek refuge in \\"a Buddhistic negation of the will,\\" as Schopenhauer did, but instead created tragedies in which life is affirmed as beautiful in spite of everything.\\"Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \\"Friedrich Nietzsche,\\" vol. 5, Macmillan, New York, 1967, p. 507.Original German: \\"buddhistischen Verneinung des Willens\\" (Nietzsche, Die Geburt der Trag√∂die aus dem Geiste der Musik, ¬ß 7). Schopenhauer‚Äôs negation of the will was a saying \\"no\\" to life and to the world, which he judged to be a scene of pain and evil. \\"[D]irectly against Schopenhauer‚Äôs place as the ultimate nay-sayer to life, Nietzsche positioned himself as the ultimate yes-sayer‚Ä¶.\\"A Companion to Schopenhauer, edited by Bart Vandenabeele, Part IV, ch. 19, article by Ken Gemes and Christopher Janaway, \\"Life-Denial versus Life-Affirmation: Schopenhauer and Nietzsche on Pessimism and Asceticism,\\" Blackwell, New York, 2012, p. 289 Nietzsche's affirmation of life's pain and evil, in opposition to Schopenhauer, resulted from an overflow of life.\\"I was the first to see the actual contrast: the degenerate instinct which turns upon life with a subterranean lust of vengeance (Christianity, Schopenhauer's philosophy, and in some respects too even Plato's philosophy ‚Äî in short, the whole of idealism in its typical forms), as opposed to a formula of the highest yea-saying to life, born of an abundance and a superabundance of life ‚Äî a yea-saying free from all reserve, applying even to suffering, and guilt, and all that is questionable and strange in existence.\\" (Nietzsche, Ecce Homo, The Birth of Tragedy, ¬ß 2) Schopenhauer's advocacy of self-denial and negation of life was, according to Nietzsche, very harmful.\\"For me the issue was the value of morality‚Äîand in that matter I had to take issue almost alone with my great teacher Schopenhauer‚Ä¶. The most specific issue was the worth of the 'unegoistic,' the instinct for pity, self-denial, self-sacrifice, something which Schopenhauer himself had painted with gold, deified, and projected into the next world for so long that it finally remained for him 'value in itself' and the reason why he said No to life and even to himself. But a constantly more fundamental suspicion of these very instincts voiced itself in me, a scepticism which always dug deeper! It was precisely here that I saw the great danger to humanity, its most sublime temptation and seduction.\\" (Nietzsche, Ecce Homo, \\"Why I Write Such Good Books,\\" \\"The Birth of Tragedy,\\" ¬ß 2.) For his entire mature life, Nietzsche was concerned with the damage that he thought resulted from Schopenhauerian disgust with life and turning against the world. Derridean interpretation Jacques Derrida allocates this concept and applies it specifically to language, its structure and play. This application acknowledges that there is, in fact, no center or origin within language and its many parts, no firm ground from which to base any Truth or truths. This shock allows for two reactions in Derrida's philosophy: the more negative, melancholic response, which he designates as Rousseauistic, or the more positive Nietzschean affirmation. Rousseau's perspective focuses on deciphering the truth and origin of language and its many signs, an often exhaustive occupation. Derrida's response to Nietzsche, however, offers an active participation with these signs and arrives at, in Derridean philosophy, a more resolute response to language. In \\"Structure, Sign, and Play\\", Derrida articulates Nietzsche's perspective as: > ... the joyous affirmation of the play of the world and of the innocence of > becoming, the affirmation of a world of signs without fault, without truth, > and without origin which is offered to an active interpretation.Derrida, > Jacques. \\"Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Humanities.\\" > Writing and Difference. Trans. Alan Bass. Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1978. > 278‚Äì293. Essentially, Derrida not only fosters Nietzsche's work but evolves it within the sphere of language; in doing so, Derrida acquires and employs Nietzsche's optimism in his concept of play: \\"the substitution of given and existing, present, pieces\\" (292). Much of this spirit resides in the abandonment of any sort of new humanism. This acceptance of the inevitable allows for considerable relief‚Äîevident in the designation of the loss of center as a non- center‚Äîas well as the opportunity to affirm and cultivate play, which enables humanity and the humanities \\"to pass beyond man and humanism\\" (292).

On December 1, 2010 WZCC began simulcasting with WLQH AM 940 in Chiefland. In August 2013 WZCC began broadcasting on an FM translator W227AV 93.3 MHz in Newberry; though licensed to Newberry in western Alachua County, the translator did not serve that community, covering instead an area between Chiefland and Fanning Springs from a transmitter along U.S. 19/98 north of Chiefland.

Exceptions may be made for hunting knives, pocket knives, and knives used for work-related purposes (chef's knives, etc.), depending upon the laws of a given jurisdiction. In turn, the carrying or possessing of certain type of knives perceived as deadly or offensive weapons such as automatic or switchblade knives or butterfly knives may be restricted or prohibited. Even where knives may be legally carried on the person generally, this right may not extend to all places and circumstances, and knives of any description may be prohibited at schools, public buildings or courthouses, and at public events. Austria In accordance with the Austrian Arms Act of 1996 (Waffengesetz 1996) it is illegal to buy, import, possess or carry weapons that are disguised as another object or as an object of common use (sword canes, e.g., or knives disguised as ink pens, brush handles or belt buckles).Waffengesetz 1996 ¬ß 17 (1): \\"Verboten sind der Erwerb, die Einfuhr, der Besitz, und das F√ºhren: 1. von Waffen, deren Form geeignet ist, einen anderen Gegenstand vorzut√§uschen, oder die mit Gegenst√§nden des t√§glichen Gebrauches verkleidet sind.\\" For ordinary knives, however, there are no restrictions or prohibitions based on blade length or opening or locking mechanism.Waffengesetz (1996) The Arms Act defines weapons as \\"objects that by their very nature are intended to reduce or eliminate the defensive ability of a person through direct impact\\", specifically including all firearms.

This discretion extends to even folding knives without a locking blade. Bulgaria Bulgarian weapon law is maintained on a yearly basis. It is called ZOBVVPI (Bulgarian: –ó–∞–∫–æ–Ω –∑–∞ –æ—Ä—ä–∂–∏—è—Ç–∞, –±–æ–µ–ø—Ä–∏–ø–∞—Å–∏—Ç–µ, –≤–∑—Ä–∏–≤–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –≤–µ—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –∏ –ø–∏—Ä–æ—Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ –∏–∑–¥–µ–ª–∏—è) and it covers ONLY the possession and usage of firearms (including gas and signal ones), and pellet or BB (Bulgarian: —Å–∞—á–º–∏) pneumatic guns. A state regulation on melee weapons of any kind does not exist, whether knives, swords, bats or electric devices. Neither there is a juridical definition on the terms \\"melee weapon\\" or \\"cold weapon\\" in any Bulgarian law. Hence it is absolutely legal to possess and carry a knife in Bulgaria without having to procure any reason for doing so. Concealed knife carry is OK, anywhere and anytime. Although there are no restrictions on the possession or carrying of any type of knives or swords, it is not widely accepted or considered appropriate to carry a knife openly in public places such as streets or public buildings, stores or restaurants. In urban areas, expect an instant check and hassle if a policeman sees you to openly carry a larger knife, even if you have legal right to do it. From a society point of view, the open carry of knives in Bulgaria is justified only on rural areas, when fishing or hunting, or when the knife serves as a tool in work activities, such as gardening. Some places like courts, banks, clubs, bars, etc. will deny you the access with any type of weapon (knives included) and most of them don't offer a safekeeping option. It is urban legend in Bulgaria that knives above are illegal to carry on person, so expect the police to try to convince you give up the knife voluntarily, even if such measure is illegal. You should not give up your knife, instead state the purpose of \\"daily needs\\", \\"utility usage\\" or even \\"self-defense\\" for carrying and be clear that you haven't committed any crime. Insist the policeman to cite a law against you carrying a knife in public. Since there is not any such law in Bulgaria, police most likely will let you keep your knife and send you on your way with a \\"warning\\". If they insist or are further misbehaving, ask to contact their superior officer prior to giving up your knife or else you will not see it again. Actually, there are some random city councils which try to limit knife lengths above with issuing acts, but these acts are all illegal and have no compliance force, because the councils serve only administrative functions and they don't have the jurisdiction to invent or impose laws of any kind. Remember that although very liberal in terms of knives (weapons) possession and carry, compared to many European countries, Bulgaria is not the place where you can defend yourself with deadly force. If the need for self- defense with a knife ever arises, consider it very carefully. Bulgaria has strong restrictive self-defense laws and a \\"duty to retreat\\" is always obligatory. Usually, courts often consider the armed self-defense as \\"unjustified\\" based on the Penal Code and the defending side ends up with an effective jail verdict, even if the cause (treat) for initiating self-defense is proven. Canada The Canadian Criminal Code criminalizes the possession of knives which open automatically. Section 84(1) defines \\"a knife that has a blade that opens automatically by gravity or centrifugal force or by hand pressure applied to a button, spring or other device attached to or in the handle of the knife\\" as a prohibited weapon. Only persons who have been granted exemption by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police through the Canadian Firearms Program are allowed to possess (but not acquire) prohibited weapons. If a person is found in unauthorized possession of a prohibited knife by any law enforcement officer, the person is liable to a maximum of 5 years in jail and the weapon being seized. The Crown can then apply to a Provincial Court judge for the weapon to be forfeited and destroyed. The import and export of prohibited weapons is also strictly regulated and enforced by the Canada Border Services Agency.Canada Border Services Agency: Importing a Firearm or Weapon Into Canada. Examples of prohibited knives include: * any knife, including a switchblade, or butterfly knife with a blade that opens automatically by gravity or centrifugal force or by hand pressure applied to a button, spring or other device in or attached to the handle of the knife; * Constant Companion (belt-buckle knife); * finger rings with blades or other sharp objects projecting from the surface; * push daggers.Canada Border Services Agency: Importing a Firearm or Weapon Into Canada - Prohibited Weapons and Devices Manually-opened or 'one-handed' opening knives, including spring-assisted knives, that do not fall within the categories listed as prohibited weapons definition are legal to own and use, however importation of many of these items has been banned by the CBSA.Canada Border Services Agency, Customs Notice 18-01, Notification of Canadian International Trade Tribunal Decision on Centrifugal Opening Knives There is no length restriction on carrying knives within the Criminal Code, but there is a prohibition against carrying a knife if the possessor intends to carry for a purpose dangerous to public peace or for the purpose of committing a criminal offense. China Due to concerns about potential violence at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China began restricting \\"dangerous knives\\", requiring that purchasers register with the government when purchasing these knives. Included in the new restrictions are knives with \\"blood grooves\\", lockblade knives, knives with blades measuring over in length, and knives with blades over in length also having a point angle of less than 60 degrees. Czech Republic Czech weapon law from the year 2002 concerns firearms only, with no other legislation concerning knives in existence (with the exception of the paragraphs of the penal code penalizing the use of any weapons in criminal offenses). This means there are no restrictions on the possession or carrying of any types of knives or swords, whether openly or in concealed manner. Denmark Owning a knife: Legal knives: In Denmark, folding knives (pocket knives) and fixed-blade knives are legal to own, if the blade is no longer than . Blades over this length may only be legally owned, if the possessor has a legitimate reason for owning the knife (knives for cooking at home, knife used as a tool, an especially designed knife for hunting, a butcher's knife and so on) or a special collector's permit. Illegal knives: All knives with blades that may be opened with one hand (even if the one-hand opening mechanism has been removed), automatic-opening knives (switchblades), push daggers, gravity knives, disguised knives (belt-buckle knife, sword cane, etc.), knives with two-parted handles (butterfly knives), knives with ready access by the wearer (neck or belt knives, boot knives, etc.) are illegal to own or possess. Multi- tools featuring one-hand opening blades are also illegal to own or possess.Lang, Oliver, Messer in Europa: Mit Dem Messer Auf Reisen, √úbersicht ‚Äì Messer & Recht im Ausland, Messer Magasin (March 2010) Owning throwing knives and throwing in private or public is subject to permissions.European Throwing Association \\"Flying Blades\\", Legal Situation of Knife Throwing in Denmark, retrieved October 2014. Carrying a knife: Any legal knife (including a tiny pocket knife) is ILLEGAL to carry in public, unless *1) used for work (craftsmen's tools) *2) used for accepted leisure activity , such as during hunting, fishing, hiking, sailing, outdoor picnic, girl/boy scouting or other accepted leisure activity. The knife should be appropriate for the task - (a hunting knife only for hunting - and a boy scout can not carry a butcher's knife) also you have to convincingly prove to the police, that you actually are on your way to an accepted leisure activity (no good to claim that you are going on a picnic, if you do not carry food, beverage and a blanket for it) The knife should be carried directly to and from the job or activity - preferable in a toolbox in a locked car/trunk for craftsmen, or (out of direct acces) in a bag/luggage for leisure activities. * Carrying a legal knife is aggravated illegal in nightlife, as a spectator at sport events, during demonstrations and mass gatherings - such as concerts/festivals, and other situations where you are likely to be drunk/intoxicated or excited. * Carrying an illegal knife in public is a very severe offence Sanctions - for violating the above mentioned legislation for carrying a knife in public - are in most cases only fines (normally 3000 DKK or more) - but in case of repeated illegal knife carrying or for aggravated illegal knife carrying, you might go to jail (most often 40 days - but maximum is 2 years). Danish police, army, state authorities and the Royal Court of the Kingdom of Denmark are exempt from this legislation. France In France, any knife of any blade length with a fixed blade, or a folding blade with a locking system, falls into unregulated Category D weapon (armes de cat√©gorie D en vente libre).There are two sub- categories within \\"cat√©gorie D\\": the unregulated D Category weapons and the regulated D category weapons; see'Arme de cat√©gorie D (en vente libre ou soumise √† enregistrement)', www.service-public.fr website, accessed on May 10, 2017 'Loi n¬∞ 2012-304 du 6 mars 2012 relative √† l‚Äô√©tablissement d‚Äôun contr√¥le des armes modernes, simplifi√© et pr√©ventif' Unregulated category D weapons may be legally purchased if over 18 years of age, but they may not be carried on one's person, unless carried \\"for good reason\\", for example, as part of the tools of one's profession. If carried in a vehicle, such knives must be placed in a secure, locked compartment not accessible to the vehicle occupants. In addition, French law provides that authorities may classify any knife as a prohibited item depending upon circumstances and the discretion of the police or judicial authorities. Since \\"reasonable size\\" knives are merely tolerated in most circumstances, authorities may summarily confiscate it.Loi relative aux couteaux et port d'arme ‚Äì mise √† jour octobre 2013, site www.knivesandtools.fr/, consult√© le 11 mai 2017 Germany German knife law establishes three categories of knives: 1) prohibited knives; 2) knives designated as cutting and thrusting weapons; and 3) other knives. Some knives are additionally classified as restricted-use, in that they may be possessed in the home or business, but may not be carried on the person.Die Rechtslage ‚Äì WaffG und Messer , retrieved 27 August 2011 In addition, paragraph 42 section 5 of the Weapons Act gives each German state the option in certain areas to enact local regulations prohibiting the carrying of weapons \\"and any dangerous objects\\" in so-called \\"weapons ban\\" areas for purposes of protecting public safety and order. \\"Weapons ban\\" areas have been enacted in Berlin and Hamburg. Cutting and thrusting weapons Knives designated as cutting and thrusting weapons, but not otherwise specifically prohibited may be possessed by persons of 18 years and older. German law defines a cutting and thrusting weapon as any object intended to reduce or eliminate the ability of a person to attack another person or to defend themselves. This includes swords, sabers, daggers, stilettos, and bayonets. For example, as a bayonet is a military weapon intended to injure or kill people, it is regarded as a weapon by the criminal law. In contrast, a machete is regarded as a tool to clear dense vegetation. Knives classed as cutting and thrusting weapons are generally restricted to possession and use on private property, and may not be carried in public or at certain public events. Restricted-use knives All knives that are not illegal may be legally purchased, owned, and used by anyone on private property. However, some knives are restricted from being carried in public, which is defined as exercising actual control of a restricted-class knife outside the home, business, or private property.OLG Stuttgart ¬∑ Beschluss vom 14. Juni 2011 ¬∑ Az. 4 Ss 137/11, retrieved 1 April 2015. * All cutting and thrusting weapons such as daggers, swords, or stilettos (see above). * All folding knives that have a one-handed opening mechanism and can be locked with only one hand (whether automatic, assisted-opening, or manual in nature). A knife that has only one of these two features may be legal to carry (provided it does not violate the principles below and above). * All knives with fixed blades over ¬ß 42a Verbot des F√ºhrens von Anscheinswaffen und bestimmten tragbaren Gegenst√§nden, retrieved 1 April 2015. Restricted-use knives may be carried if transported in a locked, sealed container, or if there is a commonly accepted legitimate purpose for carrying it, such as participation in a historical reenactment, sporting use (e.g. hunting), or as a necessary tool in a trade or business. The desire to defend oneself, or to use the knife as a tool without proof of necessity for its use is ordinarily not considered a legitimate purpose under the law. Greece It is illegal to carry a knife for use as a weapon in attack or defense. The only general restriction is intended use, not the properties of the knife itself (in particular, there is no restriction of blade length, despite popular belief). However, in practice there will be significant leeway for interpretation for police officers and judges ‚Äì and much will depend on whether an intended use other than as a weapon can be argued ‚Äì for which the properties of the knife in question will be very relevant (bad: flick-knife, automated, long blade, neck-knife, tactical). So, carrying a knife that has its main use as a weapon will be illegal. In addition, it is not allowed to carry knives in certain places, such as courtrooms, to football matches, etc. Carrying knives is generally very unusual in towns, but not in the countryside. ;Law 2168/1993 on weapons, explosives, etc. \\"Article 1. Meaning of terms, applicability ... ¬ß 2. Objects that offer themselves [ŒµŒØŒΩŒ±Œπ œÄœÅœåœÉœÜŒøœÅŒ±] to attack or defense are also considered weapons.

No license is needed for import, trade or carrying of knives for these uses (Art 7, 5). See also the constitutional court decision 1299/2008 where the intended use of the weapon found in the car of two criminals is the point of discussion. A useful article from a hunting journal (in Greek).article from a hunting journal Hong Kong Under the Weapons Ordinance (Cap 217), certain knives are designated as 'prohibited weapons', including: * Gravity knife * Knuckleduster whether spiked or not and with or without blade * Any bladed or pointed weapon designed to be used in a fashion whereby the handle is held in a clenched fist and the blade or point protrudes between the fingers of the fist * Any knife the blade of which is exposed by a spring or other mechanical or electric device Possession of prohibited weapon is illegal under section 4 of the ordinance and offender is liable to a fine and to imprisonment for 3 years.S.4 Weapons Ordinance Any Police officers or Customs officers can seize and detain any prohibited weapon. Once convicted, the weapon is automatically forfeited to the government and can then be disposed of by the Commissioner of Police.S.13 Weapons Ordinance Hungary Carrying a knife with blade length over is prohibited in public places in Hungary unless justified by sport, work or everyday activity. Automatic Knives, throwing stars and \\"French knives\\" are prohibited regardless of blade length and may be sold only to members of the army, law enforcement and the national security agency. Violation may be punished with a fine up to Ft50,000. Possession at home and transportation in secure wrapping is allowed for everyone. Any non-bladed weapon that is used to \\"increase the strength of a punch\\" is illegal to carry (batons, knuckel dusters, nunchakus etc.). Italy Buying and owning knives is restricted in the case of double edged knives, automatic (open-assisted) knives and weapons such as swords. Carrying knives is permitted only for 'valid reason', e.g. for camping, fishing, etc.; usually not in towns ‚Äì and never for self-defense. Otherwise only 'transport' is permitted, not 'at hand' but deep in your pack, etc. There is considerable leeway in practice: Police and border guards will sometimes confiscate knives if they are 'too long'. Some tourist sites have metal detectors and confiscate knives. Japan \\"Swords\\" means a sword with a blade of or more requires permission from the prefectural public safety commission in order to possess. Permission requirements also apply to any type of sword over 6 cm (including automatic knives), spears over in blade length, and Japanese glaves. All knives with a blade length over are prohibited from being carried, under a crime law, with an exception for carrying for duty or other justifiable reasons. Possession is considered a petty crime and is not usually punishable by prison time. However, in cases where assault occurs with the knife, there is a penalty of up to 2 years prison or up to a ¬•300,000 fine. Folding knives with a blade length less than (such as Swiss Army knives) are permitted, while SAK with a lock blade are prohibited from being carried. Latvia Latvian legislation \\"Law On the Handling of Weapons\\" defines knives as: :(1) Cold weapon ‚Äì an object that has the features of a weapon and that is intended to cause damage utilising human muscle strength or special mechanisms. and prohibits :(2) ..to carry non-firearm weapons except the non- firearm weapons necessary for hunters ‚Äì in hunting and non-firearms necessary to sportsmen for the relevant sport ‚Äì in competitions or training. Lithuania According to Lithuanian law it is legal to possess and carry most types of knives. This includes hunting knives, pocket knives, multi- tools, survivor knives, balisongs etc. as knives are not considered weapons. The only exception are switchblades. It is illegal to carry or possess a switchblade if it meets one of the following criteria: the blade is longer than 8.5 cm; the width in the middle of the blade is less than 14% of its total length; the blade is double sided. Netherlands=National law As of 2011, Dutch Law prohibits ownership or possession of the following knives: * stilettos * switchblades * throwing knives * folding knives with more than one cutting edge * folding knives with an overall length of more than when deployed * butterfly (balisong) * gravity knives * disguised knives (belt knife, sword cane, etc.) and push daggers. Local law In addition to national laws, every Dutch city and urban district has the right to prohibit carrying of any knife that can potentially be used as a weapon in certain \\"safety risk\\" areas. Such a \\"no-go\\" area could include geographically limited urban areas such as bars, caf√©s, concerts, and public gathering places or events. In public, a knife must be transported in such a manner so that it is not directly usable by the owner, such as storing the knife in a locked case for carrying in a backpack, or placing the locked-up knife in a storage area of a vehicle separate from the passenger compartment. Notes Additionally, it is illegal to carry a fixed-blade knife with multiple cutting edges. However such a knife may be kept at home for collector purposes. Norway According to Norwegian law, one can spend up to 6 months in prison for purposefully bringing a knife or similar sharp tool especially suited for causing bodily harm to a public place, or for helping others do so. The law does not cover knives or other tools worn or used for work, outdoor pursuits or similar reputable purposes. Note that this includes bringing knives in one's car. It is also illegal to buy, own or store switchblade knives, butterfly knives and stilettos. Poland All kinds of knives are regarded as dangerous tools, but are not considered weapons under Polish law,Act of 21 May 1999 on weapons and ammunition (Dz.U. 1999 nr 53 poz. 549) so no restriction related to weapons apply. The exception is a blade hidden in an object that doesn't look like a weapon (a sword in an umbrella, a dagger in a shoe etc.). It is legal to sell, buy, trade and possess any knives, and Polish law does not prohibit carrying a knife in a public place. However, certain prohibitions in possession of so-called \\"dangerous tools\\" may apply during mass events.Act of 20 March 2009 on the safety of the mass events (Dz.U. 2009 nr 62 poz. 504) Russia Only certain knives are considered \\"melee weapons\\" and regulated in Russia, the others are common tools and are entirely unregulated, however using them in a violent manner is considered an \\"improvised weapon\\" usage and is an aggravating circumstance when the charges for an aggressive behavior are filed, and the local regulations may prevent bringing of \\"dangerous objects\\" to some events or businesses. The key point of knife regulations in Russia lies in the fact that the determination whether the particular knife represent a weapon or an unregulated tool lies entirely within the opinion of a certified expert or an authorized certification board. In practice this means that there's no legal difference between the knife as a tool and as a weapon, and most given examples may be considered either, the only difference being the certificate issued by an authorized body, and any knife having this certificate being explicitly legal. Certifying the knives as a tool is not difficult and most producers and importers do this, issuing a copy of a certificate with the knife during the sale, for presentation to the police officers in case of an inquiry. However, unauthorized possession, creation, sale and transport of bladed weapons were decriminalized in 2001 and is now only a civil offence, carrying the penalty between 500 and 2000 rubles ($7.5 to $30) and/or a ban on a bladed weapon possession for 6 months to a year. Also, carrying any knife for self-defence (but not for other needs) is prohibited. For the knives considered weapons the law forbids only the throwing knives, and the automatic and gravity knives with the blades longer than (the shorter blades are allowed, providing the owner having the relevant permission). Serbia The \\"Weapons and Munitions law\\" article 2. lists different types of weapons. It states that: \\"melee weapons, brass knuckles, dagger, kama, saber, bayonet and other items whose primary purpose is offense\\" are considered weapons. Most knives are therefore considered tools and technically legal to possess and carry. However, since any knife could be used a melee weapon and the law doesn't differentiate between particular types it is up to the authorities to determine the intent of the individual in possession of the knife and whether there is a \\"good reason\\" to do so. Thus fixed blade knives are considered appropriate for particular professions or when hunting and fishing, but will likely be treated as a weapon in an urban environment. Switchblades, butterfly knives, blades concealed in everyday objects are usually treated as weapons and assisted opening knives may also fall into that category. The appearance of the knife (how aggressive it appears), the length (although there is no legal limit on length), the location where it was carried (large gatherings, schools, public buildings etc.) and the demeanor of the person carrying the knife all factor into the decision on whether the law has been broken. Purchase, possession and carry of a melee weapon is classified as a misdemeanor, subject to a fine of up to 10,000 dinars or up to 60 days imprisonment (\\"Weapons and Munitions law\\", article 35. In practice the less akin to a weapon the knife appears, and if carried and used with \\"good judgment\\" the lesser the likelihood of legal consequences. Slovakia Carrying a knife in Slovakia is not explicitly prohibited nor are there any prohibited types of knives. However Act No. 372/1990 Offences Act states in paragraph 47 that carrying of a \\"cold weapon\\" such as knife, dagger, or sabre on public places is a non-criminal offense to public safety if, from the circumstances of the case or the behaviour of the person, it can be concluded that these weapons can be used for violence or threats of violence. It is up to the individual assessment of any single situation by a policeman whether carrying of such a weapon can lead to violence. This offense can be penalized with maximum ‚Ç¨500. An example of such a situation is visibly carrying of a knife in crowded public places, public meetings, etc. Spain In Spain there are stringent laws proscribing the carrying of armas blancas, or fighting knives, and prohibiting the manufacture, sale, possession or use of certain knives classified as prohibited weapons.Reglamentaci√≥n espa√±ola de armas, retrieved 31 July 2011Prohibited Arms , retrieved 17 December 2011 Armas blancas and other sharp-bladed instruments or cutting tools may be freely purchased and owned provided they are not on the list of prohibited weapons, are not purchased or possessed by minors, are kept at home for the exclusive purpose of a collection, and are not transported on the public roads. It is against the law generally to carry, display or use any kind of knife in public, especially knives with pointed blades, unless one is on one's own property or is working or engaged in a legitimate sporting activity requiring the use of such a knife. The list of prohibited weapons is found in Anexo I ‚Äì Armas prohibidas of the Real Decreto 137/1993 Por El Que Se Aprueba EL Reglamento de Armas, which prohibits the manufacture, importation, distribution, sale, possession and use of sword canes, automatic knives (switchblades), as well as daggers of any type. Knives with a double-edged, pointed-tip blade or less in length (measured from the forward end of the handle to the tip of the blade) are considered to be armas blancas, which may be owned, but not carried in public. The law also prohibits the marketing, advertising, sale, possession, and use of folding knives with a blade length exceeding , measured from the bolster or top of the handle to the tip of the blade. Certain exceptions to the list of prohibited knives exist for legitimate knife collections and historical artifacts registered with the Guardia Civil for possession exclusively at one's own home. Civilians are prohibited from possessing knives, machetes, and other bladed weapons officially issued to the police, military, and other official authorities without a special license. Sale of such weapons requires the presentation of an official arms license duly certifying the identity and status of the person entitled to possess such weapons. Sweden Swedish law prohibits the carrying of knives in public areas, including schools and vehicles at these areas, if the carrier intends to use the knife as a weapon in the commission of a crime. Examples of legitimate purposes include artisans who use a knife at work, soldiers in uniform carrying a knife, or normal use of a pocket knife. The same law also regulates some other objects that are made to thrust, cut, or that are otherwise intended for crime against life and health. Furthermore, objects that are \\"particularly\\" intended for crime against life and health, such as switchblades, shurikens and brass knuckles, are not permitted to be given or sold to anyone under the age of 21.Swedish Police: Knivar och andra farliga f√∂rem√•l Carrying a weapon for self-defence does not count as a legitimate purpose. United Kingdom An anti-knife crime demonstration in Wood Green, north London, October 2019 The 1689 Bill of Rights ensured that only Parliament and not the King could restrict the right of the people to bear arms. Over the last 60 years, Parliament has enacted a series of increasingly restrictive laws and acts regarding the possession and use of knives and bladed tools. Ambulance service data gathered in 2009 suggested a slow increase in knife crime incidents in the UK although the overall rate remained low. Official figures from the Home Office show 43,516 recorded knife offences in the 12 months leading up to March 2019, double what was reported just five years earlier. A 2019 survey of 2,000 parents showed that 72% were worried their child could become a victim of knife crime with one in 13 saying they know of a youngster who has been a victim. England and WalesRestriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959= The Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959 (amended 1961) (ROWA), prohibits the importation, sale, hire, lending, or gift of certain types of knives in England, Wales, and Scotland as of 13 June 1959Restriction of Offensive Weapons Bill , New Statesman, retrieved 30 October 2011Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959: Short title, commencement, and extent, retrieved 30 October 2011 under Section 1: :(1) Any person who manufactures, sells or hires or offers for sale or hire, or exposes or has in his possession for the purpose of sale or hire or lends or gives to any other person‚Äî ::(a) any knife which has a blade which opens automatically by hand pressure applied to a button, spring or other device in or attached to the handle of the knife, sometimes known as a flick knife or \\"flick gun\\"; or ::(b) any knife which has a blade which is released from the handle or sheath thereof by the force of gravity or the application of centrifugal force and which, when released, is locked in place by means of a button, spring, lever, or other device, sometimes known as a gravity knife, :shall be guilty of an offence [...] Subsection 2 also makes it illegal to import knives of this type as of 13 June 1959. The above legislation criminalizes the conduct of the original owner or transferor of an automatic-opening or gravity knife, not the new owner or transferee; in addition, the statute does not criminalize possession of such knives other than possession for the purpose of sale or hire. It is therefore not illegal per se to merely possess such a knife, though the difficulties of acquiring one without violating the statute makes it (almost) impossible to obtain one without either committing or abetting an offence. The above legislation does not apply to assisted-opening knives (a.k.a. semi-auto knives) as there are two elements to this definition that separate them. Firstly, they do not open 'automatically' as they are opened by hand manually and then continue themselves. Secondly, the pressure is applied to a notch in the blade itself, not to a \\"button, spring or other device in or attached to the handle\\". As of April 2018, the Home Office have made proposals to update the Criminal Justice Act 1988 to add assisted-opening knives to the increasing list of prohibited items under this act. =Criminal Justice Act 1988= The Criminal Justice Act 1988 mainly relates to carrying knives in public places, Section 139 being the most important: :(1) Subject to subsections (4) and (5) below, any person who has an article to which this section applies with them in a public place shall be guilty of an offence. :(2) Subject to subsection (3) below, this section applies to any article which has a blade or is sharply pointed except a folding pocketknife. :(3) This section applies to a folding pocketknife if the cutting edge of its blade exceeds . :(4) It shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to prove that he had good reason or lawful authority for having the article with him in a public place. The definition of \\"public place\\" is defined in Section 139(7) Criminal Justice Act 1988 as: \\"In this section \\"public place\\" includes any place to which at the material time the public have or are permitted access, whether on payment or otherwise.\\" This can be loosely defined as anywhere the public have a legitimate right to be whether this access is paid for or not, which could include any populated area within the England and Wales, including one's motor vehicle, which is defined by law as a 'public place' unless parked on private property. A public place could include: 1) an organised wilderness gathering or event; 2) a National Park; 3) Forestry Commission land that is held open to the public; 4) public footpaths; 5) bridleways; and 6) any area where an individual does not need to ask specific permission to walk, camp, or travel from a landowner. Non-public places would be a person's residence, the area behind a counter in a shop, a locked building site, etc. ‚Äì essentially anywhere a person would have to unlawfully commit trespass to gain access to. The phrase \\"good reason or lawful authority\\" in Subsection 4 is intended to allow for \\"common sense\\" possession of knives, so that it is legal to carry a knife if there is a bona fide reason to do so. Subsection 5 gives some specific examples of bona fide reasons: a knife for use at work (e.g. a chef's knife), as part of a national costume (e.g. a sgian dubh for Scottish Highland dress), or for religious reasons (e.g. a Sikh Kirpan). However, even these specific statutory exceptions have proven unavailing to knife owners at times. It is important to note that \\"good reason or lawful authority\\" exceptions may be difficult to establish for those not using a knife in the course of their trade or profession, but merely because the knife is needed in case of emergency or for occasional utility use.Baton Charge Racing Boss Cleared: In 2004, a businessman and ex-military officer, Nicholas Samengo-Turner, was stopped at a mass search checkpoint in London and arrested for possessing a small Swiss Army multitool with two short locking blades ( and ) in the locked boot of his car. While eventually cleared, the arrest cost Samengo-Turner a multi-million pound business deal and thousands of pounds in court costs. Although English law insists that it is the responsibility of the prosecution to provide evidence proving a crime has been committed, an individual must provide evidence to prove that they had a \\"good reason or lawful authority\\" for carrying a knife (if this is the case) upon being detained. While this may appear to be a reversal of the usual burden of proof, technically the prosecution has already proven the case (prima facie) by establishing that a knife was being carried in a public place (see Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 on Knives, etc.; New powers to tackle gun and knife crime) As the burden of proving \\"good reason or lawful authority\\" lies with the defendant, it is likely that an individual detained and searched by the police will need to prove the following (sometimes known as the THIS list): Has THIS person got permission; to use THIS article (knife); for THIS use; on THIS land; and by THIS land owner. The special exception which exists in the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (Sec. 139) for folding knives (pocket knives with non-locking blades) with a cutting edge (not blade) less than long, is another \\"common sense\\" measure accepting that some small knives are carried for general utility; This exemption however only applies to folding knives without a locking mechanism. The wording of the Criminal Justice Act does not mention locking and so the definition of \\"folding pocket knife\\" was settled through case law. In the Crown Court appeal of Harris v. DPP (1992) and the Court of Appeal case of R. v Deegan (1998) the ruling that 'folding' was intended to mean 'non-locking' was upheld. As the only higher court in England and Wales to the Court of Appeal is the Supreme Court, the only way the decision in R. v. Deegan could be overturned is by a dissenting ruling by the Supreme Court or by Act of Parliament.Harris v. DPP, 1 All ER 562, [1993] 1 WLR 82, 96 Cr App Rep 235, 157 JP 205 (1992) =Offensive Weapons Act 1996= The Offensive Weapons Act 1996 covers the possession of knives within school premises: :(1) Any person who has an article to which section 139 of this Act applies with him on school premises shall be guilty of an offence. :(2) Any person who has an offensive weapon within the meaning of section 1 of the M1 Prevention of Crime Act 1953 with him on school premises shall be guilty of an offence. :(3) It shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (1) or (2) above to prove that he had good reason or lawful authority for having the article or weapon with him on the premises in question. :(4) (Subsection 4 gives the same specific exceptions as subsection 139(5) with the addition of \\"for educational purposes\\". This would appear to imply that all legislation on knives in public applies similarly to school premises, and therefore a folding pocket knife with a cutting edge (not blade) under in length would be considered legal. The Offensive Weapons Act 1996 imposes an age restriction on the sale of knives: :(1) Any person who sells to a person under the age of sixteen years an article to which this section applies shall be guilty of an offence [...] :(2) Subject to subsection (3) below, this section applies to‚Äî ::(a) any knife, knife blade or razor blade...The Criminal Justice Act 1988 (Offensive Weapons) (Exemption) Order 1996:Under (2)(b), safety razor blades are exempted from this section, so that only straight razors are affected. The Criminal Justice Act 1988 (Offensive Weapons) (Exemption) Order 1996 states restrictions to sales of knives to those under 16 does not apply to: * folding pocket-knife if the cutting edge of its blade does not exceed * razor blades permanently enclosed in a cartridge or housing where less than of any blade is exposed beyond the plane which intersects the highest point of the surfaces preceding and following such blades. These age restrictions in the Criminal Justice Act 1988 were increased to 18, effective from 1 October 2007, by the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006. Word in s. 141A(1) substituted (E.W.) (1.10.2007) by Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 (c. 38), ss. 43(2), 66(2); S.I. 2007/2180, art. 3(j) In Scotland, the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 makes it an offence to sell knives to someone under 18 years of age (including any blade, razor blade, any bladed or pointed article, or any item made or adapted for causing personal injury). =Knives Act 1997= The Knives Act 1997 prohibits the sale of combat knives and restricts the marketing of knives as offensive weapons. =Prevention of Crime Act 1953= The Prevention of Crime Act 1953 prohibits the possession in any public place of an offensive weapon without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.Bryan v. Mott, 62 Cr App R 71 (1976): 'Lawful authority‚Äô means those occasions where people from time to time are required to carry weapons as a matter of governmental duty, such as police officers or members of the armed forces, not private persons. The term \\"offensive weapon\\" is defined as: \\"any article made or adapted for use to causing injury to the person, or intended by the person having it with him for such use\\". Under the Prevention of Crime Act, otherwise 'exempt' knives carried for \\"good reason or lawful authority\\" may be still deemed illegal if authorities conclude the knife is being carried as an \\"offensive weapon\\". In recent years, the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 has been reinterpreted by police and public prosecutors, who have persuaded the courts to minimize exceptions to prosecution on the grounds that the defendant had \\"lawful authority or reasonable excuse\\" in order to apply the Act to a wide variety of cases. This new approach now includes prosecution of citizens who have admitted carrying a knife for the sole purpose of self-defence (in the eyes of the law, this is presently viewed as an admission that the defendant intends to use the knife as an \\"offensive weapon\\", albeit in a defensive manner, and in otherwise justifiable circumstances).DirectGov, Crime and Violence: Knife crime, DirectGov UK Government Information Service, England & Wales: \\"If you carry a knife to protect yourself or make yourself feel safer but don‚Äôt intend to use it then you are committing a crime.\\" While the onus lies on the officer to prove offensive intent, prosecutors and courts have in the past taken the appearance and the marketing of a particular brand of knife into account when considering whether an otherwise legal knife was being carried as an offensive weapon. In addition, the Knives Act 1997 now prohibits the sale of combat knives and restricts the marketing of knives as offensive weapons. A knife which is marketed as \\"tactical\\", \\"military\\", \\"special ops\\", etc. could therefore carry an extra liability. =Proposals= While at his retirement ceremony in May 2018, Judge Nic Madge suggested at Luton Crown Court that members of the public could obtain or modify kitchen knives with rounded ends to be less dangerous. Judge Madge said if his proposals were implemented there would be a \\"substantial\\" reduction in the number of life-threatening injuries caused by stabbings. A similar proposal was made in 2005 by three emergency medicine health professionals from West Middlesex University Hospital. =Case law= Case law in 2005 stated that even a butter knife can be classed as a bladed article in a public place. Scotland In Scotland, the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 prevents the carrying of offensive weapons as well as pointed or bladed articles in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. Defences exist to a charge of possessing a bladed or pointed article in a public place when carried for use at work, as part of a national costume or for religious reasons. As in England and Wales, an exception is allowed for folding pocket knives which have a blade of less than Other relevant Scotland knife legislation includes the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (Offensive Weapons Act) (Scotland) Order 2005, which bans sword canes, push daggers, butterfly (balisong knives), throwing stars, knives that can defeat metal detectors, and knives disguised as other objects, and the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2006, which makes it an offence to sell a knife, knife blade, or bladed or pointed object to a person under eighteen years of age, unless the person is sixteen or older and the knife or blade is \\"designed for domestic use.\\" In 2007, the Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Act 2007 allowed exemption from criminal liability under section 141 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 for selling a prohibited offensive weapon if the sale was made for purposes of theatrical performances and of rehearsals for such performances, the production of films (as defined in section 5B of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988), or the production of television programmes (as defined in section 405(1) of the Communications Act 2003). Under the Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Act 2007 (in force since 10 September 2007), the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 was amended and it was made compulsory to possess a local authority licence to sell knives, swords and blades (other than those designed for 'domestic use'), or to sell any sharply pointed or bladed object \\"which is made or adapted for use for causing injury to the person.\\" Any dealer in non- domestic knives will be required to hold a ‚Äòknife dealer‚Äôs licence‚Äô. Northern Ireland The laws restricting knife ownership, use, possession and sale are nearly identical to the laws of Scotland and the rest of the UK, though contained in different acts.Knives and the Law , NIdirect Government Services, retrieved 25 July 2011 In 2008, in response to a surge in public concern over knife-related crimes, Northern Ireland doubled the prison sentence for persons convicted of possessing a knife deemed to be an offensive weapon in a public place to four years' imprisonment, and added an evidential presumption in favour of prosecution for possession of a knife. United States=Federal laws Under the Switchblade Knife Act of 1958 (amended 1986, codified at 15 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß1241‚Äì1245), switchblades and ballistic knives are banned from interstate shipment, sale, or importation, or possession within the following: any territory or possession of the United States, i.e. land belonging to the U.S. federal government; Indian lands (as defined in section 1151 of title 18); and areas within the maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the federal government, with the exception of federal, state law enforcement agencies and the military.United States Code, Title 15, Chapter 29, Sections 1241‚Äì1245 In addition, federal laws may prohibit the possession or carrying of any knife on certain federal properties such as courthouses or military installations. U.S. federal laws on switchblades do not apply to the possession or sale of switchblade knives within a state's boundaries; the latter is regulated by the laws of that particular state, if any. Occasional disputes over what constitutes a switchblade knife under federal law has occasionally resulted in U.S. Customs seizures of knives from U.S. importers or manufacturers.Precise Imports v. Kelly, 378 F.2d 1014 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 973, 88 S.Ct. 472, 19 L.Ed.2d 465 (1967)United States v. Murphree, 783 F.2d 605, 609‚Äì10 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 107 S.Ct. 142, 93 L.Ed.2d 84 (1986) In one case the seizure of a shipment of Columbia River Knife & Tool knives resulted in an estimated US$1 million loss to the company before the shipment was released. Amendment 1447 to the Switchblade Knife Act (15 U.S.C. ¬ß1244), signed into law as part of the FY2010 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill on October 28, 2009, provides that the Act shall not apply to spring-assist or assisted-opening knives (i.e. knives with closure-biased springs that require physical force applied to the blade to assist in opening the knife).Amendment 1447 to 15 U.S.C. ¬ß1244 adds a fifth exception to the definition of a switchblade knife: Sections 1242 and 1243 of this title shall not apply to: 5) a knife that contains a spring, detent, or other mechanism designed to create a bias toward closure of the blade and that requires exertion applied to the blade by hand, wrist, or arm to overcome the bias toward closure to assist in opening the knife. State and local laws Each state also has laws that govern the legality of carrying weapons, either concealed or openly, and these laws explicitly or implicitly cover various types of knives. Some states go beyond this, and criminalize mere possession of certain types of knives. Other states prohibit the possession and/or the concealed carrying of knives that feature blade styles or features sufficient to transform them into \\"dangerous weapons\\"Wong, David, Knife Laws of the Fifty States: A Guide for the Law-Abiding Traveler, AuthorHouse, , (2006)Wong, p. 134: Dangerous weapon, i.e. a knife capable of being transformed by circumstances of its threatened, attempted, or actual use into a weapon capable of causing death or \\"deadly weapons\\", i.e. knives either optimized for lethality against humans or designed for and readily capable of causing death or serious bodily injury.Ohin v. Commonwealth of Virginia, 622 S.E. 2d 784, 47 Va App. 194 (Va Ct. App. 2005): (Virginia Court of Appeals affirmed conviction for concealed carry of folding knife with locking blade, crossguard, and oversized handle, based on 'catchall' provision in Virginia Code ¬ß 18.2-308(A)(v) prohibiting concealed carry of 'any weapon of like kind'. These frequently include knives with specific blade styles with a historical connection to violence or assassination, including thrusting knives such as the dirk, poignard, and stiletto, the bowie knife, and double-edged knives with crossguards designed for knife fighting such as the dagger.Cassidy, William L., The Complete Book Of Knife Fighting, , (1997), pp. 9‚Äì18, 27‚Äì36 Some states make the carrying or possession of any dangerous or deadly weapon with intent to unlawfully harm another a crime. Summaries of every state knife law are available from handgun law websites. =Historical origin= The origin of many knife laws, particularly in the southern states, comes from attempts by early state legislatures to curtail the practice of knife fighting and dueling with large knives such as the bowie knife, which was commonly carried as an item of personal defense prior to the invention of the revolver.See Ala. Code 1975, ¬ß13-6-120, Sec. 13A-11-50: \\"Carrying concealed weapons. Except as otherwise provided in this Code, a person who carries concealed about his person a bowie knife or knife or instrument of like kind or description or a pistol or firearm of any other kind or an air gun shall, on conviction, be fined not less than $50.00 nor more than $500.00, and may also be imprisoned in the county jail or sentenced to hard labor for the county for not more than six months.\\" A companion statute allows the jury to mitigate punishment if the accused can produce evidence that he was reasonably in fear of being attacked at the time he was carrying the concealed knife. In Alabama,Ala. Code 1975 Mississippi,Mississippi Code, Crimes ¬ß 97-37-1: Deadly weapons; carrying while concealed; use or attempt to use; penalties: \\"(1) Except as otherwise provided in Section 45-9-101, any person who carries, concealed in whole or in part, any bowie knife, dirk knife, butcher knife, switchblade knife...shall upon conviction be punished\\" by a fine and/or imprisonment. New Mexico,New Mexico, Criminal Offenses ‚Äì 30-1-12 (B), Definitions...\\"deadly weapon\\" means any... weapon which is capable of producing death or great bodily harm, including but not restricted to any types of daggers, ...bowie knives, poniards, butcher knives, dirk knives..\\"New Mexico, Criminal Offenses ‚Äì 30-7-2: \\"Unlawful carrying of a deadly weapon... consists of carrying a concealed...deadly weapon anywhere, except in the following cases: own residence or property; private automobile, or other means of conveyance.\\" and Virginia, the carrying on one's person of large and lengthy fighting knives capable of causing grievous wounds such as the Bowie knifeWalker, Greg, Battle Blades: A Professional's Guide to Combat/Fighting Knives, (1993), p. 210: The effectiveness of the Bowie knife can be seen in one of Col. James (Jim) Bowie's early fights in which he defended himself against three knife and gun-wielding attackers. At the end of the fight, all three of Bowie's assailants were dead; one man was nearly decapitated, the second was disemboweled, and the third had his skull split open. is prohibited by statute,Virginia Code ¬ß 18.2-308(A): The Virginia statute prohibits only the concealed carrying of a Bowie knife upon one's person, while Texas prohibits the carrying of such a knife whether concealed or not. originally in the interest of controlling or eliminating the then-common practice of dueling, a term which had degenerated from a rarely used social custom into a generalized description for any knife or gun fight between two contestants.Virginia Code ¬ß 18.2-308(A) In many jurisdictions, a local tradition of using knives to settle differences or for self-defenseCassidy, p. 10: In some states the popularity of certain knives such as the Bowie and Arkansas Toothpick was such that schools were established to teach their use in knife fighting, further popularizing such knives and compelling authorities to pass legislation severely restricting such schools. resulted in the enactment of statutes that restricted the size and length of the knife and particularly, the length of its blade. After the Civil War, many restrictions on knife and even gun ownership were imposed by state, county, and city laws and ordinances that were clearly based on fear of weapon possession by certain racial groups, particularly African-American and Hispanic Americans.Cramer, Clayton, Concealed Weapon Laws of the Early Republic: Dueling, Southern Violence, and Moral Reform, Greenwood Publishing Group, (1999), p. 118Cramer, Clayton E., The Racist Roots of Gun Control, (1993) In some states, so-called \\"Black Codes\\" adopted after the Civil War required blacks to obtain a license before carrying or possessing firearms or Bowie knives. The governments of Texas and other former states of the Confederacy, many of which had recognized the right to carry arms such as Bowie knives openly before the Civil War,Cockrum v. State, Texas Supreme Court (1859) passed new restrictions on both gun and knife possession and use.Cockrum v. State, id. In some cases, these laws were directed at freed slaves and other minorities; in other cases, by reconstruction legislatures anxious to disarm rebellious militias and groups seeking to disenfranchise African-American and other minorities.Halbrook, Stephen P., The Right to Bear Arms in Texas: The Intent of the Framers of the Bill of Rights, Baylor Law Review, 41 Baylor L. Rev., pp. 629‚Äì688 (1989) The April 12, 1871 law passed by the Texas' Reconstruction legislature is typical, and is the ancestor of the present law restricting knife possession and use in Texas: While most gun restrictions were eventually repealed, many knife laws remained in effect in the South. In Texas, this was largely explained by the presence of large numbers of Tejanos.McDonald, Jason, Racial Dynamics in Early Twentieth-Century Austin, Texas, Lexington Books, (2012), p. 48: The typical Tejano heritage was commonly portrayed as displaying a proclivity for \\"knife play\\" frequently culminating in a fatality. By 1870, Texas whites of the day had almost universally and exclusively adopted the revolver for self-defense, while Tejanos, steeped in the blade culture (el legado Andaluz) of Mexico and Spain and generally without the means to purchase handguns, continued to carry knives. Thus while local and state Texas gun laws and ordinances were gradually relaxed or eliminated during the late 1800s, the old prohibitions against bowie knives, daggers, dirks, and other long-bladed knives remained on the books, since they served to disarm and control a minority group viewed as engaging in lawless behaviors and violence without legal justification. The Texas law remained on the books for almost 150 years, until modified in 2017 to allow carrying these weapons with some restrictions. =Interpreting current state laws= Many of today's state criminal codes restricting knife use and ownership have been amended repeatedly over the years rather than rewritten to remove old classifications and definitions that are largely a historical legacy, a process that frequently results in illogical, confusing, and even conflicting provisions. Thus in Arkansas, a state in which knife fights using large, lengthy blades such as the Bowie and Arkansas toothpick were once commonplace,The Wilson-Anthony Fight , Department of Arkansas-Heritage, retrieved 1 August 2011: In 1836 a knife fight broke out between the Speaker of the Arkansas House of Representatives, John Wilson, and Rep. Joseph Anthony in the middle of a contentious legislative session; Anthony was killed, while Wilson was expelled from office and later indicted for murder. a state statute made it illegal for someone to \\"carry a knife as a weapon\\",Arkansas Criminal Statute Section 5-73-121: Punishable except when \\"upon a journey or upon [one's] own premises\\", this statute was clearly designed to enable prosecution of persons carrying knives without good cause in towns and cities, while exempting farmers and others carrying knives on their own property or when traveling to and from their local communities. specifying that any knife with a blade or longer constituted prima facie evidence that the knife was being carried as a weapon, yet allowed a complete exemption to the law when \\"upon a journey\\".Section 5-73-121, Arkansas Criminal Code (2006) While Arkansas eventually repealed its archaic criminal knife possession law in its entirety,Arkansas Repeals Anti-Knife Statute: Section 5-73-121 of the Arkansas criminal code was repealed in its entirety in 2007. other states still periodically amend archaic criminal codes that penalize both historic and present-day behavior involving knife use and ownership; these patchwork statutes can result in lengthy legal disputes over legislative intent and definitions.End Knife Control, The Washington Times, 22 May 2012Levine, Bernard, Oppressive Knife Laws in America: What They Are, What You Can Do About Them, and the Anti-Knifer Mindset, Blade Magazine (July 1998) As one example, Indiana law makes it illegal to possess a \\"dagger, dirk, poniard, stiletto, switchblade knife, or gravity knife\\" on school property, or to possess any knife on school property \\"capable of being used to inflict cutting, stabbing, or tearing wounds\\" if that knife \\"is intended to be used as a weapon\\", but provides for a criminal penalty only if a person \\"recklessly, knowingly, or intentionally\\" possesses such a knife on school property. The statute thus requires 1) an examination of the knife and the legislative history of the statute; 2) expert testimony on the individual characteristics of historic knife designs to determine whether the knife in question fits within one of the six specified categories of knife; 3) a determination as to whether the blade can cause a \\"cutting, stabbing, or tearing wound\\"; 4) a determination as to what degree of injury constitutes a \\"wound\\", and 5) two separate determinations of the defendant's intent by the fact finder ‚Äì before guilt or innocence may be adjudged.Indiana Criminal Code IC 35-47-5-2.5, Possession of a knife on school property: The statute is silent on the question of whether the slightest cut or puncture constitutes a \\"wound\\" (thus effectively banning all knives of any type) or if a de minimis rule applies, a dilemma that forces the trial court to make further inquiries into the statute's legislative history as well as prior appellate court determinations, if any. Some states prohibit the possession of a folding knife with a quick- opening mechanism such as a gravity knife, butterfly knife, balisong, or switchblade. Other states may impose no restrictions at all, while many allow possession with some restrictions (age, carrying on one's person, carrying concealed, carrying while a convicted felon, prohibited possessor, or while in the commission of a serious offense, etc.) The continual advent of new knife designs, such as assisted-opening knives can complicate issues of legality, particularly when state laws have not been carefully drafted to clearly define the new design and how it is to be classified within existing law. This omission has led in the past to cases in which state courts have substituted their own understanding of knife design to interpret legislative intent when applying statutes criminalizing certain types of knives.State of Florida v. Darynani, So.2d (Fla. 4th DCA 2000): In State of Florida v. Darynani, a Florida appellate court held that a poorly written state criminal knife statute (Sec. 790.225) that had been hurriedly drafted in 1985 to prohibit the ballistic knife must be interpreted to prohibit switchblade knives as well, despite the lack of any specific evidence that the legislative branch intended to prohibit switchblades when drafting the ballistic knife provision. The court's error was finally corrected by the Florida Legislature in 2003 with the passage of HB 1227 (2003) (see HB 1227 (2003). In 2014, attention was brought by many newspapers and media outlets to 1950s era legislation leading to many arrests and convictions for possession of the loosely defined gravity knife. This law was later declared unconstitutionally vague and subsequently repealed. City, county, and local laws City, county, and local jurisdictions (to include sovereign Indian nations located within a state boundary) may enact their own criminal laws or ordinances in addition to the restrictions contained in state laws, which may be more restrictive than state law. Virtually all states and local jurisdictions have laws that restrict or prohibit the possession or carrying of knives in some form or manner in certain defined areas or places such as schools, public buildings, courthouses, police stations, jails, power plant facilities, airports, or public events. Local or city ordinances are sometimes drafted to include specific classes of people not covered by the state criminal codes, such as individuals carrying folding knives with locking blades primarily for use as weapons. For example, a San Antonio, Texas city ordinance makes it unlawful for anyone to knowingly carry within city limits \\"on or about his person\\" any folding knife with a blade less than long with a lock mechanism that locks the blade upon opening. This ordinance is designed to work in tandem with the Texas state statuteTexas Criminal Code Sec. 46.01(6)(A) making illegal the carrying of knives with blades longer than .Ordinance Chapter 21, Sec. 21-17, Part II, Code of Ordinances of San Antonio, Texas The San Antonio ordinance allows police to charge persons carrying most types of lock blade knives without good cause with a criminal misdemeanor violation, allowing police to remove the knife from the possession of the offender, while providing exemptions from the ordinance designed to protect certain classes of people the city assumes to pose no threat to public order.Ordinance Chapter 21, Sec. 21-17, Part II, Code of Ordinances of San Antonio, Texas: Sec. 21-17 contains exemption from prosecution for law enforcement and corrections officers, for members of the armed forces, for persons carrying the knife on their own premises or while traveling, for persons engaged in a lawful sporting activity (hunting, fishing), or for those using the knife in connection with a lawful occupation. This ordinance was negated in 2015 when Texas adopted a statewide law preempting any expansion of state knife law by local government entities. Occasionally, city and county ordinances conflict with state law. In one example, the city of Portland, Oregon initially passed a city ordinance banning all pocket knives, until the measure was overturned by the Oregon Supreme Court as conflicting with state criminal statutes.  Constitutional protection  The constitutional status of knives as being protected arms under the Second Amendment (or state analogues to the Second Amendment) is not settled. The California Court of Appeal ruled in People v. Mitchell (2012) that prohibiting the concealed carrying of a dirk or dagger are constitutional. The Connecticut Supreme Court ruled in State v. DeCiccio (2014) that dirk knives and police batons are protected by the Second Amendment.Volokh, Eugene. \\"Second Amendment protects dirk knives and police batons\\". Washington Post.

It is the developer of the famous Soyuz-FG rocket used for manned space flight, as well as the Soyuz-U used for launching unmanned probes.  Overview  Progress Centre is the developer and manufacturer of the Soyuz FG series of launch vehicles used for human spaceflight launches, and the Soyuz-U series used for robotic spacecraft launches. Commercial marketing of these launch vehicles is handled by the company Starsem. TsSKB-Progress' satellite products include the Foton and Foton-M science satellite series, the Yantar military satellites and the Resurs DK Earth resource satellite. The company's main production facilities are located in the city of Samara. They include a design bureau, a large R-7 factory called Progress and an affiliate design bureau KB Foton. Up to 25,000 people work in the Progress factory; of them, 5,000 work in rocket and satellite systems, and 360 work on the R-7 production line at any given time. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the factory has also diversified into machine tools, vodka and sweets.  History  In 1941, the State Aviation Plant No.1 was moved from Moscow to the city now known as Samara, Russia, near the Volga River. The plant, named Dooks, had been created in 1917, using facilities in Moscow which had previously been used for the manufacture of bicycles, motorcycles, and various other vehicles. Before World War II, the plant had manufactured several aeroplane models at the Moscow location, including the MiG-3. During the war, the plant manufactured Ilyushin Il-2 and Ilyushin Il-10 aircraft. In 1946, it began production of MiG-9 and MiG-15 jet fighters, and in 1954, it started to produce Tupolev Tu-16 bombers. On 2 January 1958, the Soviet government ordered State Aviation Plant No. 1 to begin production of R-7 Semyorka rockets. The Central Specialized Design Bureau (TsSKB) was established on 30 June 1974. Dmitri Kozlov, who had been the chief designer of the R-7 and a Deputy Chief Designer of –û–öB-1, was appointed General Designer of TsSKB on 6 July 1983.

Its legacy lies in giving women an opportunity to be leaders and influence in the public sphere. At the age of 17, while in UNIA, Amy Ashwood wrote romantic letters to Marcus, in which she said: \\"Our joint love for Africa and our concern for the welfare of our race urged us to immediate action.\\"Reddock, Rhoda, \\"The first Mrs Garvey: Pan-Africanism and Feminism in the early 20th century British colonial Caribbean\\" , Feminist African 19, 2014 (58‚Äì77), p. 63.

In 1919, she was made secretary of the Black Star Line and became one of its first directors.Shepherd, Verene, Women in Caribbean History, Kingston: Ian Randle, 1999, p. 181. Marriage to Marcus Garvey She met Marcus Garvey in 1914 and they married on 25 December 1919, but the marriage quickly broke down (there were accusations of infidelity on both sides), ending in divorce in 1922. There followed lawsuits and counter-suits for annulment, divorce, alimony and bigamy. Garvey divorced Ashwood in Missouri in 1922 and quickly married Amy Jacques, Ashwood's former roommate and maid of honour. Marcus Garvey accused Ashwood of infidelity, theft, alcoholism and laziness. Amy Ashwood reportedly never accepted the divorce and contended to the end of her days that she was the \\"real\\" Mrs Garvey.\\"Political Biography on Amy Ashwood Garvey: Pan-Africanist, Feminist\\", Pan African News, 21 May 2007.

Move to London Ashwood arrived in London 1932 and continued her endeavors as a Pan- African heroine. Decades earlier, in 1914, Ashwood assisted her husband Marcus Garvey with founding the Negro World, its purpose being to connect African- American people across continents, and founded a popular local night club. She moved to Great Britain, where she struck up a friendship with Ladipo Solanke. Together, they founded the Nigerian Progress Union (NPU), which at its formation consisted of 13 students. At the very first meeting, she was honoured with the Yoruba chieftaincy title \\"Iyalode\\" (meaning \\"Mother of the Community\\").Reddock (2014), \\"The first Mrs Garvey\\", Feminist Africa 19, p. 67. She later supported Solanke's West African Students' Union, but in 1924 she returned to New York, where she produced comedies with her companion, Sam Manning, a Trinidadian calypso singer who was one of the world's pioneering black recording artists. Among the productions was Brown Sugar, a jazz musical production at the Lafayette Theater, which featured Manning and Fats Waller and his band.Chadbourne, Eugene, [ Artist Biography] at Allmusic.com  Return to Jamaica 1940‚Äì44  During World War II Ashwood founded a domestic science institute for girls in Jamaica. She became active in politics upon her return to Jamaica. She became eligible for a candidacy for legislature and was actively engaged in the movement for self-government. She planned to use her position in legislature to push for women's rights.Reddock (2014), \\"The first Mrs Garvey\\", Feminist Africa 19, p. 68‚Äì69. 1934‚Äì44: London and New York In 1934, she returned to London, and with Manning, opened the Florence Mills Social Club a jazz club on Carnaby Street, which became a gathering spot for supporters of Pan-Africanism. Although early pan-Africanists used to have patriarchal characteristics, they awakened women's consciousness for social justice.Reddock (2014), \\"The first Mrs Garvey\\" , Feminist African 19, p. 72. She helped to establish the International African Friends of Abyssinia with C. L. R. James, the International African Service Bureau with figures like George Padmore, Chris Braithwaite and Jomo Kenyatta, and the London Afro-Women's Centre. She spent some time in 1939 in New York, then went to Jamaica, where she and other prominent people formed the short-lived J. A. G. Smith Political Party. In 1944, she again returned to New York, where she joined the West Indies National Council and the Council on African Affairs, and also campaigned for Adam Clayton Powell Jr. 5th Pan-African Congress, 1945, and later years Ashwood was involved in organizing the first session of the 5th Pan-African Congress in Manchester in 1945. During the opening session, she chaired for freedom from British colonial rule. Ashwood and Alma La Badie were the only two women presenters. Eventually on 19 October, the two women were able to speak of issues that Jamaican women were dealt.Reddock (2014), \\"The first Mrs Garvey\\", Feminist Africa 19, p. 69. In 1946, Ashwood moved to Liberia for three years, where she began a relationship with the country's president, William Tubman. While there she researched the conditions for women in Nigeria and she gave talks to women's groups. She then returned to London, helping to set up the \\"Afro Peoples Centre\\" in Ladbroke Grove in 1953. She was a friend of Claudia Jones, and was on the editorial board of the Brixton-based newspaper West Indian Gazette, founded by Jones in 1958.Boyce Davies, Carole, Left of Karl Marx: The Political Life of Black Communist Claudia Jones, Duke University Press, 2008, p. 229.

In 1959, she chaired an enquiry into race relations following the murder of Kelso Cochrane in London in May that year. Travels in Dwaben, Ashanti, Ghana, 1946, and other African countries According to Mrs Garvey, her grandmother told her that she descended from Dwaben (pronounced \\"Juaben\\") and that her grandmother (known as \\"Granny Dabas\\") was a captive from Juaben. Granny Dabas's name was Boahemaa. In 1924 she met J. B. Danquah in London and told him her grandmother's story and Danquah confirmed to her that Dwaben is in fact an Asante city-state. Fifteen years later she also met another Ghanaian Barrister Kwabena Kese. In 1946, Barrister Kese took Mrs Garvey to Juaben leading to the verification of her Granny Dabas' account and would later adopt the name Akosua Boahemaa. She would also meet Osei Tutu Agyeman Prempeh II.\\"From Jamaica To Juaben(Dwaben), Nsuta In Pictures\\", Akrase's, 22 June 2009. The Asante people are commonly known to Jamaicans as the freedom fighters that fought against slavery and oppression. The national heroine Nanny of the Maroons is also an Asante queen. Many Jamaicans, even non- maroons, can also make accounts of having family of Asante descent. Ashwood then embarked on a Caribbean tour in 1953. She visited Antigua, Aruba, Barbados, British Guiana, Dominica, Trinidad and Tobago and Suriname.Reddock (2014), \\"The first Mrs Garvey\\" , Feminist African 19, p. 70. In Barbados, she presided over the formation of the Barbados Women's Alliance. During her tour, Garvey provided multiple lectures throughout the Caribbean. In 1954 Garvey opened The Afro Woman's Centre and Residential Club, in Ladbroke Grove, London.Reddock (2014), \\"The first Mrs Garvey\\" , Feminist African 19, p. 71. She returned to Liberia in 1960, but was back in London four years later, and spent the next three years mostly in Jamaica and Trinidad. In 1967‚Äì68 she toured the United States. With failing health, she returned to Jamaica in 1968, and died in Kingston on 3 May the following year, aged 72.Tony Martin, \\"Garvey, Amy Ashwood (1895/1897‚Äì1969)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006.

History WDVH signed on the air on in October 1955 from its current transmitter location on SE 27th Street (formerly known as Kincaid Road). The call letters stand for the three partners that launched the station, Toby Dowdy, Rob Vaughn and Tom Hanson. Toby Dowdy was a country radio musician, Rob Vaughn owned the land and Tom Hanson was a radio station manager. Initially it was a daytime-only station. In the mid-1950s it became a rock and roller and added a second tower to give it night time service to much of Gainesville. Around 1968 both towers were lost in a storm and only one tower was replaced, making it a non-directional daytime station again. WDVH was sold in 1969 to Roy Danner (of Shoney's restaurant fame) and Larry Edwards. On May 1, 1970 the format changed to country music. On June 30, 1980, the studio building burned down due to an electrical fire. Temporary studios were installed next to the transmitting tower in a double wide trailer while a new permanent studio building was built in place of the old one. In April 1988, WWLO 1430 kHz (now WTMN) was diplexed onto the WDVH tower. WWLO first went on the air with 2.5 kW daytime only. That station increased its power to 10 kW daytime, 45 watts nighttime in July 2003. It was sold again to Bill Morris, who in turn sold it to Crystal which became Pinnacle AM Broadcasting, Inc. The format changed to Adult Standards and the call letters were changed to WLUS in 1996 (US98). In 2000, the transmitter and computer automation equipment was seized by the Alachua County Sheriff's department for failure to pay unrelated business debts. This equipment was bought at auction by morning show host, Jim Brand with the hopes that it could be re-installed, quickly returning the station to the air. When station ownership declined, the transmitter was sold to a religious broadcaster in St. Louis, Mo. The station remained dark for nearly 8 months while a sale was arranged to Pamal Broadcasting. This sale was consummated in late 2000 after Pinnacle installed a new transmitter. When Pamal Broadcasting took over, it combined the studios of WKZY and WHHZ in the WDVH studio building. The format remained Adult Standards until 2004, when it was changed back to Country music under the slogan \\"WDVH Country legends, 101.7 FM 980 AM\\". In 2005 the studios were moved across town to the Sunshine Broadcasting building on 100 NW 76th Drive (Tower Hill office park) along with WTMN, WTMG, WKZY, WHHZ and WDVH-FM. The Country Legends format continues to be very popular along with other local programming such as the Saturday morning show, Swap Shop. WDVH became \\"Florida's Fox News Radio 980 & 720\\" changing format in late October 2011. On May 1, 2016 WDVH changed their format to a simulcast of classic country- formatted WDVH-FM 101.7. On September 6, 2016 WDVH rebranded as \\"I am Country 94.1 & 101.7\\".WDVH Adds Translator as Hank Branding Exits Radioinsight - September 7, 2016 On August 14, 2017, WDVH rebranded as \\"I am Country 106.9\\", after the format and \\"I am Country\\" branding relocated on FM to WPLL. (WDVH-FM was sold at that time to the Radio Training Network, becoming a simulcast of Bradenton station WJIS.)

Development Anxious to retain its position as chief supplier of observation aircraft to the USAAC, Douglas developed a proposal for a high- wing monoplane successor to the O-2. A contract was signed on January 7, 1930 for two XO-31 prototype aircraft, the first of them being flown in December of the same year. A fabric-covered gull-wing monoplane, the XO-31 had a slim corrugated dural-wrapped fuselage, similar to the Thomas-Morse O-19,\\"United States Military Aircraft Since 1909\\" by F. G.

The second aircraft was completed as the YO-31, with a geared Curtiss V-1570-7 Conqueror engine and an enlarged fin, 3\\" longer cowling, and a two-blade, dextrorotatory propeller. Four YO-31A aircraft delivered during early 1932 were modified radically with an elliptical wing planform, a new tail assembly, a smooth semimonocoque fuselage, three-blade propeller, and a canopy over the cockpits. The aircraft appeared with a variety of tail units, the final version (five built) designated O-31A featured a very pointed fin with an inset rudder. The single YO-31B was an unarmed staff transport and the sole YO-31C converted from YO-31A had cantilever main landing gear, and a ventral bulge in the fuselage, which enabled the observer to operate his single 0.3-in (7.62 mm) machine-gun more effectively from a standing position. Five Y1O-31C service-test aircraft were ordered in 1931, and delivered to the USAAC in early 1933 designated Y1O-43. They differed from the final configuration of the O-31A, with a wire- braced parasol wing, and a new fin and rudder. Variants Data from: \\"U.S. Army Aircraft 1908-1946\\" by James C.

C-41 WTRS-FM was Dunnellon's first radio station and one of the earliest successful FM Top 40 stations. The station was sold in 1975 after one of its owners died in an automobile accident, and the format was changed to \\"Contemporary Easy Listening,\\" a hybrid of beautiful music and adult contemporary. WTRS-FM was converted to a country format in 1978, and became one of West-Central Florida's most popular stations.

WTRS had been a country station continuously until 2016. In 1983 the station was sold to its then-owner, Asterisk Communications, who upgraded the WTRS signal from 3,000 to 50,000 watts and in 1988 moved the station to new studios in Ocala. WTRS is unusual among country stations in that it takes an implicitly male-oriented approach, particularly during the drive times.

According to the American social psychologist Leon Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance, disconfirmed expectancies create a state of psychological discomfort because the outcome contradicts expectancy. Upon recognizing the falsification of an expected event an individual will experience the competing cognitions, \\"I believe [X],\\" and, \\"I observed [Y].\\" The individual must either discard the now disconfirmed belief or justify why it has not actually been disconfirmed. As such, disconfirmed expectancy and the factors surrounding the individual's consequent actions have been studied in various settings. Initial study Disconfirmed expectancy was famously illustrated in the 1956 book When Prophecy Fails by Leon Festinger, Henry W. Riecken, and Stanley Schachter. The book gave an inside account of a doomsday cult led by Dorothy Martin (given the alias \\"Marion Keech\\" to preserve her privacy), of Chicago. Martin claimed to have received messages from aliens forecasting a flood that would end the world on December 21, 1954. Festinger and his researchers took the chance to pretend to be a part of the cult in order to observe its behaviors and reaction when the flood failed to occur. Furthermore, Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance, which would be published the following year, predicted that the failure of the prophecy would not break the cult. Instead the group members would look for ways to justify their actions and maintain confidence in the cult. Some members abandoned the group when the prophecy failed to be fulfilled, but most stayed. Those who stayed did not have weakened resolve. There was in fact an increase in their proselytization and their fervor for the new religion. The prediction of the Earth's destruction became a disconfirmed expectancy which resulted in the dissonant cognitions \\"the world is going to end\\" and \\"the world did not end\\". Those who left the cult accepted that they were wrong and discarded their false cognition. Those who stayed instead looked for ways to explain the event in a way that would maintain their beliefs. Eventually they came to the agreement that the planet was spared because of their prayers and actions. Festinger et al. theorized that five conditions must be present for this to occur; that is, there are five conditions that must be met such that a disconfirmation can lead to increased strength of belief: strong belief, commitment to the belief, the possibility that the belief is false, recognition of the disconfirmation, and strong social support (these are detailed below). Conditions for attitude change In When Prophecy Fails the authors describe five conditions under which disconfirmation of a belief may lead to increased fervor in a believer: # A belief must be held with conviction #: The believer must behave in a manner consistent with this belief # The believer must be committed to the belief #: This is apparent when the person holding the belief commits to some action(s) that is difficult to undo, such as selling all of one's possessions or participating in an illegal lifestyle, as with the traditionally polygamist Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints # The belief must be falsifiable #: That is, the belief must be specific enough that a real-world event could disconfirm it # Contradictory evidence must be presented to and recognized by the believer #:The belief must be unequivocally disconfirmed to the believer # The individual believer must have social support The fifth condition is especially important as it states the specific circumstance under which the belief can continue after disconfirmation. Points one and two are necessary conditions that are likely to influence the believer to be resistant to changing the belief. Points three and four are the factors that indicate the belief is flawed and should be absolutely discarded. Thus, the believer is subject to a large amount of cognitive dissonance: \\"I believe something that is not true.\\" In the absence of adequate social support, it is likely that the belief will be discarded to alleviate this pressure. Subsequent study of failed prophecy Following Festinger et al., many others have studied cults based around an unlikely prophecy. As of 1999, twelve other groups had been studied under similar circumstances. Research on these other groups formed around prophetic revelations suggests that their survival following disconfirmation is a more complex matter than When Prophecy Fails describes it. There are at least five different patterns of adaptive proselytization which have been observed: #Survive and begin proselytization #Survive and continue proselytization #Survive and decline in proselytization #Survive but do not proselytize #Neither survive nor proselytize While one of the patterns here involves the dissolution of the group (\\"neither survive nor proselytize\\") this is in the extreme minority as 11 of the 12 groups referenced above continued after disconfirmation of their respective prophecies. In addition to proselytization there are other adaptive strategies including reaffirmation and rationalization which are influenced not only by in-group social support, but also decisive leadership, sophistication of ideology, vagueness of the prophecy, ritual framing, and organization. Rationalization can often go to lengths to justify the false belief. One of the more popular forms of rationalization is \\"spiritualization\\" where the event is said to have happened in the spiritual level and not the physical. Attributional processing Though much research has been done showing the role that disconfirmed expectancy plays in the attitudes and behavior of cultists, it likely plays a larger more general role in attributional processing and has been shown to instigate causal analysis. In theory, when events conform to expectation there is little chance that people will analyze the causes of those events. For an expected event, there is no need to update the pre-existing causal theory that was driving the expectancy. On this logic an unexpected event would likely instigate causal analysis as the existing theory has been proven false or incomplete. In 1973 Newtson showed two groups of people an acted sequence and instructed them to break the sequence into parts. Those who watched an actor perform in an unexpected manner were more likely to break the sequence into smaller meaningful units than those watching an actor perform in an expected manner. Newtson concluded that participants in this study were attending more closely and forming more detailed causal analyses when the actor's behavior deviated from expectation. A later study by Pyszcynski and Greenberg took a more direct approach by creating an expectancy in participants, either fulfilling or deviating from that expectancy, and then presenting the participants with various information to choose from. They found that people were more likely to look for information that would be \\"useful for inferring a cause\\" following disconfirmation and less likely to do so following a confirmation of their expectancy. Though people are more likely to engage in causal processing when there is a discrepancy between belief and outcome, there is a strong bias towards expectancy confirmation. Similarly, disconfirming behavior can be discredited in many ways, including but not limited to selective attention to confirmatory evidence and biased labeling. Uses as a methodology As noted above, disconfirmed expectancy is often paired with cognitive dissonance because the disconfirmation results in two competing cognitions within the individual. As such, disconfirmed expectancy is often used as a reliable method for inducing cognitive dissonance in experimental designs. Generally this is done by introducing an outcome which is dissonant with the participant's established self-concept. The self-concept is often induced as well by creating a strong expectancy toward a certain outcome. For example, in Carlsmith and Aronson (1963) participants were led to believe that a set of signals would reliably precede certain outcomes. To create the disconfirmation, after a few trials the experimenters paired a new outcome with a previous stimulus. When this is not possible, participants are sorted into groups or placed onto a graded scale according to their prior beliefs. Experimenters can do this as Festinger and his researchers did, i.e. join a cult and observe the impending disconfirmation, though this can also be achieved by pre-testing participants and grouping them based on their responses. These methods‚Äîcovert/participant observation, pre-selection‚Äîare not ideal because they pose the problem of selection bias due to non-random assignment. Selected studies The following studies have been selected to show a variety of effects found using experimental paradigms which utilize disconfirmed expectancy. This is by no means an exhaustive or comprehensive list. See Further reading below for more comprehensive reviews on the material. =Hedonic consequences= Disconfirmed expectancies can influence basic hedonic judgment. According to Festinger, cognitive dissonance produces \\"psychological discomfort\\". As Carlsmith and Aronson (1963) extrapolated, it follows that this discomfort puts the individual in a negative hedonic state. Furthermore, they theorized that a negative hedonic state should bias individuals to judge environmental objects in a more negative manner. In the specific study, participants were asked to taste various solutions and rate them on bitterness and sweetness. Participants were additionally instructed to predict whether a bitter solution or a sweet solution would be tasted next, and they were given multiple trials where predictions were rigged to be correct. When participants were incorrect in their guess and had also been correct on the two preceding trials it was labeled a disconfirmed expectancy, as they had developed an expectancy over the two correct trials which was then denied. Following the disconfirmed expectancies participants reliably rated solutions as less pleasant: sweet solutions were rated less sweet and bitter solutions were rated more bitter. =Consumer dissatisfaction= Dissonance theory predicts consumers experience cognitive dissonance when product expectation deviates from product performance. To reduce this disparity and alleviate psychological discomfort the consumer is likely to bring expectations in line with product performance. This statement has been contested and some evidence against is given in a classic paper showing that attitudes tend to further polarize when the conflicting information falls outside of the individual's latitude of acceptance. That is, if the performance is too poor the product will simply be rejected and the consumer will like it even less. Anderson (1973) suggests an assimilation-contrast model that combines the two models. He notes that \\"there is a point beyond which consumers will not accept increasing disparity between product claims and actual [negative] performance\\". At this point, which Muzafer Sherif would label the edge of one's latitude of acceptance, reasonable consideration is no longer given towards product performance and the individual is further polarized towards rejection. Anderson further notes that these results pertain to simply explained products and may not generalize to more complex items. =Vacationing= Pizam and Milman (1993) show that expectancy disconfirmations are good predictor of satisfaction among first-time visitors to a destination. In this study disconfirmations were regressed on a rating of fulfillment of expectations. The larger the discrepancy between expectation and outcome the more that factor influenced the fulfillment rating. Not all disconfirmations are good predictors of the fulfillment rating. The types of disconfirmations that prove to be good predictors are dependent on the goals of the traveler. For instance a disconfirmation related to the \\"quality of deluxe hotels\\" is more influential for travelers categorized as \\"sun-seekers\\" than for those categorized as \\"culture seekers\\". This suggests that individual factors are weighted for their relative importance to one's own satisfaction. =Evaluations of communicators= Expectancy plays a big role in the judgment of communicators and their behavior. When people have expectancies regarding a communicator they evaluate the communicator' attributes and behavior much differently. Prior expectations are likely to continue to be held even after interaction with the communicator, and these expectations will influence later judgments. There seems to be a general expectancy towards pleasant communication and when this is violated evaluations of the target speaker are more negative, even on evaluations of personal attributes. This can work in the opposite direction as well, and a positive deviation from a negative expectancy has a stronger effect on evaluations than confirmations do. That is, merely interacting with another person can leave a less favorable impression of that person than if a prior negative expectancy was held and then disconfirmed through interaction.

At that time, it was the deadliest suicide bombing in Israeli history, and the first successful attack in Tel Aviv.Katz, 153 Twenty-two civilians were killed and 50 were injured.Death toll The attack was planned by Hamas chief Yahya Ayyash, on the eve of the signing of the Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace. Background Yahya Ayyash was disappointed that the previous attack he orchestrated, the Hadera central station suicide bombing, had killed six Israelis. The bomb used in that attack had been small and made of acetone peroxide, a relatively weak explosive. For the attack on bus five, Ayyash constructed a bomb using an Egyptian land mine packed with twenty kilograms of military-strength TNT, surrounded by nails and screws.Katz, 147 TNT is not readily available in the Palestinian territories, but Hamas had managed to acquire some by smuggling it in or purchasing it from Israeli organized crime. The device \\"was one of the best ever built by Ayyash.\\"Katz, 150 Qalqilya resident Saleh Abdel Rahim al- Souwi was selected for the attack. Al-Souwi joined Hamas after his older brother Hasin was killed in 1989, in a shootout with Israeli forces. Al-Souwi was wanted by the Israeli Shabak, but was not considered a high priority.Katz 147-148 The day before the attack, al-Souwi taped a statement saying \\"It is good to die as a martyr for Allah\\" and \\"Sages end up in paradise\\".Katz, 149 Attack Muatab Mukadi, a member of Ayyash's Samaria battalion (of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades), drove al-Souwi to one of the bus's first stops. al-Souwi chose an aisle seat on the left side of the bus, and placed the bomb (stored in a brown bag) at his feet. At approximately 9:00 AM, as the bus was slowing down for a stop 100 metres north of Dizengoff Square, al-Souwi detonated the bomb killing 21 Israelis and one Dutch national. The powerful explosion lifted the bus off its chassis and the heat melted the fiberglass bus frame. Limbs were projected like missiles into the seating area of nearby restaurants.Katz, 151 Following the explosion, a crowd of demonstrators descended on the bomb site chanting \\"Death to the Arabs\\". \\"Police arrested scores of Arab suspects in and around the blast area, though most of them were detained to save them from the crowd's anger.\\" Fatalities *Haviv Tishbi, 54, Tel Aviv *Moshe Gardinger, 83, Tel Aviv *Pnina Rapaport, 74, Tel Aviv *Galit Rosen, 23, Holon *Zippora Ariel, 64, Tel Aviv *David Lida, 74, Tel Aviv *Puah Yedgar, 56, Givatayim *Dalia Ashkenazi, 62, Tel Aviv *Esther Sharon, 21, Lod *Ofra Ben-Naim, 33, Lod *Tamar Carlebach-Sapir, 24, Moshav Zafaria *Shira Meroz-Kot, 20, Kibbutz Beit Hashita *Miriam Adaf, 54, Sderot *Anat Rosen, 21, Ra'anana *Salah Ovadia, 52, Holon *Eliahu Wasserman, 66, Bat Yam *Alexandra Sapirstein, 55, Holon *Pierre Atlas, 56, Kiryat Ono *Ella Volkov, 21, Safed *Ayelet Langer-Alkobi, 26, Kibbutz Yiron *Kochava Biton, 59, Tel Aviv *Reinier Verbiest, 25, Netherlands.Terrorism victims Aftermath Memorial to victims of the attack At the time of the attack, it was the deadliest in Israeli history.

Set in the south of France and Paris in the early 1990s, The Statement is the tale of Pierre Brossard, a former officer in the pro-Fascist militia which served Vichy France, and a murderer of Jews. It was published by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom in 1995 and by E.P. Dutton in the United States on 1 June 1996. Plot summary Now 70 years old, Brossard has spent the better part of his life in hiding, traveling among the monasteries and abbeys that offer him asylum. Though he has evaded capture for decades with the help of the French government and the Catholic Church, now a new breed of government officials is determined to break decades of silence and expose and expiate the crimes of Vichy. Inspiration The character of Pierre Brossard in The Statement is inspired by Paul Touvier (1915‚Äì1996), a French Nazi collaborator who was arrested for war crimes in 1989. After his arrest, charges appeared in the media alleging that Touvier had been protected by the Roman Catholic Church and government officials. In 1994, Touvier became the first Frenchman ever convicted of crimes against humanity, for his participation in the Holocaust under Vichy France. Critical response Emma Hagestadt, writing in The Independent, said that \\"the late Brian Moore's 18th novel is also one of his best ‚Äì a gripping moral thriller based on the real life story of Paul Touvier, 'the torturer of Lyon'\\" and described it as \\"Tautly written and steeped in atmosphere\\".

Origins The society's early members included clergyman and poet John Newton (1725 - 1807), Rector of Clapham and founder of Church Missionary Society John Venn (1759 - 1813), Thomas Scott the Commentator, Richard Cecil, and Henry Foster. The Eclectic Society met fortnightly, initially at the Castle and Falcon Inn, and later in the vestry of St John's Chapel, Bedford Road, London. At the outset in 1783, two of the founding clerics were relatively new in their Metropolitan incumbencies; Newton was four years established at St Mary Woolnorth (having moved from Olney), while Foster had held Long Acre for three years (having served as a lecturer in London since 1766). Cecil held parishes in Sussex, but resided in Islington. The society grew in influence as its membership both expanded and matured. Foreign Missions Foreign missions were first discussed in 1786, and again in 1789 and 1791 with the growing realization of the scope for a society that would evangelise indigenous peoples around the world. Foreign missions was again discussed in 1796, by which time both the Baptist and London Missionary Societies had been founded, but it was not until three years later that action was taken. In 1797, Josiah Pratt, a clergyman from Birmingham who came to London as a curate, joined the Eclectic Society and in February 1799 he proposed the following question for discussion: \\"How far may a periodical Publication be made subservient to the interest of Religion?\\" The discussions led, two years later, to the starting of the Christian Observer which became for much of the nineteenth century a valuable organ of Evangelical principles and work. The following month, the subject for discussion was \\"What methods can we use more effectually to promote the knowledge of the Gospel among the Heathen?\\" and it was ultimately resolved at this meeting to form a society. At a public meeting in April, the Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East was formed. References *Eugene Stock, History of the Church Missionary Society Vol 1 (London 1899) *John H.

The Eclectic Society of Phi Nu Theta (Œ¶ŒùŒò) was originally a college fraternity at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, and was one of the oldest fraternal college organizations in the United States. The society was formally founded by Herman Merrills Johnson, Jonathan Coe, Joshua Newhall, Clark Titus Hinman, and Chester Dormund Hubbard, who met on September 13, 1838, and elected and initiated themselves on that date. (Chandler Robbins was also elected that night but was initiated a week later.) The early Wesleyan societies adopted English names, and not Greek ones; but Eclectic quickly adopted a motto, the Greek initials of which are Phi Nu Theta, and the society operated under both names. The society has always claimed an 1837 foundation for itself, for reasons understood to the members, although no advocate of the society has contravened the fact that the founding meeting was in late 1838. Eclectic was Wesleyan's second fraternity, after the Mystical 7. In the 1850s a Beta chapter existed for ten years at Ohio Wesleyan University and a Gamma chapter enjoyed a month's existence at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania, but both succumbed to the perturbations accompanying the Civil War or to anti-fraternity sentiment among faculty members. There were long discussions about a chapter at Genesee College which never were fruitful. Thereafter, the only chapter was the Alpha chapter at Wesleyan University in Connecticut.  Eclectic Society of Phi Nu Theta to 1970  The Eclectic Society, Phi Nu Theta, was founded in 1838, as is clear from the first meeting date of the society. However, Eclectic has always claimed an 1837 founding date, making it presumptively as old as its older competitor, the Mystical 7 society. (The Mystical 7 is known to have been in existence on July 17, 1837 when an acknowledgement on that date was received from the president of the university.)The Mystical Seven: Wesleyan University 1837 - 1937; Carl F. Price; privately printed; Middletown, Conn. 1937. None of the original Wesleyan societies, the Mystical 7, Eclectic, Tub Philosophers, or Thecanians, had a Greek-letter name. As other Greek-letter societies came to Wesleyan, Eclectic did quickly adopt a Greek motto, and has since been equally known as Phi Nu Theta as Eclectic (with one or the other dominating different eras). The original society may not have survived the stresses of the Civil War without the tireless dedication of William North Rice, '65, who later went on to become a Professor at the University for 51 years and also from time to time as acting President of the University. He was universally regarded as the guiding spirit of the society through the 1920s. From about 1856 to 1865 the Eclectic Society was partners in the Alpha Eating Club with the Mystical 7.Alumni Record of Wesleyan University, Annals, Frank W. Nicholson, ed., 1883 edition, pg. xcviii After 1865, Eclectics controlled the club exclusively, and the Alpha Eating Club survived until 1975. The alumni organization of Eclectic was incorporated by the Connecticut legislature as the Socratic Literary Society in 1870. The first permanent house for the society was the construction of a house in 1882 on a site behind the Allbriton Center where Cross Street currently runs; this had no residential accommodations for undergraduates, and was used for meetings, dining facilities, and society offices. The society in 1906 hired Henry Bacon, formerly of the architectural firm McKim, Mead and White to design a Doric Greek revival structure at 200 High Street. The house is an exemplary design for group living. Many people see the Eclectic house as a design precursor to Bacon's later Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. (They are both designed in a strong Doric style, but lack the typical pediment.) The Alpha Eating Club was housed in the lower stories of the southern wing of the house. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. In 1912, at the seventy-fifth reunion of the society, Stephen Henry Olin reported in an address to the society that after a detailed analysis of the academic standing of each college fraternity chapter at every major university in America back to the 1820s, Phi Nu Theta then had the highest academic ranking of any chapter of any fraternity in the country. Noted alumni of the old Phi Nu Theta Eclectic include Chester D. Hubbard, a founder of Eclectic, and his son, member William P. Hubbard, both prominent at the founding convention of the State of West Virginia, Frederick W. Pitkin '58, two-term Governor of Colorado from 1879, the Congressman and banker Frederick M. Davenport, Walter B. Wriston, who presided over the development of modern consumer banking and the ATM while serving as president and CEO of Citibank, now known as Citicorp, and poet Charles Olson. The list of Society alumni also includes several Wesleyan University Presidents, including Joseph Cummings '40, (former President of Genesee College, later President of Northwestern University), Cyrus David Foss '54, John W. Beach '45, William North Rice '65 (Acting), Stephen Henry Olin '66 (Acting), John Monroe Van Vleck '50 (Acting), and Edwin Deacon Etherington, '48. Many buildings on Wesleyan University's campus are named after prominent Eclectic members, such as Crowell Concert Hall, Olin Memorial Library (Stephen Henry Olin, '65 and his father), Hall and Atwater Labs, the Zilkha Gallery (Ezra Khedouri Zilka, '46 and his wife), and the Van Vleck Observatory, (Astronomy Professor John Monroe Van Vleck). A history of the society has recently been published by the Wesleyan University Press, called A History of The Eclectic Society of Phi Nu Theta, 1837‚Äì1970. The author, William B.B. Moody, is a member and an alumnus of the class of 1959.  One society or two?  In 1970, the undergraduates broke ranks with their alumni, the primary issue at the time being one of recreational drug use. There is a serious and ongoing question as to whether the current organization is a continuation of the old or not. See 1991 Argus letters After a wrenching crisis at the annual meeting of alumni in 1970, the alumni severed ties with the undergraduate institution and dissolved the Socratic Literary Society alumni organization, at the same time, the undergraduates abandoned the initiation ceremony and the constitution, women were elected to membership, the name \\"Phi Nu Theta\\" was abandoned as sounding too much like a Greek-letter fraternity. At the same time, the alumni closed the Alpha Dining Club, the permanent staff (housekeeper and chef) were let go, and the house was sold to the university. For some, the new organization was entirely different, and any connection to the older organization was utterly severed; for others, the new organization continues the principles and community position of the old. In recent years, the students living in Eclectic have attempted to rebuild connections to the older alumni with events during Homecoming and Family Weekend and Commencement & Reunion Weekend. Because of the prestige of the older organization, the prominent position played by the current organization in student life, and other factors, the Wesleyan University administration has never fully pushed the issue of whether the old Eclectic and the new Eclectic were two organizations or one, and for 40 years the house has continued on in this state of ambiguity.  Eclectic Society since 1970  The current society has operated without a constitution for extended periods, and has adopted a Quaker-style consensus decision-making system. The consensus system was formalized under a set of by-laws authored by member Paul Menair in the mid-1980s. Alumni of the newer Eclectic include Le1f, Chris Wink, co-founder of Blue Man Group; Amanda Palmer, songwriter and singer of The Dresden Dolls; Ben Goldwasser, Will Berman and Andrew VanWyngarden of the neo-psychedelic band MGMT; Jem Cohen, an independent film maker who has worked with R.E.M. and Fugazi, filmmaker Joss Whedon, Willie Garson, character actor in many movies and TV shows such as Sex and the City and White Collar (TV series), Himanshu Suri of the rap group Das Racist, Simon O'Connor of the band Stylophone and Amazing Baby, and Keenan Mitchell and Fareed Sajan of the band Bottle Up and Go. The script for the film PCU was written by Wesleyan students Adam Leff and Zak Penn, (not members but regulars at the house), and is derived from life and characters in that house at the time. The early scenes at the house in PCU refer to the older, formerly prestigious organization. On January 19, 2010, Eric Conger's play, The Eclectic Society premiered at the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. The play centers on a fraternity at an unnamed New England college in the early 1960s, as they collide with race, class, and gender issues, while a new world prepares to unfold under the JFK administration.

Picnic Day was first held on May 22, 1909. It has grown to be what is believed to be the largest student-run event in the United States, typically drawing more than 50,000 visitors. In 2009, around 125,000 visitors attended Picnic Daya new attendance record. The Picnic Day went virtual in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Events and attractions Most departments put on exhibitions, competitions, or presentations to introduce themselves to the public. Due in large part to UC Davis' reputation as one of the finest veterinary medicine institutions in the country, Picnic Day features dozens of exhibitions featuring animals, including the famed geep, a goat-sheep chimera. Other parts of the celebration include a parade, Dachshund racing, equestrian demonstrations, and a Battle of the Bands. Organization Picnic Day is organized by a board of directors consisting of 1820 students, ranging from different backgrounds and talents. Directors are full-time students and active participants of other extra-curricular activities and events in UC Davis. Every year, the board of directors selects a theme that will reflect the mission and vision of that year's Picnic Day. Parade marshals Since 1962, the board of directors elects one or more parade marshals to be the distinguished guest(s) of Picnic Day. A subcommittee of directors evaluates a pool of candidates from different backgrounds. In selecting the parade marshal(s), the subcommittee is looking for individual(s) who show commitment to their work, personify the current theme, represent Aggie Pride, have contributed to the campus and Davis community, and, most of all, are role models to society. Picnic Day has selected individuals engaged in the arts, sciences, politics and other fields. Safety concerns The size of the event has sparked some controversy. In 2010, there were 545 calls to police. Davis enacted a Safety Enhancement Zone (SEZ) around downtown and doubled fines for certain infractions committed on Picnic Day in the zone. In 2016, the SEZ was expanded. The northern margin of the zone was moved to Covell Blvd. (up from 8th St.) and the western margin was moved to State Route 113 (over from Anderson Rd.) There was one accidental death off campus during the 2011 event.

History Picnic Day events in the Northern Territory date back to the late 1800s. They were held in a variety of locations such as Adelaide River, Brunette Downs Station and Glencoe Paddock at differing times of year. A regular annual Union Picnic Day or Trade Picnic Day was observed at Adelaide River by railway employees working on the North Australia Railway. The date of the first event is not known. The event included Public Works employees on some occasions. Between 1926 and 1935 a railway Picnic Day event was not held. An attempt was made to revive the holiday in 1933, but it was not officially observed again until three years later. On Monday 5 October 1936, a train transported people from Darwin to Adelaide River, leaving at 7 am returning at 11 pm. The hotel at Adelaide River recorded record sales and the train was \\"forced to stop often as a number of male Darwin passengers fell off at various points along the line\\". The Harts Range Races in Central Australia are held each Picnic Day long weekend. The races began in 1946, when three brothers Bennett, Qinton and Kil Webb from Mount Riddock Station raced stockman Jack Schaber and the regional policeman Senior Constable Bob Darken over a distance of about a mile to the Ulgarna Yards to determine who had the fastest horse. The event inspired the first formal racing meet at Harts Range in November 1947. It became an annual event.

Home of the Treffry family since the thirteenth century, the original structure was a fifteenth-century tower, which was defended against the French in 1475 by Elizabeth Treffry. It was strengthened soon afterwards, largely rebuilt in the sixteenth century and remodelled in the nineteenth century, the east front dating mostly from 1817-1845. The house is not open to the public except on special occasions. History Place House is the seat of the Treffry family, and played an important role in defending the town against the marauding French. The tower is from the fifteenth century and it was here, in 1475, that Elizabeth Treffry led the defence. The tower was strengthened and largely rebuilt in the early sixteenth century. In 1731 John Treffry left the house, on his death, to his nephew William Toller, who took on the surname of Treffry ‚Äî in addition to his own ‚Äî by Act of Parliament.Deed Poll Office: Private Act of Parliament 1734 (8 Geo. 2). c. 16 In 1779 it again came into the possession of two sisters who were not direct descendants of the family After the death in 1808 of William Esco Treffry, it was inherited together with the family estates by his nephew Joseph Thomas Austen, a bachelor, who lived there with his mother. He changed his name by deed poll to Joseph Treffry in 1836. The house at this time was in a state of disrepair. Starting in 1813, he undertook much rebuilding and renovation, the work continuing for about thirty years. In 1820 he rebuilt the high tower that Elizabeth Treffry had defended so staunchly. He tried to incorporate as much as possible of the Tudor structure into his new building. The house was inherited by the Rev Edward Treffry in the nineteenth century. He is said to have been preaching a sermon when a wrecked vessel was reported. Being keen to share in the spoils, he told his congregation to remain seated while he made his way to the porch. Then saying \\"Right, now we can all start fair\\", he joined his congregation in sprinting to the shore. The house Place House was designated as a Grade I listed building on 13 March 1951. It is a large house built of stone, dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The south front has two storeys, each with five windows, and a pair of ornamented early sixteenth century bay windows. There are external turrets and a large square tower at the west end with a corbelled and battlemented parapet. The tower was built to replace an earlier tower which fell in the eighteenth century.  The garden  Madeline Agar designed the garden at Place House in the 1920's. The rose garden and the rockery are still in existence. In Literature Elizabeth Treffry's defence is commemorated in Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poem 'Fowey Harbour, and Polruan Castle, &c.;', published 1831.

They are widely carried by skiers, particularly cross-country skiers for use in case a skier is buried by an avalanche. When the owner sets out on a skiing descent, the transmitter is activated, causing the device to emit a low-power pulsed radio signal during the trip. Following an avalanche, if some members of the ski party are buried, the others may switch their transceivers from transmit into receive mode, allowing use as a radio direction finding device to search for signals coming from the lost skiers. The avalanche beacon is an active device powered by batteries; a ski suit may also contain a passive RECCO transponder sewn into the clothing. Early avalanche transceivers transmitted at 2.275 kHz. In 1986, the international frequency standard of 457 kHz was adopted, and this remains the standard today. Many companies manufacture transceivers that comply with this standard. An avalanche transceiver is not considered a preventive measure against possible avalanche burial, but rather it is a way to reduce the amount of time buried and in the end save their lives. History In 1968, Dr. John Lawton invented the first effective avalanche transceiver at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in Buffalo, New York, with the first units being sold in 1971 under the ‚ÄúSkadi‚Äù brand name (from the mythological Ska√∞i). This unit, functioning at 2.275 kHz, converted the radio frequency to a simple tone audible to the human ear. By following the tone to where it was loudest, the transceiver operator could use it to locate the buried transceiver by using a grid searching technique. In 1986, IKAR adopted the frequency of 457 kHz. In 1996 ASTM adopted the 457 kHz standard. The following are the currently accepted international standards for Avalanche Transceivers operating on the 457 kHz frequency. * 457 kHz, frequency tolerance ¬±80 Hz * 200 hours transmitting at +10C (assumed inside protective clothing) * 1 hours receiving at ‚àí10C (assumed handheld) * operation from ‚àí20C to +45C * carrier keying (pulse period) 1000¬±300 ms Now that the frequency 457 kHz had become an international standard, and the problems of range had been discussed and analyzed, everyone was most interested in ease of use. With a new generation of entirely automatic apparatuses existing on the market containing a microprocessor that analyzed the beacon's signals or pulses to determine both the direction and distance of the victim, a new digital age was born. In 1997, the first digital beacon was introduced at the Winter Outdoor Retailer show by Backcountry Access under the brand name \\"Tracker\\". The Tracker DTS soon became the most widely used beacon in North America, and is still sold and used by many backcountry enthusiasts. Today, consumers have a wide range of choices for digital beacons from companies like Ortovox, Arva, Pieps, Mammut, and Backcountry Access. Although beacon technology is constantly evolving and improving, practicing and being familiar with your beacon remains the most important aspect for performing timely rescues and preventing avalanche fatalities. Types of beacons Digital avalanche transceiver with LCD display There are two types of avalanche beacons: digital and analog. They both adhere to the international standard as described above, and only differ in the method(s) used to indicate to the user where the buried beacon is located. Most beacons currently being sold are digital, because of their enhanced ease of use and higher recovery rates. Analog The original avalanche beacon was an analog beacon which transmitted the pulsed signal as an audible tone to the user. The tone gets louder when the user is closer to the transmitting beacon. These beacons have also been augmented with LEDs that provide a visual indication of signal strength, and earpieces to increase the ability of the listener to hear the tone. Digital Digital transceivers take the strength of the signal and the emitted dipole flux pattern and compute distance and direction to the buried transceiver.ISSW 2000 In order to calculate the emitted dipole flux pattern, a digital transceiver must have at least two antennas, although most modern transceivers have three. The digital beacons will then indicate the direction to the victim's beacon as an arrow on the display, and provide audio cues such as varying pitch or frequency. Most low- to mid-range beacons have a segmented arrow capable of pointing in five to eight forward directions only, displaying a 'U-Turn' indicator if the user is traveling away from the victim. Higher end beacons such as the Mammut¬Æ Pulse Barryvox and Arva¬Æ Link are equipped with a digital compass and free- flowing arrow, facilitating more exact direction finding, even rotating to maintain direction between pulses of the transmitting beacon (a feature that is impossible without a digital compass or sophisticated accelerometer). In addition, many higher end beacons can point to victims 360¬∞, including behind the user if the user is moving in the wrong direction. Many digital beacons are also capable of being used in analog mode for more advanced rescuers, or to enhance reception range. W-Link Several high-end digital beacons are also equipped with a secondary \\"supplementary\\" frequency referred to as W-Link. This frequency broadcasts additional details to other transceivers capable of receiving the W-Link signal. Advertised brand-independent features of W-Link include: * The ability to resolve multiple, complex burial situations by better differentiating individual transceivers * More reliable estimation of the number of burials * More reliable and quicker marking/unmarking of victims (i.e. forcing the transceiver to ignore an already found victim) * More reliable selection of victim search, as the closest victim may not be the easiest to recover * Ability to transmit and receive additional data including wearer's vital signs or identification Vitals detection Beacons transmitting on the W-Link frequency send a specific device code to assist in isolating and pinpointing multiple signals, and facilitate all of the above features. Certain beacons like the Mammut¬Æ Pulse Barryvox also detect micro-movements in the user, including the minuscule movement generated by a heart beat. These beacons will transmit this information across the W-Link frequency, so that any user with another W-Link capable transceiver can determine whether or not a buried victim is alive, and formulate rescue triage based on that situation. The idea behind this is that if everyone in a group is wearing a vitals-capable W-Link transceiver and some group members are buried in an avalanche, the remaining group members will be able to determine which of the buried victims are still alive, and focus rescue efforts on those members. To compensate for group members without vitals-capable beacons (including lower-end beacons without W-Link and W-Link capable beacons without vitals detection), the rescuer's W-Link beacon will often display two indicators on the display for each victim. One indicator shows that a victim's beacon is transmitting on the W-Link frequency while another shows that the victim is moving. This helps mitigate the potential risk of mis-categorizing an alive victim as dead because their beacon is not transmitting vitals data, and thus the rescuer does not see the \\"alive\\" indicator on their transceiver. Controversies of W-Link As a universal rule, W-Link capable transceivers do not display personally identifiable characteristics of the buried victims, although they are capable of doing this. This is to eliminate conflicts of interest in rescue situations where a rescuer may choose to save one person before (or instead of) another, even if another person is closer or easier to rescue. By not identifying any buried victims, the rescuer is not left with a decision of which person to save, and are spared the moral implications and consequences of his or her choices. Critics of the W-Link system, especially of the vitals-detecting transceivers, argue that even without offering personally identifiable information, the W-Link transceivers still present moral implications, and complicate rescue efforts because these transceivers will distinguish between W-Link capable and incapable victims with an indicator on the display, further segregating victims with a vitals-data capable beacons. Critics argue that this leads to an unfair distribution of rescue resources and personnel to persons with higher-end or newer transceivers, and deprives everyone of an equal chance for rescue. For this reason transceiver manufacturer Arva Equipment has elected to omit received vitals data from being displayed on their Link transceiver, although the beacon does transmit them. A scenario that W-Link critics will use to exemplify their point is as follows: > A four-person group goes on a backcountry tour into avalanche terrain. A > husband and his wife are both equipped with the same W-Link, vitals-sensing > transceiver. They just met the other two group members the day before. One > of them has a basic digital beacon, and the other has a modern, digital > W-Link beacon that does not transmit vitals data. Along their tour, three of > the group members are caught in an avalanche, leaving only the husband to > rescue them. He quickly activates his transceiver and it gets a lock on all > three victims. The display shows two beacons 10 and 12 meters directly in > front of him, one with W-Link signal and one with regular signal only. It > also shows one beacon 33 meters behind him transmitting W-Link and vitals > data saying the victim is alive. In this scenario, it is clear to distinguish between all three victims even though the transceiver does not display their names; his wife is 33 meters behind him, while the other two people he just met are much closer, and close together, as well. The moral implications are that the man will either choose to save his wife, likely at the expense of the other two group members' lives, or he will choose to rescue one or both of the other group members, allowing his wife to die. In a rescue situation without the additional information, a competent rescuer would make the rational choice of initially rescuing the two closer victims. If the husband makes this choice, he will have chosen to not put his wife's life first, possibly resulting in her death, and will have to live with that for the rest of his life. Frequencies and technical information The W-Link frequency in use varies based on geographical location. Currently the frequencies are 869.8 MHz in Region A and 916-926 MHz in Region B. Region A consists of the majority of the European Union, Sweden, Norway, Greenland, Iceland, and other countries in that vicinity. Region B consists of Canada and the United States. W-Link frequencies are not permitted for use in Russia, China, India, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and other various countries in Asia and Eastern Europe. Users may disable W-Link capabilities on their individual beacon when traveling to these countries, although switching between Regions B and A may require servicing by an authorized retailer. Search techniques Due to the highly directional nature of the 457 kHz signal at the ranges common for avalanche burial (and the range specified in the standards), there have been many techniques developed to search for buried beacons. Good beacon search abilities are considered a required skill for recreational backcountry skiers, mountaineers as well as avalanche professionals such as ski guides, ski patrollers, search and rescue volunteers and professionals. Recreationalists and professionals alike take part in drills, practice and scenarios as a regular part of avalanche skills training. The burial of a single beacon may involve search using one of several methods: * Grid search * Induction search * Circle method These search methods are adapted and extrapolated to scenarios where there is more than one burial.

In Singapore, cars and other vehicles drive on the left side of the road‚Äîdue to its historical rule by the United Kingdom. As a result, most vehicles are right-hand drive. However, exemptions have been made to allow foreign vehicles and construction machineries to utilise the road space of Singapore. As such, vehicles with left-hand drive configurations are required to either be driven with a sign indicating \\"LEFT-HAND-DRIVE\\" or towed. The per-capita car ownership rate in Singapore is approximately 12 cars per 100 people (or 1 car per 8.25 people). History Geylang Road was one of the earliest roads built in Singapore. The earliest roads in Singapore, after its founding in 1819, were laid out in the Jackson Plan of 1822 in keeping with Sir Stamford Raffles's directions. A grid system was adopted for the town with roads for carriages being wide, and those for horses four yards wide. Pedestrian paths along the roadsides were two yards wide, allowing room for two people to walk abreast and giving rise to the five-foot ways that came to be associated with the sheltered walkways along roadside shops. These roads were fairly advanced for the time, with Macadam surfacing used on High Street as early as 1821. Roads were also constructed across the rest of the island, although they were usually unsurfaced. Most of the roads were accessible to the kampong roads by 1845, and finally to the HDB developed roads since the 1960s. Currently, there are a lot of roads and expressways in Singapore. The first motor car was introduced in Singapore in 1896. As with many other urban areas of the time, all the earliest modes of transport were replaced by today's transport. Driving licence=Obtaining a driving licence A class 3 or class 3A licence permits the holder to drive motorcars weighing less than 3,000 kg when unladen and to carry no more than seven passengers. In addition, the holder may drive a motor tractor or other motor vehicles with an unladen weight of less than 2,500 kg. A class 3A licence limits the holder to drive motor vehicles without a clutch pedal, typically automatic transmission cars, whereas a class 3 licence allows the holder to drive all motor vehicles. Class 3A drivers are not allowed to drive manual transmission cars. Drivers must be 18 years old to qualify for a licence including applying for theory lessons. Once a driver passes the Basic Theory Test (BTT), a Provisional Driving Licence (PDL) which lasts for six months before December 2017, 2 years validity after 1 December 2017, must be applied before taking the practical driving lesson. It is an offence to learn to drive without a valid PDL licence. However, a student can choose to apply and pass the Final Theory Test (FTT) before applying for a PDL and starting driving lessons. The last stage of obtaining a driving licence is the practical driving test, for which a student must have a FTT pass result slip and a valid PDL. Failure to do so will cause the test to be rejected by the Traffic Police Tester. The driving theory tests consist of 50 questions to be answered within 50 minutes; to pass, you must answer 45 out of the 50 questions correctly. Results are shown immediately after the test on the same touchscreen monitor. Foreign drivers in Singapore The Singapore Traffic Police require foreigners residing in Singapore to have a valid foreign driver's licence and to be at least 18 years old. Conversion to a Singaporean licence is often possible for certain classes of vehicles. Foreigners who have obtained a Singapore licence are supplied with a limited-duration licence which needs to be renewed between one month before expiry to three years after expiry. After this period, the conversion procedure or licensing theory and practical tests must be taken all over again. All foreigners visiting or residing in Singapore will need to produce an IDP (International Driving Permit) produced by their home country with an English Driving Licence. The IDP (International Driving Permit) lasts for a year. However, Countries under ASEAN are exempt from carrying an IDP. Foreigners must present both a valid Singapore Driving License and Employment Pass/FIN card with at least 6 months of validity. Licence renewal No renewal of a driving licence is required for Singapore citizens and permanent residents since the introduction of the photocard licence. The driving licence is for the normal lifespan of the person and can be surrendered upon request to the Traffic Police. If the person passes away, the licence will have to be surrendered to the Traffic Police for cancellation, similar to National Registration Identity Card (NRIC). It is an offence for any persons to continue or to possess or use any other person's identity cards listed above without authorization. A person who commits 12 demerit points and is above 80 years old is subject to early termination of the driving licence indefinitely. Additionally, no new drivers over 79 years old are accepted. Random medical check-up screenings will be required for those over 62 years old for all drivers that still want to drive. For Class 4, 5, bus and taxi driving licences, annual medical check-ups are done from 70 years old all the way to 80. The upper age limit is 81. Riding motorcycles registered on a different holder In Singapore, it is illegal to ride a motorcycle if the rider's name is not entered in the insurance contract. For each motorcycle, only one co- rider can be entered, but the procedure to change the co-rider is comparatively quick and easy. The only exception is commercial insurance, where any rider can use the vehicle. Only a business registered company can register for a commercial insurance. Driver Improvement Points System The Driver Improvement Points System (DIPS) is a system whereby demerit points will be added to the driver's record. The system is meant to deter drivers from infringing the rules-of-the-road and, if they do, suspend their driving licence for a period of time. This system requires offenders to retest and pass the driving test again from the beginning. If a driver accumulates 24 demerit points within a period of two years, he/she will be suspended from driving for three months. If he/she had been suspended before, he/she will only be allowed to accumulate less than 12 demerit points in a period of 12 months. It is a driving licence scheme where those foreigners who have their licence suspended will have their licences affected, as this is from other countries. A driving licence is a statutory requirement and is commonly used worldwide. Currently, drivers are given demerit points if they commit certain traffic offences such as speeding and passengers not fastening their seat belts. Roads in Singapore=Electronic Road Pricing ERP gantry The Land Transport Authority (LTA) in Singapore implemented an Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) scheme to deter traffic congestion during peak hours at various roads. The ERP scheme requires electronic gantries to be placed over the road at designated locations and that cars be equipped with an In-Vehicle Unit (IU), a rectangular device pasted on the inside bottom right of the front windscreen from the driver's view, which will deduct the toll price from a CashCard. The CashCard must be inserted into the device, and failure to do so is in violation of the law. There is no charge for entering the area during certain non-peak times. Parking The cost of parking in many upgraded car parks can be deducted from the CashCard inserted in the IU of the vehicle, thus eliminating the need for the car park to have an attendant. Although the cost of parking (which is published) is variable, parking costs tend to be much less expensive compared to London and New York. For example, the Centrepoint shopping centre charges a mere S$1 (approximately US$0.70) for the first hour, whereas garages in New York on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street charge between US$12 and US$26 for one hour. Some car parks in Singapore are equipped with sensors that can detect whether the position is filled or not. This information is processed and displayed in signs around the car park, directing drivers to areas where there are free spaces. ‚ÄòSeason Parking‚Äô is an initiative created by the Housing & Development Board (HDB) for motorists to engage in long-term parking of their vehicles in HDB car parks. There are several types of season parking in Singapore. Road signs During British colonial rule, Singapore's road rules and legislature which govern the design and layout of the road signs were directly imported from Britain. As such, most road signs in Singapore are similar to those in the UK. For example, warning signs are depicted as red triangles and mandatory regulative signs are depicted as blue circles. However, several aspects of road signage and traffic-calming measures adopted locally developed standards after independence. Major deviations are as follows: 1\\\\. A locally developed typeface is favoured for the road signs over the Transport typeface which was adopted in Britain. 2\\\\. In 1998, a system of black-on-yellow \\"curve alignment markers\\" was widely adopted and gradually replaced the British system of using white-on-black sharp deviation signs to delineate sharp turns. A few of the British-system signs were kept such as in Mandai Road and Suntec City. 3\\\\. In the late 1990s, all the circular regulatory signs and triangular warning signs were mounted to a one-size-fits-all square white backing board to improve visibility against a complex background like trees. 4\\\\. In the early 2000s, signs at road works were made usually black-on-orange and diamond- or rectangular-shaped, similar to the Taiwanese system. Most roads, bridges, roundabouts, and tunnels are marked with signposts bearing the name of the road. The expressways in Singapore are not numbered (unlike in most other countries), but are named. Road signs abbreviate the full name of the expressway with three representative letters, such as PIE for the Pan Island Expressway or ECP for the East Coast Parkway, respectively. Almost all road signs in Singapore are in English although many road names have a Malay origin. Typically, \\"Jalan\\" is used for \\"Road\\" and \\"Lorong\\" is used for \\"Lane\\". Multilingual road signs exist, especially for historically ethnic enclaves like Chinatown or Little India, or for landmarks. For example, some directional signs pointing to Chinese or Hindu temples are bilingual or trilingual (English, Chinese, or Tamil). Bilingual signage dates to the early days of Singapore. 5\\\\. Curiously enough, even on the larger signs, road names are rarely spelt out in full. For example, \\"road\\" is almost always \\"Rd\\" (\\"Avenue\\" as \\"Ave\\", \\"Bukit\\" as \\"Bt\\", \\"Boulevard\\" as \\"Blvd\\", \\"Close\\" as \\"Cl\\", \\"Central\\" as \\"Ctrl\\", \\"Crescent\\" as \\"Cres\\", \\"Drive\\" as \\"Dr\\", \\"Jalan\\" as \\"Jln\\", \\"Kampong\\" as \\"Kg\\", \\"Lane\\" as \\"Ln\\", \\"Lorong\\" as \\"Lor\\", \\"Upper\\" as \\"Upp\\", \\"Place\\" as \\"Pl\\", \\"Saint\\" and \\"Street\\" as \\"St\\", \\"Tanjong\\" as \\"Tg\\"). Exceptions include roads that end with less common words, such as \\"walk\\", \\"hill\\", and \\"park\\". Left turn or right turn at a red traffic light Left Turn In Singapore, it is illegal to turn left (into the nearest lane, due to the left- hand driving) during a red light. This rule, however, does not apply if a \\"Left Turn on Red\\" sign is present at the junction, allowing left-turning motorists to turn left, provided they stop before the stop line and give way to pedestrians and incoming traffic. Right Turn It is illegal to turn right during a red light in Singapore. Right turns are permissible only when one's lane has the green light signal and the opposing traffic lane, travelling in the opposite direction, is clear and favourable to execute a right turn. However, green turning signals (the outline of a right-pointing arrow) are installed onto some traffic lights. These rules in Singapore are similar to many countries that employ left-hand traffic, and unlike countries which permit turns on red. Special Roads Due to the limited land space in Singapore, selected roads, especially those with more lanes have been specially designated as runways for aircraft in the event of an emergency or when needs arise. Traffic safety=Driving safety Driving after consuming alcohol, using a phone while driving, dangerous driving, and car racing are all illegal. All offenders will face disqualification and be prosecuted in court. Car safety crash tests The Singapore government accepts the crash safety standards of the EU and Japan. Cars made in the EU and Japan do not need to pass additional safety standards to be sold in Singapore. Cars may be privately imported into Singapore if they have an EU Certificate of Conformity or the Japanese Completion Inspection Certificate, both of which incorporate emissions and safety standards. Not all cars sold in Singapore have been tested by the EuroNCAP, a car-safety testing organisation jointly operated by several European government agencies, that crash tests cars that can be legally sold in several European countries. Buying a car Many regulations concerning buying and driving a car are administered by the Land Transport Authority, the successor to the Registry of Vehicles. Certificate of Entitlement New car buyers are required to buy a Certificate of Entitlement (COE), which is valid for ten years. The typical car lifespan is 17 years. Extension for two or three years of the typical car lifespan is only for those who have special difficulties. Car buyers can scrap the car earlier than the typical car lifespan. The term \\"bidding\\" is often used, but in practice new car dealers assist in the process. The fee of each COE is added on to the costs of a new car based on engine size‚ÄîCategory A is 1,600 cc engine and below; Category B is 1,601 cc engine and above‚Äîand is generally lower for Category A vehicles. There are provisions for a rebate of the COE if the car is scrapped before 10 years. Preferential Additional Registration Fee A car owner may apply for a portion of the Preferential Additional Registration Fee (PARF) if a car is de-registered before 10 years. The term \\"Additional Registration Fee (ARF)\\" is calculated from 110% of Open Market Value (OMV). If a car is less than 5 years old, then the PARF is 75% of the ARF. Open Market Value The Open Market Value (OMV) of a vehicle is determined by Singapore customs and is equivalent to the price of the car, including freight and other incidental charges. Licence plates Licence plate Vehicle licence plates in Singapore are the same 520 mm √ó 110 mm size found in many European countries. Red licence plates indicate that the car may be driven only during off-peak times unless a daily fee is paid. Off-peak times are from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. on weekdays and all day on Saturdays and Sundays. Since the end of January 2010, off-peak car usage is no longer restricted on Saturday, Sunday, and the days before public holidays. Off-peak licence plates cost less than regular ones. Standard licence plates in Singapore are usually black with silver or white lettering or the newer white front/yellow rear plate combination and Off-peak licence plates are white on red. Car market=Domestic car market Car brands are typically sold by only one dealer although there are rare exceptions where two dealers sell the same brand. Several dealers have more than one location. Some dealers sell more than one brand, unlike the situation in some western European countries in the past where some manufacturers prohibited dealers from selling competing brands. Negotiation during car purchases is customary but limited due to the lack of competing dealers. The limited size of the Singapore market results in some brands not offering the full model line in Singapore. Unlike in Australia, where the US Honda Accord and the Japanese Honda Accord (re-badged as the Acura TSX in the United States) are sold, only the Japanese Honda Accord is sold in Singapore. Some brands, such as Saab and Volvo (except the Volvo S60R) are only offered with automatic transmission even though manual transmission cars are sold in the car's home market. Although car prices are high, servicing costs are reasonable compared to in the United States and Western Europe in terms of labour charges. Sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pick-up trucks are not as common in Singapore as in the United States and Canada. So, pick-up trucks in Singapore are relatively expensive compared to other Southeast Asian countries, and some dealerships do not import pick-up trucks like the Volkswagen Amarok and Thai-built Ford Ranger at all. Toyota Corolla Altis Japanese car manufacturers have the largest market share. Some Japanese cars are imported from countries other than Japan. For example, the Toyota Vios is imported from Thailand, whereas the JDM version is called Toyota Belta. Initially, the ninth generation Toyota Corolla sold in Singapore was a Japanese model, while the facelift version is a wider and longer Corolla Altis from Thailand. Subaru R2 Kei cars (like the Mitsubishi i, Subaru R2, and Suzuki Carry) are common in Singapore, but not as popular as in Japanese domestic market as most Japanese car manufacturers seldom release Kei cars in Singapore. Besides this, there are some grey imports of Kei cars like Daihatsu Copen. European car manufacturers are well represented. On the more expensive segment of the market, European cars sold in Singapore include Aston Martin, Alfa Romeo, Mercedes, BMW, and others. Skoda, Fiat, Renault, Peugeot and Citroen are among the less expensive European cars sold in Singapore. American cars have a low market share. Chrysler, Tesla, and Jeep vehicles are sold in Singapore, such as the Chrysler 300C, Tesla Model X, Dodge Caliber, and Jeep Wrangler. Chevrolet markets only Korean-made Daewoo cars, but not its American-made models. Ford markets some cars from its European line, not its American product line. Even Subaru, a Japanese carmaker, did not do well with cars made by a US-based subsidiary, Subaru of Indiana Automotive, which exported the US-made Tribeca to Singapore. Non-Japanese Asian car brands sold in Singapore include Perodua, Proton, Ssangyong, Hafei Motor, Chery, Geely, Kia, Hyundai, Chana, and Holden Special Vehicles. Used cars that are more than three years old cannot be imported into Singapore. Aftermarket Because Singapore does not have a domestic automobile industry and thus has a very small domestic market for remanufactured and reconditioned auto parts, it has become an especially important aftermarket for businesses exporting automotive parts and accessories. This is magnified by high automobile turnover, a preference for new parts, and high demand for \\"accessories, car-care products, prestige items, and new spare parts\\". In fact, Singapore has become a major automotive components manufacturing base, as several leading multinational corporations (MNCs) have established international procurement offices as well as their Southeast Asia distribution centres. Singapore as an automobile exporter The peculiarities of Singapore's car market has made Singapore the second largest exporter of used cars in the world (approximately 100,000 cars exported per year) after Japan. Singapore exports its cars to many countries, including African countries. Used cars are often exported to other countries with right-hand driving, but there are exports to left-hand-driving countries as well. New Zealand allows used cars previously registered in Singapore to be imported without any modifications. This is due in part to the reduction in the costs of COE and PARF between 2000 and 2005, which has incentivised owners to purchase new cars before their ten years are up. Previously, the COE and PARF represented around 80% of the cost of a medium-priced car like the Honda Accord. With the COE and PARF less expensive than in the past, in some cases the yearly drop in the COE and PARF rebate becomes significant compared to the pre-tax (OMV) price of a new car. Furthermore, with the PARF rebate starting to diminish after a car is five years old, the net amount of credit (similar to resale value or trade-in value) compared to the OMV becomes less favourable for owners of older cars. In contrast, in countries with low taxes, the most economical ownership strategy is to keep a car as long as possible until repair costs exceed a new car's depreciation costs or financing costs.\\"Should You Keep Your Old Car?\\" , Kiplinger.com Right-hand drive vehicles In Singapore, only right-hand-drive cars are permitted on the roads. There are exceptions for special-purpose vehicles, diplomatic vehicles, and foreign- registered vehicles, with the label placed at the back windscreen of the vehicles indicating \\"Left Hand Drive\\" to alert other motorists that the driver's seat is on the left side instead of on the right side. Retail petrol market In 2017, there were about 170 petrol stations across the city- state, a decrease from 222 stations in 2013. Many were closed as they were either deemed a security risk or the license had lapsed. These stations operate under brands of five multinational companies, with no independent retailers. The petrol station network is largely operated by four incumbent retailers: Royal Dutch Shell, retailing petrol under the brand \\"Shell\\", ExxonMobil, retailing petrol under the brand \\"Esso\\", Chevron, retailing petrol under the brand \\"Caltex\\", and Singapore Petroleum Company, retailing petrol under the brand \\"SPC\\". The incumbent retailers are vertically integrated, with their supplies of refined petrol coming from their refineries situated at Jurong Island. Potential new entrants to the market face high barriers to entry in form of additional premiums paid to acquire retail petrol sites that are planned for by Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and tendered out by Housing and Development Board (HDB). It was also determined that for a viable retail petrol operation in Singapore, a new entrant would need to operate minimally 30 sites, which is hard to achieve at the average rate of 2.4 new tenders per anuum. In 2017, Sinopec won the bids for two retail sites, with the first site coming into operation in November 2018. Four grades of petrol are commonly sold in Singapore. Diesel and unleaded petrol with octane levels of 92, 95 and 98 are widely sold. Octane levels conform with European octane ratings and roughly correspond to American octane levels of 87, 90, and 93, respectively. Shell also market a fifth brand of fuel under the V-Power label, in addition to 98 octane petrol. 98 octane V-Power is marketed as having an FMT additive and \\"formulated to improve performance and responsiveness\\", and sells for approximately 15 cents per litre more than Shell's other 98 octane fuel.http://www.shell.com/home/Framework?siteId=sg-en&FC2;=/sg- en/html/iwgen/shell_for_motorists/fuels/discounts/zzz_lhn.html&FC3;=/sg- en/html/iwgen/shell_for_motorists/fuels/discounts/price_board_0720.html Retrieved 26 April 2007. Reference notes price of 16 April 2007 It was reported that the retailers enjoy a high level of brand loyalty among customers due to convenience of station locations, credit/debit card promotions, brand loyalty programmes, and low prices among other factors. As the retailers base their pricing strategy for retail petrol around the price at which petrol retailers purchase the refined wholesale petrol from the refineries, or also known as Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS) prices, retailers have similar pricing to each other. However, it is observed that the changes in retail pricing across retailer happen at different times, with \\"no observable pricing pattern, such as a clear price leader, either for price increases or price decreases\\". Where there was convergence in the pricing, it is due to petrol retailers regularly monitor and react to each other's published retail petrol prices and associated promotions in an effort to retain customers or to win new customers. With the additional application of discounts and rebates afforded through credit/debit cards promotions and brand loyalty scheme, consumers are able to enjoy a differentiation of petrol prices in the market. However, such schemes are complicated and make direct price comparison difficult. Petrol is cheaper in Malaysia than in Singapore, but arbitrage opportunities are limited because cars registered in Singapore crossing over into Malaysia are legally required to have at least three- quarters of a tank of fuel. Foreign assessment of Singapore motoring The Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) submitted a report on Singapore's Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system to the World Bank. The report praised ERP as fair, convenient, reliable, and effective in congestion reduction. It also described its positive ramifications such as revenue collection and pollution control. An expatriate advice website states that driving and owning a car in Singapore is very expensive. Wired described Singapore as a \\"living laboratory for Intelligent Transport Systems, a catchall phrase for high-tech strategies to gather data, manage flow, and inform drivers of congestion ahead\\", noting that traffic \\"does indeed move noticeably smoother here than in American metropolitan areas of comparable size‚ÄîAtlanta, for instance.\\"  Measures to reduce vehicle usage  Several steps have to be completed before a car-owner can drive a vehicle in Singapore. A Certificate of Entitlement (COE) is required, costing more than S$80,000 to successful bidders. This permits ownership of the vehicle for a period of 10 years after which the vehicle must be scrapped or another COE paid for allowing an additional 5 or 10 years of usage. COE is technically a lease at an inflated cost. Only ten-year COEs may be further renewed to another 7‚Äì10 years and no extension of the car is given. Historic vehicles are exempted from these requirements. Certain roads and expressways in Singapore are subject to the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system. COEs and the ERP system are intended to encourage people to use public transport such as the MRT and public buses instead of driving. The increasing parking charges in HDB carparks from 1 December 2016 in electronic parking and selected season parking also deter people from driving and encouraged to take public transport.

Palmer is a former Madison Guaranty land appraiser and pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges related to Whitewater. He was later pardoned by President, Bill Clinton. As a land appraiser he admitted to conspiring with Jim McDougal and others with Madison Guaranty savings association. The case was part of the Whitewater property, which Bill Clinton and Jim McDougal originally purchased in 1978. The conspiracy was to inflate the estimates used for the loans. Kenneth Starr's investigators were also told that Palmer inflated estimates used to support loans made to Gov. Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas. The false land appraisals made Madison Guaranty's books look better than they were. Mr. Palmer did about 90 percent of the appraisals for Madison and that about 90 percent of those were inflated. Madison records showed one appraisal was for a $1.05 million loan to Tucker and an associate to buy a water and sewer system for real estate development known as Castle Grande. Later appraisals found the system to be worth about 1/2 of the loan, when the loan went into default it was one of the largest losses for Madison. David Hale, former Arkansas municipal judge and banker, has told investigators that a Palmer's appraisal and later loan for Etta's Place restaurant and two other lots for $825,000 from Madison that helped shore up his finances. Hale handled federally insured loans in Little Rock for the Small Business Administration. The loan helped him to issue an improper SBA loan to Mrs. McDougal. Hale said he made the $300,000 loan because of pressure from Gov. Clinton and Mr. McDougal. Mr. Clinton has denied his claim. Starting in 1982 McDougal operated Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan. On April 14, 1997, McDougal was convicted of 18 felony counts of fraud conspiracy charges. The counts had to do with bad loans made by Madison, the S&L; failed in the late 1980s. As his Savings and loan was Federal insured the bad loans ($68 million) were at the end paid by the taxpayers. Palmer pleaded guilty on December 6, 1994 to Federal charges of conspiracy.

It has been isolated from a variety of plant sources and is being studied for its variety of pharmacological properties.  History  Apocynin was first described by Oswald Schmiedeberg, a German pharmacologist, in 1883 and was first isolated by Horace Finnemore, in in 1908, from the root of Canadian hemp (Apocynum cannabinum). At the time, this plant was already used for its known effectiveness against edema and heart problems. In 1971, apocynin was also isolated from Picrorhiza kurroa, a small plant that grows at high altitudes in the western Himalayas. P. kurroa was used for ages as a treatment for liver and heart problems, jaundice, and asthma. In 1990, Simons et al. isolated apocynin to a pharmacologically useful level using an actively guided isolation procedure. Apocynin's observed anti- inflammatory capabilities proved to be a result of its ability to selectively prevent the formation of free radicals, oxygen ions, and peroxides in the body. Apocynin has since been extensively studied to help determine its disease-fighting capabilities and applications.  Physical properties  Apocynin is a solid with a melting point of 115 ¬∞C and the faint odor of vanilla. It is soluble in hot water, alcohol, benzene, chloroform, and ether.  Mode of action  NADPH oxidase is an enzyme that effectively reduces O2 to superoxide (O2‚Äì‚Ä¢), which can be used by the immune system to kill bacteria and fungi. Apocynin is an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase activity and thus is effective in preventing the production of the superoxide in human white blood cells or neutrophilic granulocytes. It does not however obstruct the phagocytic or other defense roles of granulocytes. Due to the selectivity of its inhibition, apocynin can be widely used as an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase without interfering in other aspects of the immune system. Apocynin was used to determine whether ionic activation due to proton flux across the membrane of renal medulla cells was coupled to NADPH oxidase production of superoxide. Apocynin was introduced to the cells and completely blocked the production of superoxide, and was a key component in determining that the proton outflow was responsible for the activation of NADPH oxidase. The mechanism of action of apocynin is not understood. In the experimental studies, apocynin is shown to dimerize and form diapocynin. Although, diapocynin seems to have beneficial effect in reducing reactive oxygen species and anti-inflammatory properties, it is still yet to be shown as biologically relevant molecule. Biotransformation of apocynin predominantly leads to glycosylated form of apocynin. Another molecule that is shown to form under experimental conditions is nitroapocynin.  Research  Small scale early stage clinical trials for apocynin were conducted for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 2011 and asthma in 2012 but they did not progress any further. Other preliminary pre-clinical research includes: * Anti-arthritic: Neutrophils are a key component of the pathogenesis of collagen-induced arthritis and in the mechanisms that lead to the start of inflammation of the joints. The action of apocynin reduces the presence of such cells before the inflammation has begun but it is unable to reverse inflammation that is already present. * Bowel disease: Apocynin treatment in rats has been proven to lessen damage in the colon as well as the enzymatic activity of myeloperoxidase which is associated with inflammation. In addition, apocynin also decreased the number of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the colon. * Anti-asthmatic: The glucoside of apocynin, androsin, is being investigated for the treatment of asthma for has been shown to prevent bronchial obstruction in guinea pigs. It is believed that the anti-asthmatic quality of apocynin comes from its interference with certain inflammatory processes. * Atherosclerosis: Apocynin is used in the treatment of atherosclerosis in order to prevent the activity of NADPH oxidase activity, halting the production of reactive oxygen species. In effect, this inhibition stops initiation of disease in the endothelial cells. * Familial ALS: Apocynin extended the lives of mutant mice and reduced glial cell toxicity of cultured cells lines with a defective superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene‚Äîa genetic defect found in some people with hereditary amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease). Researchers believe the benefit derives from a newly discovered role for SOD1 as a self- regulating redox sensor for NADPH oxidase-derived O2‚Ä¢ production. The findings in mice may point to new drug targets for hereditary ALS. * Skin stem cells: Apocynin promotes the synthesis of collagen 17 and by doing this it increases the survival of the mother cells derived from stem cells.

The U of S is the largest education institution in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The structure is an example of a university building in the classic Elizabethan E shape in Collegiate Gothic style which was designed by Brown and Vallance. This style is also seen at Cambridge, and Oxford and American universities such as Princeton. Strathcona Medical Building at McGill University was another collegiate gothic style campus building, also designed by Vallance & Brown, as well as Hart House at the University of Toronto. In 1909, Montreal architects named Vallance & Brown designed the University of Saskatchewan Campus. They set out six college gothic style residential and college buildings around a green space which has come to be known as The Bowl The University of Saskatchewan location next to the South Saskatchewan River was across from the city centre of Saskatoon. Prime Minister of Canada Sir Wilfrid Laurier laid the cornerstone of the first under construction building on campus, the College Building, on July 29, 1910. The original buildings were built using native limestone - greystone - which was mined just north of campus. Over the years, the greystone was to become one of the most recognizable campus signatures. When the local supply of limestone was exhausted, the University turned to Tyndall Stone, so called because it is quarried at Tyndall, Manitoba. The College Building, officially opened May 1, 1913. This building had the first cornerstone laid in 1910, but was not the first building on campus. However the Professor of Field Husbandry residence, finished construction in 1911, and the Dean of Agriculture residence, now the Faculty Club, finished construction in 1912. In 2001, it was declared a National Historic Site of Canada. Gargoyles, oriel windows, and a gothic arch decorate the two storey fa√ßade. It had to be shut down in 1997 to undergo restoration. Cochrane Engineering and Friggstad Downing architects completed the construction and the College building was reopened 2005. The College building originally contained the Nobel Plaza, second floor Memorial Plaques, machinery toom and convocation hall and now houses two art galleries and a museum. The first rooms were used for students pursuing a Degree in Agriculture and they could learn to test milk, make butter and ripen cheese. The Honourable Lorne Calvert, Premier of Saskatchewan and U of S President, Peter MacKinnon rededicated the College Building September 6, 2005.

Synopsis A widowed queen urges her son, Emilien, to marry, but he does not. She dies. One day, he sees a portrait of the Princess Emilienne and falls in love. The portrait painter tells him that the princess is kept confined in a tower by a fairy. Emilien confides in a trusted servant, Jean, and after Jean makes secret preparations, they set out to find the princess. They take turns keeping watch at night. While the prince sleeps, Jean hears voices talking. One is of Father Roquelaure, who tells how Prince Emilien's task of finding the princess will be hard. He will have to rub the wheels with moss to cross a river with no bridge, which will create a bridge; he will have to offer the fairy a distaff with diamonds and then give her a sleeping potion; when he takes the princess, his horses will refuse to go on, and he will have to refuse offers from coachmen with horses and carriages and instead dash them to pieces; when the princess becomes thirsty and vendors offer to sell her drinks, the drinks will be poison and he will have to dash them to the ground; they will come upon a drowning man, and the prince will have to push him back into the water rather than rescue him; finally, he will have to rub the wheels with moss again. And if he repeats any of the things he has just been told, Jean will turn to stone. Throughout their journey, Jean tells Emilien to trust him and implements Father Roquelaure's words. His actions so frighten the princess that she tells Emilien that if he loved her, he would imprison Jean. After they return home and marry, Emilien demands that Jean explain his actions or be imprisoned. Jean finally explains and is turned to stone. The prince is deeply grieved. Within a year, the princess has a son, whom the prince wishes to name Jean in honor of his servant. A poor old woman comes to the christening feast, and so that no one will be unhappy there, he gives her a place and food to eat. She tells them that if they kill their baby, his blood will restore Jean. The prince kills the baby, and the blood brings Jean back to life. The old woman produces a magic wand and revives the baby. The princess realizes that she is the fairy who had kept her in the tower, and begs her pardon. The fairy tells her to be happy.

It was established in 1969-70, predating the founding of its containing national park (est. 1973). Though only 10 km2 in area, the site has provided valuable research. The station is situated on the shore of an oxbow lake, from which it takes its name. \\"Qucha\\" (in hispanicized spelling cocha) is the Quechua word for lake. \\"Cashu\\" is derived from the English word \\"cashew\\" and refers to the shape of the lake. Environmental Makeup The area is geographically diverse, consisting of grasslands bordering the Andes, gorges, and plains where climate is more variant and drier. The oxbow lake itself contributes areas of marsh and brushland. This is a nutrient-rich site, the soil consisting of silt and sand, and turnover along the riverbank occurs generally within 1000 years. The annual rainfall average is somewhat over 2000 mm, most of this falling from November to May. A marked dry season is from June to August. These factors combined lend to a relatively rapidly changing landscape. Those areas which lie outside the path of the Rio Manu's meandering edges have vegetation much older than those closer to the river, but due to common treefall, the forest canopy is low. Much of the forest is only 25‚Äì30 meters tall, with a number of trees extending outside this range at 50 meters tall or more. An extensive network of lianas extends across the understory. Patches of bamboo, totaling almost a third of the locality, are marked by a scarcity of trees. Research Along with La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica and Barro Colorado Island (BCI) managed by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama, Cocha Cashu is one of the best-studied ecological sites in the tropics. However, unlike La Selva or BCI, Cocha Cashu is in an area minimally impacted by humans, surrounded by millions of hectares of virgin forest, and thus provides critical insights into the organisms and processes found in a healthy, natural tropical rainforest. Over 500 articles, books, and other publications have resulted from field research conducted at Cocha Cashu. Studies related to those done at Cocha Cashu has been conducted at nearby Pakitza, on the same bank of Rio Manu, 21 km ESE. The two areas are very similar in makeup, reside at nearly the same elevation, and are not disconnected to impede species movement. Cocha Brunfelsia Flora The Rio Manu area, in 1990, was found to consist of 1,856 species of vegetation, in comparison to the 2,874 species found in the entire national park. Much of the forest is dominated by trees and shrubs, rather than having a considerable population of epiphytes and terrestrial herbs. It is thought that this inequality may be due to either lack of intensive collection of these smaller flora, or due to scarce precipitation outside of the rainy season. Leguminosae (legumes) is the outstanding family of flora species makeup, with over 90 species. Moraceae, Rubiaceae, and Pteridophyta follow, with over 50 documented species each. Although no particular species of flora found at the Manu site was considered endemic to the area in 1990, it was suggested that the rate of forest loss might soon have created endemism. Annual production of seeds and fruit is high and well supports the site's animal communities. It has been considered that this may be in some significant part due to the prevalence of strangler figs, which make up a high proportion of the taller trees embedded within the canopy. FaunaBirds= While the uncovering of the bird community dynamics of this area of the Amazon lagged behind other Amazonian sections, Cocha Cashu is considered a center of avian endemism (as identified by Haffer in 1985). Mist-net sampling of the bird populations at the site began in 1973, and by 1990, data on 435 regularly occurring species had been collected. Insectivorous species dominate overall with 163 species, though many of these appear in the understory. Birds with a near-exclusive fruit diet numbered 58, occurring most often in canopies along with omnivores. Common species include hummingbirds, manakins, and trumpeters. =Herps= Initial studies at Cocha Cashu centered on the black caiman (Melanosuchus niger), and thus this is the only species of herpetofauna thoroughly studied (as of 1990). It is thought, however, that the makeup herp communities might be very similar in Manu to that of other areas along the western Amazon Basin. Even with only the limited studies done on herpetofauna here, there appears to be a high diversity of species. In 2008, a study was conducted on amphibians at nine sites near Madre de Dios, one of these being Cocha Cashu. Results of this research found that 78 of the 114 species (68%) studied were found around the station, a nationally recognized protected area, while only 7.9% of the species observed were found outside of protected areas. These results stress the importance of national protection to the conservation of species diversity. =Mammals= Cocha Cashu's large mammal communities, due to being within a protected park, have not felt the effects of hunting which have damaged other Neotropical communities. This makes Manu a good place to study how tropical species communities may have looked and functioned before the influx of humans and technology. This is particularly relevant when studying jaguars, tapirs, ocelots, capybaras, giant otters, spider monkeys, woolly monkeys, and peccaries, as these populations have been highly hunted elsewhere. While fairly comprehensive lists of mammalian diversity at Cocha Cashu exist, most are over ten years old and may not be in line with current conditions. As of 1990, 70 nonflying mammal species had been recorded at the site, the majority of these being fruit-pulp eaters. Rodents were the most common category of mammals, with 24 species. Primates consisted of 13 species, carnivores of 12 species, and marsupials of 8 species. Together, these four groups made up over 80% of total identified species. Members of the family Felidae were found in surprising abundance, compared to other Neotropical sites. The effect of tree gaps, an important factor in the study of tropical ecology, was studied at Cocha Cashu in reference to small mammals (rodents). No difference was found in the fruit feeding habits of either species studied between gap and understory areas, but were found to consume more fruit in the rainy season, when fruit was more abundant, than in the dry season. Another paper based in the area proposes that these rodents are important assistants to the dispersal of mycorrhizal fungi, an important plant mutualist partner, in lowland Peruvian wet forest. The discussion of this study suggests the results may be applied generally to Neotropical areas. Other Research An intense storm event in 1994 in Cocha Cashu's locale prompted study of the effects of such storms on tropical forests. This particular event had been the most severe recorded within the 15 years prior. Wind knocked down 40 recorded trees, not counting those that had been felled by nearby treefall. These tended to be individuals that were emergent over the canopy, and the presence of root buttresses did not appear to affect whether the individual was susceptible to toppling due to these gusts. History The Cocha Cashu Biological Station was established in the 1960s by German researchers studying black caiman. Because it is within Man√∫ National Park, the station is officially owned and regulated by INRENA, Peru's National Natural Resources Institute. The station has been operated by John Terborgh, an environmental science professor at Duke University, since 1973. Facilities The remote, rustic station consists of a few thatched roofed buildings clustered in two small clearings, and a well-established network of trails into the forest. There are no dormitories or other forms of housing. All researchers, staff, and visitors must sleep in their own tents, on tent platforms, in the surrounding forest. Additionally, there are also no fixed plumbing systems. Toilets consist of a pair of pit latrines. Water for drinking, cooking, bathing, and washing clothes is pumped by hand from the lake. The lake offers canoes and a kayak for researchers to use, and solar panels allow for electricity in the laboratory of the station. The Internet is available in hour long slots for four people at a time. Access Cocha Cashu is only accessible by boat or float plane. The nearest roads reach the towns of Shintuya and Atalaya, two days away by boat. Flights to Boca Man√∫ still require a day-long boat ride up the Man√∫ River to reach the station. Many flora and fauna are visible on the local boat ride. Dangers and Hazards The many hazards of the Amazonian rainforest are well-publicized, including piranhas, anacondas, caimans, jaguars, pumas, peccaries, electric eels, stingrays, numerous poisonous snakes, insects, scorpions, spiders, plants, and other dangers. However, researchers at the station have interacted closely with the plants and animals of the rainforest for decades with very few negative encounters. One notable exception occurred on April 27, 2000, when Francis J. Bossuyt disappeared while bathing in the lake at night. He has never been found, and presumed dead, perhaps killed by a caiman or anaconda. In the years since, a memorial in his name was established at the station, and more researchers and other visitors have chosen to use buckets or pumped water to bathe instead. The station also implemented a no bathing at night rule to prevent future tragedies.

Sengge ruled the Dzungar state from 1653 until his murder in 1671 by his two older half-brothers Tsetsen Taishi and Tsodba Batur. Sengge is best known for defeating Erincin Lobsang Tayishi, the third Altan Khan, in 1667 and eliminating the Altan Khanate as a potential future threat to the Dzungar Khanate. While being Khong Tayiji of the Oirats, during one of his raids against Kirgizs, Sengge was captured by his enemies and said to have spent two to three years as a war prisoner. Before his death in 1653 Erdeni Batur named his third son Sengge as his successor to the consternation and disbelief of Tseten and Tsobda Batur. Erdeni Batur's decision to name Sengge as the next ruler of the Dzungar Khanate was based on solely on his belief that Sengge was the ablest of his eight sons. For being the ablest Sengge was given the southern half of the Khanate. The northern half would be split among Erdeni Batur's remaining seven sons. The fourth son, Galdan, transferred his rights to Sengge. Sengge's brothers were not content with their small land inheritance and were also jealous that Sengge was Khong Tayiji of the Dzungar Khanate. To gain a larger share for themselves both Tseten and Tsobda Batur made several attempts to assassinate Sengge. Though they did not succeed until 1671, 18 years after Sengge was enthroned, the continuous internecine warfare generated by their jealousy and hatred for their brother resulted in Sengge neglecting the legacy of his father and grandfather Khara Khula in building the Dzungar Khanate into a powerful Central Asian nation-state. Since Sengge was not able to immediately exert control of the northern half of the Dzungar Khanate the commercial trading agreements between Russia and the Dzungar Khanate were no longer honored by the Oirat tribes roaming the northern border. Instead these tribes returned to the traditional nomadic practice of banditry crossing into Russian territory in southern Siberia to raid nearby Russian outposts and steal the items they previously had to acquire by trade. Sengge was powerless to enforce the agreement his father, Erdeni Batur, had signed with Russia years earlier and honored throughout his reign. As a result, Russia was compelled to engage in dialogue with numerous chiefs of small Oirat clans to no avail. Yet Sengge demanded from Russia that it stop claiming tribute from the small Siberian tribes that he deemed to be the vassals of only the Dzungar Khanate. This issue would cause several skirmishes between the Cossacks and the Dzungar forces during Sengge‚Äôs reign and would remain unresolved at the time of his death. References *Bergholz, Fred W.

He played for the Leeds Rhinos, Castleford Tigers, Hull Kingston Rovers and Harlequins RL in the Super League, and for Great Britain at international level. Ward was previously Andrew Henderson's assistant coach at the London Broncos, and had held this position since 2015. Prior to this, he was head coach of the Under-19s. Background Ward was born in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, England. Leeds Rhinos Ward is the son of former Leeds captain and coach David Ward. He was signed for Leeds Rhinos from Dewsbury Moor, and he made his d√©but as a substitute against the Sheffield Eagles in 1999. He was named the Leeds Alliance Player of the Year in 2000, before becoming a regular first team member the following season. Ward first played at international level for the Great Britain Academy before being selected for John Kear's England Under-21 squad for the tour of South Africa at the end of the 2001's Super League VI. England won the first match 112‚Äì6, and the second match 74‚Äì14. In 2002 he was selected in the England 'A' squad to play New Zealand at Griffin Park, losing 12‚Äì34. He then was part of the squad to tour Fiji and Tonga. One of his highlights in 2002 was a drop goal in a victory at the Boulevard on his 21st birthday. Ward emulated his father by playing in the Challenge Cup Final in 2003. In 2004 he made 14 first team starts and 12 substitute appearances, and scored a try in the 46‚Äì28 win over Wakefield. Ward played for the Leeds Rhinos at in their 2004 Super League Grand Final victory over the Bradford Bulls. In 2004 Ward made the transition into the senior Great Britain team making his d√©but as a substitute against New Zealand in the Tri Nations competition. As Super League IX champions, the Rhinos faced 2004 NRL season premiers, the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in the 2005 World Club Challenge. Ward played as a in Leeds' 39‚Äì32 victory. In his final season with Leeds, Ward scored a try in the 2005 Challenge Cup Final against Hull and in the Grand Final qualifying win at St. Helens that took the Rhinos back to Old Trafford for the Grand Final. He played for the Rhinos at in their 2005 Super League Grand Final loss against Bradford Bulls. He left Leeds before the 2006 Super League season to join Castleford. Castleford Tigers At the beginning of the 2006's Super League XI, Ward was released after an unsavoury incident. He joined the Castleford Tigers, who had just been promoted from National League One. Ward adapted well to his new surroundings and one of his highlights that year was a try in the 31‚Äì30 victory over his former employers at the Jungle. However, his efforts were not enough to save Castleford from relegation. Ward in action for Harlequins RL Hull Kingston Rovers For the 2007 season, he like Luke Dyer, a teammate of his at Castleford, moved east to pastures new at Craven Park with Hull Kingston Rovers. So far, Ward has yet to make the impact that he did at both Leeds and Castleford, but his presence presents a danger to any defence in the whole of Super League. Harlequins Rugby League He was released from Hull Kingston Rovers on 17 September 2007. He signed a two-year deal with Harlequins starting from the 2008 season. Coaching career Ward was the head coach of the London Broncos Under-19s for the 2014 and 2015 seasons. He was the assistant coach in 2015 and 2017. He was promoted to head coach from the beginning of the 2018 season. Ward took charge of his first professional game with a 56-12 victory over the Barrow Raiders. Danny then, in his first year of being head coach achieved promotion into the super league. Winning 4-2 against the Toronto Wolfpack in the final million pound game.

The simple face mask (SFM) is a basic disposable mask, made of clear plastic, to provide oxygen therapy for patients who are experiencing conditions such as chest pain (possible heart attacks), dizziness, and minor hemorrhages. This mask is only meant for patients who are able to breathe on their own, but who may require a higher oxygen concentration than the 21% concentration found in ambient air. Patients who are unable to breathe on their own are placed on a medical ventilator instead. The simple face mask can deliver higher flow rates than nasal cannula (6‚Äì10 liters per minute) for an FiO2 of 40‚Äì60% oxygen. Nasal cannula and simple face masks are described as low flow delivery systems. Unlike the non-rebreather and partial rebreather masks, the simple face mask lacks a reservoir bag. It also has holes in the mask instead of the non-rebreather's one-way valves, so ambient air can enter the mask. This feature eliminates the danger of suffocation present if a mask with one-way valves becomes disconnected from oxygen. Therefore, the simple face mask is commonly preferred by basic life support personnel such as firefighters, lifeguards and other non-medical rescue personnel trained in basic first aid. The final oxygen concentration delivered by a simple face mask is dependent upon the amount of room air that mixes with the oxygen the patient breathes. The air mixing is determined by how much air any individual is breathing at the moment, combined with the fit of the mask. Because of the variability in these factors, the final oxygen concentration is somewhat uncontrolled. A venturi device attached to the mask can be used to control to some degree the concentration of oxygen delivered; usually this is used to prevent hypoxia in emphysema patients who have lost the ability to fully inhale. The effectiveness of the therapy can be continuously monitored using a pulse oximeter, though more clinically useful data can be obtained by drawing arterial blood gas.

After the Spanish retook New Granada, he was barred from the country and was exiled in Havana, where he continued his scientific studies and worked as a doctor. He was later pardoned and allowed to come back to Colombia, and was appointed ambassador to France and to the United Kingdom where he died in 1830. Early life Fern√°ndez was born in Cartagena de Indias, Bol√≠var, on February 19, 1789. Son of a wealthy aristocratic family of the New World, his father Pedro Fern√°ndez de Madrid y Rodr√≠guez de Rivas, was born in Guatemala and held important positions in the Viceroyalty of the New Granada as a subdelegate intendant of the Spanish Army. His paternal grandfather, Don Luis Fern√°ndez Madrid was a knight of the Order of Calatrava and a member of the Council to the King of Spain, and in the New World, served as oidor, or head judge, of the audiencias of Guatemala, and Mexico City. His mother was Do√±a Gabriela Fern√°ndez de Castro, daughter of Don Diego Fern√°ndez de Castro' who served as governor, captain general, and president of the Audiencia of Guatemala.Fern√°ndez de Castro, J.A. \\"Un presidente neogranadino desterrado en la isla de Cuba.\\" Revista de la Universidad de la Habana 1942. 40-42 (enero-junio), 7-26. He began his studies in Cartagena de Indias, but his father was named Superintendent of the Royal Spanish Mint, and so the family moved to Santa Fe de Bogot√°, where he continued his studies in the Our Lady of the Rosary University, in Bogot√°. He initially graduated from his studies in humanities and canon law, but he went back to finish his doctorate in Medicine, graduating on February 16, 1809 all before the age of 20.Universidad de La Habana. Archivo Hist√≥rico. Expediente Estado Antiguo, No. 4426 (Dr. Jos√© Fern√°ndez Madrid). Early political life Amidst the revolutionary events of 1810, Fern√°ndez found himself in Cartagena, where he got his first job as Attorney General for the Province of Cartagena, here he was part of the first revolutionary movements of the city when the Province of Cartagena declared their absolute independence on November 11, 1811. He was later named representative to the Congress of the State of Cartagena de Indias. In 1812 Fern√°ndez was commissioned as representative of his province in the Congress of the United Provinces of the New Granada that was convened in Villa de Leyva. He excelled in Congress and was known for his intellect, and speeches, and his literary works gave him great standing image among his colleagues. Triumvirate On October 5, 1814 the Supreme Junta of the United Provinces decided that the best political solution for the country was to name a triumvirate instead of a president to govern the country alone.Osterling, J.P. (1989). Democracy in Colombia: Clientelist Politics and Guerrilla Warfare. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers. [Rutgers University] Congress elected Custodio Garc√≠a Rovira, Manuel Rodriguez Torices, and Manuel Restrepo to preside over the triumvirate, but since all of them were absent, congress named Jos√© Mar√≠a del Castillo y Rada, Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Camacho and Fern√°ndez, as interim presidents of the triumvirate. The Interim Triumvirate ruled the country from October 5, 1814. Fern√°ndez presided over the triumvirate until March 28, 1815,Biografia de Jos√© Fern√°ndez Madrid when Custodio Garc√≠a was able to step in power.  Presidency 1816  In 1816, the situation of the country was dire. The Spanish reconquest of the country was rapidly advancing under general Pablo Morillo from the royalist stronghold of Santa Marta. Cartagena de Indias had fallen to the Spaniards in December 1815 and Morillo had moved into the north of the country. Independence was being taken away. Many important figures were abandoning the political scene, no one wanted to be in the way of Morillo. On March 14, 1816, Camilo Torres Tenorio resigned from the presidency. The Congress of the United Provinces of the New Granada asked Fern√°ndez to be the president of the United Provinces, he at first declined, knowing very well that he was not the right man for the job, and that he could not bring about a solution to the invasion, but upon pressure of his peers, he accepted and assumed the presidency.Caballero, Jos√© Mar√≠a, \\"Particularidades de Santafe\\", Un diario de... en la Patria Boba. Biblioteca de Historia Nacional, Bogot√°, Imprenta Nacional, [1816] 1902. On May 6, Santa Fe de Bogot√° was invaded by the royalists, this event marked Spain's reconquest of New Granada. So with only 27 years of age, and no military experience, Fern√°ndez marched with a handful of the remaining soldiers to the south. On June 22, 1816 Fern√°ndez presented his resignation to the presidency in Popay√°n to the Permanent Legislative Commission, who accepted it and named general Custodio Garc√≠a Rovira to the post, Liborio Mej√≠a was named vicepresident, and becoming the acting president because Rovira was not present.  Capture  On June 30, after the defeat of the battle of Cuchilla del Tambo, the last battle of the Reconquista, Fern√°ndez and his wife are captured and taken prisoners in Chaparral while they were in search of the lands of the Andaqu√≠ Indians to seek refuge Then, captured and facing the real threat of facing the Judges of War and Purification, who would have sentenced him to death as was the fate of many very important figures during the Reconquista, he pleaded for forgiveness‚Äîa mistake he would later regret‚Äîand he implored for a meeting with general Morillo. Because of his family's record of service to the king, and his lack of military action, his life was spared and sentenced to exile in Spain along with his wife, Mar√≠a Francisca Dom√≠nguez de la Roche, and his brother, Coronel Francisco Fern√°ndez Madrid. Morillo told him: > Within three days you will leave for the Capital [Madrid]. Go learn loyalty > from your relatives!

It affected his health until his brother Jennariello asked what was wrong with him and finally learned the story. Jennariello set out by ship. He bought a falcon and a splendid horse, and a beggar persuaded him to tell his story. The beggar then begged at a magician's house, and Jennariello saw that the magician's daughter, Liviella, matched his brother's dream exactly. Jennariello dressed as a peddler and showed Liviella hoods, handkerchiefs, and other goods, and persuaded her to come to the ship to see his better wares. Then he sailed off with her. Liviella lamented, but Jennariello told her why, and described his brother to her so vividly that she wanted to see this man. On the voyages, two doves flew up. They talked, and one told the other that the falcon would pick out Milluccio's eyes the first time it saw him, but if Jennariello warned him, or did not bring him the bird, Jennariello would turn to marble; that the horse would break Milluccio's neck the first time he rode it, but if Jennariello warned him, or did not bring him the horse, he would turn to marble; and that a dragon would eat Milluccio and Liviella on their wedding night, but if Jennariello warned him, or did not bring him Liviella, Jennariello would turn to stone. Jennariello brought his brother the horse and the falcon and then instantly killed them. At the wedding night, Jennariello went with a sword and fought the dragon, but when his brother woke, the dragon vanished, and he had Jennariello imprisoned as a traitor that night and sentenced to die the next. Wishing to die known as innocent, he told Milluccio his story, and turned to stone. Liviella had twin sons. One day, while she was gone, an old man asked Milluccio what he would give to restore his brother. Milluccio said his kingdom, and when told life was needed, offered his own; when the old man said his sons' lives were needed, he killed them and put the blood on the statue, which restored them. Liviella returned and was grief- stricken, and went to the window to throw herself out. The old man, her father, stopped her, and told her that he had punished them all for their acts against him, but the punishment had been enough. He restored the babies to life.

Mercadante was national vice president of the PT and secretary of international relations, and member of the National Directorate and the National Executive. He participated in drafting PT government programs and was coordinator of the party's presidential campaigns in 1989 and 2002. He ran for vice-president of the Republic on Lula's ticket in the 1994 elections. In his first race for a seat as a federal deputy in 1990, he was elected with more votes than any other deputy in the Brazilian congress. In the House, he stood out in two important Parliamentary Committees of Inquiry (CPI): the PC Farias and Budget. In 1994, Mercadante waived a probable re-election to his seat in the House of Representatives and ran for vice president under Lula. In 1996 he coordinated the government program of the PT and was a candidate for deputy mayor of S√£o Paulo on Luiza Erundina's ticket. He was a protagonist in the national economic debate, attending lectures and publishing articles proposing an alternative model of development. This period resulted in the launch of the book \\"The Post-Real Brazil\\". In 1998, Mercadante returned to the Chamber of Deputies with the third most votes in the legislative body with 241,559 votes. In his second term, he attended several specialized committees on the economy, finances and the tax system. He chaired the Committee on the Economy, Trade and Industry (1999), was leader of the PT's Bench (2000) and member of committees on Foreign Relations and National Defence and Finance and Taxation (2001). When running for a Senate seat in 2002, Mercadante received the second highest vote in the history of Brazilian elections - 10,497,348, a record only surpassed by Aloysio Nunes, from the PSDB, who won 11,182,669 votes in the 2010 elections. In the Senate, he held the leadership of the government caucus until June 2006. In 2006 he was a candidate for governor of S√£o Paulo by the PT, when he got the most votes within the state party internal elections- 6,771,582 votes. That he published a book: \\"Brazil - First Time\\", an analysis of the Lula government as the first socialist government of Brazil. From 2007 to 2008, he chaired the Economic Affairs Commission (EAC) of the Senate. During the impeachment of Senator Renan Calheiros (PMDB-AL) Mercadante advocated combining all the accusations into a single trial, in open session in the Senate. In his speech, he argued: \\"My vote was not a failure, as some have said. It was a transparent vote, of someone who believes that the correct judgment on the merits of the question can only be made based on the complete judicial process\\". In January 2009, Mercadante was elected leader of the PT caucus in the Senate. On 20 August 2009, he announced his resignation from the leadership position because of the party's decision to support closing the investigation by the Ethics Committee against the President of the Senate, Jos√© Sarney. The next day, however, in a speech in the Senate, after a long night of talks with President Lula, he announced that - against the wishes of his family - he had accepted the request of the president that he continue as the Party's leader in the chamber. In 2010, he ran as PT's candidate for governor of S√£o Paulo: however, he was defeated in the first round by Geraldo Alckmin. Mercadante was invited to join the cabinet of President Dilma Rousseff as Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation in 2011. On 18 January 2012, he was invited to assume the Ministry of Education due to the departure of the prior minister, Fernando Haddad, to run for mayor of S√£o Paulo.

It would be the final member of the azabenzene (azine) series, in which all of the methine groups of the benzene molecule have been replaced with nitrogen atoms. The two last members of this series, hexazine and pentazine, have not been observed, although all other members of the azine series have (such as pyridine, pyrimidine, pyridazine, pyrazine, triazines, and tetrazines). Stability The hexazine molecule bears a structural similarity to the very stable benzene molecule. Like benzene, it has been calculated that hexazine is likely an aromatic molecule. Despite this, it has yet to be synthesized. Additionally, it has been predicted computationally that the hexazine molecule is highly unstable, possibly due to the lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms, which may repel each other electrostatically and/or cause electron-donation to sigma antibonding orbitals.

It is partly migratory, with populations of blue-winged parrots travelling to Tasmania for the summer. The parrot is sexually dimorphic ‚Äì the males have more blue on the wings and a two-toned blue frontal band on the head, while females are duller and have more green on the wings and a wingbar. Both sexes have predominantly olive-green plumage. Predominantly a feeder on the ground, the blue-winged parrot mainly eats seeds of grasses. It adapts readily to captivity. Taxonomy German naturalist Heinrich Kuhl described the blue-winged parrot in 1820 as Psittacus chrysostomus, noting that it had been confused with the turquoise parrot (N. pulchella). However, the material used to describe it contained specimens of both this species and the elegant parrot. The species' name is from the Ancient Greek words khrysos \\"golden\\" and stoma \\"mouth\\", from the yellow skin around the eyes. In 1821, Coenraad Jacob Temminck gave the species the name Psittacus venustus, however Kuhl had used this binomial name for the parrot now known as the northern rosella (Platycercus venustus). Gregory Mathews described two subspecies but neither is recognised as distinct today. Early names included the blue-banded parakeet or blue-banded grass parakeet, taken from the species' blue frontal band. However this plumage is shared by two other members of the genus. It was also known as the Hobart ground parrot in Tasmania from its terrestrial habits. It is also called blue-winged grass parrot or blue winged grass parakeet, as well as its official name of blue- winged parrot. One of six species of grass parrot in the genus Neophema, it is most closely related to the elegant parrot, which is found to the west of this species with some range overlap in South Australia. Description Ranging from 20 to 24 cm long and weighing around 55 g, the parrot is sexually dimorphic ‚Äìboth sexes are predominantly olive-green. The adult male has a two- toned band across the face above but not reaching the eyes‚Äîultramarine above and paler turquoise blue below. Its crown is yellowish, and throat and breast pale green and belly yellow, its wing coverts and under wing coverts are deep blue. The tail is blue-grey. The bill is blue-grey and the iris is brown. The adult female is duller with dull olive underparts and smaller blue on wings and less distinctive frontal band. Juveniles are dull olive green with slate- blue wings and no frontal band. The greater amount of blue on the wing helps distinguish the Blue-winged parrot from the elegant parrot and the orange- bellied parrot. The latter two species have more yellow-green and bright green plumage overall respectively. Distribution and habitat The blue-winged parrot is found across southeastern Australia. In eastern South Australia, it is found north to the Flinders Ranges, and across Victoria. It is more sporadic across central and western New South Wales and into Queensland, as far north as Diamantina National Park. It lives in savannah woodland, grasslands, orchards, farmlands, marshes, heath, dunes, and other open habitats up to above sea level. It is one of only three species of parrot that make regular yearly migrations over a sea or ocean, with many members of the species flying between Tasmania, where they breed in spring and summer, and the mainland, where they winter. Some birds, however, do remain in Tasmania over the winter and some remain on the mainland to breed in the summer. It is a spring visitor to King Island in the Bass Strait. Feeding Blue-winged parrots mainly feed on the ground, eating seeds of grasses, including wallaby grass (Austrodanthonia), silver hairgrass (Aira caryophyllea), pale sundew (Drosera peltata) in Tasmania, and Poa caespitosa and the introduced capeweed (Arctotheca calendula) on the mainland, and in Queensland tangled lignum (Muehlenbeckia florulenta). They have been seen feeding alongside the European goldfinch in Victoria. Flock size ranges from pairs in breeding season to up to 2,000 birds just before autumn migration. Breeding Breeding takes place from September to January, with one to two broods attempted each season. Blue- winged parrots use hollows of live and dead trees, generally eucalypts, as nesting sites up to 20 m above the ground. The clutch consists of four to six round or oval glossy white eggs, each of which is generally 22 mm long by 19 mm (0.8 by 0.7 in) wide. Incubation takes around 20 days and baby birds spend another 35 days in the nest. Parasite The bird louse Forficuloecus greeni has been recovered from the blue-winged parrot. In captivity The blue- winged parrot adapts readily to cultivation, and can be maintained in a 3 m (10 ft) communal aviary. It has been crossbred with the elegant and turquoise parrots.

Overview The camera's MSRP was USD $3500 when it came out. With three 1/3-inch CCDs, a digital sensor resolution of 410,000 pixels, and an analog horizontal resolution of better than 530 lines, its resolution and video clarity were nearly unsurpassed, even by models far past its price point. It was the first consumer camcorder with the ability to transfer video information via Firewire to an ordinary Windows or Macintosh computer, and also the first to use both the MiniDV tape format and three-CCD color processing technology--boasting twice the horizontal resolution of VHS and triple the color bandwidth of single-CCD cameras. Together with the rival Canon XL1 and shorter-lived \\"budget\\" three-CCD DV models like the Canon GL1 and Sony DCR-TRV900, the VX1000 revolutionized desktop video production in the late 1990s, delivering quality comparable to then-dominant analog Betacam hardware at a fraction of the cost. Even years after being discontinued, the VX1000 enjoyed a devoted secondhand following from skateboarding and BMX action sports filmmakers, thanks to its relative portability, sturdy construction, and fisheye lens attachments. Today the VX1000 is used among cult skateboarding filmmakers and has become one of the strongest symbols of street skateboarding culture since it has featured in iconic videos over two decades. The VX1000 was based on Sony's earlier VX1 (PAL) and VX3 (NTSC) Hi8 camcorders, which were similarly intended as \\"prosumer\\" models, targeted at both high-end consumer and low-end professional users. In the mid-1990s, Sony began to move away from Hi8 tape in favor of the emerging DV format, and as a result the VX3 and VX1 were discontinued in 1995. However, their iconic form factor, with a distinctively- shaped stereo microphone array at the front of the handle, was reused by the VX1000 and numerous later Sony DV and HDV camcorders in the VX, PD, FX and Z lines. At the time, Sony had a pattern of releasing \\"professional\\" upgraded versions of their most popular consumer cameras, with the same chassis shape but made from more durable materials and in a darker color. Extra features included XLR inputs and the ability to record in the higher-grade DVCAM format. The VX1000 however had no professional equivalent apart from the shoulder-mounted VX9000 and DVCAM equivalent DSR200(with \\"A\\" and \\"P\\" variants) - it used the same 3ccd sensor chips and lens, however used fullsize DV tapes compared to miniDV. (its successor, the VX2000 was offered as DSR-PD150, notably used in the production of David Lynch's 2006 feature film Inland Empire, and the VX2100 as DSR-PD170 and later on in slight modification as DSR-PD175).

They are not part of the adaptive immune system, as they have no memory, but otherwise, B1 cells perform many of the same roles as other B cells: making antibodies against antigens and acting as antigen- presenting cells. These B1 cells are commonly found in peripheral sites, but less commonly found in the blood. These cells are involved in antibody response during an infection or vaccination. There are two types of B1 cells subsets, B1a cells and B1b cells. B1b cells have been shown to be capable of memory responses. B1b cells also can recognize protective antigens in bacteria, which is unique because they are targeting something internal.  Origin  B1 cells are first produced in the fetus and most B1 cells undergo self-renewal in the periphery, unlike conventional B cells (B2 cells) that are produced after birth and replaced in the bone marrow.  Types  Human B1 cells have been found to have marker profile of CD20+CD27+CD43+CD70- and could either be CD5+ or CD5-, which has been debated since. CD5-CD72 is thought to mediate B cell-B cell interaction. What differentiates B1 cells from other B cells is the variable existence of CD5, CD86, IgM and IgD. B-1 B cells, in the mouse, can be further subdivided into B-1a (CD5+) and B-1b (CD5‚àí) subtypes. Unlike B1a B cells, the B-1b subtype can be generated from precursors in the adult bone marrow. The B1a and B1b precursors have been reported to differ in the expression levels of CD138. Compared to B1a cells, B1b cells seem to recognize more types of antigens including intracellular antigens. Previously, B1b cell antigen recognition was thought to be random; however, recent research indicated that B1b cells specifically target a variety of protective antigens, also called conserved factors, over other types antigens. Recent functional studies indicate a further subdivision of labor assigning B1a cells as the producers of natural serum antibody (7). In contrast, B1b cells appear to be the primary source of dynamic T cell independent (TI) antibody production and long-term protection after bacterial infection such as Borrelia hermsii and Streptococcus pneumoniae. These studies indicate preexisting subset differences in B-cell receptor (BCR) specificity and antigen-driven B cell fate that remain important unresolved features of the system.  Role in immune response B1b cells are the most common B cells involved in antibody response during an infection or vaccination. This is because they can respond without receiving an activation signal from a T Helper cell. B1 cells express IgM in greater quantities than IgG and its receptors show polyspecificity, meaning that they have low affinities for many different antigens. These polyspecific immunoglobulins often have a preference for other immunoglobulins, self antigens and common bacterial polysaccharides. B1 cells are present in low numbers in the lymph nodes and spleen and are instead found predominantly in the peritoneal and pleural cavities. B1 cells generate diversity mainly via recombinatorial recombination (there is a preferential recombination between D-proximal VH gene segments). B1 B cells characteristically express high levels of surface IgM (sIgM), demonstrable CD11b, and low levels of surface IgD (sIgD), CD21, CD23, and the B cell isoform of CD45R (B220). In adult mice, B1 B cells constitute a minor fraction of the spleen and secondary lymphoid tissues but are enriched in the pleural and peritoneal cavities., B1 B cells were shown to arise from precursors in the fetal liver and neonatal but not adult bone marrow and constitute the earliest wave of mature peripheral B cells. B1 B cells express a separable BCR repertoire. Sequence analysis indicates antibodies with restricted sets of V region genes and an increased usage of Œª light chains. B1 B cells sequences also show no evidence for somatic hypermutation (SHM), and few non-templated nucleotide (N) sequence insertions, a pattern typical of neonatal B cells. Efficient B1 B cell development appears to be dependent on positive regulators of BCR signaling and the loss of negative regulators promotes greater accumulation of B1 B cells. Hence, there appears to be a role for self or foreign antigen in shaping the repertoire of the B-1 B cell compartment. B1 B cells self-renew and spontaneously secrete IgM and IgG3 serum antibodies. These natural serum antibodies display extensive polyreactivity, demonstrable self-reactivity and bind to many common pathogen-associated carbohydrates. Natural serum antibodies play an important early role in the immune response to many bacteria and viruses but require complement fixation for effective antigen clearance. Innate sensing mechanisms can rapidly mobilize B1 B cells regardless of specificity, highlighting the innate-like activity of this separate B cell compartment. B1b cells are known to be able to induce some type of memory, but their role in memory cells is unknown and may follow an untraditional route. B1b cells have effective and long-lasting responses to Borrelia hermsii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella Enterica, Salmonella Typhi and Enterobacter cloacae bacteria.  Laboratory isolation  In research laboratories, B1 B cells can be easily isolated from a mouse by injecting cell medium or PBS into the peritoneal cavity of the mouse and then draining it off via a technique mirroring diagnostic peritoneal lavage. Cells can be identified and placed into two categories \\"B1a\\" or B1b\\" using flow cytometry looking for surface expression of CD19, B220, and CD5. B1a expresses high CD5 level, while B1b expresses low CD5 to almost-absent levels; both are CD19+ and B220low/-.

Commonly referred to as LiTEBH or Superhydride, it is a powerful reducing agent used in organometallic and organic chemistry. It is a colorless or white liquid but is typically marketed and used as a THF solution.Marek Zaidlewicz, Herbert C. Brown \\"Lithium Triethylborohydride\\" Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis 2001, John Wiley & Sons. The related reducing agent sodium triethylborohydride is commercially available as toluene solutions. LiBHEt3 is a stronger reducing agent than lithium borohydride and lithium aluminium hydride. Preparation LiBHEt3 is prepared by the reaction of lithium hydride (LiH) and triethylborane (Et3B) in tetrahydrofuran (THF): :LiH + Et3B ‚Üí LiEt3BH Its THF solutions are stable indefinitely in the absence of moisture and air. Reactions Alkyl halides are reduced to the alkanes by LiBHEt3.Brown, H.C.; Kim, S.C.; Krishnamurthy, S. \\"Selective reductions. 27. Reaction of alkyl halides with representative complex metal hydrides and metal hydrides. Comparison of various hydride reducing agents\\" J. Org. Chem. 1980, 45, 1-12. LiBHEt3 reduces a wide range of functional groups, but so do many other hydride reagents. Instead, LiBHEt3 is reserved for difficult substrates, such as sterically hindered carbonyls, as illustrated by reduction of 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-3-pentanone. Otherwise, it reduces acid anhydrides to alcohols and the carboxylic acid, not to the diol. Similarly lactones reduce to diols. Œ±,Œ≤-Enones undergo 1,4-addition to give lithium enolates. Disulfides reduce to thiols (via thiolates). LiBHEt3 deprotonates carboxylic acids, but does not reduce the resulting lithium carboxylates. For similar reasons, epoxides undergo ring-opening upon treatment with LiBHEt3 to give the alcohol. With unsymmetrical epoxides, the reaction can proceed with high regio- and stereo- selectivity, favoring attack at the least hindered position:[2] :Image:Reduction of epoxide.png Acetals and ketals are not reduced by LiBHEt3. It can be used in the reductive cleavage of mesylates and tosylates.Baer, H.H.; Mekarska-Falicki, M. Can. J. Chem. 1985, 63, 3043. LiBHEt3 can selectively deprotect tertiary N-acyl groups without affecting secondary amide functionality.Tanaka, H.; Ogasawara, K. Tetrahedron Lett. 2002, 43, 4417. It has also shown to reduce aromatic esters to the corresponding alcohols as shown in eq 6 and 7. :Image:Ester to alcohol.png LiBHEt3 also reduces pyridine and isoquinolines to piperidines and tetrahydroisoquinolines respectively.Blough, B.E.; Carroll, F.

The character was portrayed by Kathryn Hays continuously from 1972. Kim was created by soap opera legend Irna Phillips and was based on Irna's own personality. She soon became one of As the World Turnss most popular characters. First appearing in August 1972, the actress become the fourth longest serving cast member on the show after Helen Wagner (Nancy Hughes), Don Hastings (Bob Hughes), and Eileen Fulton (Lisa Grimaldi) when the show finished on air on September 17, 2010. Kim's storylines often revolve around the core Hughes family. The character is portrayed as strong, fiery, sensitive and mother figure who in recent years has taken on the role as the Hughes' matriarch. Throughout her almost 40-year run on the show, Kim has endured several love interests, health issues including open heart surgery and amnesia whilst making the change from adulterous home-wrecker to matriarchal figure. Princeton's Bureau County Republican said the character had \\"grown over the decades and survived the typical drama of complicated soap plots.\\" Creation and casting=Characterisation Kathryn Hays was cast as the single, marriage-wrecking Kim Sullivan in 1972 by Irna Phillips. Various accounts have suggested that Kim is, in some ways, representative of Phillips herself. Phillips had written an earlier story on Another World for the character Pat Randolph that had also paralleled her own life. \\"I don't know if she modelled Kim after herself,\\" Hays said in an interview. \\"Don [Hastings] once said to me that Irna Philips saw something in me, or something that spoke to her in some ways. I don‚Äôt really know...I was really terrified of her to tell you the truth.\\" \\"Kim was written as a troublemaker. She was going to come in and cause trouble for Dr. Bob and Jennifer, Kim‚Äôs sister. Irna turned that into someone who had depth and evolved into Kim. For me as an actor, it started one way and then turned into someone else.\\" \\"She turned into a deeper character, and that was wonderful. I was playing a character who had had a rough patch in her life but she made the choice to be a better person and to not be selfish. She made the choice to be thoughtful of others. You saw her grow through those years.\\" Hays said it was always reassuring to know that if Kim got pushed too far, or too hard, \\"she could turn around and deck you. Verbally, not physically.\\" Character development and impact=Early storylines Kim evolved from an adulterous sister to a loving member of the Oakdale community. She first arrived in Oakdale for her sister Jennifer's wedding to Bob Hughes in late 1972, she fell in love with Bob as he also began to share feelings for Kim. Bob and Jennifer's marriage was at a strain due to the behavior of Jennifer's son Rick, Bob took a break to Florida and Kim who still had feelings for Bob followed him there and pretended that she had met him out of pure coincidence. Eventually Kim and Bob shared a one-night stand together and then the two returned to Oakdale where Jennifer announced she was pregnant with Bob's child. However Kim was also pregnant with Bob's child but she didn't want to hurt Jennifer so she married Bob's rival Dr. John Dixon. At this stage, show creator Irna Phillips planned to have Bob leave Jennifer for Kim, this caused outrage among viewers who thought Kim should've been \\"punished\\" for her adultery. CBS asked Irna to reconsider but Irna refused, they were forced to dismiss her as head writer. At that time, the story had Kim gave birth to a stillborn baby. Marital rape Kim never really loved John as she was really in love with Bob. In frustration with their lackluster marriage, John raped Kim and marital rape was not illegal in those days so Kim couldn't press charges against him. Kim stayed in her marriage to keep her sister Jennifer happy. \\"It didn‚Äôt register with me how important this story was. I thought that relationship certainly served us well throughout the years. It was such a love-hate relationship. That only happened because of what we made out of it. It was so much about how Larry [Bryggman] would approach the scene. Because they would write some brutal things for him. He would then take them and pull it around in such a way that it would be so poignant, so that the reaction could only be one of compassion. That became the way we would function. At the end of one of these scenes, he said to Kim, ‚ÄúIf you would be nicer to me, I will be nicer to you.‚Äù That was in a scene that was written as nasty. Instead of being nasty and brutal, he would temper it. He said that to me in a way that broke my heart. That is what made it interesting. In his terrible clumsy way he really loved Kim. He just wasn't good at being loving. Jennifer's death Jennifer and Bob were happy until Jennifer discovered that she was dying of a rare disease of the central nervous system. Later it went into remission, but tragedy struck for Kim in 1975 when Jennifer died in a car accident. One day she had enough of John's controlling antics and ran out of the house. John followed but fell down the stairs. Kim then stayed with John out of guilt but she had started to fall in love with Dr. Dan Stewart. John faked his illness when he recovered and this forced Kim to leave him. Kim fled to a cabin and while writing a love letter to Dan a tornado struck and she sustained an injury that made her get amnesia. John then pretended to Kim that he had the perfect marriage with her. John made her contact with the outside world limited, thinking that her memory would return. When Kim did regain her memory she discovered she was pregnant with John's baby as he had taken advantage of her memory loss. Kim then left John to be with Dr. Dan Stewart. Dr. Dan Stewart and Nick Andropolous Kim got together with Dan Stewart with resistance from his estranged wife Susan and married, in 1976, Kim gave birth to Andy Dixon and in 1978 married Dan. Tragedy struck in nearly 1979 for Kim when Dan was experiencing bad headaches and was diagnosed with a brain tumor. When Dan's illness grew worse, they went on vacation but were stumbled upon by criminals Roy Barker and Chip Kelley who were robbing a store. The latter of the two was killed and Barker held them hostage, Dan disarmed him eventually and he was arrested, sadly the next day for Kim was even worse when Dan died. Kim found comfort in Oakdale's newest business man, Nick Andropolous who was running a Greek restaurant in Oakdale. Kim reminded Nick of his dead wife, this was confirmed when his brother Steve arrived in town, he was shocked when he saw Kim who resembled his brother's dead wife. Kim and Nick then planned to get married but a problem arose, Nick's dead wife Andrea wasn't dead, Andrea eventually allowed a divorce and Kim and Nick married. Kim's stepdaughter by Dan, Betsy was now seeing Steve who was a bad egg and was now involved in smuggling drugs. Betsy and Steve refused to see reason and ran away, Nick found them and threatened to kill Steve in furious anger, Nick made Betsy swear not to see Steve again which she did, then Nick sadly collapsed and died of a heart attack, leaving Kim a widow by three men, Jason Reynolds, Dan, and Nick. Marriage to Bob, Frannie and Sabrina, and Bob's affair with Susan Kim married Bob Hughes in 1985. Shortly after their wedding, she and Frannie were involved in a mystery which eventually revealed Douglas Cummings as Kim's admirer. Douglas kidnapped Kim and Frannie, and was ultimately murdered. Kim believed Frannie may have been responsible, and claimed she did it to protect Frannie (ultimately, Marsha Talbot was revealed as the killer). In 1986, Kim birth to her and Bob's son, Christopher. Not long after, they heard from Frannie, who had seen a woman in the UK that looked like her. Kim, Bob and Frannie eventually learned that the woman, Sabrina Fullerton, was Bob and Kim's daughter. John Dixon and Memorial hospital staff had a role in taking Sabrina away as an infant and getting her out of the country. Sabrina tried to become part of the Hughes family, but stirred up conflict and came between Frannie and her then-boyfriend, Seth Snyder. A few years later, Bob and Kim drifted apart. Bob was feeling left out as Kim and John tried to deal with their son Andy's alcoholism. The strain led to Bob having an affair with an old friend and coworker (and Kim's rival) Dr. Susan Stewart. Though Kim threw him out of the house, she eventually forgave him and their marriage remained on solid ground. Hospitilzations In 1997, Kim underwent a life-threatening heart valve replacement surgery, something sure to alter her and Bob's life for years. During this time she had an out of body experience where she would see her life if she had died on the operating table. In addition, Kim was injured in a church bombing and was in a coma for a time. She recovered with a new appreciation for her family and friends and a new commitment to make a difference in their lives. On this note, Kim donated her bone marrow to Hope Snyder. Kim was later shocked to learn that Hope was her very own granddaughter. Chris' return Chris, now a young doctor, fell in love with the teenaged Alison Stewart, Susan's youngest daughter. Kim didn't seem to have a problem with the relationship until the couple decided to move in together‚Äîinto the Hughes' home. However the relationship didn't workout, and after divorcing, Chris left Oakdale. Hays said during this storyline came one of her favourite scenes with actress Marie Masters (Susan Stewart). \\"When Chris married Alison. Marie and I had a scene where I went to her house, we were talking about our kids Chris and Ally. Kim was trying to make peace, trying to be reasonable, and Susan was having none of it. We got down to the floor and were getting ready to tape. In rehearsal, Marie had added a line at the end, ‚ÄúBe sure to say hello to Bob for me.‚Äù It was a real dig at Kim. At the end of rehearsal it made me so mad, as Kim. I knew what I felt like doing, and I didn't do it at rehearsal. But I knew that if she said that during the taping that I would was going to let it fly. So we‚Äôre taping this thing, it had gone well. Kim was going to the door, and Susan said, ‚ÄúBe sure to hello to Bob for me.‚Äù I yelled, ‚ÄúOh go to hell!‚Äù and slammed the door.\\" Bob's stroke A few years later, Kim was elated when Chris returned. However, she had concerns that he was back with Emily Stewart. However, Emily would be the least of Kim‚Äôs worries. Upon arriving in town, Chris was at loggerheads with Bob over a research project conducted by Evan Walsh IV. While Chris felt the project was cutting-edge and would help people in the end, Bob felt it was far too risky. Though Bob had intended to groom Chris to eventually take over as Chief of Staff, Chris‚Äôs arrogant ambitiousness unsettled Bob. Later, Bob was unexpectedly struck down by a stroke. At Kim‚Äôs insistence, Chris was sworn in as interim Chief of Staff despite his lack of experience. Though Dusty Donovan accused Chris of causing Bob‚Äôs stroke, Chris was exonerated, and humbled, when the true culprit turned out to be Evan. In the meantime, after six weeks, Bob finally woke up from his coma and made a full recovery. Later years and Bob's retirement Despite his brush with death, Bob continued to work long hours at the hospital, frustrating Kim. The final straw came when Bob refused to take a vacation and go away with Kim to the cabin for their anniversary. At the same time, while planning a special surprise for Bob and Kim, Tom and Margo discovered that Bob and Kim weren't legally married. The family proposed holding a quickie ceremony the following day, but an upset Kim revealed that she might not want to marry Bob at all. Luckily, the family was able to convince the pair to reconcile and Bob and Kim married again in a beautiful ceremony with their family present. Months later, Bob finally took Kim‚Äôs wishes to heart and retired in the final episode of As The World Turns. Hays said news of the cancellation of the show come as a shock to her. \\"It was the moment I realized that Kim wouldn‚Äôt be there anymore [tearful]. It was such a shock to me. It was just a shock to me.\\" On filming her final episode in 2010, Hays said the last day was incredibly \\"poignant\\". ‚ÄúThe last day was poignant, and what was so incredible about it was how we shot pretty much in order that day. As each group finished with a scene, that would be the end of their involvement. But it wasn‚Äôt like tomorrow was another show, so the studio got really full. By the time they got to our scenes with Don and myself, there was hardly any room for cameras or the boom. In a way, it felt like being in a theater. We don‚Äôt normally have an audience. The stage manager asked if it was going to be a problem for us, but we both said no. It was like everybody‚Äôs arm was around us. It was absolutely incredible, there was not a sound. It was like everyone was holding their breath. In a way, we were all doing it together. When we finished, Don and I both spoke a little bit to everybody, and the whole As the World Turns family moved to the other end of big studio where they had the world‚Äôs longest table set up, covered with champagne glasses.\\" References Category:As the World Turns characters Category:Fictional television personalities Category:Television characters introduced in 1972 Category:Fictional business executives Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional singers Category:Fictional businesspeople ","title":"Kim Sullivan Hughes"},{"id":"10847138","text":"The Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force (, ML-KNIL) was the air arm of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) from 1939 until 1950. It was an entirely separate organisation from the Royal Netherlands Air Force. The unit was founded in 1915 as the \\"Test Flight Service\\" (Proefvliegafdeling-KNIL, PVA-KNIL). In 1921 it became the \\"Aviation Service\\" (Luchtvaartafdeling-KNIL, LA-KNIL), before finally receiving the designation of ML-KNIL on 30 March 1939. In 1950, following Dutch recognition of Indonesian independence, its bases and facilities were handed over to the Indonesian Air Force (TNI-AU). World War II Air Vice- Marshal Conway Pulford greeting pilots of the ML-KNIL in Singapore, January 1942. On 1 January 1942 the Dutch forces joined the American-British-Dutch- Australian Command, but at the onset of the Japanese assault the ML-KNIL was not up to full combat strength. Of the aircraft that had been ordered, only a small number had been delivered, and many were obsolete models. There were five groups, three of bombers and two of fighters, each of three to four squadrons. A sixth depot group provided support, transport and training. Reconnaissance aircraft were placed directly under command of the Army to give support to ground troops. Despite stubborn resistance the Japanese occupied the Dutch colonies, though numbers of aircraft found their way to northern Australia to continue the fight. Four Dutch squadrons were formed in Australia. The first of these, No. 18 (NEI) Squadron RAAF, was formed in April 1942 as a medium bomber squadron equipped with B-25 Mitchell aircraft. The second joint Australian-NEI squadron, No. 119 (NEI) Squadron RAAF, was also to be a medium bomber squadron. No. 119 NEI Squadron was only active between September and December 1943 when it was disbanded to form No. 120 (NEI) Squadron RAAF, was a fighter squadron. In 1944, the KNIL formed No. 1 Netherlands East Indies Transport Squadron, later absorbed by the RAAF as No. 19 (NEI) Squadron RAAF. Both No. 18 and No. 120 Squadrons saw action against the Japanese during World War II. From late 1945, Nos 18, 19 and 120 squadrons fought against Indonesian nationalists, during the Indonesian National Revolution. The squadrons were disbanded in 1950.

It was changed to United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala when peacekeepers were deployed. The aim of the operation was to conclude the 36-year Civil War which had ravaged the country. It was the international community's response to the decision by both government and guerrillas to return to the negotiating table in 1994 and the subsequent signing of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights on 29 March 1994, one of several documents adopted in the run-up to the final peace agreement. In 1994, the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) agreed to resume negotiations to end the longest conflict in Latin America. In September 1994, the General Assembly decided to establish a Human Rights Verification Mission in Guatemala acting on a recommendation by the Secretary-General that such a mission could make a contribution to a persisting pattern of human rights abuse. A series of agreements had earlier been concluded covering a wide range of problems in Guatemalan society: *Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights (March 1994) *Agreement on a Timetable for the Negotiation of a Firm and Lasting Peace (March 1994) *Agreement on Resettlement of the Population Groups Uprooted by the Armed Conflict (June 1994) *Agreement on the Establishment of the Commission to Clarify Past Human Rights Violations and Acts of Violence (June 1994) Since November 1994, MINUGUA carried out verification activities and institution-building throughout the country. More than 250 human rights monitors, legal experts, indigenous specialists and police were posted throughout Guatemala, including in its remotest areas. Their presence and verification activities have focused public attention on human rights and the related problem of impunity, reinforcing the declining trend in political violence. In 1996, measures aimed at democratic change were consolidated. They included a broad appeal for participation in presidential elections and the unilateral cessation of hostilities by the URNG during the two rounds of elections, the URNG's offer to cease offensive military action in March, followed by a similar commitment from the Government. The year 1996 also saw the conclusion of agreements on Social and Economic Aspects and Agrarian Situation (May 1996) and the Strengthening of Civilian Power and the Role of the Army (September 1996). An earlier agreement covered the identity and rights of indigenous persons (March 1995). In December 1996, the Guatemalan Government and the URNG reached an agreement on the details of a cease-fire, on constitutional and electoral reforms, and the reintegration of the URNG into Guatemala's political life, which was followed by a final peace accord, the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace, signed on 29 December 1996. MINUGUA had already been involved in verification of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights and the human rights aspects of the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Upon conclusion of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace, all other agreements entered into force. By adopting resolution 1094 (1997) on efforts towards peace in Central America, the Security Council authorized on 20 January 1997 the attachment of a group of 155 military observers and requisite medical personnel to MINUGUA for a three-month period, operational as of 3 March 1997. The task of the observer group were verification of the agreement on the definitive ceasefire. While retaining its acronym MINUGUA, the peacekeeping mission's name was changed to United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala as of 1 April 1997 in order to reflect the new mandate. In a Presidential Statement of 5 March 1997 (S/PRST/1997/9), the Council welcomed the deployment on 3 March 1997 of the group of United Nations military observers attached to the United Nations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights and of Compliance with the Commitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in Guatemala (MINUGUA) for the purposes of verification of the Oslo ceasefire agreement and reaffirmed its full support for the peace process in Guatemala. The Secretary-General reported to the Security Council on 4 June 1997 on the group of military observers attached to MINUGUA (S/1997/432), stating that of the 155 authorized personnel, 132 military observers from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ecuador, Norway, the Russian Federation, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, the United States of America, Uruguay and Venezuela were deployed to the Mission area. In addition, 13 medical personnel from Austria, Germany and Singapore served in the mission. The 1996 Oslo Agreement provided for the formal ceasefire to enter into force as of 00:00 hours on D-day, on which date the United Nations military observer group as the verification authority was ready to assume its responsibilities. On 13 February 1997, the Secretary-General informed the Security Council (S/1997/123) that the operation it had mandated could begin on 3 March 1997, following completion of the preparatory work for the deployment of the group and the establishment of the URNG assembly points. Until then, the parties maintained the informal ceasefire that they had observed since 19 March 1996. On day D-15 (16 February 1997), URNG provided information on 3,570 personnel to be demobilized. It also provided an inventory of the weapons, explosives and mines in its possession and information on the location of remaining minefields. The Guatemalan Army, for its part, provided the requisite list of units that were to be redeployed to their bases. On D-10 (21 February 1997), members of the military observer group were deployed to the six verification centres (Finca Sacol, Finca Claudia, Finca Las Abejas, Tululch√©, Tzalbal and Mayal√°n) responsible for monitoring the eight URNG assembly points. In addition, two sector headquarters and a main headquarters were set up to provide command and control. The separation of forces between the Guatemalan Army and URNG was carried out through the establishment of two concentric areas around each URNG assembly point. Army units were not permitted to enter an inner 6-kilometre-wide \\"security zone\\" and police units could only do so after coordinating their movements with the military observer group. As Army units left the security zones, URNG troops moved to the assembly points according to a plan presented to the military observer group on D+2 (5 March 1997). As envisaged by the Agreement, two United Nations military observers were attached to each of the Guatemalan Army units subject to verification. As former combatants concentrated in the assembly points, their weapons, munitions, explosives, mines and related military equipment were registered and handed over to the United Nations military observers for storage in special containers and explosive dumps. Although demining was not foreseen in the Agreement, URNG helped to identify and clear all its minefields, in particular that located on the Tajumulco Volcan. By 18 April 1997, 378 mines and explosive devices had been lifted and destroyed. 2,928 URNG rebels were demobilized, and a total of 535,102 weapons and rounds of ammunition were handed over to the United Nations military observer group by URNG. On 14 May 1997, URNG weapons, munitions and equipment, as well as the lists of destroyed explosive devices, were delivered to the Ministry of the Interior of Guatemala. The corresponding handover certificate was signed by the Government of Guatemala, and by the UN Chief Military Observer This last act signalled the completion of the mandate of the military observer group. Repatriation of the members of the United Nations military observer group began on 17 May 1997. A rear party remained at headquarters in the capital until 27 May, when the last United Nations military observers departed Guatemala.

Research interests and major contributions  Social theory, anthropological and historical theory, political anthropology, pre-industrial societies, cultures and history of Africa, socio-cultural transformations and intercultural interaction in contemporary world (including ethnic, racial, and religious aspects, migration issues) with special focus on Africa and people of African descent worldwide Bondarenko has introduced (together with Andrey Korotayev) and started elaborating the notion of homoarchy to be coupled with the one of heterarchy, noting that the heterarchy (defined as \\"the relation of elements to one another when they are unranked or when they possess the potential for being ranked in a number of different ways\\") is not the opposite of any hierarchy all together, but is rather the opposite of \\"homoarchy\\", defined as \\"the relation of elements to one another when they are rigidly ranked one way only, and thus possess no (or not more than very limited) potential for being unranked or ranked in another or a number of different ways at least without cardinal reshaping of the whole socio-political order\\". Basing primarily on the precolonial Benin Kingdom evidence, Bondarenko has elaborated the conception of \\"megacommunity\\" as a specific type of the non-state supercomplex society, integration of a supercomplex (exceeding the complex chiefdom level) society on community (and hence non-state) basis being its main distinctive feature. He has contributed to the studies of the state origins and nature by dealing with such aspects of the problematics as the dynamics of kinship and territoriality as principles of socio-political organization, transformations in ideology, and others. In publications on contemporary issues Bondarenko argues, in particular, that globalization should be viewed as a primarily cultural, not economic and political, phenomenon which is by no means a recently appeared one but which embraces essentially the whole human history, and which can turn out a \\"successful historical project\\" in the shape of a \\"federation of local civilizations\\" only.

The basilar pons makes up two thirds of the pons within the brainstem. It has a ridged appearance with a shallow groove at the midline This groove is called the basilar sulcus and is covered by the basilar artery, which feeds into the Circle of Willis and provides blood supply to the brainstem and cerebellum. The basilar pons has this kind of appearance due to the fibers that come out of the pons and enter the cerebellum. This part of the brainstem contains fibers from the corticospinal tract (a descending pathway for neurons to reach other structures in the body), pontine nuclei, and transverse pontine fibers. The corticospinal tract carries neurons from the primary motor cortex in the brain to the spinal cord, aiding in voluntary motor movement of the body. In addition to passing through the basilar pons, corticospinal tract fibers go through other structures of the brainstem, such as the internal capsule and the crus cerebri. An integral part of the basilar pons is the pontine nuclei. The pontine nuclei is responsible for projecting axons that go to the opposite cerebellar hemisphere through the middle cerebellar peduncle. Doing this makes the axons change into the transverse pontine fibers. The fibers of the pontine nuclei are all important to motor function, including fiber bundles such as the corticospinal fibers and corticopontine-pontocerebellar system. Specifically, the basilar pons contains all the corticofugal fibers, which include the corticospinal, corticobulbar (or corticonuclear), and corticopontine fibers. The basal pontine nuclei provides the most information to the cerebellum. These pontine nuclei are integral in helping the basilar pons carry information from the cerebral cortex to the cerebellum. The basilar pons is able to do this via the corticopontine fibers that it receives. Once the information passes from the cerebral cortex to the basilar pons and then finally to the cerebellum, the cerebellum gets information regarding complex cognitive functions. Clinical significance Tissue death (infarction), in this region can impair motor functioning. A lacunar stroke of the base of the pons is known to cause contralateral dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome. The basis pons undergoes demyelination in the condition known as central pontine myelinolysis. This condition is due to the rapid intravenous correction of hyponatremia.

The bridge links Kingston Crescent in St. Vital with the Jubilee/Osborne area, a Winnipeg community across the Red River. The BDI Bridge nickname is derived from the nearby Bridge Drive-In (BDI), a popular ice cream vendor. The BDI itself is so-named because of its proximity to the Elm Park Bridge. It was built in 1912 and it was open to two-way vehicular traffic. The deck of the bridge is only 15 feet wide but even the large cars of the early 1960s passed each other. In 1974, it was closed to vehicular traffic, and is a common bridge for foot traffic to the BDI in summer. History The current Elm Park Bridge was first built as a toll bridge to replace an 1890s pontoon bridge of the same name, that gave pedestrians access to Kingston Row. R. F. McWilliams, owner of Elm Park, had tried on numerous occasions to have the City of Winnipeg pay for the construction of a better bridge across the Red River between Jubilee and St. Vital. A full page ad in the Winnipeg Free Press in May 1912 had a diagram showing the Bridge with the Park Line Loop ending on the Jubilee side of the Red River and advertising \\"Five minute [street]car service to the city\\". The December 1912 RM of St. Vital council meeting had passed a motion saying that they preferred the bridge to be located closer to Pembina Street (now Pembina Hwy.). The City of Winnipeg \\"opened\\" the section of Jubilee so that the streetcar could terminate at the new Elm Park Bridge. The toll was 5 cents for pedestrians, 10 cents for cars, and 25 cents for trucks. A repair project that involved replacing the wood under asphalt closed the Bridge during the summer of 1946. The wood for the project came from the cordite plant in Transcona. Two layers of asphalt were then poured over the wood. The tolls were removed in 1946. In 1974 vehicle traffic was no longer allowed on the bridge. Facing heavy renovation costs for the bridge in the mid-90s, the city investigated the possibility of tearing it down but backed away when told of the $1,000,000 price tag, and thus instead was fixed at the cost of $300,000. On May 24, 2014, a 100th anniversary of the bridge was held. The Park Line streetcar route provided access between Elm Park and downtown Winnipeg via the Elm Park bridge.

As a young adult, he worked for a number of years in the newspaper business, founding his own paper, the Humboldt Leader (probably Humboldt, Nebraska), in 1897. In 1911, he sold the paper in order to join the government Indian Service.

Later he was in charge of the Southern Pueblos in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and finally returned to Arizona. In 1926, he retired from the Indian Service and moved to Long Beach, California where he owned a cigar store. Later he joined family in Las Vegas, Nevada and lived out his remaining years there. He was a prominent civic leader and mayor of Las Vegas, and was instrumental in establishing the first low-income family housing development there, which was renamed Marble Manor in his honor after his death in 1945.

M. Hare. According to the theory, a person's moral decisions should be based on a set of moral rules, except in certain rare situations where it is more appropriate to engage in a 'critical' level of moral reasoning. Consequentialists believe that an action is right if it produces the best possible state of affairs.Beauchamp, Tom L. (1991). Philosophical ethics: an introduction to moral philosophy, (2nd ed.). New York: McGraw Hill, 130. Traditional utilitarianism (act utilitarianism) treats this as a claim that people should try to ensure that their actions maximize overall happiness or pleasure.Mill, John Stuart. (1863). ‚ÄòChapter 1‚Äô. In Utilitarianism. London: Longmans, Green and Company, 130. Two-level utilitarianism is virtually a synthesis of the opposing doctrines of act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism. Act utilitarianism states that in all cases the morally right action is the one which produces the most happiness, whereas rule utilitarianism states that the morally right action is the one that is in accordance with a moral rule whose general observance would create the most happiness. In terms of two-level utilitarianism, act utilitarianism can be likened to the 'critical' level of moral thinking, while rule utilitarianism can be likened to the 'intuitive' level. However, it is important to note that rule utilitarianism as it is traditionally understood only affirms moral intuitions when their general adherence leads to the greatest happiness. Utilitarianism Utilitarianism is a type of consequentialist ethical theory. According to such theories, only the outcome of an action is morally relevant (this contrasts with deontology, according to which moral actions flow from duties or motives). Utilitarianism is a combination of consequentialism and the philosophical position hedonism, which states that pleasure, or happiness, is the only good worth pursuing. Therefore, since only the consequences of an action matter, and only happiness matters, only happiness that is the consequence of an action is morally relevant.Sinnott- Armstrong, Walter. 'Consequentialism', The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2007 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), Accessed 24-7-07, Chapter 1. There are similarities with preference utilitarianism, where utility is defined as individual preference rather than pleasure. The two predecessor theories to two-level utilitarianism, act and rule utilitarianism, were beset by various objections. For example, rule utilitarianism was criticized for implying that in some cases an individual should pursue a course of action that would obviously not maximise utility. Conversely, act utilitarianism was criticized for not allowing for a 'human element' in its calculations, i.e. it is sometimes too difficult (or impossible) for an ordinary person. As a descriptive model of the two levels, Hare posited two extreme cases of people, one of whom would only use critical moral thinking and the other of whom would only use intuitive moral thinking. The former he called the 'archangel' and the latter the 'prole'. It is worth noting that it is not Hare's intention to divide up the entire human race into either archangels or proles; according to his theory each person shares the traits of both to limited and varying extents at different times. The archangel has superhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no weaknesses. This unbiased 'ideal observer', when presented with an unfamiliar situation, would be able to immediately scan all potential consequences of all possible actions in order to frame a universal principle from which he/she could decide an appropriate action for the situation. Such a person would not need a set of intuitive moral rules, as he/she would be able to decide the correct response to any possible situation by reason alone. By contrast, the prole has these human weaknesses to an extreme degree. He/she must rely upon intuitions and sound prima facie principles all of the time, as he is incapable of critical thought. The set of intuitive moral rules that the prole follows must be simple and general enough that they can be easily understood and memorised, and also quick and easy to use. Once one has identified the different types of moral thinking, the next step is to identify when one ought to think like an archangel, and when like a prole. Hare identifies three types of situation where critical thinking is necessary. The first is when the intuitive general principles conflict in particular cases. The second is when, \\"though there is no conflict between principles, there is something highly unusual about the case which prompts the question whether the general principles are really fitted to deal with it.\\" Thirdly, and most importantly, critical thinking is necessary in order to select the intuitive prima facie principles that will be used. Criticisms Apart from the criticisms that are commonly made of utilitarianism in general, there are several criticisms made specifically against two-level utilitarianism. One objection is that two-level utilitarianism undermines an agent's commitment to act in accordance with his or her moral principles. For example, a theist will comply with his/her moral code because he/she sees it as based upon God's will. However, a two-level utilitarian knows that his everyday set of moral rules is merely a guideline, and as such any breach of these rules is unlikely to accompany the same degree of guilt as would someone who believed that it was wrong in principle to act in that way. David McNaughton argues that, even if the agent's commitment to his/her principles is not undermined, two-level utilitarianism does not succeed in its goal of showing, \\"how, on utilitarian principles, it is a good idea to think and reason in a pluralist and non-consequentialist manner.\\" It is impossible, he claims, to compartmentalise one's thinking in the way the two-level account requires‚Äîto simultaneously think like a utilitarian and act in a non- utilitarian way. Hare's response to this type of criticism is that he does his own moral thinking in this way, therefore the challenge that this type of moral thinking is impossible must be false. A third variety of objection somewhat related to the problem of 'weakness of will' is that difficulties arise when we try to keep critical thinking separate from intuitive thinking.

His most famous work in the West is The Theology of the Pain of God, which was published in 1946 in Japan and in the United States in 1965. He was a longtime professor at Tokyo Union Theological Seminary. He was, along with K≈çsuke Koyama, a leading contributor to Protestant Christian theology from twentieth century Japan. Life Kitamori was born in Kumamoto in 1916. In high school, he was so impressed by a paper he read about Martin Luther that he made the decision in 1935 to go to Tokyo to attend the Lutheran Theological Seminary there. He graduated in 1938. Having finished his studies at the seminary, he attended Kyoto Imperial University, studying in the literature department under Hajime Tanabe, a disciple of Japanese philosopher Kitar≈ç Nishida. He graduated from the university in 1941, and continued there as an assistant until 1943. In 1943, he moved to the Eastern Japan Theological Seminary, which later became Tokyo Union Theological Seminary. He became a full professor in 1949, and continued to teach systematic (dogmatic) theology there until his retirement from teaching in 1984. He received a Ph.D. in Literature from Kyoto Imperial University in 1962. Kitamori was a major post-war theologian in Japan and this status made him one of the most important players in the re-formation of the Kyodan Church (United Church of Christ in Japan). He served both as a pastor, serving a congregation for forty-six years, and as a churchman, serving in various capacities and helping to draft of the confession of faith of the Kyodan Church. While he is best known for Theology of the Pain of God, Kitamori was a prolific writer in many areas, not only in theology. He published forty-two books and many articles. His theme of the Pain of God remained a central idea in many of these. Theology of the Pain of God has reached a wide audience in Japan, even outside the Christian community. The Pain of God Kitamori's most famous work discusses idea of the pain of God. He bases this idea on Jeremiah 31:20: > \\"Is not Ephraim my dear son, the child in whom I delight? Though I often > speak against him, I still remember him. Therefore my heart yearns for him; > I have great compassion for him,\\" declares the LORD. (NIV) In the Japanese Literary Version (an older translation of the Bible into Japanese), the phrase, \\"My heart yearns...\\" can be translated \\"My heart is pained.\\" Luther matches this idea most closely when he translates it \\"Darum bricht mir mein Herz\\" (Therefore, my heart is broken). While modern Japanese versions were moving away from this translation, Kitamori felt that translators like Luther and Calvin gave him scholarly justification for keeping this translation as the basis of his work. Kitamori linked the Japanese concepts of tsutsumu and tsuraso, natural love and self-sacrificial death, with Christian principles. J√ºrgen Moltmann sees Kitamori's theology useful in explaining how the pain of God helps to heal our pain, because in \\"the suffering of Christ God himself suffers.\\" ReferencesOther sources * Hashimoto, Akio. \\"Legacy of Kitamori in Contemporary Japanese Christian Thought.\\" Missio Apostolica, XII, 1, May 2004, pp. 11‚Äì16. * Meyer, Richard. \\"Toward a Japanese Theology: Kitamori's Theology of the Pain of God.\\" Concordia Theological Monthly, XXXIII, 5, May 1962, pp. 261‚Äì272.

The film is directed by Rick King and the executive producer is Jason Williams.. The production combines narration with reenacted dramatic sequences as its foundation. The film, narrated by actor Edward Herrmann, tells the tale of Union General William Tecumseh Sherman, called \\"Uncle Billy\\" by his troops, and his five-week assault from Atlanta to the Atlantic Ocean (Savannah, Georgia) and then north to trap Confederate States Army General Robert E. Lee. Sherman's military campaign has become the mythic symbol of destruction during the Civil War. The opening sequence poses the question that reflects the film's theme: :Sherman: Terrorist or Savior? Synopsis The documentary chronicles General William Tecumseh Sherman's historic \\"March to the Sea\\" through Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina during the fall of 1864. It shows Sherman marching 62,000 Union troops over 650 miles in less than 100 days, and losing only 600 men along the way. The march introduces a new concept to the already brutal Civil War: total war, where the distinctions between combatants and civilians is blurred. While hated by white Southerners as a destroyer, Sherman is hailed by black Southerners as a liberator. It ends with Union victory and closes with Sherman as an old man living in New York and fondly remembering how his \\"nephews\\" and their \\"uncle Billy\\" would make ten miles a day. The documentary utilizes state of the art production techniques including CGI, special effects and historical re-creations. It relies on historical reenactors to play Sherman's soldiers and all dialogue is in fact quotes from historical sources: letters, Sherman's memoirs, diaries, etc. The documentary features a psychological profile on Sherman, stating that in the months leading up to the Civil War he was accused of being insane and that he contemplated suicide. Bill Oberst, the actor playing Sherman, states in a behind-the-scenes featurette that while the general will always be a controversial figure, he hopes that the documentary will shed light on why the man did what he did. It emphasizes that Sherman was loved by the enslaved blacks whom he freed and that while he did not see himself as fighting to destroy slavery, he nevertheless made a point of treating blacks whom he met with courtesy and respect. (The documentary also shows the reactions of his soldiers as they met blacks along the March. Many had never seen a black person and were surprised to learn that blacks were ordinary people.) The documentary also mentions that Sherman killed far fewer Confederate soldiers and civilians than did Ulysses S. Grant, his friend and fellow general, yet Sherman was the one vilified. The scholars interviewed postulate that the South had need for a scapegoat in the wake of the Civil War and that Sherman was the easiest target. For his part, Sherman is stated to have seen himself as only doing his duty and that he did not care what people said about him one way or the other.

Critical reception The documentary was well received by television critics. Tony Perry of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Civil War documentaries are inevitably judged against the monumental work The Civil War by Ken Burns. Sherman's March, different in tone and approach, more than holds its own. Whereas Burns used period photographs and regional music, Sherman's March leans on reenactments, maps and, like Burns, academic talking heads. If there is a quibble, it's that the music tends to distract, not enhance, the effect.\\"Perry, Tony. The Los Angeles Times, television review, April 21, 2007. Last accessed: April 23, 2007.

They are the largest indigenous group in northern Alberta and are an Algonquian people. Prior to the 18th century, their territory extended west of Hudson Bay, as far north as Churchill. Although in western Northern Saskatchewan and Manitoba, by the 18th century, they acted as middlemen in trade with western tribes. After acquiring guns through trade, they greatly expanded their territory and drove other tribes further west and north.  Culture  Their lodges varied in materials depending upon where they lived. In the southern areas they lived in birch- bark wigwams, and further north, where birch was more stunted, they used coverings of pine boughs and caribou hide over conical structures. There was a clear division of labour among men and women. The men hunted, fished, made canoes, sledges, hunting tools and weapons of war. The women foraged, snared rabbits and other small mammals, tanned hides, cut firewood, made snowshoes, pitched tents, hauled wood, wove fish nets, and made clothing adorned with quill- and bead-work. Coats and blankets were made from woven hare skin or soft caribou fur. In the spring and autumn the Woodland Cree hunted ducks and geese, and ptarmigan in the winter. Like many other tribes that depended upon snowshoe hares for food and clothing, they were affected by the periodic decline in populations, especially in the ninth and tenth years when hares almost altogether disappeared. Winter was a particularly difficult time for the Woodland Cree.  Post-Contact  The Woodland Cree were one of the first Aboriginal nations west of Hudson Bay to trade with European fur traders, as early as the 17th century. They became very closely associated with the fur trade and adapted their clothing and many aspects of their lifestyle and culture to European ways. Considered excellent hunters and trappers, they provided meat and pemmican to the fur trade posts and furs, either directly, or indirectly from trade with other tribes. Marriages or alliances between Cree women and fur traders became an essential link in fur trade negotiations. Because families were on the move most of the time, women in childbirth often had their babies on the trail. The offspring of this alliance formed the basis of a new nation of people, the M√©tis, who adopted the lifestyle of their mother's people or of Europeans and received education in order to become clerks and traders for the North West and Hudson's Bay Companies. By 1800, the Cree were well established in Alberta, from Athabasca-Peace delta in the north, along the Peace River and south as far as the Saskatchewan River. Woodland Cree use legends to convey stories throughout time. Many legends are about aspects of the environment, such as \\"How the raven stole the sun\\" and \\"Deawitchita and the fire rock.\\" It is said that those who tell the legends have the most ikanisha, which means wisdom in woodland cree.

The other four were the Operator, the Skeena, the Distributor and the Omineca. Three of these, the Conveyor, the Operator and the Distributor were built at Victoria, British Columbia in 1908 by Alexander Watson Jr.  Skeena River  The Conveyor began her work on the Skeena River in 1909 under the command of Captain Jack Shannon. She and the other four Foley, Welch and Stewart sternwheelers had their work cut out for them. The construction of the railway from Prince Rupert to Hazelton was one of the most difficult sections of track that would ever be laid in North America. This 186 mile stretch would take nearly four years to build and would employ thousands of workers. At the end of the season of navigation in 1911, the Conveyor and her sister ship Operator were finished on the Skeena, but would continue to work on the Grand Trunk Pacific from the other end of construction on the upper Fraser River.  Fraser River  The Conveyor and the Operator were both taken down to Victoria and dismantled, and their machinery and equipment was put in boxcars and shipped by rail to Jasper, Alberta and then to the end of steel at the eastern end of construction. Because the tracks had not reached the head of navigation yet, the boilers and other equipment had to be hauled by mule wagon the last 25 miles to the shipyard at T√™te Jaune Cache. It was a difficult and dangerous operation, taking a full week, and one construction worker was killed. At T√™te Jaune Cache, the machinery was put into new hulls, and the two new ships were once again named Operator and Conveyor, and both were put back under the command of their old captains. Both were launched on at T√™te Jaune Cache on May 12, 1912. The Conveyor was a large and powerful steamer, capable of carrying 200 passengers, 200 tons of freight, and could also handle a 100-ton barge. In 1912, the Operator and the Conveyor began work on the upper Fraser but were confined to the area around T√™te Jaune Cache as it was a season of very low water and river navigation for these large sternwwheelers was nearly impossible. The Conveyor and the Operator worked regularly during the season of 1913 and then were berthed for the winter at Mile 142 on the downriver side of a new low-level bridge that had just been built, which had cut off navigation for sternwheelers to go further upriver. This bridge had come as an unpleasant surprise to the BC Express Company, which had been promised that the bridges along the upper Fraser would be built with lift-spans to allow sternwheelers access to travel underneath them. However, the low-level bridge made no difference to the two Foley, Welch and Stewart boats, who were finished on this section of the upper Fraser. Conveyor under GTP bridge at Fort George 1914In 1914, their next task would be to work on the construction for the Pacific Great Eastern Railway which was being built from Fort George south. Their new route would take them from Fort George to Soda Creek. The Conveyor and the Operator worked this route from May to August 1914, serving the new work camps and hauling supplies and equipment for rail construction. By 1914, the rivalry between the FW&S; boats and the BC Express boats was quite heated and it soon came down to a race. The Conveyor had proved itself to be swifter than its sister ship Operator, as had the BX proven swifter than the BC Express, so one day in July, Captain Shannon challenged Captain Browne to a race to Quesnel from Soda Creek. The rules were rather odd, as the BX was still obligated to stop and deliver her mail at several different landings whereas the Conveyor had no such obligation and could run right through. As the race progressed, it soon became obvious to all that the BX was the faster boat, as she had stayed ahead for most of the race, despite having to stop several times. At one landing the BX had more mail to deliver than usual and had fallen behind the Conveyor, but she soon caught up and was passing her opponent when Captain Johnson rammed the BX with the Conveyor. Captain Browne immediately pulled over to inspect his boat for damages and the Conveyor pulled ahead again. Browne soon discovered that the Conveyor had hit the BX just where the shear of her guards met and that there was no serious damage. When Browne arrived in Quesnel, he had almost caught up with the Conveyor again. When the full tale was heard by the local populace, it was unanimously agreed that the BX was the winner and she was declared the \\"Speed Queen of the Fraser\\". Captain Shannon, meanwhile was apologetic, and had stated that he just got caught up in the moment. That was the last race on the upper Fraser River, because that August would bring the onset of World War I and the halting of construction of the Pacific Great Eastern. The Conveyor and the Operator both ceased work immediately and were hauled out of the river and left to rot at Foley's Cache at Fort George.

Description  It is an evergreen, climbing shrub with thick, thorny stems and drooping branches that are glabrous or sparsely hairy. The leaves have a 0.3 to 1 centimeter long stem. The leaf blade is ovate to ovate- lanceolate, pointed or briefly pointed, 5 to 13 centimeters long and 3 to 6 centimeters wide, sparsely fluffy hairy on the underside and bald on the top. The leaf-like bracts are purple, oblong or elliptical, pointed, 2.5 to 3.5 inches long and about 2 inches wide. They tower over the flowers. These grow individually in pairs or in groups of three on flower stems about 3.5 millimeters long. The crown tube is greenish, clearly angled, about 2 centimeters long, sparsely downy hairy, ribbed and points away from the flower stalk. The tip is lobed five times and forms a short, spread, white or yellowish hem. The six to eight stamens have 8 to 13 millimeter long stamens. The ovary is about 2 millimeters long, the stylus 1 millimeter and the scar 2.5 millimeters.Andreas B√§rtels: Tropical plants . Ornamental and useful plants. 5th, revised edition. Eugen Ulmer Verlag, Stuttgart 2002, , p. 186 . It usually grows tall, occasionally up to . Tiny white flowers usually appear in clusters surrounded by colorful papery bracts, hence the name paperflower. The leaves are dark green, variable in shape, up to long. The flowers are about 0.4 cm in diameter (the pink petal-like structures are not petals, but bracts.) Cultivation B. glabra is heat and drought tolerant and frost sensitive. It is easily propagated by cuttings. It needs full sunlight, warm weather and well drained soil to flower well. The species is often used in culture, in areas with frost in glass houses, otherwise outdoors. The similar Bougainvillea spectabilis, which differs from Bougainvillea glabra by the velvety-felty underside of the leaves, is also cultivated, but less frequently. Uses Being of medical importance, the infusion of the plant's tender leaves and bracts is used orally to treat gastrointestinal problems (diarrhoea, stomach pain), and respiratory conditions (asthma, bronchitis, catarrh, chest pain, fever, pneumonia, whooping cough).Peter Sch√∂nfelder, Ingrid Sch√∂nfelder: The cosmos-Canary flora.

Indiscriminate arrest of Malays has fuelled distrust and resentment against the Thai authority among the locals.South arrests need justifying. Bangkok Post. 3 August 2007. Thaksin had declared a militant law in southern Thailand. Former Prime Minister Thaksin has been blamed for action that lead to an incident at Tak Bai that led to the death of a number of Malays.Thai Premier Blamed For Muslim Massacre  Singapore  Singapore was once a thriving Malay fishing village prior to British colonisation. According to the Malay Annals, a Sumatran prince called Sang Nila Utama was known to have founded ancient Singapore in 1299. However, the modern city of Singapore stemmed from 1819 when established by Sir Stamford Raffles. Under the British administration, Singapore experienced an influx of immigrants particularly from China and India. Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963, along with the present Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak. Since Singapore's separation from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, it became a sovereign, multi-racial republic of which the Chinese community formed the majority. In the 1970s, Mandarin was promoted over other Chinese dialects.Barr, M. Michael. The Charade of Metritocracy. Far Eastern Economic Review. October 2006. SAP Schools were created to provide Mandarin among the Chinese. The reference to Confucian society by former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew marked a shift in policy of neutral multiculturalism to Chinese-dominated society. Chinese schools began receiving government aids while other schools were neglected. The former Prime Minister had once sparked a debate on the loyalty of the Malays to Singapore. He stated that the Malays might have conflict when it comes to loyalty.A question of loyalty: the Malays in Singapore. Retrieved 4 August 2007.

It was first created in the 1870s during the Black Hills Gold Rush by a French goldsmith named Henri LeBeau, who is said to have dreamed about the design after passing out from thirst and starvation. Black Hills gold jewelry depicts leaves, grape clusters and vines, and is made with alloys of gold with standard yellow gold as well as green and pink gold.Paul Higbee, \\"Making Yellow Magic\\", South Dakota Magazine, November/December 2006. \\"The Legend of Henry LeBeau\\", KOTA (AM), May 29, 2009 (audio). In 1980, the 8th Circuit affirmed an injunction ruling that if a manufacturer was to call its jewelry Black Hills Gold, then it must be made in the Black Hills. The state of South Dakota designated Black Hills gold as the official state jewelry in 1988.S.D. Codified Laws ¬ß1-6-16.2 (accessed 2012-01-13). The designs use grapes, grape leaves and grape stems and are easily recognizable for their distinctive colors. Silver is alloyed with the yellow gold to produce the green hue, and copper is alloyed with the yellow gold to make the red or pink gold. The jewelry was originally made with South Dakota-mined gold but in more recent years, since the closure of the Homestake Mine, the gold is sourced elsewhere.\\"Black Hills Gold and Silver\\" in Dustin D. Floyd, Insiders' Guide to South Dakota's Black Hills and Badlands, (Globe Pequot, 4th ed., 2007), , pp. 132-133. Excerpts available at Google Books.  How it's made  Pure 24 Karat gold bars, and stocks of pure silver and copper are the basic materials. These metals are not required to be mined in the Black Hills. The finished jewelry known as Black Hills Gold must be produced in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The different colors of gold used for leaves and other details are made when the pure 24 Karat yellow gold is alloyed with copper to achieve the traditional 14 karat pink (or red) gold, and the gold is combined with silver to create the 14 karat green gold. The resulting gold bars are then readied for rolling. The alloyed gold bars are rolled by presses to different thicknesses for different types of jewelry. Each part is carefully stamped, one at a time, out of the rolled gold sheets using patterns and dies. The solid gold leaves and other patterns are then ready to be added to a cast jewelry base. The cast pieces are then polished by one of two methods, either traditional hand polishing using a wheel, or a process called \\"tumbling.\\" For tumbling: many castings at one time are placed in a tub or cylinder with different sizes and shapes of metal, rubber or other materials in a liquid solution, then agitated or rotated until they have been polished smooth. These smooth, cast pieces are then ready for the stamped components, like leaves and grapes, to be mounted on them. Some manufacturers, such as Landstroms, use the traditional method to attach the pieces, where the stamped components are individually hand-soldered to the cast gold frame using torches and karat-gold solder. Other factories place the solder and components together on the cast item, leaving several such assemblies in a soldering oven where they are soldered by the heat of the oven. The almost-finished jewelry is cleaned in a mild acid bath, then inspected using high quality standards. A finishing technique known as \\"wriggling\\" textures the leaves, creating a textured or frosty effect. Each leaf vein is then hand-engraved for a brilliant, light- catching finish. Each piece is polished in several different steps to bring out its brilliant luster. If the item has gemstones in its design, it is sent to the stone setting department for mounting. Finally, a careful inspection completes the process.

Invented in 1933 by Orton Englehart, it quickly found widespread use. Though it has in many situations been replaced by gear-driven \\"rotor heads\\", many varieties of impact sprinkler remain in use. Development The original horizontal action impact drive sprinkler was invented by a Glendora, California citrus grower, Orton Englehart in 1933 and patented in 1935. Orton later sold it to Clem and Mary La Fetra who manufactured and marketed it under the brand name Rain Bird.  Design and operation  The sprinkler head pivots on a bearing on top of its threaded attachment nut. The head is driven in a circular motion by the force of the outgoing water, and at least one arm extends from the head. The sprinkler arm is repeatedly pushed back into the water stream by a spring. The arm's striking the water stream scatters the stream and re-orients the flow slightly, enabling a uniform watering area around the sprinkler. Some full- circle impact heads feature a second, short range, opposing \\"spreader\\" nozzle (see image), which fills the close range watering coverage role provided by the rapid \\"return cycle\\" on part-circle heads. By adjusting the position of the limiting collars, water flow can be directed from a full-circle pattern to one of less coverage. The limiting collars are fully adjustable by twisting with fingers to achieve the area of coverage desired. The uninterrupted flow path of impact heads makes them less vulnerable to damage and clogging by dirt and sand in the water. Thus, they are suitable for systems fed by well water. One defining feature of impact heads is they almost always have male pipe threads, as opposed to the female threads found on virtually all other sprinkler types. The sprinkler head was originally manufactured from metal. Since the 1970s, they have also been manufactured from thermoplastics for improved corrosion resistance.  Usage  The impact sprinkler's long spray radius and uniform water distribution re-creates the effect of natural rainfall. The device provides an alternative to another above-ground technique called furrow irrigation, in which trenches are dug between rows of crops and flooded.  Variations  An underground pop-up version of the impact sprinkler was introduced as a way to avoid the problem of having to carefully and time consumingly mow around overground sprinkler heads. When not in operation, these sprinklers disappear out of sight below turf level; however, great care should always be shown when mowing to avoid damage to any sprinkler heads which have failed to recede back into the turf. Although largely replaced by gear-driven \\"rotor heads\\" by the 1990s, impact sprinklers still have many advantages, including uniformity of coverage, sand and grit resistance, and operation at lower water pressures.

Named for the Sphinx (a mythical monster formed by joining the body of a lion and the head of a human), she was the only US Naval vessel to bear the name. Construction Originally authorized as LST-963, the ship was redesignated as a landing craft repair ship (ARL) and named Sphinx on 11 September 1944; laid down 20 October 1944, at Hingham, Massachusetts, by the Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard; and launched on 18 November 1944. She was placed in partial commission for ferrying to her fitting out yard, the Merrill Stevens Drydock, Jacksonville, Florida, 12 December 1944, with Lieutenant Maurice H. Evans, USNR, in command. Decommissioned 8 January 1945, for fitting out, she was recommissioned Sphinx (ARL-24), 10 May 1945, Lieutenant Commander Maurice H. Evans in command. Service history=World War II Sphinx completed fitting out and proceeded to Norfolk, Virginia for sea trials and shakedown in Chesapeake Bay. On 12 June 1945, Sphinx sailed for the west coast; transited the Panama Canal on 23 June; and proceeded via San Diego to San Francisco. She was assigned to the Amphibious Forces, US Pacific Fleet, and ordered to Hawaii. Sphinx arrived in Pearl Harbor, on 31 July, and repaired craft there until 27 August, when she sailed for Adak, Alaska. Before she reached Adak, her sailing orders were modified, routing her to Japan. She arrived at Mutsu Bay, Honsh≈´, on 14 September, and began repairing and refitting minesweepers. Sphinx moved to Yokosuka, on 20 November, and sailed for Saipan, on 3 December 1945. She operated in the central Pacific islands until entering Pearl Harbor, on 9 January 1947, en route to the west coast for decontamination. The ship had participated in \\"Operation Crossroads,\\" the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll, in the Marshall Islands, from early April to 29 August 1946. Sphinx arrived at San Pedro, California, on 22 January, where she was decontaminated and prepared for inactivation. She was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 26 May 1947. Korean War The outbreak of hostilities in Korea created a need for Sphinxs repair facilities in the Far East. She was recommissioned on 3 November 1950. After outfitting and holding shakedown training, she stood out of San Diego, on 17 August 1951, and proceeded via Pearl Harbor to Japan. Sphinx arrived at Yokosuka, on 29 September, and operated from Japanese ports until 7 May 1952. During this time, she repaired and serviced fleet units that were being used in Korea. The ship returned to San Diego, on 4 June 1952, and operated along the California coast until redeployed to the Far East from 3 March to 9 December 1954. Sphinx operated along the west coast during 1955, and on 31 January 1956, was again placed out of commission, in reserve, and berthed at San Diego. Vietnam War In January 1967 orders were issued to reactivate Sphinx for use in Vietnam. She was towed to New Orleans, Louisiana, in February, and on 16 December 1967, placed in commission. The ship sailed for the west coast on 8 January 1968, and arrived at San Diego, on 23 February. On 22 April, Sphinx and sailed for the western Pacific. The ships made port calls at Pearl Harbor, Kusaie, Guam, and Subic Bay. Sphinx sailed independently from there on 6 June, and four days later, arrived at Vung Tau, South Vietnam. Sphinx moved to Dong Tam Base Camp, on 11 June, and was assigned to the Mobile Riverine Force in the Mekong Delta. Her unit was Task Force (TF) 117 composed of 11 shallow-draft ships and over 150 river assault boats. The repair ship was on a non-rotating basis and, during 1969, had very little time underway. She operated in the Tien Giang and Ham Luong rivers, providing service and support for the river boats as they engaged in operations against the Viet Cong. The ship sailed from Vietnam, on 21 June, for a yard period at Sasebo, and returned on 25 August. Upon her return to Vietnam, Sphinx operated along the Vam Co River. In addition to her regular duties, the ship served as the tactical operations center of the Can Giouc Interdiction Unit and also developed helicopter capabilities, handling 50 landings before 31 December 1969. She remained in Vietnam, until 14 December 1970, when she weighed anchor for a yard period at Yokosuka. On the last day of the year, the ship lost power in both main engines and was adrift from Sasebo. On 2 January 1971, took her under tow for Sasebo where she was repaired. Sphinx was back off Vietnam, on 11 March, and remained there until sailing for the west coast several months later. She arrived at Bremerton, Washington, on 2 July, and prepared to rejoin the reserve fleet. On 30 September 1971, Sphinx was placed in reserve, out of commission, and remained berthed at Bremerton, into December 1974. Sphinx was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 16 April 1977. Intelligence-gatherer  Sphinx was reacquired by the Navy in 1985, and recommissioned 26 July 1985, at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, with Commander Paul K. Vosseler in command. From September 1984 to July 1985, the ship went through a $25 million overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to become an intelligence-collection platform. It conducted patrols off the Pacific coast of El Salvador, monitoring the actions of the communist guerrilla forces. The ship was decommissioned for the last time on 16 June 1989, at Norfolk, and laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, James River Group, Lee Hall, Virginia, 15 June 1990. Museum ship Custody of Sphinx was transferred on 2 December 2002, to the Dunkirk Historical Lighthouse and Veterans Park Museum in Dunkirk, New York, for preservation, where she was regarded as the \\"Sole Survivor of All LSTs in The US Mothball Fleet Today.\\" Sphinx at Bay Bridge awaiting scrapping It was reported in May 2007, that Sphinx was being stripped of parts by groups from other historical ships, as the Dunkirk Historical group was unsuccessful in raising adequate funds to tow her to their location. In April 2007, the Maritime Administration (MARAD) retained the title and officially withdrew her from donation. On 24 August, Sphinx was sold for scrapping to North American Recycling, Inc., Sparrows Points, Maryland, as part of a five ship contract worth $2,161,610. The ship was moved to Baltimore, but the scrapper went out of business and Sphinx was abandoned along with another Atlantic Reserve Fleet ship, the former . On 30 November 2007, Sphinx was acquired by Bay Bridge Enterprises, Chesapeake, Virginia, for $695,000, who moved her to their facility for disposal. The vessel arrived at their facility on 1 December 2007. Awards Sphinx received one battle star for Korean service and eight campaign stars for service in Vietnam.

Counties, cities, special districts, joint powers authority, and schools districts in California use these financing districts to pay for public works and some public services.  History  The Community Facilities Act was a law enacted by the California State Legislature in 1982. The name Mello-Roos is derived from its co-authors, Senator Henry J. Mello (D-Watsonville) and Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles). When Proposition 13 passed in California in 1978, it limited the property tax rate and the ability of local governments to increase the assessed value of real property by not more than an annual inflation factor. As a result, the budget for public services and for the construction of public facilities could not continue unabated. New ways to fund local public improvements and services were considered and adopted by the California State Legislature. A Mello-Roos tax is a species of parcel tax that circumvents Proposition 13 (which limits property taxes based on the assessed value of real property) because it is not levied on the assessed value of real property.  Districts and taxes  Current law (California Proposition 218 (1996)) constitutionally requires two-thirds (2/3) voter approval to approve the formation of a Mello-Roos Community Facilities District. In instances where the number of registered voters within a Community Facilities District is very small, the required election is held as a property owner election. Sometimes a real estate developer is the only \\"voter\\" in such property owner elections that approve a Mello-Roos tax. Once approved, a Mello-Roos Community Facilities District is formed. Once formed a special tax (which is different than regular property tax) is imposed on all property within the community facilities district. The Mello-Roos special tax is in addition to the regular ad valorem property tax on the property. The Mello-Roos special tax is based on a formula that is specific to that district, that was approved in proceedings. The formula can be based on a variety of factors but cannot be based on the value of the property. In practice, most Mello-Roos community facilities districts base the special tax on a number of common formulas, such as the square footage of the improvements, or proximity to a specific improvement, or based on the acreage of the lot. This is spelled out in the \\"Rate and Method of Apportionment\\" of the special tax, which is a legal document approved in the proceedings. These districts can be used to pay for ongoing services (such as enhanced landscaping within a community). Or, if approved by voters, the special tax may be used as the security on which to issue land-secured municipal bonds (debt). If debt is approved, the special tax will repay the bond principal and interest each year. Mello-Roos community facilities districts may pay for the following public improvements and services: streets, water, sewage and drainage, electricity, infrastructure, schools, parks and police protection to newly developing areas.  Tax deduction  There is conflicting information on whether Mello-Roos taxes are deductible from federal and state income taxes. In general, only \\"ad valorem\\" property taxes (based on the value of the property) are deductible. Mello-Roos taxes are not ad valorem property taxes, but rather are generally flat parcel taxes. However, the IRS has stated that: > Assessments on real property owners, based other than on the assessed value > of the property, may be deductible if they are levied for the general public > welfare by a proper taxing authority at a like rate on owners of all > properties in the taxing authority's jurisdiction, and if the assessments > are not for local benefits (unless for maintenance or interest charges). California uses the federal standard for deductibility of property taxes on state income tax. In either case, the taxpayer has the burden to establish that the deduction of Mello-Roos taxes falls under these criteria on audit.  New communities  Many communities requiring new schools or other public infrastructure such as public parks and roads impose Mello-Roos taxes as an alternative to (or in addition to) impact fees paid directly by real estate developers. While real property taxes are generally levied as a percentage of the assessed value of the parcel, a Mello-Roos tax is levied independent of assessed property value (a parcel tax), and is not subject to Proposition 13 property tax rate limitations.  Older communities  Many older communities have imposed Mello-Roos taxes on areas that include older homes not previously subject to Mello-Roos taxes. This is done when property tax revenues fall short of what is deemed \\"necessary\\" by the local government, or expenditures increase such as from the increased burden resulting from public employee salaries and benefits (including pensions). Many Community Facilities Districts also renew expiring Mello-Roos taxes and increase existing Mello- Roos taxes. Two-thirds (2/3) voter approval is required under Proposition 218 (1996) to increase or extend a Mello-Roos tax.  Reduction or repeal using Proposition 218  Proposition 218 was an initiative constitutional amendment approved by California voters on November 5, 1996. Called the \\"Right to Vote on Taxes Act,\\"Prop. 218, ¬ß 1. Proposition 218 was a constitutional follow-up to Proposition 13. Proposition 218 includes a provision constitutionally reserving to local voters the right to use the initiative power to reduce or repeal any local tax, assessment, fee or charge, including provision for a significantly reduced petition signature requirement to qualify a measure on the ballot.Cal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 3. A Mello-Roos tax or charge levied to finance a service is generally subject to reduction or repeal using the local initiative power under Proposition 218, including the significantly reduced petition signature requirement thereunder. This provides local voters within a Community Facilities District with a readily available legislative remedy to address issues of inequity associated with the financing of local public services in a community. Examples where the reduction or repeal of a Mello- Roos tax on services may be appropriate include where voters desire to eliminate or reduce a public service currently provided by a local government, where voters believe certain public services currently provided by a local government can be more cost-effectively delivered by the private sector such as by a local property owners association, where voters did not previously vote in a registered voter election on a Mello-Roos tax, and where voters believe they are bearing a disproportionate and/or unfair tax burden compared to others in the community. A Mello-Roos tax or charge levied to repay bonds is a legally more complex situation because federal contract impairment issues may preclude the exercise of the local initiative power under Proposition 218. Advice from legal counsel is generally needed in such situations. A local compensatory initiative under Proposition 218 is an alternative option when contract impairment problems are present.

Chemistry Convolutamine A is the 2,4,6-tribromo-1,7-dimethoxy derivative of DMT, a hallucinogen that occurs naturally in many plants and animals. Convolutamine A is chemically related to 5-bromo-DMT which also occurs in many marine invertebrates. Until the discovery of convolutindole A, the 1-methoxyindole moiety was unknown in the marine world. 1-Methoxyindoles, such as lespedamine, were previously only known to occur in legumes and the Brassicaceae, the plant family that cabbage and mustard belong to. Biological activity This chemical was tested for its ability to kill parasitic nematodes. It was found to be more effective than levamisole, a synthetic drug used to kill parasitic worms and to treat colon cancer. References *Narkowicz, C. K.; Blackman, A. J., (June 2001).

Almost all the great medieval English chronicles were included: most existing editions, published by scholars of the 17th and 18th centuries, were considered to be unsatisfactory. The scope was also extended to include legendary, folklore and hagiographical materials, and archival records and legal tracts. The series was government-funded, and takes its unofficial name from the fact that its volumes were published \\"by the authority of Her Majesty's Treasury, under the direction of the Master of the Rolls\\",This statement, or some close variant, appears on the title pages of all volumes. who was the official custodian of the records of the Court of Chancery and other courts, and nominal head of the Public Record Office. The project The publication of the series was undertaken by the British Government in accordance with a scheme submitted in 1857 by the Master of the Rolls, then Sir John Romilly. A previous undertaking of the same kind, the Monumenta Historica Britannica, had failed after the publication of the first volume (1036 folio pages, London, 1848). The principal editor, Henry Petrie had died, and its form was cumbrous. Representations were made by Joseph Stevenson, and the scheme of 1857 was the direct outcome of this appeal. Alongside Romilly and Stevenson, another key figure in shaping the direction of the project in its early years was Thomas Duffus Hardy, who served as Deputy Keeper of the Public Records from 1861 to 1878.Knowles 1963, pp. 102‚Äì17. The first two volumes were published in February 1858: they were the first volume of Stevenson's own edition of the Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis, a 12th-century chronicle written at Abingdon Abbey (the second and final volume appeared a few months later); and F. C. Hingeston's edition of John Capgrave's fifteenth-century Historia de Illustribus Henricis. Hingeston's work was slapdash, and reviews were unfavourable.Knowles 1963, pp. 112‚Äì4. Prolific and well-regarded editors for the series included William Stubbs (19 volumes), H. R. Luard (17 volumes), and H. T. Riley (15 volumes). Editors were handsomely paid (Stubbs received, over the lifetime of the series, a total of some ¬£6,600; Luard ¬£6,432; and Riley ¬£6,487).Knowles 1963, p. 131. However, although editorial standards were often high, there was little supervision or opportunity for enforcing editorial quality, and little incentive for dilatory editors to bring their work to fruition; and as a result there were also less successful editions. In some quarters the project came to be regarded as providing an easy source of income for relatively little work.Knowles 1963, pp. 119‚Äì27, 131‚Äì33. Standard presentation label, in this case in a volume donated to University College, London, reserving the right of the Stationery Office to reclaim the volume in the event of the library being broken up Although at the beginning of the project Romilly insisted on a print run of 1,500 for each volume, this proved greatly over- optimistic in terms of sales, and 750 became the normal figure. The retail price per volume was initially 8s. 6d., later rising to 10s. Initial sales figures for each volume generally reached something over 200 copies: this left considerable surplus stock, and so in the 1880s William Hardy, as Deputy Keeper, introduced the practice of presenting free copies to reputable public and university libraries, with a label inserted stating that \\"in the event of the Library being broken up\\", the volume should be returned to the Controller of Her Majesty's Stationery Office.Knowles 1963, pp. 129‚Äì30. Funding for the project began to be reduced from the mid-1880s, particularly following the appointment as Deputy Keeper in 1886 of Henry Maxwell Lyte, who was concerned about the scholarly quality and pace of production, the funds being paid to unproductive editors, and who felt that his office's priorities should lie elsewhere.Knowles 1963, pp. 120‚Äì9. Thereafter, although work continued on editions already in progress, few new works were initiated. One of the final works in the series was the 13th-century legal compilation known as the Red Book of the Exchequer, edited by Hubert Hall of the Public Record Office and published in three volumes in 1897. This became the occasion of a virulent and intemperate scholarly feud between Hall and J. H. Round (who had been co- editor, but who withdrew for reasons of ill-health and subsequently fell out with Hall): Round described the eventual edition as \\"so replete with heresy and error as to lead astray for ever all students of its subject\\", and \\"probably the most misleading publication in the whole range of the Rolls series\\".For the full story, see The last volume to be commissioned was the Memoranda de Parliamento (records of the parliament held at Westminster in 1305), edited by F. W. Maitland, which appeared in 1893; while the final volume to reach print was the second part of the Year Book for the 20th year of Edward III (1346‚Äì7), edited by L. O. Pike, which appeared in 1911. Scope Chronicles published in the series included the edition of the Chronica Majora of Matthew Paris by H. R. Luard; the chronicles of Roger of Hoveden, Benedict of Peterborough, Ralph de Diceto, Walter of Coventry, and others, edited by William Stubbs; the works of Giraldus Cambrensis by J. S. Brewer; and the Materials for the History of St Thomas Becket by James Craigie Robertson. However, the scope of the series was not limited to conventional chronicles. It also encompassed materials of a more or less legendary character relating to Ireland and Scotland, such as Whitley Stokes's edition of The Tripartite Life of St. Patrick, and the Icelandic sagas edited by Gu√∞brandur Vigf√∫sson and G.W. Dasent; rhymed chronicles like those of Robert of Gloucester and Robert of Brunne in English, and that of Pierre de Langtoft in French; quasi-philosophical works like those of Roger Bacon and Alexander Neckam, together with folklore materials like the three volumes of Leechdoms, Wortcunning and Starcraft of Anglo-Saxon times. Archival records and legal tracts, such as the Year Books of Edward I and Edward III, the Black Book of the Admiralty, the Red Book of the Exchequer, and Bracton's work De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angli√¶ were also included; as were hagiographical documents, dealing for example with the lives of St Dunstan, St Edward the Confessor, St Hugh of Lincoln, St Thomas Becket, and St Wilfrid and other northern saints. Editorial policy In the series as proposed, \\"preference was to be given in the first instance to such materials as were most scarce and valuable\\", each chronicle was to be edited as if the editor were engaged on an editio princeps, and a brief account was to be provided in a suitable preface of the life and times of the author as well as a description of the manuscripts used.This statement of intent, dated December 1857, is published as a preamble to all volumes. The vast bulk of the texts are in Latin, printed without translation. Scribal abbreviations are silently extended. Texts in Old French, Old English, Irish, Gaelic, Welsh, Old Norse, etc. have a translation annexed. Volumes were published in octavo format.

Numbering of volumes The works published within the series were not sequentially numbered (although the individual parts of multi- volume works were numbered).

It is bordered by Jepara regency and the Java Sea to the north, Kudus and Grobogan regencies to the east, Grobogan and Semarang regencies to the south and Semarang to the west. It was the center of the Demak Sultanate, once a dominant power in the region. Due to its strong relation with the spread of Islam in Java and the Wali Sanga, it is sometimes referred to with the nickname Kota Wali. History=Precolonial period The area was a part of the Majapahit Empire during its zenith around the 14th century. The city itself was founded sometime in the late fifteenth century, possibly by a Chinese whose descendant later became the Sultans of Demak. The first Sultan was known as Raden Patah, who was a vassal of Majapahit until 1478. The city was founded as a seaport, next to the now-nonexistent Muria Palaeostrait separating Java from Muria Island (now Mount Muria), although silting has now entirely turned the waterway into land. The Sultanate expanded in the expense of the declining Majapahit and its fragments, conquering the coastal region of Tuban around 1527 and reaching inland areas as far as Malang by 1546. As the capital, the city became an important center for trade and the spread of Islam across the island, and a base of the semi-apocryphal Wali Sanga. Upon the decline of the Sultanate, the region was conquered in turn by the Pajang and Mataram Sultanates. The seaport began to silt sometime in the 17th century, diminishing the region's importance as a seaport. Semarang Residency in 1889. Demak is the area with the coastline facing northwest towards the Java Sea. Dutch East Indies Era Direct VOC presence in Java started upon their capture of Jayakarta (now Jakarta, then Batavia) on 1619. In the 18th century, a massacre of ethnic Chinese in Batavia triggered a war between VOC and Mataram, resulting in the latter's defeat and cession of the north coast of Java, including Demak, to VOC. Upon the latter's dissolution on late 1799, administration of the area along with the rest of VOC's territory was transferred to the Dutch Government while Mataram was reduced to several fragmented states in the south coast of Java, including Yogyakarta and Surakarta. As part of Dutch East Indies, Demak was organized with nearby Semarang into Residentie Semarang as the Demak Regency and later into Central Java province upon the independence of Indonesia. Economy In 2014, the gross regional domestic product of the regency was Rp 14.078 trillion (US$1.133 billion) or Rp 12.73 million per capita (US$1025), with the agriculture and manufacturing sectors being the largest contributors. Rice is the most important agricultural produce, with 608,532 tons harvested in 2016 from 69,975 hectares of cultivated land. A 300-hectare industrial park is currently under construction, aimed to boost investment in the regency. Administrative divisions The regency is subdivided into 14 kecamatan (subdistrict) and further into 243 desa (village) and 6 kelurahan.

During his club career he played for Shrewsbury Town (1980‚Äì1989), West Bromwich Albion (1989‚Äì1995), Hednesford Town (1996‚Äì1998), and Telford United. He earned five caps for the Northern Ireland national football team from 1986 to 1988, and was included in the 1986 FIFA World Cup team.1986 FIFA World Cup: Northern Ireland Squad FIFA. Retrieved 25 January 2010. Playing career McNally grew up in the Ditherington area of Shrewsbury, and was a pupil at the Harlescott Grange School. He was signed as a professional by his hometown club Shrewsbury Town, on the eve of the 1981/82 season, and immediately established himself as a first team member in arguably one of the best ever Shrewsbury Town sides. McNally was one of the key Shrewsbury players during their spell in the old Second Division, as Shrewsbury established themselves as Second Division regulars during the mid-80s, and made a total of 284 Football League appearances for Shrewsbury, though it was once said he should be sold and someone else just as good should be bought. In July 1989, McNally was sold for ¬£385,000 (following a tribunal) to West Bromwich Albion, following talks with both Stoke City and Sunderland. McNally had a successful stint at West Brom, in only his first year at the club he was voted Supporter's Player of the season in 1989/90. Arguably the highlight of his time at The Hawthorns being a member of the squad that won the 1993 Second Division playoffs. He was unable to command a regular first team place later in his West Brom career, and so made a switch to another West Midlands team, Hednesford Town, in 1996. Hednesford were enjoying a successful spell in the Football Conference, and the experienced Football League veteran was a hit with the Hednesford fans. Arguably the highlight of McNally's Hednesford career was the team's 1996/97 FA Cup run, in which the team reached the fourth round, facing Middlesbrough F.C. at the Riverside Stadium. After taking an early lead in front of a 28,000 crowd, Hednesford were unlucky to lose 3‚Äì2, with McNally playing an important role. After playing for Hednesford, he played briefly at Telford United before retiring as a player Managerial career In 2004, one of McNally's former clubs Telford United, went bust following the demise of chairman Andy Shaw's business empire. Despite being unable to save the club, Telford supporters founded a new club, AFC Telford United, playing in the Northern Premier League's First Division. McNally was appointed as the club's first manager, and quickly built up a squad. Despite some early indifferent form, McNally's side soon rose up the table, eventually finishing third in the league and qualifying for the play-offs. Telford were to beat Kendal Town 2‚Äì1 in the playoff final, in front of a league record crowd of 4.215 at the New Bucks Head. Telford struggled in their opening season in the Northern Premier League. With the club second from bottom midway through the season, and following considerable pressure from fans, McNally was sacked, later to be replaced by Willenhall's Rob Smith. Despite the setback, McNally stated in a later radio interview for BBC Radio Shropshire that whilst disappointed, he had no hard feelings towards the club, and was proud to have managed them. McNally is currently involved in football coaching, and is still remembered with great affection by fans at Shrewsbury Town. To that effect he was invited to be part of the Shrewsbury Town 'Legends' who paraded the pitch at Gay Meadow prior to the ground's final League fixture against Grimsby Town on 5 May 2007. McNally was appointed by Indian club, Pune FC as head coach in February 2008, a post he held until May 2008. In September 2009 he was appointed as Caretaker Manager of Southern League Premier Division side Hednesford Town. The club had struggled in the first half of their season under former first team manager Simon Lines, therefore McNally had to work quickly to get the club back on track. Success saw the club finish 4th earning a playoff position. Hednesford Town lost in the play-off semi-finals to Chippenham Town. He was manager until September 2010. In June 2011 he was appointed as manager by Welsh Premier League club Newtown In 2011/12 Newtown went to the league cup final, but lost the match on penalties. The 2012/13 season was mixed for McNally and Newtown, as they kept their league status for another season. That season Newtown beat Bangor City at home and beat The New Saints at Park Hall for the first time in 11 years. In the season of 2013/14, McNally saw his Newtown team play some great football, but it was announced that he was to leave the club to take a coaching roll at former club Shrewsbury Town F.C. McNally's final match was a 2‚Äì0 win against Port Talbot Town, which left Newtown in 5th place in the early season table. Bernie was given a very good send off from the club as the fans and staff were all grateful of the work he had done with a very small budget. On 6 September 2015, it was announced that McNally would take over the managerial position at Hednesford Town FC.

History=Foley Shield Days In North Queensland fierce rivalry between clubs and towns quickly became a feature of the game. To play for your town, North Queensland, Queensland Country, Queensland and ultimately Australia quickly became the dream of every northern player. In south Queensland the \\"Bulimba cup\\" competition between Toowoomba, Brisbane and Ipswich teams was the major competition in Queensland rugby league well into the 1970s. When the opportunity arose, other regions in the state, including North Queensland, relished the chance to prove themselves against one of these sides. The first indication of the strength of North Queensland rugby league came in 1921 when the Townsville representative team, captained by Arch Foley, defeated Bulimba Cup champions Toowoomba. The celebrations after this victory were long and hard. Such a victory caused the rest of the rugby league world to begin to take notice of North Queensland's rugby league ability. The flagship of North Queensland rugby league quickly became the \\"A\\" grade inter town competition, which until 1948 was called the \\"Carlton Cup\\". This was revamped and renamed the 'Foley Shield' in 1948, in recognition of Arch Foley's dedication and contribution to the sport. Few northern rugby league identities are remembered as well as Arch Foley. Apart from representing Queensland in 1915 and captaining the Townsville representative sides until the 1920s, he was instrumental, along with Queensland Rugby League Secretary Harry Sunderland, securing a match between North Queensland and the 1928 touring Great Britain team. This was to be the first ever clash between the region and Great Britain, as the previous tour in 1924 only went as far north as Rockhampton. This match, played at the Townsville Sports Reserve, was a huge boost to rugby league in North Queensland. The Foley Shield competition involved two zones - \\"Northern\\" - involving Cairns, Babinda, Tully and Eacham - and \\"Southern\\" with Mackay, Ayr, and Townsville. In 1949 the \\"Central\\" zone was included involving Herbert River, Charters Towers and Home Hill. With the region's prosperity derived predominantly from sugar cane, mining and cattle, rugby league prospered. Most towns had club competitions involving three or more clubs, and gaining selection in a Foley Shield side to represent these towns was a great honour. The Foley Shield final played in Townsville became a highlight of the rugby league calendar, with many southern talent scouts and coaches attending to see the North's players in action. Despite the game's success in North Queensland, it was still generally harder for a North or Central Queensland player to be selected for higher honours simply because of the \\"out of Sight, out of mind\\" scenario. This was especially the case prior to the 1950s. Apart from 1915 when seven North Queensland based players (all from Townsville) made the Queensland side, most Queensland sides up until the 1948 involved players from Toowoomba, Brisbane or Ipswich. Players like Harry \\"Mucka\\" Fewin (Australia 1920) and Cec Aynsley (Australia 1924-28), both North Queenslanders, made their Queensland and Australian appearances from Brisbane, while Jim Bennett (Australia 1924) had played in Cairns in 1920, but again wasn't selected for his state or country until he returned to the Bulimba Cup competition. Often the only chance a northern based player had of impressing Queensland or Australian selectors was if he made the Queensland Country side, (featuring Central, and North Queensland plus Wide Bay players) to play a South Queensland team made up of Bulimba Cup players. It was a huge boost when Townsville's Bill Glasheen became the first North Queensland player to be selected for Australia when named in the 1933 Kangaroo touring squad to England. Townsville's \\"Frosty\\" Benton became the second Northern based International when selected for the 1948 Kangaroo touring squad. State League to the formation of a national team By the 1980s the Foley Shield competition was still fiercely contested, however, North Queensland sides were also selected for the Queensland State League competition. North Queensland in 1984 became the first regional side to reach the State League finals, losing to a powerful Wynnum Manly side which included Wally Lewis and three former North Queenslanders who were by now Australian representatives in Gene Miles, Colin Scott (both Townsville) and Greg Dowling (Ingham). One of the 1984 North Queensland players was 17-year-old Dale Shearer from Sarina. During the 1980s and early 1990s, North Queensland teams continued to compete in the State League competition, becoming the first regional side to win in 1991 under Coach Kerry Boustead. North Queensland's captain Laurie Spina was a veteran of eight years of Sydney football before returning home to Ingham. During 1989 Townsville rugby league administrators successfully hosted a televised National Panasonic Cup match between the Brisbane Broncos and Parramatta, attracting 16,000 spectators to the Townsville Sports reserve. This match was such a resounding success, reflecting the passion North Queenslanders had for rugby league, that journalist Doug Kingston was inspired to write a newspaper column suggesting the time was ripe for a North Queensland side to bid for inclusion in the major Rugby League competition, the NSWRL, just like Brisbane and the Gold Coast had done the year before. Some of the region's former rugby league Internationals had also suggested for some time that the North be recognised nationally in this way. Wheels were set in motion towards realising this dream, with Executive Chairman of North Queensland Newspapers Ron McLean adding his valued support. After a survey was conducted to gauge public support returned an overwhelming positive response, a major step was taken with the appointment of a promotions manager for the North Queensland bid. Former International Kerry Boustead was appointed to this task in 1990. Having widespread community, business and political support, the initial North Queensland bid committee, chaired by McLean, worked tirelessly to produce a strong case for North Queensland's inclusion. The old Willows Paceway was offered by Queensland Sports Minister Bob Gibbs to the fledgling club, with local developers such as Joe Goicoechea and Laurence Lancini taking on the redevelopment of this site. This became a major factor in the success of North Queensland's bid and widespread celebrations occurred in November 1992 with the announcement that three new clubs would join Auckland for inclusion into the \\"Australian Rugby League\\" competition, the North Queensland Cowboys being one of them. From the outset, newly appointed coach Grant Bell and his team set out to develop a club based on local talent, mixed with some experienced players from the south; a pattern that was so successful decades before in the north. The club included predominantly country bred footballers. Many of the experienced southern players signed were in fact North Queenslanders returning home. 1995, 1996: Origins The Cowboys name and team colours were decided by public competition in 1994. One of the major difficulties that faced the club in their early years was attracting followers from the more established Queensland-based Winfield Cup side, the Brisbane Broncos. This was exacerbated by an initial lack of onfield success and stability. In their first two seasons, the Cowboys had eight different captains. 1997: Super League After much court action in 1995 and 1996, a ten team Super League competition was held in 1997. The Cowboys competed in this competition, and their squad was bolstered by a number of new signings including Ian Roberts and Steve Walters. However, they were unable to improve on the club's results in previous years, and for the second time in three seasons they were to finish the season in last place. 1998, 1999: National Rugby League In 1998 the Super League and Australian Rugby League competitions merged to form the National Rugby League (NRL). The Cowboys began their first season in this competition strongly, and after six rounds they were in equal first place. Although they fell away later in the season, they were to record the largest come-back to date in an Australian first grade rugby league match, defeating the Penrith Panthers 36‚Äì28 after trailing 26‚Äì0 at half-time. 1998 also saw the Cowboys record their largest loss to date, being defeated 62‚Äì0 by the North Sydney Bears in the last round of the home and away season. The Cowboys signed their eleventh captain in 1999, Noel Goldthorpe. Paul Bowman was also to serve in that role during the season. Although their on-field performances were not spectacular, continuing high attendance figures saw aggregate attendances exceed one million spectators. This season the Cowboys also provided their first State of Origin representative when Paul Green was selected as Queensland's halfback for game 2 of the 1999 State of Origin series. 2000‚Äì2003: Improved Results In the years 2000 through to 2002 the Cowboys continued to struggle with off-field dramas and poor on-field performances. After finishing last in 2000 and second last the following year, four losses at the start of the 2002 season saw coach Tim Sheens sacked and replaced by his assistant Murray Hurst. Although they finished in their highest position to date, coach Hurst was also sacked at early in the 2003 season, and replaced by Graham Murray. The Cowboys spent much of the 2003 season in the top eight with much improved performances from a host of players, including local talents Matt Bowen and Josh Hannay. The 2003 season ended with the Cowboys four points adrift of a top eight play-off position. 2004: First time finalists After the first three rounds of the 2004 season, Cowboy supporters had little reason to smile. A first round loss to Manly at home, followed by two more home losses and a bye until the first away game of the season against Cronulla in round five saw the first win of the season. By round seven, with just one win and five losses, the Cowboys held a disappointing 13th position on the premiership ladder. Then came another away win, this time over Parramatta, which history can record as a turning point in the Club's most successful season to date. By the end of the 26 round season, the Cowboys had won 12, drawn one (the first ever draw in the NRL in the age of golden point) and lost 11, but more importantly, they held 7th position and a first ever top eight appearance. It was a tough road to success in 2004 with injuries again taking key players out of action, including Matt Sing who suffered a broken jaw in the State of Origin series and Glenn Morrison who suffered a broken back mid season. A sure sign of the growing stature of the Club was evident when new players were able to step up to the top squad from the Young Guns to cover such injuries. Players like Shane Tronc and Steve Southern were fine examples of first grade debutantes who replaced injured players and went on to play significant roles in the Club's success of 2004. The finals series proved to be of immense importance to the Club and the North Queensland community. Not only did long-term supporters have much to cheer about, but the Cowboys also captured the imagination of rugby league supporters throughout Australia with their charge into the final series. Remarkably, the Cowboys' new status in the game afforded them their first free-to-air televised game in their history. Whilst Channel Nine had all but ignored the Townsville-based team, a place in the finals had the public beating the drum for coverage. This provided Channel Nine with a last minute opportunity to jump on the Cowboys bandwagon, with Nine Commentator Ray \\"Rabbits\\" Warren branding the Cowboys as \\"2004's fairytale team\\". But for many fans throughout Queensland and in other states, such accolades were all too late from the NRL's chief free-to-air television provider who had failed to deliver coverage of the national competition. In just three finals matches, the Cowboys tasted victories over eventual premiers the Bulldogs and the Brisbane Broncos before losing narrowly to Sydney City. The semi final against the Brisbane Broncos, played in front of a packed Dairy Farmers Stadium, gave the Cowboys a chance to thank their long-term supporters, as well as welcome many new ones. After wild scenes at the Townsville airport before and after the victory over the Canterbury Bulldogs, the Cowboys played at home against the Broncos amid scenes of hysteria and adulation never before experienced as the region fully supported their team. After defeating the Broncos, they travelled to Sydney to meet eventual grand finalists Sydney Roosters and came within seconds of winning a grand final berth. Losing the preliminary final by just 16‚Äì19, the Cowboys had come of age in 2004. Apart from going within a match of a grand final appearance, the club also maintained its proud record of producing representative players. Significantly the 2004 Cowboys had a good away match record, another sign of the growing success of the club. 2005: Grand finalists 2005 would be recorded as the best ever in the Club's 11-year history. The tone of the season was set in round two, when after a first round away loss to the Brisbane Broncos, the North Queensland Toyota Cowboys won their first home match, defeating defending premiers Canterbury Bulldogs with an emphatic 24‚Äì12 win. New recruit Carl Webb set the scene by scoring a classic try, reminiscent of his 2001 Origin performance, and for most of the season the Cowboys were in a similar winning frame of mind, with a hard edge to their flamboyant attacking style, matched by solid defence. Intermittent losses punctuated the first half of the season, but leading up to Origin time the Cowboys were a dominant force, reflected in the selection of six players plus trainer Billy Johnstone in the Queensland Origin campaign. A real highlight of the season before the finals series was a huge away win three days after the first Origin match, again against Canterbury, played at the Gold coast. The speed, agility and combination of the Cowboys was simply brilliant as they swept aside the 2004 premiers for a second time in the season 48‚Äì12, with five of their players backing up after a gruelling Origin encounter. A massive victory over the Cronulla Sharks the following week meant that in the first 13 rounds of the season, the Cowboys had won eight and lost just three matches. A \\"flat\\" patch followed, however, as in the second half of the season the team began to struggle slightly with injury and suspension and recorded six wins and six losses plus a bye. Three wins came in the last three rounds of the regular season to cement a 5th spot finish and a place in the finals series campaign for the second year running. Alarm bells sounded, however, when in the first semi final, the Cowboys were hammered 6-50 by the Wests Tigers, and only favourable outcomes by other teams in the same finals round kept their campaign alive. The character and resolve of the team was very evident when they bounced back a week later with a well constructed defeat of the Melbourne Storm, putting their finals campaign back on track. A superb effort followed with the shutting out premiership favourites Parramatta in the preliminary final through a 29‚Äì0 win to book a place in the 2005 NRL Grand Final. This brilliant preliminary final victory was the biggest win by any club in such a match since 1982 when ironically Parramatta defeated the Roosters 33‚Äì0. In addition, by this preliminary final the Cowboys were the only side remaining in contention from the top four of the 2004 season. Grand Final fever hit North Queensland in style as thousands of supporters travelled to Sydney for the big day and again the team travelled to the airport via the City to allow the legion of fans, especially school children, to cheer on the side. The 2005 Grand Final had a special feel to it as two relative new football club entities, both representing districts and regions steeped in rugby league history and folklore took to the field for the decider. The West Tigers ran out eventual 30-16 winners, but the Cowboys did their fans and communities proud in the way they played the game, and also off the field, in the way they presented themselves, both as a team and as individuals. In the Queensland Wizard Cup, the depth of the North Queensland Toyota Cowboys club was evident when the North Queensland Toyota Young Guns won the competition grand final 34‚Äì4 over the Burleigh Bears. This victory at Suncorp Stadium provided inspiration to the senior side just hours before their clash with the Melbourne Storm in the major semi final. To cap a fine season, Cowboys Luke O'Donnell was named in the Kangaroo squad to play the Tri-Nations series, including the tour of England, while Billy Johnstone continued his role as Australian team trainer. In other representative matches Graham Murray continued to coach City in the annual NSW City/Country clash. The North Queensland Toyota Cowboys banner flew high over the rugby league landscape after season 2005. 2006/2007 Dairy Farmers Stadium is the home ground of the North Queensland Cowboys. It hosted two qualifying finals in 2007. The Cowboys started off the year by winning 6 straight games. One of the teams they defeated were to become the premiers, the Brisbane Broncos (in fact, the Cowboys beat them twice during the season, the second time was in a match Johnathan Thurston got seriously injured). They then fell into a hole, winning only 5 of the last 19 games, making them finish 9th on the ladder, just missing out of the finals. Much criticism has been directed at coach Murray for not sticking with a stable scrumbase pairing throughout 2006, with a number of players such as Brett Firman and Brent McConnell seen as unable to support the talents of playmaker Johnathan Thurston. The Cowboys finished the final round of regular season with a convincing win over the Parramatta Eels to give their fans some hope for 2007. Particularly impressive were hooker Aaron Payne and fullback Matthew Bowen, who recaptured some of his magic and regained some much needed form heading into the off season. Other players who have impressed throughout 2006 include Australian representative player Luke O'Donnell, as well as Carl Webb who struggled for much of the year with injuries. The ever reliable Paul Bowman continued to show the hard-fought spirit of the team despite a neck injury that struck him down at the close of the season. Aaron Payne also capped off a strong year for the club to be named Cowboy of the Year for 2006. 2006 also saw the departure of several key personal, including legendary strength and conditioner Billy Johnstone ‚Äì to the Gold Coast Titans ‚Äì and assistant coach Neil Henry accepted a head coaching position with the Canberra Raiders. The Cowboys announced that tough talking former English Super League coach Ian Millward would replace Henry as Graham Murray's assistant, with Glen Murphy taking over from Johnstone. Season 2007 may well go down as the 'one that got away' as the North Queensland Toyota Cowboys started the season strongly and went on to record 15 wins and nine losses in the premiership rounds, finishing in the top four to claim a home semi final. Only a loss to Manly in the preliminary final ruled out a second grand final appearance. A spate of injuries failed to stifle the club's success, thanks in part to several players really stepping up to take the place of injured personnel. First Luke O‚ÄôDonnell missed most of the season, then Carl Webb, Steve Southern, Shane Tronc and Sione Faumuina were missing at key times through injury. They were replaced by players considered fringe first graders at the start of season 2007 ‚Äì Ben Vaeau, Matt Bartlett, Sam Faust and Ray Cashmere. All stood up to be counted and proved they were equal to the task, with Ray Cashmere in particular winning a legion of fans with his spirited play at the back end of the season while Sam Faust proved he is a player of the future. Personal success came the way of captain Johnathan Thurston in 2007 as he claimed a second Dally M medal as well as representing both Queensland and Australia. The player of the season though was Matthew Bowen. Scoring 22 tries in 27 appearances, this was perhaps the Origin representative's finest NRL season so far. Paul Bowman, the last of the 1995 Cowboys, retired after 13 years of service and a club record of 203 first grade games at the end of 2007. He was given a rousing farewell by the home crowd and took on a coaching role with the club in 2008. Another player to retire after season 2007 was Jason Smith. Although only playing one season with the Cowboys, he provided sound experience and leadership to the 2007 squad. Jason's first grade career spanned 17 seasons, with 16 test matches for Australia and 16 Origin appearances for Queensland. He was also the last player still playing NRL to play in the very first Cowboys match on 11 March 1995, when he was with the Canterbury Bulldogs. There were some low points to the season apart from the injury toll, mainly three big losses which blew out the 'for' and 'against' scores record. The overall success of the club outweighed these uncharacteristic losses though, and by the time the semi final series began, confidence was high. After mauling the Warriors in the home semi final, the Cowboys went into the preliminary final full of confidence, but it wasn't to be. History was also made in the Queensland cup with the 2007 Toyota Young Guns the last ever to compete in the Queensland Cup. The final Toyota Young Guns season ended in similar fashion to the NRL squad, going down in the preliminary final and finishing third, with captain Shane Muspratt leading Queensland in the Residents' clash. For season 2008 both Cairns and Mackay will field sides, with former Young Guns spread between the two centres. After helping the Cowboys through a difficult period, in 2007 News Limited sold the football club to the Cowboys Leagues Club for an undisclosed sum after several months of negotiations, ending News' six-year stint as owner of the Cowboys. 2008‚Äì2010: Struggling Seasons The 2008 NRL Season was seen as a very tough year for the Cowboys. Before the season began, the club announced head coach Graham Murray's contract would not be renewed. This resulted in the clubs downfall. After only winning three of the first ten games, Murray resigned from his job. The club then confirmed assistant coach Ian Millward would take over the duties for the rest of the season. During his stint as head coach, the club could only win two more games. This season saw the club break their previous record of 10 consecutive losses by losing 13 straight matches from round 4 until the club broke the record in round 22 by beating the Canterbury Bulldogs 36‚Äì12. The Cowboys throughout the season were decimated by injuries and suspensions as well as off-field issues. In the end, the Cowboys finished 15th on the ladder avoiding the wooden spoon by for and against. The club did have some positives with Johnathan Thurston named in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup squad for Australia as well as being picked for Queensland along with Carl Webb and Jacob Lillyman. 2009 saw the appointment of Neil Henry as head coach which saw some hope for the club after winning NRL Coach of the Year with the Canberra Raiders the previous year. Throughout the year, the club were poised to make the finals however, the club slumped the consecutive losses to miss out on playing in the finals for the second straight year. 2009 also saw Matthew Bowen score his 100th try becoming the first Cowboy to score 100 tries for the club. The beginning out the 2010 season was the speculation of whether Johnathan Thurston would renew his contract with the club. This included the club signing Thurston's friend and former teammate Willie Mason. Thurston did renew for another three seasons however it brought very little success. The club finished 15th however, the club would have received the wooden spoon if Melbourne Storm did not lose all of their competition points. 2010 saw the emergence of Scott Bolton and seeing the test debut of Matthew Scott. Also the club had a new record with Jason Taumalolo making his debut against the Canterbury Bulldogs in round 24 aged 17 years and 82 days. 2011‚Äì2013: Return to the Finals After missing the finals for the last 3 seasons the Cowboys underwent a major overhaul of personnel for the 2011 season. Club legend Ty Williams retired and they parted ways with club favourites Luke O'Donnell, Carl Webb and Steve Southern. Their biggest signing for the 2011 season was Queensland and Australian representative centre Brent Tate. They also made key recruits in the signings of former Melbourne Storm and Queensland State of Origin representative Dallas Johnson and premiership winner Glenn Hall from the English Super League, re-signing a former Cowboy in Gavin Cooper and picking up younger, experienced first graders such as Antonio Winterstein. Perhaps their most underrated off-season recruit at the time was the 20-year-old, 2010 Toyota Cup player of the year Tariq Sims, from the Brisbane Broncos. Sims, who joined the Cowboys with older brother Ashton, would have a stand out year in 2011. Being earmarked as a future NSW and Australian representative. The Cowboys' new signings had a positive impact on the NRL team, with the Cowboys spending much of the year in the top four before a late slide dropped them to seventh position and giving them their first finals appearance since 2007. In the qualifying final, North Queensland led Manly 8‚Äì0 at half time before being overrun by the Sea Eagles who went on to claim the premiership. Winger Kalifa Faifai Loa made his debut for New Zealand at the end of the season, James Segeyaro and Ray Thompson made their debuts for Papua New Guinea and Joel Riethmuller represented Italy for the first time in the European qualifiers for the 2013 World Cup. 2012 saw the Cowboys return to the finals after finishing in 5th spot. They faced the Broncos in the first week of the finals, winning 33‚Äì16, with halfback Michael Morgan scoring a hat trick. They lost the following week to Manly, in controversial circumstances. Club legend Aaron Payne retired at the end of the season, after 10 years with the team. The Cowboys again made the finals in 2013, the first time the club had made the finals series three straight years, when they finished in 8th place. After a poor start to the season, the side went on a 6-game winning streak following the sacking of coach Neil Henry. They were eliminated in Week 1 of the finals, after a controversial loss to the Cronulla Sharks. Club legend Matthew Bowen played his last season in the NRL, announcing he would be taking up an offer with Super League side, the Wigan Warriors. Club stalwarts Ashley Graham and Dallas Johnson also announced their retirements. On 1 October 2013, former Cowboys halfback Paul Green was announced as head coach for the 2014 and 2015 seasons, becoming the first former Cowboys player to coach the club. 2014 ‚Äì Current: A new era and the club's first NRL Telstra premiership The Cowboys started their 2014 season by winning the inaugural NRL Auckland Nines tournament which was held at Eden Park in Auckland. After losing key signing Lachlan Coote early in the tournament to injury, the Cowboys went on to face the Brisbane Broncos in the final, defeating them 16‚Äì7 to claim the trophy and a prize money cheque of $370,000. Cowboys winger Kyle Feldt was awarded the Breakout Player of the Tournament award, while Gavin Cooper, Kane Linnett, James Tamou and Antonio Winterstein were named in the Team of the Tournament. The Cowboys finished in 5th place in 2014, with a rocky start to the season and a string of injuries to key players including internationals Brent Tate and Matt Scott, The Cowboys made a late charge to the finals winning the majority of their games and cementing a spot in the finals where they defeated the Brisbane Broncos 32‚Äì20 at their home ground in Townsville. They then travelled to Sydney to face the 2013 premiers the Sydney Roosters in the second week of the finals where they were defeated 31‚Äì30. After coming back from an early 30-point deficit Jonathan Thurston appeared to score with 56 seconds remaining before being ruled a no try by the officials ending their charge to the grand final ‚Äì the third consecutive year that the Cowboys had been eliminated from the finals in controversial fashion. The Cowboys farewelled Brent Tate (retired), Ashton Sims (Warrington Wolves), Tariq Sims (Newcastle Knights) and Curtis Rona (Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs) at the end of the season. On 26 September 2015, the Cowboys qualified for only their second grand final defeating Melbourne 32‚Äì12 in the Preliminary Final in Melbourne. In the final, they beat the Brisbane Broncos in extra time in one of the closest grand finals in history, ending with a final score of 17‚Äì16. The game was won by a 'golden point' field goal taken by Johnathan Thurston on the fourth tackle of the first set of extra time, allowing the North Queensland Cowboys to win their first ever grand final. Thurston had helped create the last minute try that tied the game in regular time and then scraped the post as his conversion attempt was unsuccessful. Johnathan Thurston took home the Clive Churchill Medal for best on ground in the Grand Final.

He was a leading proponent of expansionism in Japan before World War II but later became a pacifist and was Japan's first Minister to Australia. Early years Kawai was born in Fukuyama, Hiroshima Prefecture, and he graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in 1915. He passed the diplomatic service examination in 1918 and was appointed vice-consul to Tsinan, China in 1919. He was promoted in 1921 and served as Secretary to the Japanese Embassy in Washington, D.C. and then Secretary to the Department of Commerce in 1921. He became the Japanese Consul to Vancouver in 1925 and Tsingtao in 1928. He became Chief of the Foreign Department of the Kwantung Leased Territory in 1930 and Secretary to the Japanese Advisor to the Lytton Commission of the League of Nations. He was appointed Consul-General to Canton in 1934 and Shanghai in 1938. Kawai was an ardent expansionist and in 1938 published The Goal of Japanese Expansion, which was published in Japanese, English and Russian, and the following year translated into Spanish. In 1938 he also published ÊîØÈÇ£‰∫ãÂ§â„Å®Â∏ùÂõΩÂ§ñ‰∫§ (The China Incident and Imperial Diplomacy), which was only available in Japanese. In 1938 he was promoted to Director of the Information Bureau and official spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo. In 1939 he served briefly as Japanese Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Europe and the United States before returning to Japan. Sir Robert Craigie, British Ambassador to Japan, later noted that \\"during his term of office as official 'spokesman' ... he displayed on several occasions open hostility to our attitude as regards Japanese actions in China and he was unpopular amongst the foreign newspaper correspondents owing to his somewhat rough manner and indifferent command of English\\". After leading a strike at the Foreign Ministry in 1940, he was sacked as an official spokesman but was appointed roving ambassador to Nazi-occupied Europe. It was during this appointment he became a pacifist. Minister to Australia Kawai's appointment to his new position as Japan's first Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Australia was officially announced on 2 January 1941; he arrived in Australia on 13 March of the same year. Kawai developed a close friendship with future Prime Minister of Australia John Curtin. In early 1941, when Curtin was still Leader of the Opposition, they reached an agreement to boost trade and to allow Japanese access to iron ore in Western Australia in exchange for Japan \\"guaranteeing Australia's safety\\".Wurth , B. Saving Australia, Curtin‚Äôs secret peace with Japan, Lothian Books, 2006. In July 1941, Time quoted Kawai as saying he was tired of hearing the word \\"drive\\" to describe Japan's intentions and that territorial expansion was an old-fashioned phrase. Telegram from Kawai to John Curtin expressing sympathy at the loss of HMAS Sydney. He was the guest of honour at a formal dinner held by Curtin in Perth and dined privately with the Curtins many times. He was also a guest at The Lodge after Curtin became Prime Minister, and at the opening of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra on 11 November 1941. He sent a telegram to Curtin expressing his sympathy at the loss of HMAS Sydney on 1 December 1941, only days before Australia declared war on Japan. Some authors believe that the telegram was sent on 27 November 1941, based on the number \\"27\\" that appears in the first line of typed text. This appears not to be correct. The entry \\"X 15 SYDNEY\\" identifies the Office of Origin, the numeral \\"27\\" the number of words used (H M A S amounting to four words), and the entry \\"11-57 AM\\" is the time the telegram was lodged. These entries coincide with the headings above them. World War II Kawai warned Curtin at the conclusion of the American‚ÄìJapanese talks in Washington, D.C. that \\"the momentum may have gone too far\\" to prevent war, prompting Curtin to recall his War Cabinet on 5 December 1941. Kawai was kept under house arrest at the Japanese embassy at the outbreak of the Pacific War and deported to Japan in August 1942, taking with him the ashes of four of the Japanese submariners killed in the attack on Sydney Harbour. Kawai was ostracised in Japan when he called on Japanese not to hate Australians and was sacked from the Foreign Ministry. Towards the end of the war he secretly worked for peace with Shigeru Yoshida. Immediately after the war he became vice foreign minister under Yoshida. Later life After the war he became head of the Japan Australia Society, an organisation promoting trade and friendship between the two countries. He resumed contact with the Curtin family, visiting John Curtin's grave in 1959. He died in 1965. His son, Masumi Kawai, became managing director of Mitsui's Australian subsidiary, Mitsui Australia.

Image from Mus√©e de l'√âlys√©e, Lausanne. The Holy Face of Jesus is a title for specific images which some Catholics believe to be miraculously-formed representations of the face of Jesus Christ. The image obtained from the Shroud of Turin is associated with a specific medal worn by some Roman Catholics and is also one of the Catholic devotions to Christ.Ann Ball, Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices 2003 pages 635 and 239 Various acheiropoieta (literally \\"not-handmade\\") items relating to Christ have been reported throughout the centuries, and devotions to the face of Jesus have been practiced. Devotions to the Holy Face were approved by Pope Leo XIII in 1895 and Pope Pius XII in 1958.Joan Carroll Cruz, OCDS, 2003, Saintly Men of Modern Times page 200 In the Roman Catholic tradition, the Holy Face of Jesus is used in conjunction with Acts of Reparation to Jesus ChristAlban Butler, 2007, Lives of the Saints, page 28 with specific institutions whose focus is such reparations, e.g. the Pontifical Congregation of the Benedictine Sisters of the Reparation of the Holy Face. In his address to this Congregation, Pope John Paul II referred to such Acts of Reparation as the \\"unceasing effort to stand beside the endless crosses on which the Son of God continues to be crucified\\".Vatican website: Letter of Pope John Paul II to Sister of the Reparation of the Holy Face, 27 September 2000 The Veronica Veronica's veil, by Claude Mellan (c. 1649). Belief in the existence of authentic images of Christ is connected with the old legend of Abgar of Edessa regarding the \\"Mandylion\\", and the apocryphal writing known as the \\"Mors Pilati\\", Acts of Pilate, regarding the \\"veil of Veronica\\".D√©gert, Antoine. \\"St. Veronica.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 9 April 2017 The oldest and best known of these images was called the vera icon (true image), which in ordinary language became known as \\"veronica\\". According to tradition Veronica encountered Jesus along the Via Dolorosa on the way to Calvary. When she paused to wipe the blood and sweat off his face with her veil, his image was imprinted on the cloth. The story is not recorded in its present form until the Middle Ages. The event is commemorated by the Sixth Station of the Cross. Marie of St Peter Eluere Sister Marie of St Peter In 1844 Sister Marie of St Peter, a Carmelite nun in Tours, France, reported an interior locution in which Jesus told her, \\"Those who will contemplate the wounds on My Face here on earth, shall contemplate it radiant in heaven.\\"Ann Ball, Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices 2003 pages 209-210 She later reported further \\"communications\\", as she termed them, with Jesus and the Virgin Mary in which she was urged to spread the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, in reparation for the many insults Jesus suffered in his Passion.Dorothy Scallan, et al. 1994 The Life & Revelations of Sr. Mary of St. Peter Devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus started to spread among Roman Catholics in France.Joan Carroll Cruz, OCDS, Saintly Men of Modern Times (2003) pages 194-197 Leo Dupont Leo Dupont, Apostle of the Holy Face Leo Dupont was a religious man from a noble family who had moved to Tours. In 1849 he had started the nightly Eucharistic Adoration movement in Tours, from where it spread within France. He later came to be known as the \\"Holy Man of Tours\\". Upon hearing of Sister Marie of St Peter‚Äôs reported visions, he started to burn a vigil lamp continuously before a picture of the Holy Face of Jesus, at that time an image based on the Veil of Veronica.Pierre D√©sir√© Janvier, The Life of Leon Papin-Dupont: the Holy Man Of Tours. Kessinger Publishing (2008) Dupont prayed for and promoted the case for a devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus for around 30 years. But the documents pertaining to the life of sister Marie of St. Peter and the devotion were kept by the Church and not released. Yet Dupont persisted. Eventually, in 1874 Charles-Th√©odore Colet was appointed as the new Archbishop of Tours. Archbishop Colet examined the documents and in 1876 gave permission for them to be published and the devotion encouraged, shortly before Dupont died. Dupont was thereafter at times referred to as the Apostle of the Holy Face.Slater, Thomas. \\"Reparation.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 9 April. 2017 When Leo Dupont died in 1876, his house on Rue St. Etienne in Tours was purchased by the Archdiocese of Tours and turned into the Oratory of the Holy Face. The oratory is administered by an order of priests called the Priests of the Holy Face, canonically erected in 1876. The Devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus was approved by Pope Leo XIII in 1885, who expressed a desire to establish a similar oratory in Rome. Relics by Joan Carroll Cruz (Sep 1984) OSV Press, page 57 This was eventually opened in the Via Pietro Cavallini in 1891 and administered by the Priests, but was demolished in subsequent redevelopment. Mario Armellini: Chiese di Roma 1891 p.794 Th√©r√®se of Lisieux Th√©r√®se of Lisieux was a French nun who received the Carmelite habit in 1889 and later became known by the religious name \\"St. Th√©r√®se of the Child Jesus and of the Holy Face\\". She was introduced to the Holy Face devotion through her blood sister Pauline, Sister Agn√®s of Jesus. Th√©r√®se wrote many prayers to express the devotion to the Holy Face.Ann Laforest, Th√©r√®se of Lisieux: the way to love, page 61 She wrote the words \\"Make me resemble you, Jesus!\\" on a small card and attached a stamp of the Holy Face to it. She pinned the prayer in a small container over her heart since at that time the Holy Face Medal did not exist. In August 1895, in her \\"Canticle to the Holy Face\\" she wrote: \\"Jesus, Your ineffable image is the star which guides my steps. Ah, You know, Your sweet Face is for me Heaven on earth. My love discovers the charms of Your Face adorned with tears. I smile through my own tears when I contemplate Your sorrows.\\" Th√©r√®se also composed the Holy Face prayer for sinners: \\"Eternal Father, since Thou hast given me for my inheritance the adorable Face of Thy Divine Son, I offer that face to Thee and I beg Thee, in exchange for this coin of infinite value, to forget the ingratitude of souls dedicated to Thee and to pardon all poor sinners. Shroud of Turin A broader devotion to the Holy Face is based on the image used on the Shroud of Turin which some believe to be the burial cloth of Jesus. It is different from the likeness of Jesus on the Veil of Veronica, although the veil image had earlier been used in devotions. Since the Holy Face image is said to have been obtained from the burial cloth of Jesus, it is assumed to be a post-crucifixion image. However, the likeness on the Veil of Veronica is by definition pre-crucifixion, for it is assumed to have been imprinted when Veronica encountered Jesus in Jerusalem along the Via Dolorosa on the way to Calvary. Although the Shroud of Turin has been publicly displayed by Roman Catholics at least since the 16th century, the faint image of the Holy Face on it cannot be clearly seen with the naked eye and was only observed with the advent of photography. In 1898, amateur Italian photographer Secondo Pia was startled by the negative of the image in his darkroom as he was developing the first photograph of the shroud. The happenstance by which Secondo Pia received the King‚Äôs approval to attempt the first photograph of the Shroud for an exhibition was unusual in its own right. And Pia later said that on the evening of May 28, 1898, he almost dropped and broke the photographic plate in the darkroom from the shock of seeing the image of a face on the Shroud (for the first time ever) that could not have been clearly observed with the naked eye. Hence devotions to the Holy Face prior to that year relied on earlier images, based on paintings of the Veil of Veronica. Maria Pierina De Micheli On the first Friday in Lent 1936, Sister Maria Pierina De Micheli, who was born near Milan Italy, reported a vision in which Jesus told her: ‚ÄúI will that My Face, which reflects the intimate pains of My Spirit, the suffering and the love of My Heart, be more honored. He who meditates upon Me, consoles Me‚Äù. Further reported visions of Jesus and Mary urged Sister Maria Pierina to make a medal with the Holy Face of Jesus. This became known as the Holy Face Medal. On one side the medal bears a replica of the Holy Face image from Shroud of Turin and an inscription based on Psalm 66:2: \\"Illumina, Domine, vultum tuum super nos\\", i.e. \\"May, O Lord, the light of Thy countenance shine upon us\\". On the other side of the medal there is an image of a radiant Sacred Host, the monogram of the Holy Name (\\"IHS\\"), and the inscription \\"Mane nobiscum, Domine\\" i.e. \\"Stay with us, O Lord\\". In another vision, Sister Maria Pierina reported that Jesus told her: ‚ÄúEvery time my Face is contemplated I will pour out my love into the heart of those persons, and by means of my Holy Face the salvation of many souls will be obtained‚Äù. She further reported that Jesus wanted a special Feast on the day before Ash Wednesday in honor of His Holy Face, to be preceded by a Novena (9 days) of prayers. After some effort Sister Maria Pierina managed to obtain permission to cast the medal and its use started to grow in Italy. As World War II started, many soldiers and sailors were given a Holy Face Medal as a means of protection. Sister Maria Pierina herself died in 1945 at the end of the war. In 2000 Pope John Paul II stated that the inscription \\"Illumina, Domine, Vultum tuum super nos\\" on the Holy Face Medal underscores the need for deeper reflection on the Face of Jesus and the spread of devotion to it.  Vatican approval and Feast Day The first medal of the Holy Face was offered to Pope Pius XII who approved of the devotion and the medal. In 1958 he formally declared the Feast of the Holy Face of Jesus as Shrove Tuesday (the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday) for all Roman Catholics. On the occasion of the 100th year of Secondo Pia's (May 28, 1898) first photograph of the Shroud of Turin, on Sunday May 24, 1998, Pope John Paul II visited the Turin Cathedral. In his address on that day, he said:\\"the Shroud is an image of God's love as well as of human sin\\" and \\"it is an icon of the suffering of the innocent in every age.\\"Vatican website: Address of John Paul II in Turin Cathedral, 24 May 1998 The Holy Face devotion and the Holy Face Medal spread among Roman Catholics worldwide, with organizations such as the Holy Face Association. Theological analysis In his 2005 book On the Way to Jesus Christ, Pope Benedict XVI performed an analysis of Holy Face devotions, and characterized them as having three separate components.On the Way to Jesus Christ by Pope Benedict XVI and Michael J. Miller (October 8, 2005) pages 28-30 The first element is discipleship, and the orientation of one's life towards an encounter with Jesus. The second element is seeing Jesus in the Eucharist. The third element is eschatological, and is interwoven between the other two. Referring to Matthew 25:31-36 Benedict XVI stated that the first element (i.e. discipleship) involves seeing Jesus in the face of the poor and the oppressed, and caring for them, but to properly see Jesus in the face of those in need, believers first need to become better acquainted with Jesus through the Eucharist. The second element involves relating the Passion of Jesus, and the suffering expressed by the images that represent his wounded face to the Eucharistic experience. Thus the devotion that starts with the images of the face of Jesus leads to his contemplation in the Eucharistic experience. The eschatological element then builds on awakening to Christ by contemplating his face in the Eucharist. Institute for Holy Face research The International Institute for Research on the Face of Christ was formed in 1997 by Cardinal Fiorenzo Angelini and the Benedictine Sisters of the Reparation of the Holy Face in Rome. In his message to the 6th annual conference of the Institute held in Rome in October 2002, Pope John Paul II emphasized the spiritual importance of contemplation of the Face of Christ and referred to his Apostolic Letter Novo Millennio Ineunte which stated:Vatican website: Novo Millennio Ineunte, January 6, 2001 :And is it not the Church's task to reflect the light of Christ in every historical period, to make his face shine also before the generations of the new millennium? Our witness, however, would be hopelessly inadequate if we ourselves had not first contemplated his face. In the same message John Paul II also related the theme of the contemplation to that of contemplating the Person of Christ as discussed in his first encyclical Redemptor hominis.

During World War II he served in the US Army. His degrees were from Harvard, Oxford (where he was a Rhodes Scholar at Jesus College from 1949 to 1951) and Grinnell College. He developed the model of institutional cruelty. Institutional cruelty Institutional cruelty is a model developed by Philip Hallie, who believes ethics are rooted in passion and common sense rather than in technical science. Hallie defines \\"institutional cruelty\\" as a persistent pattern of humiliation that endures for years in a community, but the victimizer and the victim find ways to downplay the harm that is being done. Both the victim and the victimizer justify cruel actions based on what they have been led to believe is \\"actual\\" inferiority. Hallie argues that cruelty is created by an imbalance of power, or hierarchy. According to his view, the opposite of institutionalized cruelty is freedom from the cruel relationship, not just kindness. Institutional cruelty demotes individuality. Hallie sites a quote from a Nazi SS Officer stating, \\"Commitment [to an institution] that overrides all sentimentality transforms cruelty and destruction into moral nobility, and commitment is the lifeblood of an institution,\\" (Hallie \\"From Cruelty to Goodness\\" 7). Published works Hallie's work generally explores the nature of ethics‚Äîgood and evil, cruelty and kindness. His writing and statements have made particular reference to the admiration he holds for members of the French Resistance at Le Chambon-sur-Lignon.Hallie, Philip.

He explains that all cruelty derives from a deficit in power. Examples are used such as Nazi concentration camps and slavery. \\"The power of the majority and the weakness of a minority were at the center of institutional cruelty of slavery and Nazi anti-Semitism.\\" He also emphasizes that deep humiliation in institutionalized cruelty can be just as hurtful to the victim as episodic cruelty, cruelty where both the victim and the victimizer are aware of the harm being committed. He then goes on to purport that the redress of stopping cruelty isn't enough to negate or perfectly oppose cruelty. Hospitality is the only cure for cruelty. \\"It lies in unsentimental, efficacious love.\\"Hallie, Philip. \\"From Cruelty to Goodness\\" in Christina Sommers & Fred Sommers, Vice and Virtue in Everyday Life, Harcourt College Publishers (2001) pp. 14-15.

Geographical condition Formerly shallow Shen Nong Stream made into a major river, as it falls into the Yangtze near Badong The Three Gorges Reservoir Region is located in the upstream of the Yangtze River at the boundary of Chongqing municipality and Hubei province with the area of 59900 km¬≤ and with the population of 16 million. The Three Gorges Reservoir Region stretches along the Yangtze River from Jiangjin District of Chongqing to Yichang City of Hubei, which is very narrow and where the geography is complex. The mountainous areas represent 74% of the region only with 4.3% plain area in the river valley and 21.7% hilly area. The climate of the reservoir region of the Three Gorges Project is the subtropical monsoon climate. Its location is in the transfer between the northern temperate zone and the subtropical zone, where it is hot and it rains a lot with the annual rainfall of about 1100 mm. The valley of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region below 500 m has an annual temperature 17‚Äì19 ¬∞C and, with the frost-free period annually lasts 300‚Äì340 days. The annual runoff flow at the site of the dam of the Three Gorges Project is 451 billion m¬≥ with the annual sediment discharge of 530 million tons. Natural and ecological resources The Three Gorges abounds in water resources, ecological resources, tourism resources, and the resources of some ores, which have a great potential for exploration. The Yangtze River flows through the Three Gorges Reservoir Region with the good conditions for water transportation and the water-resources development. The potential installed capacity of hydropower can be about 30,000 MW in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region where the water resources are the most abundant for the whole main stream of the Yangtze River. Since the conditions of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region for the development of the water resources are good with a short distance to the load center, there is great potential for development of the water resources. The agricultural resources of the Three Gorges Region are abundant, which are superior for the agriculture, forestry, livestock, sideline production and fishery. The Three Gorges Reservoir Region is proper for the growth of the various plants of both the warm temperate zone and the temperate zone. Dozens of ores have been explored and investigated in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, such as gold, silver, copper, iron, uranium, sulfur, potassium, natural gas and halite. The natural sights along the Yangtze River in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region are superb, particularly the along 162-km main river between Sandouping of Yichang and Baidicheng Town of Fengjie, which are the famous sights of the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River and one of the tourist places of interest all over the world. In addition, there are a lot of cultural and historical sites, such as the Qu Yuan Temple of Zigui, the Zhaojun Home Village of Xingshan, the Shibao Stockade of Zhong County and the ghost town of Fengdu. Economy Water level in the reservoir (at the moment, 146 m above the sea level) measured by a shore marker. (Zigui County) The Three Gorges Reservoir Region is an important part of the economic zone along the Yangtze River. The region is significant for both the promotion to the economic growth of the areas along the Yangtze River and the economic exchanges between the east of China and the west of China. The region is now and will be more and more superior for the economic progress of China with the gradual opening up to the world and the gradual economic promotion from the coastal areas to the river regions and the inland areas, especially with the construction of the Three Gorges Project. Furthermore, the Three Gorges Region is now and will be more and more significant for the economic progress of China. The Three Gorges Region has made its economic aims as follows. * To gradually build up the largest hydropower base in China; * To form an important industrial region midstream and upstream of the Yangtze River; * To have its particular places of interest for tourism; * To realize the preliminary economic prosperity; * To build up the beautiful environments; * To have a good resettlement of the local people; * To make a new reservoir region with both the rapid economic progress and the good settlement of the immigrants. During the second phase of reservoir water storage, 25 county-level divisions were involved in the submersion of the reservoir water storage. But from 1992 up to 2002, they had changed a lot as follows. * Their total GDP had increased 4.1 times, that is, from 8.24 billion RMB yuan to 42.19 billion RMB yuan; * Their annual growth rate is 17.7%; * Their annual GDP per head had increased from 906 RMB yuan to 4427 RMB yuan; * The third industry had properly increased; * The first industry had largely decreased; * The second industry had largely increased; * The percentages of the first, the second and the third industries had changed from 41%, 30% and 29% to 21%, 43% and 36%; * The total industrial output on the basis of the pricing of 1990 had increased at the rate of 15.7% from 5.64 billion RMB yuan to 24.28 billion RMB yuan, and the total regional industrial output of 2002 was 3.3 times that of 1992; * The regional revenue had increased at the rate of 16.2% from 790 million RMB yuan to 3.54 billion RMB yuan; * The annual taxes of the local industrial enterprises had increased at the rate of 19.2% from 420 million RMB yuan to 2.43 billion RMB yuan, and the total annual regional taxes of the local industrial enterprises of 2002 was 4.8 times those of 1992; * The profits of the local industrial enterprises had changed from -114,500 RMB yuan after the counteraction between the profits and the losses to 720 million RMB yuan after the counteraction between the profits and the losses.

Named for Amycus (in Greek mythology, the son of Poseidon and Melia), she was the only US Naval vessel to bear the name. Construction Originally projected as LST-489, an , this ship was redesignated ARL-2 and named Amycus on 13 January 1943. She was laid down on 17 January 1943, under Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 1009, by Kaiser Shipyards, Yard No. 4, Richmond, California; launched on 2 April 1943; delivered on 3 June 1943, to the Matson Navigation Company, San Francisco, for conversion to a landing craft repair ship; and commissioned on 30 July 1943, Lieutenant John J. Reidy, Jr., USNR, in command. Service history Amycus conducted shakedown training along the California coast before departing San Diego on 20 September 1943, and heading for the South Pacific to join the Service Forces of the US 7th Fleet. She made port calls at Pago Pago, American Samoa; Noumea, New Caledonia; Brisbane and Port of Townsville, Australia; and Milne Bay, New Guinea. On 29 November, the vessel arrived at Buna, Papua New Guinea where she joined Task Force 76 (TF 76). She remained at Buna until late April 1944, servicing and repairing small escort vessels and landing boats. On 25 April 1944, Amycus got underway for Cape Cretin, New Guinea, where she joined a convoy bound for Hollandia. She reached that base on 3 May, and assumed duty as a repair ship and the flagship of the landing craft control officer. The ship remained in Humboldt Bay through the summer and autumn carrying out repair and tender services for various landing craft. On 20 December, Amycus left Hollandia and proceeded to Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island. A week later, she sortied with a task group destined to take part in the Lingayen Gulf landings. As her convoy crossed the South China Sea, there were numerous air raid alerts, but only one attack materialized. On 7 January 1945, two enemy planes came in low to attack. One was shot down by a screening vessel, and the other broke off her approach and escaped undamaged. Amycus anchored in Lingayen Gulf on 9 January, and the bombardment of the Luzon beaches began at 07:00 that day. Shortly thereafter, the ship began repairing battle-damaged landing craft. During the Allied assault, Amycus fired intermittently at enemy aircraft. While at anchor on 29 January, a friendly plane accidentally jettisoned a bomb which exploded about off her port quarter. Shrapnel from the explosion killed three and wounded nine crew members and caused minor damage to the repair ship's hull. Amycus remained in Lingayen Gulf through 26 June, when she sailed for Subic Bay in the Philippine Islands. Upon her arrival there, the ship operated under Service Squadron 3 at the naval base at Subic Bay. The Japanese surrender in August found Amycus still providing services at Subic Bay. She remained there until 27 October, when she shaped a course for the United States. Post-war service The ship reached San Francisco on 30 November 1945, and later steamed to Portland, Oregon. Decommissioned on 15 November 1946, she joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet in the Columbia River. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 June 1970. She was sold for scrap on 13 August 1971, to Zidell Explorations, Inc., of Portland. Awards Amycus earned two battle stars for her World War II service.

The Lambro rises from the Monte San Primo, elevation , near the Ghisallo, in the province of Como, not far from Lake Como. After Magreglio it flows through the Valassina and the comuni of Asso, Ponte Lambro and Erba, entering Lake Pusiano with the name of Lambrone. The Lambro passes through Brianza reaching Monza and crossing its famous park (where king Umberto I was assassinated by Gaetano Bresci) in two branches which join again before the river passes through the eastern part of Milan. At Melegnano it receives the waters of the Vettabbia and, at Sant'Angelo Lodigiano, those of its main tributary, the Lambro meridionale (\\"Southern Lambro\\"), almost doubling its discharge. The Lambro flows into the Po near Orio Litta. At the average discharge of the Lambro is relatively small, but it can be occasionally boosted to 40 m¬≥/s or more by the Milanese water drains and dangerous floods are frequent in the rainy seasons. The name Lambro was used for a popular three-wheeler commercial transport vehicle produced by Milanese automaker Innocenti, which also made the Lambretta motor scooters. Etymology According to Pokorny's Indogermanisches etymologisches W√∂rterbuch (Indo-European Etymological Dictionary), 1132 (leg ∑h-), Lambrus corresponds to Greek ·ºêŒªŒ±œÜœÅœåœÇ, meaning 'light (in weight), quick, nimble' ('leicht, flink' in German) and is related to Illyrian lembus (*leng ∑ho-s) 'light vehicle' ('leichtes Fahrzeug' in German), whence also Greek ŒªŒ≠ŒºŒ≤ŒøœÇ. Pokorny cites Krahe, Gymnasium 59 (1952), p. 79\\\\. Pollution Lambro drains a very densely populated and heavily industrialized zone, including a significant portion of the Milan metropolitan area with a population of more than 3,000,000. Before the construction of a treatment plant in 2002, almost all of the sewage from the city of Milan flowed untreated into the river, as well as industrial sewages. Saboteur oil spill Despite the implementation of sewage treatment, overall water quality remained poor, until the major disaster of 23 February 2010, when unknown criminals poured into the river, near Villasanta, the contents of several silos containing oil and other hydrocarbons, all belonging to a company named \\"Lombardia Petroli\\". This oily mass, estimated at over , followed the entire length of the river, despite both local authorities and civil defence's efforts in order to stop the flow, then reached Po river. This disaster caused considerable damage to wildlife and vegetation, both in Lambro and in Po, and its effects will be evident for many years afterwards, making it one of the worst environmental crises in recent history in Italy.NICOLE WINFIELD \\"Lambro River Oil Spill May Create 'Ecological Disaster' In Italy\\" Huffington Post, 2010-02-24 References Category:Rivers of Italy Category:Rivers of the Province of Como Category:Rivers of the Province of Lecco Category:Rivers of the Province of Monza and Brianza Category:Rivers of the Province of Milan Category:Rivers of the Province of Lodi Category:Rivers of the Province of Pavia ","title":"Lambro"},{"id":"10848989","text":"Adam and Eve, from the workshop of Giovanni della Robbia, with the Salviati arms at lower right (The Walters Art Museum) The Salviati is an Italian family that was prominent in the Republic of Florence.

Cutlip started in newspapers with the Buckhannon Record in 1933. Moving to Morgantown, West Virginia in 1935, he worked for the West Virginia Newspaper Publishing Company for three years. In 1939 he obtained a bachelor's degree in journalism and political science from Syracuse University. His career in public relations began in 1941 with the West Virginia State Road Commission. In Madison, Wisconsin he continued to study journalism and political science, earning a master's degree from the University of Wisconsin. In 1942 he entered the United States Army Air Forces, where he served with the Fifth Air Force from Australia. He joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin in 1946, teaching news editing and introducing the study of public relations.Hallahan, K. (2013). Scott M. Cutlip. In R. L.

In 1957 Cutlip produced a bibliography on public relations (updated in 1965), and in 1965 he authored a book on fundraising in the United States. At the University of Georgia from 1976 to 1983, Cutlip served as dean of the Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication.Obituary by University of Georgia In 1994 and 1995 Cutlip published two histories of public relations that develop the practices through the stories of professional operators. Cutlip was a member of the Public Relations Society of America and the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication. Philosophy of public relations Cutlip issued the call to study: :\\"Public relations strategies and tactics are increasingly used as weapons of power in our no-holds-barred political, economic, and cause competition in the public opinion marketplace, and thus deserve more scholarly scrutiny than they have had.\\" Cutlip expressed the opinion that public relations is a \\"vital cog in the nation‚Äôs information system\\" in the prologueCutlip 1994 xii, xiii to his book The Unseen Power. He describes the public system as consisting of \\"government ‚Äì federal, state, and local, political parties, pressure groups, non-profit organizations, public relations personnel, and the channels of communication, manned by reporters, editors, and gatekeepers\\". He noted that since citizens depend on this system, practitioners have a social responsibility while they skilfully advocate on behalf of clients. At best, a public relations counselor may inform a CEO or board of directors of a client firm of necessities when contending with negative public opinion. For instance, advice may avoid a loss of market share and thus prove valuable. More generally, public relations practitioners enrich public dialogue and consolidate the frayed threads of discord. Cutlip conceded that practice may contribute to congestion and corrosion of communication channels. As practitioners of the craft, Cutlip listed \\"propagandist, press agent, public information officer, public relations or public affairs official, political campaign specialist, lobbyist\\". The occupations operate under conditions of free speech. In a democracy, it is the informed votes of citizens that rights a listing ship of state, according to Milton. Cutlip also cited Hugo Black of the U. S. Supreme Court re-affirming the free speech context of practitioners in 1961. University colleagues Merrill Jensen and Merle Curti challenged Cutlip to defend devious tactics of public relations practitioners. They saw public relations for its corrosive effect of undermining public trust and leading to cynicism. For his part, Cutlip noted that \\"only through the expertise of public relations can causes, industries, individuals and institutions make their voices heard in the public forum where thousands of shrill, competing voices daily recreate the Tower of Babel.\\" \\"The impact of public relations counselling can be seen ... in the more socially responsible business leadership that emerged in the wake of the Depression and the New Deal.\\" Awards In 1971 Cutlip was presented the honorary degree Litt. D. by West Virginia Wesleyan College of Buckhannon. In 1972 Cutlip was recognized with the first Outstanding Educator Award presented by the Public Relations Society of America. In 1984 he received the Commander's Award for Public Service from the Department of the Army and in 2003 was inducted into the U.S. Army Public Affairs Hall of Fame.https://www.army.mil/info/institution/publicAffairs/halloffame/ In 1987 he was nominated to the Hall of Fame of the Arthur W.

Rochford was formerly a co-host of Network Ten's Breakfast program alongside Paul Henry and Kathryn Robinson and National Medical Editor on the Seven Network. Personal life Rochford was born in Sydney, New South Wales, and grew up on the Northern Beaches. He attended secondary school at St Augustine's College before going to university and completing an undergraduate degree in medical science at the University of Sydney followed by a graduate degree in medicine, which he finalised in 2004, passing with honours. Rochford lives an active lifestyle and enjoys playing many different sports such as swimming, skiing, basketball and golf in his spare time. Media career=Television In 2004, Rochford and Jamie Nicholson, his girlfriend at that time, entered a competition to be a part of the Australian television show The Block. They were accepted as a reserve in the event of a departure by any other couple. Two other contestants were forced to depart after one of the couple was found to have spent six months in jail during 2002 after conviction for a drug-related offence. Rochford and his partner then went on to win the show, which included as prize money A$100,000 plus any extra money that could be won after the auction of the property they had renovated. Following that auction, the apartment they renovated sold for $868,000 which meant that the couple pocketed the extra $78,000 above the reserve price. Rochford's profile was so increased by his time on The Block that shortly after his win he was offered a position with the What's Good For You team and joined the television program in 2006. The program was hosted by Sigrid Thornton. Specifically, Rochford's task was in part to report on certain medical myths and to be a medical \\"guinea-pig\\", testing out the fact or fallacy of the underpinning suggestion of the myth. For example, he was stung by a jellyfish to see what method best relieved the pain; ate 15 kilograms (33 lb) of carrots to see if that consumption would improve his eyesight. In addition to his role as a \\"guinea pig\\", he also has undertaken more serious roles. For example, he reported on the concentration of pathogens in various meats and related those facts to a better understanding of how to cook those meats. Rochford has also been on game shows such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, Temptation as a guest playing for charity. He has hosted a number Nine Network shows including Amazing Medical Stories, What's Good For You and Random Acts of Kindness. In 2010, Rochford joined Network Ten's The Project as a regular guest panelist. He also filled in for co-host Charlie Pickering on the show . He was a regular guest panelist on The Circle and had a cameo appearance in an episode of Offspring. On 18 August 2011, it was announced that Rochford would be a co-host of Network Ten's new breakfast show Breakfast. However he left the program on 29 June 2012. In 2013, Rochford joined The Living Room as resident health expert. In addition he also appeared during the last half-hour of morning TV program Studio 10 on Tuesday and Thursday mornings to discuss medical issues. In June 2014, Rochford joined the Seven Network as the network's National Medical Editor, after leaving Network Ten the week earlier. He will appear on various Seven programs In 2018, it was announced that Rochford alongside Mark Humphries would host the Australian version of Pointless on Network Ten. Radio On 4 January 2011, Claire Hooper and Rochford formed a new breakfast show on radio station Mix 106.5 called The Brighter Side of Breakfast. On 18 August 2011 that Rochford left Mix 106.5 to co-host Network Ten's breakfast show Breakfast.

As HMS Juno, she carried out the historic role in 1857 of annexing the Cocos (Keeling) Islands to the British Empire. She was renamed HMS Mariner in January 1878 and then HMS Atalanta two weeks later.  Disappearance  Atalanta was serving as a training ship when in 1880 she disappeared with her entire crew after setting sail from Bermuda for Falmouth, England on 31 January 1880. It was presumed that she sank in a powerful storm which crossed her route a couple of weeks after she sailed. The search for evidence of her fate attracted worldwide attention, and the Admiralty received more than 150 telegrams and 200 personal calls from anxious friends and relatives after it was announced that the ship was missing, and possibly lost.The Times, 15 April 1880. Investigation of the ship's loss was rendered difficult by the lack of any survivors, but one former member of her crew, Able Seaman John Varling, testified that he had found her \\"exceedingly crank, as being overweight.. She rolled 32 degrees, and Captain Stirling is reported as having been heard to remark that had she rolled one degree more she must have gone over and foundered. The young sailors were either too timid to go aloft or were incapacitated by sea-sickness... Varling states that they hid themselves away, and could not be found when wanted by the boatswain's mate.\\" The Times, 27 April 1880. A Royal Navy service record from the last completed training mission before Atalantas loss The exact circumstances of the ship's loss remain uncertain, but the gunboat ‚Äî which arrived at Portsmouth on 19 April from the Chile station ‚Äî reported \\"that at the Azores she noticed immense quantities of wreckage floating about... in fact the sea was strewn with spars etc.\\" The Times, 20 April 1880. Two days later, amid mounting concern that the loss of the ship might have been prevented had her crew not been so inexperienced, The Times editorialised: \\"There can be no question of the criminal folly of sending some 300 lads who have never been to sea before in a training ship without a sufficient number of trained an experienced seamen to take charge of her in exceptional circumstances. The ship's company of the Atalanta numbered only about 11 able seamen, and when we consider that young lads are often afraid to go aloft in a gale to take down sail... a special danger attaching to the Atalanta becomes apparent.\\"The Times, 21 April 1880. A memorial in St Ann's Church, Portsmouth, names a total of 281 fatalities in the disaster. Among those lost was Philip Fisher, a lieutenant who had enlisted the indirect support of Queen Victoria to obtain an appointment to the ship.Mackay, Ruddock (1973). Fisher of Kilverstone.

A blood-member of the Riario family, and of the Salviati family (to whom Pope Sixtus IV had re-awarded the papal banking contract after taking it away from the Medici), he was also related by marriage to the Pazzi, Medici, Vettori, and other powerful families. Orphaned at a young age, Salviati was educated as a humanist but vied to succeed in the church, knowing he could not rise to power in the family after losing his father. Pro-Medici sources paint Salviati as a flatterer and gambler who lusted for the power that could be attained through church favour. In 1464, Salviati moved to Rome to attach himself to Francesco della Rovere ‚Äì who later became Pope Sixtus IV ‚Äì and his nephews, Girolamo and Pietro Riario. This paid off in his appointment as archbishop. The Medici family of Florence opposed his appointment as archbishop and so in spring 1478, he sent to Florence his nephew Raffaele Riario to lure both Lorenzo and Giuliano to the Duomo for assassination in the Pazzi conspiracy, and invited him to a mass at the Duomo at which the assassination would take place. When the bell that was rung during the elevation rang, Salviati was to go to the Palazzo Vecchio, kill the Gonfaloniere Petrucci and take possession of the Palazzo della Signoria, whilst the main killing occurred in the cathedral, but on arriving there he was arrested by Petrucci and within an hour had been hanged by a lynch mob from the window of the Sala dei Duecento. Salviati's death at the hands of the Florentines was a key factor behind the interdict placed upon Florence and the ensuing two years war with the Papacy. In popular culture In Assassin's Creed II, which contains a fictional version of the conspiracy, Salviati had merely led Pazzi-allied troops into Florence and was able to flee to his villa in the Tuscan countryside (an unfortunate farmer being hanged in his place), only to be hunted down and slain in 1479 by the assassin Ezio Auditore. He appears in the second season of Medici: Masters of Florence, played by Jacob Fortune-Lloyd.

When Severson sold Surfer in the late 1960s to For Better Living, the magazine had around 100,000 readers. The magazine changed ownership and management numerous times over its history. American Media (AMI) purchased the magazine in 2019 from TEN: Publishing, a division of Adventure Sports Network (ASN). The magazine's last editor-in-chief was Todd Prodanovich and its photo editor was Grant Ellis. Background John Severson created Surfer to counter the depiction of the sport and surf culture in the 1959 film Gidget. In his 2014 book John Severson Surf, he wrote \\"surfers hated those Hollywood surf films, and I could see that Surfer could create a truer image of the sport.\\" Severson's photography, art and humor set the tone for the future of Surfer, which quickly grew to reflect the sport and the culture, as well as become a voice for surfers and environmental activism. Severson sold Surfer, the date reported variously as \\"in 1970;\\" alternately \\"in 1971\\" directly to Steve Pezman; and also alternately \\"in the late 1960s\\" to For Better Living, an Auburn, California-based company founded by F.G. 'Bud' Fabian. Bud Fabian had retired from For Better Living in 1996, a company whose primary business was precast concrete. At the time, the magazine was produced by Surfer Publications, a subsidiary of For Better Living and at least the late 1990s, was based in San Juan Capistrano. Drew Kampion was editor of the magazine from 1968 to 1972. Noted writer and surf historian Matt Warshaw, became a writer for Surfer, beginning in 1984, becoming the publication's editor in 1990. At Surfer, Warshaw mentored numerous journalists, giving them a place on the editorial staff and connecting independent authors with editors and surfing personalities. In 2019, when asked about 2019 purchase of Surfer by American Media (AMI), widely known for its National Enquirer publication, Warshaw said, \\"Surfer, best-case scenario, is in for a very rough year or two, then American Media puts it up for sale and it gets bought as a vanity project, the way Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post. Surfer will at that point be reborn in whatever form the rich benefactor dictates.\\" Editor Todd Prodanovich and the other four full-time staffers were furloughed October 2, 2020 and publication was halted.

The genus has a widespread distribution and, according to a 2008 estimate, contains 18 species. They belong to the family Phallaceae in the order Phallales. The best known species (and type species) is the common stinkhorn (Phallus impudicus). History and taxonomy Hadrianus Junius, drawn by Theodor de Bry The genus was first mentioned in the literature by the Dutch botanist Hadrianus Junius (1511‚Äì1575), who, in 1564 wrote a short book published in Delft on the Phallus in Hollandia, describing a mushroom in the form of a penis. He was not convinced that the organism was fungal in nature: > ... I am not sure that our Phallus falls within the class of the fungi. I > will not definitely decide to place it there because I do not want to make a > judgment before others who know more about the matter. The lightness, > however, and looseness of the substance and (a necessary condition for the > existence of sponges) the sour sap of the moist earth where it was born, all > bear witness that it belongs to the family of the fungi. However, the folds > and creases, which do not exist here, but do among fungi, bear witness > against it. There is also no trace of the cap that is normally connected to > the stalk. Here the hat takes the place of the cap, and it can be removed > without damage. Moreover, the site where it lives also argues against it, > because this plant can only be found in dunes, and only there where old > marram grass grows. Fungi, on the other hand, as stated clearly by authors, > live in swampy, dirty, and rotting moist places, such as close to the roots > of oak trees. In 1753, Carl Linnaeus used the genus name Phallus in his Species Plantarum; the named was later sanctioned by Christian Hendrik Persoon when he used it in his 1801 Synopsis Methodica Fungorum. Some authors have considered the presence of an indusium (a lacy \\"skirt\\" that hangs beneath the cap) to be an important taxonomic characteristic, and have placed taxa with indusia in a separate genus Dictyophora. More recent publications suggest that there are close morphological similarities in Phallus species with and without an indusium, so the trend has been to merge Dictyophora into Phallus; the online taxonomic databases Index Fungorum and MycoBank consider Dictyophora synonymous with Phallus. Diversity According to the German mycologist Hanns Kreisel, who surveyed the genus in 1996, there are 33 species. Of these, 3 species are limited to the New World, 18 to the Old World, and another are 10 found in both hemispheres. His treatment divides the genus into five subgenera: Aporophallus; Itajahya; Endophallus; Satyrus; and Phallus. Spanish mycologist Francisco D. Calonge recognized 25 species in 2005, while according to the Dictionary of the Fungi (10th ed, 2008), there are 18 species. Recently proposed species (not accounted for by these publications) include P. maderensis (2008), P. luteus (2009), P. drewesii (2009), and P. calongei (2009). Description The immature fruit bodies of Phallus species grow underground, are roughly spherical to ovoid, and have a soft or gelatinous surface. Conspicuous white rhizomorphs extend from the base of this structure and help to anchor it in the soil. The outer tissue layer, or peridium, is white to pale, smooth, firm-membranous. The slimy spore mass, or gleba, is attached to outer surface of the cap, and is colored dark olivaceous to blackish brown. The stalks of Phallus mushrooms are called receptacles: they are upright, cylindrical, hollow, spongy, and bearing roughly bell-shaped cap with irregularly branching ridges on the outer surface. Some species have an indusium, a net-like structure that extends from the cap to the ground. The gleba is slimy and pale greenish-yellow; in several species the gleba has a foul, carrion-like odor, which attracts insects that then help disperse the spores. Mosquitoes, however, that feed on the gleba are killed, suggesting the fungus may contain compounds that could be used as an attractant or biocontrol agent. The spores of Phallus species are small, ellipsoid, and somewhat translucent (hyaline). The spores of various Phallaceae species, including P. ravenelii has been shown to be smooth and featureless using scanning electron microscopy. Roughened spore surfaces are considered by some mycologists to be an adaptation that results in friction during travel in the air, and increase dispersal distances. Phallus spores are not airborne at any time in their life cycle. Nigerian folklore The Yoruba people of Nigeria call stinkhorn mushrooms Akufodewa, a combination of the words ku (die), fun (for), ode (hunter), and a (search). The Yoruban name reflects the belief that hunters, smelling the glebal odor in the forest, may mistake the smell for a dead animal and search for it. Phallus mushrooms are also used by the Yoruba to prepare a charm known as Egbe, which reputedly \\"has the power of making one invisible in the face of danger.\\" Stinkhorns are also used by the Urhobo and Ibibio people of southeastern Nigeria to prepare \\"harmful charms\\". They associate the fungus with the millipede, as is reflected in their names for the mushrooms: the Urhobo call it Uwovwi-rerivwi, from the Urhobo Uwivwi (house), re (of), rivwe (millipede); the Ibido name is Efoketim, from the Ibidio efok (house) and etim (millipede). The ·ª§kw·ª•√†n√¨ of Asaba, who associate the stinkhorns with death because of their smell, use the fungus to prepare \\"harmful charms and charms which confer immunity against evil attacks.\\" They call the mushrooms Oga-egungun, from the ·ª§kw·ª•√†n√¨ oga (net or fence) and egungun (dead person). Habitat Phallus hadriani Phallus mushrooms are found amongst leaf litter in damp woodland with the rhizomorphs attached to buried wood. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, but with richer species diversity in tropical regions.

It is licensed to the city of Wagga Wagga, New South Wales. The station is the first radio station to have a radio receiver built in regional New South Wales and was originally owned by a husband and wife team, the late Eric and Nan Roberts, who were both formerly school teachers in Narrandera. It officially commenced broadcasts from the former Hardys' Building in Fitzmaurice Street overlooking the Wollundry Lagoon, broadcasting on the Oura Road Transmitter site with 2,000 watts on 29 June 1932 and operated between 6.00 am and 11.00 pm. In 1995 2WZD (FM93) began broadcasting. In 1998 DMG Radio Australia bought both 2WG and FM93 (now Triple M 1152 and Hit 93.1). In late 2004 the stations were bought by Macquarie Regional RadioWorks who currently own and operate the stations. The station including its sister station (93.1 StarFM, now Hit 93.1) was originally located in Fitzmaurice Street but was moved to the former Prime7 Television Centre in the suburb of Kooringal on 6 June 2000. 2WG relocated to its new Forsyth Street studios on 6 October 2015. 2WG was rebranded as Triple M Riverina 1152 as part of Southern Cross Austereo's Australia wide rebranding in December 2016. Notable people Bill Kerr, who grew up in Wagga Wagga and would go on to stardom in British radio, the West End stage, and Australian film, served as a 2WG announcer as a teenager, from 1939‚Äì1941.

It can be used to determine the fraction of liquid and solid phases for a given binary composition and temperature that is between the liquidus and solidus line. In an alloy or a mixture with two phases, Œ± and Œ≤, which themselves contain two elements, A and B, the lever rule states that the mass fraction of the Œ± phase is :w^\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{w_{\\\\rm B}-w_{\\\\rm B}^\\\\beta}{w_{\\\\rm B}^\\\\alpha-w_{\\\\rm B}^\\\\beta} where * w_{\\\\rm B}^\\\\alpha is the mass fraction of element B in the Œ± phase * w_{\\\\rm B}^\\\\beta is the mass fraction of element B in the Œ≤ phase * w_{\\\\rm B} is the mass fraction of element B in the entire alloy or mixture all at some fixed temperature or pressure.  Derivation  Suppose an alloy at an equilibrium temperature T consists of w_{\\\\rm B} mass fraction of element B. Suppose also that at temperature T the alloy consists of two phases, Œ± and Œ≤, for which the Œ± consists of w_{\\\\rm B}^\\\\alpha, and Œ≤ consists of w_{\\\\rm B}^\\\\beta. Let the mass of the Œ± phase in the alloy be m_\\\\alpha so that the mass of the Œ≤ phase is m^\\\\beta = m - m^\\\\alpha, where m is the total mass of the alloy. By definition, then, the mass of element B in the Œ± phase is m_{\\\\rm B}^\\\\alpha = w_{\\\\rm B}^\\\\alpha m^\\\\alpha, while the mass of element B in the Œ≤ phase is m_{\\\\rm B}^\\\\beta = w_{\\\\rm B}^\\\\beta \\\\left(m -m^\\\\alpha\\\\right). Together these two quantities sum to the total mass of element B in the alloy, which is given by m_{\\\\rm B} = w_{\\\\rm B}m. Therefore, : w_{\\\\rm B}m = m_{\\\\rm B} = m_{\\\\rm B}^\\\\alpha + m_{\\\\rm B}^\\\\beta = w_{\\\\rm B}^\\\\alpha m^\\\\alpha + w_{\\\\rm B}^\\\\beta \\\\left(m - m^\\\\alpha\\\\right) By rearranging, one finds that :w^\\\\alpha \\\\equiv \\\\frac{m^\\\\alpha}{m} = \\\\frac{ w_{\\\\rm B}-w_{\\\\rm B}^{\\\\beta} }{ w_{\\\\rm B}^{\\\\alpha}-w_{\\\\rm B}^{\\\\beta} } This final fraction is the mass fraction of the Œ± phase in the alloy. Calculations A phase diagram with tie line (LS) for a binary isomorphous system. The x dimension defines the mass fraction of elements A and B. Binary phase diagrams Before any calculations can be made, a tie line is drawn on the phase diagram to determine the mass fraction of each element; on the phase diagram to the right it is line segment LS. This tie line is drawn horizontally at the composition's temperature from one phase to another (here the liquid to the solid). The mass fraction of element B at the liquidus is given by wBl (represented as wl in this diagram) and the mass fraction of element B at the solidus is given by wBs (represented as ws in this diagram). The mass fraction of solid and liquid can then be calculated using the following lever rule equations: :w^{\\\\rm s} = \\\\frac{w_{\\\\rm B} - w_{\\\\rm B}^{\\\\rm l}}{w_{\\\\rm B}^{\\\\rm s} - w_{\\\\rm B}^{\\\\rm l}} :w^{\\\\rm l} = \\\\frac{w_{\\\\rm B}^{\\\\rm s} - w_{\\\\rm B}}{w_{\\\\rm B}^{\\\\rm s} - w_{\\\\rm B}^{\\\\rm l}} where wB is the mass fraction of element B for the given composition (represented as wo in this diagram). The numerator of each equation is the original composition that we are interested in is +/- the opposite lever arm. That is if you want the mass fraction of solid then take the difference between the liquid composition and the original composition. And then the denominator is the overall length of the arm so the difference between the solid and liquid compositions. If you're having difficulty realising why this is so, try visualising the composition when wo approaches wl. Then the liquid concentration will start increasing. Eutectic phase diagrams Tie line in the Alpha plus Liquid two phase region There is now more than one two-phase region. The tie line drawn is from the solid alpha to the liquid and by dropping a vertical line down at these points the mass fraction of each phase is directly read off the graph, that is the mass fraction in the x axis element. The same equations can be used to find the mass fraction of alloy in each of the phases, i.e. wl is the mass fraction of the whole sample in the liquid phase.

In addition to full texts, a text publication society may publish translations, calendars and indexes. Members of the society (private individuals or institutions) pay an annual subscription, in return for which they either automatically receive a copy of each volume as it is published, or (as in the case of, for example, the Royal Historical Society) are eligible to purchase volumes at favourable members' rates. Some societies attempt to keep to a regular cycle of publishing (generally one volume per year, as in the case of the London Record Society and the Canterbury and York Society: the Royal Historical Society, exceptionally, aims for two volumes per year). Others, however, publish on an irregular and occasional basis, as the completion of editorial work allows. Volumes are usually also made available for sale to non-members, but the price is invariably higher than that paid (either as the retail price or through subscriptions) by members, thereby establishing an incentive for interested parties to join. The model originated and is most commonly found in the United Kingdom, but has also been adopted in other countries. In the 19th century, when many of the societies were founded, they were sometimes known as book clubs. They have also been termed printing clubs.Levine 1986, pp. 16, 40-45, 178-9. Those that publish exclusively archival material are often known as record societies or records societies. Historical development The principle of subscription publishing ‚Äì that is, of funding the publication of a volume by securing multiple advance subscriptions from individuals interested in buying the final product ‚Äì was first established in the 17th century, and routinely adopted during the 18th. The idea of extending the model to the membership of a society was initiated by the Roxburghe Club, founded in 1812 as a convivial association of bibliophiles, but which rapidly introduced the principle that each member should sponsor the publication of an edition of a rare work of interest to members, and that other volumes would be published by the Club collectively. In both cases, the volumes were intended for distribution to the entire membership. The Club's first publication, donated by Sir William Bolland and issued in 1814, was the Earl of Surrey's translation of parts of Virgil's Aeneid, originally printed in 1557. One early Roxburghe Club member (from 1822) was Sir Walter Scott, who was inspired by it to establish the Bannatyne Club to print works of interest for Scottish tradition, literature, and history. Other special-interest societies followed. In contrast to the exclusive Roxburghe Club (which had an elite membership and issued its publications as luxurious limited editions), most had broad membership criteria, and had as their primary objective the dissemination of valuable historical texts as widely as possible.Levine 1986, pp. 14‚Äì15. Nevertheless, their activities tended to appeal to the \\"monied and educated\\" classes: in 1838, 20% of the Camden Society's members were clergymen, 9% held legal qualifications, and 36% were Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries.Levine 1986, pp. 43‚Äì4. Success being dependent on fund-raising and the attraction of new members, the early societies often suffered from financial and organisational troubles. Controversy followed Frederick James Furnivall, a prime mover in many of the early ventures. In the second half of the 19th century the government-sponsored Rolls Series took over some of the territories of the amateur societies, particularly in respect of the publication of chronicles.Levine 1986, p. 45. The productions of several of the early societies included literary texts, but by the end of the 19th century, the majority of societies were tending to focus instead on the publication of archival records. This continued to be the pattern in the 20th century. The Durham-based Surtees Society, founded in 1834 and modelled in part on the Scottish Bannatyne and Maitland Clubs,Levine 1986, p. 41. was the first English society to adopt a specifically regional remit, in its case the elucidation of the history of the area constituting the ancient kingdom of Northumbria. Its establishment was deeply rooted in local pride: in an early prospectus, James Raine (its principal founder and first secretary) drew attention to just a few unpublished manuscripts of Durham interest, \\"which, in these times, few individuals would incur the risk of printing at their own cost; but which nevertheless, afford even singly, how much more collectively, the most valuable materials to those who are anxious to study rightly the History of our forefathers under its different characters\\". The Chetham Society, founded in 1843, concerned itself in much the same way with the counties of Lancashire and Cheshire. From the 1880s onwards, many societies focused on a single county. A particularly energetic advocate was W. P. W. Phillimore, who was active in the foundation of the British Record Society, Scottish Record Society, Thoroton Society, Canterbury and York Society, and Irish Record Society. Several county archaeological and historical societies undertook text publication as just one among a broader range of activities, and in certain cases ‚Äì for example, the Yorkshire Archaeological and Historical Society and the Kent Archaeological Society ‚Äì continue to do so. In other cases, a new society has broken away from its parent archaeological society to become an independent body dedicated solely to text publication: examples include the Surrey Record Society and the Wiltshire Record Society.

Consumer advantage  Consumers can choose services adapted to their need, this becomes specifically interesting in modern type broadband networks where traditional \\"laptop\\" access is mixed with smaller hand held devices targeting for example voice services.  Challenges  Implementing service-oriented provisioning requires the network operator to re-engineer the way services are created and distributed into a network. This re-engineering is a result of extensive usage of profile-oriented provisioning which technically is similar to service-oriented provisioning except that a profiles based approach does not scale properly. In a profile-oriented system the number of required profiles grows exponentially with the number of services provided by a network. In a service-oriented system the number of required \\"profiles\\" grows linearly.

It is one of the four former parishes of Murray County which became part of the ACT, along with Yarrolumla, Narrabundah and Gigerline.

It was bounded to the south by the Molonglo River (now Lake Burley Griffin), while on the west the boundary was on the western side of Black Mountain, and on the east the boundary was on the eastern side of Mount Ainslie, thus including both mountains. It went as far north as Gungahlin. The boundary to the east ran between Mount Ainslie and Mount Majura, so it did not include Mount Majura. References *Parish of Canberra, County of Murray.

Mostly considered an anti-drug film, it was made for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The film follows its protagonist, Donny B, a young black man who appears to be a heroin addict, as he makes his way through the cruel ghettos of New York City. He tries to score money for his next fix by stealing hubcaps, purse-snatching, panhandling, and engaging in street gambling. The short film's soundtrack mostly consists of voice-overs of his parents despairing over his future, former addicts describing the junkie lifestyle, and cops informing the audience of the consequences of illegal drug use and addiction. Through the run time of 14 minutes, a blues-like tune written and performed by Harry Holt plays over the footage and voice-overs, with vocals that come in and out during the film, narrating Donny B as he does wrong. DVD release Film preservation company Terpsichore Collection Inc. was reportedly in talks to restore the film for a special edition DVD which would contain other important or rare short films.

The group moved to Europe in 1969, living in Germany, and performing in Germany, the Netherlands and France until 1974 when the band split up. Initially, some members stayed in Europe, some went to India, but most of the band returned to the United States. Although originating in the U.S., Sweet Smoke is often referred to as a Krautrock band.Encyclopedia of Krautrock, Kosmische Musik Noted for their buoyant rhythms, inventive improvisations and complex musical structures, in interviews, the group says their music was influenced by Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, John Coltrane and The Beatles. History After their first performances in the U.S. and the Caribbean, the group moved to Germany and formed a commune in a farm house in the village of H√ºthum, outside the city of Emmerich, about a kilometer (0.62 miles) from the border with the Netherlands. The group became well known in the region on and off the stage for their mixture of spirited musical performances combined with their interests in Eastern and Psychedelic philosophies.From Now to Now, the Autobiography of Marlis Jermutus The original members when they arrived in Germany were Andy Dershin (bass guitar), Michael Fontana (tenor saxophone, alto recorder, vocals, percussion), Jay Dorfman (drums, percussion), Marvin Kaminowitz (lead guitar, vocals) and Victor Sacco (guitar). Victor would soon be replaced by Steve Rosenstein (rhythm guitar, vocals). In 1970 the group was approached by EMI, and they recorded their first LP, Just a Poke with German record producer Konrad \\"Conny‚Äù Plank. Sweet Smoke in 1974 with their Ford Transit van (from left to right: John, Rick, Andy, Enid, Marvin, Marty, Howie, Diane) After recording Just a Poke, Sweet Smoke took a year off to travel. Most of the group drove the band‚Äôs Ford Transit van overland to India for a spiritual journey in connection with the socio-spiritual group Ananda Marga. The group first learned of the success of Just a Poke, after meeting German tourists in Nepal. They returned to Europe, signed a new recording contract with EMI, and added Jeffrey Dershin (piano, percussion, vocals) as a full-time member. The group recorded their second LP Darkness to Light at EMI studios in the Netherlands in 1973. Later in 1973, Jeffery Dershin returned home to assume his role as a father, Michael Fontana left the group to return to India, and Steve Rosenstein was replaced by Rick Greenberg, aka Rick Rasa (rhythm guitar, sitar, vocals). Near the end of 1974, the group broke up for the final time. They played their last performance in the concert hall of the music conservatory Hochschule f√ºr Musik in Berlin. The concert was recorded by EMI and became the group‚Äôs last LP, Sweet Smoke Live.

A study conducted by Boeing found that 55% of airline accidents between 1959 and 2005 were caused by such human related factors, while only 17% of accidents were caused by mechanical issues with the aircraft. The Tenerife airport disaster, the worst accident in aviation history, is a prime example of an accident in which a chain of events and errors can be identified leading up to the crash. Pilot error, communications problems, fog, and airfield congestion (due to a bomb threat and explosion at another airport) all contributed to this catastrophe.

Here, the switching of network packets occurs at a lower level, namely the data link layer rather than the traditional network layer. Each packet is assigned a label number and the switching takes place after examination of the label assigned to each packet. The switching is much faster than IP-routing. New technologies such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) use label switching. The established ATM protocol also uses label switching at its core. According to RFC 2475 (An Architecture for Differentiated Services, December 1998): \\"Examples of the label switching (or virtual circuit) model include Frame Relay, ATM, and MPLS. In this model path forwarding state and traffic management or Quality of Service (QoS) state is established for traffic streams on each hop along a network path. Traffic aggregates of varying granularity are associated with a label switched path at an ingress node, and packets/cells within each label switched path are marked with a forwarding label that is used to look up the next-hop node, the per-hop forwarding behavior, and the replacement label at each hop. This model permits finer granularity resource allocation to traffic streams, since label values are not globally significant but are only significant on a single link; therefore resources can be reserved for the aggregate of packets/cells received on a link with a particular label, and the label switching semantics govern the next-hop selection, allowing a traffic stream to follow a specially engineered path through the network.\\" A related topic is \\"Multilayer Switching,\\" which discusses silicon-based wire- speed routing devices that examine not only layer 3 packet information, but also layer 4 (transport) and layer 7 (application) information.

The combination of Healey, Thorold Merrett and Bill Twomey, Jr., gave Collingwood a lethal centre line. Healey was a great mark for his size and dazzled the crowd with his evasive ground work and polished skills. He always had great control of the ball and was the master of the pinpoint pass. Healey was one of the heroes of Collingwood's 1953 Premiership victory and was rated by many as one of the best players on the ground that day. He won All-Australian selection in the same year. Essendon's great full-forward John Coleman once named Healey as the best wingman he had ever seen. \\"He is clever, has that wonderful tenacity of all good Collingwood players, and is tireless\\". Healey is perhaps best known for his last moments as a League footballer. In the 1955 grand final Healey had a sickening collision with Melbourne's Frank 'Bluey' Adams. They were both stretchered off, with Healey's nose broken in five places and his skull fractured.

She was subsequently appointed to the Cabinet of Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry as Minister for Women, Culture, and Social Welfare.http://www.fijihosting.com/pcgov/cabinet.htm Along with many other parliamentarians, she was kidnapped by gunmen led by George Speight and held hostage at the parliamentary complex during the civilian coup d'√©tat of 2000. Padarath lost her seat in the House of Representatives in the general election of 2001, and failed to regain it in the 2006 election, but was appointed to the Senate as one of nine nominees of the Leader of the Opposition. She served in the Senate until it was closed one day after the military coup of 5 December 2006. Personal life Padarath, an indigenous Fijian, was married to an Indo-Fijian. Her son, Ben Padarath, also contested the 2006 election, but as a candidate of the National Alliance Party of Fiji. Padarath publicly criticized her son for saying that political power should remain in indigenous Fijian hands, saying that such comments were racist and contrary to the way he had been brought up.  Death  On 14 July 2019, Padarath died at the age of 74. Her son announced that she died after a short illness.

The seaweed is commonly found around the west coast of Great Britain and east coast of Ireland along the Irish Sea, where it is known as slake. It is smooth in texture and forms delicate, sheetlike thalli, often clinging to rocks. The principal variety is Porphyra umbilicalis. Porphyra (laver seaweed) is classified as red algae; it tends to be a brownish colour, but boils down to a dark green pulp when prepared. Laver seaweed has a high content of dietary minerals, particularly iodine and iron. The high iodine content gives the seaweed a distinctive flavour in common with olives and oysters. Laver seaweed has been cultivated as a food since at least the 17th century. It is prepared by washing repeatedly and then boiled until it becomes a soft mush when it is known as laverbread. The gelatinous paste that results can then be sold as it is, or rolled in oatmeal; it is sometimes coated with oatmeal prior to frying. Laverbread is traditionally eaten fried with bacon and cockles as part of a Welsh breakfast, or with hog's pudding in the south west of England. Cultivation Cultivation of laver seaweed as food is thought to be very ancient, though the first mention was in William Camden's Britannia in the early 17th century. It is plucked from the rocks and given a preliminary rinse in clear water. The collected laver seaweed is repeatedly washed to remove sand and boiled for hours until it becomes a stiff, green mush. In this state, the seaweed can be preserved for about a week. Typically during the 18th century, the mush was packed into a crock and sold as \\"potted laver\\". Laver seaweed cultivation is typically associated with Wales, and it is still gathered off the Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire coasts, although similar farming methods are used at the west coast of Scotland. Laverbread can be eaten cold as a salad with lamb or mutton. A simple preparation is to heat the laverbread and to add butter and the juice of a lemon or Seville orange. Laverbread can be heated and served with boiled bacon. The alga The seaweed Porphyra umbilicalis which is used to make laverbread Laverbread is made from the seaweed Porphyra umbilicalis from the genus Porphyra and family bangiaceae. The seaweed is commonly found around the west coast of Great Britain and east coast of Ireland along the Irish Sea, where it is also known as slake. It is smooth in texture and forms delicate, sheetlike thalli, often clinging to rocks. Porphyra is classified as red algae; it tends to be a brownish colour, but boils down to a dark green pulp when prepared. It is unusual amongst seaweeds because the fronds are only one cell thick.Wells, Emma (2010), A Field Guide to the British Seaweeds, National Marine Biological Analytical Quality Control Scheme (p 24) . Laver has a high content of dietary minerals, particularly iodine and iron. The high iodine content gives the seaweed a distinctive flavour in common with olives and oysters. Preparation Laverbread ( or ') is a traditional Welsh delicacy made from laver seaweed. To make laverbread, the seaweed is boiled for several hours, then minced or pureed. The gelatinous paste that results can then be sold as it is, or rolled in oatmeal; it is sometimes coated with oatmeal prior to frying. Laverbread is traditionally eaten fried with bacon and cockles as part of a Welsh breakfast. It can also be used to make a sauce to accompany lamb, crab, monkfish, etc., and to make laver soup ('). Richard Burton has been quoted as describing laverbread as \\"Welshman's caviar\\". Laver seaweed is often associated with Penclawdd and its cockles, being used traditionally in the Welsh diet and is still eaten widely across Wales in the form of laverbread. In addition to Wales, laverbread is eaten across the Bristol Channel in North Devon, especially the Exmoor coast around Lynmouth, Combe Martin and Ilfracombe. In North Devon it is generally not cooked with oatmeal and is simply referred to as 'laver' (lay-ver). Laverbread is highly nutritious because of its high proportions of protein, iron, and especially iodine. It also contains high levels of vitamins B2, A, D and C.

It is one of the four former parishes of Murray County which became part of the ACT, along with Yarrolumla, Canberra and Gigerline. While other parishes lost land to the ACT, these were the only ones to lose all of the land within the parish. It was bounded by the Molonglo River (now Lake Burley Griffin) to the north, and includes most of present-day South Canberra, Weston Creek and Woden including Parliament House, although not the suburb of Narrabundah, which has the same name, but was actually in Queanbeyan parish. The border to the north-east was approximately where Barton is, near Kings Avenue bridge. The eastern boundary was from this point south to just east of Mount Mugga Mugga. The southern boundary of the parish was just south of Mount Taylor, and it included the mountain itself. The southern boundary was also just north of Wanniassa. The south-western tip of the parish was near, but not including, Mount Forster. References * Map showing proposed Federal Capital Territory and tenures of land within same, Charles Robt.
