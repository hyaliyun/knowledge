It is believed to date from 30 September 2004 and raised uncertainty over whether Lowry had misled the Moriarty Tribunal which had previously investigated him. Much of the controversy focused on the following comments by Lowry: Journalist Michael Clifford, writing in the Irish Examiner, drew comparisons between the response - or lack thereof - from the Irish government and the British government's past responses to tamer crimes such as Jeffrey Archer's perjury and Chris Huhne's perverting the course of justice. Clifford wrote that the Lowry scandal \\"tells us much about what passes for democracy in this State. [It] involves prima facie evidence that at least one crime may have been committed by serving TD and former government minister, Michael Lowry. In a proper democracy [...] this would be a matter for the police.\\" The Sunday Independent published a transcript of the Lowry Tapes; however state broadcaster RT√â's coverage was roundly criticised and deemed inadequate. The Sunday Independent said RT√â's self-censorship had become the story and The Sunday Times featured a piece captioned \\"Our state broadcaster must learn to confront, not cower.\\" One of the few mentions was provided by Marian Finucane, one of RT√â's highest earners, who brushed over the Lowry Tapes in two minutes at the end of her show when one of her panelists brought up the topic. Morning Ireland preferred to focus its political coverage on what were termed more trivial topics, such as Luke 'Ming' Flanagan's driving technique and tweets by Gerry Adams. On 14 March 2013, the Lowry Tapes were broadcast in full on national television, on the TV3 programme Tonight with Vincent Browne.

Rhoades, ca. 1915 Katharine Nash Rhoades, born November 30, 1885, was the daughter of Lyman Rhoades (1847‚Äì1907), a banker, and Elizabeth Nash (1856-1919) of New York City. She was the middle child, with two brothers, Lyman Nash and Stephen Nash Rhoades. She attended the Veltin School for Girls in Manhattan. Rhoades was a debutante in 1904, as was Malvina Hoffman, with whom she traveled with Marion H. Beckett to Paris in 1908. She studied art there for two years. She studied with Robert Henri. Career Katharine Rhoades, Mary Steichen, ca. 1915 Rhoades was one of the artists who exhibited at the landmark 1913 International Exhibition of Modern Art show. The show included one of her oil paintings, Talloires, ($400).Brown, Milton W., ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Story of the Armory Show‚Äô‚Äô, The Joseph H. Hirshhorn Foundation, 1963, p. 284 She, along with Agnes Ernst Meyer and Marion Beckett were known as \\"the Three Graces\\" of the Alfred Stieglitz art circle. They were models for photographs by Stieglitz and Edward Steichen, paintings by Steichen, caricatures by Francis Picabia, drawings by Marius de Zayas, and paintings by Arthur Beecher Carles. Marsden Hartley remembered Rhoades and Beckett as being ‚Äúboth six feet, beautiful and always together‚Äú. She posed for photographs by Stieglitz beginning in 1914. Rhoades was a contributed poems and illustrations to Camera Work a quarterly journal published by Alfred Stieglitz, like poems that were published in 1914. She was also an editor and contributor to 291, an arts and literary magazine. For the \\"What '291' Means to Me\\" issue, she wrote, \\"I touch four walls‚ÄîI hear voices... those who have touched its world‚ÄîI too went gazing, questioning, answering... I too merged with the voices; and the walls echoed\\". Katharine Rhoades, Standing Nude, ca. 1915 In 1914, Rhoades and Beckett exhibited the modern works of art at the National Arts Club. The following year, the two women had a joint exhibition at Stieglitz's 291 Gallery. She had her first exhibit of her avante-garde paintings at the gallery that year. Her paintings were similar to the works of Matisse before World War I. She burned many of her paintings made before the 1920s, her work during that time had elements of Cubism. She contributed to the formation of the Dada movement. Rhoades, who was Charles Freer's secretary about 1913, was named as a lifetime trustee of the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in his will. The other trustees were Agnes and Eugene Meyer. The gallery opened in 1923. The Meyers named their daughter, Katharine, the wife of Philip Graham and publisher of The Washington Post after her. In 1937, she co-founded a religious library now part of the Ball duPont Library at The University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee.Petteys, Chris, ‚Äò‚ÄôDictionary of Women Artists‚Äô‚Äô, G K Hill & Co. publishers, 1985, Personal life She may have had a romantic relationship with Stieglitz, or it may have been one-sided interest on his part, before he met Georgia O'Keeffe. Rhoades and Stieglitz remained good friends, and along with other members of his circle, she stayed at Stieglitz's summer home in Lake George. O'Keeffe said that she found Rhoades to be a \\"wonderful person\\" whom she always liked and corresponded. She had an affair with Arthur Beecher Carles. Rhoades died October 26, 1965 and was buried with her parents and other family members at the Hillside Burial Grounds in Sharon, Connecticut.

He ran for the Legislative Council in 1950 but was not elected. However, he became part of the Executive Council, initially as an \\"unofficial member\\". In the Legislative Council elections of 1956, he was one of four AACR members elected, the others being Joshua Hassan, Albert Risso, and J. E. Alcantara.'Gibraltar Election' in The Times (London), issue 53643 dated 22 September 1956, p. 5 He served at first as Member or Minister for Medical Services, then as Minister for Tourism, and finally as Minister for Economic Development in successive AACR Governments until his retirement in 1984. Between 1979 and 1988 he served as Mayor of Gibraltar. In 1980, he became Commander of the Order of the British Empire in recognition for public services in Gibraltar.

A single example was built in 1925, but no production followed. Design and development Thomas-Morse Aircraft had decided to specialize in all-metal aircraft after it lost an order for 200 MB-3 fighters to Boeing, who had offered a much lower bid.Wegg 1990, p. 13. Thomas Morse's chief designer, B. Douglas Thomas produced a series of all-metal aircraft, flying the unsuccessful MB-9 fighter and MB-10 trainer in 1921, and selling two R-5 racing aircraft to the United States Army Air Service in 1922.Wegg 1990, p. 27. In 1924, Thomas-Morse flew the TM-23, a single-seat biplane fighter, which was again a failure. Despite undergoing major redesign in an attempt to improve performance and handling it failed to obtain any orders.Wegg 1990, pp. 27‚Äì28. In 1924, Thomas designed a single-engined two- seat observation aircraft, the TM-24, in a further attempt to find success with all-metal construction. In an attempt to improve maneuverability, the TM-24 had a short fuselage, with the aircraft being little longer than the single-seat TM-23. Like the TM-23, the TM-24's fuselage was covered in corrugated aluminum skin. The crew of two sat in separate tandem cockpits. The upper wing was much smaller than the lower wing, having a wingspan 5 feet shorter. The wings were braced by a single \\"N\\"-strut and an inverted \\"V\\"-strut on each side. Additional auxiliary tail surfaces were mounted on the aircraft's fin, above the main tailplane, which acted as trim tabs. The aircraft was powered by a Curtiss D12 water-cooled V12 engine driving a two- bladed propeller and cooled by radiators located in fairings in the lower wing-roots.Bowers 1971, pp. 48‚Äì49.Wagner, Ray. \\"Army Pursuits the Biplane Period, 1920-1932: Boeing XPW-8, XPW-9, PW-9, PW-9C, & TM-24, 24\\". American Combat Planes of the 20th Century. 2010. Retrieved 21 April 2013. The TM-24 flew in early 1925. It was delivered to McCook Field for testing by the Army Air Service in February that year. While testing indicated that performance was good, the aircraft's landing speed was considered too high, and its rudder was masked if the observer stood up in his cockpit to use his machine gun. The TM-24 was also considered frail by the testers. Further development was abandoned and the prototype was dismantled at McCook Field. Thomas-Morse lost $46,000 on the project.

Malcolm Ross Bow (13 July 18875 July 1982) was a Canadian medical doctor and public health officer. From 1912 to 1926 Bow served as Chief Medical Officer for Regina, Saskatchewan. From 1927 to 1952 Bow served as deputy minister of health for Alberta. Born in Vernon, Ontario, Bow graduated from Queen's University with a medical degree in 1911. He became the first medical officer of the city of Regina the next year. Bow initiated a number of important public health programs in Regina. He controlled typhoid with a sanitary system of galvanized steel buckets and a specialised \\"honeywagon\\" which he helped design. Bow also instituted a child-care program which reduced the city's rate of infant mortality. Bow was also an organizer and player for the Regina Rugby Club, predecessor of the Saskatchewan Roughriders. Bow played running back and acted as secretary and treasurer for the league. In 1927 Bow moved to Edmonton to become Alberta's deputy minister of health, a position he would hold until 1952. Bow is credited with expanding health care to remote areas of the province. In 1929 Bow requested a dangerous winter flight by bush pilot Wop May to bring diphtheria vaccine to Fort Vermilion to combat an emerging outbreak. Bow was initially criticised for the \\"foolhardy\\" risk, but the delivery was successful and the pilots were greeted as national heroes on their return to Edmonton. From 1938 until 1954 Bow combined his administrative duties with teaching public health at the University of Alberta, becoming an associate professor and then professor emeritus in 1956. In 1953 Bow moved north to become Chief Medical Officer of the Yukon. Malcolm Bow and his wife Norma had two daughters and a son, diplomat Malcolm Norman Bow. Bow died in 1982 in Edmonton.

The software uses evolutionary search to determine mathematical equations that describe sets of data in their simplest form.  Origin and Development  Since the 1970s, the primary way companies have performed data science has been to hire teams of data scientists, and equip them with tools like R, Python, SAS, and SQL to execute predictive and statistical modeling. In 2007, Michael Schmidt, then a PhD student in Computational Biology at Cornell, believed that the volume of data and complexity of problems that humans could solve were ever-increasing, and the number of data scientists was not. Instead of relying on more people to fill the data science gap, Schmidt and his advisor, Hod Lipson, invented Eureqa, believing machines could extract meaning from data automatically. Eureqa is an artificial intelligence-powered \\"Virtual Data Scientist\\" that automatically builds predictive and analytical models, and allows domain experts to rapidly iterate on them. TechCrunch has called Eureqa one of the first examples of Machine Intelligence ‚Äì the subfield of A.I. that automates the discovery and explanation of answers from data. In early November 2009 the program was made available to download for free by anyone. Lipson described the machine's benefit in dealing with fields that are overwhelmed with data but lack theory to explain it. In the October 2011 edition of \\"Physical Biology\\", Lipson described a yeast experiment that predicted seven known equations. This took place after Lipson had asked scientists from different disciplines to share their work to test Eureqa's versatility. The program was named Eureqa after Archimedes' famous expression \\"Eureka!\\", with the k replaced by a q to evoke the word equation.  Technology  Eureqa works by creating random equations with the data through evolutionary search. Most of the equations do not fit the data well, but a few of the equations will fit the data better than the others and those will be used as the basis of a new round of several billion more equations until a sufficiently good fit is reached. This has been used to discover formula with \\"invariant relationships\\", such as laws of nature.  Reception and Use  As of 2015, over 80,000 people, including researchers, students, and Fortune 500 companies have made use of the program. People have used the application for many uses, such as analyzing the herding of cattle and understanding the behavior of the stock market.
