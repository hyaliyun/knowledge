Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003 His father, Major Lindsay Campbell-Gray, Master of Gray (1894-1945), was a World War I veteran and later trainer of steeplechasers. His mother was Doreen McClymont Tubbs. His father died when he was 13 and his mother when he was 17. He was educated at Eton College, near Windsor. Career He started his career at Mather & Crowther, an advertising firm, where he designed the label on HP Sauce bottles. He moved to Canada in 1956, where he worked for the Bell Telephone Corporation. Later, he became the owner of the Taynuilt Hotel in Argyll, Scotland. He also owned a petrol station where he attended to the pumps himself. He inherited his title from his late paternal grandmother, Ethel Gray-Campbell, 21st Lady Gray, in 1946. As a result, he was a hereditary peer for more than half a century. In 1977, he suggested an amendment to what came to be known as the Scotland Act 1978 a year later. In 1999, he argued that the bill which led to the House of Lords Act 1999 ran afoul of the Act of Union, which let Scottish peers sit in the House of Lords. The Committee for Privileges looked into his objection before the bill was passed. He was interviewed in The Lord's Tale, a television documentary directed by Molly Dineen about hereditary peers. He was involved with the Oban Games, the local Highland games in Oban. Indeed, he served as a steward of the Argyllshire Gathering, whose President is the Duke of Argyll. He also attended the Oban Ball. A keen foxhunter, he took part in the West Waterford Hunt in County Waterford, Ireland. He owned a small filling station in Argyll. Personal life He was married twice.

Its focus is on the first wave of over 4,000,000 Poles who migrated from Poland between 1870 and 1920. This film was produced in 2013 by Amerykafilm LLC., (Adrian Prawica ‚Äì Director and Editor, Rafa≈Ç Muska≈Ça ‚Äì Associate Producer, Mirek Miyo Mardosz, Andrzej Krzeptowski- Bohac, Jeton Murtishi, S≈Çawomir Bielawiec, and Jan Zienko ‚Äì music). The world premiere was on November 8, 2013 as part of the 25th Polish Film Festival in America (Chicago), where the film received the \\"Discovering Eye Award\\". It was also awarded with \\"Best Documentary Debut\\" at the 20th Polish Film Festival in Ann Arbor (Michigan). The film won the popular award at the 3rd Annual Polish Film festival in Vancouver, Ca. (2014). Adrian Prawica was awarded the Waclaw Lednicki Humanities Award from the Polish Institute of Arts & Sciences in America (2014), and the Creative Arts Prize from the Polish American Historical Association (2015). Plot At the dawn of the 20th century, Chicago was the second largest city in the United States with over 2,000,000 residents. It was also the center of Polish culture and political activism in America. With Poland partitioned between Russia, Austria, and Germany, over 4,000,000 Poles immigrated to the United States between 1870 and 1920 in search of a better life. In Chicago, they worked in some of the most dangerous factories and mills in the United States. In their neighborhoods, they built communities, churches, and most of all, aided their beloved Poland in her fight for independence. Their story is known as the \\"Fourth Partition\\". Donald Pienkos, James Pula, and Dominic Pacyga discuss places and events from the early 20th century that had historical significance in Polish-American History. They provide a picture of struggling immigrants who didn‚Äôt speak the English language, or were aware of the reality in the \\"New World\\". They were hired in steel mills and packing houses to do some of the most difficult and often lowest paying manual labor. Historians discuss neighborhoods where Poles lived, built churches, and created their communities. Poles not only named their neighborhoods after Polish parishes (Stanislawowo, Tr√≥jcowo, Helenowo) and tried to keep their culture, but also aided Poland in its fight for independence. The film‚Äôs creators present economical and historical reasons for the Polish migration to the United States. The film starts in 1608, at the Jamestown colony, when the first Poles arrive. From there, it talks about the first large Polish settlement in Panna Maria, Texas, and Chicago, as the center for Polish culture in America. Historians and Polish journalists debate about social and political strengths of Polish community in Chicago, which resulted not only as an active participation in local authorities, but also in fraternal organizations. Poles also created their military structure ‚Äì \\"Blue Army\\" led by General J√≥zef Haller. Production The film was released in 2013 by Amerykafilm, LLC., and was produced by Adrian Prawica & Rafa≈Ç Muska≈Ça.

After leaving school at 16, Mann attended St Austell College before becoming a postman for the Royal Mail and was based at the local sorting office in Wadebridge. In 2007, Mann was elected as a Conservative councillor for Wadebridge West, serving briefly on the North Cornwall District Council before it was absorbed by the now unitary authority that is Cornwall Council in 2009, when he was re-elected. In 2013, Mann retained his seat as county councillor for Wadebridge West.\\"About Scott\\", North Cornwall View (magazine); accessed 15 May 2015.

Mann was subsequently elected as the Member of Parliament for the constituency of North Cornwall after winning the seat in the 2015 General Election. Mann received 21,689 votes, beating the previous MP, Dan Rogerson, by 6,621 votes with an approximate 9,000 vote swing. He became the first Conservative MP for the area since 1992, as well as contributing to all six Cornwall constituencies electing Conservative candidates‚Äîthe first time in over a hundred years. Along with Sarah Newton, MP for Truro & Falmouth, he took his Parliamentary oath in the Cornish language. Following his election as an MP he resigned as a Councillor in February 2016, after he had come under pressure to resign for his poor attendance at council meetings. At the subsequent by-election in April 2016, his former seat was won by the Liberal Democrat candidate Karen McHugh. In November 2015, Mann introduced a Private Member's Bill to give Town and Parish Councils the power to hold community referendums to alter speed limits. The Bill received its second reading in February 2016, but as it was opposed by both the Government and the Opposition, it was subsequently withdrawn. Mann campaigned for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union in the 2016 EU referendum. In December 2016, Mann was elected (unopposed) to the House of Commons' Environmental Audit Select Committee, a role he served in until May 2017. In June 2017, Mann was re-elected as the MP for North Cornwall following the snap general election, garnering 23,835 votes and a 50.7% share of the vote. His majority also increased to 7,200 votes.2017 United Kingdom general election Mann was subsequently appointed as a Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) for Transport ‚Äì an unpaid role to assist and support government ministers in the Department for Transport. Following the Cabinet reshuffle in January 2018, Mann was appointed as PPS to HM Treasury. In July 2018, Mann introduced his second Private Member's Bill ‚Äì namely the Bathing Waters Bill ‚Äì to introduce penalties which could be levied against water companies who pump sewage into the sea. During heavy rainfall, sewage is sometimes pumped into the sea through Combined Sewage Overflow systems to reduce pressure on sewage systems. On 16 July 2018, Mann resigned from his role as Parliamentary Private Secretary to HM Treasury in protest at the Prime Minister Theresa May's \\"watered down\\" Brexit plan. In September 2018, he agreed with fellow Conservative MP Johnny Mercer that the Prime Minister Theresa May 'could not lead their party into the next general election'. Mann employs his partner as a part-time Secretary on a salary up to ¬£30,000. He was listed in articles in The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian criticising the practice of MPs employing family members, on the lines that it promotes nepotism. Although MPs who were first elected in 2017 have been banned from employing family members, the restriction is not retrospective ‚Äì meaning that Mann's employment of his partner is lawful. In May 2016, it emerged that Mann was one of a number of Conservative MPs being investigated by police in the United Kingdom general election, 2015 party spending investigation, for allegedly spending more than the legal limit on constituency election campaign expenses. However, in May 2017, the Crown Prosecution Service said that while there was evidence of inaccurate spending returns, it did not \\"meet the test\\" for further action. In March 2017, the Daily Telegraph reported that Mann was one of nine MPs who had claimed Amazon Prime subscriptions on their parliamentary expenses. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, responsible for handling expenses claims, told the paper subscriptions could be claimed but MPs must \\"justify the subscription is primarily used for Parliamentary purposes\\". He responded that the subscription was a mistake after his office had purchased stationery from the website, and that Amazon had issued a refund. In December 2019, Mann was re-elected as Member of Parliament for North Cornwall, more than doubling his majority to 14,752 with 59.4% of the vote - up by 8.6 percentage points from 2017. Shortly after his return to Parliament in January 2020, Mann was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Gavin Williamson, the Secretary of State for Education.https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/economy/opinion/dods- people/109168/new-appointments-week-uk-politics-civil-service-and In 2020 Mann became one of four Vice-Chairs of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Whistleblowing, which has been subject to criticism by some campaigners on whistleblowing law reform. Personal life Mann lives in Wadebridge and in London. He is the honorary vice-president of Wadebridge Cricket Club.Profile, wadebridge.play-cricket.com; accessed 15 May 2015. He is a supporter of Plymouth Argyle F.C. On a summer boat trip in 2016 Mann had to be rescued from drowning by fellow MP Johnny Mercer because he was \\"ashamed to admit\\" he could not swim. Writing to raise awareness, he said he endangered his life because he was \\"afraid to own up to something that [he] considered an embarrassment\\". He has since taken swimming lessons.

It first flew in the early 1990s; about six have been completed. Design and development The Minacro is the only biplane amongst Jean Pottier's many light aircraft designs. Like them, it was intended to be home built from his plans. It is a compact wood and fabric single bay aerobatic biplane, with noticeable stagger. There is a single, wide chord interplane strut on each side, assisted by flying wires and a pair of N-form cabane struts between the upper wing centre-section and the fuselage. Behind the engine the fuselage is flat-sided, though with rounded decking. The windscreen of the open cockpit is immediately under the upper wing trailing edge. Both the fin and balanced rudder are broad chord and the latter extends down to the keel so that the elevators, mounted near the top of the fuselage require a cut-out to allow their operation. The Minacro has a fixed, tailwheel undercarriage with its main wheels, often spatted, on cantilever legs from the lower fuselage just behind the engine. The first Minacro was built in Austria, making its first flight in about 1991 or 1992 powered by a Potez 4E-20A engine. Later French-built examples have Continental C90 or Continental O-200-A engines. All of these are air-cooled flat-fours.

Development In 1996, China ordered 14 Tor-M1 missile systems from Russia which were delivered under contract in 1997. In 1999, another contract for 13 Tor-M1 systems was signed between Russia and China. Delivery of the systems took place in 2000. Around 2000, China sought to license-produce the Tor-M1 missile system locally. However Russia reportedly refused. As a result China decided to reverse-engineer the missile system In early 2015, the HQ-17 was publicly revealed. It was reported that when a designer from the Russian Kupol factory saw the photos of HQ-17, he said that it confirmed Russia‚Äôs long-term suspicion that China had cloned the Tor-M1. In the 2018 Zhuhai Airshow exhibition, a new wheeled variant named FM-2000 was unveiled. Design Although reverse engineered from the Tor-M1, the HQ-17 is not a direct copy and instead features many improvements. Unlike the Tor system, the HQ-17 incorporates an indigenous all terrain tracked launch vehicle, a new identification friend or foe (IFF) antenna on top of the search radar, an electronically scanned array radar for better performance against jamming and the ability to datalink with other Chinese systems. The HQ-17 operates in batteries. A typical battery consists of 4 launch vehicles, reloading vehicles and other support vehicles. The battery is also supported by a mobile command post, based on a tracked chassis. Although a battery of the HQ-17 usually operates independently, it can also use targeting data from other surveillance radars. The HQ-17 is designed to keep up with mechanized troops like tank battalions to provide air cover on the move, as well as protect military sites. = Missile = The HQ-17 is physically similar to the Tor-M1, with a weight of around 165 kg, length of around 2.9 m and diameter of around 0.23 m. It's slant range for intercepting flying aerial targets is 1.5 km to 15 km, slightly longer than the Tor-M1, and operates at an altitude of 10 m to 10 km.https://twitter.com/Ninja998998/status/1105683969364750337/photo/1 The missile guidance system comprises of semi-active radar homing guided by the radar on the launch vehicle. It was reported that the missile was designed to protect frontline units from helicopter and drone attacks, and that its vertically launched missiles also allows it to simultaneously engage multiple cruise missiles like the American Tomahawk or Taiwanese HF-IIE aimed at Chinese command and control infrastructure. = Launch vehicle = The launch vehicle of the HQ-17 integrates launchers with missiles and radar on a single chassis and thus is able to operate independently. Each launch vehicle carries one PESA search radar and one AESA guidance radar. Notably, the location of the radars are opposite for the tracked variant and wheeled variant. For the tracked variant, the search radar is located at the front and guidance radar at the rear. For the wheeled variant, the search radar is located at the rear and guidance radar at the front. Each launch vehicle carries 2 x 4 missile canisters for a total of 8 missiles, which can be reloaded 4 missiles at a time by a Shaanxi SX2306 reloading truck equipped with a crane.  Tracked variant  The tracked launch vehicle is produced by China in Inner Mongolia.The vehicle weighs around 32 tons, and is about 8 m long, 3.2 m tall and 4 m wide. It is reportedly powered by a roughly 750-800 hp diesel engine and has a maximum speed of 65 km/h and range of 600 km.. It is manned by a crew of 3.  Wheeled variant  The wheeled launch vehicle is produced by Dongfeng Motor Corporation and is a 6x6 chassis similar to a Belarusian MZKT-6922. The vehicle weighs around 30 tons, and is about 9.7 m long, 3.1 m tall and 3.7 m wide. Features include an all-wheel drive system, central tire pressure system and a lightly armored which provides some degree of protection against small arms fire and shell splinters. It is reportedly powered by a roughly 400 HP diesel engine and has a maximum speed of 80 km/h and range of 800 km.https://www.armyrecognition.com/defense_news_july_2020_global_security_army_industry/chinese_hq-17a_shorad_air_defense_system_deployed_by_pla_78th_army_group.html Supposedly, the wheeled launch vehicle was produced because of a flaw of the tracked variant, which was having a long lag time between stopping and shooting. The wheeled vehicle, in the form of the FM-2000 supposedly features upgraded electronic countermeasures (ECM) in the form of counter-jamming capability against multiple targets..

Originally called Eclipse Colony, it was initially released as a Kickstarter crowdfunding project in early access for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux in November 2013, and was officially released on October 17, 2018.  Plot  The futuristic plot starts off revolving around three characters who are stranded on a planet located in the frontiers of known space (a \\"rim world\\"), where their space liner crashed. The characters have a randomly generated set of traits which affect how they can contribute to the colony, the decisions they make, and how their existence affects the other characters. As time goes on, more characters will join the colony. They can either choose to join, or they can be taken prisoner and talked into joining the colony during their confinement. The game can end when at least one character has escaped the planet on a spaceship, or when they are all dead. With the Royalty DLC, the game can also end by hosting the High Stellarch, leader of one of the factions that inhabit the Rim, and leaving the colony with them. However, players are given the choice to continue to play, as it's possible to wait for a wanderer to take up residence in the ruins of the colony and continue the game.}  Gameplay  The objective of the game is to ensure the survival of a colony of people, fighting against various environmental and/or internal events. Much of the difficulty as well as the critical acclaim for the game come from its unpredictability, through randomly generated events, and its extensively designed and customizable world. As the game progresses events become progressively harder and the player can unlock more advanced technology through research. The game has a top-down, two- dimensional view. =Random event generation - storytellers= During the set- up of a game-round, the backstory, medical conditions, capabilities and certain personality traits of the characters are randomly generated, but players may opt to re-randomize those traits indefinitely. In-game events are randomly generated by an AI storyteller,How RimWorld Generates Great Stories  Rock Paper Shotgun which is central to gameplay; game difficulty, event difficulty and difficulty progression depend on its settings. The game suggests three preconfigured AI storytellers, all of which have changeable difficulty settings: *Cassandra Classic steadily increases the difficulty of the game by increasing the difficulty of negative events as the time passes. *Phoebe Chillax gives large periods of peace between negative events, but these are still challenging to the player if set on a high difficulty. *Randy Random provides gameplay with unpredictable events occurring at random intervals. The level and frequency of negative events are randomly generated and can occur at any time. Events can be good (for example, a wanderer joins the colony), neutral (travellers passing through the area) or bad (a pirate raid, solar flare, etc.). When choosing a story teller the player also chooses what save mode and difficulty to play on. There are 6 different preset difficulties ranging from \\"Peaceful\\" to \\"Losing is fun\\", along with a custom difficulty option. These influence the severity and frequency of events as well as the good, neutral, bad balance of events. The game also has two modes for saving the game that needs to be chosen. One mode, called commitment mode, only lets the player save and exit the game making the choices made for each random event permanent. The other mode allows saving and loading anytime during the game allowing the player to experience multiple ways to respond to the event given. =Characters= Management of each character's psyche is a crucial aspect of gameplay. The characters' stability is represented by a mood meter, affected by basic or complex needs. Characters require food, rest and shelter but will also request a place to sit while eating, well made and undamaged clothes, or enough time for recreation like stargazing, cloud watching or playing chess. If needs are left unmet, characters may undergo \\"mental breaks\\" such as going into a broken daze or even going berserk and attacking other characters. With the release of Alpha 13 on April 6, 2016, a new social aspect to the game was introduced. Characters were given the ability to have social relationships with each other, and an opinion system was introduced. These relationships can benefit or detract from the needs and joys of a character, as poor social relationships may result in fights. In- game animals may also be controlled by the player, after being domesticated or tamed. Certain animals may be taught commands, which vary from simply obeying its master to defending them if attacked to occasionally deciding to carry and store items. = Technological progress = Another large aspect of game-play is technological progression. Early on players may harness electricity, which unlocks a plethora of machines and increases the colony's efficiency. However, players are then forced to find ways to generate electricity, including wind turbines, solar panels, or geothermal power stations. More technological progress is achieved through the research mechanic. By devoting time and personnel to research, players may unlock new advancements like medicine, advanced weaponry, or mind-altering substances. =Combat= Players may be forced into several combative events. For example, during a pirate attack, the player will have to defend the colony by either drafting the characters or by building defensive mechanisms around the colony. Such defensive measures may include traps and automated turrets. = Starvation = Characters in the game need constant nourishment. One of the challenges of a larger colony is finding a way to feed all the colonists. Players may combine hunting, farming, and animal husbandry to meet the colonist's needs. Animals can be lured and tamed with food, but there is a small chance the animal will attack the tamer instead. Eleven animals were added including elephants, two breeds of dog, cows, chickens, boomrats (small animals that explode and set fires upon death), and others. Reproduction, a feature that was highly requested by players, was also added, allowing the player much more freedom in managing their animal populations. = Colonization = On December 20, 2016, Alpha version 16 \\"Wanderlust\\" was released. Many new features were added regarding the world map; these included: changing the world to be spherical, time-zones, factions now starting with many bases, the ability to travel the world, the ability to set up multiple colonies, world generation, and world generation parameters. It is possible for players to attack other bases and plunder resources from them, angering the attacked faction in the process. = Modifications = Players are able to install modifications distributed via the Steam Workshop, the game's official forums, or other distribution sites. Reception The game has been favourably compared to other difficult management-survival games such as Dwarf Fortress. =Accolades= In 2016 RimWorld was voted Indie DB's \\"indie of the year\\". In 2018 Rimworld was voted Steam's Top User-Rated Game, from all categories. The game was nominated in 2019 for the category of \\"Strategy/Simulation Game of the Year\\" at the 22nd D.I.C.E. Awards. Development On February 24, 2020 the first DLC, Royalty, was released with the 1.1 update, adding a new empire faction and psylink technology for colonists to use. It also introduces the concept of royal titles, mechanoid clusters, 13 more songs to the soundtrack, more possible quests and more body implants and types of weapons.

It was designed by Frank Gibson Costello and built by Brisbane City Council. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 April 2005.  History  The Brisbane City Council built the stone shelter at King Edward Park as an air raid shelter in 1942. On 7 December 1941, the United States of America entered World War Two following the bombing of the American fleet at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii by Japanese carrier-borne aircraft. England and its Commonwealth had been at war with Germany since September 1939, but now the war was truly global. The Japanese first bombed Darwin on 19 February 1942 and 14,000 Australians were taken prisoner following the fall of Singapore. Plans to defend Australia from an anticipated Japanese invasion and to use Queensland as a support base for the conduct of the Pacific war were implemented quickly. Australian and American personnel poured into Queensland and urgently required a wide range of new buildings and facilities. The population of Brisbane swelled dramatically. As it was the major city in Queensland, and the most northerly major population centre in Australia, military planning headquarters were set up in Brisbane, as were a number of important maintenance, communication, and supply facilities. General Douglas MacArthur, Commander in Chief of the Allied Forces, Southwest Pacific, was based in the AMP building at the corner of Queen Street and Edward Street in Brisbane, and General Sir Thomas Blamey, Commander in Chief of the Australian Forces, used the recently constructed University of Queensland buildings at St Lucia. Brisbane was obviously a strategic target for bombing, and rapid action had to be taken to protect the population in the event of air raids. The demand on materials, services and labour was enormous and military projects took precedence in their allocation. Heavy Anti-Aircraft batteries were built at Victoria Park, Hendra, Pinkenba, Fort Lytton, Hemmant and Balmoral, and coastal artillery batteries were established on Bribie and Moreton Islands. Before the war, Queensland had a small population and no heavy manufacturing industries. To help overcome these problems, some buildings were prefabricated and standard designs for many structures were used. Designs took into account the scarcity of skilled labour and of some materials. The Brisbane City Council took responsibility for Air Raid Precautions activities, including establishing an Air Raid Warden system, firefighting systems and constructing air raid shelters. Aboveground salt water pipes were laid along city streets to aid in firefighting. On Christmas Eve, 1941, each Australian State's Emergency Committee issued instructions for government, private employers and private households to immediately start building shelters. Slit trenches were built in parks and schoolyards, windows were taped, and brownouts were applied to buildings. In the Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1, gazetted 23 December 1941, Premier William Forgan Smith, with powers conferred by Regulation 35a, National Security (General) Regulations, ordered the Brisbane City Council to construct 200 public surface shelters in the city area. Work had already started on 15 December, and later another 75 shelters were ordered. However, only 235 air raid shelters were constructed, the building programme being 90% complete by June 1942. In addition, around three kilometres of covered trenches were constructed in public parks, in 13 projects, including of concrete-pipe covered trench in the Botanic Gardens, and of the same in Victoria Park. It was believed that one person could be accommodated by each foot of trench. In addition to the public shelters, the Brisbane City Council also constructed shelters for leased wharves and council properties, including at the Stanley Wharf, Circular Quay Wharves 2,3 and 4, Norman Wharf, and Musgrave Wharf. Shelters were built under the Story Bridge, for Kangaroo Point shipbuilding workers, and five shelters were constructed on behalf of the Bureau of Industry at the Howard Smith Wharves. The Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1 was applied statewide, and outside Brisbane another 24 Local Authorities in Queensland's coastal areas were ordered to produce surface or trench shelters for the public, to be built according to the Air Raid Shelter Code laid down in the Second Schedule of Order No.1. Initially, 20 of the Local Authorities were expected to construct a minimum total of 133 surface shelters, which were supposed to be able to withstand the blast of a 500-pound bomb bursting away. Four other Local Authorities would only build trenches. However, after plans were amended, 23 Local Authorities outside Brisbane, excluding Thursday Island, ended up possessing a total of 129 public shelters: 123 surface and six underground. This effort had cost . Where Local Authorities were unwilling or unable to build the required number of code-compliant shelters, in some cases because they had already begun erecting other shelters, the Department of Public Works became responsible for the shelters' construction. However, this led to problems when the Department tried to recoup half of the cost from the Local Authorities in question. Townsville, Toowoomba, Gladstone, and Ayr denied any liability for costs, and a Bill had to be passed in December 1942 to force their compliance. The Ayr Shire Council had claimed that the shelters would be death traps during an air raid. Of the 235 surface shelters built in Brisbane for the public, 21 survive and are still owned by the Brisbane City Council. One of the shelters, on Queens Wharf Road, is a site-specific \\"special\\" variation of the standard pillbox design. It is listed in the Queensland Heritage Register as part of the entry for the porphyry retaining wall on William Street. The other 20 public shelters owned by the Brisbane City Council can be divided into three types of pillbox intended for conversion after the war: \\"park\\", \\"bus\\", and \\"bus (stone)\\". They were designed to serve as structures such as bus waiting shelters or shade structures for parks, with some or all of the perimeter blast walls to be removed, leaving the concrete slab roof, floor slab and piers. The reusable pillboxes were designed to hold 70 people, as were the non- reusable standard pillboxes. F.G. Costello, Brisbane City Council City Architect between 1941 and 1952, was responsible for the design of the surface air raid shelters, and his variants of the standard pillbox were designed to provide a post-war utility for at least part of the Council's shelter building programme. In an address delivered to the Constitutional Club in Brisbane on February 1942, Costello noted that \\"if the emergency for their use does not arise ...(unused shelters)... remain in brick and concrete, in many cases having no further value and being a possible source of nuisance. He added that I can assure you that wherever it is possible, without sacrificing the primary requirements of shelter from air attack, I have endeavoured in our Council buildings to so plan the shelters that they will fit into schemes of improvement which we hope will proceed immediately after the war\\". The air raid shelter is camouflaged by the overhead trees, 2015 Costello's work was characterised by the use of an architectural language inspired by the modern movement in architecture. This movement pursued the rational use of modern materials and principles of functionalist planning and established a visual aesthetic largely inspired by the machine. It was part of an architecture employing the language of vertical and horizontal volumes and planes, floating flat roofs, masses set against voids and monumentality. Though modest in scale and form, the design of the shelters is characteristic of work in this idiom. The reusable shelters were often sited under fig trees, to aid in camouflage. The first of Costello's reusable designs is the pillbox with double- cantilevered roof slab, or \\"park\\" type shelter. In an original list of all the shelters constructed by the Brisbane City Council, these were simply labelled as \\"cantilever\\". They had four central piers supporting the roof slab, which allowed for the removal of the four blast walls after the war. There was an entrance at each end of the front wall, where an internal wall extended into the shelter. If the walls were made of brick, the shelter's dimension was by by high, and if concrete was used the dimensions were by by high. The difference was due to the fact that the brick walls finished in line with the top of the roof slab, covering the fascia, whereas the concrete walls finished at the soffit of the roof slab, flush with the fascia. The minimum wall thickness for brick was set at , and for concrete. The roof slab was intended to have at least of concrete. Of the 37 reusable shelters listed as being of the park type only 17 survive: one at Hefferan Park in Annerley; two at Albert Park; two at Wickham Park; one in Buranda Playground in Woolloongabba; two in Raymond Park in Kangaroo Point; and one each at Kelvin Grove, Morningside, Nundah, Stones Corner, and Windsor. Four other shelters stand on East Street and Wickham Street in Fortitude Valley. Most are used as simple park shelters, as intended, but the shelter at Nundah has been modified as a toilet block, and the shelter at Kelvin Grove is used as a bus shelter (as distinct from those shelters in the next category, which were specifically designed as \\"bus\\" type shelters). About half of the surviving park shelters had concrete blast walls, while half used brick. The second design was the pillbox with single- cantilevered roof slab, or \\"bus\\" type shelter, as it was called in the original Brisbane City Council list. These were designed so that the three brick blast walls could be removed after the war, leaving a concrete back wall and five brick piers at the front. Again, entrances were at each end of the front wall. Of the 19 \\"bus\\" types listed only two survive, at Newmarket and Newstead. The third design was also a \\"bus\\" type shelter, but it was built with a stone rear wall, instead of concrete, and six stone piers were later added, instead of five brick piers. The three brick blast walls could be removed as normal. Two of these \\"colonnade\\" types were built ‚Äî referred to in the Brisbane City Council list as \\"bus (stone)\\" ‚Äî and only this one survives, at King Edward Park. Most of the Brisbane structures built for the war were removed at the end of World War Two. The saltwater mains, slit trenches, and sirens disappeared, as did the many standard pillboxes that had stood in the middle of the streets of the Central Business District. 156 standard pillboxes were built, but none of the surviving public shelters in Brisbane City Council ownership are of that design. Of the 21 special shelters, only the one on Queens Wharf Road survives. However, of Costello's 58 reusable public surface shelters, 20 have survived; the removal of their blast walls, as planned, had given them a renewed purpose. The worker's shelters at the Story Bridge Hotel and Howard Smith Wharves also still exist. Stone piers at the front of the shelter, 2015 The front blast wall of the air raid shelter at King Edward Park was removed according to plan after World War Two, and six stone piers were added at the front of the shelter. Evidence of the location of the wall is still visible. The original shelter roof has been removed and was replaced in 1995 by a slab roof replicating the original. Two timber benches have been added.  Description  The King Edward Park air raid shelter is a rectangular stone and concrete structure comprising a heavy floor slab, rear and side nib blast walls of sandstone, six sandstone piers and a flat concrete roof. The shelter is approached by two flights of concrete stairs from Turbot Street. All the stonework features a hammered finish. The concrete roof is new; there is no evidence of blast wall removal on the soffit, and there is an additional narrow course of stone between the walls and piers and the roof.  Heritage listing  King Edward Park Air Raid Shelter was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 April 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The King Edward Park air raid shelter is important as a part of the Air Raid Precaution activities that were implemented for the defence of Brisbane during World War Two. Designed to afford protection to the civilian population of Brisbane in the event of air raid attacks or other emergencies, the air raid shelter located on the edge of the park facing Turbot Street is important in demonstrating the impact of World War Two on the civilian population of Brisbane. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Although many air raid shelters were constructed during World War Two in Queensland, comparatively few survive. Also, there are not many types of structures built by the Brisbane City Council during World War Two, for wartime purposes, which survive. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The shelter's solid construction, rectangular shape, and its siting near a population concentration, demonstrate the principal characteristics of a World War Two Brisbane public air raid shelter. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The King Edward Park air raid shelter, now used as a shade shelter, demonstrates the secondary uses that were part of the original design intention. The shelter is a durable example of innovative design and use of concrete technology during World War Two. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The air raid shelter is important as an example of the wartime work of the City Architect's Office and particularly the work of City Architect F.G. Costello.

Architecture  Kongstedlund, 2014 Kongstedlund, main building and side wing Kongstedlund was built on the foundations of an ancient, storied castle, and is surrounded by drained moats. The main building was constructed in 1592 for the Danish nobleman Niels Juul. In 1640, a sandstone portal in the Baroque-style was added to the entrance of the main building by the owners of the property, Ivar Krabbe and Dorte Juul. In the 1770s, a low half-timbered wing was attached to the main building. Kongstedtlund rests upon an old arched vault that has remained as part of the older construction. The mansion's facades are now whitewashed, but were originally made unpainted brick. The levels of the main building are marked by anchor plates. The rectangle windows are embedded in curved window slots. The gables are now adjusted to the saddle roof in a straight line, but were originally probably arched in the style of the Renaissance. The baroque sandstone portal with the initials of the owners by that time, Ivar Krabbe and Dorte Juul, is a particularly precious architectural detail. The most prominent elements of the portal are the sculptures of two warriors in full armour framing the entrance, as well as those of two angels, on which the uppermost part of the portal rests, and two female figures in the upper part which are framing a family coat of arms and a laurel wreath.Niels Peter Stilling: Politikens bog om Danmarks slotte og herreg√•rde.

It is based at Sully near the Welsh capital, Cardiff. History HMS Cambria was established as the Royal Naval Reserve unit for South Wales in July 1947 and originally occupied buildings in Cardiff Docks. Cambria remained in Cardiff until 1980, when the redevelopment of the docks there precipitated a move to the former service married couples' accommodation at Sully, Vale of Glamorgan in the Vale of Glamorgan. The unit was granted freedom of the vale in 2012, but is due to move to Cardiff Bay during 2020.. Over the years Cambria, like many other RNR units, operated a number of seagoing ships; a motor minesweeper - the unit's first tender - was replaced in 1954 by the wooden-hulled minesweeper Brereton, which gave way in turn to Crichton (1961-76); all of these were rechristened HMS St David. In 1978 the unit acquired a converted trawler, which was again renamed St David. The ship's final vessel, acquired in 1984, was the new minesweeper Waveney, which was not renamed. Waveney remained with HMS Cambria until 1994, when a reorganisation of the RNR led to the abandonment of seagoing tenders.Davies J.D. (2013), Britannia's Dragon: A Naval History of Wales.

The Phantoms began with two students, composed of vocalist/keyboardist Bruce Blackman and drummer Roy Whittaker. Soon, the group added lead guitarist Johnny Walker, rhythm guitarist Jerry Bounds, and bassist Charlie Ross, and began developing the complex, overlapping vocal harmonies that were utilized when they became Eternity's Children in 1967. Their one and only hit, \\"Mrs. Bluebird\\", topped at number 69 on the Billboard Hot 100. History =Beginnings= In 1965, Bruce Blackman and Roy Whittaker, students of Delta College, founded The Phantoms, and added fellow students Jerry Bounds, Charlie Ross, and Johnny Walker. The band played locally within the college and gained a sizable local following. They released a single titled \\"Workin' Tired\\" b/w \\"Gonna Be Nice Tonight\\" on the local Flash label before relocating to Biloxi, Mississippi in 1966. Here, in Biloxi, the group became a house band in a basement nightclub of the Biloxi Hotel. The band, when they were not the lead performance, would back musicians like Charlie Rich and B.J. Thomas. In the same year, the band added folk singer Linda Lawley (April 18, 1949 ‚Äì November 24, 2007) and changed their name to Eternity's Children. Another single, both songs composed by Blackman, titled \\"Can't Put A Thing Over Me\\" b/w \\"Time and Place\\" was released on another local label called Apollo. However, the single made little impact outside their local following. =Major label= As 1966 turned to 1967, the band recorded a demo after the manager of a club in Baton Rouge named Ray Roy watched one of their live performances. Roy convinced his business partner Guy Belello to sign the group to a recording contract and become their manager. Eternity's Children's quickly recorded a demo that made its way to A&M; Records manager, Allen Stanton. In the spring of 1967, the group (relocated to Los Angeles) released their one and only single for the label called \\"Wait and See\\". It was produced by former Music Machine bassist Keith Olsen. The record flopped and, despite successful touring in which the band opened for bands like Strawberry Alarm Clock and The Blues Magoos, they were dropped from the A&M; label. Despite not obtaining a hit single, the group did attract attention from Capitol Records, who signed them to a contract. Under the label's Tower subsidiary the band, with production by Keith Olsen and Curt Boettcher, released their most successful single, \\"Mrs. Bluebird\\" b/w \\"Little Boy\\". \\"Mrs. Bluebird\\" became a modest hit despite the limited promotion, and was a prime example of the group's vocal harmonies. An appearance on American Bandstand propelled the group to the national pop charts, where \\"Mrs. Bluebird\\" reached #69 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #54 on the Cash Box Top 100 in August 1968, but success would be short-lived as the single dropped off the charts after three weeks. Its followup, \\"Sunshine Among Us\\", was less successful, peaking at #117 on the Billboard Bubbling Under chart in September of the same year. During work on Eternity's Children's debut studio album, managerial and musical indifference caused Blackman, Bounds, and Walker to exit from band activity. Blackman, regarding the tension, stated \\"We did not survive because of incredibly bad management...After I left the group they tried to cheat me of any credit\\". Only keyboardist Mike \\"Kid\\" McClain would be included as a replacement and the remaining members of Ross, Whittaker, and Lawley would continue to record the album. Eternity's Children would be released in 1968 and became a local interest in Los Angeles for its style set in psychedelic pop and sunshine pop, but failed to chart nationally. Producers Olsen and Boettcher utilized studio musicians so it is difficult to definitively depict who is playing on a given track. =Second LP and later happenings= Despite the disappointment of the group's debut album, Eternity's Children reconvened with a new producer, Gary Paxton. Bruce Blackman (the main songwriter of their past album) left the band before recording began, leaving Ross, Lawley, and McClain to contribute to the all-original material for the album. Percussionist Bo Wagner replaced Whittaker and took part in the 1969 single \\"Till I Hear It From You\\" b/w \\"I Wanna Be With You\\". When the single did not chart, Capitol Records withdrew the American release of their second album, Timeless. It did receive a limited release in Canada, however, where \\"Mrs. Bluebird\\" was most successful. But with the high asking price, not many fans of the band bought the album, and it has since become a difficult item to find. With the botched second album, the remaining members of Eternity's Children moved to Memphis, Tennessee and were matched with a different producer, Chips Moman, to produce a third album. That album never materialized, but the group continued to release more singles on the Capitol label throughout 1969. When Capitol cut business relations with the group, they moved to independent labels back in Mississippi the following year to record more singles. Those met with little success, however, and Eternity's Children disbanded, while variations of the group continued to tour until 1974. Wagner, Blackman, and Walker went on to be a part of the band Starbuck, achieving a number three hit in the spring and summer of 1976 with their debut single, \\"Moonlight Feels Right\\". On September 30, 2003, a compilation album titled The Lost Sessions was released, and included rare recorded material of the band from the 1960s to their early 1970s material.

A native of the MƒÉrginimea Sibiului region in Transylvania, he left for the Romanian Old Kingdom, where he attended university, followed up by a doctorate at the University of Berlin. In 1907, he became a professor at the University of Ia»ôi, where he taught until his death; over time, his research interests gradually shifted from literature to linguistics. Meanwhile, he fought in World War I and twice led his university in the postwar period: in the early 1920s and during the 1930s. A left-leaning member of the National Peasants' Party, he was president of the Romanian Senate from 1928 to 1931. He actively opposed the far right, clashing with the followers of A. C. Cuza and with the Iron Guard; the latter organization made two unsuccessful attempts on his life. Biography =Origins and academic pursuits= Born in RƒÉ»ôinari, Sibiu County, in the MƒÉrginimea Sibiului area of Transylvania, at the time part of Austria-Hungary, he grew up in a peasant family. He attended primary school in his native village, followed by the Hungarian-language state high school in Sibiu.Mamina, p.380 Right after finishing high school in 1894,Boia, pp.198-99 he left for the Romanian Old Kingdom, without emigration papers.BuruianƒÉ, p.276 There, he studied literature at the University of Bucharest and graduated in 1898. He then taught German at a gymnasium and a seminary in R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea between 1900 and 1902, after which he moved to the National College in Ia»ôi. There, his subjects were German and Latin, and he remained on the faculty until 1916. Anuarul UniversitƒÉ»õii MihƒÉilene din Ia»ôi, 1930-1935, pp.208-09\\\\. Editura UniversitƒÉ»õii MihƒÉilene, Ia»ôi, 1936 Subsequently, he specialized in German studies at the University of Berlin from 1902 to 1907, earning a doctorate on the lyric poetry of Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu√©. In October 1907, he was hired as a professor of Germanistics at Ia»ôi University in the Moldavia region; he would hold this post until his death. Initially a lecturer, he rose to associate professor in 1913 and full professor in 1916. In 1909, he married Erika Schmidt, who was German- Jewish.NastasƒÉ, p.16-17 At first, his academic interest tended toward literature; a volume on German language and literature in Romanian universities appeared in 1908. He was very active over the next few years, publishing a study of classical German poetry in 1909 and an analysis of Ernst Zahn's work in 1912. Moreover, in 1905, he had written a study of Friedrich Schiller's fragmentary play about Perkin Warbeck. He sent a work on the reception of popular German books to a conference at Leipzig University; this would appear in volume form in 1936. Later, his interests shifted toward linguistics. He finished a study of word order in Low German in 1934, published in Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur in mid-1938. Karl Kurt Klein, a Transylvanian Saxon, was a collaborator of his at Ia»ôi from 1923; together, the two devised a new method for teaching German. \\"Short history\\", at the German Studies Department site of Alexandru Ioan Cuza University =Wartime service and university administration= Although an avowed admirer of Germany, Bratu was a second lieutenant in the Romanian Land Forces, and when his country entered World War I on the side of the Allies in 1916, he served with distinction on the front. He initially saw action in August in Dobruja, after which he was advanced to the rank of lieutenant. He then fought in Moldavia, at Oituz and on the Trotu»ô River valley. He was demobilized in May 1918, and looked with scorn upon his pro-Allied colleagues Ioan Ursu, Oreste Tafrali and Ion GƒÉvƒÉnescul, who spent the war in Paris advocating on Romania's behalf. After their return from France, he would clash with the latter two, who pushed for dismissing Ilie BƒÉrbulescu from the faculty due to his \\"unpatriotic attitude\\".Boto»ôineanu, p.225 Together with faculty colleagues Garabet IbrƒÉileanu, Dimitrie Gusti and Ion Petrovici, Bratu displayed left-wing tendencies in the war's aftermath.Boto»ôineanu, p.223 Following the creation of Greater Romania in 1918, he advocated a melting pot approach toward the country's ethnic minorities, which would respect their civic rights and ensure their loyalty. This position brought him into conflict with A. C. Cuza and his disciples.Livezeanu, p.14 He became dean of the Ia»ôi literature faculty in October 1920,Boto»ôineanu, p.224 and served as university rector twice: from October 1921 to December 1922 and from December 1932 to June 1938. His first term as rector ended with his resignation: an anti- Semitic student movement had gripped the university, and when protesters continued to block Jewish students from entering its buildings, he quit in protest at government inaction. His interim successor, as the most senior dean, was his nemesis Cuza.Go»ôu, p.195 =Political involvement and later years= Bratu was a member of the National Peasants' Party (PN»ö) from March 1928. He represented his university in the Romanian Senate, serving as the body's president from 1928 to 1931. He held this office following the landslide PN»ö victory in the 1928 election, which produced the first Parliament led by that party.Stan, p.185 In 1932, he was again elected senator, this time representing Baia County.Giurescu, p.84 He opposed political extremism, particularly as embodied by the Iron Guard. This led to two attempts on his life, in 1936 and 1937; the latter attack left him with an earlobe cut off. He died of lung cancer in Bucharest, although official historiography under the communist regime would assert his demise was brought on by the Guardist attacks.Bozgan, p.326Hudi»õƒÉ, p.251 References Notes *Lucian Boia, \\"Germanofilii\\".

The town was originally intended to be on the new railway extending north from Quorn, but the final route passed through Gordon instead. Today, the stone ruins of a hotel and its cellars are still visible. The town is reported as being \\"named after Sir Lintorn Simmons, Field Marshal and Commandant of the Royal Engineers\\" by William Jervois, the 10th Governor of South Australia. The creation of the town was announced in April 1880 as follows: \\"Portions of Crown Lands in the Hundred of Kanyaka have been reserved as a site for the new town of Simmonston.\\" Plans to build the hotel were announced three weeks later in May 1880 by a D.

Background The title song, \\"Sometimes a Memory Ain't Enough\\", was another Top 10 for Lewis, peaking at number 6 on the Billboard country singles chart on December 8, 1973 after 14 weeks on the chart. Lewis gives committed performances, although producer Stan Kesler's growing penchant of sweetening the sound with strings and backing vocalists diluted some of the harder edges that were evident on Jerry Lee's earlier country albums like Another Place, Another Time and Touching Home. It kept Lewis competitive on the radio, however, and the Stan Kesler-penned title track rose to number 6. Although Lewis had released the rocking The Session...Recorded in London with Great Artists earlier in the year, one listen to his new LP revealed that he had not turned his back on his country audience. He gives a moving performance on George Jones's \\"What My Woman Can't Do\\" and covers fellow pianist Leon Russell's lonely lament \\"My Cricket and Me.\\" The rollicking \\"I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone\\" was released as a second single and but did not crack the Top 20. Grand Ole Opry The release of Sometimes a Memory Ain't Enough followed not long after Lewis's first ever appearance on the Grand Ole Opry on January 20, 1973. Although Lewis had scored 14 Top 10 country hits since 1968 (including four chart toppers), \\"the Killer\\" had never been asked to perform at the hallowed Opry. As Colin Escott notes in the liner notes to A Half Century of Hits, Lewis had always maintained ambivalent feelings towards Music City ever since he'd been turned away as an aspiring musician before his glory days at Sun Records: \\"It was 18 years since he had left Nashville broke and disheartened...But for all the success (65 country hits at last counting), Lewis was never truly accepted in Nashville. He didn‚Äôt move there and didn‚Äôt schmooze there. He didn‚Äôt fit in with the family values crowd. Lewis family values weren‚Äôt necessarily worse, but they were different.\\" When Lewis finally took the stage, he broke just about every rule the Opry had. As recounted in a 2015 online Rolling Stone article by Beville Dunkerley, Lewis opened with his comeback single \\"Another Place, Another Time\\" and then announced to the audience, \\"Let me tell ya something about Jerry Lee Lewis, ladies and gentlemen: I am a rock and rollin', country-and-western, rhythm and blues-singin' motherfucker!\\" Ignoring his allotted time constraints - and, thus, commercial breaks - Lewis played for 40 minutes (the average Opry performance is two songs, for about eight maximum minutes of stage time) and invited Del Wood - the one member of the Opry who had been kind to him when he had been there as a teenager - out on stage to sing with him. He also blasted through \\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On,\\" \\"Workin' Man Blues,\\" \\"Good Golly Miss Molly,\\" and a host of others classics before leaving the stage to a thunderous standing ovation.

It lies at 16¬∞ 38‚Ä≤ 22‚Ä≥ W of the current international prime meridian, the IERS Reference Meridian through Greenwich. Cartographers in the Low Countries Cartographers like Mercator, Hondius and Blaeu played a significant role in the development of cartography around the turn of the seventeenth century. They were also among the first (in Europe) to deviate from the use of the Ferro meridian, which was based on the works of the Greek astronomer and geographer Ptolemy (c. AD 90 ‚Äì c. 168). Mercator used prime meridians through Fuerteventura, the Azores and Boa Vista. Other mapmakers put their reference meridians through different places in the Canaries, the Azores, or the Cape Verde. Near the end of his career Mercator came under the influence of the idea that there could be a nature-given reference line where no difference would be observed between geographic and magnetic poles. His lead was followed by cartographers like Abraham Ortelius and Jodocus Hondius. Both inconclusive observations and new scientific theory, in particular that of Henry Gellibrand, put an end to this theory in the first half of the seventeenth century. Tenerife Determination of longitude at sea was not possible without a considerable margin of error until the mid 18th century. One of the methods that was used instead was dead reckoning, from the last point of land sighted. Lizard Point in Cornwall was a famous starting point for this, as was the 3,718 metre Teide volcano of Tenerife. From the early 1640s some Dutch cartographers were using Tenerife as a prime meridian in maps, with a significant increase in use after 1662.The VOC regarded maps and charts as strategic information. After some negligence and abuse of resources, a system of inventories was implemented in 1654. Navigators had to sign for maps issued, and for their return. While most of the maps have not survived, the inventories have. It's on these that Jonkers based his research on what meridians were used when and by whom.Jonkers, p. 15. Joan Blaeu started using it in 1663, Frederik de Wit in 1670, and German mapmakers Weigel and Homann in the 1720s/1730s.Forstner, p. 296. After 1675 Tenerife was the predominant meridian on Dutch maps and in 1787 the Amsterdam Admiralty issued a formal statement of support to the meridian.Jonkers, p. 7 Decline Also in 1787, the first Dutch translation of the Nautical Almanac was published. This almanac was one of the things that had spread the fame of the Greenwich meridian. By the turn of the 19th century Greenwich was becoming the meridian of choice for most of the maritime world, with the possible exception of the French and their Paris meridian. In 1826, the Dutch navy switched to Greenwich by royal decree. Without the backing of the Dutch, the meridian of Tenerife was hardly used anymore. Sources * A.R.T.

It was designed by H. S. Macdonald for the Queensland Brewery Company and built from 1940 to 1942. It is also known as Credit Union Australia Building and RACQ Building. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This building was constructed between 1940 and 1942 for the Queensland Brewery Company. Designed by Herbert Stanley Macdonald of Addison and Macdonald, it replaced the company's headquarters in Queen Street, Petrie Bight. Half the ground floor and the first floors were used as administrative offices, while the remainder of these floors and the top storey provided cellars, a wine and spirits department, cooperage and goods handling and loading facilities. The design was a departure from accepted forms for commercial buildings in Queensland at the time. Macdonald fused the assertive curves and angles of the Art Deco with the flowing horizontal lines of the Functionalist movement. This latter style was characterised by its simple geometric shapes, its light colours and large glass areas. The building also exemplified the use of new materials like the original glass brick of the circular entry tower and the synthetic stone of the original signage. Both these elements have since been removed. In February 1966 the property was purchased by the Royal Automobile Club of Australia (RACQ). Architects Cook and Kerrison & Partners adapted the building for its new use. The offices on the ground floor were occupied by customer services, the first floor accommodated the RACQ insurance staff, and the second floor provided management offices and two board rooms. In 1980 the property was sold to the Australia Post and Telecom Credit Union, although RACQ leased the building for three years until their new offices were constructed. Credit Union Australia purchased the property in 1983, and undertook further modifications.  Description  Parade of military passing the Queensland Brewery Company Building, July 1942 The three storeyed brick building is prominently located on the corner of Ann and Boundary Streets, opposite Centenary Place. It is built with applied Art Deco motifs influenced by the Functionalist movement. Horizontal strip windows delineate levels on the two street facades and contrast with the vertically expressed elements of the corner tower. This tower forms a prominent entry and also serves as the location for vertical circulation. A chevron motif is regularly spaced around its upper portion. The Ann Street facade has a cantilevered awning over a ramp providing access to a second entry. The main entry vestibule is a three storeyed void with a corner entry at the ground floor level and a second inner entry parallel to Ann Street. This makes the lower portion of this space asymmetrical. The original glass blocks of the corner piece have been replaced by curved plate glass. The lower portion of the three storeyed space is of concrete block while plaster is located above marked to simulate blockwork. The ceiling is plaster and has a decorated cornice and a vertical light fitting suspended from its centre. The stairwell is walled with plaster marked in a similar way to the upper portion of the entry vestibule. The stair has polished timber handrails with a metal balustrade and brackets. The passenger elevator is predominantly intact. Only some of the original timber veneer partitioning remains in the general office space. Despite the loss of some of its integrity the building is still an indicator of the beginning of the stylistic influence of the European Modern Movement in Queensland. It is also prominent for the manner in which it is designed to take advantage of its location on a corner site.  Heritage listing  The Queensland Brewery Company Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The building is significant as a relatively rare example of a landmark building with Art Deco embellishments.

It is an episode in Act 3 of Giacomo Meyerbeer's grand opera, Robert le diable. It was first performed in November 1831 at the Paris Op√©ra. The choreography (now lost) was created by Filippo Taglioni. Jean Coralli may have choreographed the entry of the nuns. The short ballet tells of deceased nuns rising from their tombs in a ruined cloister. Their aim is to seduce the knight, Robert le Diable, into accepting a talisman to win him a princess. At the end of the ballet, the white-clad nuns return to their tombs. The ballet was created (in part) to demonstrate the building's newly installed gas lighting. The lighting was capable of creating ghastly effects. Ballet of the Nuns starred Marie Taglioni as the Abbess Helena. Although opening night was marred with a few mishaps, Taglioni made her indelible mark on the ballet world in the role. She became known for her ethereal qualities and her moral purity, and is one of the most celebrated ballerinas in history.  Story  The ballet opens with Bertram, Robert le Diable's father, entering the ruined cloister of Sainte-Rosalie. He summons the ghosts of nuns who have violated their vows. They rise from their graves. He orders them to seduce his son Robert into accepting a deadly talisman. The Abbess Helena orders the ghosts to waltz. In spite of their sacred vows, the nuns waltz. The dead nuns give themselves over to unholy thrills. Robert enters. The nuns hide, but return to prevent his escape. Robert stands terrified before a saint's tomb. The Abbess lures him towards the talisman in the saint's hand. Robert seizes it. The nuns continue their dance, fluttering like white moths. Their graves open and they sink into the earth. Stone slabs slide into place, covering the dead. A choir of demons is heard.  Background  Ballet of the 18th century was based on rational thought and classical art. The French Revolution however ushered in a period that brought romantic ballet to the stage. Trapdoors, gas lighting, and other elements that became associated with the romantic ballet had been used in the popular theaters on the Paris boulevards for some time. Such elements would gain official sanction and prestige at the Paris Op√©ra in the middle decades of the 19th century. Jean Coralli, date unknown A ballet on a Robert le Diable theme was danced in Paris before Her Highness Mlle de Longueville in 1652. Ballet of the Nuns however was something entirely new in concept to audiences on the ballet's opening night. Henri Duponchel, managing director of the Paris Op√©ra, was in charge of visual effects at the Op√©ra. He wanted to demonstrate the venue's recently installed gas lighting. Its reflectors produced a stronger, more keenly directed light than ever before. Working with him was Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri, chief scenery designer. Ciceri was inspired by either the Saint-Trophime cloister in Arles or the cloister of Monfort-l'Amaury for the ballet's moonlit setting. The theme of the ballet is passion and death, and love beyond the grave. The scene is night rather than day, and Gothic Europe rather than the classical world of Greece and Rome. After almost 100 years of rational thought, audiences were clamoring for the mysterious, the supernatural, the vague, and the doomed. The story of the ballet is about a knight who slips into a cloister at midnight to steal a talisman from a dead saint's hand that will allow him to win a princess. Hans Christian Andersen included the scene in one of his novels. Andersen writes of the scene, \\"By the hundred they rise from the graveyard and drift into the cloister. They seem not to touch the earth. Like vaporous images, they glide past one another ... Suddenly their shrouds fall to the ground. They stand in all their voluptuous nakedness, and there begins a bacchanal.\\"Quoted in The nuns were not completely naked, but Andersen did capture the essence of the scene.  Opening night  Louis V√©ron Opening night was spoiled by a falling gaslight and a trapdoor that would not close properly. A piece of scenery fell, narrowly missing Taglioni. The curtain was brought down. The ballerina assured everyone she was unharmed. The curtain rose and the performance continued. It ended in a triumph for Meyerbeer, the Taglionis, and Dr. Louis V√©ron, the Op√©ra's new manager. Dr. V√©ron had recently been awarded the Paris Op√©ra as a private enterprise. He had great faith in Taglioni. He raised her salary to an unprecedented 30,000 francs a year. Her father was named ballet master with a three-year contract. V√©ron's boldness was rewarded when Taglioni fulfilled her promise and became a great star.  Reception  The audience took prurient delight in the scandalous Nuns. A reviewer for the Revue des Deux-Mondes wrote: > A crowd of mute shades glides though the arches. All these women cast off > their nuns' costume, they shake off the cold powder of the grave; suddenly > they throw themselves into the delights of their past life; they dance like > bacchantes, they play like lords, they drink like sappers. What a pleasure > to see these light women.Cited in Ballet of the Nuns at the Paris Op√©ra Nuns was the first ballet blanc and the first romantic ballet. The opera was performed 756 times between 1831 and 1893 at the Paris Op√©ra. French Impressionist painter Edgar Degas painted the ballet scene several times between 1871 and 1876. Under her contract, Taglioni was to appear in Nuns about a dozen times. She left after six. It is possible that the erotic implications of the nuns' ballet did not set well with her. She may have been reluctant to appear in a ballet within an opera. A foot injury and the accidents that marred the first performance may have given the ballerina pause for thought. Bad press directed at her father may have caused Taglioni to withdraw. Taglioni was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, who danced the role 232 times. The Danish choreographer August Bournonville saw Fitzjames's performance as the Abbess in Paris in 1841. He based his own choreography, which was used in Copenhagen between 1843 and 1863, on this. His choreography has been fully preserved. It represents the only record of the original. Ciceri's design for Ballet of the Nuns Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's future wife Fanny Appleton wrote, \\"The diabolical music and the dead rising from their tombs and the terrible darkness and the strange dance unite to form a stage effect almost unrivaled. The famous witches' (nuns) dance in the freezing moonlight in the ruined abbey, was as impressive as expected ... They drop in like flakes of snow and are certainly very charming witches with their jaunty Parisian figures and most refined pirouettes.\\" Critic and dance historian Andre Levinson writes, \\"The academic dance had been an agreeable exercise to watch. Now, [ballet] clarified matters of the soul. Ballet was a divertissement (an entertainment, a distraction). It became a mystery.\\" Quoted in Kisselgoff writes, \\"... the preoccupation with the supernatural that characterized so much of 19th-century ballet could be traced to the success of the Ballet of the Nuns in Meyerbeer's first production at the Paris Op√©ra\\".

The genus contains a single described species, Toxolabis zigrasi. History and classification Toxolabis is known from a group of fossils, the holotype, specimen number JZC-Bu231, along with two first instar nymphs which may be of the same species. The specimens have been preserved as inclusions in a single transparent chunk of Burmese amber. The age of the amber deposits in Kachin State in northernmost Burma are understood to be at least 100 million years old, placing them in the Albian age of the Cretaceous. As of 2014, Burmese amber has been radiometrically dated using U-Pb isotopes, yielding an age of approximately 99 million years old, close to the Aptian ‚Äì Cenomanian boundary. At the time of description, the amber specimen was residing in the private collection of James Zigras and only available for study through the American Museum of Natural History. The Toxolabis type specimen, recovered from amber bearing outcrops in Kachin State, was first studied by paleoentomologists Michael S. Engel of the Division of Entomology at the University of Kansas, and David Grimaldi of the American Museum of Natural History. Engel and Grimaldi's 2014 type description of the new species was published in the journal Novitates Paleoentomologicae. The genus name Toxolabis was coined by Engel and Grimaldi as a combination of Greek words labis, which means \\"forceps\\" and toxon meaning \\"bow\\", a reference to the shape of the cercal forceps. The specific epithet zigrasi in honor of James Zigras. T. zigrasi is one of six described earwig species found in Burmese amber. A second species, Zigrasolabis speciosa was also described by Engel and Grimaldi in the 2014 paper. Two species Astreptolabis ethirosomatia and Tytthodiplatys mecynocercus were described by Engel in the same 2011 paper, while Burmapygia resinata was described by Engel and David Grimaldi in 2004, with the last species Myrrholabia electrina first described by Theodore Cockerell in 1920. Description Male Toxolabis have an overall coloration that appears to be mat brown. They are approximately in length when the cerci are included, with a rather flattened body. The bodies are only sparsely covered in setae, which are not thickened enough to be chaetulose. The antennae have a slightly wide scape and are at least twelve flagellomeres (segments) long, though both of the holotypes' antennae are incomplete. As is typical with earwigs, the forewings have been modified into short tegma which cover most but not all of the first abdominal segment. The hind wings are present, but due to positioning of the tegma, are mostly obscured, though the tips extend beyond the tegma. The slender cerci are tubular and straight at the base, tapering along the length to sharp points at the ends, with an incurve starting just past the midpoint. Each of the cerci has several sparse setae on the middle portions.

Rubashkyn is a pharmacist, chemist and polyglot; Eliana currently works as a nicotine harm reduction scientist and develops campaigns of support addressed to LGBTI asylum seekers, refugees and intersex persons in New Zealand. Rubashkyn's gender was recognised under the United Nations' 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Rubashkyn's case attracted international media and legal attention after her mistreatment following her detention at Hong Kong International Airport because of the lack of congruence between her gender identity and her passport photo, resulting in several years of statelessness in Hong Kong, and inhumane reclusion into several refuge centers across Yuen Long. Personal life Rubashkyn was born in Colombia to a Ukrainian Jewish mother who had moved there in the 1970s. She was assigned and raised male but born with an intersex condition known as Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome. In 2011 Rubashkyn obtained her degree in pharmacy and chemistry at the National University of Colombia., after studying molecular biology in the University of Granada she was granted a scholarship to develop postgraduate studies in public health at the Taipei Medical University, and started at the same time her gender transition in Taiwan. Within a year, hormone replacement therapy changed Rubashkyn's physical appearance dramatically due to her intersex condition, and the Taiwanese immigration authorities required her to update her passport at the closest Colombian consulate before she could begin her second year of master's studies. She travelled to Hong Kong to do so, but when she arrived at Hong Kong International Airport's immigration facility, she was detained for over eight months in several detention and refugee centres because of her ambiguous legal condition. suffering from abusive mistreatment and constant sexual abuse and harassment in several of the reclusion centres she lived. She was also restrained in a psychiatric ward of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Kowloon, caused by an attempted suicide, after being constantly mistreated and sexually abused. Unable to seek asylum to be granted protection as a refugee in Hong Kong due to that government not having ratified the UN Refugee Convention, she faced deportation, and suffered severe mistreatment in the airport's detention centre. Rubashkyn currently lives in Auckland, New Zealand, where she was eventually granted asylum as a refugee. Rubashkyn learned many languages fluently in the refugee centers she lived during 2012, 2013 and 2014. She remained stateless until 3 April 2018, when she was granted with New Zealand citizenship based on her exceptional circumstances =Statelessness= In 2013, the UN sought another country to resettle Eliana because of the lack of protections for LGBT people and refugees in Hong Kong. She refused to contact her home embassy to prevent deportation because of the lack of diplomatic assistance they offered and Eliana became stateless de facto from 30 October 2012. Eliana's position as a refugee limited the contact she could have with authorities from the governments of Colombia. =Marriage= On 2 June 2015, Rubashkyn was married in New Zealand to an Israeli man named Itamar. The NZ Registrar of Marriages caused some controversy in relation to the solemnisation of her marriage when, in addition to her present legal name, they asked for her dead name to register the marriage.  International response  With the help of Amnesty International and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), she was granted refugee status. However, because Hong Kong is not a signatory of the 1951 refugee convention, it did not recognise her as a refugee and sought to deport her to Colombia. Her case drew international attention, particularly in Southeast Asia and Colombia, where transgender and intersex people are often persecuted. Her case was also noted in New Zealand, a country known for its stance on equality for LGBT people. On 16 December 2013, the UN passed a resolution recognising Rubashkyn as woman under the UNHCR refugee system. She became the first gender diverse person recognised as a woman in China or Hong Kong without having undergone a sex reassignment surgery. In May 2014, New Zealand accepted Rubashkyn as a refugee and granted her asylum, extending a universal recognition of her gender. Her case was the first in the world in which the gender identity of a person was recognised internationally. A CNN story about her struggle and a short documentary about her life in Hong Kong won a GLAAD Media Award in May 2015.  New Zealand citizenship  After six years of statelessness in April 2018, the government of New Zealand on behalf of the Ministry of Internal Affairs granted the New Zealand citizenship based on her exceptional and unique circumstances.

It was officially allowed to re-register as a national party in 2017, but once again failed to obtain the minimum number of votes nationally in the 2018 elections, and was dissolved. Creation The Humanist Party was founded in 2013 and established in 2014. It was created by affiliates of both the PRI and PAN as a centralist party. It wanted people to be represented and a lack of extremism. Ideology The Humanist Party was a centralist party and defined itself as a ‚Äúcross-organization without extremism,‚Äù . With its background in both conservative and liberal parties, it was able to embrace both sides, while keeping their pragmatic, agrarian views. The party was known to be pragmatic and wanted what was best for the nation. With agriculture as their main platform, the Humanists were seen looking to resources and weighing options; usually choosing the best option for the nation. Dissolution The Humanist Party suffered the same fate of many small parties in the Mexican political system. In 2015, it was unable to reach the number of votes to keep it as a national party, but it did get enough to remain a regional party. The Humanist Party re-registered as a national party in 2017, but once again, failed to reach its required number of national votes. The Humanist Party was dissolved in 2018.

The church grounds was consecrated on 29 November 1830 by Bishop Turner of Calcutta, (p. 327) and the building was completed in 1832. The church is named after Saint Bartholomew, one of the 12 apostles of Jesus Christ, and is said to have visited India in the first century AD, and preached the Christian gospel in the Kalyan, Thane and Raigad regions of present-day Maharashtra. The church services at the St. Bartholomew's Church are conducted in English. History St. Bartholomew's Church is amongst the oldest churches in Mysore and was established to serve the Christian congregations of the European officers under the service of the Maharaja of Mysore and the British Resident of Mysore. The land for the church was gifted by Krishnaraja Wadiyar III (1799-1868), and continued to be patronised by the successive Wadiyar rulers of Mysore. The then British Resident of Mysore, Arthur Henry Cole (1780‚Äì1844) (after whom Coles Park in Fraser Town, Bangalore is named) paid an important role in getting the support of the Maharaja of Mysore for the construction of St. Bartholomew's Church. The cost of construction of the St. Bartholomew's Church was INR 3,500, which was borne by the European military officers and civilians of the congregation. In 1847, the St. Bartholomew's Church got affiliated to the Anglican denomination. In 1852, the church was handed over the Government of Madras. The church was involved in schooling the children of European officers, offering English Education, when no other English medium school existed in Bangalore or Mysore. The 175th anniversary of the St. Bartholomew's Church was celebrated in August 2005, on a grand scale. Bell Tower The bell tower of St. Bartholomew's Church is constructed separately, away from the church building. The Stone inscription reads that the bell was originally cast in France in the mid 17th century for the use of French army base church in French Rocks, Erode village (now Pandavapura) near Srirangapatna. After the defeat of Tippu Sultan in 1799, by the British India Army, the area came under British Control, consequently handed back to the Wadiyars. In 1924, the old French church was dismantled to build Irwin Canal (now Visvesvaraya Canal). The bell along with few other remnants of the church was handed over to chaplin Rev. G A A Wright of St Bartholomew‚Äôs Church. The Bell tower was moved from the rear of the church to the front in 2002, and re-dedicated by the then Bishop, Rev. Dr. C L Furtado, Bishop of Church of South India, Karnataka Southern Diocesan, in the presence of the then presbyter-in-charge Rev. Premkumar Soans. Architecture St. Bartholomew's Church is well known for its beautiful marble altar. Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV donated the expenses towards the stained glasses and teakwood paneling. In 1930, to mark the centenary celebrations, Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV donated towards a stained glass depicting St. Bartholomew, which was unveiled by Lady Wellington. The church is single storied, with a simple, yet attractive architecture. The architect of the church is unknown.

The Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII also visited the church in 1921. The visit of the Prince of Wales (later King George V) also resulted in many projects such as construction of rows of storehouses on Sayyaji Rao Road, opposite to the Devaraja Market, and sprucing up of the Purnaiaya Nala running from the Lansdowne Building to the railway level crossing near Jodi Thengina Mara, in honour of the visiting dignitaries. Memorial inscriptions The church has a memorial inscription for Francis Lewis (died 1861), erected by his widow and children, describing it as a memorial for his piousness and missionary zeal in establishing the St. Bartholomew's Church at Mysore. There are also memorial inscriptions for Lt.Col. T M McHutchin (died 1873), Lt. Col.

The film stars Sam Rockwell, Amy Ryan, Jemaine Clement, Danny McBride, and Will Forte. The film was released in a limited release and through video on demand on December 11, 2015, by Lionsgate Premiere. Plot Don Verdean (Sam Rockwell) is a Biblical Archaeologist who searches for items that can prove that the stories from the Bible are true. The film opens to what seems to be an old VHS tape showing Verdean's archaeological achievements, all of which have no substantial proof and are based on anecdotal evidence. It cuts to Verdean at a church giving a lecture on his iron shears which he believes were used to cut Samson's hair. A man stands up and reads a letter from the Israeli Antiquities Authority that states that Verdean had no legal authority to be excavating in Israel, that his actions were illegal, and any archaeological findings should be published in professional journals. Verdean responds by saying Satan is at work and the Israelis are covering up the truth to prevent a bloodbath. Verdean proceeds to open his book to a page with him and another man. The other man he claims to be Nahum Ishalom, the spokesman for the Israeli Antiquities and author of the letter that the man just read. This causes the congregation to start clapping, including the man who read the letter but he still seemed skeptical. Afterwards at the meet and greet in the Church's lobby a man hands his assistant Carol Jensen (Amy Ryan) a business card from Tony Lazarus (Danny McBride) and says Lazarus wants to meet Verdean. Carol informs Verdean that Lazarus wants to meet him as they are loading their wares into their RV. Verdean tells Carol about Lazarus's conversion from being a sinner who was driving with a hooker when he got into a car accident and died 10 years prior, with Verdean stating Lazarus's soul left his body. Verdean then states God sent him back like a modern-day Lazarus of Bethany. Lazarus then married the hooker and they started their own ministry. The next morning Verdean meets Lazarus at his Church where Lazarus introduces his wife Joylinda Lazarus (Leslie Bibb). Lazarus informs Verdean that Church attendance has been down and Lazarus needs a boost because of a new neighboring Church ran by an ex- Satanist that is taking all his parishioners. Verdean tells Lazarus he has found a salt statue of Lot's wife and Lazarus wants it. Verdean calls Boaz (Jemaine Clement) who is in Israel and tells him he needs him to ship the statue to him in the United States. Boaz has forgotten where it is but says he will find it and hangs up the phone. The shipment arrives but when they open the box, the statue inside looks like something with a penis. Everyone looks surprised and Lazarus states it does not look like the picture that Verdean had shown him. Verdean states that Lot's wife must have been a hermaphrodite which explains why she did not want to leave Sodom. Lazarus buys this but Verdean calls Boaz, extremely upset, and demands that Boaz send him the statue he had shown him earlier. Lazarus unveils the statue to a bewildered audience when a man stands up and claps. After the sermon Pastor Fontaine (Will Forte) shows up and asks to carbon date the statue, which Verdean declines stating that carbon dating is not reliable and Fontaine leaves. It cuts to Verdean and Carol at a diner eating and Carol tells Verdean about her son, who is in prison for growing marijuana. Later Lazarus tells Verdean he wants more artifacts. Verdean says he can find Goliath's skull and Lazarus thinks this is a great idea. Verdean and Carol fly to Israel where they meet Boaz and start digging for the skull. Israeli Police show up and start yelling at them in Hebrew which Boaz attempts to translate. The police officer states that they need a permit to dig and if they do not fill the hole in they are all going to jail. Later, Verdean is speaking with Lazarus over the phone and Lazarus tells Verdean he needs the skull as soon as possible. Verdean then decides to steal the skull of a dead Israeli with gigantism, by the name of Jonny Jerusalem, from his grave. Verdean then knocks out a rock sized hole in the front of the skull and tries to pass it off as being Goliath's skull by burying it out in the desert. The next day he brings Carol and Boaz to the spot where he buried it the night before. A man from a tour bus sees them dig it up and starts recording them and claiming it was Goliath's skull. Back at the hotel, Boaz confronts Verdean about the unlikelihood of them finding that so quickly. Boaz then sees Johnny Jerusalem on Verdean's laptop and accuses him of being a grave robber. Verdean bribes Boaz to keep his mouth shut and takes Boaz with him to the United States. Boaz keeps blackmailing Verdean in order to get Verdean to do what he wants, including the request for a night with Carol. Verdean asks Carol to meet up with Boaz because Boaz wants to convert to Christianity and they set up a date. Boaz picks up Carol for their date, precedes to ask her questions about the type of men she likes, and asks her to dance. After Boaz says inappropriate things about Carol's son, Carol slaps Boaz and storms out with Boaz yelling that Verdean promised him a night with her. Carol, upset with Verdean, tell Verdean that she quits. Verdean then goes to the dance club and punches Boaz in the face, knocking him onto the ground. The next day they go to meet the man who Boaz hired, but has not paid, to falsify the lab results on Goliath's fake skull. Not having the $10,000, Boaz pulls a gun on the guy, kidnaps him, and they lock him in a storage locker. Verdean and Boaz start trying to create a fake Holy Grail in order to try and fool a Chinese Christian billionaire who they are trying to con 1 million dollars out of. After several failed attempts, they steal a chalice from an antiques store. Verdean and Boaz pickup Poon-Yen (Steve Park) at the airport and board a helicopter, heading to the \\"secret\\" location of the Holy Grail. They land wearing bulletproof vests and take Poon-Yen through some caverns until they reach their fake Holy Grail, which greatly impresses Poon-Yen who believes the farce. Poon-Yen is accidentally shot and they all end up at the hospital where Boaz pulls a gun on them and steals the briefcase of money from Poon-Yen's associate who is sitting next to Poon-Yen in the hospital bed. Verdean tackles Boaz and then the briefcase starts to vibrate while they are wrestling on the ground. Inside the briefcase was a cell phone that Pastor Fontaine was calling and leaves a message saying the cops found the kidnapped lab technician with a GPS tracker Fontaine placed on Verdean and Boaz's car. Verdean and Boaz escape after taking off the GPS tracker and are pursued by the police. Boaz is captured and arrested while Fontaine taunts him as he is placed into custody and drives away. The cops then find Verdean at Carol's house confessing and apologizing to her for his crimes. The police take Verdean away and it cuts to 2 months later. A news woman is outside Fontaine's Church questioning him about misappropriation of Church funds in order to setup Verdean. Verdean was convicted of fraud, larceny, aggravated assault, and accessory to kidnapping. Verdean and Boaz end up in prison together and talk in the yard. Verdean notices a young man sitting alone at a table during dinner and asks if he has a mother named Carol, to which he replies \\"Yes\\". Verdean pats him on the shoulder before it cuts to the credits.

The protest consisted of shutting down business and industrial establishments as a form of hartal which allowed them to stop paying tax without it being illegal. The protest was led by the very mayor of the city, Dr. Bartomeu Robert. The shutting of the cashboxes was caused by the colonial crisis of 1898, which led the Spanish government to impose some restrictive budgets along with an increase in taxation to compensate for the deficit. The protest was primarily against the corporate and personal income tax, and that on personal bonds, which had higher rates in Barcelona than in Madrid. That created a feeling of having been betrayed among the Catalan bourgeoisie, as they had fought alongside the dynastic parties. The board of the Industrial & Commercial League of Defense issued a call to protest. A Permanent Union Board was chosen, representing more than fifty Barcelona guilds. The government declared a state of emergency. The protest extended to Sabadell, Matar√≥, Manresa and Villafranca del Penedes, and some business- owners were arrested for not paying taxes.  Consequences  * the resignation of Barcelona mayor Doctor Robert (1842-1902) * the resignations of the Spanish government ministers Manuel Dur√°n i Bas (1823-1907) and Camilo Garcia of Polavieja and Castillo * the alienation of the Catalan middle class from the Spanish government and consequent strengthening of Catalan nationalism  References  Category:Protests in Spain Category:Tax resistance ","title":"Tancament de caixes"},{"id":"45288131","text":"Room Enough For All is the thirty-first album by Battlefield Band and their twenty-third studio album, released on the Temple Records label by mid-March 2013 in the USA & Canada in CD (to coincide with the band's tour) and in early April 2013 worldwide in CD & Digital Download formats.

History Fristrom was born a son of C. Fristr√∂m of Sweden, and may have come to Australia as a sailor. He worked for a time in Hutchison's Elite Photographic Studios in Queen Street, Brisbane before taking up painting as a full-time occupation. He was largely self-taught, but his second oil painting was of sufficient merit to be shown at the 1886 Brisbane Exhibition. He was, with L. W. K. Wirth, James Laurence Watts, and Walter Jenner, in 1888 a founding member of the Queensland Art Society. This led to R. Godfrey Rivers working for the foundation of the Queensland National Art Gallery. He left for Adelaide in September 1893, where he found employment with Fritz & Co. photographic studio, and in November was accepted as a member of the Adelaide Easel Club. While in Adelaide, Fristrom painted and sketched portraits of well-known Adelaide identity, Aboriginal man Poltpalingada Booboorowie. In August 1894 an exhibition of oil portraits by Fristrom was mounted at the \\"Easel Clubroom\\" at 62, Rundle Street in Adelaide. He returned to Brisbane in September 1894. The Society of Artists went into decline around 1901. In 1904 a new Society of Artists was formed; meetings were held in Fristrom's studio in \\"Oakden Chambers\\", Queen Street. Fristrom was its president at the time of his death, as well as a member of the advisory board of the Queensland National Art Gallery. Family Oscar married Caroline Rooke (1865 ‚Äì 17 July 1948) of Breakfast Creek, Queensland; in 1911 they settled at Mooloolah, Queensland, later moved to Caloundra, then 52 Wharf Street, Brisbane. She was well known as a musician and music teacher. They had two children: *Carl (25 March 1886 ‚Äì ) married Ruby May Rooke (his cousin?) on 20 August 1921. *Alma Christina (6 July 1889 ‚Äì 2 December 1943) married Samuel Burgess; they lived at Caloundra. Oscar had a brother Edward Fristr√∂m, also an artist in Brisbane, and from 1903 in New Zealand. He married Margaret Johnston of South Brisbane in July 1886; they had a daughter Olivia, a promising pianist, and a son. Another brother, Tage Edward Fristr√∂m, a member of the US Voluntary Infantry, was killed in 1898 fighting Spain in Manila. Dying on 26 June 1918, his funeral moved from the funeral parlour of John Hislop & Sons to the South Brisbane Cemetery.  Notable works  Bust of Augustus Charles Gregory sculpted by Oscar Fristrom in 1905 In 1905 Fristom sculpted a bust of Augustus Charles Gregory, an explorer and first Surveyor-General of Queensland. In February 1906, Fristrom offered to sell the bust to the Royal Geographical Society of Queensland but the society decided not to buy it; however, they did display it at an event in June 1906. For many years the bust was displayed at Freemasons‚Äô Gregory Lodge in Cairns (Gregory being depicted wearing his Masonic regalia). In 2018, the Freemasons donated the bust to the Museum of Lands, Mapping and Surveying in Brisbane. As at 10 March 2020, the bust is at the entrance of the museum.

The player utilizes Wolfson DAC and is capable of reproducing music sampled at 192kHz with a sample size of 24-bits per channel, and to function as a USB audio interface. The X3 is the mid-level member of the FiiO X Series of portable music players. It supports major lossy music formats, such as MP3 and lossless music formats such as FLAC. According to CNET it is affordable and \\"terrific sounding\\" music player. According to LA Times FiiO X3 is a better alternative to an iPod. The player received very positive reviews towards price/sound quality ratio, however it was criticized for inelegant interface and confusing placement of buttons.  Design and specifications  The player uses Wolfson WM8740 digital converter which is a \\"true audiophile-grade\\", according to CNET. The unit has a 2.4-inch TFT LCD display, 3100mAH lithium polymer battery for 10 hours play time and offers two 3.5mm analog stereo outputs, as well as 3.5mm coaxial digital outputs. It comes with 8GB of internal storage and includes an expansion slot for microSD cards for capacities of up to 128GB. It is enclosed in a black solid metal case and has nearly the same size as an iPod Classic. It comes with USB cable, coaxial adaptor, silicone case and screen protectors. It is being charged via micro USB.  Features  The player is capable of playing MP3 files as well as supports major formats such as FLAC, WAV, WMA, Monkey's Audio (APE), AAC, Ogg Vorbis and ALAC. The X3II also supports native dac. It is also possible to connect the player to a PC with Windows, Mac, Linux OSes and devices that offer USB On-the-go in order to function as USB DAC. FiiO X3 can drive both low- and high-impedance headphones: from 16 to 300 ohms. The player offers gapless playback, hardware (non DSP) bass and treble controls. It has a simple UI with a generic file browser. FiiO X3 will work with most major library managers such as Media Monkey, Windows own Media Player and Winamp.  Sound  LA Times wrote that sound quality the player produces has never been available at anything close to this price on any kind of player, including portable players. CNET wrote that high-resolution music 96 kHz and 192 kHz/24 FLAC sounded remarkable. \\"Bass definition firmed up, and after I spent a few hours with the X3 the iPod sounded rather bland and boring.\\" The sound on X3 was \\"more complete and realistic\\" than that of iPod and \\"it's a much better sounding player [than iPod classic]\\". Headfonics commented about the sound presentation: \\"is a nice warm laid back tonality with next to no background noise or hiss for sensitive earphones, a well defined mid section, good tight bass without being too dominant (you can EQ that if you wish) and a slightly rolled off treble.\\" The reviewer noted a hiss-free background. Hi-Fi World noted that FiiO X3 can potentially deliver better sound quality than any CD, as well as far better sound than portables like the iPod. According to their measurements that were performed at 3V through the headphone socket at high gain the X3 had \\"50% more output than most CD players, and ten times more output than most portables.\\" However, it was noted that music sounded better via external amplifier such as Audiolab Q-DAC comparing to internal amplifier of the X3. The magazine commented about playing hi-res music files: \\"conveys the intrinsic quality of high resolution digital audio files well.\\"  Reception  LA Times' music critic Mark Swed wrote in an article named \\"New audio player Fiio X3 tops the iPod, and is cheaper too\\" that it is a better alternative to an iPod and that X3 utilizes that same digital-to-analog converter that is found in much more expensive players, such as Astell & Kern models that are being sold for $699 and $1,299. In his opinion the FiiO X3 may not have A&K;‚Äôs sweet and open sound, but it cost $200 as of April, 2013. However, he noted that the X3 is \\"thicker and clunkier\\" than an iPod Touch. Steve Guttenberg of CNET in his article \\"FiiO's nifty $200 portable high- resolution music player is a knockout\\" wrote that it sounds sweet with MP3s and it is \\"192kHz/24-bit awesome music player\\". In his opinion the X3 \\"smashed the price barrier\\". He commented: \\"the FiiO X3 is the one to get if you, like me, have been waiting for a music player to take your sound to the next level.\\" He noted however, that X3 can't match the Classic's 160GB storage capability, as it offers only 8GB of memory, though it can be expanded with a memory card.

Its offices are located in the Pellissier Building above the Wiltern Theater in the Koreatown District of Los Angeles. Its name refers to the cultural concept of yiddishkayt, (Yiddish culture, literally \\"Jewishness\\" or \\"Yiddishness\\"), which the American Jewish critic Irving Howe described not in religious terms, but rather as a humanism based in a \\"readiness to live...beyond the clamor of self.\\" According to the Yiddishkayt website, the organization seeks to \\"inspire current and future generations with the artists, writers, musicians, performers, filmmakers, philosophers, and social justice activists whose yiddishkayt ‚Äî their particular form of critical and compassionate engagement with humanity ‚Äî emerged from the Jewish communities of Europe as they developed in constant contact with their non- Jewish neighbors.\\" Since its founding in 1995, Yiddishkayt has become the largest organization devoted to yiddishkayt west of the Hudson and has produced six Yiddish festivals, a high school Yiddish language education program, two cultural fellowships ‚Äî one for young adults and one for adults ages 50 and over ‚Äî 30 Los Angeles premiere, 16 US premiere and 5 world premiere presentations devoted to Yiddish culture, 10 cross-cultural performances, and partnerships with over 25 organizations and venues, including the Workmen's Circle, REDCAT, University of California, Los Angeles, Hollywood Forever Cemetery, and the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books. In 2009 and 2010, Yiddishkayt was named by Slingshot Fund as the \\"50 of the most innovative organizations in Jewish life today.\\" History and activities In 1995 cultural festival organizer Aaron Paley ‚Äî founder of Los Angeles nonprofits Community Arts Resources (CARS) and CicLAvia ‚Äî produced a one-day festival of Yiddish culture that attracted close to 6,000 people, launching Yiddishkayt Los Angeles as an organization. Until 2004, the organization's hallmark productions were the Yiddishkayt Festivals, comprising a one-day family festival with a week-long series of events. The first citywide Yiddishkayt Festival in 1998 featured 26 events in 19 venues, including many cross-cultural collaborations including a Klezmer-Mariachi commission and presentations at non-Jewish venues, such as the first reading of Yiddish at the Los Angeles Central Library. Yiddishkayt then expanded beyond the one-week festival model to a season of diverse, cultural programming including concerts, lectures, films and other events with artists, writers, filmmakers, musicians and academics pushing the boundaries of contemporary Yiddish culture. Examples of events produced by Yiddishkayt in the late 2000s include 2008‚Äôs \\"The ¬°Viva Yiddish! Project: The Yiddish-Latino Sound of Los Angeles\\" at California Plaza ‚Äî in partnership with Grand Performance and featuring members of LA's Ozomatli ‚Äî and 2009‚Äôs Doikayt: A Los Angeles Community-Wide Artist/Yiddish Passover Seder in partnership with the Jewish Artists Initiative (JAI). Yiddishkayt has also applied the principle of Doikayt through local history programming including tours of the neighborhood of Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, a historically multi-ethnic area that was once the hub of Los Angeles Yiddish cultural life. Stops on the tour have included the Breed Street Shul, the former Soto-Michigan Jewish Community Center, and Phillips Music Company, a store that served a diverse range of musicians including Mickey Katz, Los Lobos, and Thee Midniters. Aside from producing performances, festivals, and tours, Yiddishkayt has also worked on Yiddish language and cultural educational projects for both youth and adults. In December 2000, Yiddishkayt organized \\"The Art of Yiddish: Cultural Nourishment for a New Age,\\" a \\"two-week immersion in the living language.\\" Yiddish scholar Jeffrey Shandler has characterized Yiddishkayt's presentation of Yiddish culture and language as \\"nature and nurture, art and science, as well as old and new, local and exotic, singular and enduring, inscrutable and accessible.\\" In 2005, with major funding from the Steven Spielberg-founded Righteous Persons Foundation, Yiddishkayt embarked on a three-year pilot program to reintroduce Yiddish language and culture as a possible systematic course of instruction in American Jewish day schools, including the de Toledo High School. Since the early 2010s, under the directorship of Robert Adler Peckerar, Yiddishkayt's focus has shifted to occupy a more international and digital presence. The most significant venture has been the Helix Project, an immersive summer travel education program for university students. Since 2011, Yiddishkayt has taken groups of students on subsidized trips through the historic Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (modern-day Belarus, Poland, and Lithuania), a territory that was home to millions of Yiddish-speaking Litvaks and where Hebrew was recognized as an official language. The Helix Project is designed to immerse its participants in the multi-ethnic culture of Jewish Lithuania, and students visit notable sites in Eastern European Jewish cultural and political history, including the urban centers of Minsk, Grodno, Brest-Litovsk, Bia≈Çystok, and Vilnius, as well as places relevant to the lives of Yiddish cultural figures such as the poets Moyshe Kulbak and Abraham Sutzkever, the actor and director Solomon Mikhoels, anarchist thinker and activist Emma Goldman, and the members of the General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia. Accompanying the Helix students are scholars in the fields of Jewish language, literature, and history, as well as writers, musicians, and artists who incorporate Yiddish language and culture into their work. Since April, 2015 Yiddishkayt has run a similar trip for adults called \\"Yiddishkayt Expeditions\\". Activism and controversies In recent years, Yiddishkayt's leadership has been outspoken on Yiddish issues, especially the Los Angeles and broader American Jewish establishment's attitudes towards Yiddish culture. While leading a tour of Jewish Boyle Heights in 2006, Yiddishkayt founder Aaron Paley discovered that the historic Soto-Michigan Jewish Community Center had been demolished without Boyle Heights community leaders or Jewish historical activists being notified. In the LA Times, Paley denounced the demolition and its consequences for Boyle Heights' historical memory, calling the community center \\"a place where multicultural politics began.\\" In May, 2013, Yiddishkayt Executive Director Robert Adler Peckerar published an open letter on the organization's website lamenting the \\"state of Jewish philanthropy\\" in the wake of his attempts to fundraise for the Helix Project. According to Adler Peckerar, his solicitations were met on multiple occasions with criticisms that the trip did not feature \\"enough death,\\" did not visit Israel, and was open to non-Jewish students. Additionally, a Jewish studies scholar was quoted in a Los Angeles Times article as saying that the Helix Project's focus on the role of secular yiddishkayt in historical Jewish identity was \\"just stupid\\" and an \\"attempt to rewrite Jewish history.\\" Also in 2013, the Los Angeles Times published a story documenting Adler Peckerar's discovery of the dilapidated Mount Zion Cemetery in East Los Angeles and the grave of the Yiddish writer Lamed Shapiro. Following the article's publication, Los Angeles philanthropist Shlomo Rechnitz donated $250,000 towards the cemetery's restoration, a project undertaken by a rabbi from Chabad of Downtown Los Angeles. In a blog post on the Yiddishkayt website, Adler Peckerar criticized the restoration efforts on the part of Chabad and the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles, especially given the leftist politics and secularism of Lamed Shapiro and many other Los Angeles Jews interred at Mount Zion. \\"Rather than to look at what a neglected cemetery might tell us about a community‚Äôs relationship to its past or reconsider the disregard shown to its once-distinguished cultural icons,\\" Adler Peckerar wrote. \\"The immediate reaction was to cover our collective shame and get renovations started.\\" References Category:Jewish organizations based in the United States ","title":"Yiddishkayt (organization)"},{"id":"45288332","text":"Mikel Parial, born September 29, 1972, is a Filipino painter, photographer, and printmaker.

The subject became increasingly prominent in U.S. politics following the 1993 Hawaii Supreme Court decision in Baehr v. Miike that suggested the possibility that the state's prohibition might be unconstitutional. That decision was met by actions at both the federal and state level to restrict marriage to male- female couples, notably the enactment at the federal level of the Defense of Marriage Act. The first legal same-sex marriage ceremony in the United States happened on February 12, 2004, when the mayor of San Francisco, Gavin Newsom, ordered city hall to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. This decision resulted in the celebration of the first gay marriage in the United States, when Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon became the first gay couple to tie the knot and get official recognition of their fifty year relationship (Marriage Equality New York). On May 17, 2004, Massachusetts became the first U.S. state and the sixth jurisdiction in the world to legalize same-sex marriage following the Supreme Judicial Court's decision in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health six months earlier. Just as with the Hawaii decision, the legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts provoked a reaction from opponents of same-sex marriage that resulted in further legal restrictions being written into state statutes and constitutions. The movement to obtain marriage rights for same-sex couples expanded steadily from that time until in late 2014 lawsuits had been brought in every state that still denied marriage licenses to same-sex couples. By late 2014, same-sex marriage had become legal in states that contained more than 70% of the United States population. In some jurisdictions legalization came through the action of state courts or the enactment of state legislation. More frequently it came as the result of the decisions of federal courts. On November 6, 2012, Maine, Maryland, and Washington became the first states to legalize same-sex marriage through popular vote. Same-sex marriage has been legalized in the District of Columbia and 21 Native American tribal nations as well. The June 2013 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Windsor striking down the law barring federal recognition of same-sex marriage gave significant impetus to the progress of lawsuits that challenged state bans on same-sex marriage in federal court. Since that decision, with only a few exceptions, U.S. District Courts and Courts of Appeals have found state bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, as have several state courts. The exceptions have been a state court in Tennessee, U.S. district courts in Louisiana and Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear appeals from that circuit's decision. On June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down all state bans on same-sex marriage, legalized it in all fifty states, and required states to honor out-of-state same-sex marriage licenses in the case Obergefell v. Hodges. Early years Historical documents do record numerous examples of same-sex couples living in relationships that functioned as marriages even if they could not be legally sanctified as such.\\"The improbable, 200-year-old story of one of America‚Äôs first same-sex ‚Äòmarriages‚Äô\\". Washington Post, March 20, 2015. Historian Rachel Hope Cleves documents one such relationship, that of 19th-century Vermont residents Charity Bryant and Sylvia Drake, in her 2014 book Charity and Sylvia: A Same-Sex Marriage in Early America. Same-sex marriage was, however, rarely mentioned or recognized as a political issue before the 1970s. In August 1953, officials of the U.S Post Office delayed delivery of that month's issue of ONE magazine, with the cover story \\"Homosexual Marriage?\\", for three weeks while they tried to determine whether its contents were obscene. Few mentions of the subject have been documented in the decades that followed. In June 1971, members of the Gay Activists Alliance demanded marriage rights for same-sex couples at New York City's Marriage License Bureau. The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled in October 1971 that Minnesota's laws prohibiting marriages between same-sex partners did not violate the federal constitution. In October 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to consider the case, Baker v. Nelson, \\"for want of a substantial federal question.\\" Baker set federal precedent that blocked federal courts from ruling on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage for decades. The next year, the National Coalition of Gay Organizations called for the repeal of all statutes limiting marriage to different-sex couples and for extending the legal benefits of marriage to all cohabiting couples. Several states enacted bans on same-sex marriage in the late 1970s as well, including Virginia in 1975, and Florida, California, and Wyoming in 1977. =Activist debate= In the late 1980s, activists debated whether marriage rights should be at the forefront of the broader campaign for LGBT equality. Some of the oldest groups saw marriage as a contradiction of the radical origins of the gay rights movement in the sexual liberation movement of the 1960s. Others raised the tactical objection that a step-by step campaign that focused on near-term potential victories like anti- discrimination statutes stood a greater chance of long term success. In 1989, as a contribution to this debate, Andrew Sullivan's essay \\"Here Comes the Groom: A (Conservative) Case for Gay Marriage\\" appeared in the New Republic. In late 1993, Bruce Bawer in A Place at the Table contended using traditional moral arguments that same-sex relationships merit legal and religious recognition as marriages. He identified himself as part of a \\"silent majority\\" of non-radicals unrepresented in media depictions of gay and lesbian life and criticized the gay community for identifying homosexuality with sexual behavior. The issue of marriage had enough appeal within the gay and lesbian community that in April 1993, as part of the demonstrations surrounding the gay rights march in Washington, D.C., about 1,500 same-sex couples staged a mass wedding ceremony with \\"a dozen ministers, organ music, photographers and rice\\" at the National Museum of Natural History to call for marriage rights for gays and lesbians. =Hawaii and reaction= The Hawaii case of Baehr v. Miike attracted national attention when the Hawaii Supreme Court on May 5, 1993, ordered a trial court to consider whether the state could demonstrate that denying marriage licenses to same-sex couples \\"furthers compelling state interests and is narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgments of constitutional rights.\\"Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 852 P.2d 44 (1993), reconsideration and clarification granted in part, 74 Haw. 645, 852 P.2d 74 (1993) Congressional reaction to that ruling, partly in anticipation of the approaching presidential election, resulted in the enactment of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which denied federal recognition of same-sex marriages. President Bill Clinton signed it into law on September 21, 1996. In November 1998, Hawaii voters approved a state constitutional amendment allowing their legislature to ban same-sex marriage, and Alaska voters approved a state constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. =Lawrence v. Texas= In parallel with the campaign for same-sex marriage, LGBT civil rights gained legal recognition. In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Texas' \\"Homosexual Conduct\\" law in Lawrence v. Texas. The ruling rendered same-sex sodomy laws in Kansas, Oklahoma and Missouri and broader sodomy laws in nine other states unenforceable. Massachusetts and reactions On November 18, 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health that denying marriage rights to same-sex couples violated the Massachusetts Constitution. Massachusetts became the first United States jurisdiction to license and recognize same-sex marriages beginning May 17, 2004. In February and March 2004, city officials in San Francisco issued marriage licenses to about 4000 same-sex couples before being ordered to stop by the California Supreme Court. On February 20, 2004, the clerk in Sandoval County, New Mexico, issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples for a day until the state attorney general issued an opinion that they were \\"invalid under state law\\". Similar actions occurred in New Paltz, New York (February 27); Multnomah County, Oregon (March 3); and Asbury Park, New Jersey (March 8). On November 2, 2004, voters in eleven states‚ÄìArkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Utah‚Äìapproved state constitutional amendments defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. Kansas did so on April 5, 2005, as did Texas voters on November 8 of that year. The adverse reactions continued in 2006. Alabama voters approved a state constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman on June 6. Voters in Colorado, Idaho, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin adopted similar amendments on election day, November 7. The only exception that day was Arizona, where voters rejected an initiative banning the recognition same-sex marriages and civil unions. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger twice vetoed legislation that would have made same-sex marriage legal there, in September 2005 and October 2007. 2008 =Decision and reversal in California= On May 15, 2008, the Supreme Court of California issued a decision that legalized same-sex marriage in California, holding that California's existing opposite-sex definition of marriage violated the constitutional rights of same-sex couples. To overturn the decision, opponents of same-sex marriage placed a state constitutional amendment on the November ballot. Known as Proposition 8, it passed in November 2008, ending the licensing and recognition of same-sex marriages in California after less than six months. In two more states, Arizona and Florida, voters approved constitutional amendments defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. =Court ruling: Connecticut= On October 10, 2008, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that the state's civil unions statute discriminated against same-sex couples and required the state to recognize same-sex marriages. On November 12, 2008, the first marriage licenses to same-sex couples were issued and the following year, the state enacted gender-neutral marriage legislation. =National political parties= In August and September, the national political parties addressed same-sex marriage in their party platforms. The Democratic National Convention adopted a platform that \\"oppose[s]the Defense of Marriage Act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us\\" and suggested support for same-sex marriage: \\"We support the full inclusion of all families, including same-sex couples, in the life of our nation, and support equal responsibility, benefits, and protections.\\" The Republican National Convention platform said that judges are \\"undermining traditional marriage laws\\", endorsed the Federal Marriage Amendment and state initiatives that support \\"traditional marriage\\", and referenced \\"the right of states not to recognize same-sex 'marriages'\\". 2009 =Court decision: Iowa= On April 3, 2009, a unanimous Iowa Supreme Court ruling upheld a lower court ruling in Varnum v. Brien that denying marriage rights to same-sex couples violated the state constitution, and licenses became available on April 27. In the next judicial retention elections in November 2010, Iowa voters removed three of the justices that participated in the Varnum decision, following a campaign by groups opposed to same-sex marriage including the National Organization for Marriage. =Legislation: Vermont, New Hampshire, District of Columbia= On April 7, 2009, Vermont legalized same-sex marriage through legislation. The Governor of Vermont had previously vetoed the measure, but the veto was overridden by the Legislature. Vermont was the first state in the United States to legalize same-sex marriage through legislative means rather than litigation. On June 3, 2009, New Hampshire by enacting legislation became the sixth state to legalize same-sex marriage, effective January 1, 2010. On December 18, 2009, the Council of the District of Columbia enacted legislation legalizing same-sex marriage and same-sex marriage licenses became available on March 3, 2010. =Enactment and reversal in Maine= On May 6, 2009, Maine Governor John Baldacci signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage, becoming the first state governor to do so. Nonetheless, the legislation was stayed pending a vote and never went into effect. It was repealed by referendum in November 2009. =Respect for Marriage Act= In September 2009, several Democratic members of Congress proposed legislation to repeal DOMA. Barney Frank opposed the move because he thought its enactment impossible. Nancy Pelosi had warned earlier in the year that the legislative calendar had no room for the issue. 2010 , 29 states had constitutional provisions restricting marriage to one man and one woman, while 12 others had statutes that did so. Nineteen states banned any legal recognition of same-sex unions that would be equivalent to civil marriage.Statewide Marriage Prohibitions and Kansas Constitution, Article Fifteen Voters had approved 28 out of 30 popular referenda in which states asked voters to adopt a constitutional amendment or initiative defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman. Arizonans voted down one such amendment in 2006, but approved a different amendment to that effect in 2008. 2011 =Legislation: New York= On June 24, 2011, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the state's Marriage Equality Act into law. It took effect a month later. 2012 =Legislation: Washington, Maryland= Washington Governor Christine Gregoire signed same-sex marriage legislation into law on February 13, 2012. Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley did the same on March 1. =National politics= The Republican National Convention approved a platform that asserts the right of the federal government and each state to deny legal recognition to same-sex marriages and endorsed a constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. The Democratic National Convention adopted a political platform that supported marriage equality for the first time in its history and opposed all constitutional amendments that would exclude same-sex couples from marriage. =Balloting results= On May 8, 2012, North Carolina voters approved a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage as well as all other types of same-sex unions. In the regular November 2012 elections, voters for the first time approved the legalization of same-sex marriage by popular vote in three states: Maine, Maryland, and Washington. Maine's law took effect on December 29, 2012. Maryland started allowing same-sex marriages on January 1, 2013, In Washington state, the first licenses were distributed on December 6, with the first marriages on December 9 following the mandatory three-day waiting period.The Seattle Times: Lornet Turnbull, \\"Gregoire signs gay marriage into law,\\" February 13, 2012 . Retrieved February 13, 2012 In the same election, Minnesota rejected a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. 2013 =United States v. Windsor= On June 26, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a 5‚Äì4 decision in United States v. Windsor, ruling Section 3 of DOMA unconstitutional \\"as a deprivation of the equal liberty ... protected by the Fifth Amendment.\\" The decision was widely quoted by both sides in same-sex marriage lawsuits. =Court rulings: California, New Jersey, New Mexico= On August 4, 2010, a decision by a U.S. District Court in Perry v. Schwarzenegger ruled that California's Proposition 8 was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court dismissed the case for lack of standing on June 26, 2013, after which the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples resumed on June 28, 2013. New Jersey began issuing same-sex marriage licenses on October 21, 2013, following a September 27 state superior court decision that found an equal protection right of same-sex couples to marry. It reasoned that with the U.S. Supreme Court's recent action in United States v. Windsor, couples in New Jersey civil unions lacked access to federal benefits they could now receive if married. Governor Chris Christie, who had vetoed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage in February 2012, filed an appeal to the New Jersey Supreme Court, but withdrew it after the court refused to stay the lower court's ruling. Eight New Mexico counties, either on the basis of a court decision or their clerks' own volition, began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in August 2013. On December 19, 2013, the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled unanimously that same-sex marriage would be permitted throughout the state, effective immediately. =State legislation: Rhode Island, Delaware, Minnesota, Hawaii, Illinois= Several jurisdictions enacted same-sex marriage in 2013. Rhode Island enacted legislation on May 2, which took effect August 1; Delaware enacted legislation on May 7, which took effect July 1; and Minnesota enacted legislation on May 14, which took effect August 1. In October and November 2013, the Hawaii legislature enacted legislation legalizing same-sex marriage, which Governor Neil Abercrombie signed on November 13. The law took effect on December 2, 2013. Illinois Governor Pat Quinn signed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage on November 20, effective June 1, 2014, though in practice marriage licenses became widely available to same-sex couples in March. =Utah court ruling and subsequent stay= On December 20, 2013, U.S. District Court Judge Robert J. Shelby found Utah's same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional in Kitchen v. Herbert. Salt Lake County began issuing marriage licenses immediately, followed by other counties, until the state obtained a stay from the U.S. Supreme Court on January 6, 2014. 2014 On January 10, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the federal government would recognize the marriages of same- sex couples who married in Utah between December 20, 2013, and January 6, 2014. =Court decisions: Oregon and Pennsylvania= On May 19, 2014, U.S. District Judge Michael J. McShane ruled in Geiger v. Kitzhaber that Oregon's voter-approved constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. He ordered marriages to begin immediately and Governor John Kitzhaber applauded the decision. The National Organization for Marriage sought without success to intervene to seek a stay and appeal the decision. On May 20, 2014, U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III struck down Pennsylvania's same-sex marriage ban in his ruling in Whitewood v. Wolf. Governor Tom Corbett said he would not appeal the court decision, allowing same-sex marriages to be licensed in Pennsylvania. One county clerk has tried repeatedly to intervene in the lawsuit until U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, Circuit Justice for the Third Circuit, denied the clerk's application for a stay on July 8, 2014, and the Third Circuit denied the clerk's petition to rehear her case for intervention on August 4, 2014. =Louisiana ban upheld= On September 3, District Judge Martin Feldman ruled against the plaintiff same-sex couples in Robicheaux v. Caldwell, upholding Louisiana's ban on same-sex marriage. It was the first decision of a federal court since the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Windsor in June 2013 to uphold the constitutionality of a state ban on same- sex marriage. =U.S. Supreme Court declines cases= On October 6, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take action on all five cases it had been asked to consider from appellate courts in the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits, allowing the circuit court decisions striking down marriage bans to stand.  States with cases at issue: Virginia, Indiana, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Utah  The Supreme Court's action allowed the decisions of the lower courts to take effect. It resulted in the prompt legalization of same-sex marriage in several states with cases at issue: *Fourth Circuit: Virginia *Seventh Circuit: Indiana and Wisconsin *Tenth Circuit: Oklahoma and Utah Other states in the affected circuits: Colorado, West Virginia, North Carolina, Wyoming, South Carolina, Kansas Same-sex marriage bans were expected to end in six other states in the three circuits affected by the Supreme Court's action.‚ÄìColorado, Kansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Wyoming‚Äìbut at first officials in South Carolina, Wyoming, and Kansas said they would continue to defend their states' bans. In Colorado, Attorney General John Suthers asked the Tenth Circuit to dismiss his appeal and lift its stay in Burns v. Hickenlooper. He asked the State Supreme Court to lift a stay preventing certain clerks from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Both courts lifted their stays on October 7, 2014, and Suthers ordered all county clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In West Virginia, on October 9, Governor Ray Tomblin announced he was ordering state agencies to act in compliance with the decision of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Bostic v Schaefer on the unconstitutionality of same-sex marriage bans. In North Carolina, District Court Judge Max O. Cogburn, Jr., ruling in General Synod of the United Church of Christ v. Cooper on October 10, 2014, struck down North Carolina's ban on same-sex marriage, citing the Fourth Circuit's ruling in Bostic v. Schaefer. Some North Carolina clerks began issuing marriage license to same-sex couple immediately. In Wyoming, on October 17, U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl ruled for the plaintiff same- sex couples in Guzzo v. Mead, but stayed enforcement of his ruling until October 23 or until the defendants informed the court that they will not appeal to the Tenth Circuit. The stay was lifted on October 21 when the state notified the court it would not appeal, ending enforcement of Wyoming's ban on same-sex marriage. In South Carolina, on November 12, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Gergel ruled South Carolina's ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional in Condon v. Haley. He issued a temporary stay of his ruling, which took effect on November 20 after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to extend it. As of February 2015, Kansas remains the only state in the circuits affected by the Supreme Court's October 6 refusal to grant cert to continue to enforce in large measure its denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples. Many judges of the state's district courts issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Some began doing so based on their reading of Tenth Circuit precedent, others a few weeks later on the basis on a ruling against Kansas' ban on same-sex marriage issued on November 4, 2014, by U.S. District Judge Daniel D. Crabtree in Marie v. Moser, following Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt's failure to win a stay of that ruling from the Tenth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. A Kansas Supreme Court decision in a state case, State v. Moriarty, affirmed the right of a circuit judge to determine the validity of the state's ban. The state contends that it need only recognize licenses issued in the two counties whose officials were named in the federal lawsuit and subject to the order issued in that case. =Ninth Circuit decision= States with cases at issue On October 7, 2014, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in two cases, overturning a district court in Nevada that had found that state's ban on same-sex marriage constitutional and affirming the decision of a district court in Idaho that had found that state's ban unconstitutional. Following precedent in that circuit, it reviewed the states' bans against a higher standard than used by other courts, \\"heightened scrutiny\\". Idaho Governor Butch Otter announced the state would no longer attempt to preserve the state's denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples, though he continued without success to seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court. On October 13, 2014, the Ninth Circuit lifted the stay it had imposed in Latta v. Otter, allowing the district court decision to take effect, preventing further enforcement of Idaho's ban on same-sex marriage as of October 15, 2014. Other states in the Ninth Circuit: Alaska, Arizona, and Montana *Alaska. On October 12, 2014, Judge Timothy M. Burgess ruled that Alaska's denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples was unconstitutional and issued an injunction to prevent state officials from continuing to enforce it. The head of the state Bureau of Vital Statistics said, \\"We expect our office will be busy tomorrow, (October 13) but we will make every effort to help customers as quickly as possible.\\" *Arizona. On October 17, 2014, U.S. District Judge John W. Sedwick declared Arizona's ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional and enjoined the state from enforcing its ban, effective immediately. Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne said the state would not appeal the ruling and instructed county clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. *Montana. On November 19, 2014, U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris ruled Montana's ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional in Rolando v. Fox, immediately legalizing same-sex marriage there =Sixth Circuit decision= On November 6, 2014, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in a 2-1 decision, upheld the same-sex marriage bans in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. The cases were: In Kentucky, on February 12, U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn declared Kentucky's refusal to recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions unconstitutional. On February 27, he ordered the state to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions, but the next day he stayed that order until March 20, and on March 19, he stayed it pending action by the Sixth Circuit. On July 1, a judge ruled in Love v. Beshear that Kentucky's refusal to license same-sex marriages was unconstitutional and stayed that ruling. In Michigan, on March 21, U.S. District Court Judge Bernard A. Friedman found Michigan's ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional. He did not stay enforcement of his decision. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette filed an emergency request with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals for a stay pending appeal. Hundreds of same-sex couples obtained marriage licenses and some married in Michigan on the morning of March 22 before the appeals court temporarily stayed enforcement of the ruling. On March 26, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder said the Sixth Circuit's stay meant that \\"the rights tied to these marriages are suspended\\". On January 15, 2015, U.S. District Judge Mark A. Goldsmith ruled in Caspar v. Snyder that Michigan must recognize the validity of more than 300 marriages of same-sex couples married the previous March in the time between a district court found the state's ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed that ruling. In Ohio In Tennessee The same-sex couples in all these cases asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review them, and the state officials in Kentucky, Michigan, and Ohio who had won in the Sixth Circuit endorsed those requests in order to have a Supreme Court ruling on the subject of same-sex marriage. =Decisions being appealed: Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri= In Missouri, on November 5, 2014, a state judge in St. Louis ruled Missouri's ban unconstitutional. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster announced plans to appeal the ruling to the Missouri Supreme Court, but not to seek a stay of the ruling's implementation because \\"[f]ollowing decisions in Idaho and Alaska, the United States Supreme Court has refused to grant stays on identical facts.\\" The ruling directed St. Louis to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and the city's marriage license department immediately complied. St. Louis County, where an official said \\"We believe it's a county- by-county decision\\", began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples the next day. Koster and the Recorders' Association of Missouri said the decision only applied to the city of St. Louis. On November 7, a U.S. District Court judge ruled in Lawson v. Jackson County that Missouri's ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. He stayed enforcement of his ruling pending appeal, and the Attorney General announced plans to appeal to the Eighth Circuit. In Jackson County, which includes Kansas City, officials began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples the same day. On November 25, 2014, U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker struck down Arkansas' ban on same-sex marriage in Jernigan v. Crane, and she stayed enforcement of her ruling pending appeal. On November 25, 2014, in Campaign for Southern Equality v. Bryant, U.S. District Judge Carlton W. Reeves found Mississippi's ban on same- sex marriage unconstitutional and issued a 14-day stay, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay pending appeal on December 4. 2014‚Äì2015 =Florida= U.S. District Judge Robert L. Hinkle, ruling in Brenner v. Scott, had found Florida's ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional on August 21, 2014, and stayed enforcement pending further appeals. On December 19, the U.S. Supreme Court refused the extend his stay, the first time that the Supreme Court refused to stay a marriage equality ruling by a district court in a circuit that had not yet ruled on the issue of same-sex marriage. On January 1, 2015, after he had been challenged by some court clerks who believed he could not use the case to require them to license same-sex marriages, Judge Hinkle explained the scope of his injunction in Brenner v. Scott, writing that the Constitution rather than his order authorizes all Florida clerks to issue licenses to same-sex couples and that while clerks are free to interpret his ruling differently they should anticipate lawsuits if they fail to issue such licenses. In response, the law firm advising the Florida Association of Court Clerks reversed its earlier position and recommended that all clerks issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Same- sex marriage became legal throughout Florida when Hinkle's injunction took effect on January 6. =U.S. Supreme Court accepts cases= On January 16, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear four cases on appeal from the Sixth Circuit, consolidating them as one and setting a briefing schedule to be completed April 17. The cases were: Obergefell v. Hodges (Ohio), Tanco v. Haslam (Tennessee), DeBoer v. Snyder (Michigan), and Bourke v. Beshear (Kentucky). Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Department of Justice would file an amicus brief in the case asking the court to \\"make marriage equality a reality for all Americans\\". The Court refused a request for certiorari before judgment in a Louisiana case, Robicheaux v. Caldwell, on January 12. In the weeks that followed, some federal courts suspended proceedings while awaiting a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals did so in cases from Florida case, Brenner v. Scott, Georgia, Inniss v. Aderhold, and Alabama, Searcy v. Strange. A U.S. district court did so in North Dakota, Ramsay v. Dalrymple. =Alabama= On January 23, 2015 U.S. District Judge Callie V.S. Granade ruled in Searcy v. Strange that Alabama's ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. On January 25, Judge Granade stayed her ruling for 14 days to allow the state to seek a longer stay from the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. A stay was denied by both the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court. On January 27, Judge Granade ruled in a second lawsuit, Strawser v. Strange in favor of a male couple seeking the right to marry on Alabama. She stayed her ruling to coincide with her stay in Searcy. With a conflicting order from the Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore ordering county clerks to not comply with the federal rulings, the Probate Judges Association acknowledged that the order in Searcy, if lifted, requires them to issue marriage licenses to same- sex couples and said it would encourage its members to comply. A week after the rulings went into effect, the majority of counties began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. On March 3, 2015, the Alabama Supreme Court ordered all counties in the state to stop issuing marriage licenses to same- sex couples. Granade issued an injunction on May 21, 2015, clarifying that her order for same-sex marriage applied statewide. However, she stayed the ruling pending the outcome of Obergefell v. Hodges at the U.S. Supreme Court. =Guam= The Pacific island of Guam was set to be the first U.S. territory to offer legal same-sex marriage after Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson, Guam's attorney general, directed the territorial Department of Public Health and Social Services to begin processing same-sex marriage licenses on April 15, 2015. However, the department director and Governor Eddie Calvo pushed back on Barrett-Anderson's directive, which they said was not binding. In May, the Guam District Court denied territorial officials' request to delay the case until the Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell. Obergefell v. Hodges The crowd assembled in front of the Supreme Court shortly before the Court handed down its decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. Decided on June 26, 2015 in a 5-4 decision, Obergefell requires all states to issue marriage licenses to same- sex couples and to recognize same-sex marriages validly performed in other jurisdictions. This held all state same-sex marriage bans to be unconstitutional and legalized same-sex marriage in all remaining states. The decision came on the second anniversary of the United States v. Windsor ruling that struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which denied federal recognition of same-sex marriages. It also came on the twelfth anniversary of Lawrence v. Texas which struck down sodomy laws in 13 states. Each justice's opinion on Obergefell was consistent with their opinion in Windsor. In both cases, Justice Kennedy authored the majority opinion and was considered the \\"swing vote\\". By this decision, Newsweek headlined \\"U.S. Joins Many European, Some South American Countries in Legalizing Gay Marriage.\\"https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/06/26/us-joins- many-european-some-south-american-countries-in-legalizing-gay-marriage.

He had experimented greatly with colors to delineate his figures. His works' themes are taken extensively from folk genre. He is also one of the Masters of Modernism. Antonio's more recent works see him moving toward abstraction, or a mix of the abstract and the figurative. He has been labeled both a modernist and an expressionist, successfully crafting an aesthetic that has allowed him to maintain his practice for over 50 years, exhibiting both here and abroad.

Blanco is a National Artist Nominee renowned for his exuberant paintings that captures what it is to be a Filipino. He was a leading painter in his town and the Philippines, with paintings that celebrate the culture, history and traditions of his beloved country. Father of the Family of Painters, he graced seven children who are artists in their own rights, namely: Glenn, Noel, Michael, Joy, Jan, Gay, and Peter Paul. Through the years, developed his well-defined insight into the world, the everyday routine remarkably captured in the most brilliant of colors, with clarity; authenticity on the Filipino experience that their family have lovingly depicted. Humble beginnings Born on March 19, 1932 in Angono, Rizal his father was that of a humble fisherman and mother, a friendly sari sari store owner. Jose V. Blanco nicknamed \\"Pitok Bunggan\\" from a young age showed an unusual excellence in drawing with crayons and painting with watercolor. His father, however, discouraged this, and preferred that his son to help him in his livelihood of fishing. =Childhood= Jose \\"Pitok\\" Blanco is second of seven children, six boys and one girl. Natural to the family, especially that to \\"Pitok\\" is his artistic gift and discipline, which traces back to an uncle of his mother, Pedro Pi√±on, an artist of the late 19th century. Like most artists of that period, Pi√±on produced many pieces of religious art, such as altar-pieces or commonly known as retablo, and even more so, exquisite sculptures of santo. Recurrent although from Pi√±on's time to the contemporary time of Pitok, the art scene (particularly in places familiar) was young and was not given much notice. =College of Fine Arts= Blanco, now with the support of both his parents, had his studies at the University of Santo Tomas to pursue his passion in art. Blanco's Family however, lacked the finance to support an artistic career, so Pitok frequented fishing with his father at night and depended on the generosity of the lake Laguna de Bay to suffice his bus fare and necessities for the following day. Blanco had the tutelage of various artists such as The Triumvirate of Filipino Modern art including his Ninong, (in English, 'Godfather') and National Artist Botong Francisco, Galo Ocampo, National Artist Victorio Edades, as well as Garcia Llamas, Celis, Bonifacio Cristobal among many others, and he accordingly excelled in his education, although in the latter part of his career, as all artists do, had develop his distinct, and subjectively superior approach in art. Graduated in 1955 Bachelor of Fine Arts, Major in Advertising; UST and awarded First prize Graduation Thesis, Jose V. Blanco fresh with his degree, for three years went through a struggle of uncertain employment. = Creative prerequisite= In 1969, Blanco from art director then supervisor, would be further promoted at the advertising agency J. Walter Thompson and then realized that in order to devote more time to his own art must move forward, but with a sacrifice of resigning from his advertising job. In 1971, he had his first one-man show at the Manila Hilton Art Gallery, and with the initial success of the exhibit had him brave to leave his job in the advertising agency, and venture off an uncertain future. Subsequently, in two years, he had two one-man shows in succession at the Galerie Blue. The following years then paved way for the success: various awards, notably the \\"Sanggunian Bayan\\" which gave him recognition from his whole town of upbringing, vast numbers of travel opportunities locally and abroad, and a gifted family of tour de force in art.

Constructed by the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) in 1896 as \\"Queen East Station\\", on what is now the Lakeshore East line, the station was renamed \\"Riverdale Station\\" in 1907. The Canadian National Railway (CNR) took over the station in 1923, when they absorbed the Grand Trunk Railway. CNR discontinued passenger train service at the station in 1932 and demolished the building in 1974. History The station was originally built at grade, with a level crossing at Queen Street. This level crossing was considered very dangerous and on November 17, 1904, a collision here between a Toronto Railway Company streetcar and a GTR freight train killed three people and injured seventeen. Construction began in 1925 on the Toronto Grade Separation project which was completed in 1930. The rebuilding of this eastern approach, beyond the Toronto Terminals Railway limit, eliminated the level crossing. The station had to be moved northwest to accommodate construction of the Queen Street overpass. The last site of the station building is now part of City of Toronto's Bruce Mackey Park, (formerly Wardell Parkette) which runs along the westerly side of the railway tracks, between Queen and Dundas Streets. Plans to build a GO Station at this location have been discussed as part of Metrolinx's Yonge Relief Network Study. The proposed SmartTrack plan, raised during the 2014 Toronto Mayoral Election, would also build a station here, where GO Transit's Stouffville commuter service crosses Queen Street.

Its planned route would have taken it from the northern split of I-65 and I-70 to 38th Street, entirely within Indianapolis. History I-165 was originally planned as a spur route between I-65 and 38th Street in Indianapolis. The freeway was added to the Interstate System on June 6, 1978, using mileage available from withdrawals in other states. Acting Administrator Karl S. Bowers of the Federal Highway Administration stated that I-165 could not later be withdrawn under the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 103(e)(2) or 103(e)(4); mileage could only be withdrawn once and to permit redesignated mileage to be withdrawn would incur a second entitlement for substitute funds. Sections 107(a)(1) and (b) of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1978 prohibited any future Interstate additions or redesignations under 23 U.S.C. 103(e)(2) or 103(e)(4) after November 6, 1978. On August 25, 1980, Administrator John S. Hassell wrote the Indiana State Highway Commission rescinding the condition in Mr. Bowers's 1978 letter. The withdrawal of I-165 as a proposed highway was approved on July 30, 1981, in Administrator R. A. Barnhart's letter to Indiana Governor Robert D. Orr. On April 16, 1981, Governor Robert D. Orr and Mayor William H. Hudnut III submitted a joint request by the State of Indiana and the City of Indianapolis for the withdrawal of I-165 from the Interstate System. Federal Highway Administrator R.A. Barnhart and Urban Mass Transportation Administrator Arthur E. Teele approved the withdrawal under the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 103(e)(4) on July 30, 1981.

Sechehaye (n√©e Burdet; September 27, 1887 ‚Äì June 1, 1964) was a Swiss psychotherapist. A pioneer in the psychoanalytic treatment of people with schizophrenia, she developed the symbolic realization method for treating psychotic patients. The approach was rooted in psychoanalytic and existential theory. Life Sechehaye was raised in a Protestant family and, as was common at the time, attended a single-sex school. She studied at the University of Geneva where she attended lectures by Ferdinand de Saussure on linguistics. Her notes from these lectures assisted Charles Bally and her husband, Albert Sechehaye, to develop Course in General Linguistics. After graduating Sechehaye studied at the Rousseau Institute, where she worked as the assistant of √âdouard Clapar√®de, and later went on to establish her own practice based on the encouragement of Raymond de Saussure. Sechehaye followed the work of Sigmund Freud and Jean Piaget closely, believing there was a link between psychosis and trauma experienced as a child. One of her most notable cases was undertaken with a psychotic patient referred to as \\"Ren√©e\\", a pseudonym used for Louisa D√ºss,Sometimes spelled Duess or Duss in accounts, but captured as D√ºss in Sechehaye's personal papers held at the Biblioth√®que de Gen√®ve. whom the Sechehayes eventually adopted. Over the course of their work together, Sechehaye took the unique approach of chronicling D√ºss' journal entries and personal reflections in tandem with her own clinical commentary. The approach significantly influenced mental illness research by introducing an antipsychiatry framework that positioned the patient's experiences as a valid means of establishing their case histories. As a result of this work, the book Autobiography of a Schizophrenic Girl: The True Story of \\"Renee\\" was published highlighting the most memorable aspects of the disease. Sechehaye's work was of particular interest to psychiatrist R.D. Laing who referenced three of her books in The Divided Self: An Existential Study in Sanity and Madness.

It connected the Little Calumet River to the Illinois and Michigan (I&M;) Canal, and ran from Blue Island, where the Little Calumet made a hairpin turn toward Lake Michigan, to meet the I&M; canal at Sag Bridge. The canal was completed in 1849, and covered . It was one of four feeder canals built for the I&M;, the others being the Du Page Feeder, Fox River Feeder and Kankakee Feeder. The canal was surveyed in 1845; construction began in 1848, and was completed late in the winter of 1848-1849. It began to operate in 1849. The Calumet Feeder was constructed principally to provide additional water so that the I&M; canal could maintain a navigable depth, but it also carried commercial traffic of its own. The construction of the canal brought significant economic development to Blue Island. As built, the canal was wide at the surface, wide at the base, and deep, with of freeboard. To avoid flooding from the Little Calumet, a control lock was installed on the dam at Blue Island. After the city of Chicago began to operate steam engines at the Bridgeport pumping station in 1859, the canal was no longer regularly used as a water supply for the I&M.; The canal became extremely controversial in Indiana, because of the large dam that had been constructed in order to accumulate sufficient water in the Little Calumet to supply the canal. The water from the dam backed up into Indiana and reduced the value of farmland there. In 1874, when the canal was no longer needed, Illinois breached the dam at Indiana's request. The order for the removal of the dam was issued on April 9, 1874. From that point the feeder ceased entirely to function as a water source for the I&M.; The construction of the deeper Calumet Sag Channel in the 1910s drained the remaining water out of the Calumet Feeder. Today very little remains of the canal, apart from some fragments of the original dam near Blue Island.

Their routine had a mock Egyptian style and their dance moves included tap, soft-shoe and sand-dancing. Eccentric dance is a style of dance performance in which the moves are unconventional and individualistic. It developed as a genre in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a result of the influence of African and exotic dancers on the traditional styles of clog and tap dancing. Instead of holding the body stiff and straight in the style of a jig, acrobatics such as flips and contortions were used in a more exuberant, expressive and idiosyncratic way. The style was used in stage performances such as minstrel shows, music hall or vaudeville. Dance styles which used eccentric moves and encouraged improvisation, such as the Charleston, became popular crazes in the 1920s. It was used in movies to provide comic relief. Early distinctive forms of eccentric dancing had names like rubber legs or legomania. Rubberlegging involved leg shaking or snaking which later evolved into Shag and the showcase style of Elvis Presley, while legomania added leaps and kicks in the air. An example of legomania is Ray Bolger's performance as the Scarecrow singing \\"If I Only Had a Brain\\" in The Wizard of Oz. Joel Schechter describes eccentric dance as the \\"vaudevillian impulse to dance like crazy, even if the legs do not agree with the upper torso, or the music, about which way to go.\\" Marshall Winslow Stearns defines it as follows: > The term \\"eccentric\\" is a catchall for dancers who have their own non- > standard movements and sell themselves on their individual styles. It has > been used to describe a variety of highly personal performances by dancer- > comedians on Broadway. Thus, George M. Cohan, Leon Errol, Joe Frisco, George > White, Harland Dixon, Jack Donahue, James Barton, Tom Patricola, Hal Leroy, > Buddy Ebsen, and Ray Bolger have all been labeled eccentric dancers at one > time or another, although some are much more than that, and James Barton, > for example, used eccentric movements along with a wealth of other and > perhaps finer steps.

Hero Found is a biography of Vietnam War hero Dieter Dengler, a German-born United States Navy naval aviator who endured six months of imprisonment and torture before being rescued. Dengler survived 23 days in the jungle after escaping from a Pathet Lao prison camp. Synopsis Dieter Dengler's survival skills are established at an early age growing up in the chaos of World War II Germany. After his father is killed in the war, his mother teaches Dieter and his brothers how to survive on their own in the forest. Dieter learns what foods are safe to eat and how to find shelter from the elements. His lifelong love of aviation begins as he observes an Allied fighter fly past at tree-top level with the pilot wearing goggles and a white scarf. At sixteen, Dieter decides to move to America to become a pilot. Surviving on his wits and with little money, Dieter sails to New York City aboard SS America. He joins the U.S. Navy and becomes a naval aviator. After additional flight training, Dengler is assigned to VA-145 flying the Douglas A-1 Skyraider aboard . In January 1966, Ranger reaches the coast of Vietnam to conduct combat operations. On February 1, 1966, Dieter is shot down during a mission into Laos and crash-lands in a jungle clearing. A day later, he is captured by the Pathet Lao. Dieter is beaten by his captors and forced to march through the jungle for over a week. After refusing to sign papers denouncing the United States, he is beaten into unconsciousness. As the forced march continues, Dieter escapes but is recaptured and tortured. Two weeks after his crash-landing, Dieter arrives at a Prisoner of War (POW) camp having marched 85 miles. Here he meets other prisoners including Dwayne Martin, Prasit Thanee, Phisit Intharathat, To Yick Chiu, and Eugene DeBruin, some of whom have been imprisoned for two and a half years. The group endures illness, starvation, and brutal treatment waiting for the monsoon season when there will be enough water to sustain them during an escape. The rains do not come on time and conditions deteriorate at the camp to a point where the guards plan to kill the prisoners and return home. On June 29, 1966, the prisoners decide to attempt their escape. A fight ensues leaving many of the guards dead. The group splits up with Dieter and Dwayne marching into the forest toward Thailand. The monsoon rains start, but the pair are soon lost and gradually weaken as they struggle through the jungle. They surprise a villager who decapitates Dwayne with a machete. Dieter is pursued by the villagers and Pathet Lao but manages to avoid them. He continues to weaken and begins to hallucinate. Near the end of his strength, Dieter rests on a rock and sees a United States Air Force Skyraider flying towards him. Dieter signals the aircraft and is spotted by the pilot, Eugene Deatrick, who persists in calling a rescue despite the possibility that this could be a trap. On July 20, 1966, Dieter is finally rescued from his ordeal after 23 days in the jungle and six months after he was shot down. Dieter is reunited with his comrades on Ranger and begins the long recovery to health. His story of survival and endurance is widely reported in the press and celebrated by the U.S. government. Dieter is awarded the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism. He leaves military service and enjoys the life he so nearly lost. In 2000, Dieter is diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and gradually loses his mobility and ability to speak. Dieter tells his wife that the disease is worse than the prison camp in Laos. On February 7, 2001, Dieter commits suicide to escape from a disease that would cage him in his own body. In March 2001, Dieter is buried in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. Reviews Hero Found received positive reviews. Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"a short but engaging tale of a harrowing POW experience.\\" Publishers Weekly stated \\"This often riveting account sheds new light on an oft-told true story.\\" Audiofile observed \\"Narrator Todd McLaren delivers the many scenes of aerial action and combat with enthusiasm and excitement.

Although based in Silicon Valley, The Founder Institute maintains chapters in over 180 cities and more than 65 different nations across the globe. It offers a four-month part-time program for new and early-stage entrepreneurs that helps them develop their business ideas and form a company. Among the key requirements for graduation is the creation of a fully operational company by the end of the four-month program. As of 2018, over 3,500 companies had been created from the program, which raised over $800M funding in total. History The Founder Institute was founded in 2009 by Adeo Ressi in his garage in Palo Alto, California. It was created with his friend and business partner Jonathan Greechan as a response to the 2008 market crash and the attendant failures of numerous startups. From the outset, its primary goal was to provide a safe place for companies to materialize and entrepreneurs to hone their skills. Ressi also wanted to \\"globalize Silicon Valley\\" and make entrepreneurial training available to people around the world. One of the earliest visions of The Founder Institute was to launch 1,000 companies per year. Graduates were given access to a \\"shared liquidity pool,\\" where all participants in the program share equity in the companies formed. The first class graduated in October 2009 in Silicon Valley and was composed of 66 entrepreneurs and 54 companies. By the middle of 2010, The Founder Institute had chapters in ten cities throughout the world, including New York City, San Diego, Berlin, and Singapore. In May 2010, the chapters in New York and D.C. graduated a total of 25 new startups. By the end of 2011, it had more than 20 locations worldwide and had graduated 483 entrepreneurs with 415 total companies. It also maintained around 700 mentors. In addition, The Founder Institute announced that it had become that \\"largest incubator in the world.\\" Adeo Ressi started the Female Founder Fellowship program to help address the dearth of women in the tech industry. Women founders accounted for roughly 20% of all startups and graduates at The Founder Institute in 2011. By 2012, that percentage had increased to 36%. In September 2012, The Founder Institute achieved a milestone of 650 startups graduated. It had also expanded its operations to 32 cities in 19 countries (including Vietnam, Mexico, and Israel). In 2013, it achieved another milestone with 1,000 startups created in roughly four years. Around 89% of those companies were still operational, and 74% of those were at or ahead of their prescribed growth plans. In 2014, The Founder Institute moved to a new headquarters in downtown Palo Alto. It commemorated the move with a unicorn-themed party. At the end of 2014, The Founder Institute was located in over 80 cities in 40 countries worldwide and had been responsible for the creation of over 1,300 companies. Program The program offered by The Founder Institute has been considered unique by comparison to other incubator programs. It is a four-month program that recruits and accepts new and early-stage entrepreneurs who may still be full- time employed, and who don't necessarily yet have a fully formed idea or company. One of the key requirements for graduation is the incorporation of a company. Only around 40% of enrolled students end up graduating the program. Another main feature of The Founder Institute's program is its global reach. Because of the large number of chapters throughout the world, more entrepreneurs can gain access to the training and networking. Each chapter has its own mentors, but the curriculum is similar amongst all locales. It only chooses mentors who are successful founders or CEOs in and of themselves. As of 2014, there were 3,100 CEO mentors in The Founder Institute network. Networking is another major component of the program, allowing entrepreneurs to communicate (often for the first time) with like-minded individuals in their region. The Founder has a \\"shared liquidity pool\\" that rewards graduates, mentors, and local directors for the successes of their peers. =Predictive admissions test= The Founder Institute has an application process that requires a proprietary aptitude and personality test designed to identify \\"entrepreneurial personality traits.\\" In 2010 it was reported that of those accepted after testing, 57% performed as predicted with 27% performing worse and 16% performing better than predicted. By 2013, more than 15,000 applicants had taken the test which resulted in accepted applicants who created 650 companies in 39 different cities throughout five continents. The test is reported to take approximately 1 hour, and measures aptitude, intelligence, and five psychological personality traits. All of this information is then reportedly cross-referenced with data from Institute graduates, and is used to compile a database that seeks to pinpoint the ideal score for a successful entrepreneur. The data continues being collected even after the students have graduated the program. For example, if a student's company earns a liquidity event (IPO, sale, etc.), their scores will be increased. Applicants are given a score of 0 to 5, 5 being the highest, that helps predict how well the applicant will do as an entrepreneur. The test has been the feature of discussion in publications such as CNN Money, Tech Crunch, and Forbes. Curriculum The curriculum of The Founder Institute is often taught sequentially. Throughout the four-month program, students are asked to work on their ideas, research their ideas, name their company and product, seek out co-founders, and work out a business model. The curriculum is guided by The Founder Institute, but taught by mentors with experience as startup founders and/or CEOs. The curriculum also uses a hands-on approach, often exposing students to situations that an entrepreneur would find themselves in. It creates working groups that combine 4 or 5 students together. These groups meet several times each week to discuss the formation of their business plan. The curriculum is similar throughout all of the chapters, but sessions aren't universally conducted in English. Mentors guide entrepreneurs through the program with training and feedback, and participate in the ‚Äúshared equity pool‚Äù. Mentors in The Founder Institute have include Aaron Patzer and Phil Libin, both of whom have mentored at the Silicon Valley chapter. Additional mentors have included Robin Chase, Peter Vesterbacka, and Jeffrey Paine. Locations As of 2018, The Founder Institute has chapters in over 180 cities and more than 65 nations on 6 continents. The founding chapter is located in Silicon Valley. Each chapter has its own local directors and mentors. The Silicon Valley chapter is the oldest chapter in The Founder Institute system. Eren Bali, who graduated from the initial class, is one of the co-founders of the online educational marketplace, Udemy. The Berlin chapter was one of the first chapters to come to Europe (behind the Paris and Brussels chapters). The current director is Didier Vermeiren, who is an alumnus of the Brussels chapter. The Berlin chapter has produced startups like Itembase, Kiddify, and Letsmake. The Singapore chapter was launched in 2010 and is one of the most successful chapters of The Founder Institute in Asia. Mikhail Choo graduated from the Singapore chapter in 2011 and sold his company, Gridblaze, for a 7 figure price in 2013. iCarsClub, which secured $60 million in funding in 2014, is also a product of the Singapore chapter. Notable companies  As of 2014, The Founder Institute has produced around 1,300 companies and graduates throughout its existence, including Udemy, Kindara, and Zirtual.

E-services created under this initiative include i-Voting, e-Tax Board, e-Business, e-Banking, e-Ticket, e-School, University via internet, the e-Governance Academy , as well as the release of several mobile applications.  History  In 1991, Estonia restored its independence as a sovereign nation, defeating the Soviet occupation. Prior to this, there was little in the way of technology. Under half of its population had a phone line. Following independence, the first Prime Minister Mart Laar helped push the country through a period of modernization, establishing the foundation needed to bring the country into the digital age. Digital reform followed through to the present. Early during the reform Estonia refused an offer from Finland to give it its old analogue telephone exchange for free, electing instead to build its own digital phone system. An initiative to provide schools with computers succeeded in granting every school in the country with internet access by 1998. In 2000, the government declared internet access to be a human right, causing its spread into rural areas. System architect Tarvi Martens was described in The New Yorker as the \\"putative grandfather of Estonia‚Äôs digital platform\\".  e-Residency  In late 2014 Estonia became the first country to offer electronic residency to people from outside the country, a step that the Estonian government terms as \\"moving towards the idea of a country without borders.\\" Under this program, non-residents can apply to have a smart ID card issued to them by the state, providing the same access to Estonia's various electronic services that a physical resident would be given. Use of the card for authentication with these services requires a four digit pin code. The card, in conjunction with a separate pin code, also allows e-residents to digitally sign documents over the internet, a practice that is legally binding anywhere in the EU. While e-residency provides access to these services, it does not grant physical residency, the right to enter the country, or the ability to use the smart ID card as physical identification or as a travel document. Technology The data for e-Estonia is not stored centrally, but instead uses a data platform run by the government called X-Road to link information from local hosts. The system is backed up on servers in Luxembourg, which is governed with the same protections afforded for a diplomatic mission. The system is designed to allow the government of Estonia to function even in the event of an invasion by Russia. Individuals are able to access all e-Estonia data about themselves, and all queries to the system are logged. In 2017, a Czech research team found a vulnerability in the physical chips used in many of the e-Estonia cards to establish identity, leading to the cards being temporarily locked. Functions Estonian paramedics have access to an e-ambulance app, which - via X-Road - allows medical personnel immediate access to patient medical records. The system is also used for telemedicine. e-Estonia enabled electronic voting via the i-voting app, which used an I.D.-card-based system to cast ballots remotely. In 2014, approximately one-third of all votes were cast using the app. See also *Digital 5 *Digital Single Market *Digital signature in Estonia *E-democracy *E-governance *E-residency of Estonia Further reading   * References Category:E-commerce in Estonia Category:E-government Category:E-democracy Category:Government agencies of Estonia Category:Internet in Estonia ","title":"E-Estonia"},{"id":"45289097","title":"2014 Men's European Volleyball League squads"},{"id":"45289107","title":"1974 Orange Bowl"},{"id":"45289128","text":"TheFunded is a review website that allows users to post anonymous ratings and reviews of venture capital investment firms. It was founded in 2007 by entrepreneur, Adeo Ressi. In addition to providing ratings and reviews, users can communicate with one another to garner entrepreneurial insight and advice. In 2011, the site had over 16,000 users, more than 25,000 reviews, and over 24,000 user comments. History Adeo Ressi began working on TheFunded in December 2006 and unveiled an early version of the site on New Year's Eve. The site was initially intended for Ressi's personal use. Due to negative experiences with venture capital firms in the previous year, he wanted to keep closer tabs on his investors. He was also going to allow his close CEO friends to provide their own feedback. In total, the site had about a dozen users for the first three months. In March 2007, however, information about the site had leaked to TechCrunch, and TheFunded received numerous applications to join. Ressi allowed about 100 new users to sign up, but the user base grew to 1,000 by May. In January 2008, the site had 4,600 users. The goal of TheFunded was always to provide more transparency in how venture capitalists dealt with clients. The nature of the site's ratings and reviews, however, has been described as candid, scathing, and even nasty. In the early days of TheFunded, Ressi adopted the pseudonym \\"Ted\\" to avoid the ire of venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. The identity of \\"Ted\\" was a frequent source of speculation among venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. Because Ressi had heard rumors about his identity being revealed, he decided to reveal his identity on his own terms in a piece in Wired on November 15, 2007. TheFunded was the subject of numerous defamation lawsuits from venture capital firms in 2008 and beyond. Some estimates suggest that TheFunded received angry letters from lawyers at least twice per week. The lawsuits were almost universally dismissed because the Communications Decency Act stipulated that TheFunded could not be held liable for third-party comments on their website. Additionally, the users leaving the comments remained completely anonymous. In 2009, TheFunded unveiled a list of \\"blacklisted\\" venture capital firms. Inclusion on the list meant that these firms were suspected of pressuring clients to give positive reviews, threatening legal action against TheFunded or its members, or failing to make new investments. Users were urged to avoid doing business with these firms. By 2011, the site had over 16,000 users, more than 25,000 reviews, and over 24,000 user comments. This was despite the fact that the site had seen a marked downturn in user traffic. Features TheFunded allows users (typically entrepreneurs and CEOs) to rate and review venture capitalists and engage in community activities and discussions. All actions on the website are carried out anonymously. The site maintains an \\"Advice\\" section where entrepreneurs can formulate and discuss plans for business growth. The rating system is based on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being the best. Users can then leave comments to explain their rating. The \\"Banned VCs\\" feature on TheFunded prohibits venture capital firms from appearing on the site's \\"Leaderboard,\\" which identifies the most highly-rated firms and investors. Gaining membership to the site was initially an \\"invite-only\\" proposition. Now, users can \\"apply\\" for membership. TheFunded only permits certain qualified individuals to join in order to reduce vandalism. The site earns money from both advertising and subscriptions. Subscriptions to the site provide full access to special features and cost around $400 per year.

History The group were formed in 1989 by Robert 'Wobbly Bob' Chambers (guitar, bass, vocals), Ivor Vasquez (drums) and Ben 'The Bass' Jackson (bass, vocals), with Caroline Davey (vocals, keyboards, harmonica) joining in 1991. They recorded and produced a series of home-made cassette albums which they sold locally, and made their first vinyl appearance when they contributed the professionally recorded song \\"Thoughts of the Sky\\" to the 1992 Delerium Records compilation \\"Fun With Mushrooms\\". Jackson then left, from which point Chambers played bass in their recordings while other bassists played live with the band, including Niall Hone (from Mandragora, 1993) and Dan Chapman (1994-95). Their third cassette, \\"Overflowing Bowl Of Green Jelly\\", received a limited vinyl reissue on the Magic Gnome label in 1994, and the 1999 September Gurls label LP/CD \\"It Came From Nowhere\\" brought together archive tracks from a number of different line-ups. Vasquez left the band in 1996, replaced by 'Trippy Fish', and Davey left in 1997 before Chambers ended the group around 2000. The style and image of Wobble Jaggle Jiggle was based heavily on 1960s psychedelia and heavy drug references. The band's name was taken from Chambers' description of a drug experience, and many of his lyrics alluded to counter-culture lifestyle of \\"getting stoned and wearing groovy clothes\\". Chambers was also a prolific artist and created all of the band's album artwork and additional comic strip bonus material. Caroline Davey's vocals were frequently compared to Grace Slick. Chambers' guitar playing was influenced by the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Syd Barrett, and the band were part of the late-1980s/early 1990s British acid rock revival alongside bands like Spacemen 3, Sun Dial and The Bevis Frond. The rarity of their deliberately lo-fi cassette tape releases meant that it was only with the advent of the internet that their albums reached a wider audience and developed a cult following after the group had already split. Caroline Davey also sang with the bands Cherokee Mist and Mandragora and continues to perform as a solo artist. In September 2003 Wobbly Bob (guitar, vocals) formed the group 'Daddy Fantastic', named after a Wobble Jaggle Jiggle song which was in turn named after one of his cartoon character creations. He was joined by 'The Baron' (bass, vocals) and 'Nimbus' (drums, also of Crawlspace). In August 2004 they added Pete 'The Daddy' Bennett (vocals) and developed a live show involving performance artists. In 2006 Bennett entered and won the 'Big Brother' reality TV show, and left the band to launch a solo career. The original members continued to perform until Rob Chambers died in December 2008, aged 41.

A daughter of Simon and Ann (Murray) MacKenzie, she was born August 18, 1872 in Waterside, Pictou County, Nova Scotia, Canada. MacKenzie led her class in surgery and graduated from Dalhousie University in 1904 as one of the university's earliest female doctors. After working in Boston to raise tuition money to enable her sister Molly to also complete a medical degree from Dalhousie, MacKenzie left America in September 1904 and traveled to India to work as a medical missionary. In 1909, MacKenzie established the Broadwell Christian Hospital in Fatehpur, where MacKenzie and her sister Mary worked for many years. MacKenzie's tireless efforts helped control the cholera epidemic during the 1917 Kumbh Mela pilgrimage. MacKenzie dedicated over three decades to provide medical services to the poor and sick in India. In 1919, MacKenzie was awarded the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal for Public Service in India and in 1940, Dalhousie University awarded her an honorary LLD degree.  Career  = 1904 ‚Äì Allahabad = In September 1904, after being commissioned by The Women's Missionary Society of America, MacKenzie departed Boston. Her appointment was to the very primitive, crowded town of Allahabad, in Northeast India on the Ganges River. Missionary work, though begun in the mid-1800s with much success, had not reached Allahabad or the surrounding areas, Cawnporeor Fatehpur. As the only doctor, MacKenzie was alone in the medical work. The climate was hot and uncomfortable. There was tremendous need for medical services, but no hospital. She rented a small mud shanty with a tiled verandah and crowds came to her for treatment. She had two Indian servants who helped her and they soon became very efficient and were able to provide care for many more suffering people. In less than a month, MacKenzie leased and occupied a roomy house on the outskirts of the town. She gathered more staff to cope with the ever increasing daily crowds. Although she hadn't yet learned the local language, her compassion and gentle touch drew all to her. Her medical work seemed endless, yet she also found time to look to other important things. She started a school in an antiquated and dilapidated out-building and it was soon overcrowded with children. MacKenzie and her helpers repaired and white-washed the buildings inside and out and planted a garden with shrubs and flowers. It was a great uplift to brighten the mood of the people in those surroundings and many of the surrounding huts and homes did the same to their dwellings. MacKenzie performed her first operation on a dressing table. There was no one to give the chloroform, no one to hand her instruments and the helper kept fainting. Yet, she was able to cope, with success. = 1905 ‚Äì Cawnpore = MacKenzie was moved to Cawnpore (Kanpur), where she did her work in the schools and in the hot sun. The way of travel was often by elephant or camel. Families often preferred male babies, because they could carry on the family farm, and did not require the dowry or the costly supplies and preparation for the bride to be ready for her wedding day. In desperate cases, some women would put the new born girl out on the bank of the Ganges, the sacred river, hoping that the gods of the sacred river would take care of the child. MacKenzie was not able to save the lives of all the baby girls, but ensured she baptized the infant orphans who didn't survive with her own name and provided them a Christian burial. The ones who survived were cared for in her own home. MacKenzie felt the need to take strong action to counter local customs, rather than leaving these babies to the fate of the wild animals, crocodiles, and reptiles. MacKenzie, along with other Christians, finally persuaded the Government to pass laws forbidding the disposal of living children on the banks of the Ganges or in the river. MacKenzie set up several outpost spots in the rural areas where she would go to administer medicines and treat the crowds who were always waiting. She also bought simple mud hut houses for the sick to live in near her, where she could give daily care more easily. MacKenzie's other sister Mollie, also a doctor, joined her in Cawnpore in 1905 and they laboured together to supervise activities there as well as in Allahabad. In addition to medical work, no one in the town or villages could teach Hindi, so MacKenzie along with her helpers, taught the courses. It was time for furlough for MacKenzie. Although she didn't wish to leave her sister Mollie alone, MacKenzie was asked to be a companion and helper for a sick missionary to Philadelphia. It was a successful journey. MacKenzie described the many successes and also presented the mountainous needs to the Board in New York and also in Philadelphia. She was promised help in building a $10,000 Hospital. The Mission sent $8,000 and MacKenzie was able to spend the remainder of her furlough in Nova Scotia and raised or gathered the remainder. = 1907 ‚Äì Fatehpur = Upon her return to India in 1907, MacKenzie was transferred to Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh, a new station where there were over one thousand villages. Fatehpur itself had over 19,000 inhabitants and the great many surrounding villages also needed to be served. In addition, MacKenzie and her sister Mollie would need to help the previous Mission Compounds. MacKenzie had been appointed Head Surgeon. She, with Mollie, had to conduct all the medical work, the preaching, the planning of the new buildings, the gardening, mechanical repairs, and the teaching and the training of all help. MacKenzie received a generous donation from Mr. Broadwell of Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.A. in memory of his wife, who was the founder of the Cincinnati Missionary Branch and was Vice-President of the Women's Union Missionary Society of America.. Ten acres of beautiful land with Mango groves was secured and on November 25, 1909, the cornerstone of the \\"Lily Lythe Broadwell Hospital\\" at Fatehpur was laid. In 1910, MacKenzie became Head Surgeon of the Broadwell Memorial Hospital and though not completely finished, the Hospital doors were opened to the public for use. The staff was increased, patients came hundreds of miles for relief from their sufferings and operations were performed with dignity, for the first time, in an operating room and closed doors. To raise operating funds for the hospital, in 1910 MacKenzie wrote: \\"Many beds are already furnished for occupation and endowments of $600.00 each have been given. Would you not feel it a priceless privilege to perpetuate in that far-off land where women have been doomed to privation and suffering for countless ages? The memory of some loved one can live on by helping the cause in India. If this is not possible, perhaps you could send twenty-five dollars which will support a bed for a year. Smaller sums would provide medicines or other necessities in the Hospital. The support of a native nurse is fifty dollars annually and in assuming this, a double benefit is secured to a patient and to the young native girl who is training for a life of usefulness. How many who have known the untold value of trained nurses in case of serious illness would be willing to pass on this benefit to suffering women in India? We need the help of every friend.\\" This message went back to New York to the \\"Women's Missionary Society ‚Äì Organization of the Head Office of America.\\" It was published in the \\"Missionary Link,\\" the monthly Missionary booklet. The response was great and the Broadwell Hospital became fully equipped for all services. MacKenzie helped set up many dispensaries in the rural parts of Allahabad, Fatehpur, Cawnpore (Kanpur) and Jhansi . In the outpost area one Dispensary was built with personal monies of the two sister doctors and other relatives and friends from home. It was named, \\"The Ann Murray Dispensary\\" in memory of their beloved mother and served many, many thousands of persons. Trained Nursing Helpers administered medicines and gave nursing care to those who came. The very sick had the care of either doctor, or perhaps both doctors. Operations were performed more skilfully in the new equipped operating area of the hospital. In around 1911, Mollie completed her Medical and Bible work in Allahabad, Cawnpore and Fatehpur and later that year married Rev. Alexander Alonzo Smith in Pictou, Nova Scotia. MacKenzie worked on at Fatehpur as Head Surgeon, with the help of Miss Todd and Miss Campbell. She needed an ambulance and not having any way to get one, she built one with the help of the male workers. MacKenzie was injured while waiting at a station for some sick persons to get off the train. An iron was dropped on her arm, breaking it. She set the arm at the station herself and proceeded to attend to the patients. She always travelled third class by train. She spent the time teaching and preaching to the passengers. They all crowded eagerly to her to hear her message. Her love and kindness was uppermost in all her work. Compassion for the sick and suffering bound her to help at any time, day or night. A young wife waved at a childhood boyfriend in the presence of her husband. The husband grabbed her and was determined to kill her. She fled to MacKenzie in the middle of the night for help. She did not return to the husband. MacKenzie helped her to escape, sent her to school and then to nursing school. She became Superintendent of Nurses in a very large hospital. On one of MacKenzie's trips to the slums, she found a tiny child with syphilis sores all over her body. The child was homeless and no one wanted her, so MacKenzie took the child home, adopted her and brought her up. MacKenzie called her \\"My little fairy sparrow\\" and she became a nurse. = 1917 Kumbh Mela Cholera Epidemic = Cholera had broken out in the city, and brought with it the imminent terror of death. The disease spread so quickly, it was given the name \\"The Pestilence that walks in darkness.\\" In preparation to ward off an epidemic, disinfectants were poured into wells. Meat, milk and all food found uncovered was destroyed. Places were sprayed or burned. Yet in the late time of day, bodies were being buried in the prepared burying ground or carried to the Ganges River. MacKenzie worked twenty-four hours a day for four days with little or no sleep and practically nothing to eat. It was hard, she wrote, to compete with an enemy that wins the race of death in a few short hours. Working against time, she, herself, gave the early injections and left her assistants to carry out her orders. Clad in white, her arms bared to the elbows, no time for conversation, she bent over the prostrate figures. No thought of self, she continued to relieve the agony of pain. As for food, she dared only to eat what she, herself, had carefully prepared at home. The subsiding of cholera was followed by a determined clean-up. The refugees were evacuated to a safe distance from their huts or hovels. The whole district was razed to ashes with the owner's consent. The rains came, the temperature fell and the cholera season was over. After a safe period of time, new huts began to take their place on the clean grounds. Dr. Mina did not relax her care until the infected were cured or buried. = 1920 ‚Äì Furlough in Waterside, NS = MacKenzie had set all affairs in order and the day set for farewells and leaving Fatehpur arrived. Her work was left in good hands. The station platform was crowded. Hundreds and hundreds of women who had not ever been seen in public, came to bid good-bye and to get a last glimpse of her. Some who came in horse-drawn vehicles pulled back the curtain to get a peek. Those who wore the purdah even lifted it to get a last look of their beloved doctor. It was the last time they would see her. She was to take a furlough of undetermined time. Her aged father, 94 years old, had begged her to come to him. She arrived in Waterside in late 1920 to be with her father, as he said, \\"for the rest of my days.\\" MacKenzie rented the unoccupied house of the Nichol brothers at the corner of Waterside and Three Brooks roads. In the early summer of 1921, MacKenzie prepared part of her house to be used as a private Hospital, where she along with an anesthetist from Pictou performed operations. The summer was very busy, yet successful for the patients and for MacKenzie. Through 1922, MacKenzie served a wide area of families. Some mothers came to her hospital for maternity care and for others, she went to the home. On October 31, 1922, MacKenzie's father died and was buried at Seaboard Cemetery, Carribou River, beside his wife Ann. He was blessed in that his wish was granted. MacKenzie now was free to return to India and she sailed from Quebec on May 12, 1923 for the plains of Central India. MacKenzie travelled on the Regina Steamship across the Atlantic Ocean to Liverpool, England and arrived on May 22. There, baggage was transferred to the Circassia, Anchor Line. The Circassia had only sixteen passengers aboard and few of these were going to India because of the hot season. The Circassia stopped at the Strait of Gibraltar, Port Said and Suez Canal, and continued through the Gulf of Suez to the Red Sea before heading south to the Gulf of Aden and across the Indian Ocean to Bombay. On June 18, three weeks after they had left Liverpool, the Circassia arrived in Bombay Harbour. = 1923‚Äì1929 ‚Äì Hatpipalya = In the summer of 1923, it was in Hat Piplia, thirty-five miles distant from Indore, that MacKenzie began her work under the Presbyterian Foreign Mission Board of Canada. In 1925 when the United Church of Canada came into being she, with the Mission Compound at Hat Paplia and others, came under the United Church of Canada Board. MacKenzie's personal comforts never came first. Any money given for herself went to the mission where she felt the need was more important. The Hospital was a two-storey brick building. The upper storey consisting of five rooms, accommodated Miss Coltart, Miss Glendenning (who was on furlough) and Dr. Mina MacKenzie. The lower part with an L-attached, contained a waiting room, a Dispensary, an operating room and wards, each to accommodate twenty patients. The nurses' quarters consisted of six small rooms, separated from the Hospital by a narrow courtyard. The staff consisted of two Indian women who were nurses, an Indian Bible woman, a Sub- Assistant Surgeon, Miss Coltart, R.N., and MacKenzie, Head Surgeon. In 1925, back in Canada, church Union came into being. MacKenzie, with the Mission Hospital at Hat Piplia and others came under the Mission Board of the United Church of Canada. She now would serve under \\"The United Church Foreign Mission Board of Canada.\\" She was very satisfied to be part of this new development among the Canadian Protestant Churches. India loved the word \\"United.\\" She felt more money would be sent to the \\"Overseas work\\" because the overhead expenses of the Churches in Canada would be combined. This would leave some money free to be used for the crying need of the destitute for clothing, food and decent houses in the Eastern Countries. There was an ever increasing long and longer line of waiting persons at the Dispensary each time MacKenzie came. While in M.P., MacKenzie worked in Hat Piplia, Indore, Ratlam and Dhar. They were not too far away by car and she was called many times to medical and surgical duties. = 1929‚Äì1939 Neemuch = MacKenzie gathered her family together in the large cottage at Neemuch. She also adopted several more children during those last years before her retirement. Neemuch was a well planned Mission Compound. Dr. Margaret MacKellar had guided the building of the Hospital and all the necessary rooms were arranged conveniently for working. The equipment and lamp and candle lighting in the O.R. was primitive. Operations needed to be performed with so little light, yet MacKenzie successfully performed many serious and difficult surgeries. After MacKenzie's death, her instruments and anything of use was sent to Neemuch.  Personal life  MacKenzie rescued multiple tiny infants from the banks of the Ganges River, but most were unable to survive. When MacKenzie bought the houses at Cawnpore (Kanpur), she rented one for herself and opened her first orphanage and trained an Indian woman to look after the children. The Hindu-Muslim agitation made the work of the missionary more difficult, yet MacKenzie was able to preach and treat the many crowds. She had eight children when she left the compounds of Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh. They were Phillip, Kim, Kindar, Jim, Hari, David, Frank and Umedi (who became a doctor). In Kanpur, she adopted Lily, Lucy, Cherry and the three orphaned daughters of Kim (Mina, Mary and Vina who were named after MacKenzie and her two sisters). Kim had died of tuberculosis and his wife had predeceased him with the same disease. When MacKenzie was transferred from Uttar Pradesh to Madhya Pradesh, she brought the six Kanpur children with her and they later studied in Indore Mission School. In M.P. MacKenzie worked in Hat Piplia (Hatpipalya), Indore, Ratlam, Dhar and Neemuch. During her time in Dhar, she adopted Tara, Sushila, Mona, Indira, Amina, Adina. These children studied in the Ratlam Mission School. Her last mission post was in Neemuch, where she worked for 10 years between 1929‚Äì1939, before retiring and returning to Canada. While in Neemuch, MacKenzie adopted Mariam, Sarina, Rosie, Eric and Frederick Philip. Of the forty-four children MacKenzie adopted in total, twenty-one grew to adulthood. Today, MacKenzie's legacy of love and compassion is being continued through the work of the Dr. Mina MacKenzie Memorial Trust Fund, a registered Canadian charity.

Discovered in 1969 near the city of Wuwei, in the province of Gansu, it is now in the Gansu Provincial Museum. \\"Perfectly balanced,\\" says one authority, \\"on the one hoof which rests without pressure on a flying swallow, it is a remarkable example of three-dimensional form and of animal portraiture with the head vividly expressing mettlesome vigor.\\" Description The statue is made from bronze. It is 34.5 cm in height, 45 cm in length, and 13.1 cm in width. Discovery and world fame Detail of the foot and swallow (replica) A copy of the sculpture is located on the front square of Lanzhou railway station. The Flying Horse of Gansu was discovered in 1969. It was unearthed from a Han tomb at Leitai in Wuwei. The tomb belonged to General Zhang of Zhangye. The discovery was made by a team of locals who had been told to dig air-raid shelters in the case of an imminent war with the Soviet Union. During the excavations, they found a chamber under a monastery which held a group of over 200 bronze figurines of men, horses, and chariots, which they put in plastic bags and took home. They later realized the importance of their find and reported it to provincial authorities. Professional archaeologists then took up the excavations. They discovered a three-chambered tomb which had apparently been entered by looters soon after the original burial some 2,000 years earlier. The looters had not, however, entered the chamber in which the bronzes were found. The archaeologists determined that the opulent tomb was that of a Han dynasty army general who had been given the important task of maintaining imperial frontier defenses. They took the bronzes to the museum in Lanzhou. In Lanzhou, the group of bronzes was observed by Guo Moruo, China's elder statesman of archaeology and history, who was conducting Cambodian Prince Sihanouk on a tour of China. Guo was struck by the beauty of the horse and selected it for national and international exhibition. The horse in the bronze is a breed brought back from Fergana by a punitive expedition sent by Emperor Han Wudi in 104 BCE. These \\"celestial horses\\" were highly prized as marks of status.Silk Road Foundation Although scholars pointed out that the bird was not in fact a swallow, the piece was exhibited in many countries in the 1970s as \\"Galloping Horse Treading on a Flying Swallow.\\" In 2002, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage of China included the Gansu Flying Horse in the inaugural list of 64 grade-one cultural relics that are forbidden to be taken out of mainland China for exhibition. Flying Horse of Gansu replica in Lexington Kentucky USA A copy of the sculpture was donated to the city of Lexington, Kentucky, USA on June 15th, 2000 by the City of Xi'an, China and Hao Bao Zhu, President, Five Rings International.

It has about 307 graves of the European officers killed in the final assault on Tippu Sultan in 1799, and their family members. Among the graves, there are 80 graves of the officers of the Swiss ‚Äòde Meuron Regiment‚Äô, and the rest of the graves are their family members. The cemetery entrance gate has a marble stone, reads, \\"Garrison Cemetery AD 1800. Latest burial 1860.\\" A few tombs are imposing, while others are small, some shaped like of a coffin and said to be the remains of infants who died of the plague. Many officers of the Swiss mercenary de Meuron Regiment are buried here. Regiment de Meuron The Regiment de Meuron, was a Swiss mercenary unit, in the services of the Dutch East India Company, and even fought against the British East India Company in Ceylon. Following the abeyance of wage payments by the Dutch East India Company in Ceylon in 1795, the regiment held negotiations with the British East India Company and joined their services with 800 men. The Regiment de Meuron took part in the Siege of Seringapatam (1799) against Tippu Sultan. History The Swiss officers of the Regiment de Meuron, who fell in the Siege of Seringapatam (1799) were buried at the Garrison Cemetery, Seringapatam. The first burial took place in 1800, and the cemetery was in use till 1860. The British East India Company turned Seringapatam into a garrison town, and the cemetery came to be known as the Garrison Cemetery. The Garrison Cemetery, Seringapatam, is now under the management of the CSI St. Bartholomew's Church, Mysore. Record of Constance Parsons In 1931, Parsons describes the cemetery having graves of many brave fallen soldiers. Among them, Lt. Col. Peter Dallas, who tried to save the life of Seyyid Saheb, J A Cassamaijor of the De Meuron Regiment, many young wives aged 20‚Äì24 years. One gravestone laments the loss of a young wife using Ben Jonson's epitaph for Elizabeth as Grave of Caroline Isabella Scott Constance Parsons records seeing the grave of Scott's wife at the Garrison Cemetery, with the inscription that reads \\"Caroline Isabella Scott (and infant child), wife of Colonel I C Scott, Commandant of Seringapatam; who died in child-bed, 19th April 1817.\\" The names are associated with the tragedy of the Scott's Bungalow, Seringapatam, which is located on the banks of the river Cauvery. Years of neglect Years of neglect, resulted in the magnificent memorial stones going to the brink of imminent collapse. The whole place was overrun with weeds and thick bushes. Restoration In 2007, Louis Dominique de Meuron, a descendant of the Regiment de Meuron, visited the Garrison Cemetery, along with his wife Monique. Saddened by the state of neglect of the cemetery, the couple engaged an agency in Mysore (Ravi Gundu Rao & Associates (RGRA)) to restore the graves. After their demise in 2012, restoration was continuously supported by their children Jean de Meuron and Dr. Sophie. The graves were restored to their original state in consultation with the Karnataka State Archaeology Department, and formally handed over to the de Meuron family in November 2008. The cost of restoration was around INR 3 million Lime and bricks were mainly used in the restoration, with the lime coming from a local quarry. Nearly 12-18 masons, craftsmen, and workers were involved in the restoration works. Following the restoration, the Garrison Cemetery, Seringapatam is now included in the tourist itinerary of Mysore/Srirangapatna. Descendants of the soldiers often visit the cemetery and offer homage. The caretaker of the cemetery is Ms. Vidyalakshmi, a local history enthusiast. His Majesty's Cemetery, Ganjam According to Rev. E W Thompson and other accounts, there used to exist a Madras Army cemetery called \\"His Majesty's Cemetery\\" at Ganjam, near the Gumbaz (a short distance in the North-West direction), much before the Garrison Cemetery. The cemetery was enclosed by a wall, with an inscription on the gate-post, \\"His Majesty's Cemetery, Ganjam, a.d. 1799-1808\\". It contains burials between 1799 and 1808, mainly from the 33rd Regiment. Daniel Pritchard, the music master of this regiment was buried at this cemetery in July 1799. Elinda Harmonci, a child aged 4 years was also buried here in November 1799. Col. Edward Montague of the Bengal Artillery, died 8 May 1799, 4 days after the final assault is buried near the Sangam, on the extreme east end of the island. Lord Harris's House Inscription at the Lord Harris Residence, Seringapatam Lord Harris Residence, Seringapatam Between the Garrison Cemetery and Scott's Bungalow a path leads to the house on the river banks. This house is known as \\"Lord Harris's House\\" or \\"The Doctor's Bungalow\\" or \\"Puraniah's Bungalow\\". This house was the residence of General Harris, for a short time after the Siege of Seringapatam in 1799, and went on to become headquarters of the commanding officer of Seringapatam. In 1809, this house was the scene of a mutiny by officers of the Madras Army, led by Col. Bell, against Sir. George Barlow, the Governor of Madras. Purnaiah lived in the house after his retirement from service in 1811, and died there on 28 March 1812. Days before his death, he wrote a letter to his friend Col. Hill, Commandant of Seringapatam, \\"Old and infirm, after a life of unusual activity and care, I am going to the land of my fathers\\", for which Col. Hill replied \\"Say I am travelling the same road\\", and died a short time after Purnaiah. A tablet on the wall of this house records the connection of Lord Harris and Puraniah to this house.

This article describes the relations between these various generalizations. The symbols below are arranged roughly in order of the date they were introduced, which is usually (but not always) in order of increasing generality. * Legendre symbol \\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{p}\\\\right) defined for p a prime, a an integer, and takes values 0, 1, or ‚àí1. * Jacobi symbol \\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{b}\\\\right) defined for b a positive odd integer, a an integer, and takes values 0, 1, or ‚àí1. An extension of the Legendre symbol to more general values of b. * Kronecker symbol \\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{b}\\\\right) defined for b any integer, a an integer, and takes values 0, 1, or ‚àí1. An extension of the Jacobi and Legendre symbols to more general values of b. * Power residue symbol \\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{b}\\\\right)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{b}\\\\right)_m is defined for a in some global field containing the mth roots of 1 ( for some m), b a fractional ideal of K built from prime ideals coprime to m. The symbol takes values in the m roots of 1. When m = 2 and the global field is the rationals this is more or less the same as the Jacobi symbol. * Hilbert symbol The local Hilbert symbol (a,b) = is defined for a and b in some local field containing the m roots of 1 (for some m) and takes values in the m roots of 1. The power residue symbol can be written in terms of the Hilbert symbol. The global Hilbert symbol (a,b)_p=\\\\left(\\\\frac{a,b}{p}\\\\right)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{a,b}{p}\\\\right)_m is defined for a and b in some global field K, for p a finite or infinite place of K, and is equal to the local Hilbert symbol in the completion of K at the place p. * Artin symbol The local Artin symbol or norm residue symbol \\\\theta_{L/K}(\\\\alpha) = (\\\\alpha,L/K) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{L/K}{\\\\alpha}\\\\right) is defined for L a finite extension of the local field K, Œ± an element of K, and takes values in the abelianization of the Galois group Gal(L/K). The global Artin symbol \\\\psi_{L/K}(\\\\alpha) = (\\\\alpha,L/K) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{L/K}{\\\\alpha}\\\\right)=((L/K)/\\\\alpha) is defined for Œ± in a ray class group or idele (class) group of a global field K, and takes values in the abelianization of Gal(L/K) for L an abelian extension of K. When Œ± is in the idele group the symbol is sometimes called a Chevalley symbol or Artin‚ÄìChevalley symbol. The local Hilbert symbol of K can be written in terms of the Artin symbol for Kummer extensions L/K, where the roots of unity can be identified with elements of the Galois group. *The Frobenius symbol [(L/K)/P]=\\\\left[\\\\frac{L/K}{P}\\\\right] is the same as the Frobenius element of the prime P of the Galois extension L of K. * \\"Chevalley symbol\\" has several slightly different meanings. It is sometimes used for the Artin symbol for ideles. A variation of this is the Chevalley symbol \\\\left(\\\\frac{a,\\\\chi}{p}\\\\right) for p a prime ideal of K, a an element of K, and œá a homomorphism of the Galois group of K to R/Z. The value of the symbol is then the value of the character œá on the usual Artin symbol. * Norm residue symbol This name is for several different closely related symbols, such as the Artin symbol or the Hilbert symbol or Hasse's norm residue symbol. The Hasse norm residue symbol ((\\\\alpha,L/K)/p)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha,L/K}{p}\\\\right) is defined if p is a place of K and Œ± an element of K. It is essentially the same as the local Artin symbol for the localization of K at p. The Hilbert symbol is a special case of it in the case of Kummer extensions. * Steinberg symbol (a,b). This is a generalization of the local Hilbert symbol to arbitrary fields F. The numbers a and b are elements of F, and the symbol (a,b) takes values in the second K-group of F. * Galois symbol A sort of generalization of the Steinberg symbol to higher algebraic K-theory. It takes a Milnor K-group to an √©tale cohomology group.

She succeeded Siria Bojorquez of Texas as Miss Earth United States. According to her LinkedIn profile, she has volunteered in some events such as Autism Speaks and Avon Walk for Breast Cancer. Nicolle also supports Lupus Foundation of America, American Heart Association, American Stroke Association, National Ovarian Cancer Coalition and American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Biography =Early life and career beginnings= As published in the Miss Earth' official website, Nicolle describes her childhood years as, \\"In all certainty, my childhood years were one of the best moments of my life. I recall fondly how much I enjoyed attending school, a place where I was surrounded by friends, positive energy, enthusiasm, and fantastic teachers. I had so much encouragement from my parents, letting me know I could accomplish my dreams and push for higher than what I could imagine. My home was very emphatic about education and I was quite studious as well, and while most of my memories during that time have me dressed in my uniform, I remember every night having dinner with my parents and having my father go over my homework. I was also my most active then, discovering my sports and my passions that I continue to follow even now.\\" She learned from her childhood as she says it, \\"My growing years were a time of discovery that had an impact on how I viewed happiness. I learned that discipline and hard work are the backbones to any accomplishment. If it is easy, it has already been done. I learned from my father‚Äôs many proverbs that time gives you time, but that same time can forsake you and that is why no day should ever be wasted. Most of all, I learned that in coming from a happy home, I was strong and supported. I was confident because I knew that my troubles might be another‚Äôs wish of tranquility.\\" She has graced several fashion shows and TV appearances before joining the pageantry world. Nicolle is a Colombian American. =Education= She received Bachelor of Science in Accounting from St. Joseph's College. She received a full scholarship for academic achievement. As a student, she participated in various clubs and organizations such as the Bears Varsity Swim team and the Beta Upsilon Delta sorority.

She finished as second runner up to Andrea Neu of Colorado who subsequently became Nicolle's successor as Miss Earth United States when Andrea joined in 2014.Andrea Neu crowned Miss U.S. International 2013 =Miss Earth United States 2013= Nicolle eventually joined Miss Earth United States 2013. The pageant was held in Honolulu, Hawaii. She represented the Empire State. She eventually won the title and became United States's representative to the Miss Earth pageant later that year. =Miss Earth 2013= As part of her responsibilities as a Miss Earth United States winner, she flew to the Philippines to join the Miss Earth 2013. During the entire run of the preliminary activities, Nicolle was able to get a gold medal for \\"I Love My Planet Schools Campaign\\" event and a silver medal for \\"Miss Friendship\\" category. As a Miss Earth delegate, an environmental advocacy is a must. When the organization asked what her advocacy is, she answered Biodiversity. For Nicolle, \\"Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth and the many ecosystems that harbor those organisms.\\" She then added that, \\"In a rich diverse ecosystem, there is a habitat that creates natural sustainability for all life making it stronger and more able to recover from any disasters. As the dominant species, we have the responsibility to ensure suitable environments for all organisms by consciously measuring our activities and the effects they cause. Deforestation for food crops is one of the leading causes of habitat destruction and animal endangerment. The cultivation of crops such as Palm Oil has consumed Indonesia and Malaysia‚Äôs rain forests, significantly shrinking the homes of the now endangered species of the orangutan and the Asian rhinoceros, as well as impacting many plants, herbs and flowers. It has also increased the amount of greenhouse gases and has commenced a cycle of soil depletion in that territory. Deforestation specifically as it relates to biodiversity encompasses a multitude of environmental problems and raises the need for food sustainability movements and the development of the ‚ÄòNew Economy‚Äô that will reduce the need for so many clearings. Ultimately, the importance of biodiversity as a global issue is as much an environmental piece as it is a social justice problem that I feel must be strongly pursued.\\" When asked about what she could promote about her United States, Nicolle replied, \\"The United States is a country full of culture and diversity. From coast to coast and the borders, one can find varying weather, unique accents, and local traditions limited to one area or even from another part of the world. There is also diversity of thought; with the openness to express ones opinion and boldly oppose the majority thought, there is always a like-minded individual and an initiative to be heard. The evolving nature of the United States is a quality and the deep cultural roots that endlessly branch is a quality I want to promote.\\" She is also proud in representing her country by saying, \\"I am proud to be representing the United States because it is a country that I call my home, one that has given me brilliant experiences, and created so much opportunity. My parents came to the United States to give me choices, a chance to fulfill my dreams, and to become more than their best effort. They made this their new home away from family and comfort in pursuit of the American Dream; I think I represent that dream. My pride comes from acknowledging my parents‚Äô struggles and in seeing my achievements. The U.S. is a land of immigrants and limitless desires which I find is a unique characteristic and one so many others are proud of as well.\\" At the finals night of Miss Earth 2013 held in 7 December 2013, Nicolle finished as part of the top 16 semifinalists.

Cook's arrival in Hawaii was followed by mass migrations of Europeans and Americans to the islands that gave rise to the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, the aboriginal monarchy of the islands, beginning in 1893. Arrival James Cook led three separate voyages to chart unknown areas of the globe for the British Empire. It was on his third and final voyage that he encountered what is known today as the Islands of Hawaii. He first sighted the islands on 18 January 1778. He anchored off the west coast of the island of Kauai near Waimea and met inhabitants to trade and obtain water and food. On 2 February 1778, Cook continued on to the coast of North America and Alaska, mapping and searching for a Northwest Passage to the Atlantic Ocean for approximately nine months. He returned to the island chain to resupply, initially exploring the coasts of Maui and the big island and trading with locals, then making anchor in Kealakekua Bay in January 1779. Cook and his crew were initially welcomed and treated with honour, as his arrival coincided with the Makahiki season, an ancient New Year festival in honour of the god Lono of the Hawaiian religion, and a celebration of the yearly harvest. The idea or suggestion that the Native Hawaiians considered Cook to be the god Lono himself is considered to be inaccurate and is attributed to William Bligh. It is conceivable that some Hawaiians may have used the name of Lono as a metaphor when describing Cook or other possible explanations other than Hawaiians simply assuming the explorer was their own deity. However, after Cook and the crews of both ships, and , left the islands, the festival season had ended and the season for battle and war had begun under the worship and rituals for K≈´ka ªilimoku, the god of war. Although Cook's sequential visits may have coincided with native traditional seasons, the natives had by now soured on Cook and his men by the time of Cook's initial departure. John Ledyard was the only American aboard Cook's ship during this time and the only man aboard the ship not loyal to the British crown. Ledyard was present during the events leading up to and during Cook's death, and wrote a detailed account of the events in his journals. During Cook's initial visit, he attempted to barter with the natives and ordered his men to remove the wood used to border the natives' sacred \\"Morai\\" burial ground, used for high-ranking individuals and depictions of their gods. Ledyard says in his journals that Cook offered some iron hatchets for the wooden border around the Morai and when the dismayed and insulted chiefs refused, Cook proceeded to give orders to ascend the Morai, break down the fence and load the boats with it. John Ledyard also tells of an episode where Captain Clerke accused a native chieftain of stealing the Resolution's jolly boat. However, the boat was soon found and the native chief soured from the false accusation. After staying in the bay for 19 days, Cook and his two ships sailed out of the bay. On 6 February Cook's ships left Kealakekua Bay. They were soon met with an unexpected hard gale which wrenched the mainmast of the Resolution. On 11 February, the Resolution returned again to Kealakekua Bay to make repairs. Ledyard writes on 13 February: > Our return to this bay was as disagreeable to us as it was to the > inhabitants, for we were reciprocally tired of each other. They had been > oppressed and were weary of our prostituted alliance...It was also equally > evident from the looks of the natives as well as every other appearance that > our friendship was now at an end, and that we had nothing to do but to > hasten our departure to some different island where our vices were not > known, and where our intrinsic virtues might gain us another short space of > being wondered at. While the Resolution was anchored in Kealakekua Bay, one of its two longboats was stolen from the ship by the Hawaiians, testing the foreigners' reaction to see how far they could go with such a significant loss. The Hawaiians had begun openly challenging the foreigners. In retaliation, and in an attempt to enforce good behavior on the natives, Cook attempted to kidnap the ali ªi nui of the island of Hawaii, Kalani ª≈çpu ªu. Possibly being quite sick at this point, Cook made what were later described as a series of poor decisions. Attempt to take the ali ªi nui hostage On the following morning of 14 February 1779, Cook and his men launched from Resolution along with a company of armed marines. They went directly to the ruling chief's enclosure where Kalani ª≈çpu ªu was still sleeping. They woke him and directed him, urgently but without threat, to come with them. As Cook and his men marched the ruler out of the royal enclosure, Cook himself had hold of the elder chief as they walked away from the town towards the beach. Kalani ª≈çpu ªu's favorite wife, KƒÅnekap≈çlei, saw them as they were leaving and yelled after her husband but he ignored her and did not stop. She called to the other chiefs and the townspeople to alert them to the departure of her husband. Two chiefs, Kana ªina (Kalaimanokaho ªowaha), the young son of the former ruler, Keawe ªopala and Nuaa, the king's personal attendant, followed the group to the beach with the king's wife behind them pleading along the way for the ali ªi nui to stop and come back. By the time they got to the beach, Kalani ª≈çpu ªu's two youngest sons, who had been following their father believing they were being invited to visit the ship again with the ruler, began to climb into the boats waiting at the shore. KƒÅnekap≈çlei shouted to them to get out of the boat and pleaded with her husband to stop. The ruler then realized that Cook and his men were not asking him to visit the ship, but were attempting to abduct him. At this point he stopped and sat down. =Death of Cook= Kaawaloa in 1779 by John Webber, artist aboard Cook's ship Cook's men and the British Marines were confronted on the beach by an elderly kahuna who approached them holding a coconut and chanting. They yelled at the priest to go away, but he kept approaching them while singing the mele. When Cook and his men looked away from the old kahuna, they saw that the beach was now filled with thousands of Native Hawaiians. Cook told Kalani ª≈çpu ªu to get up but the ruler refused. As the townspeople began to gather around them, Cook and his men began to back away from the hostile crowd and raise their guns. The two chiefs and KƒÅnekap≈çlei shielded the ali ªi nui as Cook tried to force him to his feet. Kana ªina angrily approached Cook, who reacted by striking the chief with the flat side of his sword. Kana ªina jumped at Cook and grabbed him. Some accounts state that Kana ªina did not intend to hit Cook while other descriptions say the chief deliberately struck the navigator across the head with his leiomano. Either way, Kana ªina pushed Cook, who fell to the sand. As Cook attempted to get up, Nuaa lunged at him and fatally stabbed him in the chest with a metal dagger, obtained by trade from Cook's ship during the same visit. Cook fell with his face in the water. This caused a violent, close-quarters melee between the townspeople and Cook's men. Four of the Royal Marines (Corporal James Thomas and Privates Theophilus Hinks, Thomas Fachett, and John Allen) were killed and two were wounded. The remaining sailors and marines, heavily outnumbered, continued to fire as they retreated to their small boat and rowed back to their ship, injuring and killing several of the Native Hawaiians on the beach, including possibly High Chief Kana ªina. Cook's ships did not leave Kealakekua bay until 22 February. They remained for another week to continue repair of the mast and collect better quality drinking water. According to John Ledyard's journals, hundreds of natives were shot in a series of ongoing skirmishes. The ships cannon was used on several occasions against the natives, and a large portion of Kireekakooa, the southern town on the bay, was burned.

A breakthrough in the investigation came in early 1987 when new information was received by WA Police. Post a nationwide 6-month search by police detectives, on October 8 1987, Peter Munckton (33) was arrested in Darwin, Northern Territory, where he‚Äôd been residing whilst on parole after an armed-robbery conviction committed in Darwin on 15 July 1980.Queen & Peter Munckton/Kenneth Douglas, Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, 10.21am 7 November, 1980 Court documents, pertaining to the 1980 armed robbery trial, stated that Munckton, originally from Darwin, had left the city after completing an apprenticeship in mechanics in 1976 and then had travelled around Australia; finally arriving in Western Australia sometime in late 1977. It was during this time in Perth that Munckton had a serious motor-cycle accident resulting in extensive head injuries, subsequent epilepsy and loss of memory. For many months after the accident hospitalization was followed by out-patient and therapy treatment at Royal Perth Hospital.

Recording By 1974, Lewis's remarkable hot streak on the country charts began to cool. Although the single \\"He Can't Fill My Shoes\\" would make the Top 10, a second single, the foreboding \\"Tell Tale Signs,\\" only made it to number 18, and Lewis would not see the Top 10 again until 1976. The LP peaked at number 25 on Billboard's country albums chart, whereas his previous country album, 1973's Sometimes a Memory Ain't Enough, had risen to number 6. Part of the problem may have been that Lewis was becoming increasingly bored with the sweetened sound that was by now dominating his country albums, as biographer Rick Bragg explains in Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story: \\"The harder he tried to find a hit, it seemed, the more complicated - and less like him - the music became. The new music had a sophisticated, almost Hollywood sound, a style called countrypolitan that had put Charlie Rich back on the charts. Hard country like Jerry Lee's style was vanishing in a wash of saccharine strings, or so it seemed...He hated to sing in a booth over one of his own prerecorded backing tracks, but it was becoming routine.\\" Lewis was also still touring constantly and abusing his body with booze and pills, which would catch up with him as the decade wore on. One significant track on I-40 Country is \\"Room Full of Roses,\\" a song that would launch Jerry Lee's cousin Mickey Gilley to stardom. In 1974 alone, Gilley would score three number one country hits and, as Gilley's star rose while his own chart success dwindled in the seventies, \\"the Killer\\" did not mince words when it came to assessing his reverential cousin's talent compared to his own; in an interview with David Booth at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Toronto in 1976, which can be heard on the 1994 Bear Family box set The Locust Years, Lewis is asked about Gilley and, after joking that he didn't know him, said \\"Mickey Gilley is one of the finest gentlemen you'll ever meet, a great talent, a great man. He's worked hard all his life,\\" but then added that when people heard a Mickey Gilley record, they thought of him. Like Lewis and their cousin Jimmy Swaggart, Gilley was a talented pianist but, as Lewis told biographer Rick Bragg, \\"Neither one of them could touch me.\\"The Journal of Country Music - Volumes 13-15 - Page 28 1989 While I was there, I did two albums on Jerry Lee Lewis on Mercury [Sometimes a Memory Ain't Enough in 1973 and 1-40 Country in 1974].

Blinov was born to Beglopopovtsy parents and began to copy Old Believers manuscripts as a teenager. In 1905-1906 he was commissioned by the Nizhny Novgorod city council to study manuscript writing at the Solovetsky Monastery. In addition to this he also studied manuscript writing and calligraphy in various Russian museums and libraries. In 1909-1906 he worked at the Old Believers book publishers that belonged to L.A. Malekhonov, where Blinov oversaw publication of several important books and reprints. He also worked on private commissions, and among his clients were the House of Romanov, Russian Historical Museum and the Rumyantsev Museum. In 1916 Blinov was drafted to a military hospital.Blinov (Pravoslavnaia entsiklopediia) In 1919 Blinov became a member of the scholarly board of the Russian Historical Museum. In 1925 Blinov was forced to return to his home village due to family circumstances. In 1920-1930 he worked various jobs, was a member of a collective farm and continued to work on religious manuscripts as a hobby, while remaining under suspicion with the new secular government. Blinov created almost 200 manuscript books, most of them containing various religious texts. He also worked on preservation of several important manuscripts. In addition to this Blinov is known as a book illustrator, a graphic artist and a painter.

In his first session as a lawmaker he was the primary author of a new law which allows women in Oregon to buy oral contraception over the counter without a doctors prescription. Buehler was re-elected in 2016, narrowly defeating Democrat Gena Goodman-Campbell. Buehler describes himself as a moderate and his pro-choice stances on abortion have been a source of political tension \\"from left and right.\\" In July 2016, Buehler received a 65% rating from the American Conservative Union, although by November of that year it had dropped to 58%. In November 2017, Knute Buehler was the first Republican to call for the resignation of fellow Republican State Senator Jeff Kruse following multiple allegations of sexual harassment. = Ethics violations = The Democratic Party of Oregon Chair filed three ethics complaints against Buehler in the spring of 2017 regarding his campaign finance disclosures for the last four years. Two claims were dismissed by a state ethics committee. Buehler avoided civil penalties in the third complaint by acknowledging his violation of an Oregon statute which requires listing of all income received over $1,000 from any source as part of a state-mandated Letter of Education, along with restating his finance declarations retroactively to 2013. Buehler said the censure was \\"politically motivated,\\" the original filers claimed that \\"he continues to hide income.\\" =Gubernatorial campaign= Almost immediately after his re-election, Buehler was considered a front-runner for the Republican nomination to run for governor in 2018. Republicans claimed Democrats were already working to undercut Buehler through legislative committee assignments. On August 3, 2017, Buehler announced he would run for Governor of Oregon in the 2018 election. On May 15, 2018, Buehler won the Republican nomination for Governor of Oregon to face off against Democratic incumbent Kate Brown in November 2018, in a rematch of the 2012 Secretary of State election. Buehler lost the general election to Kate Brown by 6.4% Both Brown and Buehler raised and spent record amounts in their campaigns. = Political positions = State Rep. Buehler is a fiscally conservative moderate Republican. He is pro-choice on the issue of abortion. On immigration, he opposes sanctuary cities and opposes Oregon's statewide sanctuary policy. He supports gay rights, including same-sex marriage, and voted to ban conversion therapy from being used on minors. Buehler said during the gubernatorial campaign that he supported Oregon's capital punishment law which was passed by Oregon voters in 1984.

Background Following the conclusion of Operation Double Eagle, the ARVN 2nd Division received intelligence that the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 21st Regiment had moved into the area northwest of Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i. The plan was for the ARVN 1st Airborne Battalion to secure a landing zone at Chau Nhai, 15 km northwest of Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i and the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines would then deploy into the landing zone and then both Battalions would move southeast along Route 527 with the ARVN patrolling north and the Marines patrolling south of Route 527. Operation =4 March= On the morning of 4 March Marine A-4s and F-4s and U.S. Air Force B-57s carried out airstrikes on the landing zone before the helicopter landings commenced at 09:00, however the incoming helicopters of Marine Aircraft Group 36 were met with intense anti-aircraft fire and one UH-1E gunship of VMO-6 and an F-4 from VMFA-531 were shot down. Despite the persistent anti-aircraft fire by 10:30 the ARVN Airborne had been deployed to the landing zone and encountered little resistance on the ground. The landing of the Marines which commenced at approximately 10:40 was again met with heavy anti-aircraft fire and one UH-34 was shot down. By 13:00 the entire Battalion had been landed. As the ARVN moved out of the landing zone they encountered strong opposition around Chau Nhai and Hill 50 () and by 13:30 they had called for support from the Marines, who turned and moved to support the ARVN. As the Marines advanced on Hill 50 they came under intense fire from an estimated force of 2 PAVN Battalions, the lines were so close that the Marines were unable to call in air and artillery support. A gap developed between the Marines left flank and the ARVN as the ARVN refused to moved forward and the PAVN exploited this gap cutting off two platoons of Company F for several hours until supported by Company H. As darkness approached the Marines withdrew under the cover of air and artillery strikes to night-defensive positions. The PAVN probed the Marine positions at night and helicopter resupply missions were met with anti-aircraft fire. The Marines launched a night assault on an anti-aircraft position killing at least 20 PAVN and continuous air support and artillery fire was directed against PAVN positions and trails leading into the area. Realising that the PAVN planned to stand and fight, commanding general of Task Force Delta, Brigadier general Jonas M. Platt, ordered the deployment of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines north of 2/7 Marines and their deployment was completed by 18:00. In addition the next morning the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines was to be inserted 2.5 km south of 2/7 Marines, while the ARVN 37th Ranger Battalion supported by M113s would establish blocking positions to the east and the 5th Airborne Battalion would be landed in the original landing zone. =5 March= At 05:00 the PAVN launched an attack on the ARVN 1st Airborne position near Hill 50 and the Marine artillery responded with more than 1900 rounds on the perimeter over two hours. At 07:30 3/1 Marines was ordered to move south to support the ARVN. As the 3/1 Marines approached the ARVN position at 10:30 they came under heavy fire from entrenched PAVN forces on and around Hill 50. After more than 3 hours fighting the Company L 3/1 Marines and ARVN 1st Airborne captured Hill 50. Company M 3/1 Marines and ARVN 5th Airborne attempted to outflank PAVN positions east of Hill 50 but were unable to do so by nightfall and withdrew to night defensive positions. 3/1 Marines had lost 32 killed and 90 wounded during the day's fighting. At 08:30 2/4 Marines began landing and were met with intense anti-aircraft fire causing 2 UH-34s to crash-land in the landing zone. One Company stayed to provide security for the downed helicopters while the other two Companies moved north to the site of the previous day's engagement where they established night positions. At 23:00 Company B from the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines which had been moved into a blocking position northeast of the battle area was hit by intense PAVN mortar and small arms fire. Running short of ammunition the Marines called for an emergency resupply mission and despite heavy anti-aircraft fire two helicopters succeeded in dropping munitions to the Marines. At 01:30 the PAVN attacked the Marine perimeter but were forced back by small arms and artillery fire. =6 March= On the morning of 6 March the Marines and ARVN withdrew with minimal opposition from their night positions to allow for an air and artillery bombardment of the PAVN positions lasting more than 2 hours. When the bombardment concluded the Marines and ARVN advanced, but it became clear that most of the PAVN had slipped away the previous night. The Marines found more than 100 PAVN bodies on Hill 50 and an extensive tunnel and bunker complex inside the hill which had served as the PAVN Regimental command post. Aftermath Operation Utah concluded on 7 March, the Marines had suffered 98 dead and 278 wounded, the ARVN 30 killed and 120 wounded and the PAVN 600 killed and 5 captured.

It existed from 1909 to 1983. It was located in central Oklahoma, approximately 1 mile south of Concho, Oklahoma and 4 miles north of El Reno, Oklahoma. The name of the town and school is the Spanish word for \\"shell\\" and was named for the Indian agent, Charles E. Shell. Curriculum Concho was developed to provide a means of integrating and assimilating American Indian children into mainstream society. It, like other federal boarding schools, was run on a strict military model. Students were wakened at 5 a.m., performed military drills and formations, ate breakfast and were in class by 6:00 each morning. Academic subjects, including reading, writing, and arithmetic, were studied for half the day and the remainder of the day consisted of labor. Trades and farming were taught to boys and girls were taught domestic labor and nursing. A large experimental farm was maintained, where the children were instructed in conservation and planting techniques. Boys milked cows and girls helped prepare all of the meals and sewed clothing. Discipline was strict and infractions, like speaking in their native language rather than English, were punished by things like breaking large rocks into smaller rocks or sawing wood. Each infraction required punishment of one hour of labor. Initially, the school offered education to the 6th grade and students would have to transfer to Carlisle, Chilocco or Haskell Institute for secondary education. By around the 1920s, the school curriculum mirrored public education being offered throughout the country and included sports, music, art, and a full course of educational subjects. By the time the school closed in the early 1980s, it offered instruction for grades one - eight and was predominantly attended by orphans and students who had difficult home environments. History The first school was opened at the Darlington Agency on the Cheyenne-Arapaho Reservation in 1871 by the Hicksite (Liberal) Friends and Orthodox Quakers and was called the Cheyenne-Arapaho Boarding School. In 1872, the facility was built with federal funds, but run by the Quakers. Few Cheyenne children attended the school and as a means to entice them, a partition was erected to divide the classroom into separate areas for the Arapaho and Cheyenne students. In 1879 the facility was renamed the Arapaho Manual Labor and Boarding School and a new facility was built for the Cheyenne students located at Caddo Springs, which was called the Cheyenne Manual Labor and Boarding School. Within 5 years, it was reported that the children at the agency schools were responsible for raising 211 cattle and hogs and cultivating 130 acres of land. In 1881, a new school, called the Darlington Mission School was built and run by the General Conference Mennonites but a fire which occurred on 19 February 1882 destroyed the building, taking the life of the missionary's infant son and three Indian children. Federal funds and donations from the Mennonite Mission Board were secured to rebuild the mission school by December, 1882. The Mennonites had the same problems as the Quakers had had in trying educating the two tribes together, and opened a fourth school in 1882 called Cantonment. By 1884, the agent reported that attendance in the four schools represented 66 students at the Arapaho boarding school, 22 students at Cantonment, 71 students at the Cheyenne boarding school and 28 students at Darlington. After 1891 federal policy shifted and began to require more standardization, attendance quotas and less use of federal funds for church \\"contracted\\" institutions. By the mid 1890s only about half of the school-age children on the Cheyenne-Arapaho Reservation were attending school. An experiment with enrolling Indian children in the public school system and offsetting the costs to the schools was attempted in 1896-1897, but was discontinued. Declining attendance at Darlington forced its permanent closure in June, 1898 and Cantonment closed in 1901. In 1908 both the Arapaho Manual Labor and Boarding School and the Cheyenne Manual Labor and Boarding School were closed and the facilities sold by the government. The Darlington Agency was also closed and relocated to Concho in 1909. The new school Concho Boarding School opened in 1909 and re- implemented the farming model, which continued during the Great Depression. In 1932 the Seger Indian Training School, which had incorporated the students of the Red Moon School in 1917, closed and its students were transferred to Concho. Total Concho Boarding School students for 1932 were 133 boys and 117 girls.Dias (1933), p 12 However, the school struggled during the Dust Bowl period, where between 1933 and 1937 there were 362 dust storms in the immediate area, coupled with tornadoes and flash flooding. As part of the Works Progress Administration President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an Executive Order in 1933 which authorized the Indian Service to establish a Civilian Conservation Corps camp at Concho to improve the grounds and buildings, implement soil erosion controls, and develop water resources. The agency buildings were razed and rebuilt in 1933 and a hospital was constructed in 1941. The era of the federal Indian Termination Policy from the 1940s through the 1960s saw threats to close tribal schools and Concho was not immune. Richard Boynton and George Levi, of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes Business Committee and Robert Goombi of the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma sent pleas to Oklahoma Congressmen to fight school closure. The bid to save the school was successful as some of the buildings were converted into a facility to assist troubled students in 1962. In 1968, a new school complex was built for the boarding school, featuring a pioneering teaching program which was to be operated in conjunction with Southwestern State College. The program was designed to overcome language and cultural barriers and offer Indian students access to college materials and individual instruction. The school was closed after the graduation ceremonies held 14 May 1982 due to federal budget cuts. Though parents and the tribe protested the closure and obtained an injunction to stop it, at the end of the 1983 school term, the school permanently closed. The school buildings were returned to the tribe from the BIA in 1985 for use as business enterprises. In 2015, plans were in the works to convert some of the buildings to a fitness center. Concho Demonstration School In 1962, a new system for streamlining troubled students back into the school systems was set up. Earl C Intolubbe, a Choctaw who was working as an Education Guidance Specialist for the Bureau of Indian Affairs set up a model school at Concho. The idea was to keep classrooms small so that children received individual attention. Students who had dropped out of other schools were placed in the special program. Some returned within weeks or months to their prior boarding schools or public schools, and some stayed for years.

It has been in publication since 1974, when it was founded following the collapse of The Erindalian. It primarily covers UTM news, with occasional forays into University of Toronto tri-campus news and Mississauga news. The Medium is published by Medium II Publications, a non- profit Ontario corporation founded in 1986 in the wake of disagreements with the Erindale College Student Union. It is funded partly by a student levy and partly through advertising sales. The corporation has also published Medium Magazine nearly annually since 2010, and run a blog division since 2013.  History  In the spring of 1974, The Erindalian, then the student newspaper of the University of Toronto's Mississauga campus, which had been established less than a decade prior, collapsed due to a lack of funding . A student named Greg Troy, enrolled under the pseudonym Gregg-Michael Troy, founded what was then called medium II along with a number of friends. The first issue was published as a proposal to the student council for funding, with a cover story on the murder of Constance Dickey on Erindale Campus. They were awarded funding and proceeded to publish throughout the academic year. Towards the end of the year, Troy resigned during a successful campaign for the presidency of the student council, and Harry Vredenberg took his place. Early editor-in- chief Bruce Dowbiggin's conflicts with ECSU, the student union by then established in place of the council, was representative of tensions that would arise for decades to follow. These tensions culminated in the 1986 incorporation that separated the publisher from the union's umbrage. A board and constitution were established, and all equipment was bought from the union for the nominal fee of $1. In 1995, medium II changed its name to The Medium; the incorporated name is still Medium II Publications. In 2000, the first website was established. In 2010, Medium editors began to publish the annual Medium Magazine, a higher-quality print publication made up of long-form features. In 2013, the corporation created positions for blog editors with the responsibility of creating a secondary stream of informal, online-only content. In 2014, a video editor position was added, followed by a managing editor in 2015.  Masthead  The Medium is published in five sections: News, Opinion, Arts, Features, and Sports. Each section has an editor in charge, with the exception of Opinion, which is managed by the editor-in-chief. A photography editor, design editor, advertising manager, distribution manager, webmaster, and copy editor make up the remaining part of the staff, along with the more recent and experimental blog, online, and video editors. Most of the positions are elected annually, mainly those in charge of content; the rest are hired from the student population. Most of the writers are volunteers, and can earn the title of staff writer or associate editor while writing. Bookkeeping is handled externally.  Operations  In keeping with its constitution and the Ontario requirements for non-profit corporations, Medium II Publications holds an annual audit and annual general meeting. It also holds the occasional writing and photography contest. The corporation is considered a student society in the university's taxonomy for the purpose of distributing the student levy, whose conditions include financial record- keeping, an audit, and constitutionality. The content does not involve any administrative oversight, although a university liaison holds a non-voting seat on the board of directors. The board's remaining positions are made up five elected students, the elected editor-in-chief, and a non-voting appointed ex-officio seat.

The band released their first extended play, Fuck Your Emotional Bullshit, in 2009 via Square Of Opposition Records.

We had a blast writing songs, driving across the country playing shows, imbibing copious amounts of alcohol, and earning future grey hairs by reading all about ourselves on message boards. Thanks for everything.\\"The band broke up following its first and only full US tour with its last ever show selling out in a matter of minutes. The breakup was due to frontman Galm's music- writing veering towards more indie rock and wanting to explore different avenues. The band reunited in 2016 for two shows, one for the World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die's Broken World Fest in Pittsburgh, the second for Square of Opposition Records' 15th anniversary. The band said that these would be their final shows. However, the band reunited in 2019 for a brief tour in Japan. Also in 2019, guitarist Brazuk made a post on the band's Facebook page announcing that she had come out as a transgender woman and changed her name from Ross to Willow.

Also it has meaning: \\"Punya means that which is not decomposed; punya is original....\\" Bhagavad Gita as it is chapter 7, verse 9,purport Overview Punya (‡§™‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø,) is referred to as good karma or a virtue that contributes benefits in this and the next birth and can be acquired by appropriate means and also accumulated. In Vedanta terms punya is the invisible wealth, a part of dharma, the first of four human goals; the other three goals being artha, kama and moksha. Punya and pƒÅpa are the seeds of future pleasure and pain, the former, which sows merits, exhausts itself only through pleasure and the latter, which sows demerits, exhausts itself only through pain; but Jiwan mukti ends all karmic debts consisting of and signified by these two dynamics. During the Vedic period, brahmacharya practiced by the Brahmins was believed to ensure the desired gain of eternal life but owing to the changes in living patterns and increase in the demands of life, people veered towards Brahmaloka which the accumulation of merits of punya-karma ('good deeds or actions') seemed to promise and opted for the deva-yƒÅna or 'the path of the gods'. The dynamics of karma played a large role in the development of Buddhist thought. The Buddhists believe that karma determines one‚Äôs nature and life-pattern but to them karma is chetnƒÅ, a mental drive, a psychological phenomenon rather than a law governing substantial existence. The Buddhists consider Punya as the extraordinary force that confers happiness, as a spiritual merit which is one of the ten forms of balas (sources of strength) to a bodhisattva. They hold the belief that charity leads to the accumulation of punya or a happier rebirth on earth or a long sojourn in heaven. Buddha-knowledge (enlightenment) transcends even the law of karma. The principle of Sthiti Bandha (duration-quality bondage), according to Jainism, involves attachment of karmic matter to the soul through anubhava bandha or rasa bandha which refers to the determination of the fruits of actions of the soul that such an attachment produces at the time of attachment of karmic matter or through pradesha bandha that deals with the quantum of karmic matter drawn towards the soul as determined by the soul‚Äôs actions. The karmic matter produced due to good activities of the mind, body and speech is the pleasant punya ('virtuous') karmic matter and that produced due to evil activities is the unpleasant pƒÅpa ('sinful') karmic matter. These karmas have to exhaust themselves to produce their results. The NyƒÅya School understands dharma and adharma to refer to punya and pƒÅpa, with punya relating to one‚Äôs own or others‚Äô well-being and pƒÅpa relating to harm done to others, or in terms of doing one‚Äôs duties and their violation; it connects dharma to well- being and duty. The concept of Karma, with the idea of rebirth as the background, was effectively introduced into Indian thought by Yajnavalkya in the course of his discussion with JƒÅratkƒÅrva ƒÄrtabhƒÅga who wanted to know about what happens after death (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad III.ii.13), whether present actions matter in respect of the experience of the after-death state and how human efforts and karma are inter-related. The Vedic people were multi-religious and believed in the existence of heaven and hell and in the transmigration of souls. For them the performance of yajna was important, and no yajna was complete or fruitful without dakshina i.e. the fee to the priests, and dƒÅna i.e. charity, both deemed meritorious acts or punya-karma; they accepted the philosophy of sin (pƒÅpa) and merit (punya). Punya is a very ancient Sanskrit word which appears in the Rig veda. For instance, in a prayer to Kapinjala Ivendro Devata, Rishi Gutsamada, while describing the qualities of an upadeshaka ('teacher') states: :‡§â‡§¶‡•ç‡§ó‡§æ‡§§‡•á‡§µ ‡§∂‡§ï‡•Å‡§®‡•á ‡§∏‡§Ç ‡§ó‡§æ‡§Ø‡§∏‡§ø ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§™‡•Å‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§á‡§µ ‡§∏‡§µ‡§®‡•á‡§∑‡•Å ‡§∂‡§Ç‡§∏‡§∏‡§ø  :‡§µ‡•É‡§∑‡•á‡§µ ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ú‡•Ä ‡§∂‡§ø‡§∂‡•Å‡§Æ‡§§‡•Ä‡§∞‡§™‡•Ä‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§§‡•ã ‡§®‡§É ‡§∂‡§ï‡•Å‡§®‡•á ‡§≠‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§æ‡§µ‡§¶ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§§‡•ã ‡§®‡§É ‡§∂‡§ï‡•Å‡§®‡•á ‡§™‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§µ‡§¶  - (Rig Veda II.43.2) in which mantra the word, punya, is used to mean - 'good' or 'auspicious' or 'happy'. Many other Vedic texts, such as Chandogya Upanishad (VIII.ii.6) ‚Äì ‡§™‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ú‡§ø‡§§‡•ã ‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï‡§É (in which phrase aja refers to the Brahmaloka), have used it as meaning 'agreeable' or 'happy'. Otherwise, in Sanskrit literature, this word is used to indicate 'advantageous', 'good', 'convenient', 'beneficent' or 'purifying'; Manusm·πõti also uses it meaning the same; however, the opposite of punya is apunya, which means that the word, punya cannot at all places be translated as 'merit' or 'meritorious', more so because the word pƒÅpa is most often translated as 'sin'. Adi Shankara exclaims:- :‡§™‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡§ø ‡§™‡§æ‡§™‡§æ‡§®‡§ø ‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§®‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡•á‡§§‡§∏‡•ã ‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡•á‡§É ‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡§æ‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡•á‡§É  :‡§ï‡•Å‡§§‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ñ‡§£‡•ç‡§°‡§∏‡•Å‡§ñ‡§æ‡§®‡•Å‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡•á‡§É ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ç‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø‡§®‡§®‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§ó‡§§ ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§™‡§ø ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Å‡§§‡§ø‡§É  :\\"How can there be for me pu·πáya and pƒÅpa who am without organs, without mind, without change and without form? How can these pertain to me who enjoy infinite bliss? The ananvƒÅgata≈õruti also declares that these will not attend on me.\\" ‚Äî Vivekachudamani (St.504) In his commentary on this stanza, ≈öri Candra≈õekhara BhƒÅratƒ´ of ≈öringeri explains that punya is the outcome of doing prescribed works, and pƒÅpa, the prohibited. All works pertaining to the body, to the mind and to speech are karma, the good and bad with reference to actions make for punya and pƒÅpa respectively; all actions and their outcome relate to the mind or to the body with form possessing sense-organs. The infinite bliss that Shankara speaks of is the sukha not generated by connection with sense-objects and therefore, in its experience there is no grief, no superimposition and no imagination whatsoever. During the Vedic period speaking untruth was a sin, and false accusers were the real sinners; performance of yajna washed away all such sins, which means ritual acts were associated with morality. Untruth and impurity could be washed away by water or wiped away by Darbha grass. Along with the concept of Rta (righteousness) there was the more prominent concept of anrta, the opposite of righteousness or untruth; terms for good and evil were developed and a wicked person was called pƒÅpa, where after from the term, sƒÅdhu denoting what was right, was the concept of punya developed. Yajnavalkya explains ‚Äì :‡§Ø‡§•‡§æ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§Ø‡§•‡§æ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§§‡§•‡§æ ‡§≠‡§µ‡§§‡§ø ‡§∏‡§æ‡§ß‡•Å‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§æ‡§ß‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§≠‡§µ‡§§‡§ø, ‡§™‡§æ‡§™‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§™‡§æ‡§™‡•ã ‡§≠‡§µ‡§§‡§ø ‡§™‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§É ‡§™‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§® ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§£‡§æ ‡§≠‡§µ‡§§‡§ø, ‡§™‡§æ‡§™‡§É ‡§™‡§æ‡§™‡•á‡§®  :\\"As it (the self) does and acts, so it becomes; by doing good it becomes good, and by doing evil it becomes evil.\\" - (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (IV.iv.5) In his commentary, Shankara states that the 'doing good' referred to here is the prescribed conduct (scriptural injunctions and prohibitions), actions are not prescribed for acts, good or evil prompted by desire and the cause of identification and transmigration, do not require habitual performance.

Background Born in Schenectady, New York, Yanai earned her bachelor's degree from Syracuse University. She earned her master's degree in social work from the University of Minnesota. She was working in Minneapolis as a social worker when she met her future husband, Hideyasu Steve Yanai, a chemist and native of Japan. They were married in 1956 and they moved to Moorestown, New Jersey in 1958. Career In the 1960s, Yanai organized a project to study conservation issues for the League of Women Voters. This led, in 1972, to her helping to found, and then later becoming the president of, the citizens' group Save the Environment of Moorestown (STEM). She was on the Moorestown Environmental Advisory Committee and helped in the creation of this organization. She was active with the Pompeston Watershed Association. She also served on the Moorestown planning board for 16 years. Yanai drove the creation of a natural resource inventory (NRI) for the Township, a process that took ten years. In 1988, the NRI was finally adopted as an appendix to the Township Master plan. She was the driving force behind an open space inventory for Moorestown's first Open Space Committee. She worked with local artists to create banners that celebrated every open space. She campaigned for the Green Acres bond issues and worked on many public education events. Legacy A 34-acre property near Albury Court on Garwood Road has been named in her honor. It was preserved as a Moorestown Open Space in October 2004. It is primarily wetlands and includes some vernal pools. Awards *2009 Honoree of the National Women‚Äôs History Month Death Yanni died at the age of 75 on October 15, 2003 of cancer. She died at her daughter's home in Syracuse, New York. She is survived by her husband, her daughters, Ruth and Nina, and her granddaughter, Nora.

Rayfield is an American politician, who is a member of the Democratic Party. Rayfield was first elected in 2014 and currently serves in the Oregon House of Representatives, representing House District 16, comprising Corvallis and Philomath. Early life and education Rayfield was born in Orange County, California. After moving to Oregon, he attended Oregon public schools including Linnwood Elementary School, Fowler Middle School, and Tigard High School. Rayfield later graduated from Western Oregon University in 2003 and went on to earn his law degree from Willamette University College of Law.  Legal Practice  While in law school Rayfield worked as a clerk with the Benton County District Attorney's Office gaining trial experience prosecuting misdemeanors and DUIIs. After law school Rayfield began his legal career working for the Weatherford Thompson law firm in Albany, Oregon. His practice initially focused on general civil litigation. In 2007, Rayfield served as the plaintiff's attorney in a high profile case involving a police officer that wrongfully arrested several individuals under false DUII accusations. Following a successful resolution to the case, Rayfield worked to help pass HB 2318 during the 2009 legislative session of the Oregon Legislative Assembly. HB 2318 allowed people who were falsely accused of driving under the influence to remove the false charge from their record. The bill passed unanimously in the Oregon House and Senate and was signed into law by Governor on June 18, 2009. In May 2009 Rayfield joined the law firm of Nelson & MacNeil. His practice focused on representing individuals with claims against corporations, insurance companies, and other bad actors. In 2014, Rayfield became a partner with the law firm changing the firm‚Äôs name to Nelson MacNeil Rayfield Trial Attorneys PC. Political career Rayfield was sworn in as a State Representative from House District 16 on January 12, 2015. Legislative Committees and 2015-16 Sessions During the 2015 Legislative Session, Rayfield served on the House Committee on Rules, the Joint Committee on Ways and Means, as Co-Chair of the Joint Ways and Means Subcommittee on Natural Resources, and as Vice Chairman of the House Committee on Consumer Protection and Government Effectiveness. During the session Rayfield acted as a key facilitator, successfully negotiating a bipartisan solution to shore-up a $30 million shortfall with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife budget. Following the 2015 Legislative Session, Rayfield was elected by his colleagues to serve as House Majority Whip. During the interim in 2015 Rayfield was also appointed Co-Chair of the Joint Committee on Ways and Means Subcommittee on Public Safety. In the 2016 Legislative Session, Rayfield sponsored several key bills that were eventually signed into law. In particular, he successfully shepherded legislation extending unemployment insurance benefits for up to an additional 6 months to locked-out workers, which immediately impacted 180 Steelworkers locked-out of the ATI plant in Albany, OR. Awards and Accolades Rayfield was named a \\"Rising Star\\" by the Oregon League of Conservation Voters (OLCV) in its 2015 Environmental Scorecard. He was recognized by OLCV for his work as Co-Chair of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Natural Resources, and specifically his efforts to forge compromise to address a $30 million budget shortfall for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. In 2015, Rayfield was also chosen by the Council of State Governments West (CSG West), a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization serving state legislators of both parties in 13 Western states, as a participant in its prestigious training institute for lawmakers in their first four years of service.  Personal life  Rayfield lives in Corvallis with his wife Amanda and their son Adam. His mother was an activist and small business owner that reveled in dragging her son to events promoting progressive causes throughout his youth. His father, a retired Colonel in the Air Force Reserve and commercial insurance executive had more conservative views. In the community Rayfield has served numerous roles including Commissioner on the Linn-Benton Housing Authority, member of the New Roots Housing Board, Past-President of the Linn-Benton Bar Association, Past-Chair of the Linn and Benton Judicial Screening Committee, Past-President of the Majestic Theater Management Board, former Linn County Peer Court Judge, and former coach of the Oregon State University Mock Trial Team.

Brooklyn Bridge was exhibited at the Montross Gallery, New York, 1916 (no. 40) along with works by Jean Crotti, Marcel Duchamp and Jean Metzinger.Exhibition of pictures by Jean Crotti, Marcel Duchamp, Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Montross Gallery, New York, April 4 to April 22, 1916 This is the first in a series of three highly abstract paintings by Gleizes of the Brooklyn Bridge.Daniel Robbins, Albert Gleizes, From Grove Art Online, Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York, Oxford University Press, 2009Daniel Robbins, 1964, Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition, Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund. It was the most abstract painting of the bridge to date. Gleizes and the Italian- American artist Joseph Stella had been friends since 1915 and it has been of interest to compare this painting with Stella's Brooklyn Bridge of 1919-20. The American collector John Quinn acquired Brooklyn Bridge and several other works by Gleizes that had been on view at Montross Gallery, either during the exhibition or subsequently. In 1927, an exhibition and sale of Quinn's art collection took place in New York City. The sale was conducted by Otto Bernet and Hiram H. Parke at the American Art Galleries. A catalogue was published for the occasion by the American Art Association. Brooklyn Bridge (n. 263 of the catalogue) was purchased at the sale for $60.Paintings and sculptures, The renowned collection of modern and ultra-modern art formed by the late John Quinn, Exhibition and sale at the American Art Galleries, Sale conducted by Bernet and Parke, Published by American Art Association, New York, 1927 Brooklyn Bridge forms part of the Solomon R.

Way, Brooklyn Bridge, c.1888, Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn Public Library George Bradford Brainerd, The Brooklyn Bridge from Train, Brooklyn NY, between 1870 and 1889, Brooklyn Museum Brooklyn Bridge is an oil and gouache painting on canvas with dimensions 102 x 102 cm (40 1/8 x 40 1/8 inches) inscribed \\"Brooklyn Bridge, Alb. Gleizes, 15, lower right. In a celebration of this feat of modernity, the architecture of the Brooklyn Bridge served as the inspiration for a series of works by Gleizes. In this first painting of the series, juxtaposed arabesques and distinctive diagonals interconnect dynamically, suggesting the bridge's complex architectonic engineering.Albert Gleizes, On Brooklyn Bridge (Sur Brooklyn Bridge), Guggenheim Museum, New York As in earlier works by Gleizes, this canvas is directly engaged with the environment. While highly abstract, Brooklyn Bridge maintains an evident visual basis. From 1914 to the end of the New York period, however nonrepresentational, works by the artist continued to be shaped by his personal experience, by the conviction that art was a social function, susceptible to theoretical formulation, and imbued with optimism.Daniel Robbins, 1964, Albert Gleizes 1881 ‚Äì 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition. Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund In Du \\"Cubisme\\" Gleizes and Metzinger wrote: \\"...let us admit that the reminiscence of natural forms cannot be banished‚Äîin any event, not yet. An art cannot be raised to the level of pure effusion at the first step.\\"Du \\"Cubisme\\", Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, Paris, Figui√®re, 1912 Three years later, the transformation toward pure effusion would manifest itself in the Brooklyn Bridge and continue further still in subsequent works produced by the artist in New York. The features of the bridge are described by forceful rhythms and colors, even though the actual bridge itself has disappeared; superseded by a synthesis of Gleizes's plastic equivalents of physical reality. The three Brooklyn Bridge paintings are a prime example of Gleizes's experimentation with the plastic translation of one of his most treasured themes: the city which draws life from the river. Already, in his 1913 publication The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations, Guillaume Apollinaire drew parallels between the work of Gleizes and the realization of metal constructions such as bridges: :Majesty: this is what, above all, characterizes the art of Albert Gleizes. He thus brings a startling innovation to contemporary art. Something that before him was found in but few of the modern painters.The Little Review: Quarterly Journal of Art and Letters, Vol. 9, No. 1: Stella Number, editor: Margaret C. Anderson, New York, 1922-09 (Autumn 1922), pp. 41-59\\\\. The Modernist Journals Project, Brown University and The University of TulsaHerschel Browning Chipp, Peter Selz, Theories of Modern Art: A Source Book by Artists and Critics, University of California Press, 1968, pp. 221-248, :This majesty arouses and provokes the imagination; considered from the plastic point of view, it is the immensity of things. :This art is vigorous. The pictures of Albert Gleizes are realized by a force of the same sort as that which realized the Pyramids and the Cathedrals, the constructions in metal, the bridges and the tunnels. (Apollinaire, 1913) Background Gleizes stated his admiration for the Brooklyn Bridge in the first interview after his arrival in the United States, comparing it to the noblest achievements of European architecture. The Brooklyn Bridge was a key component of the New York landscape for the Ashcan School, though it hadn't held for them the fascination that it did for the generation of modern artists that arrived or returned from Europe during the First World War.Lewis Kachur, The Bridge As Icon, Brooklyn Museum Joseph Stella wrote of the Brooklyn Bridge: \\"Seen for the first time, as a weird metallic Apparition under a metallic sky, out of proportion with the winged lightness of its arch, traced for the conjunction of Worlds‚Ä¶ it impressed me as the shrine containing all the efforts of the new civilization of America\\".Joseph Stella, The Brooklyn Bridge (A page of my life), transition 16, June 1929, p. 87. Albert Gleizes remarked: \\"the genius who built the Brooklyn Bridge is to be classed alongside the genius who built Notre Dame de Paris\\".Albert Gleizes quoted in The Literary Digest, 51, November 27, 1915, p. 1225 Supporting Gleizes' claim that the Brooklyn Bridge belongs in the same category as the Notre Dame Cathedral, Marcel Duchamp said America's greatest works of art are its bridges and its plumbing. (Stella and Walter Arensberg accompanied Duchamp to a plumbing supply store in 1917 to purchase the infamous urinal, soon to be entitled Fountain and signed \\"R.Mutt\\").Calvin Tomkins, Marcel Duchamp: A Biography, Henry Holt, New York, 1996, p. 181. Joseph Stella, 1919-20, Brooklyn Bridge, oil on canvas, 215.3 x 194.6 cm, Yale University Art Gallery Whereas other proto-modernists such as Henry James, H. G. Wells and Alvin Langdon Coburn pondered the bridge from a distance‚Äîcontemplating its cultural and industrial aspects‚Äîartists like John Marin, Max Weber, Joseph Stella and Gleizes worked directly at the bridge itself, reveling in the personal experience.Richard Haw, Art of the Brooklyn Bridge: A Visual History, Routledge, 2 October 2012 This is what Alan Trachtenberg called ‚Äúthe classic moment‚Äù when the bridge‚Äîin front of the eyes‚Äîtransforms itself from a public icon to ‚Äúa private event‚Äù. The classic moment is not studied or pondered but entirely instant and radically subjective. It is a personal response to modernity of the unique structure, an attempt to ‚Äúknow the bridge from the inside‚Äù.Alan Trachtenberg, Brooklyn Bridge: Fact and Symbol, Chicago, London, University of Chicago Press, p.96 Stemming back to his years at the Abbaye de Cr√©teil, the interest in ambitious subjects continued to inspire Albert Gleizes throughout the 1910s: Passy, Bridges of Paris, La Chasse (The Hunt), Harvest Threshing (Le D√©piquage des Moissons), Les Joueurs de football (Football Players). From 1915, Gleizes drew inspiration from the music of jazz, from the skyscrapers of New York, from neon signs, from the hustle and bustle of busy Manhattan streets and avenues such as Broadway, and from the Brooklyn Bridge; expressing the various sensations and vast drama of modern city life in an unprecedented series of works.Peter Brooke, Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953 Albert Gleizes, 1915, Composition for \\"Jazz\\", oil on cardboard, 73 x 73 cm, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York During the months of autumn, following his demobilization in 1915, Gleizes married Juliette Roche and moved to New York. There they were met by Carlos Salzedo, Francis Picabia, Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp, and Jean Crotti (who would eventually marry Suzanne Duchamp). Marcel Duchamp had emigrated to New York several months earlier after being judged physically unfit for his service in the military. Shortly after his arrival, Gleizes, accompanied by Salzedo, frequented jazz clubs in Harlem. With all it had to offer, New York had a strong impact on the artist's production. Gleizes had previously been to New York for the occasion of the Armory Show (which in 1913 introduced European modern art to an American audience), exhibiting his La Femme aux Phlox (Woman with Phlox)‚Äô‚Äô, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and L'Homme au Balcon, Man on a Balcony (Portrait of Dr. Th√©o Morinaud)‚Äô‚Äô, Philadelphia Museum of Art. In New York Gleizes met Walter Pach (who he knew from Paris), Stuart Davis, Max Weber, Joseph Stella, and participated in a show at Montross Gallery (April 1916)‚Äîexhibiting Brooklyn Bridge‚Äîwith Duchamp, Crotti and Metzinger (who remained in Paris). At this exhibition the group was dubbed 'The Four Musketeers' in the press.John Yau, Jean Croti, Inhabiting Abstraction, The Brooklyn Rail, 2011Laurette E. McCarthy, Walter Pach, Walter Pach (1883-1958): The Armory Show and the Untold Story of Modern Art in America, Penn State Press, 2011 The Montross exhibition introduced some of the most avant-garde French art of the time to the New York art scene, causing a sensation and once again forcing American artists to rethink their ideas about art. This exhibitions demonstrated that there existed an even more radical approach in art than that offered by the Futurists and Cubists, who were considered at the time to represent the most extreme forms of art.Francis M. Naumann, Conversion to Modernism, Chapter Seven, The Art of Painting in Two Dimensions, Part 2: The Paintings, Drawings, Watercolors, and Collages of 1916 Edgar S. Thomson, Brooklyn Bridge, 1895, Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn Public Library Painters suspended on cables of the Brooklyn Bridge, 7 October 1914 After Gleizes returned to Europe, Stella became interested in the Bridge as a motif. In Paris, from 1911 to 1912, Stella had been in contact with the Cubists and Italian Futurists, who admired contemporary concepts of the future, including motion, speed and technological triumphs of humanity over nature. When he return to New York he moved to Brooklyn and there found in the Bridge the perfect vehicle for his Futurist vision, though he was also interested in the structural experiments of the Cubists and the dynamic color of the Fauves.Barbara Haskell, Joseph Stella, Whitney Museum of American Art (exhibition catalogue), New York, 1994, p. 88 Abstraction Gleizes' Brooklyn Bridge (his first painting of the bridge) was the most abstract image made of the bridge to date. His second version, also of 1915, measuring 148.1 x 120.4 cm (58¬º x 47 3/8in.), is entirely abstract.Albert Gleizes, 1915, Brooklyn Bridge, oil and sand on cardboard, 148.1 x 120.4 cm (58¬º x 47 3/8in.), Christie's London, Impressionist and Modern Evening Sale, Lot 14, 25 June 2002 His third and last oil painting of the series, dated 1917 and entitled On Brooklyn Bridge (Sur Brooklyn Bridge), Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, measures 161.8 x 129.5 cm (63 3/4 x 51 in.). This composition relates most closely with a 1915 drawing (25 x 19 cm). It is an attempt to synthesize New York City under the symbol of the bridge through a collection of unifying circles, spheres and arcs. In the composition Gleizes portrays both ends of the bridge with the East River below. The Manhattan skyline and Brooklyn appear in the distance. This 1917 canvas‚Äîthe least abstract of the three‚Äîmore so than the other paintings of the series, resembles Stella's 1919-20 painting. Non-objective painting rarely has to do with realistic qualities and yet it is still bound to the logic of painting as representational of the subject matter. In Andrei Nakov's study, Abstract/Concrete - Russian and Polish Non-objective Art, non-representation itself becomes the impetus for depicting a subject. In his last book, Painting and on Man become Painter, written in 1948, Gleizes warns against the trend of non-representation becoming an end unto itself, insisting on the importance, instead, of esemplastic qualities. For Gleizes, the latter prevails over the concepts of representational or abstract qualities of the painting. Toward the end of 1913 Gleizes defended the need for a representational subject matter in 'Opinion' published by Ricciotto Canudo in Monjoie!, but it was for reasons that were entirely plastic and non-representational at the same time: > We are agreed that anecdote counts for nothing in a painted work. It is a > pretext, so be it, but a pretext which we should not reject. Through a > certain coefficient of imitation we will verify the legitimacy of the things > we have discovered, the picture will not be reduced to the merely > pleasurable arabesque of an oriental carpet, and we will obtain an infinite > variety which would otherwise be impossible. (Gleizes, 1913) In The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form, Gleizes writes: > As we can see straightaway, it is not a matter of describing, nor is it a > matter of abstracting from, anything that is external to itself. There is a > concrete act that has to be realized, a reality to be produced - of the same > order as that which everyone is prepared to recognize in music, at the > lowest level of the esemplastic scale, and in architecture, at the > highest.The hierarchy of esemplastic acts is a primary theme of the > theoretical Essai de G√©n√©ralisation which Gleizes intended to attach to The > Epic, From immobile form to mobile form when it was published by the Bauhaus > Like any natural, physical reality, painting, understood in this way, will > touch anyone who knows how to enter into it, not through their opinions on > something that exists independently of it, but through its own existence, > through those inter-relations, constantly in movement, which enable us to > transmit life itself. (Gleizes, 1928)Albert Gleizes, The Epic, From immobile > form to mobile form, published in a German version in 1928, under the title > Kubismus, in Bauhausb√ºcher. The French version was published as L‚ÄôEpop√©e > (The Epic), in the journal Le Rouge et le Noir, 1929.

Early career The youngest of seven children in Wollaston, Tom Southall was born to Thomas Richard Southall, Sr. and his wife, Mary, both of Stourbridge. He became a merchant marine officer and went to New Zealand in 1898.Linda Moffatt, \\"Skidmore Colliers and Innkeepers of Amblecote, and Potmakers of Stourbridge\\", 2013, p. 13. He moved from Christchurch to New Plymouth early in 1908 to work for the Roads and Bridges Department.Taranaki Herald, 30 January 1908, p. 5. In September 1908, Southall was appointed inaugural captain of the United Service club in the North Taranaki Cricket Association.Taranaki Herald, 5 September 1908, p. 5. In the 1908-09 season of Saturday afternoon cricket he took 123 wickets for 467 runs, at an average of 3.79.Taranaki Daily News, 11 March 1909, p. 4. A tall left-arm spinner \\"with a peculiar twist in his delivery\\",Evening Post, 16 November 1912, p. 14. Southall usually opened the bowling. In his first match representing his region, for North Taranaki against Manawatu in 1909-10, he took 6 for 46 and 5 for 20 in North Taranaki's victory.Taranaki Daily News, 30 December 1909, p. 4.Taranaki Herald, 30 December 1909, p. 7. Later that season, in a two-day match between a Taranaki 15 and the touring Australians, Southall, bowling unchanged throughout, took 6 for 78 and 5 for 49, bowling nine of his 11 victims, including several Test players. Chasing 156 for victory, the Australians were 138 for eight, with \\"Southall sending down deadly deceptive breaks like a book\\", when the Australian batsmen appealed against the light and play was called off.Taranaki Daily News, 24 March 1910, p. 8. In 1909 government retrenchments forced him out of the civil service and he began work as a sharebroker in New Plymouth. The business was not successful, and he faced bankruptcy proceedings in December 1910 and January 1911 with debts of around ¬£500.Taranaki Daily News, 7 December 1910, p. 7; 19 January 1911, p. 8. He moved to Wellington in 1912, working in newspaper marketing. He was immediately successful for the Wellington North club, who won the championship in 1912-13, when Southall set a Wellington Cricket Association record by taking 69 wickets, at an average of 10.40.Auckland Star, 23 April 1913, p. 3. He took five wickets for Wellington against the visiting South Melbourne in December 1912. Harry Trott, the South Melbourne captain, noting that there had been some questioning of the fairness of Southall's bowling action, wrote: \\"He certainly pushes the ball as it leaves his hand, but it is not a throw, and, in my opinion, perfectly fair.\\"Harry Trott, \\"Bowlers of New Zealand\\", Dominion, 8 February 1913, p. 6. First-class career Aged 35, Southall made his first-class debut on New Year's Day 1913 for Wellington against Auckland. He took 5 for 61 in the first innings, but Auckland won by nine wickets. In his first innings, batting in his customary position at number 11, he was bowled first ball by Caleb Olliff, who thus completed the innings with a hat- trick. He was unavailable for Wellington's early matches in the 1913-14 season,Evening Post, 18 December 1913, p. 4. but returned for the match against the Australians in February. Again he took five wickets in the first innings, dismissing Victor Trumper and Warwick Armstrong for ducks in successive balls and finishing with 5 for 34.Dominion, 16 February 1914, p. 6. The Australians were dismissed for 124 in reply to Wellington's 201, but went on to win the match. At the end of the season, in a first-class match between Wellington and a Canterbury team led by Dan Reese, he took 7 for 32 in the first innings, dismissing Reese's XI for 97. In club cricket in 1913-14 Southall took 42 wickets at 9.30 for Wellington North, who tied for the championship.Free Lance (Wellington), 11 April 1914, p. 19. He was unable to maintain his previous form in the three matches he played for Wellington in 1914-15, when he took six wickets at 46.83. In club cricket he took 42 wickets at 20.11, and Wellington North finished second.Free Lance, 16 April 1915, p. 20. Later career He served in the Otago Infantry Regiment in the First World War. He moved to Masterton in 1919, where he worked as Repatriation Officer for the Masterton Repatriation Board.Wairarapa Daily Times, 1 July 1919, p. 5. In his first match for the Carlton club in the Wairarapa Cricket Association he took 6 for 12 and 5 for 9.Auckland Star, 17 November 1919, p. 18. He took 2 for 20 and 4 for 26 for Wairarapa when they beat Poverty Bay to win the Hawke Cup in February 1921. He took six wickets when Wairarapa retained the Cup against Manawatu in early December 1921, and four wickets when they lost it to Rangitikei three weeks later. He became secretary of Masterton Racing Club in August 1922.Auckland Star, 7 August 1922, p. 7. In August 1923 he pleaded guilty to charges of forgery and theft arising from his period as a Repatriation Officer. The \\"total defalcations amounted to ¬£483\\", of which he had paid back more than half. He was \\"ordered to be detained for reformative purposes for twelve months\\".Evening Post, 4 August 1923, p. 9.

Types of deposit risk Deposit risk is a risk of probable cash outflows from a financial institution that is caused by changes in depositors‚Äô behavior. In its turn, it consists of early withdrawal or redemption risk, rollover risk and run risk. *Early withdrawal risk of time deposits is a risk that a depositor withdraws his or her deposit from an account before the agreed-upon maturity date. It might occur when the corresponding option was declared in a deposit agreement or determined by local laws. When an early withdrawal is made, the depositor usually incurs an early withdrawal fee or penalty.http://nbuv.gov.ua/j-pdf/Vnbu_2012_12_15.pdf *Rollover risk of time deposits is a risk that a depositor refuses to roll over his or her matured time deposit.http://riskarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/SSRN- id2205570.pdf *Run risk of non-maturity deposits is a risk that a depositor takes back money from his or her accounts at any time. Thus, a run risk has characters of both early withdrawal and rollover risks. For instance, it occurs when depositors expect a bank to fail. As a result, these risks might lead to dropping or even losing a liquidity of a financial institution if it cannot to attract new deposits instead of withdrawn ones. Wherein, the impossibility of the financial institution to refinance by borrowing in order to repay existing deposits is called a refinancing risk. Exposures to deposit risk *Exposure to early withdrawal risk at a given date is a sum of balances in time deposit accounts excluding those deposits that will be repaid at this date. *Exposure to rollover risk at a given date is a sum of cash flows from deposits that will be matured at this date. *Exposure to run risk at a given date is a sum of balances in non-maturity deposit accounts at this date. An early withdrawal risk affects a rollover risk through decrease of cash flows that will be repaid in the future. The early withdrawal and rollover risks depend on a term to maturity of deposits. The more maturity, the more early withdrawal risk, and the lower rollover risk, and vice versa. The main financial determinants of the early withdrawal and rollover risks are interest rates of the financial institution and its competitors, term to maturity and age of deposit, credit rating of the financial institution, and amount of deposit insurance. Evaluation of deposit risk The considered types of deposit risk are usually evaluated by ‚ÄòCash Flow at Risk‚Äô (also CFaR) approach. Thus, ‚ÄòCash Flow at Deposit Risk‚Äô is possible cash outflows from a financial institution over a fixed period of time that are predicted with chosen confidence level.http://www.ucema.edu.ar/u/jd/Metodos/Clases/CorporateMetricsTechDoc.pdfhttp://epub.lib.aalto.fi/fi/ethesis/pdf/12752/hse_ethesis_12752.pdf References Category:Financial risk ","title":"Deposit risk"},{"id":"45290531","text":"Dallas Heard (born 1985) is an American politician serving as a member of the Oregon Senate.

Barak Sultan was notable for having murdered his rival beheading the first Kazakh Khan in Kazakh history who took citizenship of Russia - Khan of Junior Juz Abulkhair Khan. It was revenge for Abulkhair Khan's pro-Russian policy and the last point was the alleged robbery of a caravan laden with gifts from Barak Sultan to the ruler of the Khanate of Khiva during attacks by Abulkhair Khan against the Karakalpaks, who were also under Barak Sultan's rule. One of his wives was a daughter of Galdan Tseren. During that marriage and until the death of Galdan Tseren in 1745 the war and conflicts between Kazakh Khanate and Dzhungaria had been stopped. As a descendant of Genghis Khan Barak wanted to become the ruler of two Turkic- Mongol states - Dzhungaria and Kazakh Khanate. Barak Sultan and his eldest son had been poisoned by a pro-Russian agent from Middle Juz in 1750. The death of Barak Sultan opened opportunities to expand Russian Empire over the Kazakh Steppe.

Originally established as Aviation Equipment Holding, it was given its current name in 2015. History Technodinamika, JSC (Aviation equipment holding) was created in 2009 to promote the development, production and export of hi-tech industrial products for civilian purposes. The Holding incorporates 36 enterprises of aviation industry located all over the Russian Federation . Nowadays, the company has a 51% share of the components market in the Russian aviation industry and manufactures more than 20000 products. The Holding's products are installed on almost every Russian passenger and cargo aircraft. In 2012 within the Holding was made a division for business development in the spheres of supply, repair and maintenance. Structure The essential stage in forming of the corporate structure of Technodinamika became the delivery of shareholdings of the key developers and manufacturers of aviation systems and components to the Holding. In December 2013, the Rostec in capacity of asset contribution delivered blocks of shares of 16 enterprises amounted to 8,4 billion rubles. Therefore, the state capital of the Holding increased in more than 8 times. In July 2014, the Holding received from the State Corporation shareholdings of other 10 enterprises- developers and manufacturers of aviation systems and assemblies for aircraft for civil. The total amount of the delivered shareholdings is about 3,4 billion roubles. Thus, Technodinamika gradually comes to the operational management of the Holding, with the opportunity to form the completed cooperative chain between the enterprises, to optimize expenses and increase the effectiveness of the introduction of products to the market. =Subsidiaries= Structure of the holding: * Ufa Research and Development Enterprise Molniya * UAPO * Gidravlika Ufa Aggregate Enterprise * Ufa Design and Project Institute of aviation industry * Leningrad Northern Plant * Aviaagregat * Gidroagregat * Respirator Research and Development Enterprise * Machine-Building Corporation MPO-Rumyantsev * NII Parachutostroeniya * Moscow Design and Production Complex Universal * Znamya Moscow Machine Building Plant * Mayak Machine Building plant * Textile Research Institute * Technodinamika Design center * Aviation Service Center * Electroprivod * Aviation Technology and Production Management Irkutsk Research Institute * Research and Development Enterprise Start * Kotlas Electromechanical Plant Russian partners Among the Holding's clients are such key Russian aircraft enterprises as Sukhoi, United Aircraft Corporation, Aircraft Corporation MIG, Ilyushin Aviation Complex, Tupolev Enterprise, Russian Helicopters Holding, Ministry of Defense, AVTOVAZ, airplane operators including Aeroflot, UTair etc. In October 2012, the chief executive of UAC Mikhail Pogosyan announced cooperation with Aviation Equipment Holding to produce a competence center for takeoff and landing unit's complexation. In 2013 within the MAKS Technodinamika and UAC-TA signed an agreement to supply of 39 equipment sets of on-board equipment and components worth 5 billion roubles. In July 2014 Technodinamika and UAC launched the development of an electric wheel drive for Sukhoi Superjet 100 (SSJ-100) Technodinamika cooperates with United Engine Corporation on creating equipment development for engine assembly and its modifications for Mi-28 helicopters as well as hospital aircraft Mi-17. Agreement is signed until the end of 2020. International cooperation By 2020 Technodinamika plans to adjust supply situation of serial products on international market of aviation components in 2017. In line with its development strategy, Technodinamika is gaining developer and integrator competencies in 12 different aviation system segments, including landing gear, aircraft power supply, safety, and life sustaining systems, powerplants, hydraulic and fuel systems. In 2013, Technodinamika (Aviation Equipment Holding) started integration into global aircraft branch by the partnership with global leaders in manufacturing assemblies and systems, by setting up several potential international projects. Thus, in July 2013, The Holding signed an agreement with Curtis-Wright Controls on producing fire protection systems (FPS) in Russia. November 27, 2015 Technodinamika says the test of the equipment, developed in co-operation with Curtiss-Wright Controls, has ‚Äúfully confirmed‚Äù its declared capabilities. The development was unveiled at the 2014 Farnborough Airshow and has no national prototypes. Fire protection system will beat all systems on national market. The system is 20% lighter and is more concise due to the construction of a new block and lightweight fire extinguishers. In addition, it is more reliable due to protection against false activation and may be installed on airplanes of different size and purpose, which reduces the unit cost and increases serial production. The system's modular design makes it possible to use the same components, therefore reducing production costs, while its service life will be at the same as that of the aircraft. In August 2014, within the MAKS Air Show, Aviation Equipment and the Boeing Corporation signed an agreement on creating a working group for evaluating capabilities of manufacturing landing gear components and control systems for the Boeing Corporation airplanes. The third party that signed an agreement was the UTS Aerospace Systems Corporation- Boeing's current landing gear integrator. Aviaagregat ‚Äì the Holding's enterprise in Samara plans to start a serial production of landing gear elements for the SSJ-100 in cooperation with the French company Messier‚ÄìBugatti-Dowty, the world leading aircraft landing gear manufacturer. In February 2014, Technodinamika launched to prepare to realize projects in production localization of Canadian Bombardier Q-400 and Austrian Diamond. On the occasion Farnborough International Air Show 2014 the Holding and French Company Microturbo (Safran) signed a Memorandum of Cooperation to create Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). In accordance with the contract terms both invest in development and industrialization of a new APU dedicated for helicopter market. Microturbo will design and develop main units and integrate the system. Aviation Equipment will develop the ignition system, electric starter, and electric generator and set up an assembly line of APU for the Russian aircraft. Another important branch of Technodinamika is extension in after sales service market. Thus, in 2012 the first Aircraft Service Center (ASC) was opened in Moscow and in 2013 was opened the Distribution Center of airplane spare parts at Sheremetyevo Airport. ASC was created in cooperation with Boeing Company for organization an effective distribution system of spare parts, components and assemblies for aircraft models of Russian and foreign production in Russia and CIS countries. In February 2014, Aircraft Service Center (ASC) and American company WENCOR opened the first consignment warehouse of components for aviation equipment at the center of distribution at Sheremetyevo Airport. Spare parts for Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 Classic and NG were included in the list. Production and perspective developments Company's products are installed in virtually all Russian‚Äìmade aircraft such as Tu-204/214, Il-114, An-148, Tu-154, Il-96, Yak-42 and transport aircraft as Il-76, An-124, Be-200, Tu-204S and helicopters Mi-8/17, Ka-32, Mi-26, Ka-226, Ansat, Mi-38, Ka-62. The Holding's systems and assemblies play an important role for military aviation. Many enterprises of the Holding are being the developers of the unique products that have no analogues both in Russia and in the world. For instance, Respirator Research and Development Enterprise is the developer of the Russia's first fully digitally controlled oxygen system for passenger planes. On the exhibition \\"MAKS 2015\\" Technodinamika shows electric wheel for aircraft. Wheel saves fuel, time for taxiing and reduces noise at the airport. Electric wheel is used to move the aircraft on the ground. Through the use of an electric wheel, there is no need to include in the taxiing jet engines, which means you can save about 200 liters of fuel, reduce noise and emissions into the atmosphere. Assembly Production Organization of Ufa (UAPO) developed an innovative system of DC power supply system SPTSu-7, 5 . The new power supply system with inverters with double energy conversion, which has twice as much power as former-generation system that were based on transformer converters. New system guarantees high resistance and stability of output voltage. Eventually, the system's modification is planned for installation in long-range aircraft MS-21 and later in all types of national airplanes and helicopters. The Scientific Research Institute of Parachute Construction has built the D-10P system for extreme meteorological conditions, which is essentially an upgraded version of the serially produced D10 parachute system for airborne forces. It utilizes forced parachute deployment, which means that parachute opens automatically after a jump. The new system makes it possible to jump from as low as 50m, not 200m like before. In July 2016 Tecnodinamika unveiled a new kind of parachute, especially designed for space landings. It was presented at the Innoprom International Industrial Trade Fair in Ekaterinburg Zvezda Research and Development Enterprise has built the world's first helicopter emergency evacuation system, which is installed in Ka-52 ‚ÄúAlligator‚Äù and guarantees the rescue of the staff at all flying modes. The same enterprise has developed the Orlan-MKS next-generation space suit for space-walks. The suit is computerized, with a new control panel display and an improved date processing system. At MAKS 2013 Airshow enterprise demonstrated mail landing gear for perspective Ka-62 helicopter the uniqueness of its construction is combination of shock absorption and retractor in one assembly. Thus combined shock absorption retractor is small- sized and allows reducing of technical costs. In 2013, the Technodinamika developed a series of full-scale and electronic mockups of aircraft systems for civil airplanes and helicopters which will enter mass production in Russia till 2025. Developments were made for MS-21, SSJ-100 airplanes and civil helicopters. As the result were signed two contracts with the Ministry of Industry and Trade of creating mass production of eight aviation systems to replace foreign prototypes in terms of state program ‚ÄúThe development of aircraft industry during 2013‚Äì2025 years‚Äù The total amount of investment from the state budget and personal Holding's facilities will be more than 1,4 billion roubles. In addition, in terms of import substitution industrialization program FTP ‚ÄòDevelopment of Civil Aircraft Equipment‚Äù, the Holding plans to create anti-abnormal fuel system and basic block of electrical generating system ‚ÄìDC generator. In January 2014, Technodinamika proceeded to develop fuel system for promising Russian helicopters that is able to prevent fire burnt of aircraft. Fire safety is assured by keeping pressure-sealing of fuel system during crash landing and by using module for fuel tanks inflation with inerting agent. At Farnborough-2014 one of the Holding's innovations was an innovative model APU-120 with the direct acting for MS-21 airplanes and Il-96MD-90A. APU is developing in accordance with ‚Äúmore electric aircraft‚Äù concept. APU-120 is more powerful than all Russian equivalents and the no gearbox solution decreases the number of parts in the APU-120 by 30% which in turn lowers the cost. By 2015, Technodinamika will create the first Russian prototype of an innovative electric landing gear wheel drive for SSJ-100 jet and will hold its bench running. The role of the projects integrator will be given to one of the Holding's enterprises Aviaagregat,- one of the main Russian developers and supplies of landing gear for civil, transport and military aircraft. For this project, the Samara-based Aviaagregat set up an extensive network of cooperation with industry leaders. In November 2015 Russian Technodinamika has carried out initial tests of the fire-protection system for the Irkut MC-21. Technodinamika says the test of the equipment, developed in co-operation with Curtiss-Wright Controls, has ‚Äúfully confirmed‚Äù its declared capabilities. In March 2016 Technodinamika claims that its development for the Aviadvigatel PD-14 engine is the first of its kind in the country, and will replace the usual hydraulically-driven systems. Technodinamika (Russia)- is one of the key players operating in the commercial aircraft oxygen systems market Finances The overall revenue of Technodinamika increased by more than 43% compared to the previous year and exceeded 20 billion roubles, the overall net profit rose by 81% (1 billion roubles). Also, in 2013, an investment program of the Holding was developed by the end of 2016, under which the scope of financial support to technical re- equip the enterprises would be more than 9,5 roubles. In particular, production modernization has been started at NPP Start, Aviaagregat, MPO named after Rumyantsev, UAP Hydraulics, MMZ Znamya and MKPK Universal. Development strategy The Holding's strategy expects to exceed revenue from 20 bln roubles in 2013 to 65 bln roubles in 2020 and exceed overall net profit from1 bln roubles in 2013 to 9,3 bln roubles by 2020. Considerably, about 7% of revenue will be allocated by R&D; which means that annual expenses will be about 4,5 billion roubles by 2020. Overall volume investment of the Holding will be more than 70 billion roubles, 30 billion of which will be spent on R&D-and; the same sum will be used to create system of aftersales service of Russian and foreign aircraft, 1, 5 billion roubles will be spent on realization IT technologies. These funds are planned to be raised by operating income, and federal target programs ‚ÄúDevelopment of the Russian Civil Aviation‚Äù and ‚ÄúDevelopment of Defense Industry‚Äù, credits and other resources. So far, Aviation Equipment Holding develop an integrator competence in nine aviation systems: power supply, landing gear, auxiliary power unit, hydraulic and fuel systems, oxygen system, fire protection system parachutes and airlift delivery, emergency escape and ground support equipment. To expand and develop the presence in international market, Aviation Equipment is planning to add to the list hydraulic and fuel system. The Holding's presence as a second-level supplier will be kept in air conditioning system, saving equipment and flight controller. Important targets of the Holding to increase competitiveness of the Holding's products and integration into global aircraft industry is implementation of international quality standards EASA and enterprise's certification according to the world requirements for companies-manufacturers of aviation equipment. Now Days, Aviaagregat plant in Samara confirmed that its quality management system complies with AS/EN 9100:2009 for aviation, space and defense enterprises. Ufa Research and Development Enterprise Molniya which is a part of Aviation Equipment Holding successfully completed certification audit quality management system ISO 9001 and AS/EN 910 for development, manufacture and test runs of aviation equipment. The sphere of standard certification includes development, manufacture and test runs of aviation equipment including igniting systems, subsystems of electronic management, safety and diagnostics of airplane's and helicopter's aero engines. Other enterprises within the Technodinamika, Hydraulics in particular, are preparing to confirm certification by international standards. Formation of competence centres has become an important step in efficiency upgrading. They allow uniting enterprises on the base of several single places by engineering and manufacturing capacity characteristics. –ê–û –¢–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏–∫–∞ plans to create competence centres in casting, instrumental and mechanic spheres. Nowadays, the pilot projects of technological clusters are successfully launched on the base of Ufa Assembly Production Association (UAPO) and Aviaagregat plant in Samara. In the future, Ufa Competence Centre will fully provide all Holding's enterprises with casting blanks and Samara Mechanical Treatment and Engineering Centre will establish an effective technological preparation of production and manufacturing of hydraulic cylinders and other products of mechanical production. In June 2014, for the first time in Russia Technodinamika opened an engineering design center for civil and military aircraft that will unite all the regional design bureaus in one system. Thus, the whole products for airplanes from landing gears to APU will be presented to the buyer. The new aircraft system development time shall be increased by 30% and development cost shall be decreased by 1,5 times. The design center headquarters is located in Moscow with branches in St. Petersburg (and later in Ufa and Samara on the base of design bureaus of holding enterprises). At the initial stage about 400 design-engineers will work in the center of competences. Social policy In 2013, on the base of MIPT Aviation Equipment created the first in Russia educational program to prepare design engineers in the sphere of ‚ÄúHigh Technology Innovation Economics‚Äù Master's degree program is oriented on budding young engineers with experience about 3‚Äì7 years, whose gained knowledge will help to reach the new level of competitive products. In terms of this program, a course of master classes was made with the participation of leading experts of the branch and executives of international companies. Among these experts are: professor of aeronautics and astronautics and engineering systems at MIT, president of the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) Edward Crawley, chair of the Venezuelan Node of the Millennium Project, research fellow at the Institute of Developing Economies in Tokyo and energy adviser at Singularity University (USA) Jos√© Luis Cordeiro and the author of non-verbal coaching method ‚Äú5 rings system.‚Äù Stuart Heller.

The company‚Äôs core competencies are based on the development of components and systems for the generation of vacuum and gas management engineering. History In 1850, the merchant Martin Kothe founded the trading company Kothe, but died a year later. With the introduction of the manager Ernst Leybold in 1851, the company Leybold & Kothe was formed, focusing on the distribution of pharmaceutical and physical-technical equipment and apparatus. In 1863, Ernst Leybold took over the company completely, but resold it in 1870. The company name lived on for some time, however, as E. Leybold‚Äôs Nachfolger (E. Leybold‚Äôs Successor). The company divested the pharmaceutical sector to focus on propaedeutic and teaching materials, initiating the serial production of vacuum pumps as of 1906.

Leybold‚Äôs Nachfolger with Heraeus Hochvakuum GmbH. The Degussa AG, the Metallgesellschaft AG and the W.C. Heraeus GmbH were equal shareholders in the newly created Leybold Heraeus GmbH. After Metallgesellschaft and W.C. Heraeus sold their shares in 1987, Leybold Heraeus GmbH became Leybold AG and its headquarters were moved from Cologne to Hanau. In 1994, Degussa sold Leybold to the Swiss Oerlikon B√ºhrle Group, which combined Leybold with the Balzers AG, which was already in their possession, to form the Balzers and Leybold Group. The merger of these companies resulted in the world‚Äôs largest vacuum and surface technology company with around 6 500 employees, generating sales of DEM 1.8 billion in 1995. In 2000, Degussa sold the remaining propaedeutic and teaching materials division, which today ‚Äì after bankruptcy in 2008 ‚Äì operates under the company name LD Didactic and has its headquarters near Cologne. In 2006, Leybold Vacuum GmbH was renamed to Oerlikon Leybold Vacuum as part of a group-wide renaming of all Group Segments. In 2015 Oerlikon announced the sale of the vacuum business to Swedish company Atlas Copco. The sale was finalized in September 2016. Then, the company was renamed to Leybold GmbH and became part of the Vacuum Solutions division of the Compressors business area of Atlas Copco.Press Release: Atlas Copco completes Leybold vacuum acquisition References  External links  * Leybold GmbH * German  Literature  * Vakuum Pumpen (Gastransfervakuumpumpen), W.

Life Pinto's father, Guglielmo Pinto, left a high- ranking position in Naples for political reasons, and settled in England; he married, and he and his wife Mary had three sons, of whom Thomas was baptised in London on 2 February 1728. As a child Thomas Pinto played the violin well, and aged 11 he could play the concertos of Arcangelo Corelli; he was leading important concerts before he was twenty. He was able to play music at sight so well that he neglected practicing. He became more ambitious when impressed by the success of Felice Giardini, an Italian violinist who came to England in 1750 and led the orchestra of Italian opera in London. Pinto became leader when Giardini was unavailable. He was for a period leader of the orchestra of the Drury Lane theatre and at Vauxhall Gardens.Pinto (Thomas) A Dictionary of Musicians (1825).Pinto, Thomas An Encyclopedia of the Violin by Alberto Bachmann, Courier Corporation 2013 (first published 1925). In 1769 he became joint owner, with a Mr Troughton, of Marylebone Gardens, and he led the orchestra there. Because of a wet summer, the business venture failed, and Pinto moved to Scotland; in 1773 he moved to Dublin where he led the orchestra of the Smock Alley Theatre. He died in Edinburgh in 1783. Family In 1745 he married Sybilla Gronemann, a German singer; they had several children including Julia, the mother of the composer and pianist George Pinto. After his first wife's death Pinto married in 1766 the singer Charlotte Brent, and they had seven children.

Symptoms generally include a rash of the forehead with swelling of the eyelid. There may also be eye pain, eye redness, and light sensitivity. Before the rash appears tingling may occur in the forehead along with a fever. Complications may include vision loss, increased pressure within the eye, and chronic pain. The underlying mechanism involves a reactivation of the varicella zoster virus within the ophthalmic nerve (the first division of the trigeminal nerve). Risk factors include poor immune function, psychological stress, and older age. Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms. Treatment is generally with antiviral pills such as acyclovir. Steroid eye- drops and drops to dilate the pupil may also be used. The herpes zoster vaccine is recommended for prevention in those over the age of 50. Shingles affects up to half a million people in the United States a year of which 10% to 25% involve the eye. Signs and symptoms =Skin= Trigeminal shingles with uveitis and keratitis * Viral prodrome * Preherpetic neuralgia * Rash, transitioning from papules to vesicles to pustules to scabs. The frontal nerve is more commonly affected than the nasociliary nerve or lacrimal nerve. * Hutchinson's sign: cutaneous involvement of the tip of the nose, indicating nasociliary nerve involvement. A positive Hutchinson's sign increases the likelihood of ocular complications associated with HZO. * Disseminated distribution in individuals with immunodeficiency. =Cornea= Herpes zoster ophthalmicus as seen after florescence staining using cobalt blue light * Epithelial: punctate epithelial erosions and pseudodendrites: often have anterior stromal infiltrates. Onset 2 to 3 days after the onset of the rash, resolving within 2‚Äì3 weeks. Common. * Stromal: ** Nummular keratitis: have anterior stromal granular deposits. Occurs within 10 days of onset of rash. Uncommon ** Necrotising interstitial keratitis: Characterised by stromal infiltrates, corneal thinning and possibly perforation. Occurs between 3 months and several years after onset of rash. Rare. * Disciform Keratitis (Disciform Endotheliitis): a disc of corneal oedema, folds in Descemet's membrane, mild inflammation evident within the anterior chamber and fine keratic precipitates. Chronic. Occurs between 3 months and several years after the onset of the rash. Uncommon. * Neurotrophic: corneal nerve damage causes persistent epithelial defect, thinning and even perforation. Cornea becomes susceptible to bacterial and fungal keratitis. Chronic. Late onset. Uncommon. * Mucous plaques: linear grey elevations loosely adherent to the underlying diseased epithelium/stroma. Chronic. Onset between 3 months and several years after the onset of the rash. =Uveal= Anterior uveitis develops in 40‚Äì50% of cases with HZO within 2 weeks of onset of the skin rashes. Typical HZO keratitis at least mild iritis, especially if Hutchinson's sign is positive for the presence of vesicles upon the tip of the nose. Features: This non- granulomatous iridocyclitis is associated with: * Small keratic precipitates * Mild aqueous flare * Occasionally haemorrhagic hypopyon HZO uveitis is associated with complications such as iris atrophy and secondary glaucoma are not uncommon. Complicated cataract may develop in the late stages of the disease. Treatment Treatment is usually with antivirals such as acyclovir or valacyclovir by mouth. There is uncertainty as to the difference in effect between these two antivirals. Antiviral eye drops have not been found to be useful. These medications work best if started within 3 days of the start of the rash. Cycloplegics prevent synechiae from forming.

The Lunar Mission One program closed down due to tax issues. Overview The mission, which is in its early conceptual stages, aims to send a lunar lander to the Moon in 2024. The lander would drill below the surface of the Lunar South Pole to a depth of up to 100m, in the hope of accessing lunar rock up to 4.5 billion years old. The lunar lander would contain scientific instruments to explore the science and geology behind the origins of the Moon and the Solar System. After drilling, the module would place a time capsule into the borehole. This time capsule would contain a public archive, with a record of Earth's biosphere and a history of human civilization, and a private archive consisting of millions of digital memory boxes. Consumers would be able to purchase digital memory boxes, and fill them with digital data such as photos or videos. They would also be able to store their DNA via a strand of hair. Lunar Missions Limited has set the total cost of the mission at ¬£500 million and it is aiming to raise these funds through global sales of digital memory boxes. Funding for the initial legal fees was raised on the international crowd-funding platform, Kickstarter. The fundraising was successfully completed on 17 December 2014, with ¬£672,447 ($1,017,000 approx.) being pledged, exceeding the minimum target of ¬£600,000 ($900,000 approx.).

The Chola emperor Raja Raja, who was the builder of the great temple of Tanjore, came here to pray to Shiva as Kumara Natha or Nilakantheshvara for a son. His prayer was answered and a son whom he named Rajendra was born. It was this Rajendra who build a replica of his father's temple in Gangaikondacholapuram, some 30 kilometer south of Rajendrapattinam. Rajaraja Chola ruled from 985 to 1014. His son Rajendra Chola ruled between 1012 and 1044. Both were successful kings who brought peace and prosperity to their people. But this temple existed long before Rajaraja was king of all of southern India. Long before his son Rajendra brought the water of the sacred river Ganga from northern India to the land of the Tamils. This is the meaning of Gangaikondacholapuram, \\"the city of the Chola who brought the sacred water of Ganga\\". Then the place was called Thiru Erukkattam Puliyur, and it was one among five sacred places connected to the saint Vyagrapada, who is better known for his important role in the establishment of the Shiva Nataraja temple in Chidambaram, which is some 40 kilometer to the East from here. It features in the list of temples that have songs dedicated to them in the body of hymns called Thevaram, which were composed in the 6th to 7th century, and it was very ancient and sacred even then. The sthala purana or temple myth tells of how once Parvati, the consort of Lord Shiva, did not pay proper attention when her husband was explaining the Agama or doctrine. She became distracted and Shiva became angry and cursed her. Because of the curse she was born on Earth as the daughter of a fishermen family. Her two sons, Ganesha (the god who is the destroyer of obstacles and has the face of an elephant) and Subrahmanya (the young war god who rides the peacock) thereupon threw away the Agama. His father, Shiva, cursed him to become a dumb boy. He searched for relief of the curse and finally came to Erukkattam Puliyur. Here he prayed and worshiped Siva, and performed penance. He also thrashed his vel or spear into the ground and created the sacred pond in front of the temple, now called Nilurpala thirtham. Shiva was now pleased with his penance and released him from the curse. That is why Shiva here is called Thirukumara Nathar. Thiru (Shri, the shining one), Kumara (the young boy, Subrahmaya or Murugan), Natha (Lord, who is worshipped by). The sthala vriksham or sacred tree of this temple is the velerukku tree. The main shrine for Shiva and the shrine for the goddess have T podikai and the outer walls of the garbhagriha each has a panjara instead of a niche. The T podikai suggests a construction date belonging to the time of Rajaraja Chola, till around the time of the ascention of Kulottung I. The Panjaras are of the II b type (G.Hoekveld-Meijer, Koyils in the Colamandalam, 1981, p. 115). They do not have a base of their own, and the shala which forms the top is not part of the kapota. It is very well possible this shrine may have been built by Rajaraja or his son, Rajendra. The murtis in the panjara do not seem to belong to these panjara, or to the Chola period. They look very archaic and are much smaller than the panjaras. They may have been preserved from the earlier temple structure when this temple was rebuilt under the Cholas.

It was founded by three members of Gaza following the band's break-up. Cult Leader signed to Jacob Bannon's record label Deathwish Inc. and have released two studio albums, Lightless Walk (2015) and A Patient Man (2018), as well two EPs through the label, showcasing a brutal sound with prominent elements of extreme metal. History In late 2012, an unnamed woman from Idaho began posting on her social media accounts alleging that a member of the Salt Lake City band Gaza had raped her, and later identified the Gaza member as its vocalist, Jon Parkin. In January 2013, Gaza posted a status update on their Facebook account denying that the rape allegations were true, calling the claims \\"reckless and completely slanderous,\\" and the matter was settled privately between the two parties. An excerpt from the woman's blog following the resolution read: \\"Neither of us are retracting our respective statements ‚Äì instead we are deciding to not discuss it further and move on.\\" Despite the resolution, Gaza formally announced its break up in March 2013, and their announcement also stated: \\"some of us will continue to make music together.\\" In addition to the rape allegations, the other members of Gaza also cited tension between them and Parkin that had been building up over the course of two years. Gaza bassist Anthony Lucero said: > It started to become really frustrating and tours were getting cancelled and > all kinds of stuff was happening, so when that stupid, horrible shit blew up > on the Internet, then it had reached the point where the three of us said > that we'd had enough of this, it's done, and so we decided to actually kick > Jon [Parkin] out of the band. Then we sat with Gaza for awhile, trying to > figure out what we were going to do, and eventually it felt like the only > right thing to do was just start from scratch. In May 2013, two months after the break-up announcement, former Gaza members guitarist Mike Mason, drummer Casey Hansen and Anthony Lucero ‚Äì who was Gaza's bassist, but switched to lead vocals for this project ‚Äì announced they formed a new band called Cult Leader, and recruited Sam Richards on bass. They decided on the name Cult Leader because it conjured up vivid imagery, and Lucero commented: \\"A friend of ours actually suggested that and my brain lit up. I loved all the references and all the meanings.\\" Cult Leader released its debut EP Nothing for Us Here on April 15, 2014 through Deathwish Inc. The release \\"came together\\" in about a week, and the band was considering self- releasing the album for a while. They sent a copy to their friend Jacob Bannon of Converge to see what he thought of the music, who in turn suggested that Cult Leader release the EP through his own label, Deathwish. The title of EP was, in part, a reference to Gaza's break up. Nothing for Us Here was met with generally favorable reviews upon release, and Cult Leader toured the US in April‚ÄìMay 2014 in support of it. In November 2014, Cult Leader announced their plans to release a 7\\" EP and a full-length studio album in 2015. The 7\\" is a three-song EP titled Useless Animal that will be released on June 16, 2015 through Deathwish. The EP notably featured a cover of Mark Kozelek (Red House Painters, Sun Kil Moon) and Deathshore's collaboration track \\"You Are Not My Blood,\\" which originally appeared on their 2013 album Mark Kozelek & Desertshore. Before the release of the EP, Cult Leader toured across the US as they traveled from Utah to producer and Converge member Kurt Ballou's GodCity Studio in Massachusetts to record their first full-length album in March 2015, and continued to tour North America through May 2015 immediately after recording was finished. The full-length album, titled Lightless Walk, was released on October 16, 2015 through Deathwish followed by an October‚ÄìNovember 2015 supporting North American tour. On November 9, 2018, Cult Leader released its second studio album A Patient Man through Deathwish. The band began promoting the Ballou-produced album with an online stream of \\"I Am Healed\\" in September 2018.

He later appears as the main protagonist in the 2015 anime film Boruto: Naruto the Movie where he is training as a ninja to surpass his father, the leader of the ninja village Konohagakure and also being mentored by his father's best friend, Sasuke Uchiha. Boruto also serves as a protagonist in the manga and anime series Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. In the manga, it starts off with the retelling of the Boruto film, while the anime begins with his childhood in the ninja academy where he meets his future teammates‚ÄîSarada Uchiha and Mitsuki‚Äîas well as his teacher, Konohamaru Sarutobi. Despite Boruto's physical designs being similar to Naruto when he was young, their personalities are developed differently. Boruto's relationship with his father reflects Kishimoto's relationship with his children. In the Japanese version, Boruto is voiced by Kokoro Kikuchi in The Last: Naruto the Movie and by Y≈´ko Sanpei in all subsequent appearances. Sanpei enjoyed doing the work of Boruto's acting, finding him endearing. In the English version, he is voiced by Amanda C. Miller. Boruto's character has received mixed critical responses. His relationship with his father has been criticized due to reviewers finding the concept overused in the Naruto manga. In Boruto: Naruto the Movie, his development was praised due to his action scenes and how he understood his father's actions. Creation and conception Masashi Kishimoto created Boruto in 2013 when the manga Naruto was at its climax. The motivation for the creation was him wanting Naruto Uzumaki to become a father when the manga ends. In the finale of Naruto, Boruto makes a prank in the mountain of Konoha that shows all its leaders, the Hokages. Kishimoto wanted Boruto to act like his father, but at the same time, have differences between each other. Despite not wishing to reveal much about Boruto due to developments of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, he added that Boruto is not as direct as Naruto. Boruto's first name is a reference to his first cousin once removed Neji Hyuga as an homage to his death in Naruto while protecting both of Boruto's parents. In Boruto: Naruto the Movie, Kishimoto developed Boruto and Naruto's relationship from his relationship with his sons. He wanted the film to depict the father and son relationship between Boruto and Naruto. The film's theme song, by Kana-Boon, serves as a reference to Boruto. One of the singers of the band stated that it reflects how the character constantly changes from the beginning to the end of the story. Boruto's mentorship by Naruto's rival and best friend Sasuke Uchiha was influenced due to the latter having few appearances in the Naruto movies. Kishimoto decided that he wanted Sasuke to have a major role in Boruto: Naruto the Movie, which he wrote. In the film, Sasuke becomes the teacher of Naruto's first son, Boruto, inspired by Piccolo from the Dragon Ball manga series by Akira Toriyama. A former enemy of Dragon Ball protagonist Goku, Piccolo becomes the teacher of Goku's first son, Gohan. studio: Pierrot. Boruto anime and film director Hiroyuki Yamashita said that when first seeing the character in Sarada Uchiha's spin-off, he liked his character. In the making of the Boruto film, Yamashita said some scenes regarding to Boruto were removed due to time constraints such as one of the character's interactions with his father as well as another interaction between Boruto and Sarada. A difficult scene for the staff was the use of Boruto's technique which had to disappear shortly after being used and then appearing again in an attack. The scene in which Naruto passes his son all of his chakra to increase his Rasengan was carefully storyboarded in the film. Although Boruto is the protagonist of Next Generations series, Ikemoto stated in early 2019 that the relationship between Boruto and Kawaki will be the most important point in the story as the manga is aimed to reach the flashforward scene from the first chapter where both characters start fighting against each other. =Design= Boruto's teenage appearance was made in a rush. As a result, Mikio Ikemoto believes that once the series reaches this moment, the design will change drastically. In designing the character, Kishimoto intended Boruto to be similar to his father but at the same time avoided facial similarities in the eyes and cheeks due to the fact Naruto had the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox, Kurama, sealed inside him unlike his son. Additionally, he gave him a simpler costume than Naruto's original one that would yet remain the symbol of the Uzumaki clan. The author purposefully let Boruto wear his clothes casually by making him wear his jacket unzipped since he found it suitable for the character's personality. For the finale of the manga, Kishimoto originally intended to give Boruto the Byakugan, an eye technique which he would inherit from his mother Hinata Hyuga. However, the author forgot about it and instead gave him an unknown eye technique (it allows him to see chakra, an energy source within ninjas to perform jutsu) which is often shown on Boruto's right eye. During July 2017, one of the animators from Boruto: Naruto Next Generations revealed Boruto's eye is called and that its powers are related to the Byakugan and Naruto's ability to sense negative emotions. However, the animator refrained from explaining more about since the J≈çgan would be explained later in the series. In the first few pages of the first chapter Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, an encounter between an older teenage Boruto against another one named Kawaki was briefly shown as a flashforward. The purpose was to attract more fans so they could look forward to the battle as it has a chaotic state to it. The battle against Kawaki was shown instead in the first chapter rather than Sasuke's one against Kinshiki Otsutsuki from the Boruto film to generate a different impact within the fans despite sharing the same storyline. Boruto's teenage design was first illustrated in little time. As a result, Mikio Ikemoto stated that once Boruto reached this moment, the older protagonist's design might change. As the story in the manga progresses, Boruto's facial expressions change when interacting with other character; with the friendly Tento, Boruto's eyes are shown bigger due to the portrayal of Boruto's childish personality. However, upon meeting Kawaki, Boruto's eyes are illustrated smaller due to the author's intent to show a more rebellious take on Boruto. Due to the staff of the Naruto anime referring to Naruto and Sasuke as \\"legendary characters\\", anime developers Pierrot aim to carefully portray Boruto and his friends, the \\"new generation\\", as the new protagonists. They also seek to have them developed as the previous generation. However, Kishimoto is concerned about how Boruto and his friends could reach Naruto and Sasuke's strength as he finds it repetitive. Ikemoto stated that Boruto's look is predetermined by the storyline so the author instead could not draw the character on his own completely. However, the scene from the 9th chapter where Boruto creates a Rasengan with his father left a big impression on him, believing it was important for the storyline. =Voice actors= In the Japanese version, he was voiced by Kokoro Kikuchi in The Last as a toddler; for the Boruto film and anime, he is voiced by Y≈´ko Sanpei. Sanpei has been a fan of the Naruto manga series ever since she was young. While identifying herself with Naruto Uzumaki's character, the actress noted the bond between her and Naruto became stronger when learning she would voice her son. As a result, once learning she got the role for Boruto's character, Sanpei bought the entire Naruto manga series despite already having it to prepare for the Boruto film. Sanpei was thankful for being offered this position and joked about how Junko Takeuchi became a \\"father\\" as her voice role was Naruto. Initially, Sanpei recalls having difficulties voicing Boruto; when she received her script for the film, she began to understand Boruto's concept as the boy who loves his father dearly, which helped her voice the character better. Please with the film Boruto, Sanpei asked Kishimoto to make another one which resulted in Kishimoto asking her to let him rest for another one. In the English version, he was voiced by Maile Flanagan in The Last: Naruto the Movie film as a toddler and Amanda C. Miller in the Boruto film as a teenager. Boruto is the first main character Miller has ever voiced. While enjoying the work she does as Boruto's English voice, she stated she felt stress about it due to how important her character is considering his role in the story. Miller and the other Boruto English voice actors felt honored to play the characters based on how large the franchise is. Flanagan and Miller found the two family members similar in nature despite having different backgrounds. Appearances First appearing in Narutos finale, Boruto is a child who attends Konoha's ninja academy, inheriting his paternal father's verbal tic. and often takes care of his sister, Himawari Uzumaki. Like Naruto, Boruto commits mischief to get attention, but for different reasons. Due to his father becoming the Hokage (the leader of Konoha), he does not spend any time with him as he used to. He makes a brief appearance in Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring, where he gives a meal to his comrade Sarada Uchiha to pass on to his father; she becomes motivated to become the Hokage after the day she had. While the movie and manga open to Boruto after his graduation from the Ninja Academy, the anime adaptation shows him when still attended the school. Boruto's Hyuga lineage allowed him to manifest an \\"Eye Technique\\" that allows him to fully use his Gentle Fist fighting style while also seeing people's contaminated chakra. This enables him to solve the mystery of a \\"Ghost\\" corrupting fellow villagers alongside his friends and older ninjas to find the culprit. Boruto and his friends take a trip to the village of Kirigakure, befriending the young ninja Kagura Karatachi while stopping a coup by those wanting to revive their village's horrific Blood Mist traditions. Boruto later graduates and forms the new \\"Team 7\\" alongside Sarada and Mitsuki under the leadership of Konohamaru Sarutobi. Together they start performing multiple ninja missions. He is also present in two original video animations where he indirected caused his father to be knocked out after accidentally breaking Himawari's doll and another one where Team Konohamaru is sent to stop an apparent thief. In the 2015 film Boruto: Naruto the Movie, and its retellings, Boruto joins the Chunin examinations while gradually becoming frustrated by Naruto putting the village ahead of their family. Boruto ends up meeting his father's best friend and rival, Sarada's father Sasuke Uchiha, and managed to become his apprentice after learning to use the Rasengan while accidentally creating new variation of it. But when the exams commence, Boruto cheats causing his disqualification. As this happens, Naruto is captured by Momoshiki Otsutsuki while protecting their village from the alien's attack. Boruto realizes the error of his ways and joins Sasuke and the Kage to save Naruto. With the help of Naruto and Sasuke, Boruto defeats the enemy Momoshiki with his Rasengan. Although he resented the Hokage position, Boruto becomes resolute to become strong to protect his village's leader in the same way as Sasuke and entrusts Sarada to be a future Hokage instead of himself. Boruto also reprises his role in the novel adaptation of the movie, as well as part of an omake from the manga Sasuke Uchiha's Sharingan Legend where he trains with the title character. But as revealed in the manga Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Boruto was branded by a dying Momoshiki with a \\"seal\\" in his right hand known as . In the manga, after the Momoshiki fight, Boruto becomes a bodyguard to the Fire Feudal Lord's son Tent≈ç Madoka, befriending the boy while teaching him ninjutsu. Boruto later learns the existence of a group of ninja known as the Kara while he and his team meet a former Kara member named Kawaki, who becomes his enemy as revealed in the series opening scene where the two are older and Boruto can consciously control his \\"Eye Technique\\". As Boruto befriends Kawaki, the two learn of Kara who wish to take them as both possess the Karma. During a fight against a criminal named Boro, Boruto's Karma causes him to be possessed by Momoshiki who is seaking to take over his body through the Karma. Outside manga and anime, Boruto also appears in the fighting game Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, first only in the ending and playable in the expansion pack Road to Boruto. Following Momoshiki's defeat, Boruto can fight against Naruto. Although Boruto loses, his father states he is proud of how much he developed his skills, pleasing Boruto. In 2019, CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama received multiple requests by fans to develop another Storm game but claimed that this was meant to be the final game in the series. Nevertheless, he claims Bandai Visual is up to decide if the developers should develop a new series of games focused on Boruto. He appears in the video game Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker as a playable character, as well as Naruto x Boruto: Ninja Voltage. He is also featured in the Boruto light novels. Reception Critical reception to Boruto's character has been generally mixed. Upon first seeing him Ramsey Isler from IGN found him too similar to his father. On the other hand, Andy Hanley from UK Anime Network said despite his similar design and actions to his father Naruto, Boruto is not like him and has a different personality. Amy McNulty from Anime News Network and Hanley enjoyed Boruto's relationship with his father Naruto due to the differences in their childhoods and how that becomes the focus of the film Boruto: Naruto the Movie. McNulty also liked how Boruto develops as he became afraid of his father's fate during an attack from the antagonist. She praised Amanda C. Miller's role as Boruto's English actor, but feeling the voice often sounded more feminine than his Japanese counterpart. Christian Chiok from Japanator enjoyed Boruto's character development, his relationship with his father, and how heartwarming it becomes in the movie. Alexandria Hill from Otaku USA enjoyed Boruto's fight against the film's villain and his team-up with Naruto and Sasuke. Chris Zimmerman from DVD Talk noted how the writers fairly conceived Boruto's poor relationship with his father and how it improves during the climax of the film. Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network praised how the writers manage to develop Boruto's angst without coming across as \\"teen whining\\" and how Sasuke Uchiha decides to train him upon seeing his similarities with his father. Leroy Douresseaux liked how Boruto's character has already started development by the second volume of the series. The misrelationship Boruto forms Kawaki's was seen as a striking rivalry similar to the one his father had with Sasuke in the first series. McNulty expressed joy in how the viewer of the Boruto anime gets to see Boruto's days in the ninja academy which Naruto briefly showed and how Boruto does not have the same behavior as his father when being a child. While noting that Boruto has still to fight enemies possessed by \\"shadows\\" in the anime, Anime Now writer Sarah Nelkin found this more lighthearted than Naruto's actions in the first series such as his final fight against Sasuke Uchiha where both became friends after nearly killing each other. Upon the build up of the anime's first story arc, McNulty praised the fight between Boruto, Mitsuki and Sumire was praised for its animation with the reviewer also noting how Boruto inherited his father's ways of seeing on the good parts of his enemies in order to avoid violence. Viz Media senior director Kevin Hamric referred to Boruto described his differences with his father such as his lack of desire to become the village's leader and instead do other activities like playing video games. However, Hamric said he initially has the desire to surpass his father. Denki Kaminarimon's voice actress, Chihiro Ikki, said she liked how Boruto protects Denki from bullies in the series' beginning having once being bullied when she was younger. In regards to the flashforward with the destroyed village, Ikki said she had no idea what was going on but expects Denki will be in that future to aid the older Boruto to protect the ninja world from the antagonist threatening it. While Boruto‚Äôs character development was met with praise, other critics felt otherwise. Richard Eisenbeis from Kotaku was critical to Boruto's development, as he felt that his bond with his father at the end of the Boruto film was unthinkable and weak. Thais Valdivia from Hobby Consolas stated that while viewers of the film may initially dislike Boruto's personality, his character arc helps to make him more appealing adding his fight alongside Naruto and Sasuke as one of the highlights. Chris Beveridge from the Fandom Post disliked the large focus between Naruto and Boruto's relationship on the first chapter of the Boruto manga. Nevertheless, he enjoyed the foreshadow of an older Boruto on a fight against an unknown character. For the anime, Beveridge remarked Boruto's characterization which he felt was superior to the one from the manga. Sam Stewart from IGN felt Boruto's personality was \\"far less enthused\\" as the reviewer commented he found the character's dislike toward his father misguided and finding types of stories too common in fiction. In a review from the manga, Nick Smith from ICv2 found Boruto as the weak part of the series due to his personality that contrasted the Naruto in the original Naruto series. He also said \\"The politicking within the power structure surrounding Naruto and Boruto becomes more interesting than Boruto himself\\" and as a result expected Boruto to change in upcoming chapters to make the series more appealing. However, Melina Dargis liked how Boruto realizes his father's goals and joined Sasuke and the Kages in order to save Naruto. Additionally, Dargis noted Boruto's early strained relationship with his father as well as his use of technology to fight might reflect on modern audiences who might understand his character more as a result. As the character developed, Stewart enjoyed Boruto due to his childish personality as he starts acting like a hero from an action film he just watched worrying his family in the process. Additionally, the reviewer liked how Boruto's mysterious \\"Eye Technique\\" started making references to a previous Naruto film. While comparing Boruto's traits to main characters often seen in other manga series, McNulty felt that Boruto's growth across the anime series helped to make him more likable. Theatergoers for the Boruto film were given two different types of fans with one of them using Boruto and Naruto's images. Boruto's entire clothing is also being sold as merchandising.

The club's greatest success during play in the former East Germany was a single season spend in the second tier DDR-Liga in 1989‚Äì90, then under the name of Chemie Velten. After the German reunion, now as FSV Velten, the club earned promotion to the tier three Regionalliga Nordost in 1995 and played at this level for two seasons before being relegated again. The following season, 1997‚Äì98 the club had to declare insolvency in mid-season and folded. A new club was formed, the SC Oberhavel Velten, but has not reached the heights of the former club. History The formation of the FSV Velten dates back to 1912 when the Veltener BC 1912 was formed. VBC was outlawed by the Nazis in 1933 but reformed shortly after the end of the Second World War only to be renamed to SG Velten a little while later when the East German authorities reorganised all sports clubs. The club became BSG Industrie Velten for a while before returning to the SG name. The club won promotion to the 2. DDR-Liga in 1961, the third tier of the league system, and played at this level for two seasons before being relegated again in 1963. In between the team was renamed again, in March 1961 to TSG Velten.Geschichte SC Oberhavel Velten - History, accessed: 4 February 2015Historic German football league tables Das Deutsche Fussball Archiv, accessed: 4 February 2015 In July 1971 the club became Chemie Velten and the new club continued to play in the top level leagues of East Berlin and Brandenburg. In the final years of football in East Germany Chemie won the tier three Bezirksliga Potsdam in 1989 and earned promotion to the tier two DDR-Liga for the first time. The club finished in fourth place in the league but the political change in East Germany meant it lost fourteen of its players who departed for the West and consequently had its licence for the league revoked. In 1990 the club was renamed to FSV Velten 90 and entered the new Verbandsliga Brandenburg for a season but was immediately promoted to the tier three NOFV-Oberliga Mitte. From 1993 the club played in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord, initially with lower table finishes. When the Regionalligas were established in 1994 and the top Oberliga clubs entered this new league FSV's fortunes improved. It won its division in 1995 and was promoted to the Regionalliga Nord.NOFV-Oberliga Nord tables and results Weltfussball.de, accessed: 4 February 2015 At this level the club struggled, finishing fifteenth in 1996 and eighteenth and last in 1997, thereby being relegated again.

It is used to solve embarrassingly parallel problems: those problems that can be decomposed into independent subtasks, requiring no communication/synchronization between the subtasks except a join or barrier at the end. When applying the map pattern, one formulates an elemental function that captures the operation to be performed on a data item that represents a part of the problem, then applies this elemental function in one or more threads of execution, hyperthreads, SIMD lanes or on multiple computers. Some parallel programming systems, such as OpenMP and Cilk, have language support for the map pattern in the form of a parallel for loop; languages such as OpenCL and CUDA support elemental functions (as \\"kernels\\") at the language level. The map pattern is typically combined with other parallel design patterns. For example, map combined with category reduction gives the MapReduce pattern.

He is the namesake for Bleecker Street in lower Manhattan. Early life Bleecker was born in the town of New Rochelle, in Westchester County, New York to Jacobus Rutger Bleecker (b. 1716) and Abigail Lispenard (1718‚Äì1807). His mother was the daughter of Anthony Lispenard and granddaughter of Antoine L'Espinard. His paternal grandparents were Albany mayor Rutger Jansen Bleecker (1675‚Äì1756) and Catalina (n√©e Schuyler) Bleecker (1678‚Äì1747), of the Schuyler family. His nephew was James W. Bleecker, the fourth president of the New York Stock Exchange. Career He worked as a shipping merchant and real estate auctioneer in New York City, eventually becoming one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in 18th century New York. He was a Major in the 1st Regiment Provincials under Col. Henry Jackson in 1775. During the British occupation of New York City, the family lived in New Jersey. When General George Washington returned to Manhattan after the British evacuation in 1783, Bleecker was on the committee to officially welcome him back. Upon his own return to New York City, Bleecker started the family real estate and auctioning business. By 1792, 'Anthony L. Bleecker and Sons' were listed as stock brokers, and by 1818, members of the Bleecker family occupied four of the 28 seats on the New York Stock Exchange. His signature appears on the original list of subscribers of the capital stock for the Manhattan Company, later the Bank of Manhattan Trust Company. The list dates from April 1799.The Family Of Mary Noel And Anthony Lispenard Bleecker Bleecker also was involved in New York's historic Trinity Episcopal Church, situated across from Wall St. He became a vestryman there in 1785. He served until 1807 when he became a warden for five years. He purchased the family vault in its churchyard in 1790 where Bleecker family burials took place well into the 20th century. He was by far the most powerful Bleecker in New York City history. =Property= He owned the farm where the present-day Bleecker Street in Manhattan lies. His residence was 74 Broadway, across from Rector Street, where the Bleecker family lived for many years. The New York Times obituary of his grandson, Anthony J. Bleecker, (d. 1884) recalled the story of Bleecker coming into his house one day to announce he had bought 160 acres \\"out in the country\\" and that his friends laughed at him for wasting his money. That land would eventually become the present day Greenwich Village where Bleecker Street runs today.When Greenwich Village was FarmlandForgotten New York ‚Äì Bleecker Street The size of his land, and his political and business influence is well documented. However, it is probably the quality of his descendants in the 19th century, and the families they married into, which shows the respect he had. Among the names: Roosevelt, Neilson and Harriman.Gideon Tucker, 'Names of Persons for whom Marriage Licenses were issued by the Secretary of the Province of New York Previous to 1784,' (Albany, 1860), p.33.3. Personal life On May 4, 1763, Bleecker married Mary Noel (1743‚Äì1828). Mary, who was born in C√°diz, Spain, was the daughter of Garrat Noel, a member of a distinguished English family that was related to the Earls of Gainsborough, and Frances Matilda (n√©e Jayme) Noel.

Description The canarytop wrasse is a small fish that can reach a maximum length of 12 cm. It has a thin, elongate body with a terminal mouth. Body coloration is bright yellow and white with a few variations according to age. During the juvenile phase, the young wrasse is completely bright yellow with two black ocellus on the dorsal fin and one on the caudal peduncle. When reaching the initial phase, the body has two colors: white on belly and bright yellow on the back with the same ocellus, plus one more on the first spines of the dorsal fin. At the terminal phase, only a few changes occur, such as the head becoming a mix of yellowish and greenish with pinkish lines and with age the ocellus tending to blur. Distribution & habitat The canaritop wrasse is widespread throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian Ocean, from the Laccadive, Maledives, and Chagos archipelagos to the island of Java in Indonesia, including the Andaman Sea.Lieske & Myers,Coral reef fishes, Princeton University Press, 2009, This wrasse occurs in rubble and sandy areas close to coral reefs, from depths of 10 to 50 meters.Baensch, H.A. and H. Debelius, 1997. Meerwasser atlas. Mergus Verlag GmbH, Postfach 86, 49302, Melle, Germany. 1216 p. 3rd edition. Biology The canaritop wrasse lives in small groups. It is a benthic predator that feeds mainly on small marine invertebrates, such as crustaceans, molluscs, worms, and echinoderms captured on or in the substrate. Like most wrasse, the canari wrasse is a protogynous hermaphrodite, i.e. individuals start life as females with the capability of turning male later on.

According to Abdul Karim Soroush, the establishment of the Assembly was a counter-offensive of traditionalist Shiite Clerics inside the powerful elite against Tehran\`s Ecumenical Society () because they suspected it was developing tendencies to encroach upon the Sunnis. The following topics were discussed at the first conference: * Ahl al-Bayt and their scientific and cultural heritage; * Ahl al-Bayt's role in leading the Ummah; * Ahl al-Bayt's role in the unity of the Ummah; * Ahl al-Bayt's practical role in the maintenance of Islam; * Ahl al-Bayt and services of Islamic Revolution influenced by their teachings; * Human values and ideals of Ahl al-Bayt and the methods to implement them in social life; * The situation of the followers of Ahl al-Bayt and ways to support them and raise their dignity. Fundamentals =General Assembly= The General Assembly has a group of Islamic scholars and religious and cultural figures of the Islamic world as its members. According to the statute, the General Assembly is held every four years. The first was held in February 1994 and was attended by more than 330 members of this Assembly from 61 countries as well as scholars and researchers from different fields and Muslim countries. =Supreme Council= Some elite members of the General Assembly are or have previously been members of this council. According to the statute, members of this council are chosen by Vali- e-Faqih for five years. The council is responsible for the adoption of policies, programs, the budgets' assembly and supervision of the Executive Assembly. =General Secretary= The first General Secretary of this assembly was Ayatollah Mohammad-Ali Taskhiri, from 1990 until 1999. The second General Secretary was Ali Akbar Velayati., followed by Ayatollah Mohammad Mahdi Asefi. Hojjat al-Islam Mohammad Hasan Akhtari, a former Iranian ambassador to Syria, is the current General Secretary of the assembly. =Secretariat= The Secretariat is divided into the Department of Cultural Affairs, Department of International Affairs, Department of Executive Affairs, Department of Economic Affairs, Office of the Secretary General and the Planning and Supervision Office. Goals The following goals are declared in the statute: * Revival and expansion of Islamic culture, protection and defense of the Quran, tradition of Prophet Muhammad and Ahl al-Bayt; * Defense of the rights of Muslims, especially Shiites; * Strengthening Islamic unity in the face of the propaganda of enemies of Islam; * Preservation of the cultural heritage and honors of the Islamic civilization; * Development, improvement and reform of the cultural, economic, social and other aspects of followers of Ahl al-Bayt.

The specific name singu is Sinhalese for \\"horn\\" and refers to the horn-like tubercles on the upper eyelids of this frog. Common name Sri Lanka short-horned shrub frog has been coined for it. Description Four adult males in the type series measure in snout‚Äìvent length; females were not reported. The upper eyelid has a prominent tubercle. The snout is obtusely pointed in dorsal view and rounded laterally. The tympanum is distinct and oval; the supra-tympanic fold is distinct. The finger tips have discs with circum-marginal grooves; there is no webbing nor dermal fringes. The toes are webbed and bear discs with circum-marginal grooves. There are scattered tubercles in the head, back, and the flanks; skin on the throat, chest, belly, and ventral sides of thighs is granular. The head and body are dorsally and laterally brown. The inter-orbital area is dark brown, and there is a W-like marking on the middle of the dorsum. The tympanic region is blackish brown. The upper half of the tympanum is dark brown and its lower half is pale yellowish light brown. The lower flanks are yellow with brown pigment. The limbs have three dark-brown crossbars. The lower parts are dark brown with pale yellow patches. Habitat and conservation Pseudophilautus singu occurs in lowland and mid-elevation rainforests at above sea level. Males have been found perched in vegetation some above the ground. The eggs are laid in a depression in the soil; the eggs are later covered by the female. Development is direct, without free-living tadpole stage. Pseudophilautus singu has a patchy distribution but is common where it is found, except in Kanneliya where only a few specimens were found. It is considered to be a forest-dependent species. Forest reserves are at risk from encroachment by tea growers, and the associated use of biocides and fertilizers represent an additional threat to this species.

Luigi Comollo's tomb in the Church of Saint Philip in Chieri. Luigi Comollo often anglicized as Louis Comollo (7 April 1817‚Äì2 April 1839) was a seminarian at the Seminary of Chieri of Archdiocese of Turin. He is well known for being an intimate friend of Saint John Bosco. One of the famous and first book of St. Bosco was the biography of Comollo. Early life Born on 7 April 1817 in Pra, Cinzano, Italy, to Carlo and Gioanna Comollo. Comollo was a nephew of the Provost of Cinzano, Fr. Joseph Comollo. Comollo was often ill-treated by his classmates, but he never retaliated and always forgave them. Comollo‚Äôs actions made a great impression on John Bosco so much so that because of him Bosco took his spiritual life seriously. In his memoirs, Bosco recollects that Comollo taught him to \\"live as a Christian\\". In 1835 Comollo entered the Seminary of Chieri. Promise to Bosco John Bosco and Luigi Comollo were close friends. One day after having read a long passage from the lives of the saints, they talked about death and the consolation that would arise from knowing the state of the deceased person. At the end of the conversation they both drew up this contract: \\"Whichever of us is the first to die will, if God permits it, bring back word of his salvation to his surviving companion\\".Memoirs of the Oratory of Saint Francis de Sales from 1815 to 1855: Part II. The Second Decade 1835 to 1845 [II, 1]: Chapter 21. Louis Comollo‚Äôs friendship and Chapter 22. Louis Comollo's Death Bosco narrates that he entered the contract without realizing the gravity of such an undertaking; Nevertheless they ratified they contract repeatedly, especially during Comollo's last illness. According to Bosco, Comollo's last words and his last look at Bosco sealed his promise. Many of their companions knew about this contract. Death and apparition According to Don Bosco's memoirs, Comollo predicted his death at least one year before its occurring. At 2:00 am in early morning of 2 April 1837 Luigi Comollo, who was often sick, fell ill and died at the age of 22. On the next evening he was buried in nearby Saint Philip‚Äôs Church. That night, after Bosco went to bed in the dormitory which he shared with more than twenty other seminarians. Bosco says that he was convinced that this was to be the night when his promise would be fulfilled. According to Bosco, about 11:30 a deep rumble was heard in the corridor. It sounded as if a heavy wagon drawn by many horses were coming up to the dormitory door. It got louder and louder, like thunder, and the whole dormitory shook. The seminarians tumbled out of bed in terror and huddled together for comfort. Then, above the violent and thundering noise, the voice of Comollo was heard clearly. Three times he repeated very distinctly: \\"Bosco, I am saved.\\" All heard the noise; some recognized the voice without understanding the meaning; others understood it as well as Bosco did. Bosco records that it was the first time in his life he recollects being afraid. The fear and terror were so bad that Bosco fell ill to the point of death. After death The Rector of the seminary managed to obtain a special permission from the Authorities, which enabled Luigi to be buried inside the Church of St. Philip, adjacent to the Seminary at Chieri, Turin. A gravestone in Cinzano was put in honor of Comollo and his remains rest under the Altar of the Church of the Seminary of Chieri. His exemplary life won him private devotion amongst the seminarians. His tomb was desecrated by several of his companions who cut some fingers of his hand as relics. This hampered procedure to establish a cause of canonization in the Catholic Church. The Comune of Chieri created a museum project to allow the visitor into the rooms of the former seminary where Comollo and Bosco studied.

Founded in 2013, it is an all-through school which offers a multicultural and multilingual education leading to the European Baccalaureate as its secondary leaving qualification. TES is Estonia's largest international school, and the first of the Accredited European Schools, found across the European Union, to be established in the Baltic states. Multilingual curriculum Tallinn European School currently allows students to enrol in either the English-section or French-section. Students enrolled in the school are generally instructed in the language of the respective section. Students must choose from either English, French or German for their second language, which becomes the language of instruction for History and Geography curriculum from the third-year secondary, as well as the optional Economics course available from fourth year. Students are also expected to take a third language upon entering the secondary school. Students whose mother-tongue is not covered by a language section, are enrolled in the English section, and can opt for their mother-tongue in place of English-studies, taking English as their designated second language. At present TES provides classes in ten languages for mother-tongue or foreign language programmes. History Tallinn European School (TES) was founded in 2013 by the Innove Foundation, an independent \\"education competence centre\\" created by the Estonian Ministry of Finance. Initially based in a building at 2, Keevise Street, in the Tallinn subdisctrict of √úlemiste, the school moved to its current location at Tehnika 18, in the Tallinn subdisctrict of Kelmik√ºla, in August 2018 following renovation of the buildings. Campus and facilities The school's campus includes a canteen, a library and a gym, in addition to around 40 classrooms. It consists of three blocks (A,B, and C), with a total floor surface area of 7,200 square metres. =Railway heritage= Block A, originally built in 1880 for the \\"Tallinn Railway Technical School\\", is listed for conservation under Estonian law. A separate wooden structure, built in 1895, which constituted the railway school's main building no longer stands. Block A incorporates elements of Gothic Revival architecture, including a rose window, neo-Gothic arch windows, and stepped gables. The wooden ceilings, windows, and hinges were restored during renovations. Between 1926 and 1937, the building was used by the Tallinn French School, before, what was now the \\"Tallinn Railway Vocational School\\", reoccupied the building in 1939. The school building caught fire in 1969, and was reconstructed in 1978, with the addition of a new four-storey study hall, connected directly to the historical school building. Originally installed in 1974, a ≈†koda Works, Kc4-100 model, narrow-gauge steam locomotive, is still displayed on the school grounds commemorating the campus' railway heritage. Legal status Tallinn European School is a private school owned by the \\"Foundation Euroopa Kool\\", established by the Republic of Estonia, and under the remit of the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research. =Accreditation= The Board of Governors of the European Schools signed an accreditation and cooperation agreement with TES on 11 February 2014, which accredited the schools' nursery and primary sections, and the secondary section up to the end of year 5 (age 16). The agreement extends to 31 August 2019, when upon it will require renewal. A separate agreement was signed with TES on 21 May 2013 extending the accreditation status to secondary years 6 and 7, and enabling the school to formally offer the European Baccalaureate as its secondary leaving qualification. This agreement is valid until 31 August 2020. In concordance with the rigorous accreditation process, accredited schools are routinely audited by the Boards of Inspectors of the European Schools, with the TES' last audit taking place between 10 and 14 April 2017. =Relationship with the European Commission= TES is recognised as a \\"Type II\\" European School by the European Union (EU), permitting it to receive funds proportional to the number of pupils of EU staff enrolled in the school. The arrangement was made in large part due to the proximity of the EU's agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA).

It is native to the Indo- Pacific. Description The Half-and-half wrasse is a medium-sized fish that can reach a maximum length of 50 cm. Its body is high, relatively flattened, its head is large and its terminal mouth has thick lips. Its body coloration varies according to age. Juvenile wrasse have a greenish yellow background color with yellow vertical lines, a broad white diagonal band just behind the operculum, an orange caudal fin and a greenish gray front. Mature females are green behind the oblique line, with black-rimmed scales. A complex tangle of pink lines underlined with turquoise crosses from the top of the snout to the head. Mature males (terminal phase - see below) also have an emerald green stripe behind each scale and a blue rim around the eye; the top of the snout and head are green with pink patterns highlighted in turquoise. Distribution & habitat The species is widespread throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific, from the eastern coast of Africa including the Red Sea to Polynesia, and from New Caledonia to southern Japan. It prefers areas of coral, coral rubble and sand, outer reef slopes and drop-offs, to depths of at least 40 m. Juveniles are more secretive and always keep hidden in branching corals. Biology The Half-and-half wrasse lives solitary or in small groups. It is a benthic predator that feeds mainly on small marine invertebrates such as crustaceans, molluscs, worms and echinoderms captured on or in the substrate. In addition to picking food off coral branches, it may take in mouthfuls of sand, sorting out food items in the mouth and then expelling the sand through the gill operculae. Like most wrasse, it is a protogynous hermaphrodite, i.e. individuals start life as females with the capability of turning male later on. Conservation status The species is targeted but not thought to be threatened by the aquarium trade, and is being sought as a food fish and by spear fishers. It is present in several large preotected areas, and currently listed as Least Concern (LC) by the IUCN.

Description Hologymnosus annulatus has two colour forms which are geographically distinct, one in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea and the other in the Pacific Ocean. In both forms the females are very dark, appearing almost black while the males are mostly greenish with a blue face. The males of the Indian form have a white band in the middle of the body, while the males of the Pacific form show a pale area on the caudal peduncle when breeding. The body of the males is marked with numerous bluish- red bars and they frequently show a pale yellowish bar above the origin of the anal fin, the head is pale purplish in colour with green to blue-green bands radiating out from the eye, the one running to the snout broadens and branches. Juvenile H. annulatus bear a close resemblance to the juveniles of Malacanthus latovittatus. The juvelines are brown to olive brown and have 17-19 dark brown bars. They have a blue and black spot on gill cover, a black spot on side of lips with the spots on the lower lip being larger and the tail fin has a large whitish crescent near its end. Distribution Hologymnosus annulatus is distributed from the Red Sea south along the eastern, Indian Ocean coast of Africa to South Africa east to the Society Islands and Pitcairn Island in the Pacific its range extends north to southern Japan and south to the Great Barrier Reef and Rapa Island. Habitat and biology Hologymnosus annulatus occurs on coral reefs and areas of rocky substrate down to at least on offshore reef slopes. The juveniles are normally solitary. It is a carnivore and its diet is mainly made up of small fishes, although it also eats crustaceans. The juvelime fish frequent the bottom of the water column while the adults will swim relatively high in the water. They are pelagic spawners. Species description Hologymnosus annulatus was formally described in 1801 as Labrus annulatus by Bernard Germain de Lac√©p√®de in Volume 3 of his Histoire naturelle des poissons with the type locality given as Mauritius. Lac√©p√®de was following earlier work by Philibert Commerson. Human usage Hologymnosus annulatus is collected for the aquarium trade and is harvested by small scale subsistence fisheries.

It stars Katharine Isabelle as a woman whose plans for revenge become derailed when she suffers a fugue state and must piece together her memories. It was released in the US on 6 January 2015 and 8 May 2015 in Canada.  Plot  Confused and not sure where she is, Gwen comes out of a daze in a diner. She is surprised to find a pistol in her bag, and she accidentally shoots a waitress when the police confront her. Fleeing the diner, she returns to a hotel room that matches a key in her possession, though she can not remember any details of it. In her room, she finds a dead body, later revealed to be Winks, her best friend. A man shows up at the room and threatens to kill her, only to himself be killed by a man named Ty, who insists that they made plans to kill an underworld boss named Cyrus at the diner. Gwen, who does not remember Ty or their plans, denies that she would ever kill anyone, but she agrees to leave with him. Flashbacks reveal that Gwen blames Cyrus for the death of her boyfriend, Aster. After Gwen sees Cyrus with a dead woman, later revealed to be Ty's sister, Cyrus orders both Gwen and Aster killed. In the present, Gwen and Ty go to Lemmy, an illegal arms dealer, to procure new weapons. Before they can do so, Sheriff Knowles tracks them down, and Lemmy initiates a firefight. Lemmy is killed, and Ty is wounded as he escapes. Gwen, too frightened to take part, is arrested. Knowles attempts to piece together what is happening, and Gwen says that she has been framed by Cyrus. More interested in Cyrus than her, Knowles offers to make a deal with her if she can deliver Cyrus. At the same time, Ty assaults the police station and kills several police officers. As Gwen flees the station with Ty, she objects to any further killing, but Ty is killed in a crossfire. Gwen experiences further flashbacks, which reveal that she was responsible for several deaths while in a fugue state, including Winks' murder. Winks gave Ty and Gwen information on Cyrus' location, but Gwen became suspicious when Winks expressed concern for her welfare. Confused by these memories and still not understanding her own motives, Gwen returns to her quest to kill Cyrus. After she fails to talk her way out of the situation, she shoots and kills a police officer when he stops her for speeding. Confronting Cyrus, she blames him for all the deaths, but Cyrus denies responsibility. At his prodding, she remembers accidentally shooting Aster herself as she attempts to warn him of Cyrus' order. To give Gwen a chance of escaping prosecution, Cyrus tells her to blame him for the death and commits suicide by shooting himself in his mouth in front in her. The final scene is a flashback and returns to the diner, where Gwen prepares to ambush Cyrus. As Aster's favorite song plays on the jukebox, Gwen becomes distraught and enters a daze.  Cast   Production  In October 2013, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Lloyd joined the production. Lloyd said that he enjoyed working with Mullen and Doiron on their previous picture, Dead Before Dawn and was excited to play a villainous character. The initial idea for the story came from a dream that Mullen had. The idea had been in existence for a long time, but Mullen and Doiron wanted to establish a reputation through focusing on comedies before they ventured into a new genre. The script was first written in sequence, then adjusted to better represent the protagonist's fugue state. Shooting took place in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. They visited what they called \\"underbelly locations\\". Mullen considered it important to shoot on location. She used practical effects on set. Shooting took place between October and November 2013.  Release  Millennium Entertainment released the film on home video in the US on 6 January 2015. A Canadian release is planned for March 2015. It will have its world premiere at the Glasgow Film Festival. Mullen plans a special screening in Niagara Falls, Ontario.  Reception  David Berry of the National Post rated it zero stars and called it a clich√©d film that overexplains its plot. Though calling the film a calling card for the filmmakers, Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail rated it 2.5/4 stars and wrote, \\"The busy loop-the-loop plot and parade of goofy lowlifes preclude any real emotional investment in the material\\". Linda Barnard of The Toronto Star rated it 2/4 stars and wrote that the film's deliberate quirkiness makes it annoying, despite showing \\"visual promise\\". Mike Unsinger of The Georgia Straight wrote, \\"As much as the final payoff doesn't seem worth the time invested, at least no one can say 88 doesn't shoot high.\\" Tyler Foster of DVD Talk rated it 2.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"88 isn't bad; it's more overly ambitious, trying to do so much it ends up overwhelmed by technique rather than story and characters.\\" Gordon Sullivan of DVD Verdict wrote, \\"Fans of Katherine Isabelle and Christopher Lloyd might enjoy seeing some of the insane antics their characters get up to, but most viewers will want to give this revenge thriller a pass.\\"  References   External links  * * Category:2015 films Category:2015 thriller films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Canadian films about revenge Category:Films directed by April Mullen Category:Films set in Ontario Category:Films shot in Ontario ","title":"88 (film)"},{"id":"45292082","text":"Ophyx excisa is a moth of the family Erebidae first described by Gustaaf Hulstaert in 1924.

Work  = \\"Managing Legitimacy: Strategic and Institutional Approaches\\", 1995= In his article \\"Managing Legitimacy: Strategic and Institutional Approaches'\\", Suchman defines legitimacy as \\"a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions.\\" He later adds to this definition, stating that because legitimacy is socially conferred, legitimacy is independent of individual participants, while dependent upon the collective constituency. In other words, an organization is legitimate when it enjoys public approval, even though the actions of an organization might deviate from particular individual interests. Suchman states three types of legitimacy: * pragmatic legitimacy, * moral legitimacy, and * cognitive legitimacy. = Pragmatic legitimacy = Pragmatic legitimacy relies upon the self-interests of an organizations constituencies, in which the constituency scrutinizes actions and behaviors taken by the organization in order to determine their effects. This is further broken down into three sub-sections: * exchange legitimacy, * influence legitimacy, and * dispositional legitimacy. Suchman defines exchange legitimacy as the support for organizational policies due to the policy's benefit to the constituencies. Influence legitimacy is the support for the organization not due to the benefits that constituencies believe they will receive, but rather due to their belief that the organization will be responsive to their larger interests. Dispositional legitimacy is defined as support for an organization due to the good attributes constituencies believe the organization has, such as trustworthy, decent, or wise. This is due to the fact that people typically personify organizations and characterize them as being autonomous. = Moral legitimacy = Moral legitimacy is dependent upon whether the actions of an organization or institution are judged to be moral. In other words, if the constituency believe the organization is breaking the rules of the political or economic system for immoral reasons, then this can threaten moral legitimacy. Suchman breaks moral legitimacy down into four sub-sections: * consequential legitimacy, * procedural legitimacy, * structural legitimacy, and * personal legitimacy. Consequential legitimacy relates to what an organization has accomplished based on criteria that is specific to that organization. Procedural legitimacy can be obtained by an organization by adhering to socially formalized and accepted procedures (e.g. regulatory oversight). In the case of structural legitimacy, people view an organization as legitimate because its structural characteristics allow it to do specific kinds of work. Suchman refers to this organization as being the \\"right organization for the job.\\" Lastly, personal legitimacy refers to legitimacy that is derived from the charisma of individual leaders. = Cognitive legitimacy = Cognitive legitimacy is created when an organization pursues goals that society deems to be proper and desirable. Constituency support for the organization is not due to self-interest, but rather due to its taken-for-granted character. When an organization has reached this taken-for-granted status, an organization is beyond dissent. While moral and pragmatic legitimacy deal with some form of evaluation, cognitive legitimacy does not. Instead, with cognitive legitimacy society accepts these organizations as being necessary or inevitable.  Selected publications  * Suchman, Mark C.

The species was described in 1831 by Thomas Say. Bean weevils feed on vetches, beans and other leguminous plants. They are generally considered a pest species for this reason. Originating in Central America they have been inadvertently spread around the world in grain shipments. Taxonomy American naturalist Thomas Say named the bean weevil species as Acanthoscelides obtectus in 1831. Description Bean weevils are small beetles, ranging in size from 2 to 5 mm. They range in colour from light to dark brown, with longitudinal spots on their elytra, which has a red posterior border. Eleytra does not cover the abdominal end. Legs are yellow red and antenna red brown. The head is bent forward and lacks the long snout that is characteristic of true weevils. Eggs are milky white. Larvae are white with a yellow head during their first instar and white with a brownish head from the second instar. Larvae have bristles and three pairs of legs. Life cycle Bean weevils develop and feed upon leguminous plants. Adult bean weevils hibernate inside the seeds or seed pods of these plants. Adults emerge from hibernation in April to mate. Female bean weevils lay eggs onto seed pods, or into them by chewing holes, in groups of 2 to 20 eggs. A single female can lay up to 200 eggs. but 40 is average fecundity. Egg development can take 30 to 45 days before a 1st instar larvae merges. After approximately 3 days the larvae then moults and becomes a second instar larvae which then begin to consume the seed, with the larval stage lasting 3 to weeks in total. The larvae then pupates inside the seed, taking 9 to 29 days. The life cycle of a single generation takes from 100 to 110 days. If the seeds are stored in a warm place multiple generations can be produced one after another. Distribution and habitat Bean weevils are originally native to Central America, however grain shipments at the end of the 19th century introduced the species to Europe where it subsequently spread around the globe. It is now found in Europe, Asia, North and South America, Africa, Australia and elsewhere. The species favours warmer climates, with the most favourable temperatures being 27-29 ¬∞C for adults, 24-27 ¬∞C for larvae, and 22-26 ¬∞C for pupa. Temperatures higher or lower than this can cause a decrease in the number of eggs lain and they are very vulnerable to temperatures below 0 ¬∞C. This limits the species to how far north it can spread, and is found only as far north as northern Lithuania, with some being found in south-west Siberia. As parasite host A number of parasitoid wasp are associated with the bean weevil larvae.  As a pest species  The bean weevil is a significant pest in some parts of the world, especially in areas such as Australia where it is non-native. It damages crops both in situ and when stored in warehouses, and can potentially reduce crop yields by 60% as the larvae develop at the expense of the seeds.

The novel appeared in issues of the science fiction fan publication Science Fiction Digest (later Fantasy Magazine) published from July, 1933 through January, 1935. Cosmos has been described variously as \\"the world's most fabulous serial,\\" \\"one of the unique stunts of early science fiction,\\" and \\"a failure, miserable and near-complete.\\"  Plot summary  The opening chapter of Cosmos introduces the two primary protagonists of the novel: Dos- Tev, deposed Emperor of the planet Lemnis of the Alpha Centauri system, and his science advisor, Mea-Quin. Dos-Tev becomes aware that his usurper, Ay- Artz, is planning to extend his conquest to the planets of the Solar System. Unbeknown to Ay-Artz, Dos-Tev and Mea-Quin have created a ship capable of traveling faster than the speed of light. In order to foil Ay-Artz's plans and regain his throne, Dos-Tev sets out for the Solar System and establishes a base in the crater Copernicus on Earth's moon. He then proceeds to contact the races of the Solar System to enlist their aid in defending their planets once Ay-Artz's slower armada arrives. Chapters 2 through 5 describe the inhabitants of Mercury (a small band of human emigrants from Earth), Jupiter's moon Callisto (a race led by women), Mars (a race resembling large flying squirrels), and Saturn (cone-shaped beings who communicate via color) respectively. Each planet receives a message of warning from Dos-Tev and a request to send an emissary to an interplanetary conference to be held at Copernicus, and following a variety of adventures, each dispatches a ship accordingly. Chapter 6 returns to the story of Dos-Tev and Mea-Quin on the Moon as they continue to contact the planets of the Solar System and prepare for the conference. They encounter resistance from a strange, intelligent force they refer to as \\"the Wrongness of Space.\\" Chapters 7 through 9 tell the tales of Neptune (peopled by sentient gas-filled balloons), Venus (inhabited by migrated Earthlings), and Earth as they receive Dos-Tev's warning, select their emissaries and send ships to represent their planets at the conference. We learn that the people of Earth have been subtly subjugated by automatons of their own creation. In Chapter 10, Dos-Tev and Mea-Quin complete their preparations for the conference, despite interference from the Wrongness of Space. They successfully host the representatives of the planets and enlist them to return to their homes and build fleets of spaceships to defend the Solar System against Ay-Artz. In Chapter 11, the Earth is freed from the dominion of the automatons by a reclusive poet-musician-scientist. (This chapter, written by A. Merritt, was later adapted and republished as a short story named \\"Rhythm of the Spheres.\\") Chapter 12 describes a failed attempt by Dos-Tev and Mea-Quin to dispose of the Wrongness of Space. They discover that it is Krzza of Lxyia, a mad inter-dimensional dictator in league with Ay-Artz. Krzza captures them and then uses their communications equipment to direct false instructions to the planetary fleets intended to send them to their doom. Chapters 13, 14 and 15 tell the stories of the fleets of Earth, Neptune and Saturn as they cope with the disastrous misdirection sent to them by Krzza. In Chapter 16, Dos-Tev and Mea-Quin manage to escape the clutches of Krzza and make their way back to their ship. After defeating Krzza, they find their communication gear destroyed and must depart the Moon at maximum velocity to rendezvous with the Earth fleet. In the concluding Chapter 17, Dos-Tev and Mea-Quin reach the Earth fleet. They pass on intelligence regarding Ay-Artz's imminent arrival, but the intense gravitational stress of their journey kills them. The Solar System fleets converge under the command of Earth's Flight Director. After a titanic battle, the forces of Ay-Artz are defeatedwhile Pluto, Neptune and Uranus are completely destroyed in the process.

For example: > \\"Although Science Fiction Digest carried fiction, that was not its main > feature.

The story > had the overall title of Cosmos and ran for seventeen chapters, from July > 1933 to January 1935. Palmer provided the outline, which was rather old-hat > space opera, and then reached agreement with sixteen other authors to write > the series... The full line-up of writers in Cosmos was awesome‚Ä¶ They were > all top names in the pulps, but to be able to bring together both Merritt > and Smith in one serial was a bonanza for all fans.

It is some measure of the affinity that > existed between science-fiction devotees that writers were willing to spend > time and contribute stories free of charge to the fan press while, at the > same time, they were instigating legal proceedings against Huge Gernsback > for recovery of unpaid fees for stories. It is the clear distinction between > work done for fun and that for profit.\\" > \\"While literary editor at Science Fiction Digest, Palmer arranged one of the > unique stunts of early science fiction, the novel Cosmos, which consisted of > seventeen chapters assigned to different authors, printed as a serial. > Palmer loosely set up the plots of the chapters and adjusted them as new > sections were turned in, giving authors plenty of room for invention.

Elton Chong has mostly worked in South Korea with actors such as Eagle Han-ying, Casanova Wong, Michael Wong and Dragon Lee. While most of his work is with the director Kim Jeong Yong, Elton Chong often appeared in Godfrey Ho's movies, especially Hong Kong movies that were imported into Korea. He is perhaps best known for the movie Shaolin Drunken Monkey (known in Korea as The Shaolin Chief Cook.). Beginning of the career Elton Chong was first discovered by the director Lee Doo Young. He debuted as an extra in Charles Han's 1974 Korean action movie Korean Connection. During the late 1970s Elton Chong worked mostly as a stunt man or playing just minor roles.

Career in 1980s Elton gradually accelerated his career during the late 1980s when he started to worked with the director Kim Jeong Yong. By this period after the Hong Kong martial art actor Jackie Chan hit the scene with the movies such as Drunken Master, The Fearless Hyena and The Young Master, in Korea some of the directors desperately looked for the Korean star for the next hit. Like the Korean actor Dragon Lee (who was Bruce Lee imitator in Korea.) the directors looked for the imitators of Jackie Chan since by this period the comedy kung fu was major hit in Korea. Elton Chong finally made his first starring role in the movie Shaolin Drunken Monkey where he acts in similar ways to Jackie Chan's comedic kung fu template. Although his first starring role movie didn't amazed the whole world but Elton Chong quickly became famous in Korea. Some of his movies are often copied the Jackie Chan style of kung fu. For instance Elton Chong's 1982 movie Invincible Obsessed Fighter some how copied the idea from The Fearless Hyena.

Duncan Farm, also known as Brookvale Farm, is a historic farm property at 26 Shorey Road in Westfield, Maine. Built in 1910-12, the farm complex (consisting of a house, cottage, barn, and modern garage), it is a well-preserved family farm dating to the period of Aroostook County's heyday as a potato growing area. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Description and history The Duncan Farm is set on of land in north-central Westfield, abutting the town line with Presque Isle. The farmstead is set on the east side of Shorey Road, which runs through the property. The house is a two-story wood frame structure with vernacular Queen Anne styling. Its main gabled roofline runs east-west, with a lower projecting two-story ell to the south, and a single-story porch in the corner created by the projection. The house was built in 1912 by Henry Duncan. South of the house stands a massive gambrel-roofed barn, built by Duncan in 1910. Its west- facing main facade has a large sliding door at the center, topped by a transom window, with a smaller personnel entrance to the right. At the southeast corner of the property stands an abandoned 1-1/2 story cottage. The core of the farm property was purchased by Henry Duncan in 1904, with a potato house and small barn (both no longer extant) standing on it, indicating it had already been partly cleared and cultivated. Needing a larger barn to provide storage for hay and feed for his workhorses, Duncan built the large barn in 1910. The family typically planted in potatoes, another 50 in hay and oats, and left the remaining land fallow. They kept cows and chickens for personal use (the latter in a shed built off the side of the barn, which has since been removed). The type of barn Duncan built fell into decline with the advent of mechanized agriculture, for which the large hay and feed storage areas were not needed. Beecher Duncan, who succeeded to the farm after his father's death in 1915, acquired a gasoline-powered tractor in 1944, sold off his workhorses, and removed stalls housing them from the barn.

The following resolutions were passed unanimously:‚Äî 'That a Society, to be called the South Australian Society of Arts, be now formed, 'The annual payment of one guinea shall entitle the subscriber to all the benefits of membership, consisting in free admission to all lectures, meetings, and exhibitions of the Society. 'A donation of painting, sculpture, or other such grant of not less value than ¬£10 sterling, or of ¬£10 in money, shall entitle the donor to all the advantages of membership for life; the Society reserving the right to decline any unsuitable object. 'The Society to be governed by a President, two Vice- Presidents, and a Committee of 10 members, to be elected by the Society annually. 'This meeting requests Mr. Hill to secure promises of membership, and to convene a meeting of the members for arranging the operations of the Society as soon as 50 names are enrolled.' The meeting then adjourned until the time appointed by the prior resolution. ‚ÄòThat His Excellency Sir Richard Graves Mac Donnell be requested to be the first Patron of the Society.‚Äô ‚ÄòThat the Committee take the necessary steps to have the Society incorporated into the South Australian Institute.' We give publicity to this series of proposals, with a view of forwarding the interests of the new Society, by affording an opportunity to parsons favorable to its progress of considering and expressing their views regarding the contemplated arrangements. We do not, of course, suppose that with the materials at present in the colony any very rapid strides could be made in the development of works of art of any high pretensions. But the taste for the fine arts which exists without doubt among our community might be cultivated to a point that would give South Australia no mean position in this hemisphere. We have no doubt that this Society, if successful, will ultimately include a School of Design, and the exhibition of improvements in colonial manufactures. Under the proposed rules of the Society it will be perceived that the promoters already contemplate the exhibition of works of art, either 'pictorial, ornamental, or useful,' and in this they partially carry out the views we would express. It would be necessary to make the laws of the Institution on such a basis as would tend to encourage those manufactures adapted to colonial wants, and involve the development of colonial resources. A School of Art and Design would obtain a wider scope for its usefulness, and combine with a cultivation of graceful tastes an element of utilitarianism suited to the present position and future growth of the colony. Again, the proposed lectures or discourses on art might be made of immense benefit, if the topics discussed were not simply confined to a description of 'the line of beauty,' or the peculiarities of a classical profile. We imagine that the subjects, if selected with a view to the exposition of manufactures, agriculture, and chemistry, and the adaptability they would bear to colonial uses, would afford an attraction to every class in the community, and secure for the Society the popular support. In making these remarks we wish to be understood as cordially supporting the promoters in their project; but we conceive that a broader basis than that foreshadowed will establish the Society in greater strength and usefulness. The establishment of a gallery of art would doubtless bring to light many valuable works at present scattered in different parts of the province unknown or unappreciated. When such shall have been collected and classified, we believe great surprise and gratification will be experienced at the extent of our wealth in works of a high class. Probably many paintings of really good character have been brought to this colony, especially from Germany and France, in the possession of families to whom they have descended as heirlooms, and who have hung them upon their walls simply as relics long after the name of the master has been lost, and long after the subject has ceased to be distinguishable under the smoky accumulations of age. If these could be brought together, ample work would be provided both for the connoisseur and the Restoration Committee. 'In addition to works of this class it may fairly be anticipated that many creditable productions will find their way into the exhibition from the easels of colonial amateurs, many of whom are not only industrious, but also deserving of the title of clever artists. And if an exhibition offers advantages to any class of persons, surely the amateur will expect to reap the greatest benefit, for he will have all the influences of comparison and competition. With such prospects before them, we shall feel great disappointment if the promoters of the Society of Arts do not spiritedly carry out their enterprise. From the names of the Provisional Committee ‚Äî appointed to make rules and regulations for carrying out the objects of the Society‚Äî we feel assured that the project will be fairly started under the most favorable auspices, and with a good prospect of success.

Some sources speculated that he authored some of the literature works he collected. Baloviƒá wrote several manuscripts which are considered as significant literature works and historical sources. His multilingual dictionary is one of the earliest records of Albanian language. Julije Baloviƒá belonged to noble Baloviƒá family from Perast. Following his father's footsteps, he became a sailor in Venetian navy and advanced from the rank of ship's scribe to shipmaster. He received numerous awards and gratitude letters for his successful participation in battles against pirates and Ottomans during the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1714‚Äì18).  Family  Baloviƒá was born into the noble Baloviƒá family and lived in Perast (modern-day Montenegro). His father was Matija Baloviƒá who had seven sons and two daughters. Baloviƒá was married to Ana and had three daughters and four sons. Two of their sons died at a young age (Petar and Antun) while remaining the two sons (Julije and Petar) had no children so Julije's branch of the Baloviƒá family ceased to exist.  Sailing career  Baloviƒá began his sailing career in the Venetian navy as ship's scribe and gradually advanced to the ranks of pilot, lieutenant, captain and finally shipmaster. He served on different ships including \\"Santa Croce\\", \\"Santa Antonio\\" and \\"Santa Cristoforo\\". Baloviƒá participated in numerous naval battles with pirates from Tripoli and Ulcinj near Durazzo and ≈†ƒáedro and also in some larger military conflicts like Siege of Corfu, Battle of Preveza, Saseno and Battle of Vonjice. At the beginning of 1715 he was commander of frigate from Perast that together with ship of Venetian fleet commander Lorenzo Bragadin blocked two galleys of Ulcinj pirates from in one port in Venetian Albania. On that occasion he demonstrated his perfect knowledge of Albanian coast. Baloviƒá was the second generation of honorary guards and the keepers of the doge's standard on the Venetian flagship, which was also the position held by his father Matija. For his merits Baloviƒá has received a numerous diplomas and gratitude letters from different Venetian authorities. His sailing career lasted until 1718.  Literary career  While he was in Venetian quarantine in 1692 Baloviƒá transcribed Danica authored by Junije Palmotiƒá. He amended his transcription with three poems of unknown authors, including \\"Blind man sings of love events\\" () and completed it on 16 February 1692. In 1693 Baloviƒá wrote an Italian language manuscript Pratichae Schrivaneschae which contains a manual for scribes on ships. Two different versions were written. The shorter version, written in 1693, is preserved in the archive of Archbishopric of Perast. This manuscript contains calligraphic inscription of different alphabets including Latin, Cyrillic (Serviano) and glagolitic (Slavo Illirico) and a multilingual dictionary of the most often used words in everydays life on Italian (478), Slavo-Illirico (468), Greek (241), Albanian (201) and Turkish language(83). The longer version, without dictionary, was written in 1695 and is preserved in the Institute for Scientific and Artistic Work in Split. At the end of 1714 Baloviƒá began writing the Perast Chronicle, a collection of epic poetry which describes historical events related to Perast in the period between 1511 and 1716. Although this manuscript has been a subject of the significant scientific interest, it was never printed as a whole. It is assumed that Baloviƒá might be an author of one manuscript with transcriptions of official records and other documents, drawings of ships, short descriptions and legends related to events or ships drawn in this manuscript. = Bibliography = Baloviƒá's works include: * Danica (1692) ‚Äì transcription of Palmotiƒá's work with three poems * Pratichae Schrivaneschae (1693) * Pratichae Schrivaneschae (1695) * Perast Chronicle (1714‚Äì?)

In 2013, Moulik won the Sergey Yessenin Prize for promoting Russian literature.  Early life and education  Born in a well-to-do Bengali family on 1 July 1941, Moulik studied in the United States, UK and Italy graduating from the London University. On completion of her studies, Moulik wrote the Indian Civil Service examination and joined the Indian Administrative Service in 1964.  Civil service  Moulik served in the IAS till her retirement in 2001. She served as joint secretary in the Department of Education and Youth Services and director of the Karnataka State Archives. When the then director general of the ASI, archaeologist M. C. Joshi, resigned owning responsibility for ASI's failure to protect Babri Masjid, a protected monument, from demolition, the government of India appointed Moulik to succeed him. Achala Moulik was the first Indian Administrative Service officer to occupy the post. The appointment of Moulik as director general triggered a protest from professional archaeologists in the survey who felt that only a professional archaeologist was suitable enough for the post.Digging its own grave To placate them, the government appointed ex-Director General J. P. Joshi as special adviser to Moulik. But the arrangement did not work due to personal rivalry between the two. Joshi mustered support from the archaeologists in the ASI and tried to oust Moulik, but the government responded by dismissing Joshi instead. Moulik was transferred to Karnataka after a short term and succeeded by S. K. Mahapatra. The ASI continued to be led by civil servants till 2013. Moulik served as Additional Chief Secretary to the Government of Karnataka from January to June 2001. On the retirement of the then Chief Secretary S. K. Bhattacharya, Moulik was offered the post but she declined the offer and eventually retired.  Writing career  Since her retirement in 2001, Moulik has been writing books, both fiction and non-fiction, and translating works of foreign authors.

History  The company was founded in 1954 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands by Mr. Wientjes. The name Widemex comes from the combination Wientjes Demonstration and Export. The company started initially with selling products by demonstrating them in stores. The products they sold were exported to various countries in Europe. One of its products was the metallized ironing board cover, at that time a complete new technical product for their market. After several years the company decided to sell only fabric which was laminated with foam, especially produced for ironing boards. In 1970 the company was sold to the Nijhuis family. The new owners decided to move the company from Amsterdam to Geldrop, in the south of the Netherlands. The new owners stopped selling by demonstration and targeted on sales to larger companies and retailers. The production of ironing board covers became the company its core-business.  Decorated fabrics  In 1972 world‚Äôs first decorated ironing board cover was presented by Widemex. This turned out to be a desired product under the consumers and therefore the company quickly expanded their range of decorated ironing board covers. The company offered their ironing board covers to ironing board producers around Europe which on their turn implemented the decorated fabrics into their production. The company‚Äôs assortment extended during the years with the production of various kitchen textiles. However, due to the massive import of these products in the mid-nineties from China and India the company decided to stop producing these products. In the year 2000 the company was taken over by the Van der Maas family. The confection department was partly reduced after a reorganisation and therefore the company moved to a more appropriate location in Helmond, The Netherlands where the company is still situated today. Under supervision of the Van der Maas family the company extended their market share in Europe and became leading in her market segment. Today the company supplies ironing board covers to 35 countries over the world.
