It was directed by Jayson Thiessen, co-directed by Jim Miller, its screenplay was written by Amy Keating Rogers from a story by Thiessen. It was produced by Sarah Wall and Devon Cody. The episode aired on February 1, 2014, on the Hub Network. The episode centers on Pinkie Pie (voiced by Andrea Libman), whose plans to organize a birthday party for Rainbow Dash (Ashleigh Ball) are interrupted by a similarly energetic pony, Cheese Sandwich (\\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic), leading Pinkie Pie to defend her pride as a party planner in a \\"goof-off\\". Yankovic's involvement in the episode was the result of interactions on Twitter between him and Jayson Thiessen. Plot As he oversees an extravagant party he has thrown in Appleloosa, party planner Cheese Sandwich senses a \\"doozy\\" of a party being thrown in Ponyville, where Pinkie Pie is gathering supplies to organize her friend Rainbow Dash's birth + anniversary party celebrating both Rainbow Dash's birthday and anniversary of her move to Ponyville. Pinkie promises to throw Rainbow Dash the best party ever when Cheese Sandwich appears and introduces himself as the premier party planner in Equestria. Though initially delighted to meet a party planner like herself, Pinkie is upset as Cheese enraptures the townsfolk with an impromptu display of party-throwing skills, causing Rainbow Dash and the rest of Pinkie's friends to desert her in their excitement for Cheese's party. Cheese begins building a massive set for Rainbow Dash's party, while all except Pinkie help him build it. Doubting her own partying skills in comparison, Pinkie attempts several odd-end jobs around Ponyville that end in failure. She returns home dejected and begins to put her party supplies away before looking through an assortment of framed pictures showing various parties she has thrown for her friends and family in the past. With renewed confidence, Pinkie challenges Cheese to a goofing showdown (goof- off), declaring that the winner will be dubbed the single best party planner and headline Rainbow Dash's party. Cheese accepts, and Rainbow Dash is called upon to judge the competition. The two try to outdo each other with increasingly silly and elaborate performances until Pinkie accidentally drops a giant pi√±ata on top of Rainbow Dash. Pinkie realizes that she has let her pride get in the way of Rainbow Dash's party and forfeits the goof-off to Cheese. Pinkie packs up her belongings and prepares to leave Ponyville, deciding to let Cheese take her place. She is stopped by Rainbow Dash and her other friends, who apologize for neglecting her, but Pinkie counters that it's her fault instead, apologizing for her destructive pride and admits the Cheese is Ponyville's new party planner. However, her friends affirm that, while both are talented party planners, Cheese could never replace her as their friend. Cheese arrives and apologizes as well, assuring that he never meant any harm, but rather wanted to impress her with his own partying skills. He then confesses that, contrary to his previous claims of being a partier all his life, he was extremely shy as a colt until he stumbled upon a party thrown by Pinkie, which inspired him to become a party planner himself. Pinkie and Cheese make amends and work together to throw Rainbow Dash a spectacular party before Cheese makes a departure, leaving Pinkie his valued rubber chicken \\"Boneless\\" as a gift. Production \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic, as seen in 2010, guest stars as the voice of Cheese Sandwich. The episode was first teased by Hasbro Vice President of Development Mike Vogel during a panel at San Diego Comic Con International in July 2013, where he hinted about a musical season 4 episode where \\"somebody will give [Pinkie Pie] a run for her partying money.\\" The involvement of \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic in the episode stemmed from a Twitter post by the parody musician, where he had linked to a user-created music video with scenes from Friendship Is Magic episodes set to \\"Polkarama!\\", one of his polka medleys. The tweet was discovered by co-executive producer Jayson Thiessen, who posted a reply asking the musician if he would be interested in the idea of guest voicing a character on the show since \\"Weird Al and My Little Pony seem to go together really well.\\" After being met with a positive response from fans of the series, Thiessen received a private message from Weird Al about a year later, expressing his interest in participating. In the episode, Weird Al voiced a character named Cheese Sandwich, who is portrayed as being a rival to Pinkie Pie in the realm of party service. The episode was written by Amy Keating Rogers based on a story idea by Jayson Thiessen. In an interview with USA Today, Thiessen went on to say that they had gone \\"all out\\" with the episode's animation, that it contained \\"a couple special things that we've never done before\\", and that the episode had \\"a lot of great songs\\" as well. A short live-action cutaway with a dancing, live-action balloon animal version of Cheese Sandwich's rubber chicken Boneless (made using balloons and rice) was filmed in Thiessen's basement. Featured songs The episode is a musical featuring six songs with music provided by Daniel Ingram. Lyrics for the songs were originally penned by Amy Keating Rogers and reworked by Ingram. Rogers wrote the lyrics for the various songs with other melodies in mind: \\"Pinkie the Party Planner\\" was based on \\"Belle\\" from Beauty and the Beast, \\"The Super Duper Party Pony\\" on \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\" from Mary Poppins, \\"Pinkie's Lament\\" on \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" from Evita, \\"The Goof Off\\" on \\"Together (Wherever We Go)\\" as performed on The Brady Bunch, and \\"Make a Wish\\" on Pink's \\"Raise Your Glass\\". \\"The Goof Off\\" itself is similar to one of Yankovic's \\"polka medleys\\", made up of short snippets of songs set to polka music, and includes lyrics from Pinkie's \\"Smile Song\\" from the episode \\"A Friend in Deed\\" (also written by Rogers), as well as a portion of Yankovic's \\"W.A.Y. Moby Polka\\", which is the filler he uses in his polka medleys. While Shannon Chan-Kent sang as Pinkie for most of the songs, Pinkie's regular voice actress, Andrea Libman, performed the character during \\"The Goof Off\\". Ingram recorded the character Cheese Sandwich's songs with Yankovic in Los Angeles. A full version of the song \\"Make a Wish\\" is included on the album \\"Songs of Ponyville\\". # \\"Pinkie the Party Planner\\" ‚Äì Pinkie Pie, Mr. and Mrs. Cake, Diamond Tiara, and chorus # \\"The Super Duper Party Pony\\" ‚Äì Cheese Sandwich and Pinkie Pie # \\"Pinkie's Lament\\" ‚Äì Pinkie Pie # \\"The Goof Off\\" ‚Äì Pinkie Pie and Cheese Sandwich # \\"Cheese Confesses\\" ‚Äì Cheese Sandwich and Pinkie Pie # \\"Make a Wish\\" ‚Äì Pinkie Pie Steffan Andrews and David Corman helped with the orchestration and arrangements of every song except \\"Make a Wish\\". Broadcast and reception \\"Pinkie Pride\\" aired on February 1, 2014 on the Hub Network. The special was viewed by 459,000 viewers and was watched by approximately 0.3 percent of households in the United States according to the Nielsen household ratings. The episode received positive reviews from critics. Daniel Alvarez of Unleash the Fanboy gave the episode a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars, calling it a \\"really good episode and a very nice look at Pinkie Pie as a character\\", and praising the characterization of Cheese Sandwich and his rivalry with Pinkie, while noting the \\"mean\\" portrayal of Pinkie's friends as a minor setback. Raymond Gallant from Freakin' Awesome Network awarded the episode a rating of 10 out of 10, considering it \\"one of the season's best\\". Noting Pinkie's \\"moronic\\" portrayal in other episodes, Gallant wrote, \\"Not just being relegated to comic relief, we finally get a Pinkie that's funny, wacky, fourth wall breaking, and actually has a good heart to her.\\" He also praised the episode's humor, \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic's role as \\"a male version of Pinkie Pie\\", and the episode's use of musical sequences compared to the earlier musical episode \\"Magical Mystery Cure\\", writing, \\"the story had a chance to breathe, and be built up far better with all the songs added.\\" Ingram and Andrews were nominated for a 2014 Leo Award for their work on this episode for \\"Best Musical Score in an Animation Program or Series\\". In a Reddit \\"Ask me Anything\\" on the release of his subsequent album, Mandatory Fun, Yankovic stated that he \\"had a blast\\" performing as Cheese Sandwich and was \\"extremely happy\\" with the episode, and would be glad to reprise the role if the showrunners asked. Home media release The episode was part of the Season 4 DVD set, by Shout Factory, on December 2, 2014, as well as the \\"Adventures of the Cutie Mark Crusaders\\" DVD, which was released on February 24, 2015.

The club is made up of journalists and communications specialists from throughout the Central New York region. The organization is for those who work in print, broadcast, or Internet journalism. The press club is also open to those who work in communications or public relations for corporations, government, or not-for-profit organizations. It is governed by a board of directors, which is elected by its membership on a yearly basis. Club history In mid-April 1951, members of the Syracuse Chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, the journalism honorary, met at the former Merchants Bank on South Warren Street. But because only four had shown up, they immediately adjourned to the Waldorf Cafeteria less than a block away. Over coffee, Gene Cowen and Joe Porcello of the Herald-Journal, Ned Ryan, a television photographer, and Morgan Redmore, a former newsman then doing public relations for Solvay Process Company (Allied Chemical), discussed the principal problem of the Syracuse SDX chapter. The problem was what to do about a dispute with national headquarters over a bill for convention expenses which the local chapter maintained it did not owe. Almost simultaneously, Cowen and Redmore suggested the same solution: \\"Why don't we just tell National we quit, and start our own organization - a press club?\\" The Syracuse Press Club was born at that instant. For many years, the SPC maintained club rooms at the Hotel Onondaga, then at Midtown Plaza, and later at the Hotel Syracuse, where members could socialize and share a few drinks. Those days, unfortunately, are long gone, due in part to economic pressures and the changing nature of the media industry. The Syracuse Press Club was incorporated July 29, 1954 (although one document shows an Aug. 4, 1954 date). On April 27 of that year, papers were requested from the state Board of Standards and Appeals and filed on July 16. The document was signed by SPC President Richard A. Page, and board members Oley Sheremeta, Collin B. Weschke, Joseph K. Kensin, and Karel (Bud) Vanderveer. The attorney for the club was Maurice H. Sharp. Notable Guest Speakers Over the years, the club held a number of successful dinners, luncheons and other affairs. One of the club's most renowned speakers was Vice President Richard M. Nixon, who spoke at a 1960 dinner at the Hotel Syracuse, attracting a capacity crowd of 722. Other nationally-known speakers included Presidential candidate Ronald Reagan, Governors Nelson Rockefeller and W. Averell Harriman, Senators Barry Goldwater and Ted Kennedy, Rudolph Giuliani, and newsmen Bill Moyers, Richard Valleriani, and Ford Rowan. Annual Events The Club holds its annual Scholarship and Professional Recognition Awards dinner every May. The Club bestows dozens of awards to print, broadcast and new media journalists for stories and events they covered the previous year. The Club also awards a scholarship to a promising journalism student residing in central New York. Wall of Distinction The Wall of Distinction is where outstanding journalists in Central New York are permanently enshrined. The Syracuse Press Club's Wall of Distinction is located in the theater lobby of the John H. Mulroy Civic Center in downtown Syracuse. Over 60 legendary journalists make up the Wall.http://syracusepressclub.org/joomla/index.php?view=category&id;=2%3Apast- winners&option;=com_content&Itemid;=4 With help from Onondaga County Executive Nick Pirro, the Wall was placed in the Civic Center building. The first group of inductees was installed on Dec. 4, 2000, formally kicking off the Syracuse Press Club's 50th anniversary observance. In addition to plaques honoring inductees, there is a large plaque commemorating the SPC's 50th anniversary listing the names of the Club's presidents from 1951 to 2001. http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/10/syracuse_press_club_inducting.html List of Club Presidents *Current:.....Katrina Tulloch (Post-Standard) *1951/52......Joseph V.

The Parawa Junction Hotel was built in 1867, near where the main road crosses the Parawa Creek, to service traffic from the south coast to the central Otago goldfields and nearby goldfield at Nokomai. The hotel operated for a century, then was a tearoom for a number of years before closing.

History The line from Maldon to Shelbourne was opened on 24 March 1891. The line was originally planned to extend about beyond Shelbourne to Laanecoorie, but work on that section was suspended in 1890. Almost of earthworks and two trestle bridges had been built before construction was abandoned. The one intermediate station on the line was known as Bradford until sometime between 1912 and 1928, when its name was altered to Pollard. In late 1936, a proposal to close the Castlemaine-Maldon-Shelbourne line was met with protests. Consequently the line was not closed, but services were modified such that some rolling stock was allocated to the Echuca line. Closure A bushfire on 8 January 1969 destroyed a number of the wooden trestle bridges between Maldon and Shelbourne, which were deemed uneconomical to rebuild, forcing the closure of the line.

This wild territory, used for recreative activities (ATV, snowmobile, camping, hunting, fishing‚Ä¶) is managed by the \\"Sacerf Macousine Association\\". The mission of the Zec Kiskissink has multiple turns: forestry, wildlife and recreation. The outdoor enthusiasts can practice a variety of outdoor activities in the territory, such as fishing, hunting, camping (furnished and semi-furnished), hiking, trekking, mountain biking, canoeing. .. Zec also offers the possibility of renting fully equipped chalets, different boats (canoes, kayaks, rowboats) and motors.  Territory  Zec Kiskissink covers an area of . It is located in: * The city of La Tuque, Quebec and the municipality of Lac-√âdouard, Quebec, in La Tuque (urban agglomeration), in Mauricie; * Municipality Lac-Bouchette in Le Domaine-du-Roy Regional County Municipality and the territory of Lac-Moncouche, Quebec in Lac-Saint-Jean-Est Regional County Municipality, in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean; * The unorganized territory of La Jacques-Cartier, Quebec in the La C√¥te-de-Beaupr√© Regional County Municipality and the unorganized territory of Lac-Croche, Quebec in the La Jacques-Cartier Regional County Municipality in the administrative region of the Capitale-Nationale. Zec is located in Laurentian Mountains and covers an area where are the ridges of the watershed between the three major watersheds. Zec is bordered by Laurentides Wildlife Reserve to the east, by the Zec Borgia to the west and by the Zec la Petite Trinit√© southwest.  Toponymy  The name \\"Zec Kiskissink\\" originates from Lake Kiskissink, one of its major water bodies, located in the north-eastern part of the territory. This lake is located about 400 meters, just south of the line of the watershed between the Lake Saint-Jean and Saint-Maurice River; therefore it is part of the watershed of the St. Lawrence River. With a length of 12 km and a width of 1.4 km, Lake Kiskissink receives water from lakes Lescarbot and Ventadour, located to the south. Zec Kiskissink, c. 1900 Lake Kiskissink feeds the Bostonnais River and Grand Lake Bostonnais. The arrival of the railroad in the early 1890s, linking Hervey-Jonction and Lac-Saint- Jean, led to the implementation of a hunting and club near the lake outlet. Some pioneers implemented a hamlet. A post office was laid in 1889 under the name Kiskising; it was renamed Kiskissink in 1963 and closed in 1972. Today this hamlet is deserted and became a place called Kiskissink. This appellation of origin is both Algonquin and Montagnais and serve on small cedar. In Algonquin language, it consists of kijik, cedar, iss, a diminutive and ing, a renta. In Montagnais, the first component is kisk, the other being identical to Algonquin.

The site was founded in 1905 as the Topeka Industrial Institute by the African American educator Edward S. Stephens, as a school on its own farmland, more or less modeled on the Tuskegee Institute. The school closed in 1955.  Conditions  Conditions in the facility have long been identified as extremely problematic.

It is typically an expensive dish, due to the rarity of tiger penis. In some cultures and countries, people believe that the dish can enhance male virility‚Äîa notion that has not been supported by scientific evidence. There has been opposition to the dish from environmental organizations, and ongoing consumption of the soup has contributed to the decline of tiger populations. The legality of the dish varies in different countries, as tigers are a protected species. Overview Preparation involves soaking dried tiger penis in water and then cooking it along with other medicines and spices. Sometimes tiger bone is also included in the soup's preparation. Tiger penis soup has been sold for US$300 a bowl in China and other places in the Orient, and can cost as much as US$400. In 1998 in Southeast Asian and East Asian markets, the soup sold for US$350 per bowl. Prices are expensive due to the rarity of tiger penis. The dish is available and has been consumed in many Chinatowns throughout the world. Medicinal beliefs Some people and cultures in Asia believe that tiger penis soup acts as a medicinal aphrodisiac, can improve one's sexual performance or virility, or cure impotence. However, consumption of cooked animal genitalia does not increase testosterone levels in humans. Furthermore, there is no empirical evidence of tiger penis being correlated with sexual enhancement in humans. It has been stated that men may be fooled into thinking their sexual prowess is increased by consuming tiger penis soup due to placebo effects, in which the placebo effects act to counteract mild impotence, rather than the soup. Opposition In 1996, the Wildlife Conservation Society, an organization that focuses upon wildlife conservation, ran an international advertising campaign stating that claims of sexual potency being enhanced from consuming tiger penis soup are fraudulent. It has been stated that beliefs of tiger penis soup contributing to sexual enhancement has contributed to the endangerment of tiger populations, because of tiger poaching that occurs due to the high prices penises and other animal parts can command. Additionally, a high demand for tiger penis soup has significantly contributed to reductions in tiger populations. Legality Tigers are an endangered, protected species. It is illegal in some countries to consume tiger, and it has been stated that consumption of tiger is unethical due to the animal's endangered status. Consumption of tiger in the United States is illegal, but 60 percent of shops in New York City's Chinatown stated that they carry tiger parts in a circa 2010 survey. Some shops in New York City's Chinatown may sell deer or ox tendons, defrauding consumers by claiming that they're tiger penis. Tiger penis has also been counterfeited in China and Hong Kong, due to its high price.

Biography = Early life  Not much is known of Elemo's early life but by 1956 he had had an Islamic education and was living in Dire Dawa working for a wealthy Arab merchant who eventually took him to Aden, Yemen in 1956. He changed his name to Elemo Qiltu shortly after arriving in Aden. After marrying another Oromo living in Aden, Elemo started his own business which grew to be very successful.  Entering politics  He never cared much about politics but his house became an occasional meeting place for Oromo nationalists and by 1966, this began to attract the attention of the local Ethiopian Consulate. He was suspected of financing enemies of the Ethiopian government. In 1967, a Harari businessman working for the Ethiopian government, visited Aden from Ethiopia and borrowed goods from Elemo and promised to pay him back if he came with him to Addis Abeba, Ethiopia. Shortly after arriving in the city, Elemo was arrested and accused of involvement in anti-Ethiopian terrorist activities. Elemo underwent intensive interrogation, severe beatings and psychological torture which all led him to becoming more and more politicised. He was only let go after his friends raised money and bribed a prominent Ethiopian security chief. The time he spent in prison turned Elemo into a convinced Oromo nationalist and, upon his release, he began to involve himself with the Oromo nationalist movement that had sprung up in the country in the form of the Mecha Tullama Self-Help Association. In 1968, Elemo secretly went into Mogadishu, Somalia and attended a meeting of Oromo nationalists in which he was tasked with promoting Oromo nationalism to the Arab world. He moved back to Aden and formed an Oromo community association and managed to convince the city government of Aden to allow him to open a political office. He also sought support from different Arab governments as well as the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Eritrean Liberation Front. With the help of the Iraqi government, he was able to provide a seven-month military training programme for Oromo nationalists and organized them into an efficient guerrilla force. He dispatched the force under the leadership of his friend, Abdul Karim Hajji Ibrahim, more commonly known as Jaarraa Abbaa Gadaa. The group was ambushed, captured and imprisoned by Somali forces after trying to cross into Ethiopia from northern Somalia. Despite the setback, Elemo didn't lose hope and started smuggling and stockpiling weapons in Ethiopia through the Afar desert with the help of the Eritrean Liberation Front. Early in 1973, Elemo was invited to attend a clandestine meeting of all major Oromo underground movement leaders in Addis Abeba. This meeting led to the formation of the first Oromo Liberation Front and he was tasked with launching an armed struggle against the Ethiopian government.  Oromo Liberation Army  After the meeting, Elemo, along with a fellow Oromo nationalist Hundee Taqi, went to Gelemso to begin the armed struggle. There they met the famed Tadesse Birru who was under house arrest. Elemo began to secretly organize an armed force in the city and Hundee's father suggested he base the guerrilla force in an area called Guba Koricha in the Chercher Mountains. In May 1974, Elemo took twenty men and made a base camp in the mountains. They then began to attack the guards of Mulatu Tegegn, a local landowner who was notorious for abusing the local populace. They eventually killed Mulatu after he ordered the killing of a Muslim teacher in Gelemso. The killing of Mulatu shocked the region and the administrators sent their own troops to deal with the insurrection but failed. The local militias were unable to stop the guerrilla army which led the government of Ethiopia to send General Getechew Shibeshi to Gelemso with a large force. Elemo's army rarely engaged in long battles which made it hard for General Getachew to deal decisive blows to the guerrilla force. Getachew finally managed to surround the Oromo Liberation Army at the Battle of Tiro and managed to kill most of the force in the ensuing battle. Elemo surrendered but then blew himself up with a grenade when the government soldiers came to arrest him.  Legacy  Elemo Qiltu is considered a martyr by the Oromo people and he is immortalized in many poems by Sheikh Bakhri Sapalo and many Oromo nationalist songs.

Life  Johannes van Mildert was the son of the Antwerp painter Anthoon van Mildert (d. 1597) who had migrated to K√∂nigsberg. He was probably the pupil of Willem van den Blocke, another Fleming who had settled in K√∂nigsberg.Johannes van Mildert at the Netherlands Institute for Art History St Peter in the St. Rumbold's Cathedral in Mechelen After the death of his father he went to Antwerp, where he became a master in the Guild of Saint Luke in 1610. He possibly undertook a trip to Rome around 1608. It is believed that after 1620 he spent some time in Paris. He became a citizen of Antwerp in 1628.Iris Kockelbergh. \\"Mildert, Hans van\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 1 February 2014 In Antwerp he became friends with Rubens who had a similar background as they were both Flemings who were born abroad and had returned to their home town. When in 1633 Rubens was elected dean of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke he was allowed to leave the actual administration in the hands of van Mildert. His nickname 'den Duyts', which means 'the German', refers to the fact that he was born and raised in K√∂nigsberg, which was then part of Germany. He was married to Elisabeth Waeyens and his son Cornelis van Mildert was also a sculptor and draughtsman. His daughter Elizabeth married the sculptor Gerard van Opstal.Biographical details of Gerard van Opstal at the Netherlands Institute for Art History His son Cornelis and his son-in-law Gerard van Opstal completed some of the works left unfinished at the time of his death.Master ivory carvers: Gerard van Opstal  Work From about 1617 onwards van Mildert received multiple large commissions as a sculptor-architect and maker of small-scale architectural stone church furniture. He thus became the main competitor of the workshop of the brothers Hans and Robert Colyns the Nole that had dominated the Antwerp market from the beginning of the seventeenth century.Aanbidding door de koningen. Val√©rie Herremans, ‚Äò‚ÄôHans Van Mildert, uitvoerder van de kleinarchitecturale omlijsting en de sculptuur?‚Äô‚Äô In: Rubensbulletin Year 2, 2008 St John in the St. Rumbold's Cathedral in Mechelen He initially worked in a mannerist style. The monumental alabaster mantelpiece which he made in 1618 for the wedding hall of the Antwerp City Hall followed the Mannerist style of Cornelis Floris de Vriendt and may have been based on a drawing of Floris. Around this time van Mildert started working in the Baroque style of his friend Rubens. In 1618 he executed a black and white marble altar made for the Chapel Church in Brussels based on a design by Rubens. This structure (now in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode) was the first stone altar in the shape of a porch in the Southern Netherlands. Rubens also commissioned van Mildert to make the famous separation wall with arches in Rubens‚Äô residence in Antwerp. He further executed Rubens' design for the Waterpoort, a gate that was originally part of the Antwerp defence walls.De Waterpoort Despite the baroque nature of his architectural work, his figure sculpture did follow the non-dynamic forms of the Renaissance style. His image of Saint Gummarus for the baroque altar erected in 1620 in the St. Gummarus Church in Lier is heavy in proportions, unrealistic in detail and static in its pose. Later works such as the marble statue of the apostle Simon in 1638 in the St. Rumbold's Cathedral in Mechelen are, however, livelier and realistic. This is also true for sculptures made after designs by Rubens such as the image of St. Michael fighting with the devil, made for the church of the abbey of St. Michael in Antwerp and now in the St. Trudo Church in Zundert.Hans van Mildert on 'Thuis in Brabant' Peter Paul Rubens, St. Norbert Overcoming Tanchelm, ca. 1622‚Äì23 Van Mildert played an important role in the development of the design of Flemish Baroque religious furniture. In this area of Baroque sculpture in the Southern Netherlands he made his most important contribution since the quality of his figure sculptures lagged behind his Flemish contemporaries Artus Quellinus and Fran√ßois Duquesnoy. Because of his reputation in this field, he got in 1616 the commission for the design and execution of the main altar of the St. John's Cathedral in 's-Hertogenbosch. A drawing and painting of this altar by Pieter Saenredam have been preserved and parts of the altar are now in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

History An earlier Beaminster Grammar School existed in the town in the 18th century, and one of its Masters, the Rev. Samuel Hood, was the father of two admirals, Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood (1724‚Äì1816) and Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport (1726‚Äì1814).A. M. Broadley, Nelson's Hardy (1909), chapter 1 'Dorset and her Sailors' This school had closed by 1820. The later grammar school was founded after the closure of a school called the Beaminster Classical and Commercial School, which came to an end in 1868. Originally for boys only, the new school took boarders as well as day boys.Richard Hine, The History of Beaminster (Taunton: Barnicott & Pearce at the Wessex Press, 1914), pp. 385-387 In 1904, Dorset County Council made the school a specialist centre for agriculture. A fund was opened to provide more accommodation, and the local member of parliament, Colonel Robert Williams, donated ¬£300.'Court Circular' in The Times newspaper, issue 37566 dated 1 December 1904, p. 6 Writing about the 1910s fifty years later, old boy Ralph Wightman recalled that \\"The masters were kindly, and corporal punishment was almost unknown. I was at Beaminster under two Headmasters, and the second, Mr L. Skyrm, did not cane anyone...\\"Ralph Wightman, Take Life Easy (1968), p. 50 After the First World War, the school merged with a similar establishment in neighbouring Netherbury and was renamed the Beaminster and Netherbury Grammar School.The Education Authorities Directory (1924), p. 235 It was by then co-educational, which was unusual for a secondary school in the first half of the 20th century. In 1923, an Old Boys' and Old Girls' Association (OBOGA) was founded.Katy Potatie, Alumni of Beaminster and Netherbury Grammar School are celebrating 90 years of reunions dated 05/07/2013 at beaminster.net, accessed 1 February 2024 In the 1920s, some children were still coming to school on horses. In the 1930s, the number of pupils was about 130.Marie de G. Eedle, A History of Beaminster (1984), p. 188 In the 1950s there were both weekly and termly boarders, the boys sleeping at School House in Hogshill Street, the girls at Tucker House on the other side of the road, until later the girls were transferred to a house called Woodlands on the Bridport Road and Tucker House became a second boys' house.

Located within the Metro Health Village, it is the main hospital for Metro Health: University of Michigan Health and functions as a teaching osteopathic medicine hospital. It serves more than 130,000 people in the Grand Rapids Metropolitan Area and is one of the only hospitals in the area that is not located in or near the Grand Rapids Medical Mile. History=Founding In the 1940s, Louis M. Monger, an osteopathic physician who had been working at the Detroit Osteopathic Hospital, sought to introduce osteopathic care to the residents of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Monger and a group of osteopathic physicians decided to set aside their personal resources to create a hospital dedicated to holistic care. It was decided to purchase the previous home of the bishop serving for the Diocese of Grand Rapids at 1225 Lake Drive in Grand Rapids, MI and nearly $50,000 was raised to equip the hospital. After some delays due to rationing during World War II, Grand Rapids Osteopathic Hospital opened in December 1942 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Andrew Taylor Still's creation of osteopathic education. The hospital's first patient was Louisa Porcelli, wife of the hospital's Secretary-Treasurer James V. Porcelli, DO, who gave birth to their first child in the nearly finished hospital. Louisa had to be carried up the stairs and placed in the only functioning room in the hospital. Metropolitan Hospital In 1958, the Grand Rapids Osteopathic Hospital moved to 1919 Boston SE Grand Rapids, MI. The hospital was originally equipped with only 28 beds. By the late 1970s, the hospital had grown to include over 200 beds. After decades of growth, the hospital was renamed Metropolitan Hospital so it could be represent the multiple specialties now working with patients. By the 1990s, Metropolitan Hospital was seeking to expand. On December 2, 1996, the hospital's president and CEO Michael Faas unveiled a new organization called Metro Health, with the hospital partnering with over 130 physicians to create clinics throughout western Michigan. In May 1999, a $40 million proposal to expand that included the purchase and destruction of 55 homes in the area was opposed by residents in the area. By October 2000, Spectrum Health was expanding throughout the area while the hospital still lacked neighborhood support, resulting in a decision to construct a new facility elsewhere. Metro Health Hospital Metro Health logo used from 2007 to 2016. On March 12, 2001, it was announced that the hospital was attempting to purchase 150 acres in Wyoming, MI to create a \\"health care village\\". The decision was made after years of remaining landlocked on its 17-acre property in Grand Rapids with residents denying expansion. The site was located near three major freeways; M-6, U.S. 131 and I-196, situated among the growing suburban area outside of Grand Rapids. It was chosen after studying population growth patterns and because of its size, which would allow the hospital to make multiple expansions. In 2009, the University of Michigan Health System and the Metro Health Cancer Center initially began a partnership with cancer treatment. Over time, clinical relationships began to develop between the two entities. On December 15, 2016, Metro Health officially announced its affiliation with the University of Michigan Health System. With the University of Michigan Health System having some of the most advanced resources and expertise in the United States, patients are able to receive more specialized treatment at the hospital. Services Metro Health Hospital has an emergency department certified as a level II trauma center, child birth services, neurosciences, medical care, surgical care, intensive care, and diagnostic/imaging services. Its specialty services include cardiac care, stroke center, joint replacement, neurosurgery, assisted breathing center, sports medicine and wound care.

It can form partly stable solid salts with heavy alkali metals. They are more stable than nitratoborate salts. K[B(ClO4)4] decomposes at 35 ¬∞C, Rb[B(ClO4)4] is stable to 50 ¬∞C, and Cs[B(ClO4)4] can exist up to 80 ¬∞C. Perchloratoborates are analogous to perchloratoaluminates ([Al(ClO4)4]‚àí). Another related anion is the chloroperchloratoborate, Cl3B(ClO4). Boron perchlorate itself is unstable above ‚àí5 ¬∞C. Decomposition On thermal decomposition the alkali perchloratoborate salts form an alkali perchlorate, and boron trioxide as a solid residue, and gas containing dichlorine heptoxide, chlorine dioxide, chlorine, and oxygen. :2 M[B(ClO4)4] ‚Üí 2 MClO4 \\\\+ B2O3 \\\\+ (3 Cl2O7 or 6 ClO2 \\\\+ O2 or 6 Cl2 \\\\+ O2) When the alkali perchloratoborates first start to decompose at the lower temperatures, the reaction is endothermic, and dichlorine heptoxide is formed. However, if caesium perchloratoborate is heated the decomposition becomes exothermic above 90 ¬∞C, and at 100 ¬∞C it explodes exothermically forming chlorine and oxygen. Reactions When rubidium perchloratoborate is reacted with extra perchloric acid, it forms RbBO(ClO4)2. In water, alkali perchloratoborates decompose exothermically to form boric acid, perchloric acid, and the perchlorate. Formation Nitronium perchloratoborate (NO2B(ClO4)4)can be formed by reacting nitronium perchlorate with boron trichloride in solution. Similarly ammonium perchlorate reacts with BCl3 forming ammonium perchloratoborate. The metal perchloratoborates can also be formed from the metal perchlorate dissolved in anhydrous perchloric acid reacting with boron trichloride. Another way is to react a metal chloridoborate (MBCl4) with perchloric acid. Chloridoborates can be made from the metal chloride and boron trichloride dissolved in nitrosyl chloride.

The exact time period the grave was created is unknown and has been determined to be between 1499 and 1719 AD by carbon testing. Overview The press and media carried the news in headlines following the excavation conducted by the Sri Lankan authorities in Mannar which led to the discovery of a mass grave in 2013. According to the police, the site was allegedly used for mass burial of civilians and soldiers alike killed by the Tamil rebels during the war. Mannar and most of the northern part of Sri Lanka were under the control of the rebels for almost 30 long years. The long battle ended in May 2009 after the government forces vanquished the Tamil rebels. The discovery of the Mannar grave led to further investigation in Matale, central Sri Lanka, which bore 150 human skeletons. The Director General of Archaeological Department of Sri Lanka whom had been instructed by the Mannar Magistrate to investigate and report on the \\"Mass Grave\\", announced on 8 April 2014, that the site is a normal burial ground which had been used since 1930s. He had further explained, how it had been identified as a normal burial ground and not a mass grave, but proposed further investigations. Carbon dating of the skeletons tested from the mass grave belonged to an era from 1499 to 1719 AD. The carbon testing was carried out by the Beta Analytic Institute of Florida, USA.

The movie, which was partially funded through crowdsourcing, stars Robert Englund as a psychiatrist that tries to cure phobias by using extreme methods. The film received its world premiere on 22 October 2014 at the Screamfest Horror Film Festival and was released on DVD in the United States on 10 February 2015. Plot Sara (Fiona Dourif) is one of five people that developed PTSD after surviving a bloody shooting attack in a small diner by a masked shooter, which had the unfortunate side effect of either worsening pre-existing phobias or developing new ones. Like the others, she sought treatment from Dr. Andover (Robert Englund), a brilliant scientist and doctor that developed a new way of treating fear-related ailments by way of his \\"Fear Chamber\\". Initially the treatments seemed to be a success, but years later the patients have all returned to the clinic due to their fears re-emerging worse than they had before. After urging from her best friend Megan (Cleopatra Coleman), Sara returns to the clinic as well. Andover is reluctant to resume treatment because one of his previous patients, Paige (Bonnie Morgan), died as a result of her treatment in the Fear Chamber. He ends up giving in due to both the patients and his assistant Osborn (Felisha Terrell) insistence that this is the only way to solve their problems. However he finds that his reluctance may have been well-founded as one of the patients, Caylee (Angelina Armani), vomits a black substance that gives Andover a strange vision once he touches the fluid. The vision shows a monstrous version of Paige that states that Andover's treatments opened a passage for a sinister being to come over and that all that it needs to finish its travels is for Andover to resume treatment and \\"open the door\\". Realizing that this is not Paige but the creature itself, he is shocked back to consciousness. While settling in, a new patient by the name of Blake (Thomas Dekker) arrives in the clinic. His mother reveals that he was also one of the victims of the shooting, but that he had only recently began to develop severe night terrors that she believes are related to the attack. Blake is unable to communicate with others due to a head wound that left him with a brain injury that has limited his mobility and made him need a wheelchair. Andover begins treatment on Blake, which they discover has the unintended side effect of healing his brain injury and giving him the ability to speak once more. This, along with his earlier vision of Paige, makes Andover believe that something sinister is at work and that Blake's miraculous healing only occurred so he could once more feel fear, which the creature needs to exist. Megan, who had previously checked herself in the clinic before and has now done it again to be with Sara, has a small cyst on her back and has Osborn cut into it. Osborn sees that the same black fluid that Caylee vomited earlier is leaking from Megan's wound. Andover begins to suspect that Blake is hiding something, as Blake is reluctant to discuss some elements of the shooting during a therapy session. This proves to be the case after Blake discovers a mask identical to the one worn by the shooter. A series of flashbacks reveals that Blake was not a victim of the shooting but the perpetrator himself and that his head wound was a botched suicide attempt. Wandering through the building, Sara discovers Andover's records where he states that the creature is actually a manifestation of fear and that his Fear Chamber was effectively starving it of what it needed to survive: more fear. Andover is pulled into a strange cocoon- like structure on the wall, which enables the fear creature to take over his body. Meanwhile, Blake ended up succumbing to the influence of fear and becomes the shooter once more. He then proceeds to murder one of the clinic's employees while the fear creature incapacitates or kills several of the clinic's inhabitants through its influence. Sara encounters Blake, who chases her until she remembers a statement Andover made about Paige- that her time in the Fear Chamber incapacitated her but that she did not die until her eyes were closed. Sara realizes that although this killed Paige, it also deprived the fear creature of its food source. She manages to close Blake's eyes. She then does so to Caylee, Bauer (Corey Taylor) and Osborn, but the creature attacks her before she can get to Megan. Dylan (Brandon Beemer) kills himself, depriving the creature. Sara saves Megan's life and closes her eyes, after which Andover is freed from the influence of the fear creature- only for him to say that this is not over and that the creature will only return and try to open the door once more. Sara replies that the only thing left is to \\"change the locks\\", and the film ends with Andover stepping into the Fear Chamber to receive treatment while Sara oversees the process, reversing their positions.

The movie would expand upon the basic story of the original series and bring back Englund, Danielle Harris and Lucas Till. The original Fear Clinic had in fact been intended as a feature-length film, entitled Fear Chamber, but was turned into a shorter episodic format. Hall raised part of the funding for this film by using the fundraising site Indiegogo, and actress Fiona Dourif and Slipknot's Corey Taylor were confirmed to be performing in the film. Harris and Kane Hodder, initially intended to reprise their roles, later withdrew from the project. Filming began in Medina, Ohio during December 2013 at a former nursing home and a local diner. Of the film's script, Hall commented that it would be darker and more surreal in tone than the web series. Shortly after Fear Clinic moved into post-production, the distribution rights were picked up by Anchor Bay Entertainment and it released in October 2014. The special effects were created by Steve Johnson. Reception Critical reception was mixed. We Got This Covered panned the film as \\"underwhelming\\", writing \\"Fear Clinic is an ambitious project stitched together by unsteady hands, as the threads holding everything together threaten to unravel come the film's end.\\" In contrast, Bloody Disgusting praised the film, which they felt \\"[wasn't] an amazing film, but [had] enough interesting ideas going on with some pretty great practical effects that make it a slightly above average film.\\" ReferencesExternal links  Category:2014 films Category:2014 horror films Category:Films shot in Ohio Category:English-language films ","title":"Fear Clinic (film)"},{"id":"41807235","text":"Li Sisi (; born 4 November 1986) is a Chinese television host and media personality.

It was included as an extra in the DVD release of the documentary in 2005, digitally restored.Craig (2009), p. 10-15 Plot The film opens to close-ups of \\"a gun holding a six- gun in its holster\\". A young cowboy (played by Ed Wood) is introduced, who according to the narrator sold his herd of cattle at San Antonio for top dollar. He is now seen riding in a crossroads town in the vicinity of Laredo, Texas, looking for an old friend. He is soon ambushed by another cowboy, called Tex (Don Nagel) who first disarms him and then shoots him in cold blood.Craig (2009), p. 10-15 Later, Tex heads for the local saloon, and the narrative introduces two other main characters: Lem (Duke Moore) and Barbara (Ruth McCabe). They are old friends who are seen walking together. But Tex wants Barbara, and he soon manages to kiss her. Lem chooses not to interfere, and Tex proceeds to propose marriage. According to the narrator, Tex has had many women and knows just what to say to sweep Barbara off her feet.

He also explains his suspicion that Tex kills men for money, then confesses his own love for her. He offers to kill Tex for her.Craig (2009), p. 10-15 The two gunfighters meet in a fight at the streets of the small town, and Lem bests his rival. Tex is fatally wounded and soon dies; only four prostitutes are seen mourning for him. The camera then follows his funeral procession to the grave. Barbara leaves Tex's gun and holster on the wooden cross of the grave. Lem chooses the funeral as his moment to surrender to the local sheriff.Craig (2009), p. 10-15 The crowd attending the funeral turns into a lynch mob and the sheriff is willing to execute Lem without a trial. Then Barbara approaches the prisoner and gives him a passionate kiss. She informs the crowd that she loves the man. No longer eager to avenge the widow, the crowd releases Lem.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1980 United States presidential election. State voters chose four electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States. Utah was won by former Governor of California Ronald Reagan, the Republican nominee, who was running against incumbent President and former Governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter, the Democratic nominee. Reagan ran with former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Carter ran with Walter Mondale, incumbent Vice President and former senator from Minnesota. Reagan won the election nationally by a landslide. Utah was the most Republican state in the nation. Reagan‚Äôs win in Utah during the 1980 election remains the most recent occurrence during a United States presidential election in any state of one candidate receiving a plurality exceeding half the total votes polled. Reagan won Carbon County by a mere three votes, but comfortably beat Carter, who was widely criticized for his inability to understand issues specific to the West (especially water development)Reisner, Marc; Cadillac Desert: The American West and Its Disappearing Water; p. 11 everywhere else.

Background  The first Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) unit was a small guerilla force that started out with twenty men (later grew exponentially) and operated in the mountains around the city of Gelemso. After the OLA killed Mulatu Tegegn, a notorious local landowner, the government sent General Getachew Shibeshi and a large force to deal with the guerilla army. The General was unable to deal any decisive blows against Elemo's troops but was able to keep them pinned in the Chercher Mountains. The OLA unit eventually snuck away from the Chercher Mountains and made their way to Tiro, a mountainous region between the towns of Gelemso, Bokhe Tiko and Badhesa.  Battle  In late August 1974, the Oromo Liberation Army unit came down from the Chercher Mountains and made their way closer to Gelemso hoping that the fully grown crops would be able to hide them from General Getachew's troops as they made their way closer to the surrounding towns of Bokhe Tiko, Gelemso and Badhesa. They had chosen a mountain in the area of Tiro as a new base of operations and proceeded to climb it. Three of their new recruits; Hundee Taqi, Sheikh Jamal and Colonel Mahdi were unaccustomed to climbing long distances so they spent the night around the bottom of the mountains while the rest of the soldiers camped at the top. When a soldier was sent to retrieve the recruits, it was discovered that the three had been killed by a government militia that had followed the unit to Tiro. Before long, police and more militiamen from the three nearby towns started arriving at the base of the mountain surrounding it. The Oromo Liberation Army soldiers took high positions and began to engage these troops managing to kill most of the poorly trained militia. Elemo Qiltu, the OLA commander, was injured and so he descended down from the mountain and began to engage troops from the surrounding crop fields. The fighting continued from dawn until noon, when General Getachew's troops finally arrived from the Chercher Mountains and began to shell the mountain. The government troops also surrounded Elemo Qiltu, leading to his surrender. He called for the soldiers to come and pick him up since he was injured, but blew himself up with a grenade as the Ethiopian soldiers approached him. The government troops managed to get midway up the mountain, capturing a few rebels, but were unable to capture the rest who broke their lines and escaped.  Aftermath  The Ethiopian government punished the population in the area by instigating a wave of mass arrests and killings in the surrounding towns of Gelemso, Boke, Badhesa, Mechere and Balbaleti. The armed wing of the Oromo Liberation Front did not resume operations until 1976, when the group reorganized.

He is known for his photographic work of Barbie dolls, which caused some controversy resulting from a lawsuit brought against him by Mattel. The company lost the case when the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the images were original artwork in 2004.  Art Work  Forsythe is known for his famous \\"Barbie\\" portraits, portraying Barbie dolls in surprising situations usually without clothes and often juxtaposed with some sort of kitchen or cooking appliance. This line of art is called the \\"food chain Barbie\\". In each composition, Forsythe shows the world as seemingly mad: his work has been described as \\"unappetizing\\": in the words of judge Pregerson, \\"In some of Forsythe's photos, Barbie is about to be destroyed or harmed by domestic life in the form of kitchen appliances, yet continues displaying her well known smile, disturbingly oblivious to her predicament\\". The main reason behind Forsythe's use of the Barbie is that the doll is seen as an American icon. Forsythe chose to use the dolls in his art because he wanted to attempt to put the sexist idea to rest. When Barbie came out, the doll was supposed to represent beauty and gave a false idea how woman were supposed to look and act. Marjorie Heins, in her book Will Fair Use Survive, said, \\"the benefits to the public in allowing such use - allowing artistic freedom and expression and criticism of a cultural icon - are great\\". She also said \\"it serves the aims of the Copyright Act by encouraging the very creativity and criticism the act protects.\\" According to Forsythe, the Barbie represents the idea of ‚Äúperfection‚Äù and how women are supposed to look and act.  Court case  Forsythe's art theme called ‚ÄúBarbie's power as a beauty myth‚Äù attracted legal attention. After displaying his work at art fairs in Utah and Missouri, Mattel Inc. took notice of his use of their copyrighted doll. Mattel objected to the fact that Forsythe had been using the image of their product, and they sued Forsythe in 1999 for copyright and trademark infringement. After several years of appeals, a federal judge instructed Mattel to pay Tom Forsythe legal fees of more than $1.8 million. The 9th Circuit Court ruled that Forsythe's art did not violate 'fair use', which allows use of copyrighted material where the work will be provided to the public. Because of this, they ruled in Forsythe's favor that the Copyright Act applied in the case of his work.  Reactions  Many artists and feminists were glad to hear that Forsythe had won the case. To them the case made a statement, that copyright is \\"destructive to the free exchange of ideas\\". To Forsythe, the case was a victory in the fight for free speech. He felt that he was using a form of art to show how political and social ideals play in our world today. Forsythe felt that the case taught him a lesson about the US legal system. In his own words, ‚ÄúFrom what I‚Äôve learned in the course of defending my very basic free speech rights, this is a fairly standard cost of fighting a legal battle in federal court. It only confirms what I‚Äôve always sensed, that the legal system is little more than a boxing ring for the rich with the common people not even invited to experience the proceedings on pay per view. We may be free to express ourselves, but if that expression involves offending a rapacious corporation, they‚Äôre equally free to sue; and unless we have the wherewithal to fight off high powered attorneys, that‚Äôs where our free speech ends.‚Äù  Current Work  Tom Forsythe is the owner of the Little Hollywood Museum in Kanab, Utah and has been a Tai Chi instructor for over 20 years. His current work has included setting up an online Tai Chi Class at taichiclass.org.

It includes Canberra Airport and some farming but little residential development. Geography The Majura District is situated in the northeast corner of the ACT, to the east of the North Canberra district, Mount Ainslie and Mount Majura, north of the Molonglo River, west of Sutton Road and south of the New South Wales border. It is located in the Majura Valley, which is drained by Woolshed Creek. Majura is primarily covered by the Majura Field Firing Range, open grazing country and Canberra Airport. Majura Parkway, which was officially opened on 22 April 2016, and Majura Road run through it from the north to the south. Majura District is not generally zoned for residential development, partly because of the nearby airport. Its only significant settlement is Pialligo, which lies on its southern edge and is semi-rural in character. The Majura Park Gun Club and Australian Federal Police driver training facilities are located on the northern part of Majura Road and a forensic facility is being built. The Majura Vineyard is located further south and includes the Mount Majura Solar Farm. The Majura Park Shopping Centre is on airport land at the southern end of Majura Road. A large IKEA store opened on non-airport land opposite the Airport on Majura Road on 16 November 2015. The Royal Military College, Duntroon and the Australian Defence Force Academy lie to the south of Fairbairn Avenue on the edge of the Majura district. In 2011, the Majura district contains 14 rural holdings in a thin strip along Majura Road between the nature reserves to the west and the defence, Airport and AFP land to the east. It was observed that \\"no-one in the Valley is a farmer, as they don‚Äôt receive their main income from farming.\\" However, since 2011 properties such as Majura House have begun engaging with the community through sustainable paddock to plate farming including free range eggs, spring lamb, and corn. The company was known as Majura Valley Free Range Eggs has become a recognised and respected brand within the Capital and surrounds and an important preserver of farming within the region. The Mount Majura Solar Farm Mount Majura solar farm The Mount Majura Solar Farm is built on part of the Majura Vineyard that was cut off by the Majura Parkway project. It has a rated output of 2.3 megawatts and was opened on 6 October 2016.  History  The Majura Valley was used by the Ngunnawal people (Australian Aboriginals) before settlement by Britons in the mid-1820s and 1830s. Settlements were scarce, and recent surveys show that this was likely a transitory camping area during nomadic journeys between Lake George and the upper Yass River catchments. A Scotsman, Robert Campbell settled the area, having been granted land in 1825. His compensation grant was 4,000 acres (16 km2) of land and 710 sheep, after Campbell's ship the \\"Sydney\\" was lost off the coast of New Guinea while chartered to the New South Wales government. Campbell named his property Majura probably after \\"Majura in India\\", according to the ACT National Trust. In 1825 James Ainslie by assignment of Campbell started a sheep station in the area which today is Canberra. Campbell named the property Duntroon. The origin of this name was Duntrune Castle at Argyll and Bute in Scotland. The house was later acquired for the establishment of the Royal Military College and eventually became its mess. Campbell was assigned convict labourers, but also sought to bring free settlers as farm workers. These people were settled on small holdings of around 2 acres. Such a holding appears to be \\"Majura House\\" which is reputed to have been built for Alfred Mayo and his family between 1846 and 1860, the house remaining in family ownership until 1981. By the mid-1850s there were approximately 50 people residing in the Majura Valley (see links). Following land reforms in 1861, other families sought free selection of Crown Land in the Majura Valley in the 1860s and by the late 1800s had established what was a proto-village with school, community hall and Post Office, near the \\"Avonley\\" property. By 1891 there were 83 dwellings, housing 393 people within the Majura Valley. A major land holder was the Harman family. Creation of the Federal Capital Territory in 1912 ended freehold title, with the land becoming Commonwealth lands that were then leased to former occupiers. The Majura District was designated by the Districts Act of 1966 as one of the 18 districts of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).

He was born at Coochbehar, West Bengal. He is the youngest child of Satish Chandra Deb and Sabita Deb. He is most known for his classic novel, Lohitparer Upakatha (2010).  Personal life  He studied in Jenkins School, Coochbehar, and completed matriculation in 1978. Then he studied at Mariani College, Mariani, Assam under Dibrugarh University and from A.B.N. Seal College, Coochbehar, under North Bengal University. Between 1981 and 1992, he edited various magazines and journals. He moved to Guwahati in the year 1993 and joined the Bengali Daily Newspaper \\"Ganapatrika\\" as Chief Sub-Editor and then changed to the Bengali Newspaper \\"Samay Prabaha\\" in 1994 and worked there till the year 2000.

His wife, Kabita is a former journalist and a freelance writer. He lives at Jyotikuchi, Guwahati.  Works  Samar Deb is renowned as a fiction writer, and justifiably so. But he writes poems as well and \\"Aalo Andhokar\\" (Light & Darkness) and \\"Amma Tera Munda\\" (Mom, your Son) are arguably his most acclaimed collection of poems. Samar Deb over the years consistently contributed to various little magazines, journals, etc. which together constitute a promising alternative mode of literary culture in Assam and Bengal that challenges the influence of big capital. It is equally noteworthy that his writing style deconstructs the gentle middle class and sub-altern ethos of the society. Most of his characters belong to the lower strata of existence. His fictions reinvigorate the received Bengali language with forceful idioms and expressions from the margins, which might often bombard the chaste taste of a Tagorean upper and middle class, still very much under the spell of a 19th-century Victorian sensibility.

Human powered BANDRA-WEST-SKYWALK Women bicycling along Pune streets Walking has constituted a major form of transport in ancient times.This mode of transport has always been a first foot for humans. People even used to cover long distances on foot.In rural areas of Maharashtra even now that is a common mode of transport. In many cities in the state like Mumbai or Pune, to make it safer and efficient for pedestrians, a number of skywalks have been proposed or are under construction.For example, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, has commenced the construction of more than 50 skywalks, Bicycles or cycles, have high ownership in the state. the state level. Along with walking, cycling accounts for significant number of the commuter trips for those in the informal sector in both rural and urban areas.From many decades, Pune was known as the cycle city of India. However, the cycle was replaced by motorized two-wheelers from the 1970s onwards. Today, government development authorities are encouraging the setup and use of separate bicycle lanes alongside the roads to combat pollution and ease traffic congestion. Animal powered Bullock cart hauling Sugarcane Historically, bullock carts have been the most common mode of transport for goods and to a lesser extent for people in Maharashtra.Bullock carts are still used in rural areas for transporting goods from home to the farm or produce such as sugarcane to the sugar mill. The khilari has been the most popular breed for draft oxen.Momongan VG. Reproduction in draught animals. Draught Animal Power for Production. ACIAR Proceedings. 1985 Jul 10;10:123-9.

During the British colonial era the horse drawn Tanga and Victoria were popular modes of transport in urban areas.From the 1960s onward, they were gradually replaced by the motorized three-wheeler Autorickshaw, for intermediate public transport.Donkeys are still used on building sites for carrying sand but, unlike the middle-east, they have not been used for riding.

The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) has been providing passenger road transport service in the public sector since 1948, linking most of the towns and villages in and around the state with a large network of operation. These buses, popularly called ST (State Transport), are the preferred mode of transport for much of the populace. In addition to the government run buses, privately run luxury buses also ply between major towns. Other modes of public transport, such as a seven-seater tempo have gained popularity in semi-urban areas.

IR is divided into eighteen zones. The IR are further sub-divided into sixty seven divisions, each having a divisional headquarters. Maharashtra is well- connected to other parts of the country with a railway network spanning 5,983 km. Many zonal, and divisional headquarters of Indian railways are based in different cities of the state. * The Central Railway and the Western Railway zones of the Indian Railways that are headquartered in Mumbai, at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus and Churchgate respectively, * The Nagpur Junction has the division, Nagpur (Central) & Nagpur (South East Central) of Central Railway & South East Central Railway respectively. * The Nanded division of the South Central Railway that caters to the Marathwada region of Maharashtra and * The Konkan Railway, a subsidiary of the Indian Railways based in CBD Belapur, Navi Mumbai that serves the Konkan coastal region of Maharashtra and continues down the west coast of India. Maharashtra also has suburban railway networks in Mumbai and Pune that carry around 6.4 million passengers every day. In addition to this, Maharashtra also has metro rail and mono rail networks. Currently Mumbai Metro is operational while metro at Nagpur, Navi Mumbai, Nashik and Pune are under construction. Nashik metro is proposed by NMC and Greater Nashik Metro project is implemented by Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited to connect city with the suburban areas like Nashik Road, Nashik Airport (ozar) and sinnar. Mumbai Monorail is set to become the fifth- largest monorail system in the world, also Navi Mumbai Monorail, Pune Monorail and Nagpur Monorail are proposed. Mumbai had tram service until the early 1960s when it was replaced by expanded Bus service.http://www.tramz.com/tva/in.html Air transport Civil aviation in Maharashtra began in the 1920s with the establishment of Juhu Aerodrome as of one of the first aerodromes in India. It served as a base for J.R.D. Tata's Tata Airlines in the 1930s. The Maharaja of the princely state of Kolhapur, constructed an airfield in his city in 1939 and offered a subsidy to Air Services of India to operate an air service to Juhu. By the 1940s, small airstrips had been built at Phaltan, Sangli, Akola and Gondia. in addition to the bigger airfields at Santacruz, Pune and Nagpur built by the Indian Air Force which were also used for civilian operations. During the 80's and 90's, Vayudoot served as many as ten airports in the state. The booming Indian economy, growing tourism industry, entry of low-cost airlines, liberalisation of international bi-lateral agreements and liberalisation of civil aviation policy at the centre towards the turn of the century has resulted in an unprecedented growth in air traffic.  Airports  Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport is among the busiest airports in World Most of the State's airfields are operated by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) while Reliance Airport Developers (RADPL), currently operate five non ‚Äì metro airports at Latur, Nanded, Baramati, Osmanabad and Yavatmal on a 95-year lease. The Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) was set up in 2002 to take up development of airports in the state that are not under the AAI or the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC). MADC is playing the lead role in the planning and implementation of the Multi-modal International Cargo Hub and Airport at Nagpur (MIHAN) project. Maharashtra has three international airports: * Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (among the busiest airports in India); * Pune Airport with flights to Dubai, Frankfurt and Sharjah; * Nagpur's Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport. * Nashik Airport serves domestic flights. Airports at Akola, Amravati, Baramati, Chandrapur, Dhule, Gondia, Jalgaon, Karad, Kolhapur, Latur, Nashik Road Airport, Nanded, Osmanabad, Ratnagiri, Solapur and Yavatmal do not have any scheduled air services. There are also private airstrips at Aamby Valley City and Shirpur. A greenfield airport is being built by the MADC at Shirdi while IRB Infrastructure is constructing Sindhudurg Airport. A new passenger terminal at Ozar Airport near Nashik was inaugurated in March 2014. Navi Mumbai International Airport, being built by CIDCO for is in the land acquisition stage. The New Pune International Airport is being planned near Pune as well as greenfield airports at Boramani (near Solapur) and Gadchiroli. Water transport Ship being unloaded at Mumbai Port Historically, the ports on the Konkan coast have served as the gateway to the Deccan region. most of these have diminished importance but do serve as fishing ports.The two principal sea ports of maharashtra and also of india, Mumbai Port and Jawaharlal Nehru Port, which is also in the Mumbai region, are under the control and supervision of the government of India. There are around 48 minor ports in Maharashtra. Most of these handle passenger traffic and have a limited capacity. None of the major rivers in Maharashtra are navigable and so river transport does not exist in the state.

Background The fighting broke just as the normalization annex of the Bangsamoro Framework Agreement was signed between the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Col. Dickson Hermoso, spokesman of the Army‚Äôs 6th Infantry Division, claimed that the offensive was not related to the signing of the annex of the peace treaty and said that the government has been collaborating with the MILF to launch an offensive against the BIFF even before the signing of the annex. The government offensive was part of an effort to arrest various BIFF leaders including its leader, Umbra Kato for various crimes. The Philippine National Police has issued a warrant of arrest for various BIFF leaders. Hermoso described the offensive as a \\"law enforcement\\" effort by government forces. The offensive is part of Joint Ad Hoc Joint Action Group, a joint effort by the Philippine government and the MILF to eliminate lawless elements from MILF communities. The offensive=January 28 Philippine military launched an artillery attack on BIFF targets with 105-mm howitzers. The military also conducted airstrikes. At least 20 BIFF members were killed according to the government. BIFF spokesperson, Abu Misry Mama denied that there were casualties on their side. January 29 BIFF spokesman, Abu Misry Mama said that the BIFF is open for negotiations with the government. He said that the BIFF is disappointed with the treatment of the government of their group. He said that the government keeps sending heavily-armed forces to their communities on which he said forces the BIFF to retaliate. The BIFF wants a \\"straight to the point\\" and \\"direct\\" peace negotiation compared to the negotiations between the Philippine Government and the MILF, according to the spokesman. Mama added that the BIFF longs for an independent state where everyone is equal. Col Dickson Hermoso, spokesman of the 6th Infantry Division, turned down the BIFF's request for negotiations and said that the BIFF must first face criminal charges against them. January 31 Lt. Col. Ramon Zagala, Armed Forces public affairs office chief said that government forces has seized at least five strategic BIFF camps. He identified the following locations; the headquarters in Barangay Dasawao, Shariff Saydona Mustapha, a training facility in Barangay Ganta, Shariff Saydona Mustapha, an improvised explosive device factory in Barangay Ganta, Shariff Saydona Mustapha and advance posts in Barangay Bakat, Shariff Saydona Mustapha and Barangay Damablas in Datu Piang. The casualties according to government forces includes 53 BIFF fighters, including 3 child soldiers and one soldier from the Philippine government side. The BIFF continues to deny that there were casualties on their side. February 1 The government planned to end the offensive on February 1, the second deadline set by the Joint Ad Hoc Joint Action Group. BIFF spokesman Abu Misry Mama said that they captured and torched an armored personnel carrier (APC). The spokesman said that they can't utilize the vehicle due to the lack of roads in their area so they decided to torch the vehicle after removing the 50-caliber machine gun attached to the vehicle Government forces captured the main stronghold of the BIFF in Barangay Ganta, Shariff Saydona Mustapha. The flag of the Philippines was raised at the former BIFF camp. February 2 The Armed Forces of the Philippines formally ended Operation Darkhorse. Col. Dickson Hermoso, 6th Infantry Division spokesman, claimed that the government forces has significantly lowered the morale of BIFF fighters following the capture of at least four strategic BIFF camps. The military declared that civilians displaced due to the operation may now return to their homes. The military added that their law enforcement operations will continue despite the formal conclusion of Operation Darkhorse. \\"AFP focusing on neutralizing BIFF‚Äôs IED-making capability  News  GMA News Online\\". www.gmanetwork.com. There is no official confirmation that Ameril Umbra Kato, leader of the BIFF was killed or captured during the military operation.

At the time of description P. cristatus was one of two Pseudarmadillo species known from the fossil record and one of only two from Hispaniola. History and classification Pseudarmadillo cristatus is known from ten isopods of various developmental stages and both female and male all of which are inclusions in five different transparent chunks of Dominican amber. Six of the paratypes are in the same amber specimen as a spider, a mite, and a myrmicine ant, while the two juvenile paratypes are in a single amber also. The amber specimens which entomb the holotype and paratypes, are currently preserved in the Division of Invertebrate Zoology collections at the in Stuttgart, Germany. The type specimens were collected from an undetermined amber mine, in fossil bearing rocks of the Cordillera Septentrional mountains, northern Dominican Republic. The amber was produced by the extinct Hymenaea protera, which formerly grew on Hispaniola, across northern South America and up to southern Mexico. The amber dates from at least the Burdigalian stage of the Miocene, based on studying the associated fossil foraminifera and may be as old as the Middle Eocene, based on the associated fossil coccoliths. This age range is due to the host rock being secondary deposits for the amber, and the Miocene the age range is only the youngest that it might be. The fossil isopods were first studied by paleontologist Helmut Schmalfuss of the Staatliches Museum f√ºr Naturkunde Stuttgart. Schmalfuss's 1984 type description of the new species was published in the journal Stuttgarter Beitr√§ge zur Naturkunde. Serie B (Geologie und Pal√§ontologie) and no explanation of the specific epithet cristatus was given. The 6 paratypes entombed in the same amber are accompanied by the Aphaenogaster amphioceanica holotype ant.  Description  The Pseudarmadillo cristatus specimens are moderately well preserved, though since isopods lack the wax coatings found in insects, they show deterioration and distortion from the resin after entombment. The specimens has an estimated adult body length of approximately and a width of . The body shows two ribs running the length of the body on each side. Two rows of bumps run the width of the body between the ribs on each body segment, a front row of five bumps and a hind row of four bumps. The cephalon has notably enlarged antennal lobes that served to shelter the antenna when an individual curled into a defensive ball. The compound eyes of the species are composed five ommatidia.

History and classification Aphaenogaster amphioceanica is known from a solitary fossil insect which is an inclusion in a transparent chunk of Dominican amber along with a spider, a mite, and six woodlice. The amber was produced by the extinct Hymenaea protera, which formerly grew on Hispaniola, across northern South America and up to southern Mexico. The amber specimen, number Do-4629-B; which entombs the holotype, is currently preserved in the Division of Invertebrate Zoology collections at the in Stuttgart, Germany. The holotype was collected from an undetermined amber mine, in fossil bearing rocks of the Cordillera Septentrional mountains, northern Dominican Republic. The amber dates from at least the Burdigalian stage of the Miocene (16-20 Ma), based on studying the associated fossil foraminifera and may be as old as the Middle Eocene (about 40 Ma), based on the associated fossil coccoliths. This age range is due to the host rock being secondary deposits for the amber, and the Miocene age range is only the youngest that it might be.

De Andrade's 1995 type description of the new species was published in the Swiss journal Stuttgarter Beitr√§ge zur Naturkunde. Serie B (Geologie und Pal√§ontologie).

The six woodlice were described as paratypes of the extinct species Pseudarmadillo cristatus in 1984. Description The Aphaenogaster amphioceanica specimen is well preserved, though the ant shows distortion from the amber moving after entombment. The specimen has an estimated body length of approximately . The overall coloration of A. amphioceanica is a moderately shining light brown, with the legs slightly lighter in tone. The head is oval in shape with a \\"neck\\" that is slightly shorter than the neck. The antennae have a long scape that extends for 3/5 of its length past the back of the head capsule and the four end segments form the antennal club. Large distinct ribs are found on the lateral sides of the antenna sockets on the head capsule. The propodium is notable in having two spines long that point upwards and backwards. The combination of \\"neck\\", antenna socket ridges and short sharp spines on the propodeum are unique. The antenna socket morphology is closest to that of several living species found in the Indomalaysian region.

It originally aired on October 15, 2009. The episode was written by Kevin Williamson and Julie Plec and directed by Marcos Siega. Plot The episode starts from exactly where the previous episode ended where Elena (Nina Dobrev) asks Stefan (Paul Wesley) what he is. Before Stefan gives her an answer, there is a flashback to 1864 and we see Katherine and Stefan meet. Back in 2009, Stefan admits that he is a vampire and Elena freaks out running away even though Stefan tries to explain. He follows her to her home to promise he will not hurt her and he lets her know that he drinks animal blood and it was Damon (Ian Somerhalder) who killed all those people. Elena is still freaked out though and she asks him to leave. Damon is at the cemetery trying to cover his tracks after killing Vicki's (Kayla Ewell) friends. He calls Stefan asking for his ring while he douses the bodies with alcohol to burn them. Stefan says he will give Damon his ring back but not right away. They hang up and when he goes to Vicki to douse her too, she wakes up. The next day Elena meets Stefan at a public place to talk things over. Stefan answers her questions referring to vampires but she is mad at how he let Damon play with Caroline (Candice Accola) like that. Stefan agrees that it was not right but it is more dangerous to forbid Damon to do something. He also tells her that years ago, people in Mystic Falls knew about vampires but because it did not end well so he asks her not to tell anyone. Elena is not sure about that but she agrees to give him one day to convince her not to do it. Sheriff Forbes (Marguerite MacIntyre) and Logan (Chris Johnson) find the bodies and they know that what killed them was a vampire. Logan informs her that he managed to take the Gilbert watch and now they have to take it to the Mayor (Robert Pralgo). The Mayor gets the watch and fits it into one of the other antiques, he says that it is ready and he hands it back to Logan. Damon is trapped at the house since he cannot get out to the sunlight and he is getting impatient waiting for Stefan to bring him his ring. He brought Vicki at the house who is lying on the couch. He decides to feed her his blood even though he says that he will regret it. Vicki feels much better after drinking the blood and the two of them have fun around the house dancing and drinking. Then, Damon unexpectedly snaps Vicki's neck. Stefan takes Elena into the woods where his house had been and he continues telling her about his past. While he talks, we get another flashback with him, Katherine and Damon. The two brothers play football and Katherine interrupts them. She flirts with Stefan, takes the ball and runs making the two brothers chase her. At another scene, Katherine says that she needs a date for the Founder's Ball and both brothers offer themselves with pleasure(hinting the brother's future rivalry). Back in the present, Stefan tells Elena that Katherine chose him to escort her at the Founder's Ball. Damon was not mad with her choice because he does not get mad but instead gets even. Stefan tells Elena that the night he took Katherine to the Ball, Damon was also with her. Back in 1864, where Katherine and Stefan are together in bed and it is revealed that Katherine was a vampire and she bites Stefan. The next morning, Stefan is horrified but she compels him not to say anything and she tells Stefan that the three of them (her, Stefan and Damon) will always be together. Stefan tells Elena that Katherine was controlling his mind and compelled both brothers not to tell each other the secret. Vicki wakes up asking what happened. Damon tells her that she is dead since he killed her and he informs her that now she only has to feed on a human to complete the transition to become a vampire. Vicki does not believe Damon and she leaves to go to Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen). By the time she gets there, her eyes burn, the sun bothers her, she has a headache, and she is hungry. Jeremy thinks she is high and because of her strange behavior, he calls Matt (Zach Roerig). Matt gets there but he cannot do much to help Vicki when Stefan and Elena arrive. Stefan realizes what is happening and he compels Vicki to calm down and tells her that everything will be fine. He then explains to Elena and tells her that Vicki has to feed on human blood otherwise she will die. Jeremy and Vicki are alone in his room but she runs away when she feels the need to bite him. Stefan says he can track her and leaves to find her. When it gets dark, Damon leaves the house and goes to Elena's house. He sees that she is afraid of him and he figures out that Stefan told her about them being vampires. He reassures her that he is not there to hurt her but he is looking for Stefan. Since Stefan is not there, he leaves asking Elena to tell Stefan that he is looking for him in case she sees him. Meanwhile, Logan uses the Gilbert watch as a compass searching for something. Stefan finds Vicki crying. She starts remembering things and now she knows what is happening to her. Stefan promises that he can help her but Logan arrives and shoots him with wooden bullets. Logan is about to stake Stefan but Vicki pushes him away and Damon gets there and kills Logan. He then takes the bullet out of Stefan and he notices that it is wooden and realizes that people know about them. He takes his ring back and Vicki feeds on Logan, completing the transition. Stefan returns to Elena, explains what happened and he apologizes for not being able to save Vicky. Elena promises that she will not tell anyone about him being a vampire but not wanting to deal with the drama, she breaks up with him and the episode ends with her crying inside her house.

In grammar it is used at the beginning or middle of a sentence as a nominative or attributive pronoun, combined with or without ya, adds emphasis to other nouns, propositions etc.; and means - this, here or yonder, present or seen nearby, fit for, or without reference to noun refers to ‡§è‡§§‡§¶‡•ç ('that') or to what precedes. Overview In the Bhagavad Gita (Sloka XVI.13), in the phrase ‚Äì ‡§á‡§¶‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§Ö‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•Ä‡§¶‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§Ö‡§™‡§ø ‡§Æ‡•á the word, idam, has been used to mean 'this', \\"this it is, this also mine\\", and in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (Stanza I.i.10) in the phrase ‚Äì ‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§™‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§è‡§§‡•á‡§∑‡§æ‡§Ç, meaning \\"sufficient though that of these\\", idam used as ‡§è‡§§‡§¶‡•ç refers to 'that', whereas (in Stanza. II.5.9) in the phrase ‚Äì ‡§Ö‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§®‡§Ø‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§®‡•Å‡§É, meaning \\"Thunder is Vayu\\", ayam refers to 'is'. In the phrase ‚Äì ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§á‡§¶‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ç, which means - \\"Brahman possessing all the qualities is all-pervading\\", the word idam is used in the sense of 'it is', the Atman is identified with idam sarvam and the same phrase also expresses the whole world because the world springs from the Atman as is indicated in Stanza V.iii.1. In the Vedas, idam as ayam has been used as a subject in nominal sentences as an equivalent of a proposition. Connotation In Pada 32 of Book II Ch.IV of his Ashtadhyayi PƒÅ·πáini, who states that words apply per object, explains that: ‡§á‡§¶‡§Æ‡•ã‡§Ω‡§®‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂‡•á‡§Ω‡§∂‡§®‡•Å‡§¶‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§§ ‡§§‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶‡•å  in the room of idam 'this', in case of its re-employment in a subsequent member of the same sentence and referring to the same thing (anvadesha i.e. adesha after re-employment) there is the substitution of as‚Äô which is a anudatta i.e. gravely accented, when the third case-affix and the rest follow. That means ‚Äì ‡§Ö replaces ‡§á‡§¶‡§Æ‡•ç in all cases except the nominative and the accusative. In this context Katayayana stipulates that one should specify a pronominal used in subsequently referring to something should be co-referential with a previously used term because replacement by an anaphoric pronoun should not possibly be allowed where there is not co-reference. And, with regard to taddhita affixation abstract patterns like tasya idam ('prescribing a genitive relationship'), tad asmin ('prescribing a locative relationship') and tat karoti ('prescribing an action meaning involving an accusative relationship') have been identified. The genitive form of idams is explained as a sthaneyoga sasthi (Pada I.i.49) and the locative form is explained as parasaptami when a case ending beginning with the instrumental case endings follows. A substitute which has s‚Äô as an it-letter replaces the whole of the original form which step requires an anubandha. Kaiyata tells us that words with Krta and Tadditha affixes denoting bhava ('being') extended for bhava to mean dravya ('object') would result in dravya, a pronoun, referring to anything not specified i.e. to an individual object or locus. According to Patanjali the verb as‚Äô means - bhava or kriya. The term, Kriyadharma ('the properties of an action'), is also used in contrast with the terms dravyadharma and sattvadharma; and Helaraja states that which has the latter two is something that can be referred to by demonstratives such as idam ('this') and tad ('that'). In Pali language, Ida and Idam are accusative singular neuters as is the original etad or eghad. In Tamil literature idam refers to land, landscape or place, which word is one of the six forming the three sets of oppositions; idam pairs in opposition with kalam ('time') i.e. idavakupeyar that gives name to a place or to something in or from that place, and kalavakupeyar which applies the name of a time or season to something that occurs in time and season. Minard (according to whose criteria repetition would imply an adverb and a declined form indicates a pronoun) considers idam in the phrase idam sarvam as an adverb but idam of the Shatapatha Brahmana ( Stanza 7.4.1.25) firstly implies the article and thereafter 'the All', the Absolute totality which removes the anti-thesis of ayam ('this') and asau ('yonder world'). Madhvacharya consistent with Samkhya philosophy and Sayana with Advaita Vedanta, take idam occurring in the first line ‚Äì ‡§® ‡§µ‡§ø ‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø ‡§Ø‡§¶‡§ø‡§µ‡•á‡§¶‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ø ‡§®‡§ø‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§É ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§®‡§ß‡•ç‡§¶‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§®‡§∏‡§æ ‡§ö‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø in Mantra I.164.37 of the Rig Veda to mean 'the Universe' instead of its adverbial meaning \\"here\\", where the word samnaddho means ignorance rather than scepticism. Vedic elucidation The Bhagavad Gita‚Äôs and the post-Vedic use of idam and tad refers to the Absolute or Brahman or \\"the All\\" i.e. to that which the Vedic sages sought to clarify. The idam occurring in the beginning of Rig Veda mantra X.135.7 refers to the seat of Yama where is heard the sound of Yama‚Äôs flute which no mortal can resist. Idam is the nominative singular neuter demonstrative pronouns, Being and Non-being the singular subject which is one without a second, in which condition it applies to anything falling within the range of human experience. Advaita elucidation According to Sankara, aham (I-sense secured in introspection, visayi) and idam (thou-sense sense secured in extrospection, visaya) are polarly related, they are as opposed as light and darkness. Idam Brahman refers to etadakshara - Brahman as the objective unity and the tadakshara ‚Äì Brahman refers to the subject, the Atman i.e. Brahman as Itself, which cannot be an object matter of pramana-jnana since the Atman is non-dual and does not have the knowing and the known in it. Reality is to be cognized objectively as an idam as the goal by looking inwards otherwise the vidhi-vakyas would serve no purpose. Beyond \\"I\\" is not any person knower or doer but the transcendental ground of \\"I\\", the unspeakable; the indeterminate cannot be spoken about directly. Sankara condemns avidya or Adhyasa, the wrong apprehension of a content where it is not nor can ever be, which the true knowledge of idam or Brahman alone can eradicate. The idam aspect of ahamkara reflected by the light of the pure self becomes the object of the \\"I-sense\\". Brahman cannot be known in the objective attitude as an object somewhere in the beyond as an idam. Advaita Vedanta holds Brahman as the Atman and Brahman as idam sarvam (\\"all this\\"). Yoga and Shaivite elucidation The Yoga school of Hindu philosophy considers the Individual Self inseparable from and identical with the Universal Self. Shiva represents the supreme consciousness Brahman; the subject (consciousness) which is the positive Shiva-tattva is called aham and the object ('power of consciousness') which is the negative Shakti-tattva is called idam('this'), the former which pervades the thirty-five tattvas being passive is dependent on Shakti (idam) for creation to occur. The three principal modes of Shakti are iccha-shakti ('will power'), jnana-shakti ('power of knowledge') and kriya-shakti ('power of action'). Sadashiva-tattva, which is the first thing with a cause, identified with iccha-shakti consists of both aham, and idam, Ishvara-tattva identified with jnana-shakti accounts for aham recognizing idam, and Sadvidya- tattva identified with kriya-shakti is the complete \\"subject-object unity\\". In Cit-shakti, Ananda-shakti, Iccha-shakti, Jnana-shakti and Kriya-shakti the svatantraya of Shiva is reflected. Shakti-tattva too is a reflection of Shiva- shakti. The four tattvas are not created by the energies of Shiva but are an expression or ushma (\\"heat\\") of His true nature. Suddhavidya is the real state of Shiva or the state of aham aham-idam ida, Ishvara which is the state of idam-aham, Sadashiva is the state of aham-idam and Shakti is the state of aham. In the first section of aham aham-idam idam, aham aham signifies the stable state associated with one‚Äôs cognition of the real nature of Self, the truth of this universe, and the second section idam idam signifies the unstable state when one experiences the universe is false and unreal. The fourth energy called the pralayakala pramatri shakti makes one reside in the state of Suddhavidya. Shaivism defines sristi (\\"Creation\\") as the act of the Supreme Lord making idam ('object') appear through self-manifestation in the back-ground of akasha (void or space) created by self-limitation or self- negation. Here Idam signifies the Anatman which Idamta though not different from Ahamta is not eternal; the self-experience of Ahamta prevails over the self-experience of indistinct Idamta which disappears on attaining the stithi state ‚Äì aham eva idam (\\"I am all this\\"). Idamta, a self-extension, aids in the realization of Paramshiva.

She supported and participated in the culture policy of her spouse. She had books printed in Romanian, Greek, Slavic, Arabic, Turkic and Georgian, and founded libraries with Western books. She is especially known for her support to the St. Sava convent. After the deposition of her spouse in 1714, she was brought as a prisoner to Constantinople by the Ottoman along with the rest of her family. Her spouse, her four sons and her son-in- law were executed in the presence of the Sultan Ahmed III and the ambassadors of Sweden, France, Venice and Russia in Istanbul on her husband's birthday. She was eventually released, and exiled to Kutai, near the eastern shore of the Black Sea. She was allowed to return to Bucharest in 1716, by her relative, the Prince Nicolae Mavrocordat. In 1720, she managed to have the supposed remains of her spouse brought back to Wallachia and buried them in Sf Gheorghe church, founded by her husband, in Bucharest. It is highly improbable that the remains (a skull and some bones), which she bought from Greek monks of the Kamariotitsa monastery, belong to the decapitated Prince, as the heads were exposed for two weeks on the Imperial Gate in Istanbul and the bodies were thrown in the Bosforus, immediately after the executions. After the return to Wallachia, Maria Brancoveanu experienced a tense time, under the pressure of her rapacious daughters ans venal sons in law, for the heritage of Constantin Brancoveanu. The place of her grave is unknown. The presumed places are Sf Gheorghe Church in Bukarest, Church Dintr-o Zi and the Church in her native Petresti have been infirmed by archeological research.

Hollyfield earned player of year honors playing high school basketball in California before playing one year in junior college, where he earned all- state honors. He transferred to UCLA, where he was a starter in his third and final season. From his junior year in high school through his final season at UCLA, Hollyfield's teams lost just one game while winning championships in each of his six seasons. In 1973 he was drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) but never played for them. Instead he went overseas, playing during the 1975-76 season for ADB Koblenz in the German Basketball Bundesliga. High school career Hollyfield attended Compton High School, where his teams lost only three times in his career. He won championships in each of his final two years with a combined record of 66‚Äì0. In his senior year as a forward, he averaged 18.8 points in 30 games with a field goal percentage of 56 percent, and the Helms Athletic Foundation unanimously named him the 1969 California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Player of the Year. College career Hollyfield played one season at Compton Junior College (later known as El Camino College Compton Center), where he averaged 22 points and was named to the all-state team. The team went undefeated at 33‚Äì0, and won the state title. He then transferred to UCLA for their 1970‚Äì71 season, when they won a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I championship. Although he received minimal playing time during the regular season, he was ineligible for the postseason due to NCAA restrictions on junior college transfers.

Hollyfield finished his UCLA career with a championship in each of his three seasons. Since his junior year in high school, his teams had a combined record of 184‚Äì1 with championships in each of the six seasons. Post-college years Hollyfield was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers in the seventh round of the 1973 NBA Draft with the 105th overall pick, but he never played professionally. Bibby called Hollyfield \\"one of best players to go through UCLA and not make pros.\\" According to his former teammate, Hollyfield played behind many great players at UCLA, but \\"he could have been an All-American on many other teams.\\" When he was 32, he received a prosthetic left leg after a circulation problem in his left foot required amputation.

While working as a post doctoral fellow at the University of Manitoba, he was sent to Chicago to present a paper at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society in 1970. In the Press Room of the conference, he had a chance meeting with the science reporter of the wire service, Associated Press, Charles Gene McDaniels who was covering the event. When Jayaraman shared his interest in Journalism, McDaniels advised him to join the Medill School of Journalism of the Northwestern University. ‚ÄúNot many have come to us after a Ph.D. in physics.

The Ampo Lutheran Church was built in 1937 and later used as a WW2 field hospital and remains the oldest building in Lae. Several Lutheran churches, schools and headquarter buildings now occupy the surrounds. In the 1920s, the Lutheran Church had a significant impact on the Butibum and Malahang communities and garnered a great deal of loyalty to the faith. By way of example, in 1971, the Roman Catholic mission decided to erect a church in the Bumbu settlement to serve the Sepik community there. The Butibum people generally regarded this move as sacrilege because they believed their lands, on which the new church stands, are hallowed by the Lutheran faith. WW2 Under Japanese occupation many Butibam villages resisted the occupation. A villager called Kamakang received beatings from Japanese soldiers for aiding the allied coastwatchers.Scarr, Deryck 2001 A History of the Pacific Islands: Passages Through Tropical Time When Lae fell to the Allies, the Japanese had two possible routes by which to reach Madang, their base on the north coast. One was to go through the Markham Valley, where it would have been easy for the Allies to attack them from the air. This meant the Japanese had to take to the interior, through the rugged Saruwaged and Finisterre Ranges, to reach Madang. The Japanese left Butibum and followed the Busu River over the Saruwaged, to eventually reach Kiari in Sio on the north coast.Remembering the war in New Guinea Ammak Tapduk Gravel supplies In December 2012, landowners from the six clans of Butibam village signed an agreement to work together with their company, Butibum Progress Ltd, in a multi-million kina contract to supply gravel to the Lae Port Tidal Basin Project.MALUM NALU accessed 29 January 2014 Notable people * Pobuc Jonathan * Major Bill Mollard ‚Äì worked in Lae in the pre-war years with Vacuum Oil Company (Mobil), he was known to the local Butibum villagers as ‚Äòmasta Benzine.

History The first instance of foreign aid by China to Africa was in 1956 during the Suez Crisis when China gave CHF 20 million to Egypt. From 1970 and 1975, China helped finance and build the TAZARA Railway in East Africa, which remains the country's single- largest foreign aid project. Administration and budget The Department of Foreign Aid of the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) is responsible for administrating the foreign aid program. It does so in coordination with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The portfolio of the Department of Foreign Aid includes grants, zero-interest loans, the youth volunteer program, and technical assistance. The grants and interest free loans originate from the national budget. The concessional loan program originates from the Export Import Bank of China but is managed under the direction of the Department of Foreign Aid. In addition, the Department of Foreign Aid provides subsidies from the national budget covers the concessional component of loans. Chinese foreign aid is thought to be unpopular domestically due to the common belief that the largesse is required more urgently at home. Due to the secrecy of China's aid programme details (of how much is given, to whom and for what) are difficult to ascertain. A RAND published study on \\"China's Foreign Aid and Government Sponsored Investment\\" estimates the amount of both traditional aid and much more broadly defined government sponsored investment that was pledged by China in 2011 was 189.3 billion US dollars. According to a 2017 study, described as ‚ÄúThe most detailed study so far of Chinese aid,‚Äù by AidData, between 2000 and 2014 China gave about $75 billion, and lent about $275 billion ‚Äî compared to $424 billion given by America during the same period. A fifth of this Chinese aid, $75 billion, was in the form of grants (about equivalent to Britain's), while the rest was concessional lending at below- market interest rates. Forms of aid and recipients Official sources divide aid into three categories: grants, interest free loans, and concessional loans. Deborah Brautigam identifies in her book The Dragon's Gift nine types of aid from China including \\"medical teams, training and scholarships, humanitarian aid, youth volunteers, debt relief, budget support, turn-key or ‚Äòcomplete plant‚Äô projects [infrastructure, factories], aid-in-kind and technical assistance.\\" Grants or non-interest loans have funded 2,025 complete infrastructure project, from the start of aid efforts up to 2009, in the categories of farming, water distribution, conference buildings, education facilities, power supply, transport, industrial facilities, and other projects. Perhaps the famous type of project is a football stadium, which has been referred to as stadium diplomacy. A similar type of project that receives attention is the construction of theatres and opera houses. There is an African focus with about 45% of aid going to African countries in 2009.

By 1830 Richardson owned 141 S&DR; shares; Richardson was also director of companies such as the Middlesbrough and Redcar and Wear Valley Railway, which were formed to expand the S&DR.; Soon after opening the export of coal had become the S&DR; main business, but the facilities at the port in Stockton proved inadequate.

Before May 1929 Richardson had bought near Port Darlington from William Chilton of Billingham, and with Joseph and Edward Pease and others he formed the Owners of the Middlesbrough Estate to develop it. Middlesbrough had only a few houses before the coming of the railway, but a year later had a population of over 2,000 and at the 2011 census had over 138,000 people.

As reported by Evliya √áelebi, her mother was the sister of Koca Dervish Mehmed Pasha who was the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire from 1653 to 1654, and her sister was married to Islam III Giray, Khan of Crimea (1644‚Äì1654). She played a major role on personal and political decisions of her husband and son ≈ûtefƒÉni≈£ƒÉ Lupu. Well known for her philanthropic activities,Iftimi, Sorin. \\"MƒÉnƒÉstirea Golia din Ia≈üi ‚Äì o privire retrospectivƒÉ.\\" Doamna Ecaterina Cercheza became patron of the Moldavian monasteries and churches. She developed a strong reputation for her diplomatic and negotiating skills in time of crisis, in the absence of her husband and son. In his work The Return 1639, the Italian traveller Niccol√≤ Barsi da Lucca illustrates in details the journey of Doamna Ecaterina whom he describes as having \\"all the attributes of Aphroditic beauty that a woman can ever have\\".http://www.moldovenii.md/md/people/742 The historian and Prime Minister of Romania (1931‚Äì1932) Nicolae Iorga also states that \\"the Princess [Ecaterina], a Circassian by birth, was extraordinarily beautiful\\" and highly appreciated all over Moldavia. Marriage to Vasile Lupu Originating from a wealthy Circassian family in the Caucasus, Ecaterina (born circa 1620) was brought to Moldavia in 1639 to marry Vasile Lupu who, upon the death of his first wife Doamna Tudosca (1600 ‚Äì May 1639), immediately sent Ambassador Nicolae Catargie to look through the entire Circassian land for a new wife. Catargie paid 1500 ducats as dowry to Ecaterina's parents before taking her to Crimea. On 19 August 1639, they left Bakhchysarai to go to the fortress Ochakov. With the permission of Bahadƒ±r I Giray who received 1000 ducats, hundreds of Tatar and Moldavian guards accompanied the Circassian Princess to the Moldavian border. Although the journey was later interrupted by Nasuh Hussein Pasha, Beylerbey of Silistra (1638‚Äì1640), the conflict was resolved with Pasha receiving 2000 ducats. The delegation was met by a special escort even at the border crossing in Moldavia, which consisted of boyars and senior government military officials since the hospitality of foreign guests represented a particular ritual for them. On 28 September 1639, Ecaterina has finally arrived in the capital. On the entrance in Ia≈üi they were met by Vasile Rupu himself. For the arrival of the luxury-lover ruler's bride, money was not saved and Ecaterina has been honored with numerous pre-wedding gifts in addition to the most distinguished reception. Her brother and her maid were lodged in a separate residence, especially built for them. The wedding was of major political importance. Official activities Doamna Ecaterina Cercheza undertook official engagements in Moldavia. She participated alongside Vasile Lupu at all official celebrations, including the weddings of Princess Maria and Princess Ruxandra whose fates were determined by Ecaterina herself. Doamna Ecaterina also made cash donations to the Golia and Hlincea monasteries, among others. She equipped the Golia Monastery with pews brought from Constantinople. Because of the battle for the throne between Gheorghe ≈ûtefan and Vasile Lupu, Doamna Ecaterina left her family to Kamianets-Podilskyi. During the Ottoman deposition of her spouse in 1653, she was evacuated to the city of Suceava. The historian Georg Krauss states that although she initially refused to surrender, defending Suceava during the Ottoman siege, Doamna Ecaterina was forced to capitulate and compelled to give her jewels as well as five of her most beautiful horses.http://enciclopediaromaniei.ro/wiki/Doamna_Ecaterina_Cercheza Then she was taken captive to Bistri»õa, where she was imprisoned until 1658. When her son ascended to the throne in November 1659, she accompanied him to Ia≈üi and supervised his activity. In 1661, after the death of her husband and son, Doamna Ecaterina Cercheza moved to Constantinople and spent four years in the family palace on the Bosphorus. In 1665, she returned to Moldavia. Her last attestation appears in a donation document issued on 1 March 1666. Issue The couple had three children together: ≈ûtefƒÉni≈£ƒÉ (d. 1661), Ioan (d. 1648), and Alexandru (d. 1648).

It has formula [B(NO3)4]‚àí. It can form salts with large cations such as tetramethylammonium nitratoborate, or tetraethylammonium tetranitratoborate. The ion was first discovered by C. R. Guibert, M. D. Marshall in 1966 after failed attempts to make neutral (non-ionic) boron nitrate. The related molecule, boron nitrate B(NO3)3, has resisted attempts to make it, and if it exists it is unstable above ‚àí78 ¬∞C. Other related ions are the slightly more stable tetraperchloratoborates, with perchlorate groups instead of nitrate, and tetranitratoaluminate with the next atom down the periodic table, aluminium instead of boron ([Al(NO3)4]‚àí). Formation  Tetramethylammonium chloride reacts with BCl3 to make (CH3)4NBCl4. Then the tetrachloroborate is reacted with N2O4 at around ‚àí20 ¬∞C to form tetramethylammonium nitratoborate, and other gases such as NO2Cl and Cl2. Another mechanism to make tetranitratoborate salts is to shake a metal nitrate with BCl3 in chloroform at 20 ¬∞C for several days. Chloronitratoborate [Cl3BNO3]‚àí is an unstable intermediate. :MNO3 \\\\+ BCl3 ‚Üí M[Cl3BNO3] :4M[Cl3BNO3] ‚Üí 3M[BCl4] + MB(NO3)4] Properties The infrared spectrum of tetramethylammonium nitratoborate includes a prominent line at 1,612 cm‚àí1 with shoulders at 1582 and 1,626 cm‚àí1 attributed to v4. Also prominent is 1,297 and 1,311 cm‚àí1 attributed to v1, with these vibrations due to the nitrate bonded via one oxygen. The density of tetramethylammonium nitratoborate is 1.555. It is colourless and crystalline. As tetramethylammonium nitratoborate is heated it has some sort of transition between 51 and 62 ¬∞C. It decomposes above 75 ¬∞C producing gas. Above 112 ¬∞C it is exothermic, and a solid is left if it is heated to 160 ¬∞C. Tetramethylammonium nitratoborate is insoluble in cold water but slightly soluble in hot water. It does not react with water. It also dissolves in liquid ammonia, acetonitrile, methanol, and dimethylformamide. It reacts with liquid sulfur dioxide. At room temperature tetramethylammonium nitratoborate is stable for months. It does not explode with impact. Alkali metal tetranitratoborates are unstable at room temperature and decompose. 1-Ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolimium tetranitratoborate was discovered in 2002. It is an ionic liquid that turns solid at ‚àí25 ¬∞C.

It is known as Beroea, being named after one of the ancient names of Aleppo; when the city was renamed Beroea (ŒíŒ≠œÅŒøŒπŒ±) in 301 BC by Seleucus Nicator until the Arab conquest of Syria and Aleppo in 637 AD. The seat of the bishop is the Forty Martyrs Cathedral of Aleppo. It is under the jurisdiction of the Holy See of Cilicia of the Armenian Church. History The presence of Armenians in northern Syria dates back to the 1st century BC. Under Tigranes the Great, Armenians invaded Syria and the city of Antioch was chosen as one of the four capitals of the short-lived Armenian Empire. In the Middle Ages, Armenia was conquered by the Arab Islamic Caliphate during the first half of the 7th century. Thousands of Armenians were carried into slavery by the Arab invaders to serve in other regions of the Umayyad Caliphate including the Muslim-controlled Syria.Kurkjian, Vahan M.A History of Armenia hosted by The University of Chicago. New York: Armenian General Benevolent Union of America, 1958 pp. 173-185 Another wave of Armenian migrants arrived in Cilicia and northern Syria during the 2nd half of the 11th century, when Armenia was conquered by the Seljuq Turks. Most Armenians established themselves in Cilicia where they founded the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. Many other Armenians have preferred to settle in northern Syria. Armenian quarters were formed during the 11th century in Antioch, Aleppo, Ayntab, Marash, Kilis, etc. The prelacy building in Aleppo However, the Armenian population of Syria and its surrounding areas has greatly diminished after the invasion of the Mongols under Hulagu Khan in 1260. Former Archbishop Shahan Sarkisian surrounded with school children After the decline of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia during the 14th century, a new wave of Armenian migrants from the Cilician and other towns of northern Syria arrived in Aleppo. They have gradually developed their own schools and churches to become a well-organized community during the 15th century. The Armenian Diocese of Beroea was founded in 1432 in Aleppo by the Great House of Cilicia. Hovakim of Beroea became the first bishop of Aleppo, serving as primate of the diocese between 1432 and 1442.

It is the oldest remaining portion of George Johann Hutzler's homestead, and is significant for its role in the development of prize-winning Rosen rye and Michelite seeds. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History George Johann Hutzler was born in about 1815 and lived in the small village Oberkrumbach near Kirchensittenbach, Bavaria. In 1853, he and his wife Margaretha, along with their children, emigrated for America. They arrived in early 1854, and immediately traveled to Buffalo, New York, to join Hutzler's half-brother, George Conrad Hutzler. George Johann found work as a sailor on the steamer Iowa (likely following in the footsteps of his half-brother). He soon went to work, likely part-time, for Burton, Lord & Co. on South Manitou Island, supplying wood to steamers. At some point in the late 1850s or (more likely) in 1860, George Johann Hutzler moved his wife and family from Buffalo to South Manitou Island. In 1863, Hutzler staked a claim to 160 acres of land on the island; he was the first farmer to stake a claim on the island. He grew crops on his land and eventually added animals. He constructed this barn some time between 1870 and 1880 to house swine. George Johann Hutzler died in 1890 and was buried on the farm. His son John (born on the island in 1865) took over ownership of the farm; Margaretha stayed there until 1901 when she moved to Chicago. John married Bertha Peth in 1893; the couple had one child in 1899 who died in 1901. John and Bertha soon divorced, but apparently got along amicably when living apart. In the 1920s, researchers from Michigan Agricultural College (now Michigan State University) chose South Manitou Island to work on experimental hybridization of rye plants, due primarily to its isolation from other rye crops which prevented accidental cross-pollination. Many of the island farmers, including John Hutzler, participated in experimental hybridization of crops, including prize-winning the Rosen rye and Michelite pea beans that were once significant field crops in Michigan. However, during the Great Depression, transportation on the Great Lakes declined, and South Manitou Island farmer had a more difficult time getting their crops to market; even the experimental farming that many farm families, including the Hutzlers, engaged in could not sustain the farms on the island. As a result, families began leaving in the 1940s. John Hutzler died in 1944. After his death, development groups purchased many of the farms on the island. However, development activities never materialized. In the 1970s, the National Park Service purchased the Hutzler farm (along with other South Manitou Island properties) from Martin J. McCarthy, and took over management as part of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Description Hutzler's Barn is located in a clearing along with the Hutzler farmhouse and other outbuildings in various states of repair. the barn is a 2-1/2-story frame, gable-roof swine barn, measuring by , sitting on 16-inch- square wooden beams. The upper level was used to store hay, while the lower level was used to house pigs. The walls are constructed from weathered wood with the front gable roof covered with tar paper. The interior of the barn is partitioned into three sections, each with its own entrance.

However, during the Great Depression, transportation on the Great Lakes declined, and South Manitou Island farmers had a more difficult time getting their crops to market; even the experimental farming that many farm families, including the Hutzlers, engaged in could not sustain the farms on the island. As a result, families began leaving in the 1940s. Louis Hutzler eventually married and moved to Hastings, Michigan. George Conrad Hutzler Jr. died on the farm in 1951 and is buried there. After George Conrad Hutzler Jr.'s death, a development group headed by William Boals purchased the farm from his son. They rented the farm to the Riker family. However, development activities never materialized, and in 1970 Boals sold the property to the National Park Service. The Rikers, by then the last active farm family on the island, were asked to relocate, and the farm (and other properties on South Manitou Island) were included as part of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Description Farmhouse The George Conrad Hutzler Farm is located on near the center of the island. The farm contains a house, barn, five shed, a chicken coop, and a granary surrounded by old fields. The George Conrad Hutzler house is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure with clapboard siding on a concrete foundation. The house has a gable roof covered in hexagonal slate tiles. The main section measures by , and a small shed-roof addition is built on one side. The associated barn is a gable-roofed structure on a wooden foundation. It is clad with vertical board siding and roofed with wooden shingles. It measures by and has a pair of large double wooden doors on one side. The five sheds are all gable roofed wooden structures. They are: *Two- story by structure with wooden shingles and board-and-batten siding. *One- story by structure with an asphalt roof and tarpaper siding. *One-story by structure with wooden shingles and horizontal board siding. *One-story by structure asphalt shingles and horizontal board siding. *One-story by structure with wooden shingles and horizontal board siding. The chicken coop consists of two connected structures. The larger structure measures by , with an asphalt-covered shed roof and vertical board siding on a wood foundation. The smaller part measures by , with an asphalt-covered gable roof and vertical board siding on a wood foundation. The granary is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure measuring by , with a small one-story shed attached to the rear. It has a wood foundation and is covered by a gable roof with wood shingles. A corn crib is on one side.

Their axons do not extend beyond the dorsal cochlear nucleus but synapse with other cartwheel cells and pyramidal cells within the DCN releasing GABA and glycine onto their targets. Cartwheel cells have similar spiking patterns to Purkinje cells, firing complex spike bursts as well as simple spikes.

Life He was born in Charlieu, in the Loire. In 1941, he received his doctorate from the Pontifical Gregorian University under Charles Boyer, SJ. That same year, he joined the theology faculty at Fourvi√®re, near Lyon, alongside Henri de Lubac. His doctorate was published in 1944 as Conversion et gr√¢ce chez saint Thomas d'Aquin. The book so emphasized the human role in conversion that it seemed to many neo-Thomists to call into question God's assistance in the process. In its placing of Thomas Aquinas' thought squarely within the history of the development of doctrine, it also seemed to the same neo-Thomists to relativise the theology of Thomas Aquinas, as well as human truth claims in general.Hans Boersma, Nouvelle th√©ologie and sacramental ontology, (2009), pp99-104 When de Lubac's Surnaturel was published in 1946, Bouillard's book became part of a more general debate on the position of the Fourvi√®re theologians.Hans Boersma, Nouvelle th√©ologie and sacramental ontology, (2009), p27 In 1950, Bouillard was removed from his teaching post at Fourvi√®re because of his connections to the strands of thought known as nouvelle th√©ologie. In the seven years that followed, he embarked on a large study of Karl Barth. This was written as his second dissertation, at the Sorbonne, and was defended in the presence of Barth himself.Hans Boersma, Nouvelle th√©ologie and sacramental ontology, (2009), pp104-6 He was Professor of Fundamental Theology at the Institut Catholique in Paris, and, together with Jean Dani√©lou, founded the Institut de science et th√©ologie des religions (ISTR) in 1967.

He was the first disciple according to some sources. He took his monastic vows and joined Baranagar Math to serve the other disciples of Sri Ramakrishna in 1888‚Äì89 and subsequently joined the Belur Math when it was established. He was one of the leaders of early Ramakrishna Mission in its relief work. One of his significant contributions was providing relief to the citizens of Calcutta during the plague epidemic of 1898‚Äì99. He traveled to Japan in 1903. His later days were spent in company of Sister Nivedita as her protector and guide. His notable contribution in the later part of his life was preaching the message of Swami Vivekananda, especially among youth. Early years Sharat Chandra Gupta was born in Calcutta on 6 January 1865. In 1868, his parents migrated to Jaunpur, near Varanasi. His father's name was Jadunath Gupta. Being brought up in North India, Sharat Chandra developed proficiency in the Hindi and Urdu languages, although his mother tongue was Bengali. His elder brother Adharchandra Gupta had renounced worldly life and become a monk. Sharat Chandra possessed a strong physique and a generous nature. He accepted a job with the railways and was posted as a station master in Hathras railway station. There he first met the wandering monk who would become his guru. With Swami Vivekananda Sometime in September 1888 Swami Vivekananda, then an unknown itinerant monk, was travelling from Vrindavan to Haridwar and decided to take a train from Hathras. While he was waiting for the train, the station master of Hathras, Sharat Chandra Gupta, took notice of him and invited him to his quarters. In the words of Swami Virajananda, Sharat Chandra was enchanted by Swami Vivekananda's fascinating appearance and particularly his \\"devilish eyes\\". Another account asserts that Sharat Chandra Gupta saw the monk sitting in a railway compartment and being captivated by the bright eyes of the latter, entreated him to get down and be his guest as he had dreamed of those eyes.Reminiscences of Swami Vivekananda, by Sister Christine, Advaita Ashrama, 3rd Edition, p 181 When Swami Vivekananda had asked Sharat as to what he had to offer as food to the guest, the latter replied quoting from a Persian poem, \\"Oh Beloved, you have come to my house, I shall prepare the most delicious dish for you with the flesh of my heart.\\" When Swami was about to take his leave, he initiated Sharat Chandra on the latter's request. Sharat Chanadra accompanied Swami Vivekananda in his journey and together they traveled to Rishikesh. The journey was strenuous for Sharat Chandra and at one point Swami Vivekananda carried his belongings, including his heavy boots, which Sadananda remembered throughout his life.Reminiscences of Sister Christine They had to give up the plan of further travel owing to illness and returned together to Hathras. From there Swami Vivekananda went back to Baranagar monastery and Sharat Chandra Gupta resigned and joined the monastery seven months later. This time he got the company of Swami Vivekananda for twelve months. He took his monastic vows and was named as Swami Sadananda. While Swami Vivekananda had been travelling all over India and abroad, Swami Sadananda, except for brief travels, stayed in the monastery in Calcutta. There is at least one letter addressed to Sadananda, from Ghazipur, in which Swami Vivekananda had enquired about Sadananda's spiritual practices and advised him on leading a pious life.Letter to Sadananda from Ghazipur During his stay in America, Swami Vivekananda enquired about Sadananda in some of his letters written to his brother disciples.Letter to the brother disciples in 1894 In another letter where Swami Vivekananda narrated his vision for an organization, he wanted Swami Sadananda to become the librarian of the monastery.Letters of Swami Vivekananda 1896 Swami Vivekananda returned to India in January 1897. Sadananda had gone to welcome him in Madras and was part of a vast crowd that had gathered. But his master still spotted him in the crowd and invited him to sit beside himself in the carriage. In March 1897, Swami Vivekananda sent Swami Ramakrishnananda to set up a monastery in Madras and Swami Sadananda was sent to assist him. Shortly after reaching Madras Sadananda was bitten by a dog but recovered from it.Letters of Swami Vivekananda to Swami Ramakrishnananda 1897 In 1897 Swami Sadananda joined Swami Vivekananda in his tour to Northern India. Swami Sadananda wrote an article in the issue of Brahmavadin in January 1898 describing Swami's visit to Khetri. He also traveled together with Swami Vivekananda and Sister Nivedita to Almora in 1898. With Swami Vivekananda in Kashmir. Sitting beside the Swami on the left is Sadananda Sadananda was present in Belur Math when Swami Vivekananda died on 4 July 1902. Swami Sadananda used to refer to himself as Vivekananda's dog, out of respect and love.Rarely Known Facts about Vivekananda Monastic Life Sadananda introduced the term Maharaj to address the monks which became the accepted form of address in Ramakrishna Order. Sadananda was deft in service. He served the other inmates of the monastery. He also served an ailing Balaram Bose, the direct householder disciple of Sri Ramakrishna when the latter was in his deathbed. In April 1890 Sadananda went to Benares and stayed with Swami Vivekananda in the garden house of Pramadadas Mitra, living a life of austere spiritual practices. He also nursed back an ailing Swami Abhedananda and stayed with the latter in Jhusi, near Allahabad and studied and practised Vedanta under his tutelage. In 1892 when the monastery was shifted to Alambazar and was renamed as Alambazar Math Swami Sadananda worked hard for managing the transition. During the initial days Swami Sadananda was much inconvenienced owing to his lack of knowledge in Bengali. However Swami Saradananda helped him in overcoming his troubles with the language and the rigorous disciplines of a monastic life. Owing to recurring health problems he stayed for sometime with his parents and on recovering his health returned to Alambazar Math. After Swami Vivekananda came back to India, Swami Sadananda was sent to Madras along with Swami Ramakrishnananda and they stayed in the Ice House of Biligiri. However he came back and later traveled with Swami Vivekananda to Almora, probably because he did not prefer to stay in Madras.Letter of Swami Vivekananda to Swami Ramakrishnananda July 1897 After returning to Calcutta from his Kashmir trip, Swami Vivekananda had deputed Swami Sadananda to the task of looking after Sister Nivedita. Swami Sadananda stayed in her house on Bosepara Lane in Baghbazar. According to the biographer of Sister Nivedita, this duty was entrusted upon Swami Sadananda because of his strict discipline resulting from his military background. In this account the biographer refers to Sadananda's activities as, He slept in a room which opened independently near the front entrance;he worked and ate his meals alone there;he looked after the plants;and as he worked he sang joyfully, \\"My Lord, I love thee, I adore thee.\\" In the evening he insisted that Nivedita should stop her work and come down to the courtyard and then he would tell her wonderful stories of the Ramayana. Sadananda made her aware of the customs of India through the stories of Mahabharata which he recounted to her. He was also instrumental in introducing Sister Nivedita to the general populace of Baghbazar and nearby areas, which facilitated her work and helped to gain the trust of the local people. Swami Sadananda was also present at the time of death of Swami Yogananda.Letters of Sister Nivedita Swami Vivekananda had entrusted him the responsibility of supervisor of the plague relief work which started in March 1899 in Calcutta. Swami Vivekananda had drafted a plague manifesto which Swami Sadananda and Sister Nivedita distributed to the greater part of the population of the affected city. He led a group of volunteer work, mostly youth who were inspired by the ideals of Swami Vivekananda. Swami Sadananda did not undertake any major work after Swami Vivekananda's death and remained a local guardian of Sister Nivedita and a preacher of his master's ideals especially among the youth. Character According to Life of Swami Vivekananda by His Eastern and Western Disciples, Swami Sadananda's whole character may be summed up in three words, Sweetness, Sincerity and Manliness. Another characteristic trait of Swami Sadananda was his capacity to love and serve others and to solicit love from others. Swami Sadananda was a daredevil, much in line with what Swami Vivekananda preferred his disciples to be. During his stay in Khetri with Swami Vivekananda, he mounted on an unruly horse and tamed it, which was much appreciated by Swami himself. Similarly in Almora he once rode the most spirited horse and made it submissive. Service as ideal Swami Sadananda had adopted service as the primary means of worship, as directed by his master. He started his life of service by serving the monks and brother disciples of Swami Vivekananda in Baranagar and Alambazar monastery. He helped Swami Ramakrishnananda in establishing the monastery of Ramakrishna order in Madras. His zeal to serve poor was evident in his plague relief work in Calcutta. He helped Sister Nivedita in serving Gopaler Ma, when the latter was ill. He also served Ramakrishna Mission in its plague relief work in Bhagalpur in 1904. Later Days After the demise of Swami Vivekananda, Swami Sadananda began devoting time towards preaching the former's ideals, especially among the youth. He traveled to Japan in 1903 together with Bramhachari Amulya (later Swami Shankarananda). He accompanied Sister Nivedita in some of her travels to Mumbai and South India in 1902. He helped Nivedita in running Vivekananda Students' Home for a year and took the young boys to trips to Himalayas. In 1904 he, together with Sister Nivedita, Jagadish Chandra Bose, Rabindranath Tagore, Sister Christine, Jadunath Sarkar etc. visited Bodh Gaya. Sadananda also went to Nalanda and Rajgir. Later he went to Bodh Gaya accompanying Mrs. Charlotte Sevier. In 1909 he stayed for sometime in the house of Sureswar Sen in Bishnupur, Bankura and inspired the family with the ideals of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda. The Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi also stayed several times in the house of Sureswar Sen. Sen's younger brother Basiswar Sen, a renowned scientist became a devoted follower of Swami Sadananda. Sadananda was afflicted with diabetes and also suffered from asthma. He was confined to bed for around two years. The Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi came to visit him during his illness on 25 November 1910. When Swami Sadananda was ill and was in his death bed, Basiswar Sen and his cousin nursed him diligently.Boshi Sen - A Scientist and Karma Yogi by Hironmoy Mukherjee, Bulletin of Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, 2009 Swami Sadananda died on 18 February 1911, in Calcutta. An article in Prabuddha Bharata was written as an obituary to him which stated, \\"There was no work so hard, no difficulty so insurmountable, no word of command so impracticable, that he could not carry into effect for the sake of Swami Vivekananda.\\" Contribution Swami Sadananda played an important role in the early history of the Ramakrishna movement through his twin ideals of service and renunciation. He was one of the leaders of Ramakrishna Mission in rendering service to the poor and affected in the early days. He helped Swami Ramakrishnananda in establishing the Ramakrishna Math in Madras. He played a leading role in carrying out plague relief activities in Calcutta in 1898‚Äì99. As part of his efforts to eradicate the disease he even cleaned the streets and slums along with a group of volunteers and coordinated the relief effort. He also rendered valuable service in the plague relief operations in Bhagalpur in 1904. He also helped in shaping the ideals of Sister Nivedita and in her work to promote education among Indian women by familiarizing her with the traditional customs of India, by introducing her to the local people and by bringing the first three girls who joined her school. Sister Nivedita acknowledged in her letter to Sara Bull that Swami Sadananda was her greatest strength in her dealings with children of the school. She also acknowledged in a letter that whatever success she achieved, she owed it to the inspiration and strength of Swami Sadananda. He searched for and found several poor children for Nivedita's school. Even after Sister Nivedita formally relinquished her association with Ramakrishna Order owing to her political activities, Swami Sadananda remained to take care of her. Also he took care of the students of the Vivekananda Students' Home, which Sister Nivedita had established, became the teacher and mentor of the students and took them out on field trips to Himalayas.

Production The commissioning of the series was announced by Janice Hadlow on 22 August 2013 at the Edinburgh International Television Festival under the name of Rock Ratatouille. Origins Comedian Rhys Thomas created the character of Brian Pern in 2008 when he was asked by BBC Comedy commissioner Simon Lupton to come up with an idea for the first batch of Online-Exclusive comedy sketches the BBC Comedy Website was developing. A fan of Peter Gabriel, Thomas was a frequent visitor to Gabriel's website where the singer would post a monthly video blog about his current projects. At this time other rock musicians from the same generation were doing the same, such as Brian May and Brian Eno. In the series, Pern states that he \\"invented world music\\" (a reference to WOMAD) and was \\"the first musician to use Plasticine in videos\\" (a reference to Gabriel's song \\"Sledgehammer\\"). \\"There is more than one influence in that character,\\" Gabriel told Mark Blake of Q, \\"but I am definitely one of them. I'm flattered by it.\\" Once the idea was commissioned, Thomas approached his fellow Fast Show and Down the Line collaborator Simon Day to play Brian Pern. Day was also a fan of Gabriel. Following a successful run on BBC Online, a second batch of sketches were commissioned. With a small increase in budget, extra cast members were brought in: Lucy Montgomery as Majita (who would later become Pepita in the TV series) and Paul Whitehouse as guitarist Pat Quid (Thomas later cited he got the name from Stacy Keach's character in Roadgames). The relationship between Pat and Brian is based on that of David Gilmour and Roger Waters. Thomas created the part of Brian's manager John Farrow for Michael Kitchen. Thomas had been developing a comedy drama for BBC One with Kitchen and offered him the part in the second series of online specials of Brian Pern. Thomas has stated in various interviews that John Farrow is an exaggerated version of Queen manager Jim Beach, whom Thomas had worked with for many years following his involvement with the band. Reception Reviewing the second series, Brian Pern: A Life in Rock, Michael Hogan of The Daily Telegraph believed that \\"the observational material had bite but lost its cutting edge by forcing itself into a sitcom framework.\\" Andrew Billen of The Times thought that \\"the first of this three-part returning comedy certainly had its very funny moments, but was it really necessary?\\" Ellen E. Jones of The Independent considered it to be a \\"very astute, very funny spoof of f√™ted rock'n'roll royalty, money grabbing 'creative' projects and BBC arts documentaries in general.\\" Matt Baylis of the Daily Express commented \\"there's a sense of the BBC laughing at itself so other people don't have to. I'm not sure it should get off that lightly.\\" Episode list=Series 1 - The Life of Rock with Brian PernSeries 2 - Brian Pern: A Life in RockSeries 3 - Brian Pern: 45 Years of Prog and RollA Tribute - At the BBC=ReferencesExternal links  * * Category:BBC television comedy Category:2014 British television series debuts Category:2017 British television series endings Category:2010s British comedy television series Category:Television shows set in the United Kingdom Category:English-language television shows Category:British parody television series Category:British music television shows ","title":"The Life of Rock with Brian Pern"},{"id":"41808772","text":"M Sirajul Islam was a businessman and Awami League politician.

At this stage, the family estate was approximately 6,500 acres.Monteagle Papers (p. 14), Limerick Archive, 1. The house remained the seat of the Spring Rice family for 175 years, although its surrounding estate was gradually reduced in size. In 1894, the house was used as the meeting place for the founders of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, of which Lord Monteagle was one.Donald Harman Akenson, Conor: A Biography of Conor Cruise O'Brien, Volume I, \\"Narrative\\" (McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 7 September 1994), 42. During the Irish War of Independence, Mount Trenchard was used as a safe house by IRA fighters, looked after by Hon. Mary Spring Rice. In 1944, the house was occupied by the Irish Army. In 1947, the house and estate were sold to Lady Holland, who lived there until 1953. That year, the house was again sold to the Sisters of Mercy, who opened a private school for girls. They extended the complex to include a large 1960s dormitory block, classrooms and a church.Landed Estates Database, Ireland (Mount Trenchard). Mount Trenchard was sold again in 1996 and became a centre for holistic medicine. The house is currently owned and used by the Reception and Integration Agency as an accommodation centre for asylum seekers.

The border of Granada (frontera de Granada in Spanish) was a border region that existed between the Nasrid kingdom of Granada and the kingdoms of Murcia, Ja√©n, C√≥rdoba and Seville following the integration of those former Muslim territories within the Crown of Castile in the mid-13th century. The delineation of this border region underwent several changes subsequently, but on the death of Alfonso XI in 1350, the Granadine border was fixed geographically, in general terms, until the beginning of the Granada War in the late 15th century.Garc√≠a Fern√°ndez: op.ref., p.70 This territory was also referred to as La Banda Morisca (The Moorish Strip).  Toponymy  Several modern place names survive that relate to the frontier between Granada and Christian Andalusia and the communities established on the Castilian side of the border. Thus, in the province of Cadiz there are the municipalities of Arcos de la Frontera, Castellar de la Frontera, Chiclana de la Frontera, Conil de la Frontera, Jerez de la Frontera, Jimena de la Frontera and Vejer de la Frontera; in the province of Malaga, Cortes de la Frontera; in the province of Cordoba, Aguilar de la Frontera and in the province of Sevilla, Mor√≥n de la Frontera. There are other municipalities in the Huelva province, which include \\"de la Frontera\\" in their names. However, these do not refer to the Border of Granada border, but to the border with Portugal. This is the case with Rosal de la Frontera and Palos de la Frontera.  Delineation  The first frontier was defined by the Pact of Ja√©n in 1246 between Muhammad I \\"ibn al-Ahmar\\", first king of Granada, and King Fernando III 'El Santo', following extensive conquests by the latter in the valley of the Guadalquivir. The border then went through modifications during the reigns of Sancho IV, Fernando IV and Alfonso XI. However, following the death of Alfonso XI in 1350, the border of Granada underwent a process of stabilization and delineation, which lasted until the War of Granada at the end of the 15th century. The line of the border ran from a point on the Strait of Gibraltar, between the mouths of the Rio Palmones and the Rio Guadarranque climbing northwards through the Sierra de Montecoche until it arrived at the Guadalete River. At that point, it veered eastwards, running parallel to the northern foothills of the Serran√≠a de Ronda. From the Guadalteba and Yeguas rivers, the border took a north-west direction, with some variations, running through the mountains south of Benameji, Rute, Priego de Cordoba and Alcala la Real. It continued along the valley of the Guadalbullon River up to the heights of the Sierra Magina. Continuing northeast, it skirted the foothills of Sierra de Cazorla and Sierra de Segura, entering Murcian territory,Garc√≠a Fern√°ndez: op.ref., p.71 where, in the districts of Caravaca and Lorca, a thick forest acted as a buffer zone.La frontera y el bosque en el Medievo: nuevos planteamientos para una problem√°tica antigua. Vincent Clement All the territory of Alicante and Orihuela, including the southern portion of the Kingdom of Valencia, from Alcoy and Cocentaina to the sea, formed a border area as well.  Implications  During its existence, the border had a great territorial, political, economical, religious and cultural importance. Beyond being a border like so many others, it was for more than two centuries the European boundary between Christianity and Islam. It was, therefore, a place of strong exchange that allowed for legal and illegal economic activities, like trade with Oriental products or military raids aimed at the mere pursuit of plunder, and taking of hostages to support the slave trade, or simply to negotiate the release of the captives. In this respect, religious orders took sides. The characteristics of this area caused kings to grant many rights and privileges to border towns in order to improve the attractiveness of life in those places, for even in times of peace there was a permanent risk of being caught or dying due to Grenadines frequent raids. The society of the frontier populations was characterized by isolation from other regions, derived from a position adjacent to the enemy and therefore by fundamental characteristics based on military activity, which explained the concerns of councils counting on those with the economic capacity to maintain horses and weapons, in addition the infantry formed the majority of the army, and also opportunists who arrived to smuggle goods across the other side of the border, and even those convicted of violent crimes who sought to redeem themselves and avoid punishment by serving the mighty. The settlements were established through a number of fortified cores, close together, with limited extension and a scarce density of population, and with only military functions that were above all else defensive.\\"La defensa del Reino de Murcia\\": La frontera de Granada (ss.XIII-XV). Universidad de Murcia.JOS√â MANUEL AG√úERA MONTORO The primary economic activity was ranching, due to the lack of population and, therefore, a scarcity of farmhands, in addition to the insecurity of the entire terrain. Therefore, the basic economic wealth of the frontier populations was through the activity of ranching, as livestock, especially sheep and goats that could be transported and secured behind the walls of fortresses and cities in case of a Moorish attack.TORRES FONTES, J: ‚ÄúEl campo de Lorca en la primera mitad del siglo XIV‚Äù en Miscel√°nea Medieval Murciana, 11, Universidad de Murcia, 1984, pp, 155-176 Among the main involvements, the creation of the military charge of Adelantado Mayor de la Frontera (Major Governor of the Border) stands out, which kept the spirit of Christian crusades and Islamic Jihad alive in both territories, as well as the chivalrous ideal, already anachronistic in other European territories, with a true irredentism growing from the 15th century which had as its final objective, the finalisation of the Reconquista and the recuperation of the territory which used to constitute the Visigothic Kingdom of Toledo.Castillo C√°ceres: op.ref., p.48  Border romances  In the artistic and cultural field, the border romances, moniker from Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal, may be one of the most brilliant aspects produced by this contact between civilizations. Those ballads poeticize some historical events, like the capture of significant cities of the kingdom (Antequera, √Ålora, Alhama, etc.) which constitute the prelude to the Capture of Granada. At the same time, the frontier ballads tell of other armed events that produced the frontier, like the flight and sorrows of the knights. Its origin seems to be found in the medieval chanson de geste, popularized since the 14th century by minstrels, who helped its spreading in the cities and villages of Spain.Mart√≠nez Iniesta: op.ref.: Introducci√≥n That way, the frontier was a key element in the formation of the vision of Islam in all of Spain.  The border after the Reconquista  After its conquest, the Kingdom of Granada kept its specificity, even in financial matters. For instance, the customs of the tax and partial tax on the old frontier with Andalucia and with Murcia were maintained, at least in that they took the Granadan silk.

Coached by Des Hasler and co-captained by Michael Ennis and Frank Pritchard, they competed in the National Rugby League's 2014 Telstra Premiership. Finishing the regular season 7th (out of 16), the team reached the finals for the third consecutive year. They then went on to reach the 2014 NRL Grand final, in which they were defeated by the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Pre-season In the pre-season theBulldogs competed in the 2014 NRL Auckland Nines, the first ever staging of the nine-a-side knockout tournament. Regular season The Bulldogs started the regular season with a narrow loss to the Brisbane Broncos before accounting for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in the second week of the competition. They would then go on to get beaten by the Penrith Panthers after the siren in round 3. Following this loss the Bulldogs went on a season high 7 game winning streak, during which they made history by becoming the only team to ever win 3 consecutive games by a single point, victories they earned over the Sydney Roosters, the New Zealand Warriors and the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Due to the impressive form of the team, several players were called up to play State Of Origin for New South Wales, which triggered a mid-season slump, during which the Bulldogs did not register a win for over a month. The team managed to regain some form towards the end of the origin period, claiming victories over the Canberra Raiders in round 16 and heavy favourites Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in round 17. The Bulldogs played arguably their best defensive game of the year in round 18, when they kept the Melbourne Storm to just 4 points and ran out winners by 2. What followed was an unpredictable collapse over the following four matches. Injuries and suspensions played havoc during the end of the regular season and after having such good defence all year, the bulldogs let in 123 points in just four games against the Wests Tigers, the North Queensland Cowboys, the Penrith Panthers and the Brisbane Broncos, only managing 56 in return. The Bulldogs next win came in round 23 when they accounted for the Parramatta Eels by 2 points. In round 24 the Bulldogs were able to reverse the result against the Tigers, winning 30-10 and all but assuring themselves a place in the finals. The final 2 rounds of the regular season came as losses to the South Sydney Rabbitohs, who ran away victors after trailing the Bulldogs for most of the match, and the Gold Coast Titans, who came back from an 18-0 half time deficit to win 19-18 in golden point extra time. The Bulldogs finished the regular season in Seventh place. { border=1 style=\\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:90%; text-align:center;\\" cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 width=100% - bgcolor=#C1D8FF !rowspan=2 width=3%Round !rowspan=2 width=28%Home !rowspan=2 width=5%Score !rowspan=2 width=28%Away !colspan=6Match Information - bgcolor=#EFEFEF !width=15%Date and Time !width=12%Venue !width=9%Crowd - bgcolor=#ffbbbb 1 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs 12-18 align=left  23x23px Brisbane Broncos Fri 7 Mar 2014, 8:05pm AEDT ANZ Stadium 18,040 - bgcolor=#bbffbb 2 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs 42-4 align=left  23x23px Cronulla Sharks Mon 17 Mar 2014, 7:00pm AEDT ANZ Stadium 12,057 - bgcolor=#ffbbbb 3 align=left  23x23px Penrith Panthers 18-16 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs Sat 22 Mar 2014, 4:30pm AEDT Centerbet Stadium 13,291 - bgcolor=#bbffbb 4 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs 40-12 align=left  23x23px Melbourne Storm Sat 29 Mar 2014, 4:30pm AEDT NIB Stadium 12,014 - bgcolor=#bbffbb 5 align=left  23x23px Sydney Roosters 8-9 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs Fri 4 Apr 2014, 7:40pm AEDT Sydney Football Stadium 12,854 - bgcolor=#bbffbb 6 align=left  23x23px New Zealand Warriors 20-21 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs Sun 13 Apr 2014, 4:00pm NZST Eden Park 22,165 - bgcolor=#bbffbb 7 align=left  23x23px South Sydney Rabbitohs 14-15 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs Fri 18 Apr 2014, 4:00pm AEST ANZ Stadium 43,255 - bgcolor=#bbffbb 8 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs 16-12 align=left  23x23px Newcastle Knights Sat 26 Apr 2014, 7:30pm AEST ANZ Stadium 15,286 - bgcolor=#bbffbb 9 align=left 23x23px St. George Illawarra Dragons 6-38 align=left 23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs Sun 11 May 2014, 3:00pm AEST ANZ Stadium 21,077 - bgcolor=#bbffbb 10 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs 16-12 align=left  23x23px New Zealand Warriors Sun 18 May 2014, 2:00pm NZST Waikato Stadium 17,673 - bgcolor=#ffbbbb 11 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs 12-32 align=left  23x23px Sydney Roosters Fri 23 May 2014, 7:45pm AEST ANZ Stadium 19,088 - bgcolor=#C1D8FF 12  BYE - bgcolor=#ffbbbb 13 align=left  23x23px Manly- Warringah Sea Eagles 32-10 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs Fri 6 Jun 2014, 7:40pm AEST Brookvale Oval 9,235 - bgcolor=#ffbbbb 14 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs 12-22 align=left  23x23px Parramatta Eels Sun 15 Jun 2014, 3:00pm AEST ANZ Stadium 24,012 - bgcolor=#bbffbb 15 align=left  23x23px Canberra Raiders 14-22 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs Fri 20 Jun 2014, 7:45pm AEST GIO Stadium 10,873 - bgcolor=#C1D8FF 16 align=left  BYE align=left - bgcolor=#bbffbb 17 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs 23-16 align=left  23x23px Manly Warringah Sea Eagles Fri 4 Jul 2014, 7:45pm AEST ANZ Stadium 14,921 - bgcolor=#bbffbb 18 align=left 23x23px Melbourne Storm 4-6 align=left 23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs Sat 12 Jul 2014, 7:30pm AEST AAMI Stadium 13,149 - bgcolor=#ffbbbb 19 align=left 23x23px Wests Tigers 46-18 align=left 23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs Sun 20 Jul 2014, 3:00pm AEST ANZ Stadium 22,225 - bgcolor=#ffbbbb 20 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs 12-20 align=left  23x23px North Queensland Cowboys Sat 26 Jul 2014, 7:30pm AEST ANZ Stadium 9,873 - bgcolor=#ffbbbb 21 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs 16-22 align=left  23x23px Penrith Panthers Fri 1 Aug 2014, 7:45pm AEST ANZ Stadium 11,382 - bgcolor=#ffbbbb 22 align=left  23x23px Brisbane Broncos 41-10 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs Fri 8 Aug 2014, 7:45pm AEST Suncorp Stadium 28,334 - bgcolor=#bbffbb 23 align=left  23x23px Parramatta Eels 16-18 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs Fri 15 Aug 2014, 7:45pm AEST ANZ Stadium 30,394 - bgcolor=#bbffbb 24 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs 30-10 align=left 23x23px Wests Tigers Thu 21 Aug 2014, 7:45pm ANZ Stadium 9,877 - bgcolor=#ffbbbb 25 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs 14-21 align=left  23x23px South Sydney Rabbitohs Thu 28 Aug 2014, 7:45pm AEST ANZ Stadium 20,424 - bgcolor=#ffbbbb 26 align=left  23x23px Gold Coast Titans 19-18 align=left  23x23px Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs Sun 7 Sep 2014,3:00pm AEST Robina Stadium 12,563 } Finals In week one of the finals the Bulldogs travelled to Melbourne to face the Melbourne Storm in an elimination final. For the second time in one year the Bulldogs were able to account for the Storm in their own backyard. The Bulldogs started with a bang and ran up a 24-0 half time lead, the storm managed to stop the flow of points in the second half, but were ultimately eliminated, losing 28-4. The following week they faced the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in a semi-final that went into golden point extra time. In a fiery affair that saw one player from each team spend 10 minutes in the sin bin at different times of the game, the Bulldogs raced out to an early 16-0 lead before conceding a try on halftime, leaving the half time score at 16-6. In the second half Manly managed to draw level at 16-16 and looked to have the momentum to win the game. With less than 10 minutes remaining in normal time, Trent Hodkinson kicked a field goal to give the Bulldogs a 17-16 lead. However Manly hit back with a field goal of their own and the scores were locked at 17-17 after 80 minutes. Each team had one shot at field goal in the opening minutes of extra time with no success, until 4 minutes in Hodkinson nailed his second field goal of the night to win the match 18-17, eliminating Manly and securing a Preliminary Final against the Penrith Panthers. In week three of the finals the Bulldogs and the Panthers met in a Grand Final qualifier to see who would face the South Sydney Rabbitohs the following week. The Bulldogs entered the game as favourites and scored twice in the opening half an hour to set up an early 12-0 lead. The Panthers hit back on half time and the teams headed into the break at 12-6. Moments before half time Michael Ennis the Bulldogs on field captain suffered what was later found out to be a double fracture in his foot and he did not return in the second half. With the captain and hooker off the field the Bulldog's attack was hampered in the second half, but their desperation in defence remained. Defying the odds the Bulldogs, without the direction of their captain, were next to score in the 57th minute to extend their lead to 18-6. The Panthers fought bravely and were able to score in the 72nd minute, reducing the deficit to one converted try. The game went down to the wire with the Bulldogs penalised as the full-time siren sounded, handing Penrith one final opportunity to level the scores. The play did not work however and in eerily similar circumstances to 2004 the Bulldogs defeated the Panthers without the services of their captain in the second half to secure a grand final birth. The Bulldogs faced the South Sydney Rabbitohs in the 2014 NRL Grand Final on 5 October and were defeated 30-6. { border=1 style=\\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:90%; text-align:center;\\" cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 width=100% - bgcolor=#C1D8FF !rowspan=2 width=3%Round !rowspan=2 width=28%Home !rowspan=2 width=5%Score !rowspan=2 width=28%Away !colspan=6Match Information - bgcolor=#EFEFEF !width=15%Date and Time !width=12%Venue !width=9%Crowd - bgcolor=#ffbbbb - bgcolor=#bbffbb ELIM FINAL align=left  23x23px Melbourne Storm 4-28 align=left  23x23px Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs Sun 14 Sep 2014, 4:10pm AEST AAMI Stadium 19,230 - bgcolor=#bbffbb SEMI FINAL align=left  23x23px Manly Warringah Sea Eagles 17-18 align=left  23x23px Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs Sat 20 Sep 2014, 7:45pm AEST Sydney Football Stadium 28,186 - bgcolor=#bbffbb PRELIM FINAL align=left  23x23px Penrith Panthers 12-18 align=left  23x23px Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs Sat 27 Sep 2014, 7:55pm AEST ANZ Stadium 46,168 - bgcolor=#ffbbbb GRAND FINAL align=left  23x23px South Sydney Rabbitohs 30-6 align=left  23x23px Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs Sun 5 Oct 2014, 7:20pm AEDT ANZ Stadium 83,833 } ReferencesSee also List of Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs seasons Category:Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs seasons Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs season ","title":"2014 Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs season"},{"id":"41809064","text":"Carl Township may refer to the following townships in the United States: * Carl Township, Adams County, Iowa * Carl Township, McPherson County, South Dakota ","title":"Carl Township"},{"id":"41809065","text":"Gallant Lady is a 1942 American drama film directed by William Beaudine.

The Royal Navy took her into service under her existing name and she participated in some notable engagements on the Jamaica station before the Navy sold her in 1809. Capture Cerberus was on the Irish station when on 12 and 14 November 1797 she captured two French privateers, the Epervier and the Renard. Both vessels were pierced for 20 guns, were copper-bottomed, quite new, and fast sailers. Renard carried eighteen 6-pounders and had a crew of 189 men. Lloyd's List reported Cerberuss capture of two privateers, one of 30 guns and one of 18, and the arrival of both at Cork.Lloyd's List, no.2971, - accessed 31 January 2014. The Royal Navy took both into service, though it never actually commissioned , which was frequently listed as Epervoir. Career Renard arrived in Plymouth on 12 January 1799. She sat there for six months, finally undergoing fitting between July 1799 and January 1800. While undergoing fitting she may have received additional cannons and extensive upperworks to hold them. There is some question though whether she in fact received the additional armament and upperworks (see below). Commander Peter Spicer commissioned Renard in August 1799 for the Channel. Renard shared in the recapture of the brig Defiance on 13 December 1800 with Suffisante, , and the hired armed cutter Swift (2). Twelve days later, Renard and Spitfire captured the Danish galliot Palmboom (or Palm Baum). Then on 29 December Renard captured Neptunus. In April 1801 Commander James A. Worth replaced Spicer. Renard, , and Suffisante were in company for the recapture of the brig William on 3 April 1801. On 1 April a French privateer Renard had captured William, Wedland, master, which had been sailing from Bristol to Newfoundland. Dasher sent William into Plymouth.Lloyd's List, #4141, - accessed 31 January 2014. Also on 3 April, Renard, Suffisante, and shared in the recapture of the brig Swan. Renard and Spitfire shared in the capture on 24 April of Prince Hendrich. The next day they captured Prince Frederick Van Prussia. In May 1802 Commander Charles M. Gregory assumed command, and that same month sailed Renard for the Leeward Islands. Commander Robert Pearson replaced Gregory, only to be himself replaced in October by Commander William Cathcart. Reports in Lloyd's List of ship arrivals and departures make it clear that between 1803 and 1804 Renard convoyed vessels between Britain and the Leeward Islands. Cathcart received promotion to post captain in June 1804 and with it command of Clorinde, however he died of yellow fever before fully taking command. His replacement on Renard was Commander Jeremiah Coghlan. On 20 March 1805 Renard was at when she sighted a ship to the north-west. Renard gave chase and as she approached, her quarry shortened sail and made ready to engage. At 2:20 p.m., Renard opened fire. After 35 minutes, the French vessel appeared to be on fire, and ten minutes later she exploded. Renard lowered a boat and was able to rescue 55 men, all the rest of the 160 men aboard having perished. She had been under the command of Paul Gerard Pointe, and was seven days out of Basseterre. She had intended to intercept the homeward-bound Jamaica fleet. The survivors reported that their vessel was the G√©n√©ral Ernouf. G√©n√©ral Ernouf was the former HMS Lily. Prior to the explosion, G√©n√©ral Ernouf had 20-30 men killed and wounded; Renard had only nine wounded. Earlier, Renard captured Eugene, which had been sailing from Bordeaux to New Orleans, and sent her into Jamaica.Lloyd's List, No. 4210, - accessed 1 February 2014. On 11 October, Renard, after a long chase and some firing, captured the French privateer schooner Bellona (or Bellone) on the north side of San Domingo. Bellona was armed with four guns and had a crew of 50 men. She was seven days out of Barracona and had taken an American brig. Coghlan reported that Bellona was only four months old and was considered the fastest sailer out of Cuba. It is possible that this Bellona was the vessel that captured the American schooner Hiram, of New York, Fusson, master, that recaptured.The Balance and Columbian Repository (1806), Vol. 5, No. 1, p.7. A French privateer captured, on 21 February 1806, the sloop James and the schooner Betsey, both of which were sailing from Calabash Bay to Kingston. The privateer also captured Hard Times, Banee, master, which was sailing from Black River to Kingston. Renard recaptured all three.Lloyd's List, No. 4049, - accessed 1 February 2014. On 28 May 1806 Renard captured the French navy brig Diligent (or Diligente), after a 64-hour-long chase. French records report that the capture took place in the Puerto Rico channel. She had sailed from Concarneau to Cayenne, and was cruising in the Antilles prior to her capture by the English sloop \\"Fox\\".Fonds Marine, 1805‚Äì1826, p.351. Diligent, under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Vincent Th√©venard, was armed with fourteen 6-pounders and two 32-pounder brass carronades, and carried a crew of 125 men. She was seven days out of Pointe a Petre, Guadeloupe, with dispatches for France that she succeeded in throwing overboard while Renard was chasing her. She was coppered and copper fastened, and Coghlan believed only three years old. Diligente arrived at Jamaica on 3 June.Lloyd's List, no. 4066, - accessed 1 February 2014. Vice-Admiral Dacres had her purchased and commissioned as . Th√©venard had surrendered his ship without a shot being fired by either side. When taken on board Renard, her smallness surprised him and he requested to return to his ship to continue the fight. Coghlan naturally laughed at this request. Th√©venard then asked that Coghlan award him a certificate stating that he had not acted in a cowardly manner. Coghlan replied \\"No, I cannot do that; but I will give you one that shall specify you have acted 'prudently'!\\" In July or August 1807 Coghlan transferred to . It is not clear who replaced him as commander of Renard. On 1 October 1807 Renard captured the Danish vessel Peder and Anna. Within five days the sloop-of-war Renard had arrived at Deal, together with three other vessels, all four coming from Honduras.Lloyd's List, no.4193 - accessed 1 February 2014. Fate In December 1808 the Commissioners of the Navy offered \\"His Majesty's sloops ...Renard...\\" for sale at Sheerness.

It is named after Abbess Mathilde (died in 1011) who is depicted as the donor on a cloisonn√© enamel plaque on the cross's stem. It was made between about 1000, when Mathilde was abbess, and 1058, when Abbess Theophanu died; both were princesses of the Ottonian dynasty. It may have been completed in stages, and the corpus, the body of the crucified Christ, may be a still later replacement. The cross, which is also called the \\"second cross of Mathilde\\", forms part of a group along with the Cross of Otto and Mathilde or \\"first cross of Mathilde\\" from late in the preceding century, a third cross, sometimes called the Senkschmelz Cross, and the Cross of Theophanu from her period as abbess. All were made for Essen Abbey, now Essen Cathedral, and are kept in Essen Cathedral Treasury, where this cross is inventory number 4.  Description  The reverse of the Cross of Mathilde The Cross of Mathilde is tall and wide and the cross beams are wide and deep. It consists of an oak core covered in gold sheet. Under the cross is a modern glass ball which serves as a handle. The ends of the Latin cross are flared in a way found in Mathilde's First Cross and the Ottonian Cross of Lothair at Aachen. The narrow sides and reverse of the Cross of Mathilde are covered with gilt copper. On the reverse it is decorated with a punchmarked Agnus Dei which is accompanied by the four Evangelists' symbols. On the obverse there is a crucifix cast in bronze The view that it is silver, often encountered in the literature, is faulty: Pawlik, Heilige, Reliquien und Reliquiare im Essener Stift ‚Äì ein Inventar, p. 286 n. 71. and gilt, with three cavities for holding relics: two in the back and one in the occiput. To the left and right of the crucifix there are enamel roundels with personifications of the Sun and the Moon, surrounded by four pearls each and by filigreework. Above the crucifix is the normal cross inscription in enamel: IHC NAZA/RENVS REX / IVDEORV (Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews), above which there is a large red stone surrounded by four pearls. Under the crucifix there is a brown cameo gem of a lion and under that there is an enamel plate with the donor portrait which depicts Mathilde (named) in monastic clothing, kneeling in prayer before the Madonna. The central area with the crucifix, donor portrait, cross inscription, sun, moon and lion cameo is bordered by a strip of alternating enamel plates and stones, each surrounded by four pearls. At the end of each cross beam there are four teardrop-shaped, coloured stones around a central stone. On the right arm, the central stone is a cameo with a female bust looking left. On the left arm it is an intaglio cut in a piece of striped onyx, showing a helmeted soldier in profile, holding a spear. The Cross of Mathilde is generally considered the weakest of the four Essen processional crosses in artistic terms,Eckenfels-Kunst, Goldemails. Untersuchungen zu ottonischen und fr√ºhsalischen Goldzellenschmelzen, p. 64. Pothmann considers the artistry and craftsmanship to be not as high as the others.Pothmann, Der Essener Kirchenschatz aus der Fr√ºhzeit der Stiftsgeschichte, p. 147. In 1904, Humann described it as a \\"cluttered grandeur and, every respect, a cruder image.\\"Humann, Die Kunstwerke der M√ºnsterkirche zu Essen, p. 145. The assessment of the cross is significantly complicated by an undocumented restoration which must have occurred between 1904 and 1950. In this restoration the edging enamels were melted, allowing the colours underneath to be seen.Falk, Catalogue \\"Krone und Schleier\\", p. 273; Beuckers, Catalogue \\"Gold vor Schwarz\\", p.86.  Crucifix  Crucifix detail Jesus stands on a suppedaneum, with his legs together. The feet are not nailed. The loincloth is knotted in the middle and falls evenly in broad folds. The arms are slightly unequal in length. The head is bent to the side and is surrounded by a halo which is attached to the horizontal member of the cross and is not adjusted to take account of the tilt of the head. Humann calls the position of the body clumsy and awkward. Humann, Die Kunstwerke der M√ºnsterkirche zu Essen, p. 119. Until 2010, the cavities on his back side contained three small relic packets, which were held in place by ties. The relics had been associated with the cross from its creation. The relic in the lowest cavity was wrapped in a purple-coloured piece of taffeta and lacks a cedula. A nocent relic wrapped in white linen is in the middle cavity with an accompanying cedula, from Innocent I (r.401-417). The script, Carolingian minuscule dates this to the 10th or 11th century and localises it to the scriptorium of Essen Abbey. Pawlik, Heilige, Reliquien und Reliquiare im Essener Stift ‚Äì ein Inventar, S. 285. There are three further fragmentary parchment cedulae on cloth fragments in the cavity in the head. The script of these has typical elements of the Essen scriptorium; one of the fragments can be attributed to Lawrence of Rome (‚Ä†258). The cross thus contained relics of Saints Lawrence and Innocent. Both of these saints were very important to the Ottonian dynasty to which Mathilde belonged: Innocent was patron saint of the oldest Ottonian abbey, Gandersheim and Otto I, Abbess Mathilde's grandfather, attributed his success in the Battle of Lechfeld (955) to Lawrence. The relic packets and cedulae are now stored in the Cathedral treasury chamber separately under inventory numbers MK1 to MK4.  Enamels  The Cross of Mathilde was equipped with forty enamel tablets, of which 37 remain: the enamel with the donor portrait, the enamel with the cross inscription, two round enamels with the personifications of the Sun and the Moon, and 33 ornamental enamels. Three further ornamental enamels were lost before the first description of the cross. Of all the objects in the Essen treasury, the Cross of Mathilde is the most richly decorated with enamel. All the enamel frames are filigreed. = Donor portrait = The enamel plaque with the donor portrait The donor enamel is in size. Its iconic \\"Seat of Wisdom\\" shows an enthroned Madonna in frontal view on the right, holding her son on her left knee, in front of a figure dressed in the white robes of a monastic. The monastic holds a cross with both hands, which she offers to the baby Jesus. The child stretches both hands towards the cross in a gesture of acceptance. An inscription MA/HTH/ILD / AB/BH/II makes it possible to identify the monastic as the Abbess Mathilde. The inscription is probably faulty, with the second word to be read as ABBATI(SSA).Hermann, Die Inschriften der Stadt Essen (Die Deutschen Inschriften vol. 81), p. 17 n. 8. Above and to the right of the Madonna are two further inscriptions, which are incomprehensible. It is theorised that they are mutilated versions of Greek inscriptions. The epigraphist Sonja Hermann suggests that the enameller confused the third and fourth letters and has inverted a Œ§, which would yield ŒúŒóŒ§ŒóŒ° (ŒºŒÆœÑŒ∑œÅ - \\"mother\\"). Hermann would read the symbols on the right, which are arranged vertically, as ŒôŒ• ŒßŒ• as an abbreviation of Œô(Œ∑œÉŒø)œç Œß(œÅŒπœÉœÑŒø)œç (\\"of Jesus Christ\\"). Hermann, Die Inschriften der Stadt Essen p. 18 n. 8. The background of the enamel is in translucent green, with the letters set in gold. Mary's head is surrounded by an opaque yellow halo and she wears a white hood as well as a translucent brown-violet robe with red ochre sleeves. Robe and sleeves are harmonised by a single gold wire outline. Mary sits on a yellow throne, with her feet in grey shoes placed on a blue footrest. Her face is beige, with her circular eyes in the same colour as the face. Eyebrows, nose and mouth are depicted with gold wire. The hieratic pose of Mary is a notable feature of the Sedes Sapentiae. The child sits on Mary's left knee, his legs hanging down between her knees. Jesus has a red halo with a gold cross. His face is detailed in gold, like Mary's. Christ wears a blue robe, with gold wire indicating folds in it, and grey shoes. Mathilde's clothing is made up of a tight white robe of a monastic, with a white hood which is detailed with gold wire. Under the robe, as is visible on her arms, she wears a blue undergarment. The cross which she holds upright is delineated with broader gold wire. Since the vertical cross beam merges into the side of the throne and the horizontal cross beam merges into the throne's armrest, the cross itself is difficult to make out. Mathilde's line of sight passes through the transept of her cross and Christ's hand to the face of her saviour. This donor portrait shows parallels with the donor portrait on the cover of the Theophanu Gospels, in which Theophanu in a similar but more horizontal pose, presents her donation to an enthroned Mary. Because of the similarity of the posture of the enthroned Madonna to the Golden Madonna of Essen it has been suggested that the actual act of donation was performed in the presence of the statue. Fremer, √Ñbtissin Theophanu und das Stift Essen, p. 102; Westermann- Angerhausen, Das Ged√§chtnis der Gegenst√§nde, p. 218. = Cross inscription = The cross inscription IHC NAZA/RENVS REX / IVDEORV is made of golden wire set in a translucent blue background. It is surrounded by a broad gold border, and the lines of the inscription are separated by golden stripes. The letters are made easily readable, but do not reach the precision of their model on the Cross of Otto and Mathilde. Eckenfels-Kunst, Goldemails. Untersuchungen zu ottonischen und fr√ºhsalischen Goldzellenschmelzen, p. 67. The dotting of the gold border, which is characteristic of the workshop of Egbert of Trier, is absent, in contrast to the inscription plaque of the Cross of Otto and Mathilde.Eckenfels-Kunst, Goldemails. Untersuchungen zu ottonischen und fr√ºhsalischen Goldzellenschmelzen, p. 251. = Sun and Moon = The personification of the Moon and the ancient cameo on the right arm of the cross The two round enamel medallions with personifications of the Sun and Moon, which symbolise the mourning of all creation at Christ's death, are located on the horizontal beam of the cross. Both personifications look towards Jesus, the Sun from the left and the Moon from the right. The background of the enamel plaque depicting the Sun is green. The bust of the Sun has a mournful expression and its hands are raised to its face. Its brown- violet eyes are round and its eyebrows as well as its bulbous nose are formed with a wire, while its wide open mouth is formed from two other wires. A furrowed brow is formed from a Y-shaped wire, reinforcing the mournful expression. The Sun wears a crown with four jagged rays in his golden hair and holds a cloth before his face. The enamel plaque of the Moon is made as a mirror image of the Sun's plaque. The Moon also holds a cloth before her face. The enamel is generally darker, the use of wire somewhat better.Eckenfels- Kunst, Goldemails. Untersuchungen zu ottonischen und fr√ºhsalischen Goldzellenschmelzen, p. 252. In contrast to the Sun's enamel, the Moon's clothing and hair are full of wires. For the face, the enameller used a single wire for the nose and the mouth. = Enamels of the edging = The enamels of the edging alternate with gemstones. In total there are five different motifs in five different colours. Eleven of the enamels have a carpet-like stepped pattern, seven enamels are divided into fields. In five enamels a diagonal cross is the motif, often featuring circular motifs with quatrefoil flowers. The remaining enamels feature modified quatrefoil flowers. Diagonal crosses, stepped patterns and quatrefoil flowers also occur as motifs on the Senkschmelz Cross.Eckenfels-Kunst, Goldemails. Untersuchungen zu ottonischen und fr√ºhsalischen Goldzellenschmelzen, p. 66. The colours employed are translucent bottle green and dark blue as well as opaque white, red, jade green, turquoise, blue and yellow. Several of the enamels have a reversed counterpart, which is sometimes located opposite.Eckenfels-Kunst, Goldemails. Untersuchungen zu ottonischen und fr√ºhsalischen Goldzellenschmelzen, S. 253-254. It is probable that all of the enamels of the edging were originally paired, so that the appearance of the cross was less chaotic than it is today.Eckenfels-Kunst, Goldemails. Untersuchungen zu ottonischen und fr√ºhsalischen Goldzellenschmelzen, p. 66.  Cameos  The Cross of Mathilde contains three classical cameo engraved gems, which have a significant iconographic role. On the horizontal beam of the cross is a brownish chalcedony, with a cameo of a lion lying down or sleeping. On the left arm of the cross, a horizontally striated onyx features a warrior with a spear and helmet in profile facing Jesus. Opposite him, on the right arm of the cross is an oval cameo with a lightly carved female bust on a dark background. All the cameos are ancient spoliaPothmann, Der Essener Kirchenschatz aus der Fr√ºhzeit der Stiftsgeschichte, p. 147, considered the lion cameo to be Medieval. The iconographic significance of the cameo gems is not yet completely clear. The lion stands on the vertical beam of the cross in the same spot in which the chased snake appears on the Cross of Otto and Mathilde and in which the Gorgon cameo appears on the Senkschmelz Cross - both of these symbolise evil's defeat as a result of the crucifixion of Christ. The lion cameo can also be put in this symbolic system.Leonhard K√ºppers, Paul Mikat, Der Essener M√ºnsterschatz. Fredebeul & Koenen, Essen 1966, p. 46. But the depiction of the lion lying peacefully might also have another meaning: in the Physiologus, a characteristic of the lion is that it brings its newborn young to life on the third day with its breath, which makes lion a symbol for the resurrection of Christ. The lion cameo could therefore also be interpreted as a reference to the hope for the resurrection of the donor depicted on the enamel plaque below it.Westermann-Angerhausen, Das Ged√§chtnis der Gegenst√§nde, pp. 219-220. The meaning of the cameos on the horizontal arms is even less clear. The use of these particular items of spolia seems intentional, but a convincing iconographic interpretation of the naked warrior with spear and helmet and the noble women has not yet been made. Since both look towards Jesus, like the Sun and the Moon, it seems possible that they are intended to amplify those images. Westermann-Angerhausen, Das Ged√§chtnis der Gegenst√§nde, p. 221.  Dating and patroness  The Cross of Mathilde is always considered in connection with the other three Ottonian processional crosses of the Essen Cathedral Treasury. Long ago, Humann noticed significant parallels with the Cross of Otto and Mathilde and the Senkschmelz Cross, such that he assumed that the goldsmith of the Cross of Mathilde had knowledge of the Cross of Otto and Mathilde (known to him as the Older Cross of Mathilde). Humann, Die Kunstwerke der M√ºnsterkirche zu Essen, p. 145. The form and general idea of the Cross of Otto and Mathilde are adopted by the Cross of Mathilde: donor portrait, crucifixion inscription, the crucified Jesus on a golden background, surrounded by an elaborate border. The adoption is particularly significant in the case of the crucifixion inscription, since the inscription on the Cross of Mathilde is directly copied from the older cross. The border is adopted from the Senkschmelz Cross. The Cross of Mathilde must, therefore be younger than these models. In 1904, Humann concluded on the basis of the image of Mathilde on it, that the Cross of Mathilde was made before 1011, the year of her death.Humann, Die Kunstwerke der M√ºnsterkirche zu Essen, p. 147. On the grounds that the Cross of Mathilde is generally less harmonised, colourful, and technically successful, it was assumed that Mathilde donated it shortly before the end of her life, when she no longer had the superior artist of the Cross of Otto and Mathilde at her disposal. Since the Cross of Otto and Mathilde was often called the \\"Cross of Mathilde\\" at that time, he called the cross the \\"Younger Cross of Mathilde\\" or the \\"Second Cross of Mathilde\\". The dating of the Cross of Mathilde to before 1011 raised art historical problems. For one thing, individual ornamental motifs are found on the Senkschmelz Cross, which was meant to be created earlier, which only become common later. For another thing, the crucified Jesus of the Cross of Mathilde shows numerous parallels to a group of cast bronze crucifixes, of which the most prominent example is the crucifix on the Cross of Hermann and Ida, which was created at least thirty years after the death of Abbess Mathilde. There are further parallels with the depictions of the cross on Cologne ivory carvings, such as the ivory book cover of the Theophanu Gospels. Beuckers, Der Essener Marsus- Schrein, p. 117. Since the current crucifix is not fitted on the inside, it was assumed that the Cross of Mathilde was made in the middle of the eleventh century and an original, chased crucifix was replaced by the casts. Since scholars assumed that Abbess Sophia had discontinued several projects of Mathilde, such as the westwerk of Essen Minster or the Marsus shrine, it was also assumed that the Cross of Mathilde was first assembled under Abbess Theophanu, or rather that she had first arranged Mathilde's donation. Fremer, √Ñbtissin Theophanu und das Stift Essen, p. 102. An argument in favour of this is the similarity of the donor portrait of the Cross of Mathilde to the donor portrait of Theophanu on the book cover of the Theophanu Gospels. A newer interpretation of the Cross of Mathilde is suggested by Klaus Gereon Beuckers. Making Theophanu herself the donor of the cross, he dates it to circa 1050. The crucifix would then be original. Beuckers included the Cross of Mathilde among the efforts of Theophanu to memorialise Mathilde. Theophanu surrounded Mathilde's grave in the new building consecrated in 1051, the crypt of Theophanu which is known today as the Altfrid Crypt, with a memorial structure, increasing the liturgical importance of her predecessor in order to increase the importance of the Abbey. Klaus Lange, \\"Die Krypta der Essener Stiftskirche. Heuristische √úberlegungen zu ihrer architektonisch-liturgischen Konzeption,\\" in Jan Gerchow, Thomas Schilp (edd.), Essen und die s√§chsischen Frauenstifte im Fr√ºhmittelalter. (Essener Forschungen zum Frauenstift, Band 2), p. 178. Theophanu, therefore, would have had new enamel made for the Cross of Mathilde, which directly recalled the older enamel already at Essen. Beuckers supposes therefore that the Cross of Mathilde was made in Essen. Since the only enamels used on the older treasures of Theophanu (the Holy Nail Gospels and the Cross of Theophanu), Theophanu probably put the enamel workshop which had made the Senkschmelz Cross and the Marsus shrine under Mathilde, back into operation for the manufacture of the Cross of Mathilde. Beuckers, Der Marsus-Schrein, p. 118; Beuckers, Catalogue \\"Gold vor Schwarz\\", p. 86; Beuckers, Farbiges Gold, p. 14, followed by Westermann-Angerhausen, Das Ged√§chtnis der Gegenst√§nde, p. 217.  History  From its creation, the cross has been located in Essen, except for evacuations during wars and other crises. On account of the depiction of Mathilde and the similarities with two other crosses of the Cathedral Treasury, which were also donations to Essen, it is assumed that it belonged to the Abbey continuously from its donation until the secularisation of Essen Abbey in 1802. However, the sources for the Essen Cathedral Treasury do not explicitly mention the cross. The Inventarium reliquiarum Essendiensium of 12 July 1627, the earliest inventory of the Abbey's treasurym does not allow a certain identification, since it only recorded \\"Two crucifixes decorated with a lot of gemstones and gold, but gilded copper on the reverse.\\" The inventory is presented by Humann, Die Kunstwerke der M√ºnsterkirche zu Essen, pp. 34-35. This description applies to all four of the processional crosses in the Essen Cathedral Treasury. The Liber Ordinarius, which controlled the liturgical use of the Abbey's treasure, speaks of processional crosses only in general terms. During the Thirty Years War, the Abbess fled with the treasure to Cologne and in 1794, as the French advanced on Essen, the Abbey Treasury was taken to Steele (modern Essen- Steele), where it was kept in an orphanage donated by the Abbess Francisca Christina of Sulzbach. At secularisation the Catholic church of St Johann Baptist took over the Abbey as well as its property, as the parish church. It made the cross, along with the rest of the Cathedral treasury accessible to the public for the first time. During the Ruhr Uprising of 1920 the whole treasury was taken in great secrecy to Hildesheim, whence it was returned in 1925 in equally secretive circumstances.Lydia Konnegen, \\"Verborgene Sch√§tze. Der Essener M√ºnsterschatz in Zeiten des Ruhrkampfes.\\" in M√ºnster am Hellweg 58, 2005, pp. 67‚Äì81. In the Second World War the Cathedral Treasury was first taken to Warstein, then to Albrechtsburg in Meissen and thence to a bunker in Siegen. After the end of the war it was found there by American troops and the cross along with the rest of the treasury was taken to the State Museum in Marburg and later to a collection for displaced artworks in Schloss Dyck in Rheydt. From April to October 1949 the Essen Cathedral Treasury was displayed in Brussels and Amsterdam, before it was brought back to Essen. With the creation of the Diocese of Essen in 1958 and the elevation of Essen Minster to the status of Cathedral, the cross became property of the diocese.  Liturgical use  The details of the liturgical use of the crosses in Essen Abbey are not known. Though the sources, particularly the Essen Liber Ordinarius which dates to around 1400, describe the use of the processional crosses for processions, they speak of these crosses in general terms, without mentioning specific crosses. Although the diocese no longer uses the Cross of Mathilde in processions on conservation grounds, it is not a museum piece, but a religious object, which can be used in religious services. For instance, it was used as the altar cross on 5 November 2011 in a memorial service on the thousandth anniversary of Mathilde's death, for whose memory it was originally gifted.

In 1741, John Bodkin, the second son of a landed gentry family in Co Galway, Ireland was arrested on the charge of murdering his older brother, Dominick. He was found guilty of the crime even though he refused to admit his guilt during his trial or thereafter. He was hanged, drawn and quartered in Galway City on Saturday, 20 March 1742. Background In 1739, John‚Äôs older brother, Dominick, heir to the family estate, died. Lord Athenry, the local Justice of the Peace deemed his death as a natural event.Oliver J Burke, Anecdotes of the Connaught Circuit‚Ä¶, Dublin, 1885, p 86-92. The suggestion that he was murdered only came to light in the aftermath of the Bodkin murders in 1741. In this inheritance-motivated family feud, three members of the Bodkin family, Oliver Bodkin, Oliver‚Äôs pregnant wife, Margery, his son, Oliver, a visitor, Marcus Lynch of Galway and from four to seven unnamed servants were murdered.Richard Pue, \\"Country News Tuam, 9 October 1741,\\" Pue‚Äôs Occurrences, Trinity College Library, Dublin; Oliver J Burke, Anecdotes of the Connaught Circuit‚Ä¶, Dublin, 1885, p 86-92; Ms 32484, Land holding, National Library of Ireland.

On the gallows in 1741, a member of the Bodkin family convicted of the Bodkin murders, accused John Bodkin of murdering his older brother. On hearing the charge, John Bodkin absconded but was arrested shortly afterwards and charged with fratricide. Name of the murdered brother The first name of John Bodkin‚Äôs older brother, Dominick, has been clarified by a primary source that draws on a description of his trial in Pue‚Äôs Occurrences in 1742: In contrast, Oliver J Burke referred to the victim as Patrick Bodkin rather than as Dominick Bodkin in his 1885 Anecdotes of the Connaught Circuit‚Ä¶ (p 86-92).Richard Pue, \\"Country News Tuam, 9 October 1741,\\" Pue‚Äôs Occurrences, Trinity College Library, Dublin; Oliver J Burke, Anecdotes of the Connaught Circuit‚Ä¶, Dublin, 1885, p 86-92. Burke may have exercised licence to avoid confusion with John‚Äôs uncle, the infamous Dominick ‚ÄúBlind‚Äù Bodkin. In fact, Patrick was the younger rather than the older brother of John Bodkin. More recent accountsJarlath O‚ÄôConnell, \\"The Bodkin Murders,\\" http://places.galwaylibrary.ie/history/chapter77.html; Martin Dolan, \\"The Bloody Bodkins,\\" Connaught Tribune, 21 Dec 1984, p 13; William Henry, \\"The Bodkin Murders\\" in Hidden Galway, Mercier Press, Cork, 2011, p 66-73. have followed Burke‚Äôs naming of the victim as Patrick Bodkin but Dominick Bodkin is used here following his identification, as the victim, by a primary source. Execution When John Bodkin was found guilty of murdering his older brother, Dominick, his response mystified the clergy, the sheriff and the gentlemen of the city. On the gibbet at Gallows Green (now Eyre Square), Galway, he refused to acknowledge his innocence or guilt of the heinous crime of fratricide. Instead, as the noose tightened around his neck, he proclaimed, \\"I forgive Mankind\\", implying that he was not guilty.Richard Pue, \\"Country News Galway, 23 March 1742,\\" Pue‚Äôs Occurrences, 23-27 Mar 1741-42, microfilm 53, Trinity College Library, Dublin.

He became secretary to Queen P≈çmare IV and married her adopted half-sister. Through his daughter's marriage to John Brander his family formed part of the influential Salmon/Brander Clan of Tahiti. Birth and early life Salmon was born Alexander Solomon in 1820 in Hastings, England. While often described as \\"the scion of a British Jewish banking family\\", his background was quite different.The Guided Jewish Tour Retrieved 1 February 2014. His father, John Solomon, was a fruiterer or greengrocer selling from a store in Piccadilly. He improved his background when he arrived in Tahiti at age 19 in 1841. This is not surprising when it is considered how he was treated by British and European visitors to Tahiti. An example of this was Captain Henry Byam Martin, commander of HMS Grampus, who in 1847 described Salmon as, \\"... a low swindling bankrupt Jew from London.\\" On his mother Rebecca's side, Alexander was a grandson of a renowned Jewish miniaturist artist, Solomon Polack. His maternal uncle was Joel Samuel Polack. Marriage and children In January 1842, Salmon married Princess Oehau, Ari'i Ari'ioehau Ari'ita'ima'i Hinari'i (1824 ‚Äì 24 June 1897), later given the title ari'i. She was the adoptive daughter of King P≈çmare II's widow, the mother of P≈çmare III and P≈çmare IV. Considered one of the highest ranking chiefesses in the land, she was head of the Teva clan, the traditional rivals of the P≈çmare family, and descended from Chief Amo and Queen Purea who received the first European explorer to Tahiti Samuel Wallis in 1767. In 1846, she was considered a rival candidate to the Tahitian throne by the French governor Armand Joseph Bruat in the event that Queen P≈çmare IV did not to return from her self-imposed exile to Raiatea and comply with a French protectorate over Tahiti.

They married into the Tahitian royal families, and were aligned through marriage and commerce with each other. A daughter of the second generation married the last King of Tahiti and was for many years known as 'the last Queen of Tahiti'. This royal connection was a major part of the prestige of what became a 'clan'. As each of family had nine children, the clan was numerically strong but on the founders' deaths many were still very young. Commercial nativity, familial distrust, poor staff management and infighting over inheritances led to the disappearance of the clan within a generation. Life in Tahiti The author Herman Melville described him thus: ‚ÄúThe lady he wedded being a near kinswoman of the queen, he became a permanent member of her majesty's household. This adventurer rose late, dressed theatrically in calico and trinkets, assumed a dictatorial tone in conversation, and was evidently on excellent terms with himself. We found him reclining on a mat, smoking a reed-pipe of tobacco, in the midst of an admiring circle of chiefs and ladies. He must have noticed our approach; but instead of rising and offering civilities, he went on talking and smoking, without even condescending to look at us.\\" Death Salmon died on 6 August 1866 in Papeete, Tahiti.

She was the daughter of Thomas Spring Rice, 2nd Baron Monteagle of Brandon, and a great- granddaughter of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Thomas Spring Rice.ThePeerage.com (#516123) Her maternal grandfather was the bishop, Samuel Butcher. She was brought up on the family's Mount Trenchard estate overlooking the River Shannon. It was a progressive, liberal household and independence of thought was encouraged. So too was the Gaelic culture and, at home, Spring Rice and her brothers were taught how to speak fluent Irish. Before the First World War, Spring Rice hosted many Irish nationalist and Conradh na Gaeilge meetings at her home, and she became a close friend of Douglas Hyde and her cousin Nelly O'Brien. During 1913 and 1914, Spring Rice was actively involved in gun-running, most notably the Howth gun-running.Martin, Francis Xavier, 1922‚Äì2000 (ed.).

This involved helping to ship weapons to be used in an Irish uprising from Germany into Ireland. Together with Molly Childers, she raised ¬£2,000 towards the purchase of 900 Mauser rifles from Germany, many of which were used in the 1916 Easter Rising. Spring Rice sailed on the Asgard to collect the guns and helped to unload them in Ireland.Peter Murtagh, 'Equally audacious: the Kilcoole gun-running', The Irish Times (19 July 2014). During the Irish War of Independence, she allowed her Mount Trenchard home to be used as a safe house by Irish Republican Army fighters and the family boat was used to carry men and arms over the Shannon Estuary. Con Collins stayed with her regularly. She helped train local women as nurses to tend to wounded nationalists and acted as an IRA message carrier between Limerick and Dublin. Throughout this time, she maintained her aristocratic fa√ßade and society connections, inviting senior Liberal Party politicians to Mount Trenchard to pressure them to support Irish independence. Death Spring Rice started to suffer from tuberculosis in 1923, and died unmarried in a sanatorium in Clwdyy, Wales, on December 1, 1924. She was buried in Mount Trenchard, Loghill, County Limerick, Ireland.

PORT was formed in June 2011 and is part of the Operations Response Unit (ORU).  History  The Operations Response Unit (ORU) is the successor to the Force Response Unit (FRU), its reported strength is 289 and was formed in 2010. The primary role of the FRU was to provide public order and riot response, in reality it was used mainly in its secondary role to provide assistance to general duties police throughout the state as required. In 1993, the FRU cleared demonstrators 'picket line' at the Richmond Secondary College using violent baton charges and pressure point tactics to forcibly remove them. In 1994, the FRU cleared environmental demonstrators blocking a Minister's office, using pressure point tactics to forcibly remove them. In September 2000, 953 police officers drawn from throughout the state, led by the FRU, were confronted by thousands of protestors, including violent protestors, at the World Economic Forum / S11 protest at Crown Casino. In 2004, the secondary role of the FRU took more prominence with the formation of the Critical Incident Response Team concept. This secondary role eventually became the primary role of the FRU (some referred to as the Critical Incident Response Unit and not FRU). The ORU was created to replace the previous role of the FRU. The ORU is split into five teams - four ORU teams and one PORT. PORT is a full-time re-invention of the now defunct Public Order Management teams (POM) which was previously made of officers with riot and public order training from around the state and used on an 'as needed' basis (part-time). PORT‚Äôs core function is to respond to demonstrations and public order incidents, such as out of control parties within metropolitan Melbourne.  Equipment  PORT is issued with a range of specialist crowd control and riot equipment. These includes protective equipment, long and short shields. On 11 October 2018, the Labor Government announced that PORT will be given $596m, to add 40 new members to the PORT team as well as purchase less than lethal police equipment including new transport vehicles, Pepperball guns, PR-24 Rigid baton, plastic handcuffs. Apart from the specialist carry vehicles, PORT members usually drive in Toyota Kluger that allow rapid deployment to metropolitan and country locations at short notice.

PORT has previously been involved in the removal of Occupy Melbourne from City Square, The GROCON Dispute and the East West Link Tunnel Protests. PORT regularly deploys large numbers of officers to A-League football matches held within Victoria. Each summer PORT is also utilized for Bushfire Response duties as part of Operation Firesetter.

She previously played basketball for the University of Virginia 1988-1991, and worked as an assistant coach at the University of Connecticut for fourteen seasons before joining the Temple coaching staff in 2008. Early years Cardoza grew up in Roxbury, Massachusetts, near Boston, where she played high school basketball at Boston English High, where she earned all-state player honors. Virginia Cardoza played for the Virginia Cavaliers between 1987 and 1991. She graduated in 1991 with a degree in anthropology. The team won the Atlantic Coast Conference regular season in 1987, 1988 and 1991. She was named captain her senior year, led the team in scoring with 15.5 points per games, and helped the team reach the 1991 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament Final Four, where they beat the Connecticut Huskies in the semifinal, then lost in overtime in the championship game. Cardoza was named to the Final Four All-Tournament team along with teammate Dawn Staley. In the semifinal game against Connecticut, Cardoza was assigned to cover Kerry Bascom, Uconn's best player. Bascom described the defense by Cardoza as like nothing she had ever seen before. In a humorous foreshadowing, on one play, Cardoza was stumbling toward the UConn bench. Head coach Auriemma \\"playfully ushered her toward a seat with the Huskies\\" Cardoza is the holder of several records at Virginia, including: * Career blocks (110) fifth place * Season rebounding leader (6.1) 1991 (tied with Staley) * Career free throws made (338) seventh place * Career Field Goal percentage (.478) eighth place * Season Field Goal percentage (.469) 1989 * Season Field Goal percentage (.544) 1991 * Career points (1622) tenth place Cardoza scored 35 points in a game against Fordham on December 28, 1988. Professional Cardoza briefly played in 1992 as a professional basketball player in Segovia, Spain following her graduation from Virginia. USA Basketball Cardoza was selected by USA Basketball to play on the U.S. Olympic Festival East team in 1987. The team played four games; in the final game Cardoza scored 13 to help the team win the bronze medal at the event. Connecticut Cardoza joined the UConn coaching staff in 1994, the year the Huskies won their first national title. Cardoza was an accomplished assessor of talent. In 2002, Maria Conlon was the only player from Connecticut on the UConn roster. Head coach Auriemma was not convinced she could be \\"counted on to contribute on a meaningful level\\". However, Cardoza shared her assessment with the head coach, \\"You're looking at our starting point guard next year\\". Conlon would go on to be the starting point guard for the next two seasons, and helped lead the Huskies to a National Championships in 2004, dishing out six assist and recording zero turnovers in 39 minutes of the championship game. Temple In 2008 Dawn Staley, a Virginia teammate of Cardoza, left the Temple head coaching position to take the head coaching position at the University of South Carolina. Cardoza was named to replace Staley as head coach at Temple. Cardoza joked that she was surprised Temple was so good defensively, quipping that Staley hadn't been much of a defensive player in college. But it was a good-natured jab between former teammates. Cardoza and Staley had both played for Virginia in their playing careers. She followed th jab with serious respect, noting that Staley \\"set the bar\\". Under Cardoza, the Owls contributed to reach the NCAA tournament for the next three seasons, reaching the second round twice. When Temple joined the American Athletic Conference, that meant games against Cincinnati as part of the conference schedule. These would not simply be another date in the schedule. Cincinnati is coached by Jamelle Elliott, who played for UConn when Cardoza joined the coaching staff, then coached alongside her when both were assistants under Auriemma. Elliott describes Cardoza simply as \\"my best friend. I have known her over half my life. She coached me, we talk almost everyday, she is someone I would lay down my life for, I can't describe how close we are.\\" Now they square off as opponents. In their first two meetings each team won once, the Owls winning the first and the Bearcats winning the return game, each team winning on the opponents court. Cardoza found that the role of head coach was very different than that of an assistant. When she was an assistant, she did have things to worry about but she felt she could step away. As a head coach, she doesn't have that luxury. When she was an assistant, she prided herself on being a players coach, and thought she could always do that, but she has found that the relationship of a head coach to the players is different. She added Willnett Crockett to her staff, whom she had coached while at UConn. Now Crockett, as an assistant coach, fills the role Cardoza used to fill.

He was the nephew and successor of Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad.  Rise to power  Ghiyath was the son of Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad, who was the brother of Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad. When Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad was assassinated in 1206 in India, the Ghurid Empire fell into civil war; the Turkish ghulams supported Ghiyath, while the native Iranian soldiers supported Baha al-Din Sam II. Baha al-Din Sam II, however, died after a few days later, which made the Iranian soldiers support his two sons Jalal al-Din Ali and Ala al-Din Muhammad. Meanwhile, Firuzkuh was controlled by the Ghurid prince Diya al-Din Muhammad. Ghiyath, however, managed to defeat them all and crown himself as Sultan of the Ghurid Empire.The Iranian World, C.E. Bosworth, The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 5, ed. J. A. Boyle, John Andrew Boyle, (Cambridge University Press, 1968), 161-170. However, Jalal al-Din managed to capture Ghazni, and made his brother the ruler of the city.  Reign  The Turkic general Taj al-Din Yildiz shortly managed to seize Ghazni from the sons of Baha al-Din Sam II, but shortly recognized the authority of Ghiyath. Ghiyath, not glad about Taj al-Din controlling Ghazni, and not daring to leave Ghur unprotected, requested help from the Khwarazmian Muhammad II of Khwarezm. Muhammad, however, instead invaded the domains of Ghiyath, capturing Balkh and Tirmidh.Michel Biran, The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History, (Cambridge University Press, 2005), 70. Luckily for Ghiyath, Muhammad was captured by the Kara-Khitan Khanate. Husain ibn Kharmil, a former Ghurid general, who had changed allegiance to the Khwarazmians, shortly entered a negotiation with Ghiyath. However, the negotiation turned fruitless, and Ghiyath sent an army against Husain, which, was, however, defeated. Thirteen months later, Muhammad was freed from captivity, and once again invaded the domains of Ghiyath, capturing Herat. Muhammad then invaded the Ghurid heartland of Ghur, and captured Ghiyath. Ghiyath then agreed to recognize Muhammad's authority, and remained ruler of the Ghurid dynasty until he was assassinated in 1212. He was succeeded by his son Baha al-Din Sam III.

The result came as a shock to many politicians and commentators, and came to symbolise the extent of the Labour landslide victory under the leadership of Tony Blair. Background There had been a poll in The Observer newspaper on the weekend before the election which showed that Portillo held only a three- point lead in his hitherto safe seat. Portillo had been widely expected to contest the Conservative leadership after the General Election, which without a Commons seat he was unable to do. He had a memorable interview with Jeremy Paxman on the election night prior to the calling of his own seat. Paxman decisively opened the interview with the question \\"so Michael, are you going to miss the limo?\\" - a clear reference to the strong feeling going around on election night that he had lost his own seat. Portillo was then stumped with the follow up question of \\"are we seeing the end of the Conservative Party as a credible force in British politics?\\". He has since admitted that he knew he had lost his seat by the time of the interview: Declaration The election result was announced live on national television. Enfield Mayor Patrick Cunneen was the returning officer. The candidates lined up on the stage at the Picketts Lock Leisure Centre in Enfield, while Cunneen read out the results, starting with these candidates: * Jeremy Browne (Liberal Democrats) ‚Äì 4,966 (10.7%) * Nicholas Luard (Referendum Party) ‚Äì 1,342 (2.9%) * Andrew Malakouna (Mal ‚Äì Voice of the People) ‚Äì 229 (0.5%). There was a brief ripple of laughter when Cunneen read out Portillo's given names ‚Äì Michael Denzil Xavier ‚Äì and then quiet as he announced Portillo's vote ‚Äì 19,137 (41.1%) ‚Äì followed by some applause. After announcing the results for Alan Storkey of the Christian Democrat Party ‚Äì 289 (0.6%) ‚Äì and waiting for brief cheers from Storkey's supporters to subside, Cunneen announced Twigg's name and then his vote ‚Äì 20,570 votes (44.2%) ‚Äì triggering sustained loud celebrations from Labour supporters. Portillo's defeat represented a 17.4% swing to Labour. Although Twigg retained the seat with an increased majority in 2001, it returned to the Conservative Party in 2005 with a swing of 8.7%. 'Portillo moment' The 1997 loss, symbolising the loss of the election by the Conservative Party, has been referred to as \\"the Portillo moment\\", and in the clich√© \\"Were you up for Portillo?\\" (i.e., \\"Were you awake/did you see Portillo's result announced on television?\\") Portillo himself commented, thirteen years later, that as a consequence \\"My name is now synonymous with eating a bucketload of shit in public.\\"My moment is yours, Ed Balls Michael Portillo, The Guardian, 6 May 2010 ResultReferencesExternal links * Video of Conservative Michael Portillo losing his seat to Labour's Stephen Twigg Category:Elections in the London Borough of Enfield Category:1997 in London Category:United Kingdom general election results in London Category:1997 United Kingdom general election ","title":"Enfield Southgate in the 1997 general election"},{"id":"41809327","text":"A Kenyan Judicial stamp used at Mombasa in 1929. Kenya & Uganda stamps fiscally used on a 1933 passport page. Kenya, formerly known as British East Africa issued revenue stamps since 1891. There were numerous types of revenue stamps for a variety of taxes and fees. Also valid for fiscal use in Kenya were postage stamps issued by the following entities: *Imperial British East Africa Company (1890‚Äì1895) *British East Africa Protectorate (1895‚Äì1903) *East Africa and Uganda Protectorates (1903‚Äì1922) *Kenya and Uganda (1922‚Äì1935) *Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika (1935‚Äì1959) British East Africa In 1891 and 1892, postage stamps of the Imperial British East Africa Company were handstamped locally INLAND REVENUE for use as general purpose duty stamps. In 1895 and 1896, similar overprints were applied to postage stamps of British East Africa, which were already overprints on stamps of the British East Africa Company or India. Around 1898, stamps portraying Queen Victoria were also issued with this overprint. In 1897, the Queen Victoria issue was also overprinted CONSULAR SERVICE, and between that year and 1901, various stamps were also overprinted or handstamped JUDICIAL FEE for use in law courts. Proofs exist for British East Africa impressed duty stamps, but these were probably never issued. East Africa and Uganda On 1 April 1903, the postal service of British East Africa joined with that of Uganda, forming a joint postal service with stamps inscribed East Africa and Uganda Protectorates. Between 1903 and 1904, some of these stamps which portrayed the new monarch King Edward VII were handstamped JUDICIAL FEE in violet, either reading up or horizontally. About a year later in 1905, these were replaced by stamps with an overprint in seriffed capitals, and these exist with two different watermarks. Although the inscription on these stamps implied that they were valid in Uganda, the judicial overprints were only valid in the East Africa Protectorate, as Uganda had separate revenue stamps. In the 1940s and 1950s, proofs were also prepared for cigarette excise stamps inscribed Kenya, Uganda & Tanganyika Excise Duty. However no issued strips are known and they are only known to exist at the Crown Agents archives in the British Library and from the printers' archives. Kenya Kenya's first revenues were King George V postage stamps of Kenya & Uganda overprinted KENYA JUDICIAL between 1928 and 1930. There were two types, the first printed locally by an unknown printer, and the second printed in London by De La Rue. Between 1936 and 1959 Kenya issued five stamps for Kodi (Poll Tax). These are large Nyasaland keytypes with the portraits of either King George V, King George VI or Queen Elizabeth II. All of these are rare and command high prices by collectors. Around 1954, KUT postage stamps portraying Queen Elizabeth II and local scenes were overprinted KENYA REVENUE. These were replaced by a new design showing an African lion in 1956 which remained in use until the late 1970s. All other designs since then featured lions, either as heraldic or naturalistic. In 2011 forgeries to defraud the KRA were found. Between 1963 and the early 1970s stamps were issued to pay the Graduated Personal Tax, and from 1966 to 2001 stamps were issued annually to pay the Hospital Tax, later known as the National Hospital Insurance Fund. Between 1972 and the 1990s, Kenya issued stamps to pay for airport passenger service fees. These are denominated either in Kenyan shillings for local or in US dollars for international flights, and around 1995, stamps showing Mount Kenya were issued to pay the Services Charge, known locally as Huduma. Kenya also issues excise stamps for use on wine or spirits, but these are currently being phased out due to the discovery of forgeries to defraud the KRA. Kenya had impressed duty stamps from 1927 to 1973 and meter stamps from 1973 to 1999.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. Monticello was laid out in the 1850s, but none of its early commercial buildings have survived. The oldest buildings date from the 1890s to c. 1912, and were built around the square that then housed the county courthouse, and which now is an open grassy park. The city blocks abutting the park north and west have been redeveloped, and are not a part of the district. Buildings along the park's south and east side (North Main Street and West Gaines Street), and extending east from their (along East Gaines Street and East McCloy Street), date for the most part from the 1890s to 1961, although many buildings have since been altered to some degree. Most of the buildings were built between 1921 and 1961. Many of the buildings in the district are joined in rows by party walls. They were built of brick, and are stylistically vernacular. Notable exceptions are the Art Deco Post Office (separately listed on the National Register), a Moderne-style building on North Main Street, and the five story Mediterranean Revival Ridgeway Hotel (also separately listed), which is also the district's tallest building. The two most architecturally elaborate buildings are 202 and 204 North Main Street, Italianate structures built c. 1900. The district has seen some alteration in recent years, and some period buildings do not contribute as a consequence. The double building at 103‚Äì107 North Bailey, for instance, is a single-story early-20th-century brick building which has had facade alterations made that are not sympathetic to its character. A building of similar age at 120 North Main has been slip-covered in metal.

She is best known for her public art installation HighWaterLine, which premiered in New York City in 2007. Her predictions about where waters would rise due to climate change were validated by flood levels during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Other locations for installations of HighWaterLine include Miami, Florida, where it was created with the help of volunteers (2013) and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (2014). Installations have been discussed for Dublin, Ireland, and London, England. Early works Eve Mosher initially worked as a studio artist, creating abstract interpretations of the natural and built environments through drawings, sculptures, and installations. Then, in 2006, she felt a need to do something in response to climate change and began to brainstorm ideas. She was an Exhibiting Artist at Eyebeam in 2008 and 2009. HighWaterLine=New York City, New York In 2007 artist Eve S. Mosher created a public art project in Brooklyn and Manhattan that brought the topic of climate change literally to the doorsteps of the city's residents. Scientists had predicted that water levels in New York, in the event of a \\"hundred year flood\\", could rise ten feet above sea level. But with sea levels rising along the East Coast -- a natural phenomenon accelerated by climate change -- they now projected that what was once considered a 100-year flood could soon happen as often as every 3 to 20 years. Eve Mosher used topographic maps, satellite images, and data from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies at Columbia University, to predict the locations likely to be subject to flooding. Then Mosher walked 70 miles of New York coastline, pushing a \\"Heavy Hitter\\" (a baseball field line machine) to draw a 4\\" blue chalk line on the ground, marking the predicted water levels. In areas where she was unable to draw a line, she marked the high water boundary with illuminated beacons. The project was completed over a period of six months. Mosher's HighWaterLine went past low-income housing developments, luxury apartment buildings, power stations, nursing homes, and hospitals. One observer wrote later, \\"it was beyond moving to see an artist simplify complex data that typically might seem too abstract to relate to.\\" Along the way, people came up to her to ask what she was doing, and Mosher talked with them. A significant goal of the project was to engage local people and hear their stories. Heidi Quante, a creative coordinator with the climate action group 350.org, reported that \\"Eve really found a new way of teaching people... Her art was so good, she became a magnet. And when people learn by asking rather than being told, they retain the information better.\\" Two years later, when Hurricane Irene approached, areas below Mosher's HighWaterLine were evacuated. Luckily Irene veered away from the city. Four years later, Mosher's predictions were strikingly validated when the storm surge from Hurricane Sandy flooded many of the areas she had traversed. Miami, Florida In Miami, HighWaterLine was collaboratively installed after considerable advance planning and work by Eve Mosher, Heidi Quante and volunteers from the community-led Resilient Miami action group. More than 70 different residents marked the line in their own neighborhoods, each passing the field marker to the next person. The result was a 26-mile-long continuous line, created over three days, November 13, 14, and 17, 2013. Mosher intentionally expanded her engagement with the community before and after the project, but the goal of interacting with people continued to be creating conversations and awareness. \\"I really believe that using creativity in taking on the complex challenges of climate change is a way to allow everyone to participate. Putting those tools in the hands of individual community members allows them to go into their own neighborhood and bring their neighbors into the conversation in ways that no one outside of the community can do.\\" She has also worked with Patricia Watts and Amy Lipton to develop a \\"HighWaterLine ACTION GUIDE\\", to help people locally engage with their communities and develop their own installations of HighWaterLine. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  An installation of HighWaterLine occurred in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in May 2014. Mosher worked with local Philadelphia residents to draw a thick chalk line through four miles of sidewalks and streets in the Kensington, Fishtown and Port Richmond neighborhoods. Philadelphia's ten-foot zone includes numerous industrial and factory sites: flooding would impact a number of Superfund sites, polluted locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.

History  The German Shoe Road was established in 1977 by the Pirmasens Regional Association (Gro√üraum Pirmasens), because the heart of the German shoe industry was based here from the early 19th century. After many shoe factories in Germany closed or transferred their manufacturing overseas in the wake of globalisation, the German Shoe Road was not widely advertised and was one of less well known tourist routes by the early 21st century.  Sights  Lakes and rivers ‚Äì east of Waldfischbach-Burgalben the route passes along the Schwarzbachtal valley and runs past the Clausensee lake. Almost all other sections of the German Shoe Road run along waterways in the region. In the area of Pirmasens these include the Schwarzbach Queich, Wieslauter, Saarbach (with its M√ºhlweiher reservoir at the Saarbacherhammer), Rodalb and Merzalbe.

Background The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board was first chartered under the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The role of the board is to provide advice and review of whether adequate supervision, guidelines, and oversight exist and to \\"continually review\\" regulations, policies, procedures, and information sharing practices to ensure privacy and civil liberties considerations are protected. To carry out these roles, the board does not have subpoena power, but is able to request subpoenas subject to the U.S. Attorney General's discretion \\"to protect sensitive law enforcement or counterterrorism information or ongoing operations.\\" The U.S. Director of National Intelligence also has the power to override requests \\"to protect the national security interests of the United States\\" A report by former members of the 9/11 commission in December 2005 noted there was \\"little urgency\\" in creation of the board, whose first meeting was in 2006. It was initially composed of a chair, vice chair, and three other members. As these members served at the pleasure of the President, \\"Critics ... maintained that the board appeared to be a presidential appendage, devoid of the capability to exercise independent judgment and assessment or to provide impartial findings and recommendations\\", according to the Congressional Research Service. Subsequently member Lanny Davis resigned in protest over the board's lack of independence, citing \\"extensive redlining by Administration officials of the board's first report to Congress\\" that was accepted by the other members. The board was then reconstituted under the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (H.R. 1), beginning in January 2008, as an independent agency with appointments subject to Senate confirmation. Four members of the board were nominated by President Barack Obama in 2011, and confirmed by the Senate in August 2012. Board chairman David Medine was finally confirmed in May 2013 in the wake of the Snowden disclosures in a party-line vote with 53 Democrats supporting and 45 Republicans opposing. Global surveillance disclosures The Board's report follows a series of highly publicized leaks about the operations of the global surveillance program conducted by the National Security Agency in the United States working with a number of other countries (see Five Eyes). While the program's nominal focus was on foreign nationals, the disclosures also revealed the large-scale surveillance of communications by United States citizens. These leaks were largely the work of Edward Snowden, a Booz Allen Hamilton employee with access to a wide range of top secret documents. Publications of the documents by The Washington Post and The Guardian began in June 2013. Report On January 23, 2014, the board released its report, recommending the US end bulk data collection. Instead federal agencies would be able to obtain phone and other records under court orders in cases containing an individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. But there would be no storehouse, private or public, of telephone data beyond what the phone companies keep in the course of their normal business activities. The report concluded that the program \\"lacks a viable legal foundation\\". It concluded \\"we see little evidence that the unique capabilities provided by the NSA's bulk collection of telephone records actually have yielded material counterterrorism results that could not have been achieved without the NSA's Section 215 program.\\" The report concluded: \\"Cessation of the program would eliminate the privacy and civil liberties concerns associated with bulk collection without unduly hampering the government's efforts, while ensuring that any governmental requests for telephone calling records are tailored to the needs of specific investigations.\\" The report called for a \\"Special Advocate\\" to be involved in some cases before the FISA court judge. The Board also contained the recommendation to release future and past FISC decisions \\"that involve novel interpretations of FISA or other significant questions of law, technology or compliance.\\" The report also recommended against an alternate proposal, which President Barack Obama had ordered Attorney General Eric Holder to formulate within 60 days, which would force third parties including telephone companies to conduct data retention. The panel's majority spokesman said this was due to cost and legal exposure for the companies involved, and that it was not an \\"easy out\\". Reactions Sen. Ron Wyden, a senior member of the intelligence committee and long-time critic of the programs, released a statement in reaction to the report. Said Wyden: > \\"The privacy board's findings closely mirror many of the criticisms made by > surveillance reform advocates. The bulk collection program was built on a > murky legal foundation that raises many constitutional questions and has > been proven to be an ineffective tool for collecting unique intelligence > information. Moreover, as the board wrote in its report, a program where the > government collects the telephone records of millions of law-abiding > Americans 'fundamentally shifts the balance of power between the state and > its citizens.' The board goes on to say that with the government's 'powers > of compulsion and criminal prosecution,' collection of data on its own > citizens 'poses unique threats to privacy,' and is expected to have a > 'chilling effect on the free exercise of speech and association.'\\" Asked by Pat M√§chler to what extent the report will have an impact, Edward Snowden stated: > I don't see how Congress could ignore it, as it makes it clear there is no > reason at all to maintain the 215 program. Let me quote from the official > report: \\"Cessation of the program would eliminate the privacy and civil > liberties concerns associated with bulk collection without unduly hampering > the government's efforts, while ensuring that any governmental requests for > telephone calling records are tailored to the needs of specific > investigations.\\" See also * Mass surveillance in the United States ReferencesExternal links * Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board Report on the Telephone Records Program Conducted under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT and on the Operations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court Category:2014 in the United States Category:Global surveillance Category:Reports of the United States government ","title":"Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board report on mass surveillance"},{"id":"41809905","text":"Lepsi () is a dishBot generated title --> from D√ºzce eaten by both Turkish and Circassian people.

Of more than twenty manufacturers building wooden tool chests for journeymen in the early 20th century, H. Gerstner & Sons is the only one to still exist. History left The company was started in 1906 by journeyman woodworker Harry Gerstner, using a one hundred dollar bonus he had earned upon the earlier completion of his apprenticeship. The name \\"H. Gerstner & Sons\\" was chosen because it sounded well-established, but Harry Gerstner would never have any sons, instead raising three daughters with his wife, Emma. The original building occupied by the company was damaged in the Great Dayton Flood of 1913. Later that year, a new factory was built, where production has remained since. Products H. Gerstner & Sons produces primarily tool chests, but their products also include shooter's chests, fly tying chests, jewelry boxes, and humidors. Additionally, the company will custom-build chests to a customer's specifications. As of 2001, approximately 4000 chests left the factory each year. For a short period of time in their early years, Gerstner & Sons also ventured into the boat manufacturing business. The chests were originally made of oak, although they were ultimately also offered in cherry, walnut, and maple. While a single batch of chests (numbering as many as fifty) is being built, the drawers are selected and grouped together based on the style of their grain. Each drawer is then designated for a particular slot in a chest. The chests are assembled, sanded, and finished all in the same building, and most models also receive felt drawer lining. The tall, narrow center drawer on the popular Model 52 is sized to hold a copy of Machinery's Handbook, and the mirror inside the top lid was reportedly included to aid machinists in removing metal filings from their eyes.

In the 1930s the Korean population shifted to an area between Normandie and Vermont Streets in the Jefferson Boulevard area. This Korean area, which became known as the \\"Old Koreatown,\\" was in proximity to the University of Southern California. By then the first generation of Korean immigrants had children, who lived around the Old Koreatown. In the 1950s, Los Angeles received a second wave of Korean immigrants resulting from the Korean War and the children of the first generation of immigrants gave birth to the next generation. After the passage of the Hart-Cellar Act in 1965, Korean immigration increased. After the Watts Riots in 1965, many Koreans began moving to suburban communities. In 1970, the Koreans in Los Angeles and Orange Counties made up 63% of the total number of Koreans in the United States. Around this period, the Korean community area moved to Olympic Boulevard, where the modern Koreatown is located. The Korean community was severely affected by the 1992 Los Angeles riots. One Korean American civilian, Edward Song Lee, died in the rioting.Abelmann and Lie, p. ix (Preface). Over $400 million worth of damages occurred, including the destruction of over 2,000 businesses owned by ethnic Koreans.Kim, Katherine Yungmee, p. 10. Most of the members of the Korean community refer to them in Korean as the 4-2-9 riot (Sa-i-gu p'oktong). This naming follows the integer naming schemes of political events in Korean history. After the event, many Koreans moved to suburbs in Orange County and the two Inland Empire counties: Riverside and San Bernardino. Since then, investment occurring in Koreatown caused the community to rebuild.

Geography As of 2008, about 350,000 ethnic Koreans live in Los Angeles County.Covarrubias, Amanda. \\"Koreatown finds suburban home.\\" Los Angeles Times. February 23, 2008. Retrieved on February 25, 2014. As of 2008 the largest Korean ethnic enclave in Los Angeles is Koreatown and the majority of the Koreans have been concentrated around that area. By 2008 many ethnic Korean communities had appeared in the northwestern San Fernando Valley, including Chatsworth, Granada Hills, Northridge, and Porter Ranch. That year, the San Fernando Valley Korean Business Directory had a list of almost 1,500 Korean-owned businesses in the San Fernando Valley. Amanda Covarrubias of the Los Angeles Times stated that area Korean community leaders estimated that 50,000 to 60,000 Koreans lived in the San Fernando Valley in 2008. In addition, by 2008 Korean communities had appeared in Cerritos and Hacienda Heights in Los Angeles County, and Buena Park and Fullerton in Orange County. Demographics As of 2008, 257,975 Korean Americans lived in Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, San Bernardino, and Riverside counties, making up 25% of all of the Korean Americans. As of that year, over 46,000 Koreans lived in Koreatown, making up 20.1% of the residents there. Koreatown, in addition to Koreans, houses other ethnic groups. Economics By 1988, in Los Angeles, many Korean stores had opened in African-American neighborhoods, and by then several boycotts by African-Americans of Korean businesses had occurred.Light and Bonacich, p. xii. By that time many Korean garment manufacturers acted as middlemen by employing Hispanic workers and selling product to White-owned manufacturers of clothing.Light and Bonacich, p. xiii. In 2014 the federal government ran a raid against business operations that it accused of being money laundering. By 2015 some Korean business owners stated that they may take their operations out of Los Angeles due to a reduction in Latin American customers, an increasing minimum wage, and stricter governmental enforcement of labor laws, all occurring after the 2014 raid.Kim, Victoria. \\"The fight to keep Korean businesses in L.A.\\" Los Angeles Times.

Artists represented/exhibited by the gallery have included Doug and Mike Starn, Vik Muniz, Andres Serrano, Dennis Oppenheim, Elaine Sturtevant, Inka Essenhigh, and Orlan.  History = Boston 1980‚Äì1988  Stux Gallery was founded in 1980 in Boston, by Stefan Stux and his wife Linda Bayless Stux. Prior to opening the gallery, Stefan, who holds a Ph.D. in Immunology, had been teaching at Harvard Medical School, while Linda was a performance artist who taught math at Boston Latin School; a shared interest in contemporary art drew them into the gallery business. The gallery opened on Newbury Street in December 1980, representing a group of artists from the Boston area, notably including Doug Anderson, Gerry Bergstein, Alex and Allison Grey, and Paul Laffoley, among others. It became a leader in what the Boston Globe called a \\"Boston art renaissance\\" in the early 1980s. Doug and Mike Starn, who attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, met Stefan and Linda Stux at their graduation ceremony in May 1985, and received their first show at the gallery in the following September. The success of their early work raised the gallery's profile beyond Boston, leading to the opening of a second location on Spring Street in the SoHo district of Manhattan. Both galleries continued to run simultaneously, until the Boston location was finally closed in 1988.  New York 1986‚Äì1993  The gallery's presence in the New York art scene was secured when the Starn Twins were selected for the 1987 Whitney Biennial. The gallery developed a roster primarily composed of emerging artists, adding Lawrence Carroll, Vik Muniz, Holt Quentel, and Andres Serrano to their stable, giving each of these artists their first solo shows in New York. Fabian Marcaccio and Cary Leibowitz (aka Candy Ass) also received their first gallery exposure at Stux. In addition to these emerging artists, the gallery also hosted solo shows for senior artists such as Elaine Sturtevant and Gerhard Hoehme. Stux began publishing catalogues for each of its artists‚Äô shows, featuring essays by prominent art critics and historians, including Dan Cameron, Robert Pincus-Witten, Donald Kuspit, and others. It also engaged independent curators such as Collins & Milazzo and Christian Leigh to organize group exhibitions in its space, in order to develop a critical context for its artists. In 1988, Stux entered into a collaboration with Leo Castelli Gallery for a dual-exhibition of new work by the Starns. When the international art market as a whole foundered in the early 1990s, the gallery ultimately closed its operations on Spring Street. After that closure in 1993, as Stux engaged in lower-overhead private, secondary market dealing for several years.  Piss Christ controversy  In 1987, the gallery first exhibited Andres Serrano‚Äôs Piss Christ, which subsequently became the focus of major public controversy as a flash point in the ‚Äúculture wars‚Äù, because it had been produced with partial support from a grant funded by the National Endowment for the Arts. The photograph‚Äîwhich features a plastic crucifix suspended in a plexiglass tank of the artist‚Äôs own urine‚Äîwas cited for blasphemy by the fundamentalist American Family Association, and subsequently denounced in the U.S. Senate by Jesse Helms and Alphonse D‚ÄôAmato.  New York 1996-present  In 1996, Stux reopened on 20th Street in the Chelsea district of Manhattan. There, the gallery continued to introduce more young talent such as Inka Essenhigh, and began to show internationally established artists such as Dennis Oppenheim and Orlan, and mid-career artists including James Croak and Margaret Evangeline as well. In 2002, Andrea Schnabl joined the gallery as a new Partner and Director. In 2004, the gallery moved once again into a larger ground floor space at 530 W. 25th Street. Its roster of international artists has since expanded to include Nigerian sculptor Sokari Douglas Camp, CBE, photographer Ruud van Empel of the Netherlands, painter Thordis Adalsteinsdottir of Iceland, Iraqi photographer Halim Al Karim and Japanese photographer Manabu Yamanaka, multi media conceptual German artists Gia Edzgveradze and Heide Hatry and leading contemporary Chinese artists Wei Dong and Zhang Xiaotao, among others. In the Spring of 2014, Stux Gallery relocated uptown to the historic 57th Street district, renowned for the birth of early American Modernism in fine art, occupying an expansive 4,000 sq. foot space on the 6th floor of the noted New York Gallery Building at 24 West 57th Street near 5th Avenue, neighboring the Marian Goodman Gallery‚Äôs 3rd and 4th floor domain. In the summer of 2017 Stux Gallery opened Salon STUX West in a historic townhouse on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Stux Gallery regularly participates in significant art fairs and in collaborations with galleries and curators in the U.S. and abroad.

It is the largest and busiest railway station of Punjab. History The Sind, Punjab and Delhi Railway completed the Multan-Lahore-Amritsar line in 1865. The Amritsar-Attari section was completed on the route to Lahore in 1862. The long Amritsar‚ÄìKhem Karan railway line runs through Tarn Taran and Patti. A long line links Amritsar to Dera Baba Nanak on the bank of the Ravi. The Amritsar‚ÄìPathankot route runs through Batala and Gurdaspur. The wide broad gauge Amritsar-Pathankot line was opened in 1884. Overview The Amritsar railway station is located at an elevation of and was assigned the code \\"ASR.\\" With this, it has become the busiest railway station of the state in terms of passenger movement and train traffic. In the 2016 railway budget, the government has aimed to beautify the railway station as it is the main station of the holy city. The railway station is the first and only with WiFi in the division and CCTV has recently been enabled. In the recent railway budget, it has been mentioned that Amritsar Junction will be improved due to its importance in various fields. The Movement Control Office (MCO) for Armed Forces is also available at PF no 1. There are ten platforms under use, 1(A), 1(B), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Platform no. 8 is used for freight trains. Platform no. 1(B) is reserved exclusively for freight and passenger trains of Indian Army. Electrification The Phagwara-Jallandhar City-Amritsar sector was electrified in 2003‚Äì04. Development Amritsar became the first railway station in the state to be WiFi-enabled. With this announcement, concerns have also been raised around increasing the capacity of the railway station from the current 6 platforms to 8 platforms and base this on the standards of the International Airport. This is due to the fact that it is the most important and busiest railway terminus of the state. Two more escalators would be installed in the station from Platform 5, as Platform 1 has already two. Platform No. 6 and 7 are started in January 2018 because of due to large movement of passengers in the city. Upcoming Projects The electrification work is under progress on the Amritsar-Khemkaran line. This is because, a new rail line has been passed by the railways from Patti, Punjab to Ferozpur which will reduce the distance of Amritsar from Ferozpur by 20 km. This will also reduces the distance and save the time to visit Rajasthan and Gujarat from Northern cities. It has been planned to run Express trains on this route. In December 2019, it has been announced that Bhagtanwala Railway Station and Chheharta Railway Station will be converted into satellite stations. Due to this the burden on Amritsar Junction railway station can be reduced. Railway workshop Amritsar railway workshop carries out a periodic overhaul of WDS-4 locos and breakdown cranes and bogie manufacture.

Khosta is located in the mouth of the Khosta River, between the center of Sochi and Adler. The area is served by the Khosta railway station. History The Transfiguration Church in Khosta In the Middle Ages, Genoa supported a colony (Costa) at the location of modern Khosta. Eventually the area was taken by the Ottoman Empire, and the settlement was known as Khamysh. After the Russo-Turkish War of 1828‚Äì29 it was occupied by the Russian Empire, and the whole population was eventually resettled to Turkey. In 1891‚Äî1892 the coastal road between Novorossiysk and Batumi was constructed, and first settlers appeared in Khosta. On May 15, 1899, Khosta was granted town status. At the time, it belonged to Black Sea Governorate with the center in Novorossiysk. By 1914, Khosta had a population of 1,500 inhabitants, a brick factory, and a wine production plant. Soviet Power was declared in Khosta in February 1918, followed by the advance of the army of the Democratic Republic of Georgia, which in July 1918 occupied the whole coast up to Tuapse. In February 1919, they were driven back by the Volunteer Army under command of Anton Denikin. Between January and May 1920, the Red Army recaptured the area. In 1933, it was decided to totally reconstruct the coastal area and to create a large number of spa resorts. To this end, in October 1934 Khosta was subordinated to the city of Sochi. In the 1950s and the 1960s there was large-scale construction in Khosta. Economy The economy of Khosta is based on its importance as a spa and a beach vacation resort. Transportation The railway that connects Adler and Sochi by following the coast has a station in Khosta. Suburban trains from Sochi and from Krasnaya Polyana stop there. The M27 Highway connecting Novorossiysk with Adler crosses Khosta. The microdistrict is served by the bus system of the city of Sochi. Culture and recreation Even though the history of Khosta goes back to the 19th century, there are very few pre-1930 buildings. Those that survived include the Transfiguration Church and a number of pre-1917 dachas. Near surroundings of Khosta are popular holiday destinations. *Khosta Fortress, or rather the ruins thereof, perched on the top of a 100-meter high cliff within six kilometers () from the sea coast. *The fortress stands on the grounds of an ancient grove of yews and boxwood, which may be up to 30 mya old. The largest yews attain a height of 50 meters; one is estimated to be 2,000 years old. The grove covers an area of 301 ha and has been affiliated with the Caucasus Zapovednik since 1931 and is the World Heritage Site as a part of the Zapovednik. *The Akhun massif comprises Greater Akhun Mtn. (663 m), Lesser Akhun Mtn. (501 m), and Eagle Bluff (380 m). Greater Akhun is crowned by a Neo-Romanesque limestone tower (1936) that offers glimpses of Pitsunda and Gagra across the border in Abkhazia. There is also a chain of twenty karst caves in the massif.  Eponyms  * Khostalestes kochetkovi, a slug species discovered in the mountains north of Khosta, is named after Khosta.

Founded in 1910, in 1962 it moved into a new building in the City Park designed by Jytte og Ove Tapdrup. Since 1997, the museum has formed part of a complex which also contains the Esbjerg Performing Arts Centre. History Founded as Esbjerg Kunstforening (Esberg's Art Association) in 1910, the museum was first located in the public library (Esbjerg Bibliotek) in 1927. In 1930, it purchased works by modernists such as Harald Giersing, Edvard Weie and Vilhelm Lundstr√∏m. After moving into the new building in the City Park in 1962, the museum acquired concrete works by Richard Mortensen and Robert Jacobsen as well as works from artists participating in the Linien and Linien II associations. Architecture Originally known as Kunstpavillonen (the Art Pavilion), the building in the City Park was designed by Jytte and Ove Tapdrup. Commanding an excellent position near the Water Tower overlooking the harbour, the complex consists of a low permanent art gallery wing to the north and a two-storey exhibition area to the south. After the music conservatory moved into new premises in 1974, the museum gained additional space for the municipal collection which was extended with many important new works. The complex adopts a simple, refined style which takes advantage of the sloping ground with floors at various levels and a number of balconies. The concrete structure has aluminium windows and spandrel panels decorated with pebbles. In 1997, it was connected to the newly completed Esbjerg Performing Arts Centre by means of an extensive foyer serving both institutions. In this connection, various extensions were made to the museum, latterly in 2005. Collection The permanent collection covers Danish works from the beginning of the 20th century to the present day including foreign works by painters who have influenced Danish art. There is a focus on Realism and on Abstract art. In addition to works by Lundstr√∏m, the Linien artists, Richard Mortensen and Robert Jacobsen, there are paintings by Asger Jorn, Ejler Bille, Ernest Mancoba and other COBRA artists. The sculpture exhibition includes works by J√∏rgen Haugen S√∏rensen, Svend Wiig Hansen and Thomas Bang. Artists from the 1980s include Christian Lemmerz, Michael Kvium, Claus Carstensen and Peter Bonde while the 1990s are illustrated by works from Christian Skeel, Morten Skriver (Skeel & Skriver), Per Bak Jensen and Nina Saunders. A number of installations have been included since the beginning of the new millennium including two large displays by Olafur Eliasson.

The complex includes three contributing buildings, one contributing site (the original formal entry drive), and two contributing structures. The historic buildings and structures are a 340,000-square-foot main plant building (1953‚Äì1955, 1960), the original water tower, water tank, a group of evolved and interconnected construction sheds built from 1953 to the present, and an airplane hangar (c. 1927). The property, a former airport, was acquired by General Electric in 1953. The Waynesboro plant was one of some 120 individual operating departments created as part of a decentralization effort by the General Electric Corporation. The Specialty Control Plant was responsible for the development of breakthrough technologies in areas ranging from America's military efforts to space travel to computer technology. The facility was sold to GENICOM on October 21, 1983. and Accompanying five photos The property was originally on General Electric Drive. After the GENICOM sale, it was renamed GENICOM Drive. In 1994, GENICOM internally reorganized into two separate companies: Enterprising Solutions Services Company (ESSC) and Document Solutions Company (GENICOM). The road north of Hopeman Parkway was renamed Solutions Way while the southern part remained GENICOM Drive at the request of property owners in that area. In 2000, GENICOM entered bankruptcy and the building was sold to the newly formed Solutions Way Management. The substantially downsized GENICOM operated as a tenant through its 2003 merger that formed TallyGenicom until a further bankruptcy and dissolution in 2009. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Solutions Way Management rents much of the facility to companies for light manufacturing, warehousing and distribution.  Background  In the early 1950s the General Electric Company was a highly centralized operation with six major manufacturing \\"works\\", as they were called. They were located in Schenectady, New York; Pittsfield, Massachusetts; Lynn, Massachusetts; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Erie, Pennsylvania; and Ft. Wayne, Indiana. At that time, under Ralph Cordiner's presidency, a major decentralization occurred whereby larger business groups were divided into individual operating departments, with new plants built in many different locations across the country. The previous Industrial Control Division, located in Schenectady, New York, was subdivided into four such departments, each of the first three with a common product line sufficient for efficient and viable operation as separate entities. The Industry Control Department, building control systems for large industry such as cranes, steel, paper, marine and submarine panels, and similar segments of industry, was located in Salem, Virginia. The General Purpose Control Department, building smaller control components such as relays and contractors for general industrial applications, was located in Bloomington, Illinois. The Appliance Control Department, building control systems for the company's consumer products; i.e., refrigerators, oil burners, and small switching devices, was located in Morrison, Illinois. The Specialty Control Department came to Waynesboro, Virginia, bringing the remaining heterogeneous components of the original Control Division, no one of which could survive as a separate entity as could the first three.  Expansion = Construction  In 1953, GE purchased the old, no longer used, Waynesboro airport, consisting of 75 acres of land located just west of the Norfolk &Western; Railroad and north of what was to become Hopeman Parkway‚Äî43 of them improved with the plant, parking lots, and finished grounds. Construction of the new plant began, and by the summer of 1954 had reached a point where production of photoelectric devices was begun with the relocation of supervisory personnel from Schenectady, and the hiring of approximately 10 women from the local area.  Planning  The original planning group that moved to Waynesboro from Schenectady in 1954 included: * Dr. L. T. Rader, General Manager * Maggy Fitzgibbons, Secretary to Mr. Rader * Ernie Hutton, Engineering * Charles Hughes, Purchasing * Cyril Lee, Planning * Joe Ponzillo, Manufacturing * Fred Curto, Buildings and Grounds * Bill Walker, Laboratory This group became the operating committee to oversee the subsequent startup and transfer of personnel to Waynesboro.  1954 - Operations Begin  In its first full year of operation, the new department hired 400 factory people, who, for the most part, had never had an industrial job before. For many it was their first job ever. Waynesboro and the surrounding area experienced a major building boom in 1955 as over 140 GE families began relocating to work in the new facility. The old apple orchard west of the city, principally the Cortland Street area, rapidly filled with new homes. Similarly, Club Court became another haven for new arrivals. Others filled many vacant lots, not only in Waynesboro, but Augusta County as well. The local families graciously welcomed the newcomers from the north, and helped to facilitate a smooth transition and assimilation into their new home. Over the next few years there were many new churches built to accommodate an expanding membership, a new hospital was built to replace a sorely out-moded facility on West Main Street, and shopping in the area underwent a major overhaul.  Area employment  Considering the years of operation and the peak employment of 3200 during the late 1970s when GE was rivaling Dupont as the largest employer in the area, the total number of employees to pass through the Waynesboro works may well match the entire population of the city. Many came and found their life's career. Others moved on through while seeking the end of their rainbow while still others, growing weary of the structured working environment, returned to their agrarian roots.  Infrastructure Renovations  The original entrance to the new plant was a narrow lane across the railroad at the north end of the property, and from US 340, the old entrance to the airport. GE had insisted that a bridge be constructed over the railroad to remove the safety hazard of many vehicles crossing the railroad each day, and this was accomplished within two years.  Product variety  The variety of products that was produced at the new location was as extensive as it was varied. Such variety attests to the incredible breadth and degree of technical and application expertise that existed throughout the first 20 years. At least one person on the staff was knowledgeable about practically every scientific phenomenon except medicine and genetics. A partial list included: * Hermetically sealed relays primarily for aerospace and military applications * Numerical Control Systems for machine tools, with input from tracers, punched tape, punched cards, magnetic tape, and digital switches. Ultimately, some were computer directed. * Thy-Mo- Trol and Statotrol adjustable speed drives for the white print industry, winding/loop control, and many others where regulated, but adjustable, speed was required * Regulators and static exciters for electrical power generation systems * Photoelectric devices for a wide range of applications, including pinhole detectors, register controls, speed, and loop controls * The marketing of selsyns (manufactured in Ft. Wayne) for remote indication and control * Hot-box detectors for detecting over-heated bearings on railroad cars * Aircraft and military products, (mostly at 400 Hz) including airborne protective panels, static exciters, regulators, military ground power supplies, regulators (navy) and amplidyne regulators, and, the power supply for the Lunar Excursion Module of the early moon probe. * Machinery Automation systems that included weighing systems, test and inspection systems, and automated material control systems * Width (thickness) gages for sheet steel using nuclear radiation. This diversity had a positive effect as the department was in a better position to weather the ups and downs of the normal business cycles that occurred over the years, requiring fewer layoffs and having a leveling effect on GE's and the local area's economic stability, than that which occurred elsewhere. The Specialty Control Department was the only GE component that had turned a profit in the first year of its move.  1958 - State Resistance to Racial Integration  In 1958, a major crisis occurred when Sen. Harry Byrd, who controlled the politics in Virginia, launched a program of massive resistance to the integration of blacks and whites, with the result that most public schools in Virginia were closed. Because 10,000 children had no means of public education, private schools began to be formed. Specialty Control felt that this was an issue that should be addressed, and after discussion with GE management most likely to be affected, Specialty Control became the GE spokesman for the effort. An association was formed in northern Virginia and Dr. Rader, representing the GE plants in Virginia, joined the organization. He gave many talks on the subject, mainly in northern Virginia, and his main point was that if the State continued with this policy, no Fortune 500 Company would locate in Virginia. It had a positive effect on the issue. It may not have been just a rumor that Dr. Rader threatened to remove the General Electric presence from Virginia. Feelings ran very high on the subject of school closings. The governor appointed a legislative committee to study the matter, and they recommended that the State cease its resistance. The recommendation was put to a vote in the Virginia Assembly and it passed by one vote. This was the first time that the GE presence in Virginia took an active part in the State's political activity.  1960: major expansion  In 1960, a major expansion took place, adding both office and manufacturing space plus a new auditorium and cafeteria to the growing facility. It also included the addition of a \\"white room\\" for the assembly of critical hermetically sealed relays. The Waynesboro GE plant grew and prospered with many new developments. Within the first decade of their arrival, existing products expanded and by the late1960's a new product line known as 'Terminet' came into being. A special development team under Kirk Snell, with John Larew, Seymour Depew and others, temporarily took over a small facility (formerly an independent used car agency) in Fishersville to develop the new product, utilizing solid-state technology and printed circuit boards, thus offering a line of printer terminals for the computer and business data field dominated primarily by Teletype. Of the 25 or so employees in that group, only one, Paul Morris, is still working in the local printer works. The belt printer technology they developed was so viable that it was shipped in printers for nearly 20 years.  Early 1970s: Division of the Specialty Control Department  In the early 1970s, the original Specialty Control Department was divided into two separate departments with the growing numerical control group becoming the Numerical Equipment Control Department. Joe Ponzillo and Warren Kindt headed these departments as General Managers, respectively. From the beginning of operations in Waynesboro, the Specialty Control Department had five general managers: Dr. Louis T. Rader, who later became Vice President of the Division. Dr. John Hutton succeeded Dr. Rader, followed by Paul Ross. Joe Ponzillo and Warren Kindt were each general managers of Specialty Control, having changed positions after the formation of the Numerical Equipment Control Department.  1979 - Move from Waynesboro to Charlottesville By 1979, GE-Waynesboro was bulging at the seams. This resulted in the transfer of the Numerical Equipment Control Department into a new facility north of Charlottesville, Virginia, where it became a part of the Manufacturing Automation Systems Division and now partnered with long-time competitor Fanuc.  Closure = Late 1960s  By the late 1960s the aircraft business had already been transferred to other GE plants located in Johnson City, New York, and Erie, Pennsylvania. By 1974, the adjustable speed drives business had been transferred to GE's plant in Erie, PA. The photoelectric business was absorbed by the General Purpose Control Department in Bloomington, Illinois, and the power systems components, consisting of static exciters and power regulators, were transferred to the Industry Control Department in Salem, VA. The residual products remaining in Specialty Control were now reduced to the Terminet printers and the relay business. The name Specialty Control now became Data Communications Products Department and, at one time, Data Communications Products Business Department.  Late 1970s  In the late 1970s, a major development was undertaken to design a non-impact printing technology to compete with laser printers. General Electric's Research and Development group in Schenectady, NY, prepared the initial concepts. A temporary satellite group of engineers continued the product development in the former Wilson building (formerly Wilson Trucking Co.) on W. Main Street across New Hope Road from the Purple Foot restaurant in Waynesboro. The new printer was to become Terminet 8000, printing 8000 lines per minute. At that time printers were operating at 300 to 600 lines per minute and were producing 6 to 9 copies (plies). In order for this new single-ply technology to compete, a speed at least ten times 600 lines per minute was adopted. The technology incorporated in it was so far ahead of its time that Product Planning and Marketing were unable to build a market for it --- and it died aborning.  Relays & High-Speed Impact Printers - The Creation of Genicom Corporation  Of the many product lines that existed in Waynesboro, two confounded the strategic planning of GE corporate management. For nearly 20 years it had predicted the perennial demise of the relay business. Likewise, in the early 1980s, as the computer businesses had been sold, it didn't see the long-term viability of high-speed impact printers. At that time the darlings of the family became unwanted children and their future was deemed uncertain, as they didn't fit anywhere in the corporate business structure. In 1981, GE made preparations to sell both the relay and the printer businesses and the management-buyout was completed in October 1983. The announcement was made to the employees on October 21. GE financed a small portion of the buyout price. A new company was formed with the name Genicom Corporation. This new venture included both relays and printers but the emphasis was to exploit the market for the printer business under the direction of Curtis Powell as CEO. Genicom ultimately sold the relay business to a firm, CII Technology, a group of venture capitalists that were combining all such manufacturers into one operation in North Carolina.. The sale was made in the early 1990s.  The Growth & Evolution of Genicom Corporation  Genicom was quite successful in its early operations, and its stock went public in 1987‚Äì8. However, as the impact printer technology began to be replaced by the laser print engine and the ink jet technology, it became more and more difficult to compete as those technologies were almost completely patented by others, and a license was required to build them. Early on, Genicom realized that just manufacturing and selling printers was not enough. It started a very successful service business a.k.a. Enterprising Service Solutions Company (ESSC) that eventually serviced all makes of printer and printer-related products. A very large warehouse for this business was built in Louisville, KY for this endeavor and much of the Waynesboro service operation moved there. Also, there were many country-specific corporations owned by Genicom across the globe. At its zenith, Genicom had $400 million in sales.  The Bankruptcy Genicom Corporation  Several attempts were made to buy/merge with others already in the field (such as Centronics, Texas Instruments, and Digital EquipmentCorporation's printer division), but these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. On March 10, 2000, Genicom declared bankruptcy. On July 17, 2001, a group of venture capitalists, Sun Capital Corporation, bought (for $9.3 million) the printer division of the bankrupt company, and its name became Genicom LLC. It was then resold in 2003 and became fragmented.  Genicom LP  A very narrow portion of the printer line continued to be built under the name Genicom LP. Northrop-Grumman Information Technology took over the parts and service of Genicom printers existing in the field under the name Genicom, PLC, and it now operates as an on-line Customer Service Center in a portion of the Waynesboro Outlet Village.  Talley-Genicom merger  A merger of Tally and the residual Genicom was announced on August 3, 2003 under the name Tally-Genicom and this new company, with manufacturing at its Mexican affiliate or by manufacturing partners, is continuing the design and manufacturing support of dot-matrix and shuttle- matrix printers in a portion of the plant formerly occupied by General Electric. Corporate headquarters still resides at Chantilly, Virginia.  Solutions Way Management  Solutions Way Management, LLC, a subsidiary of Allied Realty, Co., as part of the 2001 Genicom bankruptcy settlement, purchased the former GE property for $750,000 and now operates it as an incubator for fledgling new businesses, providing manufacturing space, and offering support services as required by the newcomers. Pollution General Electric and GENICOM manufactured circuit boards on site using a plating and etching processes that generated waste solvents. These solvents and other wastes contributed to groundwater contamination. General Electric assumed environmental responsibility for the contamination and operates a pump-and- treat system.

Attestations  Inscription of Senebmiu from Deir el-Barhi. Senebmiu is a poorly attested pharaoh. Unfortunately, the Turin canon is severely damaged after the record of Sobekhotep VII and the identity and chronological order of the last 19 kings of the 13th Dynasty is impossible to ascertain from the document.K.S.B.

Senebmiu's prenomen Sewahenre may nonetheless have been partially preserved on column 8, line 16 of the papyrus, which reads Se[...]enre. Darrell Baker and Kim Ryholt note that this attribution is far from certain as it could also correspond to another obscure king of this period with the name Sekhaenre. Otherwise, Senebmiu is attested on entry 49 of the Karnak king list, redacted during the reign of Thutmose III. Contemporary attestations of Senebmiu are few and all originate from Upper Egypt.

The entire treasure was purchased by the British Museum in 1932, where it has been on public display ever since.British Museum CollectionBritish Museum Highlights Discovery The hoard of silver objects was found by chance in 1915 at Molino de Marrubial, a suburb of the city of C√≥rdoba in the province of Andalucia, Spain. The treasure had been buried in a pit for safe- keeping, but was never retrieved by its original owners. The Cordoba Treasure eventually came into the possession of the American art collector Walter Hildburgh, who sold it to the British Museum in 1932. The treasure is one of the few Iron Age hoards from the Iberian Peninsula to be in the collection of a museum outside Spain or Portugal. Description The hoard dates from the Iron Age and was probably buried around 100 BC. Even though this part of Spain had recently been conquered to become part of the Roman Empire, the style of jewellery reflects Celtic aesthetic traditions. The silver treasure includes a large circular torc with terminals in the form of double cones, eight armlets with zoomorphic relief decoration, a brooch in the shape of two horses' heads, a conical bowl, over three hundred coins, two lumps of silver and other miscellaneous objects including rods and ingots. The coins enable archaeologists to date the treasure, as 82 of them were locally made and 222 were minted in a Roman city. Reason for burial It remains unclear why the hoard was never recovered by the person or people by whom it was buried. The large amount of silver in the treasure could have meant that its owner planned to melt it down at one stage, but for some reason was unable to. Others have suggested it could have been a votive offering, following native practices.

Both houses were demolished within a few decades of their re-building. *Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle (1653‚Äì1688), (son & heir).

He lived at Albemarle House (formerly called Clarendon House) one of the grandest of London townhouses after which was named Albemarle Street off Piccadilly in Mayfair. After the death in 1734 of his widow Lady Elizabeth Cavendish, who had re-married to Ralph Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu (1638 ‚Äì c. 1709), much of Potheridge House was demolished. Granville clarions or The ancient Grenville family (later modernised to Granville), lords of the manors of Bideford in Devon and Stowe in Cornwall, was earliest related to the Monk family through Honor Grenville (c. 1493/5-1566), wife of Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle (died 1542), KG, and mother of Frances Plantagenet, wife of Thomas Monk of Potheridge. Thomas's great-grandsons renewed the kinship to the Grenvilles through their mother Elizabeth Smith, half-sister of Grace Smith, the wife of Sir Bevil Grenville. The 1st Earl of Bath fixed the spelling of the family name to \\"Granville\\". *John Grenville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628‚Äì1701) on whom was settled a considerable part of the Monck estates by his childless cousin Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle (1653‚Äì1688). *John Granville, 1st Baron Granville of Potheridge (1665‚Äì1707) (2nd son).

The estate of Potheridge fell to the inheritance of the descendants of his aunt Jane Granville (died 1696), a daughter of the 1st Earl of Bath and wife of Sir William Leveson-Gower, 4th Baronet (c. 1647 ‚Äì 1691). Leveson-Gower clarions or (Granville)Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.505 The Leveson-Gower family, having inherited Potheridge, quickly sold it to the Rolle family of Stevenstone, great landowners in Devon. They did not however forget their Granville inheritance, and memorialised it in subsequent names and titles: Jane Granville's great-grandson was Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford (1721‚Äì1803) one of whose younger sons was Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville (1773‚Äì1846) (younger half- brother of George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland (1758‚Äì1833)), whose son was Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville (1815‚Äì1891), Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

It has also been found in the marine fungus Bionectriaceae, and belongs to a class of naturally occurring 2,5-diketopiperazines. Dideoxyverticillin A potently inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (median inhibitory concentration = 0.14 nM), exhibits antiangiogenic activity, and has efficacy against several cancer cell lines. Its reported anticancer mechanism is that it acts as a farnesyl transferase inhibitor. Dozens of semi-synthetic anticancer compounds have been made from dideoxyverticillin A. Dimeric derivatives are reported to have better anticancer activity.

The crash occurred after the aircraft had entered into a steep downward spiral during automated flight at an altitude of . The aircraft operator, Khabarovsk United Air Group, was later rebranded to Dalavia and became defunct in 2008. Background The aircraft Tupolev Tu-154B, involved in the accident, was manufactured on 30 July 1976 under a serial number 76–ê164. Prior to the accident it accumulated 30,001 flight hours and underwent four repairs, the last one on 23 September 1991. Like other former Soviet aircraft, its registration letters in the Soviet period were SSSR (–°–°–°–†); later the letters were changed to RA (–†–ê). At the time of the accident the crew consisted of captain Viktor Sumarokov, first officer Stanislav Revidovich, navigating officer Alexander Martynov, flight engineer Grigory Moroz and four flight attendants. The takeoff weight was within acceptable limits, at 82,600 kg, and the fuel weight was 15,100 kg. Crash The aircraft was cruising at (according to the investigation report; alternatively, at ) and disappeared from radar shortly after making a routine ATC report. The last contact with ATC was made on 03:00 a.m. local time (17:00 UTC). Eight minutes later the aircraft crashed into Bo-Dzhausa Mountain with a vertical speed of about 300 m/s and a pitch angle of about 70 degrees. The aircraft disintegrated into numerous fragments. The investigation listed five possible causes, whose combination might have led to the crash. It is believed that in order to counteract the left-wing low flying tendency fuel-feed was selected from left wing fuel tanks only. The fuel imbalance likely caused the aircraft to bank to the right and the autopilot was able to counteract it for 35 minutes after take-off. The crash site was found on 18 December 1995 by the crew of a Mil Mi-8 helicopter.

Following the Peace of Thorn (1411), it was taken over by the Polish, later to become a residence of the local mayor. Since the eighteenth century the castle lies in ruins. History Bobrowniki castle was erected at the turn of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, after the purchase of Bobrowniki village by the Teutonic Knights in 1392, possibly as an extension of an earlier fortress. It was located on the site of an old stronghold, founded by the Duke of Dobrzyn, Ladislaus the Hump-backed. Due to the close proximity of the country border, the elders of Dobrzy≈Ñ nad Wis≈ÇƒÖ constantly improved the fortifications around the castle, which became the seat of the local government. In 1405 Wladyslaw Jagiello purchased Dobrzyn and Bobrowniki, but four years later the Teutonic Knights attacked the castle. With the help of the treason of the defending commander Bobrowniki castle went back into Teutonic hands only to be returned to the Polish in 1411. Its border location had once again become the cause of many investments in the modernization of the facility. However, it no longer played any military role in wars to come. During the Thirteen Years' War (1454‚Äì66) the castle served as a prison for captured Knights of the Teutonic Order. Changes of the national border ultimately deprived the building of any strategic role. In the seventeenth century it was already devastated to the point of being abandoned by the local government. During the war with Sweden, in the second half of the eighteenth century, the structure was almost completely destroyed. In the nineteenth century it was formally decided to demolish the castle. The ruins do not have an owner to this day. Architecture Little is known about the appearance of the fortress at the time of the Teutonic Knights or later. The object was probably two-winged (other sources say that it was a square), surrounded by walls and a moat, with one gate and a cylindrical tower. The only remains of the past splendor of the castle are elements of fortified walls and a sentry tower.

Concert violinist and professor  Michael Schnitzler was born to Austrian parents, including his father Heinrich (1902‚Äì1982), who fled from the country after the Anschluss in 1938. He is also the grandson of the Austrian writer Arthur Schnitzler. In 1959 the family moved back to Vienna, where he studied violin at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna. At the age of 15 he played in the Vienna State Opera and the Vienna Philharmonic as a substitute, and from 1967 to 1983 he was first concertmaster of the Vienna Symphony. From 1982 to 2006 he was professor of violin at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna. Since 1968, he has been violinist of the (together with pianist Heinz Medjimorec and cellist Walther Schulz), playing over 1500 concerts and recording a substantial part of the piano trio literature.  Nature lover and conservationist  In his youth Michael Schnitzler climbed mountains in the Sierra Nevada, the Rockies and the Alps. He trekked in Peru, Nepal, Canada, and Ladakh, climbed Kilimanjaro and Cotopaxi in Ecuador, undertook safaris in Africa, went diving in the Red Sea, the Maldives, Polynesia, the Great Barrier Reef and the Caribbean, and rafted through the Grand Canyon. His travels brought him to the Galapagos Islands, the Antarctic, Greenland and various tropical countries, where he fell in love with the ecosystem \\"rainforest\\". In 1989, he purchased a small vacation house on the edge of the rainforest near Golfito in southern Costa Rica. He soon became aware of the ongoing destruction of the surrounding forests and decided to act. In 1991, the Esquinas Rainforest was declared a national park, but it was categorized as a \\"paper park\\" as long as all property was in private hands. Logging permits were in effect, and logging was continuing at a fast pace. The only way to stop this was to purchase the property and donate it to the Costa Rican government. Michael Schnitzler founded the NGO Rainforest of the Austrians with the purpose of collecting funds to buy land within the Esquinas forest. Soon, his voluntary work as a conservationist took up more time than his profession as a musician. Rainforest of the Austrians has since raised more than $3,000,000 and purchased 10,000 acres of rainforest, which were donated to the Costa Rican government to become part of Piedras Blancas National Park.

NISS During the Omar al-Bashir presidency, the National Intelligence and Security Service was an incredibly powerful body. It was granted extensive powers by the National Security Acts of 1999 and 2010 and was frequently referred to as a secret police organization. It is widely accepted that in addition to its domestic operations, NISS ran operations and agents throughout the Middle East, North Africa and Western Europe. The secretive organisation's most well known operation was its massive intelligence network in Iraq, which it was able to build by recruiting foreign fighters passing through Khartoum on their way to Iraq. From 2004 to 2009, NISS was led by Salah Gosh. Gosh was removed as leader by President Al-Bashir and replaced with Mohammed Atta al-Moula, the deputy director of the service at the time, who led it until Gosh's reappointment in 2018. The NISS operated the Rapid Support Forces. On 13 April 2019 during the 2019 Sudanese coup d'√©tat, Gosh, who was reappointed NISS Director in 2018 and was a controversial figure, was sacked as head of the agency after Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan, the head of the newly created Transitional Military Council (TMC) accepted his resignation. On 14 April 2019, Lieutenant General Abu Bakr Mustafa was named as Gosh's successor. Creation of GIS NISS was heavily involved in the repression of protestors during the Sudanese Revolution of 2018‚Äì2019, in response to which protestors called for NISS to be dissolved. While the TMC still held power as the de facto executive power in Sudan, in July, it issued Constitutional Decree No. (33) of 2019, in which NISS was renamed as the General Intelligence Service. Official reasons cited for the name change included \\"[coping] with the political change in the country\\" and \\"[becoming] more professional in protecting the country and safeguarding its national security against very complicated threats\\". January 2020 mutiny According to The Washington Post, most of the former NISS agents chose neither to remain in GIS nor to accept the option to join alternative Sudanese armed services, and instead to accept a monetary package. The initially proposed value of the severance pay was around and was later reduced to around . On 14 January 2020, several of the former NISS agents, angry at the reduced value of the severance, mutinied. Government security forces regained control of the rebelling former NISS employees within several hours. Hemetti of the Sovereignty Council attributed responsibility for the mutiny to former NISS head Salah Gosh, and stated that the mutiny should not be considered to be a coup attempt. The Washington Post interpreted the incident as \\"probably a haphazard show of anger by frustrated corps members who are now out of a job, rather than an attempt to overthrow the regime.\\" The head of GIS, Abu Bakr Mustafa, resigned as a result of the event.

Born in New York, he came to Illinois with his brother John Charles and established one of the first villages in Lake County, Hainesville. Admitted to the bar in 1851, Haines wrote several notable law books. He was first elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1858 and served eight intermittent terms, including two as Speaker of the House. Staunchly independent after 1865, Haines was a leader in the movement against the Republican Party in Illinois before his death in 1889. Biography Elijah Middlebrook Haines was born on April 21, 1822, in Oneida County, New York. When he was twelve years old, he moved west with his brother John Charles and settled in Lake County, Illinois. In 1846, he surveyed, platted, and named the town of Hainesville. Haines taught school in nearby Waukegan while he studied law; he was admitted to the bar in 1851. He opened a law office in and starting writing about the subject. His first major work, A Compilation of the Laws of Illinois relating to Township Organization was first published in 1855. He also wrote similar books on other states, including Wisconsin (1858), Michigan (1860) and Minnesota (1869). In 1868, he published A Practical Treatise on the Powers and Duties of Justices of the Peace and Constables in the State of Illinois. The two Illinois books became popular among those studying law in the state. Early in his life, Haines voted with the Democratic Party. However, in 1859, he left the party over the slavery issue and joined the Republican Party. Haines was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1858 and was re-elected to two more two- year terms. However, he increasingly found himself at odds with party ideals. In 1865, he renounced the Republican Party and aligned himself with the Andrew Johnson movement. Haines became active in the anti-monopoly movement, attempting to break up large chains of warehouses. Still a popular figure in the state, Haines was elected as an independent delegate to the 1870 Illinois constitutional convention. There, Haines galvanized opposition to the Republican Party, allowing minority parties to influence the legislation as a combined majority. These actions led to his re-election to the Illinois House in 1870 and again in 1874. During this latter term, Haines was named Speaker of the House. He served again as a standard member of the House in 1882, then was again named Speaker in 1884, serving until 1886. During this term, he presided over the contentious 1885 US Senate election. He was once again elected to the House in 1888, but died on April 25, 1889 before his term was complete. He was buried in Cranberry Lake Cemetery.

Pilcher spent his early career as an infantry officer, first seeing active service on colonial campaigns in Nigeria in the late 1890s followed by field command in the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902), on which he published a book of lessons learned in 1903. Following the war, he held a number of senior commands in India. However, further promotion was checked by his having come into conflict with his commander-in-chief, who regarded him as unsuited for senior command in part because of his writings; Pilcher was a keen student of the German army and its operational methods, and an active theorist who published a number of controversial books advocating the adoption of new military techniques as well as an anonymous invasion novel. On the outbreak of the First World War he was on leave in England, and eventually obtained the command of 17th (Northern) Division, a New Army volunteer unit. The division supported the initial attacks at the Battle of the Somme in July 1916, where Pilcher again clashed with his superiors over his refusal to push on an attack without pausing for preparations, believing it would result in failure and heavy casualties. After ten days of fighting, Pilcher was sacked and sent to command a reserve centre in England. From here, he wrote a series of books before retiring in 1919. He ran as a parliamentary candidate for the splinter right-wing National Party in the 1918 general election, and continued a loose involvement with right-wing politics which extended to membership in the early British Fascisti. Pilcher had married Kathleen Gonne, daughter of a cavalry officer, in 1889; the marriage was strained, partly through Pilcher's gambling habits and adultery, and partly through his dislike for Maud Gonne, Kathleen's sister and a prominent Irish nationalist. The couple divorced in 1911, having had four children; one would later become a High Court judge, while another died on the Western Front in 1915. Pilcher remarried in 1913, and remained married to his second wife Millicent until his death in 1928. Early career A group of British and Australian mounted infantry officers, circa 1900, including Pilcher (seated centre, with pith helmet) Pilcher was born in Rome in 1858, the son of Thomas Webb Pilcher, of Harrow, and his wife, Sophia (n√©e Robinson). He was the eldest of five children (four surviving infancy); his younger brother, Percy, would go on to become a pioneering aeronautical engineer, assisted by their sister Ella who undertook the fabric work on the aircraft's wings. Pilcher was educated at Harrow School, but after his father died in October 1874, he left the school the following year (aged 17).The Harrow School register, 1800-1911, p. 477 Following his father's death, in an attempt to save money on living expenses, his mother took the family to live in Celle, where she herself died in 1877. Thomas brought his three younger siblings home, and entered the Army, commissioned in the Dublin City Artillery Militia in August 1878.London Gazette, 27 September 1878 Commissions in the Militia were often used as a stepping-stone to a regular commission, and Pilcher rapidly transferred out, first to the 22nd Regiment of Foot, London Gazette, 20 June 1879 then almost immediately to the 5th Fusiliers (later the Northumberland Fusiliers).London Gazette, 1 July 1879 After a period of regimental service, Pilcher attended the Staff College, Camberley, passing the course in 1892, and from 1895 to 1897 was appointed as the deputy assistant adjutant-general for Dublin District. in \\"Lions Led by Donkeys\\", Birmingham Centre for First World War Studies. (Archived from the original, 2007) From here, he took a posting in colonial West Africa in the late 1890s, where he was involved in raising a battalion of the West African Frontier Force and commanded an expedition to Lapai and Argeyah. In 1899 Pilcher transferred regiments for the third time, to the Bedfordshire Regiment, where he took command of the 2nd Battalion. It served in the Second Boer War from 1899 to 1902, during which time Pilcher was also given command of a column of mounted infantry, including a large contingent of Australians. He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 20 October 1900, and to colonel on 29 November 1900, and in 1901 he was made an aide-de-camp to King Edward VII. During early 1902 he was stationed in the Orange River Colony, operating from Boshof, and later assisted in convoying supplies to garrisons west of Kimberley in Cape Colony. Following the end of the war, he returned to the United Kingdom in early June 1902. For his services during the war, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) on 29 November 1900, but was not invested until he was back in England, by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 8 August 1902. He commanded regular brigades at Aldershot from 1902 to 1907. From here, he was posted to India, where he held a variety of commands, culminating in that of the Burma Division, the senior military officer in the colony, from 1912 to 1914. From 1914 to 1928 he was Colonel of the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment. At the time of the outbreak of war, though still holding the Burmese posting, he was on leave in England. Personal life and writing In 1889, Pilcher married Kathleen Mary Gonne, daughter of Colonel Thomas Gonne of the 17th Lancers;\\"PILCHER, Maj.-Gen. Thomas David\\", in Who Was Who (2007). Online edition her sister, Maude Gonne, later became a prominent Irish nationalist and mother of the politician and Nobel laureate Se√°n MacBride, as well as a close associate and muse of W. B. Yeats. Pilcher disapproved of his sister-in- law, particularly after her marriage to John MacBride, and relations were frequently strained; however, the two sisters remained close. The couple would have a daughter, Thora, and three sons ‚Äì Toby, Tommy, and Pat. The elder son, Gonne (\\"Toby\\", to his family), became a Judge of the High Court of Justice,\\"PILCHER, Sir Gonne (St Clair)\\", in Who Was Who (2007). Online edition while Tommy would be killed at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915, aged 21.Casualty details: PILCHER, THOMAS PERCY, Commonwealth War Graves Commission Pilcher's marriage was not a happy one; a gambler and womaniser, he expected his independently wealthy wife to bail out his debts and turn a blind eye to his mistresses. The two gradually drifted into separate lives, and after finally confronted with an affair becoming public, Kathleen sued for divorce. The precipitating event was Pilcher having been named as co-respondent in a divorce suit; it was alleged that he had committed adultery with Millicent Knight-Bruce, the wife of Major James Knight-Bruce. The case dragged on through 1910, delayed by Pilcher's inability to return from India to attend the court.. Full names taken from National Archives file J 77/984/9879. Pilcher did not contest his wife's suit, and his own divorce was granted in 1911; he married Millicent, now divorced, in 1913. Pilcher was a particularly active observer of the German army, studying their military methods and attending German army manoeuvres. He would later publish a translation of Clausewitz. His writing was sometimes controversial, beginning with the 1896 Artillery from an Infantry Officer's Point of View, in which he argued strongly in favour of adopting indirect fire techniques from concealed locations. Conventional doctrine held that artillery should be used to fire directly on its targets, as much from principle as from practical effect, with one prominent artillerist arguing that \\"firing from cover ... will destroy the whole spirit of the arm\\". The argument ran for two years. As well as provoking debate, his writing proved problematic for his career; in part because of a 1907 pamphlet, Fire Problems, he was twice blocked for promotion by the Commander-in-Chief India. In it, he had encouraged the development of machine- gun tactics, and much heavier concentration and use of the weapons, an unusual position for the pre-war period. In 1906, Pilcher had also published an anonymous invasion novel, The Writing on the Wall, which described a German invasion of Britain; The war he theorised was an invasion by Germany followed by a rapid collapse of the British forces, particularly the volunteers, which he saw as unfit for purpose; he advocated a form of conscription and a mandatory reserve system to strengthen the Army. The Spectator was dismissive, comparing the novel unfavourably to The Invasion of 1910 (\\"many useful hints are given as to practical lessons ... [but] the general plot entirely destroys any value it might otherwise possess\\") and noting that the suggestions were \\"highly typical\\", but that it was counterproductive to simply malign the Army and encourage the country to adopt German military policies. It was translated and published in Germany the same year, as Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin: Englands √ºberw√§ltigung durch Deutschland. First World War At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 Pilcher was on leave in England, and offered his services to the War Office, but was initially turned down as unsuitable for command by Sir John French; however, in January 1915 he was appointed to command the newly formed 17th (Northern) Division, a New Army division predominantly drawn from northern England. The division moved to France in July 1915, where it held a sector near Ypres for the remainder of the year. It fought in an action at St. Eloi in March 1916, following which Douglas Haig considered relieving Pilcher of his command ‚Äì he was not highly rated by his superior officers ‚Äì but in the end his corps commander, Hew Fanshawe, was sacked instead. Pilcher was perceived by many as old-fashioned and disengaged, rarely visiting the trenches; the journalist Philip Gibbs remarked on his \\"courteous old-fashioned dignity and gentleness of manner\\", but concluded simply that \\"modern warfare was too brutal for him\\". Pilcher's command was certainly slack; an observer in the summer of 1916, recently appointed to 17th Division as a staff officer, recalled finding a completely disorganised unit, with no central co-ordination, no effective provision of laundry or comforts for front-line units, and described the divisional staff as simply \\"of no value\\". The 17th was deployed for the Battle of the Somme in July. It was engaged on the first day of the Somme, 1 July, where it supported the capture of Fricourt and lost 1,155 men killed or wounded. Following this, it was involved in the capture of Contalmaison and the capture of Mametz, and had taken a total of 4,771 casualties by the time it was relieved on 11 July. Many of these casualties stemmed from an unsuccessful attack on the \\"Quadrangle Trench Support\\" on 7 July; the division had captured the main trench system on 5 July and Pilcher ordered it to pause and prepare for a subsequent assault. However, he was over-ruled by higher command, who forced an attack the next night ‚Äì which failed ‚Äì followed by a daylight attack on 7 July, which Pilcher strongly protested but eventually acquiesced in. He ordered an attack with the minimal number of men necessary, assuming it would inevitably be doomed to failure and high casualties, which outraged his superiors. Pilcher later wrote that \\"It is very easy to sit a few miles in the rear and get credit for allowing men to be killed in an undertaking foredoomed to failure, but the part did not appeal to me and my protests against these useless attacks were not well received.\\" Following the division's withdrawal, Pilcher was promptly sacked by his corps commander, Henry Horne, along with the commander of the neighbouring 38th (Welsh) Division; Horne considered him lacking in \\"initiative, drive, and readiness\\", while Haig simply dismissed him as \\"unequal to the task\\" of divisional command. Pilcher was succeeded by Philip Robertson on 13 July 1916. He was later appointed to command the Eastern Reserve Centre at St. Albans, and retired from the Army in 1919. Later life Following the end of the war, Pilcher contested the seat of Thornbury in the 1918 general election. He opposed the sitting Liberal member Athelstan Rendall, a Coalition Coupon candidate, representing the splinter right-wing National Party of Conservatives opposed to the Coalition. He was heavily defeated, taking only 38% of the vote in what had previously been a relatively close seat. He continued a loose association with right-wing politics, chairing the anti-Bolshevik National Security Union, and joining the anti- socialist and protectionist British Commonwealth Union. When the British Fascisti was formed in the early 1920s, Pilcher became a member and an official of its London branch. Pilcher died in 1928, aged 70, of pneumonia. He was survived by his second wife.

The establishments complemented libraries in that they stocked the daily newspapers, periodicals, pamphlets, novels and other new publications that public libraries lacked. The ‚Äòcabinets de lecture‚Äô also remained open from the morning through to the evening, and so for studious members of the public they offered inexpensive shelter, warmth, light and education. The first reading rooms in Paris The number of reading rooms increased as the desire to read and study politics spread. Before the Revolution, there were only book lenders, somewhere to add books to a collection but not somewhere the public went to read. The reader had to pay a small fee as an insurance against the book which they were taking away. This cost was too expensive for most people and therefore alienated many readers. With the development of reading rooms, it became possible, for a small amount of money, to spend the whole day in a well-decorated, heated and lit room, whilst having at your disposal the necessary books for serious study or mental development. In many reading rooms, the clientele consisted mostly of literate individuals who were unable to purchase books and periodicals on a regular basis. This clientele included professionals, teachers, skilled artisans, and small merchants.Cabinet de lecture des chiffonniers de Madame Lec≈ìur (Cit√© Dor√©).

As well as attending French political societies (known as clubs), those involved in politics would also visit the cabinets, where ‚Äì for a small fee ‚Äì they were able to read newspapers and pamphlets in small booths, or the wide array of newly published pieces of literature that were spread over the tables. Often at the cabinets, as with at the clubs, coffee houses, salons and bookshops, serious discussions would break out. People argued, hurled abuse and fought one another over specific facts in order to attack or defend the public figures being discussed. Whether by the light of a lantern or a simple oil lamp, people came to feed their political appetite and to leave better prepared for the debates that took place in the street. For this reason, the majority of the cabinets were located at the Palais-Royal in central Paris. Among them was Gattey‚Äôs, which published Rivarol and Champcenetz's satirical, anti-revolutionary pamphlet, Les Actes des Ap√¥tres (in English: The Acts of the Apostles). Bravely, Gattey kept his establishment open during the Revolution, despite the dangerous name with which his cabinet was often associated: ‚ÄúThe Aristocrats‚Äô Den‚Äù.

Some closely fit the concept of a tribe. Others are confederations or even unions of tribes. Overview Before the Roman conquest in the 3rd century BC, the islands of Corsica and Sardinia were inhabited by three main peoples or ethnic groups, the Corsi, the Balares, and the Ilienses, each of them divided into several tribes. With the Roman conquest, the province of Sardinia and Corsica was created, becoming the second province of the Roman Republic to be created after that of Sicily. The ethnic and linguistic affiliation (Paleo-Sardinian language) of the Nuragic people and tribes remains to be further studied, moreover \\"Nuragic\\" might have also been a geographical and historical name designating different peoples and languages, rather than indicating a single origin. Current knowledge indicates that they may have been related to the Iberians and the ancient Basque: these peoples were Pre-Indo-Europeans and spoke Pre-Indo-European languages, Proto-Basque (the ancestor of modern Basque) and Iberian.Eduardo Blasco Ferrer, Paleosardo. Le radici linguistiche della Sardegna neolitica, Berlin/New York (2010) There is also the possibility that the Nuragic peoples may have been related to the Etruscans and other Tyrsenian peoples and languages.La lingua dei Sardi Nuragici e degli Etruschi - Massimo Pittau One of the Sea Peoples (the Shardana or Sherden) may have been either a population hailing from Sardinia (Ugas 2005, 2016) or a group of tribes that migrated to the island in the Late Bronze Age (Sandars 1978). If the Corsi, dwelling in Corsica and in the northernmost tip of Sardinia (Gallura), were a subset of the Ligurians and a group of tribes (they probably were an Indo-European people related to the Celts), then they would have been of a different ethnic and linguistic affiliation from the majority of the tribes of Sardinia (although Emidio De Felice found similarities between Paleo-Sardinian and Ancient LigurianMary Carmen Iribarren Argaiz, Los vocablos en-rr-de la lengua sarda: Conexiones con la pen√≠nsula ib√©rica).

Her installations are composed using a variety of natural materials including terracotta, sand, copper, recycled stone, glass, wood and coal. Her works often focus on the history and culture of African Americans in the southern United States. In her exhibition at the Corcoran, Jarvis featured over 100 big collard green leaves, numerous carp and an live Potomac catfish.

Residing on the planet Karn, the Sisterhood was introduced in the 1976 serial The Brain of Morbius, and later appearing in the 2013 mini episode \\"The Night of the Doctor\\" and the 2015 episodes \\"The Magician's Apprentice\\" and \\"Hell Bent\\". They are the guardians and worshippers of the Sacred Flame, which provides for them the Elixir of Life and thus grants them immortality. They are in some way related to, and affiliated with, the Time Lords, the species of which the show's protagonist, the Doctor, is a member. Backstory In The Brain of Morbius, details of Sisterhood's religious practices are abundant and much is made of their tempestuous relationships with other species. They are led by Maren, already old at the Elixir's discovery, and worship the \\"Sacred Flame\\", which furnishes them with the \\"Elixir of Life\\" and provides them with their mighty power, thus it fades when they are away from the flame. Only the Time Lords, with whom they have shared the Elixir since the \\"Time of the Stones\\", parallel them in mental ability; while other races they can \\"destroy from within\\", the Time Lords can resist their influence ‚Äì a strength which allows Morbius to reside on Karn undetected. The Time Lords themselves use their Elixir sparingly, only, for example, if they encounter difficulty when regenerating. The flame itself is, according to the Doctor, the product of gases rising from the molten core of the planet up to the surface through a geological fault, and thus is to burn for millions of years. Apparently, the Elixir tastes of \\"stewed apricots ‚Äì no custard\\". They are revealed to have become paranoid after their betrayal by Morbius, who, having promised immortality to his followers, laid waste to Karn in search of their life-giving Elixir. It is further revealed that prior to Morbius' revelation, only the High Council of the Time Lords knew of the Elixir and that, since their betrayal, the Sisters have been using their considerable mental powers to crash passing spacecraft onto the surface of Karn for fear of their taking the Sacred Flame. Over a year prior to the events of The Brain of Morbius, the Flame, clogged with soot, began to fade and Elixir stopped being produced and so, by the time of the main events of the episode, Maren has for months been attempting to rekindle the flame with powdered rineweed. By the time of the 2013 mini- episode \\"The Night of the Doctor\\", the Sisterhood has \\"elevated\\" \\"Time Lord science\\" so that not only can their elixir trigger regeneration, but different potions can be prepared which can cause specific changes in the Time Lord's new body. The Eighth Doctor uses this upgraded elixir to save himself and consciously opts to become \\"a warrior\\", regenerating into the War Doctor.https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/ However, in his novelisation of the story, Steven Moffat explains the sisters gave the Doctor lemonade, lying about the elixir to convince him to regenerate into a warrior. The Sisterhood is able to prevent Colony Sarff, an agent of Davros, from separating into his individual components and attacking them (\\"The Magician's Apprentice\\"). Whether this is due to the atmosphere of Karn or their own mental powers is unrevealed.  TV appearances  In the serial The Brain of Morbius, the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) is accused of being sent by the Time Lords to steal the Elixir. The Doctor denies this, saying that the last thing he remembers is having wine with Solon and Morbius, but Morbius is dead, executed by the Time Lords on Karn for leading a rebellion. His body was placed in a dispersal chamber and atomised. The Doctor realises that just before he passed out, he felt the mind of Morbius. The Sisters refuse to believe that Morbius is alive and says that the Doctor will join him in death shortly. The Sisters gather wood to burn the Doctor at the stake. The Doctor points out that the Time Lords have always been friendly to the Sisterhood ‚Äî they saved them when Morbius overran the planet. The Sisters are unconvinced, and they tie the Doctor to the stake while chanting the Song of Death. At the last moment, the Doctor is rescued by his companion Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen), and makes his way to safety. After the Doctor re-kindles the Sacred Flame and deals with Morbius, he is reconciled with the Sisterhood, and they part amicably. In the mini-episode \\"The Night of the Doctor\\", the mortally-injured Eighth Doctor (Paul McGann) is taken in by the Sisterhood of Karn, who revive him temporarily. The Sisterhood's leader, Ohila (Clare Higgins), offers the Doctor a selection of potions which, if consumed before he expires, will not only trigger his regeneration into a new form, but allow him to choose which characteristics his next incarnation will have. They convince the Doctor that he must take action to end the Time War, which \\"threatens all reality\\". The Doctor's initial rejection is met by the response that he is \\"dead already; how many more will you let join you?\\", and the Sisters beg him not to allow the universe to fall, as it presently \\"stands on the brink\\". The Doctor acknowledges there is not much need for a doctor any more, salutes the memory of his past companions, and asks for a potion that will turn him into \\"a warrior\\". He utters his last words (\\"Physician, heal thyself\\") and, after drinking it, regenerates into a new incarnation, known as the War Doctor (John Hurt), who declares, \\"Doctor no more.\\" Karn and Ohila, the head of the Sisterhood, reappear in the 2015 mini-prologue to the Twelfth Doctor story \\"The Magician's Apprentice\\". Ohila tells the Doctor that someone is searching for him. The Doctor states he will confront his pursuer and gives Ohila his \\"confession dial\\" ‚Äì a Time Lord's last will and testament ‚Äì knowing she knows whom to deliver it to. Karn and the Sisterhood also appear, hiding the Doctor, in the broadcast episode itself. Davros' agent Colony Sarff tries to attack the Sisterhood, but his powers are neutralised on Karn, and he retreats. When the Doctor returns to Gallifrey in \\"Hell Bent\\", the Sisterhood appear unannounced in the High Council of Gallifrey's chamber to tell Rassilon (Donald Sumpter) that the Doctor blames only him for the horrors of the Time War. Ohila is dismayed as the Doctor flees Gallifrey with his companion Clara (Jenna Coleman) in an attempt to cheat her death.  Audio dramas  The Sisterhood of Karn also feature in the Big Finish Productions audio dramas Zagreus and the two-part story Sisters of the Flame/Vengeance of Morbius.

In the opening lines, its voice over narrative discusses the lake and sets the stage for the piece. According to the artist's website, \\"This report is about a lake, and about longing. Also about greed, and about ways of bearing witness. I don't know the whole story, one never does.\\" VeraFrenkel.com Awards Frenkel is recipient of the 1989 Canada Council Molson Prize, the 1994 Toronto Arts Foundation Visual Arts Award, the 1993 Gershon Iskowitz Prize, the 1999 Bell Canada Award for Video Art and the 2007 iDMAa Pioneering Achievement Award.

Eric Brand Butler-Henderson (26 September 1884 ‚Äì 18 December 1953) was the seventh child of Alexander Henderson, 1st Baron Faringdon, and the great-grandfather of Vicki (born 1972) and Charlie Butler-Henderson. He was a soldier and company director, who was honoured when a steam locomotive was named after him. Biography Born Eric Brand Henderson on 26 September 1884 at Norwood Green in Middlesex, the son of Alexander and Jane Henderson, his father was a stock broker.1891 Census of Faringdon, RG12/107, Page 3, Eric Brand Henderson. Buscot Park, Buscot, Aged: 6 Where Born:Norwood Green, Middlesex. He was schooled at Eton College. He married Sophia Isabelle Butler Massey (known as Zo√´) on 10 December 1910, and on 21 December 1910 used a deed poll to legally change his name to Eric Brand Butler-Henderson. They had six children: Lionel (born 1911); Patrick (born 1913); Mary (born 1915); Edward (born 1916); Doreen (born 1920); and Kenneth (born 1929). His eldest son Lionel Butler-Henderson raced cars for Frazer Nash in the 1930s; Lionel's second child Guy (born 1948) raced in the British Karting team; and two of Guy's children, Vicki (born 1972) and Charlie (born 1978), also became accomplished motor racing drivers. By 1926, Eric Butler-Henderson was living at Winwick Manor, Rugby; in that year he was appointed one of the Sheriffs of Northamptonshire; in 1927 he was again appointed Sheriff for that county, and once again in 1928, but in 1929 was appointed High Sheriff of Northamptonshire. Eric Butler-Henderson was appointed a Commander of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem (C.St.J.) on 20 December 1937. He died in Andover district of Hampshire on 18 December 1953, aged 69.General Register Office index of deaths registered in October, November, December 1953 ‚Äì Name: Henderson, Eric B.B. Age: 69 District: Andover, Hampshire Volume: 6B Page: 61. Army career He was appointed to the Berkshire Imperial Yeomanry (as a second lieutenant) on 30 March 1908 and (when the Territorial Force was formed), transferred to the Berkshire (Hungerford) Yeomanry with a number of other officers on 1 April 1908, retaining his rank. He was promoted to temporary captain on 9 April 1915, and achieved the rank of Captain on 20 December 1915. As part of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force he was reported as wounded in 1915. He transferred from the Yeomanry to the Territorial Force Reserve on 6 November 1917, as a Captain. He relinquished his Territorial Army Reserve commission on 30 September 1921, retaining his rank of Captain but not the right to wear the uniform. Railways In May 1918, Butler-Henderson was elected a Director of the Great Central Railway (GCR), where his father, Lord Faringdon, was chairman of the board. Like other GCR Directors of the period, he was accorded the honour of having one of the railway's latest express passenger locomotives named after him: no. 506, the first locomotive of GCR Class 11F, was named Butler‚ÄìHenderson when it entered service on 27 December 1919. Butler-Henderson was the last new Director of the GCR; at the start of 1923, the GCR amalgamated with several other railways to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), and Butler-Henderson was one of four GCR nominees who became Directors of the LNER, his appointment being confirmed on 17 November 1922. He remained a Director of the LNER until at least 1930. Locomotive no. 506 was also inherited by the LNER, and it latterly bore numbers 5506 (from June 1924), 2660 (from October 1946) and finally 62660 (from October 1949). It remained in service with the LNER and its successor, British Railways, until October 1960. After it was withdrawn from service, it was selected for preservation, being restored during 1961. It is part of the National Collection, and is on loan to Barrow Hill Engine Shed, where it is on static display. He was a director of Catalinas Warehouses and Mole Co. Ltd., resigning upon the appointment of liquidators on 27 October 1953. ReferencesExternal links *Hon.

Career=Avalanche Magazine In 1968, B√©ar co-founded and edited Avalanche magazine with Willoughby Sharp, producing thirteen issues between 1970 and 1976. Avalanche explored conceptual art and other new forms of art making, such as performance art and land art, from the artist's perspective and featured interviews with artists done by either B√©ar, Sharp, or both of the editors together, documenting artists' work and news and avoiding criticism as a matter of editorial policy. Among the artists featured in early editions of Avalanche magazine were Vito Acconci, Lawrence Weiner, Joseph Beuys, Gordon Matta-Clark and Yvonne Rainer. Avalanche was also influential in its design.Ebony, David (October 2010). \\"An Art History: Avalanche\\". Art in America. B√©ar was especially attuned to the possibilities of the interview as an artistic form in its own right. For example, in her interview with Joel Shapiro in Avalanche 12, she conceived of the conversation through the narrative and formal devices of film. Telecommunications In 1977 she collaborated with Keith Sonnier and several other artists to stage the two-day project Send/Receive Satellite Network, an interactive video link set up via a NASA satellite between participants in New York City and San Francisco. The live feed was relayed directly by infrared link to via Manhattan public access cable in New York, and to a Bay Area public access station. In 1978‚Äì79, following the Send/Receive project, B√©ar pioneered the use of Slow Scan and QWIP technology as a means to continue interactive visual exchanges between individual artists and artist groups, but using the phone lines rather than a satellite connection. The largest of these demonstrations included eleven cities in the United States and Canada. Among the participating artist groups in New York City was Collaborative Projects (originally named the Green Corporation) of which B√©ar was a founding member with forty to fifty other artists. From 1979 ‚Äì 1991 B√©ar co-founded the artist public access television show Communications Update / Cast Iron TV, which showed on Manhattan Cable's Channel D.Ingram, Julie. \\"An Enchanted Evening: A Q&A; With Video Pioneers Liza B√©ar and Milly Iatrou\\", The Huffington Post, Retrieved 12 October 2014. The show debuted as the 10-week series \\"The WARC Report\\", providing coverage of the 1979 World Administrative Radio Conference at which frequencies were allocated for various uses of the spectrum by broadcast and other technologies. The series included a Slow Scan feed from Geneva, Switzerland as well as live studio interviews with telecommunications experts. Of the WARC report programs, Rachel Wetzler has written that they \\"were fundamentally concerned with the intermingling of governmental, corporate, and military interests that determined and regulated access to information on a global scale.\\" The show continued uninterruptedly on Manhattan Cable's access channel but changed its name to Communications Update and diversified its focus to include experimental programs by artists and filmmakers, including satire and comedy. Films Beginning in 1978 with Souk El Arba, B√©ar has made a number of films in formats ranging from Super 8 to 35mm. They include the shorts Oued Nefifik: A Foreign Movie (1982), a post-colonial comedy of manners, Lost Oasis, Earthglow and the feature film Force of Circumstance (1989), a political intrigue set in Casablanca and Washington DC, starring Boris Major, Eric Mitchell, Jessica Stutchbury and Tom Wright.

Born in Antwerp, he began his career with Royal Antwerp before moving to their English sister club, Manchester United, in 2010. Having failed to break into the first-team, he was loaned to Carlisle United in January 2014, before making a permanent move back to Belgium with Zulte Waregem in July 2014.  Club career Born in Antwerp, Ekangamene began his career with local club Royal Antwerp. As a result of the club's partnership with Manchester United, Ekangamene went on trial with the English club twice in late 2008 before agreeing in March 2009 to join them permanently once he turned 16 in February 2010. He made his debut for the Manchester United reserves on 26 April 2010, coming on for Michael Keane in the 76th minute of a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Wigan Athletic. The following season, he was a regular in the under-18s, making 18 appearances out of a possible 28, as well as appearing three times for the reserves, including one start in the Manchester Senior Cup ‚Äì a 6‚Äì1 win over Rochdale on 3 February 2011. Ekangamene continued in the under-18s the following season, and scored his first goal for Manchester United on 5 November 2011 in a 2‚Äì1 win over Bolton Wanderers. His only reserve team appearance of the season came in the semi-finals of the Lancashire Senior Cup against Blackpool on 1 May 2012; the match went to a penalty shoot-out after it finished goalless in normal time, and Ekangamene scored the winning penalty with a delicate chip over the diving goalkeeper to put Manchester United through to the final. In 2012‚Äì13, Ekangamene graduated to the reserves on a full-time basis, and was again a regular in the side, playing 19 times in all competitions; he also scored his first goal for the reserves on 20 March 2013, getting the opening goal in the 40th minute of a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Arsenal. After making 13 appearances in the first half of the 2013‚Äì14 season, on 31 January 2014, Ekangamene and teammate Sam Byrne were loaned to Carlisle United. He made his professional debut the next day, starting the game against Bristol City. Although the loan was due to last until the end of the season, a lack of centre-backs meant Manchester United were forced to recall Ekangamene to play in an unfamiliar position after only a month. After his return, he was ever-present for the under-21s and even scored in their penalty shoot-out defeat by Bolton Wanderers in the quarter- finals of the Lancashire Senior Cup on 17 March 2014. His performances during the season led to a nomination for the Denzil Haroun Reserve Player of the Year award, but he was ultimately beaten in the fan vote by Saidy Janko. On 11 July 2014, Ekangamene left Manchester United to join Belgian club Zulte Waregem on a four-year deal.

Many ecoventions bear tendencies similar to public works projects such as sewage and waste-water treatment plants, public gardens, landfills, mines, and sustainable building projects.http://greenmuseum.org/c/ecovention/sect1.html#landart Greenmuseum.org Ecoventions The term 'Ecovention' appears by the composition of the terms 'ecology' and 'innovation' or 'intervention'. The intention was to concrete a kind of art that alludes to the interventions that artists were made in degraded natural territories, pretending to generate a public consciousness, showing the existence of solutions. The fact of restoring make the artists enter in a collaboration process with the nature in a social way. They help to generate a new paradigm teaching how art could help the society not only in a social or political criticism, but getting directly involved in the world. They are responsible for extending the various environmental principles and practices to the community. Artists will focus on various aspects like: biological, cultural, political or historical. At the same time, different professionals work that are fundamental; architects, botanists, zoologists, engineers, ecologists... all based on the imaginative idea of an artist 4\\\\.

December 25, 936Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280.Academia Sinica Chinese-Western Calendar Converter.), courtesy name Zhitong (ÂøóÈÄö), nickname Shengtie (ÁîüÈêµ, \\"raw iron\\"), was a general of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period state Later Tang. At the end of Later Tang, when Shi Jingtang rebelled against Later Tang's last emperor Li Congke, Zhang commanded the Later Tang army against Shi, but was defeated by the joint forces of Shi and Emperor Taizong of Liao. His deputy Yang Guangyuan then killed him and surrendered, leading to Later Tang's fall.  Background and service under Li Cunxu  It is not known when Zhang Jingda was born, but it is known that his family was from Dai Prefecture (‰ª£Â∑û, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi). His father Zhang Shen () was known to be a ferocious warrior, and served as an officer under the major late-Tang Dynasty warlord Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), who carried the title of Prince of Jin. After Li Keyong's death ‚Äî by which time Tang had fallen and Li Keyong ruled his own state of Jin ‚Äî Zhang Shen continued to serve under Li Keyong's son and successor Li Cunxu.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 70. In 923, Li Cunxu declared himself the emperor of a new Later Tang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. Shortly after, Zhang Shen died, while still serving in the army ‚Äî possibly in battle. By that point, Zhang Jingda was already known for his riding and archery skills. Li Cunxu heard this, and summoned him, giving him his father's old position. After Li Cunxu subsequently successfully destroyed archrival Later Liang and took over its territory, Zhang Jingda was given an honorary minister title.  Service under Li Siyuan  Li Cunxu was killed in a mutiny at the capital Luoyang in 926, and Li Cunxu's adoptive brother Li Siyuan became emperor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Zhang Jingda continued to serve in the imperial army. In the middle of Li Siyuan's Changxing era (930-933), Zhang became the commander of the cavalry and infantry soldiers at Hedong and was given the honorary title of acting Situ (), as well as the prefect of Qin Prefecture (Ê¨ΩÂ∑û, in modern Qinzhou, Guangxi) ‚Äî an honorary post as well, as Qin was then under the rule of Southern Han. In 932, he was made the military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhangguo Circuit (ÂΩ∞Âúã, headquartered in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi), and given the honorary title of acting Taibao.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 33. In 933, he was made the military governor of Datong Circuit (Â§ßÂêå, headquartered in modern Datong, Shanxi). At that time, it was frequent that the tribal forces of the Khitan Empire would send herds into Later Tang territory to graze. Zhang put sufficient garrisons on the border such that the Khitan did not dare to enter Datong territory, and it was said that the people in the border regions relied on him for protection.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278.  After Li Siyuan's reign  By 935, Li Siyuan's adoptive son Li Congke had become emperor. That year, there was an incident in which his brother-in-law (Li Siyuan's son-in-law) Shi Jingtang, then the military governor of Hedong and who also carried the title of the commander of the armies in the north (i.e., on the Khitan border), was hailed by his soldiers with, \\"May you live 10,000 years!\\" (traditionally a hail for the emperor only) while he led his troops at Xin Prefecture (ÂøªÂ∑û, in modern Xinzhou) in defending against a potential Khitan attack. While Shi executed 36 soldiers who led the hail, it nevertheless caused Li Congke, who had already been previously suspicious of Shi's intentions, to be more concerned. He thus commissioned Zhang Jingda, who was then serving as the military governor of Wuning Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), as the deputy commander of the armies in the north, stationed at Dai, to divide Shi's army.Zizhi Tongian, vol. 279. (Either at the same time or thereafter, his own military governorship was transferred from Wuning to Jianxiong Circuit (Âª∫ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Linfen, Shanxi). In spring 936, in order to test Li Congke's intentions toward him, Shi requested to be transferred. Believing that Shi would rebel if he transferred Shi but that he could defeat the rebellion, Li Congke issued an edict transferring Shi to Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong) and a close associate, Song Shenqian () the military governor of Heyang Circuit (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan) to Hedong. He also ordered Zhang to go to Hedong to \\"escort\\" Shi from Hedong to Tianping, to put pressure on Shi. Shi thereafter rebelled, issuing a declaration claiming that as Li Congke was an adoptive son, he should not be emperor, and that he should pass the throne to a younger brother, Li Congyi the Prince of Xu (Li Siyuan's youngest biological son). Li Congke, in response, put Zhang in command of an army to attack Hedong, with Yang Guangyuan the military governor of Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei) serving as his deputy. Zhang quickly put Taiyuan under siege, building a wall around it to plan for a lengthy siege. However, by this time, Shi had received promise from Khitan's Emperor Taizong that he would come to Shi's aid in the fall, and Li Congke, hearing of this, ordered Zhang to intensify the siege. Zhang did, but due to weather issues, his offensive bulwarks had difficulty being completed, and while the situation in Hedong's capital Taiyuan was becoming desperate, with food supplies dwindling, the city did not fall. In fall 936, Emperor Taizong arrived with a Khitan army, and quickly engaged the Later Tang army under Zhang. When the two armies engaged, the Khitan feigned weakness and appeared to withdraw, and led the Later Tang forces into a trap where they were cut in two by the subsequent Khitan charge. Half of the army was slaughtered. Zhang took the other half and retreated to Jin'an Base (), near Taiyuan. The Khitan/Hedong armies thereafter surrounded his army. Zhang's army was sieged for several months there, and made several attempts to fight its way out of the encirclement, led by Zhang's subordinates Gao Xingzhou and Fu Yanqing, but was unsuccessful. Its food supplies became drained, and the situation became desperate. Zhang, however, refused to surrender, believing that other Later Tang generals would eventually come to his aid. When Yang and another general, An Shenqi (), urged him to surrender, he responded: Yang thereafter tried to get An to join him in assassinating Zhang, but An did not have the heart to do so. Gao became aware that Yang was considering assassinating Zhang, and often tried to stay close to Zhang to protect him, but Zhang did not realize this and in fact became suspicious of Gao's being too close to him, so Gao was forced to distance himself. One morning, when the generals were to meet for briefing, Yang arrived first before the other generals, and proceeded to kill Zhang. He cut off Zhang's head and surrendered the army to Emperor Taizong. Emperor Taizong had long respected Zhang for his reputation and his faithfulness, and he had Zhang buried with honor.

It was also the first NFL- CFL exhibition match held since the establishment of the Canadian Football League in 1958, and marked the beginning of a three-year, four game exhibition series between the leagues. The game was played with a mixture of Canadian and American rules. The field featured the larger Canadian dimensions but there were only eleven rather than twelve men a side, as in the NFL; fewer men on a larger surface helped ensure a high scoring game. NFL-style was adopted for down field blocking but it was CFL rules on kicks and returns and the American fair catch rule did not apply. The Cardinals were lopsided victors in the game, 55-26. The Argonauts did surprise by opening up an early 13-1 lead on the strength of a 70-yard interception return by Bob Dehlinger, but the Cardinal's superior weight and blocking won the day. Eight different Cardinals scored touchdowns and four quarterbacks saw action. Cardinals' coach Frank \\"Pop\\" Ivy was intimately familiar with the Canadian game, having coached the Edmonton Eskimos, which gave an advantage to the American squad. Reported to outweigh the Argonauts by an average of twenty pounds, and with specialists at each position, the Cardinals left their Canadian rivals wounded. Four Argos were injured in the contest, including star centre Norm Stoneburgh and Don Caraway, an anchor on the defensive line. Reception and aftermath The game generated enormous interest in the city of Toronto. A total of 27,770 attended, smashing the record for a crowd at an exhibition game in Canada. Before the game few in Toronto had given the Argonauts much of a chance, while post-game reports dwelled on the injuries suffered and the massive traffic snarls the game had created. Given the success at the gate, the Argonauts arranged further games in 1960 and 1961; both were lopsided losses and there were suggestions the team was putting money ahead of the health of its players. Both the Cardinals and Argonauts went on to have dismal seasons going 2-10 and 4-10, respectively By 1960 the Cardinals had moved to St. Louis.

Life and work  Karl Caspar studied at the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart and the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. In 1904 Caspar became a member of the Stuttgarter K√ºnstlerbund (Stuttgart Artists' Association), and in 1906 he joined the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund (German Artists' Association). In 1907 he married fellow-painter and childhood friend and neighbor, Maria Filser. In 1913, he was a founding member of the artists' association M√ºnchener Neue Secession, to which painters like Alexej von Jawlensky, Adolf Erbsl√∂h, Wladimir von Bechtejeff, Paul Klee, and Alexander Kanoldt also belonged. In 1919 he became the chairman of the association. A high point of Caspar's work was the Passion Altar of 1916/1917, housed in the crypt of the Frauenkirche. From 1922 to 1937 Caspar was a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. His works were exhibited in the Degenerate Art Exhibition, which was organized in Munich by the Nazis in 1937. Thereafter, his Christianity-inspired paintings and drawings, influenced equally by Impressionism and Expressionism, were removed from German museums and public collections and/or destroyed, and he was forced to retire from his teaching position. That same year (some sources say the year was 1944, after his Munich house was destroyed in a bombing raid), due to Nazi hostility, he settled with his family in Brannenburg, where he is buried. As early as 1946, Caspar was reappointed professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. In 1948 he was one of the founding members of the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts. That same year, he participated in the Venice Biennale. In 1950 he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. In 1952, he was awarded the first Upper Swabian Art Prize, jointly with his wife. In 1955, a year before his death, he became a member of the Berlin Academy of Arts.

The group was originally named \\"The Nobility\\" but Open Mic renamed the group \\"The Demigodz\\" with inspiration from one of his own verses. The group has changed several times through the years. As of 2012, the group consists of; Apathy, Celph Titled, Ryu, Esoteric, Motive, & Blacastan. The group was originally formed in 1990 by Connecticut emcees Open Mic and Reflex. Apathy joined the group after hearing a demo on the University of Connecticut radio station 91.7. The group expanded during the 1990s to include a number of other members, and they took frequent outings to New York City in order to expose themselves to the East Coast hip hop scene. In the late 1990s, Apathy shifted his focus towards developing his solo career, but the group re-formed in 2000 with Celph Titled, Rise, Open Mic, One-Two, L-Fudge, Louis Logic, and 7L & Esoteric, as well as producer Chum the Skrilla Guerilla. After touring extensively in Europe, the group released the EP \\"The Godz Must Be Crazy\\" in 2002. In 2004, a number of members left the group, leaving only Apathy, Celph Titled, and 7L & Esoteric. New members were subsequently added, including Motive, Blacastan, and Ryu from Styles of Beyond. In 2007, they released the LP \\"The Godz Must Be Crazier.\\" In March 2013, Demigodz released their second full-length album, Killmatic, which features guest appearances from Scoop DeVille and R.A. the Rugged Man and production from DJ Premier. After performing as a group for the first time with all members present in November 2012 in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, Apathy and Celph Titled embarked on a tour to promote the new album including venues in the U.S. and Australia. The album received critical acclaim for its adherence to the lyricism and aesthetic of golden age hip hop. History  The Demigodz were founded in 1990 and were originally called The Nobility by rappers who were in their teens at the time; Reflective and Open Mic from Connecticut; they were strongly influenced by the progressive hip-hop of the time, including the Native Tongues Posse and Public Enemy. The pair recorded countless tracks in Reflex garage with lyrics focusing on sci-fi and conspiracy theories. In an effort to be recognized, the do connected with Connecticut Radio's DJ; Cool C. He played their songs over the local college airwaves, the gossip created by local talk resulted in numerous battles with local rappers, this also increased recognition of the increasingly popular teens. It was also during this time that Open Mic renamed the group to \\"The Demigodz\\", this was due to inspiration from one of his own verses. One day when the band played at UConn's 91.7 radio station, they caught the attention of rapper, Apathy, who was also in his teens at the time. They met Force Five, The Well Vu & Feedback, who taught them the many skills mainly on the \\"output stage of rap\\" by allowing them to record together. By the end of 199 Reflection and Feedback left the group and formed a separate rap group called \\"Skin N Bones\\". Open Mic brought in Apathy (who was then known as Apathy Alien tongue) as a member of the group. Alien Nation rap affiliates; MC Eternia and Naptron were chosen to join The Demigodz roster. They put out a new demo that circulated around the underground rap scene and created gossip on the independent hip hop scene. In 1996, Apathy made contact with Jedi Mind Tricks' Vinnie Paz (then known as \\"Ikon the Verbal Hologram\\"). Paz invited Apathy and MC Eternia down to Philadelphia to record verses with each other he was later featured on Jedi Mind Tricks The Psycho-Social, Chemical, Biological & Electro-Magnetic Manipulation of Human Consciousness, on the tracks \\"The Three Immortals\\", \\"Omnicron\\" and \\"The Apostles' Creed\\". Due to good relation with Jedi Mind Tricks, it led to several extensions and new members to join, including duo 7L & Esoteric. By mid-1997, Eternia and Naptron left The Demigodz group due to personal and musical differences, this also meant the end of the groups relationship with Alien Nation. Apathy began to work as a solo artist and put out several singles and appeared on many compilation discs. Apathy kept the Demigodz name alive by successfully competing in frequent rap battles and openings for acts as Rakim and Black Sheep. Apathy was introduced to Celph Titled, who was attached to a distribution company in New York, soon moved up to the city get a chance to see him personally. Celph also introduced Apathy to the Bronx Science label with which he signed a contract and went on to produce an album Vinyl 12\\" for the record label. In 2000 Apathy officially reformed the Demigodz. The new line up included Apathy, Celph Titled, Rise and One Two. Apathy also brought Open Mic out of retirement in the following months and several more additions were made, including L-Fudge, Louis Logic, Spin 4th, and longtime friends 7L & Esoteric. The culmination of their efforts during this era was their EP The Godz Must Be Crazy, which was released in 2002. In 2004 most of the members left the group; the only members that remained were Apathy, Chum the Skrilla Guerilla, Celph Titled and 7L & Esoteric. They then affiliated with Los Angeles-based Styles of Beyond and joined the Jedi Mind Tricks supergroup collective Army of the Pharaohs. Apathy released a single on January 15, 2007 named \\"DemiGodzilla\\" featuring Motive and Celph Titled. The album was renamed to The Godz Must Be Crazier and was released on November 20, 2007. In 2009, Get Busy Committee was formed in Los Angeles, California by longtime friends Ryu (Styles of Beyond), Apathy and Scoop DeVille. All production was done by Scoop DeVille and Apathy, while vocals are given by everyone in the group. Their debut album, Uzi Does It, was released for pre-sale download on October 27, 2009 at www.getbusycommittee.com, and available on iTunes and other outlets on November 10.ApathyInterview with HipHopDX As a result of this, DemiGodz production was put on halt. Apathy and Celph Titled, 2014 On 23 November 2011, Apathy uploaded a new song onto YouTube called \\"Demigodz Is Back\\", which featured Apathy, Ryu and Celph Titled, produced by Apathy. The song marked the return of Demigodz. On May 10, 2012, the pair announced in an interview with hiphopauthority.com that they are working on a new Demigodz album, titled Killmatic. Celph said that the album would contain all six members \\"Which is: Apathy, Celph Titled, Ryu, Esoteric, Motive, Blacastan.\\" Killmatic was officially released March 5, 2013. In March 2013, Demigodz released their second full-length album, Killmatic. It features artists from[Scoop DeVille and R.A. the Rugged Man and production from DJ Premier. After performing as a group for the first time with all members present in November 2012 in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, Apathy and Celph Titled embarked on a tour to promote the new album including venues in the U.S. and Australia. The album has received critical acclaim for its adherence to Golden Era hip- hop aesthetics and lyricism. In April 2014, Apathy announced that, he and Celph Titled will be working on another album, as a duo, titled Will Sing for Vengeance and is likely to be released during 2015. Record label Demigodz Records (sometimes credited as Demigodz Entertainment) is a record/entertainment company owned and run by Apathy. It was originally made in 1990 by Open Mic & One Two of the original Demigodz rap group but since has been run under Apathy since he took control of the group. It is an independent record label company. Demigodz Records was begun because Apathy did not think that a regular label would want to produce or market the level of output he wanted to produce. He felt that with his own distribution, he would be able to better control his art and image. He was also of the opinion that the industry-standard \\"record label\\" was a defunct business model.

Combining an unsettling, wry humor with a low-tech, Pop sensibility, Cynthia's interactions with the everyday world are both mundane and surreal, in a domestic sphere just slightly askew. As her protagonist navigates the enigmatic and possibly magical properties of her home decor, Moulton initiates relationships with objects and consumer products that are at once banal and uncanny. Background and education Born in Oakhurst, California, Shana Moulton attended the University of California, Berkeley and continued to receive a MFA from Carnegie Mellon University. She has also studied at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture and De Ateliers in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Moulton has been an artist in resident at Harvestworks, New York City (2008), and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council (2011). She has also received fellowships and grants from the Experimental Television Center (2009), the Foundation for Contemporary Arts (2009), and Harvestworks (2010).Shana Moulton She currently works in Brooklyn, New York. Works=Whispering Pines The 10-part video series, Whispering Pines follows the protagonist's search for perfect health and peace through consumer objects. Cynthia, Moulton's intimately autobiographical, surreal, video alter-ego, interacts with appropriated new- age marginalia, prescription drugs, and beauty products in scenes that address the difficulties of self-discovery and fulfillment in a modern, consumerism- driven society. Moulton explains that she is not required to 'get into character' for Cynthia; Cynthia is always there. Moulton says of her alter- ego, \\"It's me in the bathroom; it's me worried about aging; it's me looking at a beauty magazine... We share a brain. I don't even think of her as a character. It's just me.\\" Beck, Graham Frieze October 2012 Through Moulton's narrative of self-discovery, Cynthia gains relief from the social pressures of her domestic products by using them in non-prescribed ways.

Today only the remains of two gates, together with their steps, the castle walls and a cistern have survived.  Geography  Rocky path near the Heidelsburg The castle ruins lie 3 kilometres southeast of Waldfischbach-Burgalben on a rocky ridge of the Drei-Sommer-Berg at a height of 340 metres above sea level (NN) above the valley of Schwarzbachtal.Landesvermessungsamt Rheinland-Pfalz: Topographic map, 1 : 25,000 series, with walks ‚Äì Waldfischbach-Burgalben, Rodalben. 3rd edn., 1999 The Heidelsburg cannot be accessed by car, but there is a waymarked forest walk starting at the Galgenberghaus (\\"Gallows Hill House\\") car park near Waldfischbach-Burgalben (approximately 4 km, duration about one hour), Several well-signed paths of varying difficulty and length run from the Sommerdelle car park in the Schwarzbachtal valley to the Heidelsburg. Most of the route is on gravelled or small forest paths which, depending the season and usage, can be overgrown.  History  According to finds of Roman coins which came to light in the 1970s, the Heidelsburg was built between the 2nd century A.D. (the time of Emperor Hadrian) and 351 (the time of the Germanic invasions). Based on the location and shape of the site as well as a find of Gallic coins, historians believe it is possible that there may have been an earlier structure going back to the Celts, with an origin of around 100 B.C. It is also possible that the castle was extended during the late Carolingian period, as suggested by certain features in the construction of the chamber gate.G√ºnter Stein: Burgen und Schl√∂sser in der Pfalz. Frankfurt, 1976. In a 1355 document, a rock formation is named as the Bunenstein and recorded as being situated at the same spot as the Heidelsburg. It was sold by Count Arnold of Homburg to Count Walram of Zweibr√ºcken. The latter wanted to build a castle on the rocks, but this came to nothing.J√ºrgen Keddigkeit: Bunenstein. In: Pf√§lzisches Burgen-Lexikon I (A‚ÄìE). Kaiserslautern, 2007. The actual name of the castle has not survived. The name \\"Heidelsburg\\" is related etymologically to Heiden (\\"heathens\\") and first appeared in the Middle Ages by which time the castle had been a ruin for several centuries. A local source from Waldfischbach mentions the ruins around 1600. In 1990 the site went into the possession of the state Forestry and Castle department of the Office for Heritage Monuments.Magnus Backes: Staatliche Burgen, Schl√∂sser und Altert√ºmer in Rheinland-Pfalz. Regensburg, 2003.  Site  The Saltuarius and his wife (replica of a gravestone) According to historians, Christian Mehlis (1883) and Friedrich Sprater (1927/28), who conducted the excavations in two stages, there was an oval walled enclosure of solid ashlars on the ridge that drops steeply into the Schwarzbachtal valley. This enclosure made good use of natural bunter sandstone rock faces and reinforced an older structure of wooden posts. Within this wall was the Roman camp which had two gates, one at the eastern end and one at the western end. Today only remnants of the defensive wall can be made out. The west gate was rebuilt by Sprater in the late 1920s from the heavily moss-covered original ashlars. The function of a depression in the area of the ring wall is unclear; it may have been a cistern. In the local history museum at Waldfischbach-Burgalben there is a model of the entire site. During the first phase of excavation work in the 19th century, a grave slab was uncovered that portrayed a man with an axe and a woman with a basket. The axe was the symbol of a Roman forest manager, the Saltuarius, and an eponymous name suffix, inscribed on the wall, was found in the vicinity along with a corresponding tool. Although there are no written sources detailing whether and to what extent the Romans operating around the Heidelsburg area were actually engaged in forestry, it is nevertheless the oldest known evidence of forest administration in late antiquity on German soil. As a result, tourist promotional material claims the Heidelsburg to be the \\"oldest forestry office in Germany\\". The grave slab is housed today in the History Museum of the Palatinate in Speyer. At the location of the find in the area of the destroyed east wall an 1876 replica was found. The local history museum in Waldfischbach-Burgalben has a wood carving that comes from a local hobby carver. In addition to coins, shards of Roman pottery and iron tools were found in the area around the castle, which are also displayed in the local history museum. From the west gate there is a circular path that runs over the beech-covered plateau between the natural rock formations and the remains of the circular wall.

It was first described by Elie-Abel Carri√®re in 1872 and is native to Hebei province, China. The species is not known in a truly wild state. It has been important for breeding commercial plum cultivars from crosses with other species of the genus Prunus. The species is named for Gabriel Eug√®ne Simon (1829‚Äì1896), a French botanist and diplomat who sent pits to the Paris Museum in the early 1860s while he was representing the French government in China.Gledhill, D.

Beginning about 1881, the species became commonly known in the United States; having been introduced there from France. Description Prunus simonii is a small deciduous tree growing to about in height. The flowers produce almost no pollen; the fruit varies in quality, can be bitter or pleasant to eat, and is flat in shape. Just like an apricot, the fruit flesh clings tightly to the pit. The taste is often bitter. Fruit production is not particularly bountiful. The fruit is dark red or \\"brick red\\". The branches are slender and the leaves oblong. In appearance, the fruit is flatter than most plums, looking \\"tomato-like\\". The fruit is particularly aromatic, much more so than Prunus salicina, with a comparatively high level of hexyl acetate, which gives apples their aroma.https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/160695/Prunus-simonii/Details Uses Plant breeder Luther Burbank devoted a lot of work to hybridizing this species with the Japanese plum (Prunus salicina) and developed a number of cultivars from the hybrid. Of these, the cultivar 'Climax' was particularly notable for its importance to the fruit shipping industry of California. Other influential plum cultivars that Burbank developed with P. simonii ancestry include 'Maynard', 'Chalco', 'Santa Rosa', and 'Formosa'. Those two species and the European species Prunus cerasifera have contributed the majority of the genetic constitution of modern Japanese-type plum cultivars, with lesser contributions from three native American species P. americana, P. angustifolia, and P. munsoniana.

Her works are in the collection of the Museum of Arts and Design, New York, National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum.  Early life  The youngest of three children, Warashina was born and raised in Spokane, Washington. She received her B.F.A in 1962 and M.F.A in 1964 from the University of Washington, Seattle, where she studied with sculptors Robert Sperry, Harold Myers, Rudy Autio, Sh≈çji Hamada, Shinsaku Hamada, and Ruth Penington.  Career  Warashina‚Äôs work is often humorous, and includes \\"clay figures placed in imagined environments that show her subversive thinking.\\" She uses sculpture to explore such themes as the human condition, feminism, car-culture, and political and social topics. As an art student at the University of Washington in the 1960s, Warashina noticed that the environment in the ceramics studio included a somewhat macho culture; women were not included in technical discussions relating to managing the kiln. She began creating a series of figurative works that used humor to skewer this gender imbalance in the field. In 1962, Warashina had her first solo exhibition at the Phoenix Art Gallery in Seattle. Warashina's first husband was fellow student Fred Bauer, and from 1964 to 1970 she exhibited as Patti Bauer. In 1976, she married Robert Sperry. She began teaching in 1964 and has taught at Wisconsin State University, Eastern Michigan University, the Cornish School of Allied Arts, and the University of Washington. During the 1970s and 1980s, Warashina, Sperry, and Howard Kottler ran the ceramics program at the University of Washington's School of Art, growing it into one of the best-known in the United States.

Her fame spread as far as France and England in the 12th and 13th centuries. A Latin text that gathered some of her therapies (and even recounted a cure she had performed) was incorporated into an ensemble of treatises on women's medicine that came to be known as the Trotula, \\"the little book [called] 'Trotula'.\\" Gradually, readers became unaware that this was the work of three different authors. They were also unconscious of name of the historical writer, which was \\"Trota\\" and not \\"Trotula.\\" The latter was thenceforth misunderstood as the author of the whole compendium. These misconceptions about the author of Trotula contributed to the erasure or modification of her name, gender, level of education, medical knowledge, or the time period in which the texts were written; this trend often resulted from the biases of later scholars. Trota's authentic work (including a collection of her cures, known as the Practical Medicine According to Trota) was forgotten until it was rediscovered in the late 20th century. Separating Trota from \\"Trotula\\" \\"Trotta\\" or \\"Trocta\\" are the only forms of this common woman's name found in Salernitan sources of the 12th century; \\"Trotula,\\" in contrast, is never documented as a woman's name. In the later 12th century, part of the work associated with the historic medical practitioner, Trota of Salerno, the De curis mulierum (\\"On Treatments for Women\\"), was subsumed into a compendium of three different works on women's medicine by three different authors. Since Trota's work was the only one of the three that bore an author's name, she was credited with the whole ensemble, which was initially dubbed with the title, the Trotula, the \\"little (work of) Trota.\\" As the ensemble began to circulate outside of southern Italy, the title \\"Trotula\\" was soon misunderstood as an author's name, and ‚ÄúTrotula‚Äù came to be seen as the singular author of all three texts in the Trotula ensemble. Whatever of Trota's fame endured beyond the 12th century seems to have been fused with the textual persona \\"Trotula.\\" In contrast to the wide popularity of the Trotula texts‚Äîwhich are found in nearly 140 extant copies of the Latin originals, and about 60 copies of vernacular translations‚Äîthe authentic works of Trota survive in only a handful of copies. Hence, in modern scholarship, it is crucial to separate the historical woman Trota from the fate of the Trotula texts, because their historical importance and impact were quite distinct. and Monica H. Green (2008) Making Women‚Äôs Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Premodern Gynaecology (Oxford: Oxford University Press) esp. chapters 1, 5, and 6. Debates about whether \\"Trotula\\" really existed began in the 16th century, generated in part out of the inherent inconsistencies in the assembled work that circulated under \\"her\\" name. Those debates persisted into the later 20th century, when the discovery of Trota's Practica secundum Trotam (\\"Practical Medicine According to Trota\\") and philological analysis of other works associated with her allowed the real historic woman Trota to be seen independently from the textual creation \\"Trotula.\\" Life and Works of Trota No independent biographical information on Trota of Salerno exists beyond information that can be gleaned from writings associated with her. That information allows us to place her sometime in the first half of the 12th century. Additionally, a comprehensive concordance of all textual witnesses to Trota's writings and practices, published in 2007, allows an estimation of the full scope of her work. It is likely that she wrote more than can yet be documented by extant witnesses.Monica H. Green (2007) ‚ÄúReconstructing the Oeuvre of Trota of Salerno,‚Äù in La Scuola medica Salernitana: Gli autori e i testi, ed.

Green (2008) Making Women‚Äôs Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology (Oxford: Oxford University Press) , especially chap. 1. In the 12th and 15th centuries, the Trota's texts were repeatedly published in various cities and had a broad audience throughout western Europe despite the competition of other texts focusing on gynecology and women's health. Practica secundum Trotam (Practical Medicine According to Trota) The work that Trota is most immediately associated with as author is the Practica secundum Trotam (\\"Practical Medicine According to Trota\\"), which covers a variety of different medical topics, from infertility and menstrual disorders to snakebite and cosmetics.Monica H. Green (2007) \\"Reconstructing the Oeuvre of Trota of Salerno,\\" in La Scuola medica Salernitana: Gli autori e i testi, ed. Danielle Jacquart and Agostino Paravicini Bagliani, Edizione Nazionale 'La Scuola medica Salernitana', 1 (Florence: SISMEL/Edizioni del Galluzzo) , pp. 185-88 and 211-13; and Trota was a famous authority on obstetrics and a renowned midwife in Salerno. Although her works are known for their practical information on gynecology and obstetrics, Trota also wrote on medical problems faced by both men and women. In her practical book of medicine, Practica Secundum Trotum, she dedicated about three quarters of the text to ailments that are not specific to women, such as internal diseases, fevers, and wounds. This illustrates that Trota was not limited to problems in gynecology or obstetrics when treating her patients. The Practica was first discovered in 1985 by California Institute of Technology historian John F. Benton. Benton found the text in a Madrid manuscript likely written at the very beginning of the 13th century. A second, partial copy of the text was discovered by Monica H. Green in a manuscript now in Oxford.Monica H. Green (2007) ‚ÄúReconstructing the Oeuvre of Trota of Salerno,‚Äù in La Scuola medica Salernitana: Gli autori e i testi, ed.

De curis mulierum (On Treatments for Women) Trota is also the authoritative figure behind one of three texts in the so-called Trotula ensemble, a compendium of works on women's medicine brought together later in the 12th century.Monica H. Green, ed. and trans. (2001) The ‚ÄòTrotula‚Äô: A Medieval Compendium of Women‚Äôs Medicine (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press) (ebook) (print) This is the text known as De curis mulierum (\\"On Treatments for Women\\"). Trota cannot properly be called the \\"author\\" of this text, or at least not in the form in which it has survived, because she is cited within the text in the third person. Trota appears in an anecdote about a young woman suffering from ventositas matricis (\\"wind in the uterus\\"). As the text explains, sometimes women \\"take in wind\\" into their uterus, \\"with the result that to certain people they look as if they were ruptured or suffering from intestinal pain.\\" Trota was called in to treat a woman suffering from the condition. The text stressed that \\"Trota was called in as if she were a master.\\" The Latin word for \\"master\\" here is in the feminine form, magistra, the most compelling sign that Trota had a social stature comparable to that of male magistri.Monica H. Green (2007) ‚ÄúReconstructing the Oeuvre of Trota of Salerno,‚Äù in La Scuola medica Salernitana: Gli autori e i testi, ed. Danielle Jacquart and Agostino Paravicini Bagliani, Edizione Nazionale ‚ÄòLa Scuola medica Salernitana‚Äô, 1 (Florence: SISMEL/Edizioni del Galluzzo) , p. 213. This treatment of \\"wind\\" in the uterus has no other parallel with known works coming out of Salerno. But much of the rest of the text of De curis mulierum has strong echoes of practices of Trota's known from the Practica secundum Trotam. The third-person reference to Trota's cure raises the question of who the \\"we\\" is that is seen throughout most of the text of De curis mulierum. Green posits that the text seems to capture the collective practices of one group of female practitioners, setting down their cures for another group of readers (or auditors) who will have the same unfettered access to the bodies of their female patients: \\"it appears to have been written down to provide a more permanent and concrete mechanism for the transmission of knowledge from woman to woman than the oral forms that had traditionally served the needs of Salernitan women.... [T]he text posits a community of female readers who would be able to rely on this text for instruction...\\"Monica H. Green (2008) Making Women‚Äôs Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology (Oxford: Oxford University Press) p. 58. Women's literacy is not well documented in southern Italy in this period, which raises the question of why the De curis mulierum was written down in the first place. Green finds a clue to this question in the three words of English derivation found in the earliest copies of the text. The De curis mulierum may have been written down, she suggests, not for the benefit of local women in Salerno, but for an audience in England eager in general to learn about medical practices in far- off Salerno.Monica H. Green (2008) Making Women‚Äôs Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology (Oxford: Oxford University Press) p. 62. Both England and southern Italy were under Norman rule at this point, and transference of southern Italian medical writings to Normandy and especially England are well-documented in this period.Monica H. Green, \\"Rethinking the Manuscript Basis of Salvatore De Renzi‚Äôs Collectio Salernitana: The Corpus of Medical Writings in the 'Long' Twelfth Century,\\" in La 'Collectio Salernitana' di Salvatore De Renzi, ed. Danielle Jacquart and Agostino Paravicini Bagliani, Edizione Nazionale 'La Scuola medica Salernitana', 3 (Florence: SISMEL/Edizioni del Galluzzo, 2008), 15-60. In fact, the manuscript where we find the earliest copy of the original version of the De curis mulierum‚ÄîOxford, Bodleian Library, MS Digby 79, from the early 13th century‚Äîseems to have been written both in Italy and in England.Monica H. Green (2007) ‚ÄúReconstructing the Oeuvre of Trota of Salerno,‚Äù in La Scuola medica Salernitana: Gli autori e i testi, ed. Danielle Jacquart and Agostino Paravicini Bagliani, Edizione Nazionale ‚ÄòLa Scuola medica Salernitana‚Äô, 1 (Florence: SISMEL/Edizioni del Galluzzo) , p. 201. Trota's Reputation and the Medieval Fate of Her Writings The anecdote of Trota's cure of the young woman with \\"wind\\" in her womb is already an indication of the fame she enjoyed in her own community. To be likened to a male master of medicine in being called a \\"magistra operis\\" was a notable accomplishment, especially since the feminine form magistra is hardly documented at all in this period. Further evidence of the healer Trota has, however, not yet been found in Salernitan documents. No male Salernitan medical writers from the period cite her by name, and although many women named Trota (or \\"Trocta\\") are mentioned in Salernitan documents, it is impossible to identify this specific Trota with any one of them. Trota, for her part, mentions a couple of her male contemporaries. In Treatments for Women, there are two references to the Salernitan physician Copho: in one case, she refers clearly to a doctrinal point of Copho's anatomical teaching. In another instance, she (or someone who edited her text) seems to borrow extensively from Copho's analysis of the causes of, and therapies for, infertility. Additionally, Trota seems to credit a \\"golden unguent\\" for treating lesions of the penis to master Ferrarius.Monica H. Green (2007) ‚ÄúReconstructing the Oeuvre of Trota of Salerno,‚Äù in La Scuola medica Salernitana: Gli autori e i testi, ed. Danielle Jacquart and Agostino Paravicini Bagliani, Edizione Nazionale ‚ÄòLa Scuola medica Salernitana‚Äô, 1 (Florence: SISMEL/Edizioni del Galluzzo) , pp. 201-2. Trota, therefore, had an awareness of the work of her male contemporaries, so it is notable that they do not reciprocate. The several mentions by male writers of the practices of the mulieres Salernitane (\\"the women of Salerno\\") as an undifferentiated group seem only occasionally to capture the kinds of therapies Trota practiced.Monica H. Green, ed. and trans. (2001) The ‚ÄòTrotula‚Äô: A Medieval Compendium of Women‚Äôs Medicine (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press) (ebook) (print), pp. 48-49.  The Dame Trote  A lasting record of her fame is more easily found in northern Europe. A thirteenth-century Anglo-Norman cosmetic text, Ornatus mulierum (On the Adornment of Women), refers to \\"Dame Trote\\" twelve times. Indeed, the author actually claims to have studied with Trota, and she is the only woman cited by name as a source for information.Pierre Ruelle, ed., L‚ÄôOrnement des Dames (Ornatus mulierum): Texte anglo-normande du XIIIe si√®cle. Le plus ancien recueil en fran√ßais de recettes m√©dicales pour les soins du visage, publi√© avec une introduction, une traduction, des notes et un glossaire (Brussels: Presses Universitaires de Bruxelles, 1967; and Monica H. Green (2007) ‚ÄúReconstructing the Oeuvre of Trota of Salerno,‚Äù in La Scuola medica Salernitana: Gli autori e i testi, ed. Danielle Jacquart and Agostino Paravicini Bagliani, Edizione Nazionale ‚ÄòLa Scuola medica Salernitana‚Äô, 1 (Florence: SISMEL/Edizioni del Galluzzo) , pp. 189-90 and 214-18. As Green has suggested, Trota's international esteem may itself have led to the creation of Treatments for Women, which, as noted above, shows signs of having been assembled by an English-speaking visitor to Salerno.  The Codex Salernitanus  Trota's status as a medical author is most strikingly documented by a work found uniquely in a late 12th-century manuscript, the Codex Salernitanus, that was held in the city library of the Polish town of Wroc≈Çaw (Breslau). How the manuscript arrived in Poland is unclear, since it seems (based on the handwriting of its scribes) to have been written in France. Wroc≈Çaw, Stadtbibliothek, MS 1302, was destroyed in bombing during World War II, but major portions of it had been published in the previous century. The manuscript contains a work there called De egritudinum curatione, On the Treatment of Illnesses. The work is a compilation of therapies from seven Salernitan writers, identified in marginal notes such as \\"M.C.\\" for magister Copho (\\"master Copho\\"). We know now that the passages attributed to a name abbreviated as \\"Trot'\\" should be recognized as the work of Trota of Salerno. In fact, it is likely that she was responsible for additional passages in the text that had no attribution. The Salernitan De egritudinum curatione seems never to have been copied again after the Codex Salernitanus was assembled, nor did the Practica secundum Trotam receive much circulation. Hence, knowledge of Trota outside of what was preserved in the Trotula texts faded. At some point in the thirteenth century, memory that \\"Trota\\" was the actual woman's name was lost, and scribes began inserting \\"Trotula\\" into the passage describing Trota's cure in the Treatments for Women. At the same time, lore about \\"Trotula\\" as an \\"expert on women's affairs\\" continued to grow, both positively in the rising prominence of the Trotula texts sources for knowledge on women's medicine (they circulated not only in Latin but also in multiple new translations into European vernacular languages), but also negatively, as \\"Trotula\\" was used as a mouthpiece to articulate misogynistic views (for example, in the Prologue to Chaucer's The Wife of Bath's Tale).  The Erasure of the Feminine Trota  The Trotula works fell into the hands of Georg Kraut in 1544, who rearranged the three component texts to appear as though it was authored by a single person. He also removed the mention of common names beyond the third century, which led future readers and publishers to assume it was an ancient text. Later, in the sixteenth century, Casper Wolf, who acted as the next editor of Trotula, changed the name from Trotula to Eros (a male name) and edited a verbal form from feminine to masculine to agree with the name change. This falsely accredited the text to a man and placed it in the ancient period, contributing to the erasure of a woman author in the Middle Ages. Throughout scholarship of the Trotula, historians, researchers, and philologists have dismissed her authorship, gender, and medical knowledge on various grounds. For example, in 1773, Gruner dismissed Trota's possible authorship of the texts because she was mentioned within the text, not specifically as the author; instead, he referred to the author as a masculine unknown. Often, the time period, gender, author attribution, and/or Trota's believed level of education are downplayed, upgraded, or dismissed based on the bias of the scholar or the purpose of their research. Although Trota is not frequently connected to Hildegard of Bingen, another female author and practitioner of medicine in the 12th century, in academic writing, Green draws parallels between their lives and the future of their texts. First, both women were renowned for their authority on certain medical subjects during and after their time. Later, specifically the Renaissance and the modern period, their works were studied by historians, philologists, and physicians, who often questioned the legitimacy of or contributed to the erasure of their authorship or medical knowledge.  \\"Trota\\" in a Copy of De curis mulierum  One very interesting exception to this general erasure of the historic Trota has recently been discovered. The Catalan historian of medicine, Montserrat Cabr√© i Pairet, has discovered a partial 15th-century Catalan translation of the De curis mulierum, the only one of the three Trotula texts to have preserved the original teaching of Trota. The scribe of the manuscript (who may have been a surgeon copying the text for their own use) apparently compared the Catalan translation with a copy they found of the original Latin De curis mulierum, recording that, in the original Latin, the maestra who had been called in was called Trota \\"in the Latin.\\"Montserrat Cabr√© i Pairet, \\"Trota, Tr√≤tula i Tr√≤tula: Autoria i autoritat femenina en la medicina medieval en catal√†\\" [Trota, Trotula and Tr√≤tula: Female Authorship and Authority in Medieval Medicine in Catalan], in: Els Manuscrits, el saber i les lletres a la Corona d‚ÄôArag√≥, 1250-1500, ed. Lola Badia, Llu√≠s Cifuentes, Sadurn√≠ Mart√≠, Josep Pujol (Montserrat: Publicacions de l‚ÄôAbadia de Montserrat, 2016), pp. 77-102 and 249-50 (abstract). This singular acknowledgement of Trota's fame aside, overall, recognition of the historic Trota had all but disappeared by the end of the Middle Ages. This led to controversy about the authorship of Trotula, which directed medical scholarship on the texts for the next 400 years, starting in the sixteenth century.Monica H. Green (2008) Making Women‚Äôs Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology (Oxford: Oxford University Press) , chap. 6. The Rediscovery of Trota in the 20th and 21st Centuries The Codex Salernitanus, that large collection of Salernitan texts, was first brought to the notice of modern scholars in 1837, and the text of De egritudinum curatione‚ÄîOn the Treatment of Illnesses‚Äîwas first published two decades later.Collectio Salernitana ossia documenti inediti, e trattati di medicina appartenenti alla scuola medica salernitana, ed. Salvatore de Renzi. 5 vols., Naples 1852-1859; repr. Bologna 1967, II, 81-385. In the early 20th century, the Leipzig historian of medicine, Karl Sudhoff, had a stream of medical students edit (or re-edit) different texts from the Codex Salernitanus. In 1921, Conrad Hiersemann chose to re-edit the sections of the De egritudinum curatione ascribed to \\"Trot'.\\" Hiersemann assumed that the name was masculine, and so expanded it to \\"Trottus.\\"Conrad Hiersemann, Die Abschnitte aus der Practica des Trottus in der Salernitanischen Sammelschrift ‚ÄòDe Aegritudinum Curatione‚Äô. Breslau Codex Salern. 1160‚Äì1170, inaugural dissertation, Leipzig 1921. This erasure of the female author Trota was not questioned until 1985, when John F. Benton, a historian at the California Institute of Technology, discovered the Practica secundum Trotam, the text in the manuscript in Madrid. Benton realized that the Practica had multiple overlaps with therapies ascribed to \\"Trot'\\" in the De egritudinum curatione. He was thus able to retrieve the historic woman Trota from the oblivion into which she had fallen for 800 years. However, Benton persisted in his belief that the Trotula texts‚Äîwhich he had proven were originally the work of three separate 12th- century writers‚Äîwere all male-authored and had nothing to do with the real Trota. What Benton did not realize was that the Practica secundum Trotam also had multiple overlaps with the second of the three Trotula texts, the De curis mulierum (On Treatments for Women). That discovery was made by Monica H. Green, a historian of medieval women's medicine.This discovery was first announced in In 2007, Green established the overlaps and parallels between all four texts witnessing any part of Trota's work: the Salernitan De egritudinum curatione; Practica secundum Trotam; De curis mulierum; and certain cosmetic practices attributed to \\"Dame Trote\\" in the Anglo-Norman cosmetic text. Together, these works suggest that Trota's skill extended to most areas of medical practice, save general surgery.Monica H. Green (2007) ‚ÄúReconstructing the Oeuvre of Trota of Salerno,‚Äù in La Scuola medica Salernitana: Gli autori e i testi, ed. Danielle Jacquart and Agostino Paravicini Bagliani, Edizione Nazionale ‚ÄòLa Scuola medica Salernitana‚Äô, 1 (Florence: SISMEL/Edizioni del Galluzzo) . Green was not optimistic, however, about what this collected evidence for Trota has to say about the status of women in medicine in 12th-century Salerno. She sees Trota as being on the very edge of literate traditions in medicine: Trota cites no authoritative sources (like Hippocrates or Galen), and there is little by way of physiological theory or explanation of the causes of disease. Green concludes: \\"Trota did succeed in establishing her stature ‚Äòin the forum‚Äô as an empiricist. But as a theorist who could impart doctrinae [formal teachings] to students, she had no impact at all.\\"Monica H. Green (2008) Making Women‚Äôs Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology (Oxford: Oxford University Press) p. 65. Indeed, Green sees the story of Trota as emblematic of the marginal status of women in the changing spheres of intellectual life in Europe in the 12th century, when universities were first taking hold. We have evidence of other female medical practitioners in southern Italy in the centuries after Trota.Monica H. Green, ‚ÄúDocumenting Medieval Women‚Äôs Medical Practice,‚Äù in Practical Medicine from Salerno to the Black Death, ed.

Walsh has said that her artistic medium is ‚Äústudy.‚Äù Walsh's book Hello Leonora, Soy Anne Walsh (2019, no place press/MIT Press) epitomizes the aggressively indexical, personal, and analytical nature of her practice. A visual and written ‚Äòadaptation‚Äô of Leonora Carrington's 1950 fantastical feminist novella The Hearing Trumpet, the book traces Walsh's decade-long, multi-part response to the novella‚Äîincluding meeting the author and corresponding with her. Other recent adaptations include Walsh's live performances with poet Jocelyn Saidenberg of Camille Roy's play Sometimes Dead is Better, and her video installation Anthem, in which Walsh performed, with a troupe of Oakland elders, the Oscar- winning song Let It Go, from the 2014 Disney film Frozen.

She is now a contributing editor to the publication. Walsh concerns herself with language and time. And where as the Met enshrines the traditional media of canonical art history‚Äîpainting, sculpture, and physical artifact‚ÄîWalsh instead makes innovative use of video, sound, and software to create art that, inherently ephemeral, resists the pull of the pedestal. By breaking down language and sensory experience into microscopic parts, divorced from any immediate physical or social context, her pieces have been called weird or disorienting.

It is the sound of ‚Äúsilence‚Äù in a room, though never quite silent as each room tone is inflected by different characteristics such as sonic reflections bouncing off physical architecture, the absorptive presence of bodies, and other kinds of technology present (i.e., the subtle hum of air-handling systems and lights). Room Tone is run by a computer program that generates sounds drawn from a database of approximately 1,000 room tones through four separate channels. The program may layer, cut up, and combine these room tones, varying in duration and volume, to create a new, dynamic, and visceral room tone for any particular space. Constantly changing and evolving, the aural experience of Room Tone humorously plays with the oft- cited adage of John Cage: ‚ÄúThere is no such thing as an empty space or an empty time. There is always something to see, something to hear.

It is sometimes simply referred to as the Commission Palace. Currently it is not the home to the named ministry, but serves as Warsaw's official city hall, the seat of the President of Warsaw and the provincial office of the Mazovia province. History In the middle of the 17th Century, a residence was built for Chancellor Jan Leszczy≈Ñski which was probably designed by the Italian architect Giovanni Battista Gisleni. In the second half of the 18th century the palace was owned by J√≥zef Potocki, and then by the Zieli≈Ñski family. The palace was fundamentally rebuilt from 1823 to 1825 by Antonio Corazzi in neo-classical form as the base of the Ministry of Revenues and Treasury for its minister Franciszek Ksawery Drucki-Lubecki. There was the Stock Exchange, the Minister's Palace as well as the Ministry building all adjacent to each other.http://www.polskaniezwykla.pl/web/place/24200,warszawa-palac-komisji- rzadowej-przychodow-i-skarbu.html From 1829 to 1831, Polish romantic poet Juliusz S≈Çowacki worked here as an official. From 1919 to 1921 the buildings were renovated under the direction of Marian Lalewicz for the Ministry of Treasury. During the invasion of Poland in 1939 the palace was burnt after being hit by German bombs and during the Warsaw Uprising it was almost completely destroyed, however some walls stayed intact. After the war, it was rebuilt in its neo-classical form under the supervision of architect Piotr Biega≈Ñski and began its current role. Architecture The three-storey palace is located on a horseshoe-shaped floor plan around a main central courtyard. The six-columned Corinthian portico dominates. The sculptures in the tympanum of this portico are by Pawe≈Ç Mali≈Ñski and represent allegories of wisdom (Minerva), industry (Jason), trade (Mercury), and the Vistula and Bug rivers. The second level above the running frieze includes cherubs and garlands probably by M. Vincenti. The side wings of the palace help form the courtyard and are in the style of the main building. Overlooking Bank Square there is only two floors, both wings are also narrower than the main wing. The wings are each of a stepped gable nature. In front of the one wing is a monument to Juliusz S≈Çowacki, designed by Edward Wittig (actually designed in 1932), and unveiled in 2001 to replace a statue to Felix Dzerzhinsky (by Zbigniew Dunajewski).

Middle Scots became the dominant language of Scotland in the late Middle Ages. The first surviving major text in Scots literature is John Barbour's Brus (1375). Some ballads may date back to the thirteenth century, but were not recorded until the eighteenth century. In the early fifteenth century Scots historical works included Andrew of Wyntoun's verse Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland and Blind Harry's The Wallace. Much Middle Scots literature was produced by makars, poets with links to the royal court, which included James I, who wrote the extended poem The Kingis Quair. Writers such as William Dunbar, Robert Henryson, Walter Kennedy and Gavin Douglas have been seen as creating a golden age in Scottish poetry. In the late fifteenth century, Scots prose also began to develop as a genre. The first complete surviving work is John Ireland's The Meroure of Wyssdome (1490). There were also prose translations of French books of chivalry that survive from the 1450s. The landmark work in the reign of James IV was Gavin Douglas's version of Virgil's Aeneid. James V supported William Stewart and John Bellenden, who translated the Latin History of Scotland compiled in 1527 by Hector Boece, into verse and prose. David Lyndsay wrote elegiac narratives, romances and satires. From the 1550s cultural pursuits were limited by the lack of a royal court and the Kirk heavily discouraged poetry that was not devotional. Nevertheless poets from this period included Richard Maitland of Lethington, John Rolland and Alexander Hume. Alexander Scott's use of short verse designed to be sung to music, opened the way for the Castilan poets of James VI's adult reign. who included William Fowler, John Stewart of Baldynneis, and Alexander Montgomerie. Plays in Scots included Lyndsay's The Thrie Estaitis, the anonymous The Maner of the Cyring of ane Play and Philotus. After his accession to the English throne, James VI increasingly favoured the language of southern England and the loss of the court as a centre of patronage in 1603 was a major blow to Scottish literature. The poets who followed the king to London began to anglicise their written language and only significant court poet to continue to work in Scotland after the king's departure was William Drummond of Hawthornden. After the Union in 1707 the use of Scots was discouraged. Allan Ramsay (1686‚Äì1758) is often described as leading a \\"vernacular revival\\" and he laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature. He was part of a community of poets working in Scots and English that included William Hamilton of Gilbertfield, Robert Crawford, Alexander Ross, William Hamilton of Bangour, Alison Rutherford Cockburn and James Thompson. Also important was Robert Fergusson. Robert Burns is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland, working in both Scots and English. His \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" is often sung at Hogmanay, and \\"Scots Wha Hae\\" served for a long time as an unofficial national anthem. Scottish poetry is often seen as entering a period of decline in the nineteenth century, with Scots-language poetry criticised for its use of parochial dialect. Conservative and anti-radical Burns clubs sprang up around Scotland, filled with poets who fixated on the \\"Burns stanza\\" as a form. Scottish poetry has been seen as descending into infantalism as exemplified by the highly popular Whistle Binkie anthologies, leading into the sentimental parochialism of the Kailyard school. Poets from the lower social orders who used Scots included the weaver-poet William Thom. Walter Scott, the leading literary figure of the early nineteenth century, largely wrote in English, and Scots was confined to dialogue or interpolated narrative, in a model that would be followed by other novelists such as John Galt and Robert Louis Stevenson. James Hogg provided a Scots counterpart to the work of Scott.G. Carruthers, Scottish Literature (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2009), , p. 58. However, popular Scottish newspapers regularly included articles and commentary in the vernacular and there was an interest in translations into Scots from other Germanic languages, such as Danish, Swedish and German, including those by Robert Jamieson and Robert Williams Buchanan. In the early twentieth century there was a new surge of activity in Scottish literature, influenced by modernism and resurgent nationalism, known as the Scottish Renaissance. The leading figure in the movement was Hugh MacDiarmid who attempted to revive the Scots language as a medium for serious literature, developing a form of Synthetic Scots that combined different regional dialects and archaic terms. Other writers that emerged in this period, and are often treated as part of the movement, include the poets Edwin Muir and William Soutar. Some writers that emerged after the Second World War followed MacDiarmid by writing in Scots, including Robert Garioch, Sydney Goodsir Smith and Edwin Morgan, who became known for translations of works from a wide range of European languages. Alexander Gray is chiefly remembered for this translations into Scots from the German and Danish ballad traditions into Scots. Writers who reflected urban contemporary Scots included Douglas Dunn, Tom Leonard and Liz Lochhead. The Scottish Renaissance increasingly concentrated on the novel. George Blake pioneered the exploration of the experiences of the working class. Lewis Grassic Gibbon produced one of the most important realisations of the ideas of the Scottish Renaissance in his trilogy A Scots Quair. Other writers that investigated the working class included James Barke and J. F. Hendry. From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, particularly associated with a group of Glasgow writers that included Alasdair Gray and James Kelman were among the first novelists to fully utilise a working class Scots voice as the main narrator. Irvine Welsh and Alan Warner both made use of vernacular language including expletives and Scots dialect. Background In the late Middle Ages, Middle Scots, often simply called English, became the dominant language of the country. It was derived largely from Old English, with the addition of elements from Gaelic and French. Although resembling the language spoken in northern England, it became a distinct dialect from the late fourteenth century onwards.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 60‚Äì7. It began to be adopted by the ruling elite as they gradually abandoned French. By the fifteenth century it was the language of government, with acts of parliament, council records and treasurer's accounts almost all using it from the reign of James I (1406‚Äì37) onwards. As a result, Gaelic, once dominant north of the Tay, began a steady decline. Development The seal of Gavin Douglas as Bishop of Dunkeld The first surviving major text in Scots literature is John Barbour's Brus (1375), composed under the patronage of Robert II and telling the story in epic poetry of Robert I's actions before the English invasion till the end of the first war of independence.A. A. M. Duncan, ed., The Brus (Canongate, 1997), , p. 3. The work was extremely popular among the Scots- speaking aristocracy and Barbour is referred to as the father of Scots poetry, holding a similar place to his contemporary Chaucer in England.N. Jayapalan, History of English Literature (Atlantic, 2001), , p. 23. Some Scots ballads may date back to the late medieval era and deal with events and people that can be traced back as far as the thirteenth century, including \\"Sir Patrick Spens\\" and \\"Thomas the Rhymer\\", but which are not known to have existed until they were collected and recorded in the eighteenth century.E. Lyle, Scottish Ballads (Edinburgh: Canongate Books, 2001), , pp. 9‚Äì10. They were probably composed and transmitted orally and only began to be written down and printed, often as broadsides and as part of chapbooks, later being recorded and noted in books by collectors including Robert Burns and Walter Scott.R. Crawford, Scotland's Books: a History of Scottish Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), , pp. 216‚Äì9. In the early fifteenth century Scots historical works included Andrew of Wyntoun's verse Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland and Blind Harry's The Wallace, which blended historical romance with the verse chronicle. They were probably influenced by Scots versions of popular French romances that were also produced in the period, including The Buik of Alexander, Launcelot o the Laik, The Porteous of Noblenes by Gilbert Hay. Much Middle Scots literature was produced by makars, poets with links to the royal court, which included James I, who wrote the extended poem The Kingis Quair. Many of the makars had university education and so were also connected with the Kirk. However, William Dunbar's (1460‚Äì1513) Lament for the Makaris (c. 1505) provides evidence of a wider tradition of secular writing outside of Court and Kirk now largely lost.A. Grant, Independence and Nationhood, Scotland 1306‚Äì1469 (Baltimore: Edward Arnold, 1984), pp. 102‚Äì3. Writers such as Dunbar, Robert Henryson, Walter Kennedy and Gavin Douglas have been seen as creating a golden age in Scottish poetry. Major works include Richard Holland's satire the Buke of the Howlat (c. 1448). Dunbar produced satires, lyrics, invectives and dream visions that established the vernacular as a flexible medium for poetry of any kind. Robert Henryson (c. 1450-c. 1505), re- worked Medieval and Classical sources, such as Chaucer and Aesop in works such as his Testament of Cresseid and The Morall Fabillis. Gavin Douglas (1475‚Äì1522), who became Bishop of Dunkeld, injected Humanist concerns and classical sources into his poetry.T. van Heijnsbergen, \\"Culture: 9 Renaissance and Reformation: poetry to 1603\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 129‚Äì30. Much of their work survives in a single collection. The Bannatyne Manuscript was collated by George Bannatyne (1545‚Äì1608) around 1560 and contains the work of many Scots poets who would otherwise be unknown.M. Lynch, \\"Culture: 3 Medieval\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 117‚Äì8. In the late fifteenth century, Scots prose also began to develop as a genre. Although there are earlier fragments of original Scots prose, such as the Auchinleck Chronicle,Thomas Thomson ed., Auchinleck Chronicle (Edinburgh, 1819). the first complete surviving work is John Ireland's The Meroure of Wyssdome (1490).J. Martin, Kingship and Love in Scottish poetry, 1424‚Äì1540 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008), , p. 111. There were also prose translations of French books of chivalry that survive from the 1450s, including The Book of the Law of Armys and the Order of Knychthode and the treatise Secreta Secetorum, an Arabic work believed to be Aristotle's advice to Alexander the Great. The landmark work in the reign of James IV was Gavin Douglas's version of Virgil's Aeneid, the Eneados, which was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an Anglic language, finished in 1513, but overshadowed by the disaster at Flodden in the same year. Golden age James VI in 1585, aged 19. He promoted poetry in his native Scots but abandoned it after he acceded to the English throne in 1603 As a patron of poets and authors James V (r. 1513‚Äì42) supported William Stewart and John Bellenden, who translated the Latin History of Scotland compiled in 1527 by Hector Boece, into verse and prose. David Lyndsay (c. 1486 ‚Äì 1555), diplomat and the head of the Lyon Court, was a prolific poet. He wrote elegiac narratives, romances and satires. From the 1550s, in the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots (r. 1542‚Äì67) and the minority of her son James VI (r. 1567‚Äì1625), cultural pursuits were limited by the lack of a royal court and by political turmoil. The Kirk, heavily influenced by Calvinism, also discouraged poetry that was not devotional in nature. Nevertheless poets from this period included Richard Maitland of Lethington (1496‚Äì1586), who produced meditative and satirical verses in the style of Dunbar; John Rolland (fl. 1530‚Äì75), who wrote allegorical satires in the tradition of Douglas and courtier and minister Alexander Hume (c. 1556‚Äì1609), whose corpus of work includes nature poetry and epistolary verse. Alexander Scott's (?1520‚Äì82/3) use of short verse designed to be sung to music, opened the way for the Castilan poets of James VI's adult reign. From the mid sixteenth century, written Scots was increasingly influenced by the developing Standard English of Southern England due to developments in royal and political interactions with England.J. Corbett, D. McClure and J. Stuart-Smith, \\"A Brief History of Scots\\" in J. Corbett, D. McClure and J. Stuart-Smith, eds, The Edinburgh Companion to Scots (Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press, 2003), , p. 10ff. The English supplied books and distributing Bibles and Protestant literature in the Lowlands when they invaded in 1547.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 102‚Äì4. With the increasing influence and availability of books printed in England, most writing in Scotland came to be done in the English fashion.J. Corbett, D. McClure and J. Stuart-Smith, \\"A Brief History of Scots\\" in J. Corbett, D. McClure and J. Stuart-Smith, eds, The Edinburgh Companion to Scots (Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press, 2003), , p. 11. Leading figure of the Scottish Reformation John Knox was accused of being hostile to Scots because he wrote in a Scots-inflected English developed while in exile at the English court.G. Carruthers, Scottish Literature (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2009), , p. 44. In the 1580s and 1590s James VI strongly promoted the literature of the country of his birth in Scots. His treatise, Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody, published in 1584 when he was aged 18, was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue, to which he applied Renaissance principles.R. D. S. Jack, \\"Poetry under King James VI\\", in C. Cairns, ed., The History of Scottish Literature (Aberdeen University Press, 1988), vol. 1, , pp. 126‚Äì7. He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish Jacobean court poets and musicians, later called the Castalian Band, which included William Fowler (c. 1560 ‚Äì 1612), John Stewart of Baldynneis (c. 1545 ‚Äì c. 1605), and Alexander Montgomerie (c. 1550 ‚Äì 1598).R. D. S. Jack, Alexander Montgomerie (Edinburgh: Scottish Academic Press, 1985), , pp. 1‚Äì2. They translated key Renaissance texts and produced poems using French forms, including sonnets and short sonnets, for narrative, nature description, satire and meditations on love. Later poets that followed in this vein included William Alexander (c. 1567 ‚Äì 1640), Alexander Craig (c. 1567 ‚Äì 1627) and Robert Ayton (1570‚Äì1627). By the late 1590s the king's championing of his native Scottish tradition was to some extent diffused by the prospect of inheriting of the English throne.R. D. S. Jack, \\"Poetry under King James VI\\", in C. Cairns, ed., The History of Scottish Literature (Aberdeen University Press, 1988), vol. 1, , p. 137. In drama Lyndsay produced an interlude at Linlithgow Palace for the king and queen thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540, which satirised the corruption of church and state, and which is the only complete play to survive from before the Reformation.I. Brown, T. Owen Clancy, M. Pittock, S. Manning, eds, The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: From Columba to the Union, until 1707 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , pp. 256‚Äì7. The anonymous The Maner of the Cyring of ane Play (before 1568)T. van Heijnsbergen, \\"Culture: 7 Renaissance and Reformation (1460‚Äì1660): literature\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 127‚Äì8. and Philotus (published in London in 1603), are isolated examples of surviving plays. The latter is a vernacular Scots comedy of errors, probably designed for court performance for Mary, Queen of Scots or James VI.S. Carpenter, \\"Scottish drama until 1650\\", in I. Brown, ed., The Edinburgh Companion to Scottish Drama (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2011), , p. 15. Decline William Drummond of Hawthornden Having extolled the virtues of Scots \\"poesie\\", after his accession to the English throne, James VI increasingly favoured the language of southern England. In 1611 the Kirk adopted the English Authorised King James Version of the Bible. In 1617 interpreters were declared no longer necessary in the port of London because Scots and Englishmen were now \\"not so far different bot ane understandeth ane uther\\". Jenny Wormald, describes James as creating a \\"three- tier system, with Gaelic at the bottom and English at the top\\".J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 192‚Äì3. The loss of the court as a centre of patronage in 1603 was a major blow to Scottish literature. A number of Scottish poets, including William Alexander, John Murray and Robert Aytoun accompanied the king to London, where they continued to write,K. M. Brown, \\"Scottish identity\\", in B. Bradshaw and P. Roberts, eds, British Consciousness and Identity: The Making of Britain, 1533‚Äì1707 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), , pp. 253‚Äì3. but they soon began to anglicise their written language.M. Spiller, \\"Poetry after the Union 1603‚Äì1660\\" in C. Cairns, ed., The History of Scottish Literature (Aberdeen University Press, 1988), vol. 1, , pp. 141‚Äì52. James's characteristic role as active literary participant and patron in the English court made him a defining figure for English Renaissance poetry and drama, which would reach a pinnacle of achievement in his reign,N. Rhodes, \\"Wrapped in the Strong Arm of the Union: Shakespeare and King James\\" in W. Maley and A. Murphy, eds, Shakespeare and Scotland (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2004), , pp. 38‚Äì9. but his patronage for the high style in his own Scottish tradition largely became sidelined.R. D. S. Jack, \\"Poetry under King James VI\\", in C. Cairns, ed., The History of Scottish Literature (Aberdeen University Press, 1988), vol. 1, , pp. 137‚Äì8. The only significant court poet to continue to work in Scotland after the king's departure was William Drummond of Hawthornden (1585‚Äì1649), and he largely abandoned Scots for a form of court English.J. Corbett, Written in the Language of the Scottish Nation: A History of Literary Translation Into Scots (Multilingual Matters, 1999), , p. 77. The most influential Scottish literary figure of the mid-seventeenth century, Thomas Urquhart of Cromarty (1611 ‚Äì c. 1660), who translated The Works of Rabelais, worked largely in English, only using occasional Scots for effect.J. Corbett, Written in the Language of the Scottish Nation: A History of Literary Translation Into Scots (Multilingual Matters, 1999), , p. 89. In the late seventeenth century it looked as if Scots might disappear as a literary language.J. Corbett, Written in the Language of the Scottish Nation: A History of Literary Translation Into Scots (Multilingual Matters, 1999), , p. 94. Revival After the Union in 1707 and the shift of political power to England, the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education.C. Jones, A Language Suppressed: The Pronunciation of the Scots Language in the 18th Century (Edinburgh: John Donald, 1993), p. vii. Intellectuals of the Scottish Enlightenment like David Hume and Adam Smith, went to great lengths to get rid of every Scotticism from their writings.Ian Simpson Ross, The Life of Adam Smith (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2nd edn., 2010), . Following such examples, many well-off Scots took to learning English through the activities of those such as Thomas Sheridan, who in 1761 gave a series of lectures on English elocution. Charging a guinea at a time (about ¬£ in today's money,) they were attended by over 300 men, and he was made a freeman of the City of Edinburgh. Following this, some of the city's intellectuals formed the Select Society for Promoting the Reading and Speaking of the English Language in Scotland. From such eighteenth-century activities grew Scottish Standard English.J. Corbett, D. McClure and J. Stuart-Smith, \\"A Brief History of Scots\\" in J. Corbett, D. McClure and J. Stuart-Smith, eds, The Edinburgh Companion to Scots (Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press, 2003), , p. 13. Scots remained the vernacular of many rural communities and the growing number of urban working class Scots.J. Corbett, D. McClure and J. Stuart-Smith, \\"A Brief History of Scots\\" in J. Corbett, D. McClure and J. Stuart-Smith, eds, The Edinburgh Companion to Scots (Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press, 2003), , p. 14. Allan Ramsay who led a vernacular revival in the eighteenth century Allan Ramsay (1686‚Äì1758) was the most important literary figure of the era, often described as leading a \\"vernacular revival\\". He laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, publishing The Ever Green (1724), a collection that included many major poetic works of the Stewart period.R. M. Hogg, The Cambridge History of the English Language (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), , p. 39. He led the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the Habbie stanza, which would be later be used by Robert Burns as a poetic form. His Tea-Table Miscellany (1724‚Äì37) contained poems old Scots folk material, his own poems in the folk style and \\"gentilizings\\" of Scots poems in the English neo-classical style.\\"Poetry in Scots: Brus to Burns\\" in C. R. Woodring and J. S. Shapiro, eds, The Columbia History of British Poetry (Columbia University Press, 1994), , p. 100. Ramsay was part of a community of poets working in Scots and English. These included William Hamilton of Gilbertfield (c. 1665 ‚Äì 1751), Robert Crawford (1695‚Äì1733), Alexander Ross (1699‚Äì1784), the Jacobite William Hamilton of Bangour (1704‚Äì1754), socialite Alison Rutherford Cockburn (1712‚Äì1794), and poet and playwright James Thompson (1700‚Äì1748).C. Maclachlan, Before Burns (Canongate Books, 2010), , pp. ix‚Äìxviii. Also important was Robert Fergusson (1750‚Äì1774), a largely urban poet, recognised in his short lifetime as the unofficial \\"laureate\\" of Edinburgh. His most famous work was his unfinished long poem, Auld Reekie (1773), dedicated to the life of the city. His borrowing from a variety of dialects prefigured the creation of Synthetic Scots in the twentieth centuryJ. Corbett, Written in the Language of the Scottish Nation: A History of Literary Translation Into Scots (Multilingual Matters, 1999), , p. 106. and he would be a major influence on Robert Burns.R. Crawford, Scotland's Books: a History of Scottish Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), , p. 335. Burns (1759‚Äì1796), an Ayrshire poet and lyricist, is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland and a major figure in the Romantic movement. As well as making original compositions, Burns also collected folk songs from across Scotland, often revising or adapting them. His poem (and song) \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" is often sung at Hogmanay (the last day of the year), and \\"Scots Wha Hae\\" served for a long time as an unofficial national anthem of the country. Burns's poetry drew upon a substantial familiarity with and knowledge of Classical, Biblical, and English literature, as well as the Scottish Makar tradition.Robert Burns: \\"Literary Style \\", retrieved 24 September 2010. Burns was skilled in writing not only in the Scots language but also in the Scottish English dialect of the English language. Some of his works, such as \\"Love and Liberty\\" (also known as \\"The Jolly Beggars\\"), are written in both Scots and English for various effects.Robert Burns: \\"hae meat\\", retrieved 24 September 2010. His themes included republicanism, radicalism, Scottish patriotism, anticlericalism, class inequalities, gender roles, commentary on the Scottish Kirk of his time, Scottish cultural identity, poverty, sexuality, and the beneficial aspects of popular socialising.Red Star Cafe: \\"to the Kibble.\\" Retrieved 24 September 2010. Marginalisation Scottish poetry is often seen as entering a period of decline in the nineteenth century, with Scots-language poetry criticised for its use of parochial dialect.L. Mandell, \\"Nineteenth-century Scottish poetry\\", in I. Brown, ed., The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: Enlightenment, Britain and empire (1707‚Äì1918) (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , pp. 301‚Äì07. Conservative and anti-radical Burns clubs sprang up around Scotland, filled with members that praised a sanitised version of Robert Burns' life and work and poets who fixated on the \\"Burns stanza\\" as a form.G. Carruthers, Scottish Literature (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2009), , pp. 58‚Äì9. Scottish poetry has been seen as descending into infantalism as exemplified by the highly popular Whistle Binkie anthologies, which appeared 1830‚Äì90 and which notoriously included in one volume \\"Wee Willie Winkie\\" by William Miler (1810‚Äì1872). This tendency has been seen as leading late-nineteenth-century Scottish poetry into the sentimental parochialism of the Kailyard school.M. Lindsay and L. Duncan, The Edinburgh Book of Twentieth-Century Scottish Poetry (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , pp. xxxiv‚Äìxxxv. Poets from the lower social orders who used Scots included the weaver-poet William Thom (1799‚Äì1848), whose his \\"A chieftain unknown to the Queen\\" (1843) combined simple Scots language with a social critique of Queen Victoria's visit to Scotland. Walter Scott (1771‚Äì1832), the leading literary figure of the era began his career as a ballad collector and became the most popular poet in Britain and then its most successful novelist.A. Calder, Byron and Scotland: Radical Or Dandy? (Rowman & Littlefield, 1989), , p. 112. His works were largely written in English and Scots was largely confined to dialogue or interpolated narrative, in a model that would be followed by other novelists such as John Galt (1779‚Äì1839) and later Robert Louis Stevenson (1850‚Äì1894). James Hogg (1770‚Äì1835) worked largely in Scots, providing a counterpart to Scott's work in English. Popular Scottish newspapers regularly included articles and commentary in the vernacular.William Donaldson, The Language of the People: Scots Prose from the Victorian Revival, Aberdeen University Press 1989. There was an interest in translations into Scots from other Germanic languages, such as Danish, Swedish and German. These included Robert Jamieson's (c. 1780‚Äì1844) Popular Ballads And Songs From Tradition, Manuscripts And Scarce Editions With Translations Of Similar Pieces From The Ancient Danish Language and Illustrations of Northern Antiquities (1814) and Robert Williams Buchanan's (1841‚Äì1901) Ballad Stories of the Affections (1866).J. Corbett, Written in the Language of the Scottish Nation: A History of Literary Translation Into Scots (Multilingual Matters, 1999), , pp. 116. Twentieth-century renaissance Edwin Morgan, poet, playwright and the first official Scots Makar In the early twentieth century there was a new surge of activity in Scottish literature, influenced by modernism and resurgent nationalism, known as the Scottish Renaissance. The leading figure in the movement was Hugh MacDiarmid (the pseudonym of Christopher Murray Grieve, 1892‚Äì1978). MacDiarmid attempted to revive the Scots language as a medium for serious literature in poetic works including \\"A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle\\" (1936), developing a form of Synthetic Scots that combined different regional dialects and archaic terms. Other writers that emerged in this period, and are often treated as part of the movement, include the poets Edwin Muir (1887‚Äì1959) and William Soutar (1898‚Äì1943), who pursued an exploration of identity, rejecting nostalgia and parochialism and engaging with social and political issues. Some writers that emerged after the Second World War followed MacDiarmid by writing in Scots, including Robert Garioch (1909‚Äì1981) and Sydney Goodsir Smith (1915‚Äì1975). The Glaswegian poet Edwin Morgan (1920‚Äì2010) became known for translations of works from a wide range of European languages. He was also the first Scots Makar (the official national poet), appointed by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004. Alexander Gray was an academic and poet, but is chiefly remembered for this translations into Scots from the German and Danish ballad traditions into Scots, including Arrows. A Book of German Ballads and Folksongs Attempted in Scots (1932) and Four-and-Forty. A Selection of Danish Ballads Presented in Scots (1954).J. Corbett, Written in the Language of the Scottish Nation: A History of Literary Translation Into Scots (Multilingual Matters, 1999), , pp. 161‚Äì4. The generation of poets that grew up in the postwar period included Douglas Dunn (born 1942), whose work has often seen a coming to terms with class and national identity within the formal structures of poetry and commenting on contemporary events, as in Barbarians (1979) and Northlight (1988). His most personal work is contained in the collection of Elegies (1985), which deal with the death of his first wife from cancer.\\"Scottish poetry\\" in S. Cushman, C. Cavanagh, J. Ramazani and P. Rouzer, eds, The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics: Fourth Edition (Princeton University Press, 2012), , pp. 1276‚Äì9. Tom Leonard (born 1944), works in the Glaswegian dialect, pioneering the working class voice in Scottish poetry.G. Carruthers, Scottish Literature (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2009), , pp. 67‚Äì9. Liz Lochhead (born 1947) also explored the lives of working-class people of Glasgow, but added an appreciation of female voices within a sometimes male dominated society. She also adapted classic texts into Scots, with versions of Moli√®re's Tartuffe (1985) and The Misanthrope (1973/2005), while Edwin Morgan translated Cyrano de Bergerac (1992).J. MacDonald, \\"Theatre in Scotland\\" in B. Kershaw and P. Thomson, The Cambridge History of British Theatre: Volume 3 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), , p. 223. The Scottish Renaissance increasingly concentrated on the novel, particularly after the 1930s when Hugh MacDiarmid was living in isolation in Shetland and many of these were written in English and not Scots. However, George Blake pioneered the exploration of the experiences of the working class in his major works such as The Shipbuilders (1935). Lewis Grassic Gibbon, the pseudonym of James Leslie Mitchell, produced one of the most important realisations of the ideas of the Scottish Renaissance in his trilogy A Scots Quair (Sunset Song, 1932, Cloud Howe, 1933 and Grey Granite, 1934), which mixed different Scots dialects with the narrative voice.C. Craig, \\"Culture: modern times (1914‚Äì): the novel\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 157‚Äì9. Other works that investigated the working class included James Barke's (1905‚Äì1958), Major Operation (1936) and The Land of the Leal (1939) and J. F. Hendry's (1912‚Äì1986) Fernie Brae (1947). From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, particularly associated with a group of Glasgow writers focused around meetings in the house of critic, poet and teacher Philip Hobsbaum (1932‚Äì2005). Also important in the movement was Peter Kravitz, editor of Polygon Books. These included Alasdair Gray (born 1934), whose epic Lanark (1981) built on the working class novel to explore realistic and fantastic narratives. James Kelman‚Äôs (born 1946) The Busconductor Hines (1984) and A Disaffection (1989) were among the first novels to fully utilise a working class Scots voice as the main narrator. In the 1990s major, prize winning, Scottish novels that emerged from this movement included Gray's Poor Things (1992), which investigated the capitalist and imperial origins of Scotland in an inverted version of the Frankenstein myth, Irvine Welsh's (born 1958), Trainspotting (1993), which dealt with the drug addiction in contemporary Edinburgh, Alan Warner‚Äôs (born 1964) Morvern Callar (1995), dealing with death and authorship and Kelman‚Äôs How Late It Was, How Late (1994), a stream of consciousness novel dealing with a life of petty crime. These works were linked by a reaction to Thatcherism that was sometimes overtly political, and explored marginal areas of experience using vivid vernacular language (including expletives and Scots dialect).

Forouhar‚Äôs art reflects her criticism of the Iranian government and often plays with the ideas of identity. Her artwork expresses a critical response towards the politics in Iran and Islamic Fundamentalism. The loss of her parents fuels Forouhar‚Äôs work and challenges viewers to take a stand on war crimes against innocent citizens. Forouhar's work has been exhibited around the world including Iran, Germany, Russia, Turkey, England, United States and more. Bibliography= Early life and education The daughter of political activist Parvaneh Forouhar (n√©e Eskandari) and politician Dariush Forouhar, Parastou was born in 1962 in Tehran, Iran. Her father critiqued the Iranian government and he founded and led the Hezb-e-Mellat-e Iran (Nation Party of Iran), which was a secular opposition party in Iran. Her parents were stabbed to death in their home in the November of 1998 by a secret operation of Iranian Intelligence service, which is widely known as the Chain Murder. This tremendously tragic loss left no choice for Parastou Forouhar to dedicate her life to revealing the atrocities of the Iranian state through her expressive art. Despite it now being more than 20 years since the incident, the state intelligence still impedes her from holding a public commemoration for her parents. She has been threatened by the intelligence service several times and was finally sentenced to 6 years of conditional prison in 2017. Parastou currently lives in exile in Germany, and her bold work has been widely displayed inside and outside of Iran. Parastou studied Art at the University of Tehran from 1984 until 1990, where she earned her B.A., she then continued to study at the Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung (High School for Design) in Offenbach am Main in Germany and went on to earn her M.A. in 1994.Parastou lives with her two children in Frankfurt Germany now.  Work  Forouhar's work is autobiographical in nature and responds to the politics that have shaped and defined contemporary Iranian citizenship both in Iran and abroad. She works within a range of media including site specific installation, animation, digital drawing, photography, signs and products. Through her work, she processes very real experiences of loss, pain, and state-sanctioned violence through animations, wallpapers, flipbooks, and drawings. Forouhar uses culturally specific motifs found within traditional Iranian arts such as Islamic calligraphy and Persian miniature painting to question the ways these forms can generate a lack of individual agency while adhering to a standardized understanding of beauty and cultural identity. The underlying meaning of her works are not visible at first. They look poetic, lines are smooth, blank colors are like the illustration of the books. At first glance, they are pleasant images seeming embellished with details of line marks and vivid colors. However, as one takes time with them and pays attention to the details, they find out the reality of what they are implying. One of her pieces Kahrizak Prison literally refers to an incident that happened in 2009 where a few of the protesters of the Green Movement were brought to a detainment called Kahrizak Prison and for a few months were harshly tortured and raped resulting in at least 5 deaths. This series of Parastou‚Äôs work was created in 2009 pointing out the cruel moments of the day. The form of butterfly is referring to her mother‚Äôs name, Parvaneh which means butterfly but it is not just about her; she references her mother as an example or a starting point and further expands it to a larger oppressed population; the work signifies a totality while it is focused on a specific incident. It also reminds of the butterflies installed in a butterfly collection where the butterflies had been murdered and their freedom of existence had been taken just to serve somebody‚Äôs desire. In 2012 she received the Sophie von La Roche Award in recognition for her work that confronts issues concerning displacement, gender and cultural identity. Solo exhibitions of Forouhar's work have been held at Stavanger Cultural Center, Norway; Golestan Art Gallery, Tehran; Hamburger Bahnhof - Museum fur Gegenwart, Berlin; City Museum, Crailsheim, Germany; and German Cathedral, Berlin. She has participated in group exhibitions at Schim Kunsthalle, Frankfurt; Frauenmuseum Bonn; Museum of Modern Art, Frankfurt; Neue Galerie am Landesmuseum, Joanneum, Graz, Austria; House of World Cultures, Berlin; Deutsches Hygiene-Museum, Dresden; Jewish Museum of Australia, Melbourne; Law Warschaw Gallery at Macalester College, Saint Paul; and Jewish Museum San Francisco. Her work can be found in the following permanent collections: The Queensland Art Museum, Queensland; Belvedere, Vienna; Badisches Landesmuseum, Karlsruhe; Museum of Modern Art, Frankfurt; and the Deutsche Bank Art Collection. In 2002, the Iranian Cultural Ministry censored Forouhar's photo exhibition, Blind Spot, a collection of images depicting a veiled, gender- neutral figure with a bulbous, featureless face. Forouhar chose to exhibit the empty frames on the wall on opening night instead of forgoing the show. Forouhar and her brother got involved in activism after their parents got brutally murdered and they weren't allowed to publicly mourn or speak out about their deaths. Her artwork critiques the Iranian government and focuses on examining her identity and culture. Forouhar has been featured in several art fairs including the Brodsky Center Fair, at Rutgers University in 2015, and Pi Artworks fair Istanbul/London, in 2016 and 2017 (she was at both locations: in Contemporary Istanbul and London).

Life  Between 1989‚Äì95 Grubinger studied at the Hochschule der K√ºnste Berlin where she worked with Valie Export and Katharina Sieverding. Her graduation project, C@C, or Computer Aided Curating (1993‚Äì95), provided a branching interface for visitors to explore a social network of artists. While Grubinger began her career with works that reflected and commented, in a pioneering manner, on the early development of the Internet, since the mid-1990s she has worked primarily in sculpture and installation. These phases are not, however, disconnected: her latter-day focus on materiality and space, not least social space and how it subliminally affects us, might be seen as a reaction to the immateriality of the online world. Grubinger‚Äôs method is primarily to focus on, and unsettle via various strategies, recognizable objects. Her scope in this regard is wide: she draws inspiration and iconography from such diverse worlds as seafaring, history, architecture, the theatre of politics, and the recent history of art itself, particularly Minimalism and Conceptualism. As a sculptor she has worked, accordingly, in numerous different formats and materials. Typically, however, Grubinger‚Äôs approach is to take subjects that we might be familiar with, even to the point of no longer ‚Äòseeing‚Äô them, and alter their scale, context and material, often with attention to surfaces ‚Äì for surfaces, and their deceptions, are a strong part of her interest ‚Äì so that they register anew. As she works, the familiar comes to reveal not only itself but also its subtle, often politicised workings on body and mind.Carson Chan, in: Decoy, Landesgalerie Linz and Kerstin Engholm Galerie Vienna, Sternberg Press, Berlin, 2012 In the 1990s and 2000s Grubinger had numerous residencies in Cologne, Stockholm, Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles.

Early life and education Doris Porter Caesar was born in Brooklyn. Caesar attended Miss Chapin's School before transferring to the Spence School and the Art Students League, where she studied under George Bridgman. In 1913, she married and subsequently had three children. In 1925 she studied under Alexander Archipenko, under whom she developed her expressionistic approach to representing the female body. Doris' first solo show occurred in 1931 at the Montross Gallery. Work Caesar experimented with sculpting the female body in clay, bronze, and brass, often elongating the figures to be taller than human height. In 1927, she cast her first bronze, the primary material she would work with throughout her career. She took this bronze to E. Weyhe, a dealer on Lexington Avenue in New York City, who gave her access to his collection of German Expressionist artists. There, she was inspired by Ernst Barlach, Wilhelm Lehmbruck, and K√§the Kollwitz, whose work led her to turn away from classical forms and begin distorting the figures she sculpted until they were \\"stick-like.\\" Unfortunately, most of her work in the 1920s and 1930s was destroyed; the bulk of her major work was created in the following two decades after she moved to North Salem, New York and then to Litchfield, Connecticut, where she died in 1971.

He won two National Hunt Flat races and became a successful hurdler, winning the National Hunt Novices' Handicap Hurdle Final and the John Smith's Extra Cold Handicap Hurdle in 2007. He became more successful as a Steeplechaser, winning four Grade I races: the Royal and SunAlliance Chase, the Melling Chase and two runnings of the Ryanair Chase. His other wins included the Reynoldstown Novices' Chase, the Amlin 1965 Chase and the Old Roan Chase. Background Albertas Run is a dark-coated bay gelding with two white feet bred in Ireland by Oliver and Salome Brennan. He was sired by Accordion a son of Sadler's Wells who became a very successful National Hunt stallion, siring Flagship Uberalles, Dato Star (Christmas Hurdle) and Accordion Etoile (Ryanair Novice Chase). In 2004, the three-year-old gelding was sent to the Tattersalls Ireland sales where he has sold for ‚Ç¨20,000 to representatives of Highflyer Bloodstock. Albertas Run was sent into training with Jonjo O'Neill at his Jackdaws Castle stable at Temple Guiting, near Cheltenham in Gloucestershire. Racing career=2005/2006 National Hunt season Albertas Run began his racing career by competing in National Hunt Flat races. He made a successful debut at Haydock Park Racecourse in November, defeating fifteen opponents at odds of 5/1. He returned to the Lancashire course in January and won a similar event and took the lead inside the final furlong before winning by a head from Jobsworth and five others. He was then moved up sharply in class to contest the Grade I Champion Bumper at the Cheltenham Festival in March. Starting a 40/1 outsider, he was among the leaders in the early stages, but then dropped back and finished fifteenth of the twenty-three runners, more than seventeen lengths behind the Irish-trained winner Hairy Molly. 2006/2007 National Hunt season In the 2006/7 National Hunt season Albertas Run competed as a Novice Hurdler, winning on his debut over obstacles at Uttoxeter Racecourse in October. He then started 4/6 favourite for a Handicap at Haydock Park but finished fourth behind more experienced opponents. In January, the gelding carried 158 pounds in a handicap at Huntingdon Racecourse and won by three and a half lengths Hot Lips Page and ten others. Albertas Run's win at Uttoxeter qualified him for the final race of EBF Sunderlands National Hunt Novices' Handicap Hurdle series, a Grade III race run over two and a half miles at Sandown Park Racecourse on 10 March. Carrying 149 pounds and starting the 6/1 second favourite, he took the lead two hurdles from the finish and won by four lengths from Double Eagle. On his final appearance of the season, Albertas Run was moved up in distance and matched against more experienced horses in the John Smith's Extra Cold Handicap Hurdle (now a Grade III race) over three miles at Aintree Racecourse. The gelding took the lead between the last two hurdles and held on to win by half a length from Lyes Green. 2007/2008 National Hunt season Albertas Run began competing in steeplechases in the autumn of 2007, beginning with a nine length win when 2/5 favourite for a Novices' event at Towcester Racecourse in October. Later in the month he proved no match for Tidal Bay over two and a half miles at Aintree, being beaten twenty-two lengths into second place. He was moved up to three miles at Cheltenham in November and won \\"comfortably\\" from the Irish-trained Sizing Australia. On 16 February, Albertas Run was moved up in class to contest the Grade II Reynoldstown Novices' Chase over three miles at Ascot Racecourse and started third favourite at odds of 9/2 behind Air Force One and Joe Lively. Ridden by Ruby Walsh, he was restrained in last place before moving through the field to take the lead at the last fence and hon by one and three quarter lengths from Air Force One. At the Cheltenham Festival on 13 March, Albertas Run, ridden by A. P. McCoy started 4/1 favourite for the Grade I Royal and SunAlliance Chase. He was held up by McCoy in the early stages before moving to track the leaders four fences from the finish. He took the lead approaching the final fence and drew clear of the field in the closing stages to win \\"comfortably\\" by four and a half lengths from Roll Along. At Aintree a month later, Albertas Run was matched against the French import Big Buck's in the Mildmay Novices' Chase. He started the 6/4 favourite but was beaten eleven and three quarter lengths into third place by Big Buck's and Battlecry. 2008/2009 National Hunt season Albertas run failed to win in six races in the 2008/2009 National Hunt season but produced several good efforts in top-class steeplechases. In November he finished a distant fourth behind Tiday Bay in a race at Carlisle and was then pulled up when tailed off behind Madison du Berlais in the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury Racecourse. On 26 December, Albertas Run started a 25/1 outsider for the Grade I King George VI Chase at Kempton Park Racecourse. He was never able to challenge the winner Kauto Star, but took second place by half a length from Voy Por Ustedes, with the future Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Imperial Commander more than sixty lengths further back in sixth. In February, Albertas Run finished a distant third behind Madison du Berlais and Denman in the Grade II Levy Board Chase at Kempton. The gelding started at odds of 14/1 for the Gold Cup at Cheltenham and finished ninth of the sixteenth runners in an exceptionally strong renewal which saw Kauto Star win from Denman, Exotic Dancer and Neptune Collonges. In April he finished third to Madison du Berlais and Exotic Dancer in the Totesport Bowl at Aintree, but was pulled up behind Notre Pere in the Punchestown Gold Cup on his final appearance of the season. 2009/2010 National Hunt season On his first appearance of the next National Hunt season, Albertas Run was brought back in distance for the Grade II Amlin 1965 Chase over two miles three furlongs at Ascot. Ridden by McCoy he took the lead at the seventh fence and stayed on strongly to win by three and a half lengths from Planet of Sound, with Voy Por Ustedes in third and Monet's Garden in sixth. He then started second favourite for the Peterborough Chase at Huntingdon Racecourse but finished third, ahead of Tidal Bay, but eleven lengths behind the winner Deep Purple. Albertas Run's second attempt at the King George VI Chase was less successful than his first, as he finished sixth of the thirteen runners, almost seventy lengths behind Kauto Star. Albertas Run showed rather better form at Ascot on 20 February when he finished second to Monet's Garden in the Grade I Ascot Chase, one and a half lengths behind the winner. At the Cheltenham Festival started at odd of 14/1 for the Grade I Ryanair Chase over two and a half miles against a field which included Deep Purple, Planet of Sound, Voy Por Ustedes and Poquelin. Ridden by McCoy, he tracked the leaders before moving up to dispute the lead with Deep Purple before establishing a clear advantage at the fourth last fence. He went clear of the field approaching the second last fence and won by four and a half lengths from Poquelin. On 9 April McCoy rode Albertas Run in the Grade I Melling Chase over two and a half miles at Aintree. The gelding started at odds of 8/1 against ten opponents including Poquelin, Deep Purple, Monet's Garden and Forpadydeplasterer. Albertas Run tracked Monet's Garden before taking the lead four fences from the finish. He stayed on well in the closing stages to win by three and a quarter lengths from Forpadydeplasterer, with Monet's Garden in third. After the race, O'Neill praised the horse's performance saying \\"He had a hard race at Cheltenham... I thought we'd stay as long as he kept jumping. It worked out well. We are delighted, thrilled to bits with him\\" 2010/2011 National Hunt season Albertas Run showed little worthwhile form in the first half of the 2010/2011 National Hunt season. He finished a remote fourth to Monet's Garden in the Old Roan Chase at Aintree in October and the fell for the first time in his racing career at the third last fence in the Amlin 1965 Chase. In the King George VI Chase, delayed until 15 January 2011, he was pulled up after dropping out of contention in a race won by Long Run. Despite his unimpressive form, Albertas Run was made 6/1 second favourite when he attempted to win the Ryanair Chase for the second time on 17 March at Cheltenham. His opponents included Kalahari King, Poquelin, Voy Por Ustedes and Breedsbreeze. Albertas Run was among the leaders from the start before taking a clear advantage at the third-last fence and staying on strongly in the closing stages in the closing stages to win by a length from Kalahari King. At Aintree in April, Albertas Run was matched against the outstanding two-mile chaser Master Minded in the Melling Chase. He tracked the leaders in the early stages before moving up to challenge Master Minded, but was no match for the French-bred gelding and finished second, beaten nine lengths. 2011/2012 National Hunt season On his first appearance of the 2011/2012 season Albertas Run met Master Minded again in the Old Roan Chase on 22 October. Albertas Run led from the start and having been \\"shaken up\\" by McCoy approaching the third last fence, won by a length from Pure Faith, with Master Minded seven lengths back in third. The gelding did not reappear until March, when he attempted to win the Ryanair Chase for the third time. Starting at odds of 10/1, he disputed the lead from the start and went to the front three fences out but was overtaken fifty yards from the finish and beaten half a length by Riverside Theatre. In the Melling Chase at Aintree he made several jumping errors and after briefly taking the lead, was outpaced in the closing stages and finished third behind Finian's Rainbow and Wishfull Thinking. Eleven months after his last appearance, Albertas Run returned to Cheltenham and ran in the Ryanair Chase for the fourth time. He was close behind the leaders in the early stages but dropped out of contention and was pulled up in a race won by Cue Card. Albertas Run retirement was announced on 29 March 2013. It was announced that he would spend his retirement at Trevor Hemmings' Ballaseyr Stud on the Isle Of Man.

It is Iceland's largest maritime museum and the only Icelandic museum who has won the European Museum Award. The museum officially opened in 1994 in R√≥aldsbrakki, an old salting station which had been left abandoned after the collapse of the herring stock in 1969. Additionally two more buildings have been built for the museums exhibitions since then. Also, the museum owns the Old Slipway down by the harbour. Siglufj√∂r√∞ur used to be the center of the herring fisheries in Iceland, and the herring played a very large role in the nations economy and industry, providing as much as 44% of the nations export income during some years. History Many towns, villages and areas along the north and east coast of Iceland that were deeply affected by the arrival of the herring adventure but nowhere did the herring adventure have such an impact as in Siglufj√∂r√∞ur. Norwegian fishermen came sailing on their herring vessels during the summer of 1903, and thereby the Herring Adventure had started. Within forty years this once tiny little village had transformed into a thriving town of more than three thousand inhabitants. For years the entire life of Siglufj√∂r√∞ur centred on the herring catch and its processing - the town's twenty-three salting stations and five reducing factories were a living reminder of that. Siglufj√∂r√∞ur was also one of the most important ports in Iceland and on more than one occasion the herring exported from the town accounted for over 20% of the nation's total exports. As the herring adventure progressed, a goldrush-like atmosphere settled over the town, leading to Siglufj√∂r√∞ur been dubbed the \\"Atlantic Klondike\\". The town also became a magnet for herring speculators who came and went, some making a lot of money during the stay, and others not. With its booming industry, Siglufj√∂r√∞ur also became a mecca for tens of thousands of workers and labourers seeking employment. When bad weather and storms broke, the sheltered waters of the fjord became home to a massed fleet of hundreds of herring ships. Life on land was just as colourful, the streets of Siglufj√∂r√∞ur so jammed with crowds and activities that they resembled the teeming avenues of major cities. Marine resources are notoriously unstable, and herring is no exception. Following depressed catch figures in the years around 1950, herring stocks began to be fished as never before. This was due to a new and more efficient fishing technology developed by Icelandic pioneers. Other countries were quick in claiming these advances for themselves. It was during these years that more and more herring began to be caught in waters east of Iceland. In 1965 catches from east Iceland even eclipsed those from the usually productive waters north of Iceland due to the detrimental effects of cold seas. Almost overnight the old herring towns and villages of east Iceland flourished to become the new powers in this now giant industry. But this new age of herring prosperity was short-lived. In 1969 the herring simply failed to show up. The responsibility for over exploiting the once great Norwegian-Icelandic herring stock clearly lies with the then biggest herring fishing nations: Norway, Iceland and Russia. Iceland's herring towns, indeed the country's entire employment and economic sectors, suffered a severe blow with the disappearance of the herring. During the late 1960s, herring accounted for up to half of Iceland's export income, and was crucial in powering the country's dizzying economic growth. The great herring adventure was over. Siglufj√∂r√∞ur, as many other herring towns around the country was left without its main industry ‚Äì the collapse of the herring stock led Siglufj√∂r√∞ur to an era of depression and regression, with salting stations, bunkhouses, piers and so on being left abandoned and without a role. In 1989 a group of local volunteers formed an association, with their goal as to renovate the old building R√≥aldsbrakki, preserve the history of Siglufj√∂r√∞ur and its herring adventure. Many of those volunteers contributed significant amount of work to the rebuilding and development of R√≥aldsbrakki which took place between 1989 and 1996. The purpose of the museum is to tell the overall history of the herring industry in Iceland and also shed light on the important contribution of Siglufj√∂r√∞ur to the growth and progress of Iceland in the 19th and 20th centuries. The renovating and building of the museum has been very costly, plus all the volunteer work. The project of putting up The Herring Era Museum has been supported by the Icelandic government, the local municipality (Siglufj√∂r√∞ur ‚Äì later Fjallabygg√∞), various funds, companies, societies and individuals. Museum buildings and exhibitions Today the museum consists of three main museum buildings; R√≥aldsbrakki, Gr√°na and The Boathouse. R√≥aldsbrakki ‚Äì the old Norwegian salting station from 1907 exhibits the history of the Herring adventure. On the first floor guests will see all kinds of artifacts related to salting the herring into barrels and preparing them for export. The main floor has good historical explanations ‚Äì leading visitors to understand what a large part herring industry used to play in Iceland's history. Also visitors will get the chance to view amazing old photographs as well as movies shot in Siglufj√∂r√∞ur around the 1940s and those help visitors see things as the really were. Thousands of people flocked to Siglufj√∂r√∞ur each herring season in search for a well paid job; herring girls, fishermen and other workers. Hundreds of herring girls came from around the country to work during the summer, and they would be housed in the stations where they were employed. So on the upper floor the living quarters are still standing, untouched ‚Äì and it feels like the girls just ran out for work. Gr√°na ‚Äì a 1930s herring factory explains to visitors how those reducing plants transformed the herring into both meal and oil. The Gr√°na was built for the museum and opened in 2003. All the heavy machinery which is to be found in the exhibition was gathered from old, abandoned herring factories around the country - leading to the exhibition looking like a real, original factory. The Herring Museums website sais: \\"Our work has been to breathe life back into these ghost factories. [...] Our goal is to introduce the public to the heyday of Iceland's herring reduction industry, the 1930s ‚Äì 1950s. This is why we built Gr√°na, a large factory building modelled on the original Gr√°na herring reduction factory which operated in Siglufjordur between 1919 and 1950. [...] spending years dismantling piece by piece two of Iceland's most remote ghost factories (those at Ing√≥lfsfj√∂r√∞ur and Hjalteyri) and transporting everything back to Siglufj√∂r√∞ur [...] The Boathouse ‚Äì is the newest museum building, which was inaugurated by Crown Prince H√•kon of Norway on 29 June 2004. In the Boat House a little example of the town's bustling harbour has been recreated. Visitors can take a walk along the piers where ten boats and ships are docked, and you'll hear the sound of seagulls and waves breaking. Also, visitors are welcome to go on board the biggest herring vessel of the exhibition, which is very exciting. Apart from being a museum building, The Boathouse is occasionally used as a concert hall - where bands and artists use the biggest herring vessel as a stage, and chairs and benches are placed around the piers, allowing up to 250 people to enjoy a concert in amazing acoustic. The Old Slipway down by the harbour is an old boat building garage since the 1930s. It is a mix of an exhibition and an open workshop. The walls display the 200 years history of boat building in Siglufj√∂r√∞ur as well as various old tools used for wooden boat building, some of them being over 100 years old and still functioning. Also, the Old Slipway is a workshop, where both educated boatbuilders and amateurs can get permission to bring in their old boats for renovation, or even build new boats ‚Äì based on old Icelandic knowledge and methods. Salting demonstrations, or live exhibitions, are offered upon request or booking. They happen on the dock outside R√≥aldsbrakki museum building. Enjoying these shows, visitors are allowed to step back in time as the herring girls salt and pack herring into barrels, smoke their cigarettes and gossip about the handsome fishermen they met at yesterdays ball. Workers take away their full barrels and bring them new ones to keep on filling, while the accordion player uses his instrument to create the right atmosphere. Awards The Herring Era Museum in Siglufj√∂r√∞ur, Iceland, has won several awards: *The Tourist Board Innovation Award, 1998. *Honorary Recognition, Icelandic Parliament, 1999. *The Icelandic Museum Award, 2000. *INVEST ‚Äì Industrial Development Society Incentive Award, 2003. *The European Museum Award, The Micheletti Award, the best new industry museum in Europe, 2004. *Icelandic Tourist Board - Environment Award, 2017. Opening hours, entrance fees & visitor numbers May and September the museum is open daily from 13:00 ‚Äì 17:00 At summertime, June, July and August it is open daily from 10:00 ‚Äì 18:00 At wintertime, the museum is open by arrangement and upon request. Entrance fee is ISK 1800 for adults, ISK 1000 for seniors and students, and no fee is charged for children under 16 years old. Note that the ticket is valid for all museum buildings as well as for The Folk Music Center which is located close by the Herring Museum.

Her films concern the relationship between people and images, and how images structure people's perception of themselves and of reality. Early life and education Beckman earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts from Washington University in St. Louis in 1974 and attended the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program in 1975. She attended the California Institute of the Arts, originally as a visual artist, but later changed her focus to filmmaking. Career in filmmaking Beckman went to graduate school at CalArts in the late 1970s, and was influenced by the percussionist John Bergamo who taught there, and by Jack Goldstein's film loops. Beckman's early films were handmade and collaborative, integrating choreography, music, and singing, as well as sculptural objects. Her handmade cinematic effects have been compared to Fernand L√©ger's Ballet m√©canique (1921) or Hans Richter's Ghosts Before Breakfast (1928) and predated the visual technology of MTV and special-effects blockbuster films like Tron. Beckman stated about her early films, \\"As a young artist I was looking for a language to explain the relationship between the knowledge of one's self and movement in the physical world.\\" Beckman describes the subject matter of her films: \\"Film is creating a reality through the makeshift. My films move backwards, using narrative structures as does the mind of anyone trying to grasp the meaning of images in his memory.\\" The Super-8 films that Beckman created and exhibited prior to 1978, such as White Man Has Clean Hands (1977) and Hit and Run (1977), used basic prop-constructions and do-it-yourself special effects. After reading Swiss child psychologist Jean Piaget's Genetic Epistemology, Beckman began her \\"Super-8 Trilogy.\\" This trio of experimental films created between 1978 and 1980 included We Imitate; We Break Up (1978), The Broken Rule (1979), and Out of Hand (1980), and featured split screens superimpositions and ingenious pixilations. In these films Beckman used herself and a rotating cast, including James Casebere, Mike Kelley, Matt Mullican, James Welling, Kirby Dick, and Paul McMahon, as performers. The films combined childhood dream recollections with Piaget's ideas on the cognitive development of children. Beckman's \\"Super-8 Trilogy\\" demonstrated her ability to express her ideas using technical wizardry and poetic narrative. Out of Hand was one of the reasons the Whitney Biennial began to include Super-8 films. Beckman is also known for her 30 minute non-linear narrative film Cinderella (1986), in which the fairy tale character becomes part of a game as a metaphor for society's restrictions on women. The film starred Gigi Kalweit and Mike Kelley; Brooke Halpin composed the music, with vocals by Katy Cavanaugh. Beckman's later films include Switch Center (2003), which was shot in Hungary in an abandoned water purification plant. The film's mostly male characters move in choreographed constant motion as they interact with their industrial environment, referencing the compromised history of Soviet-style collectivism. Like other Pictures Generation artists, Beckman's films focus on the ways in which stereotypes shape an individual's self-image, revealing their origin in a generation raised on mass media. The kinetic movements of the actors are based on the \\"task-oriented\\" choreography of Lucinda Childs and Trisha Brown. Beckman's work has been shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Beckman's films Cinderella (1986) and You the Better (1983) were preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2017 and 2019, respectively.

Death and will The will of ‚ÄúPhilip Seyntclere Knight‚Äù was made on 16 May 1406. He directed that he be buried in the chancel of Penshurst parish church. The will was proved on 26 June 1408. A series of enquiries were held after his death to ascertain his property rights and the identity of his heir. These confirmed that Sir Philip held properties in Cambridgeshire, Kent, Leicestershire, Oxfordshire, Somerset, Suffolk, Surrey and Sussex.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 19, Nos. 453-464. The dates reported for his death at these hearings were 14, 16 and 18 May 1408. As his will was dated 16 May and writs to initiate the enquiries were dated 17 May, the only plausible date of those given for his death is 16 May. On 27 June 1408, the King charged Sir John Pelham 1000 marks for control of the manors, other property and the marriage of the heir(s) of Sir Philip St Clere until such time as an heir reached full age.

A significant figure in the Black British Art movement of the 1980s, Burman was one of the first British Asian female artists to have a monograph written about her work: Lynda Nead‚Äôs Chila Kumari Burman: Beyond Two Cultures (1995), and a second monograph by Nead was published in 2012. In 2018, Burman received an honorary doctorate from University of the Arts London for her impact and recognised legacy as a British and International artist. In 2020, Burman was selected into the Art Workers Guild as a Brother.  Early life  Born in Bootle, near Liverpool, Burman attended the Southport College of Art, the Leeds Polytechnic and Slade School of Fine Art, where she graduated in 1982. Her parents were Punjabi Hindus and they moved to the UK in the 1950s. This fact of biography has provided Burman with the means to critically examine the situation of South Asian women through herself, her family, her parents and her grandparents.  Career  Working across printmaking, painting, collage, film and photography, her work over four decades has been at the intersection of feminism, race and representation as activism and artwork. Her works ‚Äì particularly her prints from the 1980s ‚Äì were shown with other Black British artists and part of their political protest in the 1980s and 1990s against the police, against racism in British society and particularly stereotypes of South Asian women.'Critical Decade: Black British Photography in the 80s', Ten.8 vol. 2, no. 3, 1992 In 2018, Burman's contribution to British Art was recognised by the University of the Arts London, receiving an honorary doctorate alongside others such as Mike Nelson (artist), Gary Younge and Theaster Gates.\\"UAL to present 2018 honorary awards to world-leading creative figures\\", UAL, 5 July 2018. In the 1980s her work was shown in many black British artists shows from: Four Indian Women Artists (UK Artists Gallery, 1982); to Black Women Time Now (Battersea Arts Centre, London, 1983); The Thin Black Line (ICA, London, 1985); Black Art: New Directions (Stoke on Trent Museum and Art Gallery, 1989); and the feminist exhibition Along the Lines of Resistance (Rochdale Art Gallery and touring, 1989). In the 1990s and 2000s she and her work has explored her family history and her father‚Äôs work as an ice-cream seller in Bootle (in her exhibitions Candy-Pop & Juicy Lucy, Stephen Lawrence Gallery, University of Greenwich, London, 2006; Ice Cream and Magic, The Pump House, People‚Äôs History Museum, Manchester, 1997). In the 1990s, her work began to be shown internationally and she was in the Fifth Havana Biennale (1994); in Transforming the Crown (Studio Museum, Harlem and Bronx Museum, New York, 1997); Genders and Nations (with Shirin Neshat; Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell University, New York State, 1998). Her retrospective touring show, 28 Positions in 34 Years, went to Camerawork, London; Liverpool Bluecoat Gallery, Liverpool; Oldham Art Gallery; Huddersfield Art Gallery; Street Level Gallery, Glasgow; Cardiff Technical College, Cardiff; Watermans Arts Centre, London. In the 2000s, she has increasingly shown between UK and the Asian sub-continent, taking part in key feminist and South Asian women artists‚Äô exhibitions that explore the diaspora of South Asian identities: e.g. South Asian Women of the Diaspora (Queens Library, New York, 2001) and Text and Subtext (Earl-Lu Gallery, Lasalle-SIA University, Singapore, 2000) toured to Ivan Dougherty Gallery, Sydney, Australia, in 2000 and Ostiasiataka Museet (Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities) Stockholm, in 2001, Sternersenmuseet, Oslo, Norway, and Taipei Fine Arts Museum, Taiwan; X-ray Art Centre (Rui Wen Hua Yi Shu Zhong Xin), Beijing, China, in 2002 (exhibition catalogue). In 2018, Burman's survey show, Tales of Valiant Queens, was displayed at Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art. It brought together works made between the 1970s up to 2018, focusing on themes of female empowerment, social and political activism, folk traditions and colonial legacies. The show included many iconic pieces and new work, where it was reviewed as an exhibition that 'reflects her understanding of how contemporary British visual culture remains invested in the legacy of Empire, and shows how regressive definitions of identity have gone unchallenged in post-colonial Britain.  Writing/Publications  Alongside visual arts, Burman has written extensively on feminism, race, art and activism. In 1987, she wrote \\"There have always been Great Blackwomen Artists\\", exploring the situation of black women artists in relation to Linda Nochlin‚Äôs 1971 essay \\"Why have there been no Great Women Artists?\\" (first published in Women Artists Slide Library Journal no. 15 (February 1987) and then in Hilary Robinson (ed.), Visibly Female (London: Camden Press, 1987); also reproduced in Collective Black Women Writers, Charting the Journey: An Anthology on Black and Third World Writers (London: Sheba Publishers). Her work appeared on the bookjacket of Meera Syal's two novels on first publication: Anita and Me (Doubleday/Transworld, 1996); Life Isn't All Ha Ha Hee Hee (Doubleday/Transworld, 1999), as well as on the covers of James Proctor (ed.), Writing Black Britain, 1948-1998 (Manchester University Press, 2001); Roger Bromley (ed.), Narratives for a New Belonging: Diasporic Cultural Fictions (Edinburgh University Press, 2000); and Peter Childs and Patrick Williams, An Introduction to Post-Colonial Theory (Prentice Hall, 1998). Burman's work features in the 2018 exhibition publication No Colour Bar: Black British Art in Action 1960‚Äì1990, edited by Beverley Mason and Margaret Busby.\\"No Colour Bar: Black British Art in Action 1960-1990 catalogue\\", Diaspora Artists.
