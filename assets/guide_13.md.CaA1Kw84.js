It measures 131.2 cm by 229.2 cm and is now in the National Gallery in London. A rare example of a work painted for the artist's own pleasure rather than for a commission, it shows a view of the Het Steen estate near Brussels, which Rubens had acquired in 1635, set in an early-morning autumn landscape. He had initially intended to create a much smaller painting focusing on the house, using three small oak planks, probably spares from his studio, but as the concept developed, seventeen more panels were added. The painting has influenced artists including John Constable during his period working for Sir George Beaumont, who then owned the painting and later donated it to the National Gallery in 1823. The painting is notable for featuring the first convincing artistic depiction of a mackerel sky.

Design The chief reason for building the fortress was to protect the Pula harbour, the main Austrian naval port. It was one of the last fortresses built that used inner fortification rings, forming an arc within a radius of distance to protect the port. It was named after the Austrian admiral Anton Bourguignon von Baumberg. The fortress was inspired by the 1820 fortress design of Archduke Maximilian of Austria-Este for protecting Linz, Austria. Pula's fortresses differ from the original Linz fortress in that older fortresses built between the years 1851-1855 are smaller and less well- fortified than the ones built ten years later, like Fort Bourguignon. History Originally called Fort Monsival, it was built from 1861 to 1866, as a two-story circled fortress with a small circular courtyard in the center.Pula’s fortifications – impressive sights waiting to be discovered Fort Bourguignon It is not known when the fortress stopped being used as a fortification, but it was used during Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. Soon afterward, it was considered non-operational, but the damage on the roof shows that it was used during the First World War as an army shelter. In the 1970s, the protective channel was half filled with trash. Ten years later a group of young activists turned the fort into one of the two most popular places for rave parties on the southern Adriatic coast. Design The hallway faces the yard and expands through every floor, while 20 casemates form the outer shell of the fortress. The fort has three embrasures on the lower floor for rifles, and one embrasure on the upper floor for a cannon. The ceiling is supported by massive oak beams, which once divided the two floors in each casemate. Only a few remain. The roof of the fortress, which was able to rotate 360 degrees, served as a moving platform for artillery. The iron roof was probably constructed around the end of the 19th century. The entrance into the Fort was protected by the drawbridge over a moat and two caponiers. A wall offers a gallery and embrasures for the rifles. The standard armament of Pula's fortresses, and probably also in Fort Bourguignon, was weapons, the most famous Austrian cannon during the First World War.

Nader inspired the students to organize citizen action groups modeled after similar groups in Oregon and Minnesota. The Center for Student Action at St. Louis University and the Missouri Public Action Council at Washington University in St. Louis lobbied to establish a public interest research organization funded by a small assessment added to student activities fees. Student referenda on both campuses supported the fee assessment. The two student groups combined their operations and formed MoPIRG. MoPIRG's earliest campaigns included a successful appeal to the Federal Trade Commission to investigate deceptive advertising and sales practices by some St. Louis used car dealers in 1972. The group was also represented on the St. Louis Advertising Review Board, a self-regulatory board of the Advertising Club and the Better Business Bureau. MoPIRG gained national attention for its criticism of self-regulation by the advertising industry. MoPIRG also championed the right to representation for St. Louis City Jail prisoners. Their proposal led to the establishment of an ombudsman position by the St. Louis Department of Welfare in August, 1973. MOPIRG was active in campaigns to stop legislation that would raise the legal ceiling of small loan interest rates in Missouri, drafted a consumer protection ordinance presented to the St. Louis Board of Aldermen in September, 1973, and published research on a variety of consumer and citizen related issues. It researched and developed legislation that helped improve workers' compensation laws in Missouri and was also successful in stopping an effort to eliminate the public display rating system for area restaurants. From 1975 to 1981, MOPIRG developed a comprehensive revision of the state landlord-tenant law and successfully worked for its passage twice in the Missouri House of Representatives, although the bill was defeated both times in the Senate. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter attempted to reform the patronage system of judicial selection for the Circuit Court of Appeals. MOPIRG responded by forming a coalition of eleven political organizations, including the League of Women Voters and the NAACP, to urge Senator Thomas Eagleton to establish a merit nominating process on the state level. Senator Eagleton's resistance to this idea led MoPIRG to work successfully for legislation requiring the President to develop merit selection guidelines. Other issues MoPIRG has been involved with include requiring school testing services to make test results available to students, curbing utility rate increases, reforming media practices, and passing a national advisory referendum that would allow a non-binding public vote on government policy questions.

Dremel in 1932, the company is located in Racine, Wisconsin, US. Albert J. Dremel held 55 patents across a wide range of inventions, including an electric eraser, electric fish scaler, electric shoe polisher, electric screwdriver, power sanders, scroll saws, a device to monitor chicken's egg production, and first design of the now standard walk-behind rotary lawn mower. His first product released within the company was an electric razor- blade sharpener, which lost popularity when cheap disposable razors became available. Dremel then developed the high speed lightweight rotary tool, later named the Dremel Multitool, for which the company continues to be known. This invention was successful in the hobby and craft market. In 1948, Dremel gave his employees a 3% year-end share of profits, at the time seen as a radical idea. Dremel died on 18 July 1968 at the age of 81. People found many ways to use the rotary tools. In the 1940s the Defense Department reportedly used Dremel rotary tools in developing the first atomic bomb. Military doctors used the tools in dermal abrasion techniques to reduce scar tissue from battle wounds. Dremel tools are also used in tattooing. It is also used by podorthists for use on shoe inserts, and dentists use them for crafting dentures. Dremel said in 2013 that there were more than 17 million of their rotary tools in use.

Inspired by rural property-owners and right-wing factions, the protest forced the resignation of the civil governor and inspired a series of terrorist acts, that ultimately led to the creation of the Regional Junta of the Azores, and the basis of modern Azorean politics. History The protest was organized by large property-owners and landed gentry of the island of São Miguel that united hundreds of protesters. The principal motive of the gathering was to demonstrate agricultural issues, but mixed reactions against the left-leaning policies on the continent, and the desire to prevent progressive reforms in São Miguel. In particular, was a proposal by the anti-fascist Civil Governor of the Autonomous District of the Azores, António Borges Coutinho, and President of the Junta Geral, Álvaro Soares de Melo (both members of the MDP/CDE), to implement the reform of rural land rent policies and, possibly, the adoption of agrarian reforms imposed by the Ministry of Agriculture (). The possibility of freedom and democracy, promoted by the Movement of the Captains () brought to the Azores a perception that the time to reclaim political autonomy or even independence was at hand for some. The radical politics in the continent, with the spectre of nationalization, contributed daily to the feeling of confrontation, in an archipelago that was openly hostile to communism and leftist ideologies. The economic situation in the region was no better. In 1975, half of the population was involved in agriculture, and the nascent economy was asfixated by the price differential between the islands and the continent. Feed, fertilizer, cement and gas/oil were all influenced by cost of transport, inflation and the high margins fixed by commercial monopolies. High interest rates and low milk prices put the agricultural industries at risk: many of the farming families were desperate. =Event= Although the protest was prohibited in a joint communique by the Civil and Military Governors, it nonetheless went ahead.José Manuel Oliveira Mendes (2003) The Military Governor, General Altino Pinto de Magalhães, had indicated that a protest at that time was not prudent, owing to arrival of a NATO squadron at the city port, which could have been interpreted as a reaction to their presence. Members of the agricultural cooperatives were mobilized, with tractors and pickup trucks arriving from around the island, parading around the streets of Ponta Delgada. There were chants of \\"If you are Azorean come here!\\", including cries of \\"exploitation\\" and unequal treatment by continental Portuguese. The protest wound through streets, following the path of the annual festival of Senhor Santo Cristo dos Milagres, although veering off to the headquarters of the PCP at one point, to provoke the communists. The idea was made by the leaders of the protest, José Franco, Luís Indio, Armando Goyannes and Luís Franco, among others, linked to the independence movements like MAPA and, later, FLA. When the procession finally reached the Palace of Conceição, the first placards started to appear, appealing to Azorean freedom, mixed with cries of \\"Viva a independência dos Açores\\" (Long live the independence of the Azores). In addition, the main captains of the political arm of the FLA appeared, the lawyers Carlos Melo Bento and Abel Carreiro. It was at that time that the protest took on a character of separatism: \\"We need to be free...we need to demonstrate that the Azores are able to auto-govern themselves....This protest is for independence and is just\\"! By this time, the first military interventions in the protest, in order to block the crowd, but protesters were able to enter the Civil Governor's offices. Within the Palace, after a few moments of tension, the protesters demanded the head of Governor Borges Coutinho, the political symbol of the \\"communist threat\\" from the continent. This was the main reason for Luís Franco, and other leaders of the protest: to demand his resignation. António Borges Coutinho appeared at the top of the staircase, and received a delegation from the protesters to discuss their demands. During the course of this discussion, Coutinho was interrupted by the Military Governor, who affirmed that the Civil Governor should resign, in order to put an end to the protests. Coutinho, losing his power base by the Military Governor, therefore resigned publicly on the veranda of the Palace of Conceição. =Aftermath= A series of protests occurred in simultaneity with the events (but were likely planned earlier), including the occupation of the headquarters of the regional radio station (ERA) and the main post office, as well as the blockade of the runways of Ponta Delgada's airport. The Military Governor ordered the imprisonment of the principal individuals allegedly responsible for the acts, resulting in the detention of approximately 29 of the participants. The majority of the people rounded up by local security forces were linked to the political right, some separatists/independentists or fascists, who were imprisoned in Angra do Heroísmo, including: * Abel da Câmara Carreiro (1916–2006), a sexagenarian lawyer, who was apprehended in the morning at his home, on Rua Dr. Armando Cortes Rodrigues (Ponta Delgada), who was a jurist and founder of the Movimento de Autodeterminação do Povo Açoriano (Movement for the Auto-determination of the Azorean People), who participated along with General Altino de Maglhães in the forced resignation of the Civil Governor, in the Palace of Conceição (and tried to prevent violent reprisals); * Aguinaldo da Silva Almeida Carneiro (26 June 1951 – 15 March 1999), captured at 3:30 in the morning, by soldiers who were once instructees, at his home on Rua Teófilo Braga in Ponta Delgada, even as his wife was expecting their first child. Noting the stress that this would cause, he proposed to the soldiers that they should arrest him on Rua da Vila Nova de Baixo, while she was sent to her father's home. He was an active organizer and protester during 6 June, who entered the Palace and took to the veranda with the Civil Governor, when he resigned; * Álvaro Pereira Branco Moreira was arrested at home on Rua dos Prestes de Baixo, one of the few prisoners who were unjustly detained, in place of his brother Rui, who was intimately involved in the protest and FLA; * António Brum de Sousa Dourado, from a monarchist family and anti-communist, was arrested at his home on Rua Carvalho Araújo in Ponta Delgada, for his involvement as an active protest organizer, founder of the MAPA and its signatory to its manifesto (while his son, painted in black, had improvised a fire in front of the barracks, in a provocative preparatory action before 6 June); * Antônio Clemente Pereira da Costa Santos, Counsel of France, was also arrested at his home on Rua Dr. Bruno Carreiro (Ponta Delgada), in the presence of his wife and children, by soldiers who had followed the couple into their home (and bathroom). A relatively wealthy man, having inherited a great fortune, his role was small, although he was loathed by some local militants, he was one of the first to be freed after eight days of jail. During his sentence, the French crew of naval ship docking in Ponta Delgada were surprised, since the Counsel, who should have been waiting, was not in attendance: representatives traveled to the square in Angra do Heroísmo where they waited until he was freed; * António José do Amaral was arrested at 2:00 in the morning, at Rua do Diário dos Açores by a Sergeant and PSP officer; member of the MAPA, he was contacted before the protest by Rainer Daehnart, art dealer and active supporter of anti-communists forces. He was interrogated in the barracks in Ponta Delgada various times, for comments, threats and digressions made about Azorean independence during a Christmas dinner party, where he was denounced by a lieutenant in Fiscal Guard; * António Manuel Gomes de Menezes, captured on Rua Dr. Armando Narciso, in the Bairro da Vitória, by a platoon of 12 nervous armed soldiers, captained by a marine sergeant, son- in-law of Floriberto Rodrigues. When captured, he and his wife had returned after a dinner with António Costa Santos, and their children were already asleep: when arrested he was counseled to bring a razor. António Menezes, participated in the protests, was a member of MAPA and FLA, and days earlier had accompanied Commander Eduardo Pavão, when he distributed independence pamphlets around Ponta Delgada, aboard a small airplane of the Aeroclube de S. Miguel; * António Nuno Alves da Câmara, a young Azorean ex-military, was spirited from his house in Abelheira (Fajã de Baixo), by armed military: an active member of FLA, Câmara and his father animated the protest on 6 June, with this popularity, but he always remained isolated and alone in his prison cell; * Armando Guilherme Goyanes Machad, was arrested in his Rua de Santana home in Ponta Delgada, and was known for his visceral anti-communist leanings; * Bruno Tavares Carreiro was the son of a historical autonomist, arrested with his father, open independentists and high within the hierarchy of the FLA, he reacted negatively while in prison and proudly criticizing severely the others responsible (particularly Magalhães and Ricou). * Carlos Eduardo da Silva Melo Bento, a 33 lawyer, was captured after one in the morning, by various soldiers commanded by a sergeant from Ginetes, friend and supporter of Marcelo Caetano's ANP. He was taken from his four children and wife on Rua da Cruz in Ponta Delgada, and imprisoned aboard a lighthouse ship, before being transported to Terceira. Liberated 15 days later, from popular pressure, for several years he was dedicated to Azorean independence, joining FLA for some time: although he had no involvement in the protest, he did support the sentiments of the protesters. * Commandant Eduardo José Pereira de Almeida Pavão (30 November 1946 – 7 July 1999) was a pilot for SATA Air Açores, and colleague of General Diogo Neto, member of the National Salvation Junta. He was imprisoned after being rounded-up on 10 June (along with Mont'Alverne and Tomás Caetano), around 1:00 in the afternoon by a sergeant and four soldiers. He was a member of the executive council of FLA, when José d'Almeida became its president, to whom he was loyal until his death: all the clandestine actions of FLA was signed off by him, including the protest. He was primarily responsible for the nationalist pamphlet campaign, flying his personal plane and dropping the pamphlets on the island; * Fernando Manuel Mont'Alverne de Sequeira, also captured during 10 June round-up, he was picked up from his home on Rua de Lisboa, and imprisoned by armed forces at the PSP command post, along with Eduardo Pavão; * Gualberto Borges Cabral, was an active organizer and proponent of the protest, as well as member of the FLA and right-wing monarchist, played a role in the Movimento Nacionalista Açoriano (Azorean Nationalist Movement). He was arrested at his residence on Rua Coronel Chaves, leaving behind his widowed mother in a state of despair, a fact that he never forgave his accusers. * Gustavo Manuel Soares Palhinha Moura, journalist for Açoriano Oriental, was arrested after publicizing the acts of the event: he was arrested at night, at his residence along the Estrada Regional da Ribeira Grande; * João Gago da Câmara, personally wealthy, the enthusiastic independentist, was apprehended at his home on Rua do Castilho; imprisoned, he eventually travelled to the United States, then returned, before holding the office of President of the municipality of Ponta Delgada for 10 years; * João Luis Soares Reis Índio, a farmer, along with his father and brother, was responsible for requesting the Civil Governor announce his resignation on the balcony of the Palace of Conceição; * João Manuel Furtado Rodrigues, businessman and farmer, was arrested in the early hours of the morning, along Rua do Colégio; although he eventually went to live in Brazil, his businesses and popular Café LYS were places used by the FLA conspirators; * Técnico José Joaquim Vaz Monteiro Vasconcelos Franco (1929‑1988), was part of the founding members of the MAPA and FLA, and was arrested at his home on Rua dos Mercadoeres; * José Manuel Duarte Dominques, was not apparently involved in organizing the protest, he did participate in clandestine independence meetings, in Cabouco, at the home of Paul de La Bletiére, a right-wing Franco- Algerian, but was more known for his graffiti tagged all over São Miguel, even as he defended the cause; * José Nuno de Almeida e Sousa (1942–1980), a young lawyer, he was a conservative, anti-communist and jurist for the MAPA, arrested at this home on Ladeira de Santa Rita Fajã de Baixo by the army, witnessed by his family; * Luis Manuel Duarte Domingues, along with his brother, was arrested for their anti-communist acts, and for occupying the regional ERA radio station (later RDP), along with Luís Franco, taking over the installation and broadcasting their manifesto, as well as several episodes of Azorean-flavored music; * Luis Maria Duarte Moreira (1920–1996), anti- communist, was arrested at his home on Rua dos Manaias, even as he was a continental Portuguese, he defended Azorean independence, joining the \\"Royal\\" group, but inevitably living in the United States after the events of the protest; * Luis Octávio dos Reis Índio, along with his father and brother, was arrested at his home in Pópulo, after participating with the group occupied the radio station, signing the manifesto and involving himself with the LYS group; * Luis dos Reis índio (1918–1994), along with his sons, he entered the Palace of Conceição to pressure the Governor to resign, and participated in the negotiations with General Altino, at the garrison Fort of São Brás. He was arrested at his home in Pópulo, by a Sergeant and armed soldiers. * Luís Ricardo Vaz Monteiro Vasconcelos Franco, along with his brother, he was one of the more active protestors: co-author of the groups manifesto, read out at the ERA radio station, and visible on the varanda of the Palace during the Governor's resignation. He was arrested in Atalhada, along Canada das Mercês, at four in the morning; * Manuel Oliveira da Ponte, one of the organizers, he was arrested at this home along Rua Ilha Terceira in the Bairros Novos area of Ponta Delgada, for his role between José de Almeida and Paul de La Bletiére; * Manuel da Ponte Tavares Brum (1924–1989), farmer and businessman, he was an active participant in the protest and apprehended at this home on Rua Bernardo Manuel da Silveira Estrela, in Ribeira Seca, for his role in occupying the airport; * Valdemar de Lima Oliveira, who participated in the occupation of the radio station and the protests, he was present at the negotiations with General Altino, in his role for the MAPA and FLA; * Tomaz Faria Caetano, a successful Portuguese émigré, Caetano returned from Canada, and constructed a chalet (Mountain Dream) in the hills atop Furnas. He was remembered for being the first to be liberated, owing to his Canadian citizenship, and the fact that he suffered from claustrophobia (forcing his jailers to keep the cell door open) and who wore a white suit, hat and shoes during the protest. * Victor do Carmo Cruz, the highest-ranking Portuguese representative at the American consulate, who never hid his antipathy for the communists who had influence in the national government, supporting the Azorean manifesto. In addition, a small band of friends were arrested on Terceira, aligned with the movement: José Manuel Rodrigues dos Santos (from FIAT), José Silvério Bispo (businessman and photographer from Praia da Vitória), Luís Soares Guiod de Castro (aristocrat and businessman from Angra do Heroismo) and Paulo Tadeu Mendes Brum Pacheco. The latter was able to convince his jailers to liberate him for the weekend, so that he could participate as best-man during a wedding. Many of the arrested maintained a level of optimism and humor, even as there was no certainty that incarceration would be short-term. Although, much later, various detainees publicly assumed responsibility for their participation in subversive acts, their court cases were dismissed without proof and archived. Meanwhile, the Civil Governor of the Autonomous District of Angra do Heroísmo, Oldemiro Cardoso de Figueiredo, also of the MDP/CDE, resigned a few weeks after the protests, in solidarity with Borges Coutinho. From June to August 1975, there was a rise of terrorist-oriented acts. Various deputies of the MDP/CDE ad the PCP were obliged to abandon the Azores in August. The \\"deportation\\" of communist supporters to the continent was front- page news in the Diário de Notícias, then a mouthpiece of the government in Lisbon. =Autonomy= Despite the meaningful political environment on the Continent and the unequivocal condemnation of the demonstration organized by the \\"reactionary\\" islanders of São Miguel, the national government, then headed by General Vasco Gonçalves, determined the need to form a Regional Junta of the Azores, to replace the administration of the three districts of the Azores. The creation of the Regional Junta of the Azores was originally proposed by the Grupo dos Onze (Group of Eleven), presided by former Civil Governor Borges Coutinho (in January 1975). Though, not attributable to the protests, due to their reactionary nature, the events did not contribute positively to the process of autonomy, which would be discussed in the Constituent Assembly. Later, antagonisms over the demonstrations only appeared on 19 March 1976, when deputy Vital Moreira (PCP) questioned Américo Natalino de Viveiros (PPD), as to the reason for a statement made, regarding the media of Ponta Delgada. Responding, Natalino de Viveiros stated: :\\"...the manifestation of 6 June, was to end the dictatorship that was located in the Azores, created by former Governor Borges Coutinho, ruling as a despot...without any respect for the popular will, and that is why this manifestation occurred,...and that is also why there existed those minorities that I mentioned, that could steer the people to take less worthy actions, that were not within the spirit of these populations.\\" These statements, after the PPD in São Miguel had not campaigned for the resignation of the Civil Governor after the 1975 elections, resulted in a response by Orlando Marques Pinto (MDP/CDE), against the insults made to Borges Coutinho, affirming his \\"anti-fascist resistant, paid for with many years in prison and permanent humiliation, while I do not know at that time what you \\"Mr. Deputy\\" did, with that affirmation.\\" The writer Christopher de Aguiar described the events of 6 June 1975 in his diary: \\"It is foolhardy to assume that three or four thousand voices shouting for more to do, in the name of a whole people or an entire island that has more than one hundred thousand inhabitants. This is reminiscent of last century's alevantes (1869) where the people defended the interests of their masters and not their own. Yet, 6 June was also, no exception. Three or four thousand protesters were, for the most part, gathered in rural areas by large landowners, to serve as echo (a sad vocation) to the interests of their lords and masters...Democracy, which cost \\"the eyes off your face\\" to be won, sometimes these have perverse effects. Indeed, the active minority that oppress and oppressed the people of São Miguel always existed...it was the same that expressed their side in Ponta Delgada on 6 June.\\" On 7 June 1978, José António Martins Goulart, leader of the PS parliamentary group in the Regional Legislative Assembly, affirmed: :\\"6 June...is a date [that affirmed] that nothing is [more] real and important to the people of these islands, and that [they] will have nothing to do with alleged spontaneous popular reactions...Rather, it represents the expression of a single totalitarian threat that was never eradicated from this earth. It represents, after yesterday, another stage of the liberation of a people, that on these islands know how to answer the melancholy of the past.\\" Reaction The director of the newspaper Açores, Gustavo Moura, former adherent of the Legião Portuguesa and Acção Nacional Popular, defended the protests, in an editorial in which the principal objective was the support for separatism, was also imprisoned (but he was never tried for his fascist rant nor forced to resign his post). The weekly newspaper O Açoriano Oriental, then directed by Luciano Mota Vieira, was more pragmatic, noting that the Civil Governor had requested to be replaced after the Portuguese Democratic Movement (MDP/CDE) lost local elections, and was demoted by the Minister of the Internal Administration, major António Arnão Metelo. Of the remaining newspapers, the daily Correio dos Açores, with the same fascist slant (and comprising former Salazarists Gaspar Henriques and Manuel Ferreira), supported the protest, as this excerpt suggests (reprinted on 6 June 2010): \\"...6 June 1975/Grandioso protest/Historic mark in the life of the Azores/Dr. Borges Coutinho requested to resign from the position of Civil Governor of the district...the population protested, in an unsophisticated way, its desire. Thousands of people, hundreds of vehicles, an entire island, raised their voices and, against all prohibitions, organized one of the more grandiose and significant protests in history. The cries of independence soon surpassed all other claims. The grave problems of farming, the demand for the resignation of the district chief, everything quickly became a backdrop to the cries for independence.\\"Correio dos Açores (6 June 1975), p.1 Meanwhile the Diário dos Açores and the weekly A Ilha were more pragmatic. The media in Lisbon, in comparison, condemned the protests. A couple of days later, the same \\"independence\\"-oriented commentaries continued to permeate the Correio dos Açores, with characterizations of the psychological, linguistic, cultural, historical and economic differences between the Azores and the continent, justifying a break with Lisbon. Moreover, there was an indication that the social stratification and beliefs that existed between the two regions were distinct enough to talk of a Azorean people, whose moral authority was not convergent with the Portuguese people. This text went on to exclaim: \\"An exalted word of the moment will follow the words reflected at this historic hour we're living. And this will not be the final word of a few, but of all Azoreans who want it their endeavor and their ability, at present, to make the future.\\" The Socialist Party (PS), Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), the Portuguese Democratic Movement (MDP/CDE) and the MES condemned the protests, promoting a counter-protest for the following week, on 16 June. The Social Democratic Party (PPD), although a principal supporter of the original protest, also supported the counter-protest, to distance themselves from the subversive acts of 6 June demonstration. The PS, released a public statement in the newspaper A Capital, in Lisbon, on 12 June 1975, distancing themselves from the \\"reactionary character that was imprinted on the untimely manifestation, that was so skillfully called for by some farmers on São Miguel...[while supporting]...the strong measures taken by the MFA, to ensure the continuity of the revolutionary process in São Miguel, neutralizing the harmful actions of reactionary minority groups who, treacherously plotted against national sovereignty.\\" At the same time, the PS indicated their antagonism towards the MDP/CDE Civil Governors, named in the rest of the country. The MDP/CDE, for its part, asked for an \\"immediate and severe punishment for the peoples responsible for the protest, and for the shameful disrespect that for a while had been verified, and had multiplied, and intensified after the demonstration on 6th.\\" The Popular Party (then forerunner of the PSD), through some of its more notable speakers, such as Américo Natalino de Viveiros (a militant on the extreme-right of the party, and involved in the protest), affirmed in the official communique: :\\"The people of São Miguel held a demonstration on 6 June, [with] as we believed, only with the intention of finding a solution to a number of problems, that had been dragging-on without having been resolved by the competent authorities.\\" Referring to the objectives of the protest, the underlined that it was, \\"only opportunist groups, that distorted the purity of this mass movement, grafting on them the echo of prejudicial slogans harmful to the dignity of the Portuguese people.\\" The PPD affirmed that \\"no to separatism, though we strive for an autonomous statute\\", appealing \\"to people to remain aware of reactionary maneuvering, to organize a popular surveillance and not to allow [this type] of vested interests, be they individuals or groups, or the economic policy of the landlords and property-owners in the district, that want to keep and maintain the exploitative privileges of the people.\\" It is necessary to understand that the Social Democratic Party was a center-left political party, and candidate for the Socialist International, since its interim leader (in the absence of Francisco Sá Carneiro) the professor Emídio Guerreiro, one of the major personalities of the democratic opposition in Portugal. Meanwhile, on São Miguel, the situation was dissimilar, since the PPD, under João Bosco Mota Amaral, was in practice a conservative and post-fascist partyJosé Andrade (2011) =Revisionism= Many of the regional right-wing reactionaries, especially those on São Miguel, sought to mystify the importance of the date, suggesting how they allegedly played a major role in bringing about political and administrative autonomy in 1976. But, even as the PS promoted their view in the press of Ponta Delgada, the media was dominated then by journalists linked to the political right, such as Gustavo Moura, who accomplished a lot while heading the Açores much like the Açoriano Oriental. The Correio dos Açores, which was transformed into an official mouthpiece of PSD reactionary forces and the Micalense extreme- right separatists: during the directorship of Jorge do Nascimento Cabral (between 1981 and 1999), an avowed separatists member of the PSD, and Américo Natalino de Viveiros (after 1999).Jorge do Nascimento Cabral, was a former militant of the FLA, became an avowed separatist from June 1989, affirming that \\"autonomy is a transition to independence\\", which resulted in his censure by the legislature of the Azores. Yet, he was not denounced by national governing body of the PSD, which would have meant his expulsion from the party, since he espoused ideas that were against national unity. Cabral defended his separatist interpretation of autonomy within his newspaper. Under the direction of Gustavo Moura, the Açoriano Oriental republished a commemorative 25th anniversary edition of the Açores (from 7 June 1975) on 6 June 2000, with the editorial that sent Moura to prison. In comparison, during the 25th anniversary celebrations of the Carnation Revolution, the newspaper never re-published the comparable facsimile celebrating the foundations of the democratic government. On 6 June 2000 editorial, headlined \\"Unity, An Example Not to Forget\\", where the author cited the Regional Government of the Azores, under PS leader Carlos César, for marking the protest date, he promoted the alleged \\"historical dimension\\" of the events. For many, though, the date held some importance, as with the proposal by Ponta Delgada councilman Carlos Rego Costa (PSD), who succeeded in having the Rua dos Chagas renamed Rua 6 de Junho (approved in 1979), in direct opposition to opposition members of the Socialist Party (who voted against the measure). Yet, the name persisted and no move was made to replace it, since its adoption. On 29 September 2011, a Facebook page was started to promote the movement to replace the Rua 6 de Junho for Rua Marechal Humberto Delgado in Ponta Delgada, in reverence to the assassinated posthumous-Marshall of the Portuguese Estado Novo state, who was murdered by people associated with the Salazar government. On 28 May 2012, members of the Frente de Libertação dos Açores (FLA) announced their intention to commemorate the 37 years following 6 June protests, to \\"show the strength of the Azoreans\\" and show homage \\"those who had contributed to liberty\\". Álvaro Lemos, during a press conference, stated \\"6 June was the cry of liberation for the Azorean population from a new dictatorship of the left\\", noting that thousands of people were mobilized on that date in a rare event to force the resignation of the Civil Governor, António Borges Coutinho. The independents' commemorations served to indicate \\"that autonomy is frayed\\" and the \\"disunity of the islands\\" suggesting that \\"political parties don't defend the Azores and only look at their navels...[while] autonomy is a certification for the incapacity of Azoreans to govern themselves appropriately.\\" References ;Notes ;References    Category:1975 protests Category:1975 in Portugal Category:June 1975 events in Europe ","title":"6 June 1975 Micalense Farmers' Protest"},{"id":"40187204","text":"The West Midlands shown in England There are over 20,000 Grade II* listed buildings in England.

The garden was created first, by garden designer Gertrude Jekyll, and became widely known through her books and prolific articles in magazines such as Country Life. The Arts and Crafts style house, in which Jekyll lived from 1897 to 1932, was designed by architect Edwin Lutyens to complement the garden. Munstead Wood was the first in a series of influential collaborations between Lutyens and Jekyll in house and garden design. The number of these collaborations has been put at around 120;Brown (1990), pp. 141–144. other well known ones include Deanery Garden in Berkshire and Hestercombe House in Somerset.Plumptre (1994), p. 60. The entire original area of Jekyll's property is grade I listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Since Jekyll's time, it has been divided into six plots with different owners. The main house, which retains the name of Munstead Wood and whose plot contains most of the original gardens, is a grade I listed building. The properties in the other plots, which are to the north and west of the main house, also include listed buildings designed by Lutyens, in the lesser two categories; these were mostly Jekyll's outbuildings. Garden Archway to summer garden, 2009 Jekyll purchased Munstead Wood in 1882 or 1883,Tankard (2011), pp. 23–24. just across Munstead Heath Road from Munstead House,Nairn, Pevsner and Cherry (1995), pp. 377–378. where she had been living with her mother since 1878. A part of Munstead Heath, Munstead Wood was a triangular area in total, sloping upwards from its north-west corner, which was a sandy field, to of former Scots pine woodland,Brown (1982), p. 33. on heath soil. Jekyll transformed Munstead Wood gradually over many years. She allowed the felled woodland to grow back, but thinned the young trees,Plumptre (1994), p. 59. creating areas of different varieties and different combinations of varieties,Brown (1982), pp. 50–51. and gave each area its own underplantings of flowers and shrubs. The resulting woodland garden was viewed via a series of long woodland walks. Nearer the house the woods merged gradually into lawns. Seasonal gardens flowered in succession through the year: the \\"spring garden\\", the \\"hidden garden\\", the \\"June garden\\",Brown (1982), p. 38. and the main herbaceous border, long, which flowered from July until October.Brown (1982), pp. 44–45. Each garden displayed carefully arranged shades of colour.Tankard (2011), pp. 28–29. The Tank north of the house, 1921 Jekyll turned the lower field into a kitchen garden. There was also a plant nursery from which she supplied plants to her clients. She also bred improved varieties of plants such as Munstead bunch primroses.Massingham (1966), p. 105. The garden of Munstead Wood became widely known as a result of Jekyll's descriptions and photographs, in her books such as Wood and Garden (1899), Home and Garden (1900),Massingham (1966), p. 69. and Colour in the Flower Garden (1908), and in her many articles, particularly in Country Life and William Robinson's magazines The Garden and Gardening Illustrated.Tankard (2011), p. 38. William Robinson was a frequent visitor.Massingham (1966), p. 79. Jekyll's long relationship with Country Life began when proprietor Edward Hudson first visited Munstead Wood in 1899. Her garden was notably recorded in Country Life in subsequent years by photographer Charles LathamTankard (2011), pp. 14–15. and Herbert Cowley. The Gardens were written up and extensively photographed in 'English Gardens' by Henry Avray Tipping, (published by Country Life. 1925) at page 239 of that book. The gardens attached to the main house have been privately restored. Public viewing of the gardens is possible by arrangement. House House ground floor plan At Jekyll's first meeting with Lutyens in 1889 she invited him to Munstead Wood, and their collaboration began. They explored the local vernacular architecture, gathering ideas for the construction of Jekyll's house.Brown (1996), pp. 26–29. His first building for her was The Hut,Tankard (2011), pp. 32–35. a cottage built in the grounds of Munstead Wood in 1895. Jekyll used this as a workshop, and lived in it until Lutyens completed the main house in 1897. While the house was still being built, Lutyens obtained another, larger commission in Surrey, Orchards, as a result of his future clients being impressed with Munstead Wood when they happened to walk past the construction site.Brown (1982), pp. 55–56. Jekyll lived at Munstead Wood until her death in 1932. The house was built in a U-shape around a courtyard open on its north side. The west wing contained Jekyll's workshops, and to the east lay a service wing. On the house's south, garden elevation, the tiled roof extends down to the top of the ground floor, broken by two large gables.Gradidge (1981), pp. 27–31. On the right of this elevation, a narrow, south-projecting porch wing has an arch, the house's main entrance, on its east side, where this wing forms a continuation of the house's east facade.Richardson (1981), pp. 73–74. View from north, with central garden court and overhanging gallery, 1900 The house was built of local Bargate stone, lined inside with brick. The casement windows were set flush with the outside walls to maximise the internal window sills. Oak timbers were extensively used. These were obtained from local oaks,Ridley (2002), pp. 71–72. silvered using a treatment with hot lime. Other features included a large hooded fireplace, and a shallow-stepped staircase leading up to a long oak-beamed gallery,Massingham (1966), p. 70. overhanging the central courtyard. The other buildings in the north and west of Munstead Wood have become separate properties. Besides The Hut, these were originally Jekyll's gazebo, potting shed, gardener's cottage and stables. The splitting up and sale as separate properties was performed in 1948 by Jekyll's nephew, Francis Jekyll, who had lived in the house after her death in 1932. He retained The Hut, however, and lived there until his own death in 1965.Tankard and Wood (2015), p. 172. Cenotaph of Sigismunda The Cenotaph of Sigismunda (seen at the end of the path), 1900 A garden seat built by Lutyens for Jekyll at Munstead Wood, consisting of a large block of elm set on stone, was 'christened' the Cenotaph of Sigismunda by their friend Charles Liddell.Massingham (1966), pp. 140–142. He was a librarian at the British Museum,Tankard and Wood (2015), p. 191. and a cousin of Alice Liddell, the girl who inspired Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.Tankard and Wood (2015), p. 52. He was probably referring to the tragic story of King Tancred's daughter Sigismunda, from The Decameron by Giovanni Boccaccio. Jekyll later wrote: Until encountering this name at Munstead Wood, Lutyens had not known the term \\"cenotaph\\", meaning empty tomb. =The Cenotaph, Whitehall= In 1919 the Prime Minister, Lloyd George, asked Lutyens to design a catafalque to serve as a temporary memorial structure in Whitehall, London. Recalling the term he had first heard at Munstead Wood, Lutyens proposed that a cenotaph would be more appropriate. His proposal was accepted, and used for both the 1919 structure and its permanent replacement in 1920, The Cenotaph, which thereafter became the principal war memorial of the United Kingdom. At Munstead Wood, only a copy of the original seat remains.Skelton and Gliddon (2008), p. 47. Lutyens went on to design dozens of other war memorials, including Busbridge War Memorial outside the nearby village church, the commission for which appears to have arisen through his connections with the Jekyll family.

It was formerly designated State Route 29 until mid 2013 when A38 replaced it as part of the statewide alpha numeric shield conversion. The name \\"A38\\" is just the route allocation. In fact it is made up of series of roads which, from west to east, are: * Delhi Road * Millwood Avenue * Fullers Road * Pacific Highway * Boundary Street * Babbage Road * Warringah Road The A38 also has a few notable bridges. They are Fullers Bridge and Roseville Bridge. The Fullers Bridge was built in 1918 while the Roseville Bridge was a newer bridge which replaced an older one in 1966. History State Route 29 was introduced in 1974 along with other state routes. Its alignment was the same as the current alignment of A38. In 1997, when the M2 Hills Motorway opened, the then Metroad 2 along Epping Road was decommissioned. State Route 29 was then extended along Epping Road to terminate at Lane Cove Road (then Metroad 3, now A3). In 2013, A38 replaced State Route 29 and was truncated to the M2. An underpass along Warringah Road was constructed in the Frenchs Forest area as part of the Northern Beaches Hospital Road Connectivity and Network Enhancement Project (Stage 2). The underpass opened to traffic on 28 March 2020. It allows Warringah Road traffic to bypass three sets of traffic lights at Forest Way, Hilmer Street and Wakehurst Parkway.

The club is based in Botafogo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The club's full name is Basquete do Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas, which is abbreviated as Botafogo F.R. Basquete. History The multi-sport Club de Regatas Botafogo (Botafogo Rowing Club), abbreviated as C.R. Botafogo, was founded in 1894. The club's basketball section was founded in 1933, and were finalists of the Rio de Janeiro State Championship, in 1934 and 1937. The multi-sport club Botafogo Football Club, abbreviated as Botafogo F.C., was founded in 1904. Its basketball section won the Rio de Janeiro State Championship in 1939 and 1942. Basketball played a major role in the development of Botafogo F.R.'s multi-sports athletic club. In 1942, a basketball game was played between the two sports clubs of the Botafogo neighborhood, C.R. Botafogo and Botafogo F.C., respectively. During the game, just after halftime, Armando Albano, a player of Botafogo F.C., died on the court, after suffering a heart attack. In his honor, the presidents of each club decided to merge their clubs, and become Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas (Botafogo Football and Rowing), abbreviated as Botafogo F.R. The club also took a new flag and a new crest, mixing both club's originals. After that, Botafogo F.R.'s basketball club won several local Rio de Janeiro State Championships, including the three-peat of 1943, 1944, and 1945. Botafogo F.R. also won the Brazilian Cup (Brazilian Championship) title in 1967, and became the first and only club from Rio to win the top-tier level Brazilian league. Another club from Rio did not do so until 2000. They also competed at the 1968 edition of the FIBA Intercontinental Cup. At the beginning of the 2000s decade, the club's basketball department became amateur, and only became professional again 2015. In the 2017 season, Botafogo F.R. played in the Brazilian Gold League, the second-tier level of Brazilian pro club basketball. The club finished the regular season in first place, and went on to win the league title. They beat Blumenau in the playoffs, and then won the league's finals, after beating AAB Joinville in the 5th and decisive game, at home, by a score of 90–68. The team's main star, Jamaal Smith, was named the league's Finals MVP, after a great performance during the series. In the 2018–19 NBB season, with Léo Figueiró already as head coach, the team reached the semifinals, losing to Flamengo Basketball that would go to win the league's title. Coach Léo Figueiró was named NBB's Coach of the Year. With this campaign, Botafogo finished 4th and secured a place at the Liga Sudamericana de Básquetbol's next season. At the beginning of the 2019–20 season, the team debuted at the Liga Sudamericana de Básquetbol, in a group hosted in San Andres, Colombia, that had the home team Warriors de San Andrés, Nacional de Montevideo and Salta Basket. After finishing 2–1, the team advanced to the semifinals stage. The next stage was played in La Banda, and Botafogo faced, once again, Salta and Nacional, and the home team Ciclista Olímpico. At the first game, Botafogo beat Salta 62–61 with a buzzer-beater shot from Arthur Bernardi. The next day the team beat Nacional by a 10 points margin and, at the final and decisive game, Jamaal Smith put on a show and helped Botafogo come from a 17 point deficit against Ciclista Olímpico to advance to the Finals to face Corinthians. After losing the first game of the finals in Rio, the team counted with amazing performances of Jamaal Smith and Cauê Borges in game 2 and 3 respectively to win back to back games in São Paulo to conquer its first international trophy. The next day, a huge crowd of fans showed up to receive the players and celebrate the title at the club's Ginásio Oscar Zelaya.

He gained national prominence in 1916 when he averted a nationwide railroad strike in exchange for an eight-hour day with time-and-a-half overtime pay. Early years Austin Bruce Garretson was born in Winterset, Iowa on 4 September 1856. His father was Nathan Garretson, a lawyer and a Quaker who firmly believed in the importance of practical skills. After Austin had been educated at the school in Osceola, Iowa his father apprenticed him as a wheelwright. He obtained a job as a brakeman on New Virginia line, later part of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. After four years Garretson became a conductor, and held this post until 1881. He then moved to Denison, Texas, where he found work with the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad. In 1884 Garretson became a member of the Lone Star Division 53 of the Order of Railway Conductors, and became active in union work. In 1885 he was the local's delegate to the 18th national convention of the Order, held in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1887 he was elected grand senior conductor, unpaid, and from then until 1919 held office in the union. In 1888 he moved to San Luis Potosí in Mexico, working for the National Railroad of Mexico, and then to Jimulco where he worked for the Mexican Central Railway. He returned to the United States in 1889. In 1890 Garretson was one of the leaders of the progressive faction that transformed the Order of Railway Conductors from a fraternal and beneficiary association into one that protected its members and negotiated for better pay and conditions. That year Edgar E. Clark was elected Grand Chief Conductor of the Order. Clark would head the union until 1906. In 1894 Austin B. Garretson was elected grand senior conductor of the Order, while C. H. Wilkins was assistant grand chief conductor. Garretson and Wilkins later exchanged positions. Garretson was also president of the union's mutual benefit department. He was a member of the executive committee of the American Railroad Employees and Investors association, and a member of the National Civic Federation. Union leader On 1 September 1906 Austin B. Garretson was elected Grand Chief Conductor of the Order of Railway Conductors, in succession to Clark. His title was changed to president in 1907. Garretson found the job made heavy demands on his time, as locals that were unskilled at negotiation increasingly called on the union executives for assistance. In 1907 the ORC and other railroad unions managed to get Congress to pass laws that limited to sixteen the maximum number of hours a railroader could work in one day. Garretson was appointed a member of the U.S. Commission on Industrial Relations (USCIR) created by the United States Congress on 23 August 1912 to investigate the causes of industrial violence. He was one of three labor leaders nominated by President William Howard Taft, the others being John Brown Lennon, treasurer of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and James O'Connell, head of the Metal Trades department of the AFL. Both of the AFL members were close allies of Samuel Gompers who had been pushed out of their union offices by socialists. When Woodrow Wilson succeeded Taft as President in 1913 he changed many of Taft's appointments, but retained the labor leaders. Wilson selected the mid-western labor lawyer Frank P. Walsh as his choice of chairman. Walsh was confirmed by the Senate on 19 September 1913. Walsh noted that Garretson represented \\"the most conservative labor organization of the country.\\" The USCIR sat through 154 days of public hearings between the fall of 1913 and the spring of 1915. It found huge imbalances in wealth in the nation, with the poorer two thirds of the population owned just 2% of the wealth, while the top 2% owned 60% of the wealth. In November 1915 Walsh announced that he was forming a private Committee on Industrial Relations (CIR) with the goal of bringing together \\"leaders of every school of economic belief, from the so-called most conservative to the so-called wildest radical\\" to sound \\"one harmonious note for justice to labor\\". Garretson was again appointed, as were Lennon and O'Connell, but the new committee included a wider range of progressives and activists. In the late summer of 1916 Garretson played a leading role in negotiations in which railway workers won the right to an eight-hour day and time-and-a-half overtime pay with the passage of the Adamson Act. He was chairman of the committee of the four brotherhoods of engineers, firemen, brakemen and conductors that negotiated for the eight-hour day, handling the talks firmly but tactfully. After the end of World War I, Garretson was a supporter of the Plumb Plan for government ownership of the railroads. This would have given labor considerable say in the way the railroads were operated. Garretson retired in 1919, and gave up his editorship of the Railway Conductor. He was appointed President Emeritus and Advisor to the Order of Railway Conductors until his death. Austin Bruce Garretson died at Cedar Rapids, Iowa on 27 February 1931. Beliefs Garretson was against any restrictions on the right to strike, but believed in avoiding use of that right where possible. He was opposed to militant unionism and violence. He was a Christian, and would often use Biblical quotations to support his case during negotiations. Garretson thought that the public had an interest and a right to be represented on boards of arbitration, but only where there was some danger to the public. In 1913 Garretson said of mediation, References Citations Sources    * * Category:1856 births Category:1931 deaths Category:Presidents of the Order of Railway Conductors Category:People from Winterset, Iowa Category:Trade unionists from Iowa ","title":"Austin B.

It was established in July 1998 and closed in 2014. For much of its existence, it was Perth's number one \\"special night out\\" destination. It won many awards, and was described by The New York Times as \\"... perhaps the town's top table, with a formidable selection of Australian wines ...\\". The restaurant's owner and chef, English-born Neal Jackson, served his apprenticeship at the Savoy Hotel in London, and later worked elsewhere in that city. He emigrated to Australia in 1971, and initially held various positions in restaurants around Western Australia. In 1981, he opened his first restaurant, the Anchor and Hope Inn at Donnybrook, and he was later the proprietor of Louisa's, a Bunbury restaurant \\"... that brought him a legion of fans, many of whom would drive from Perth to eat his dishes ...\\". He opened his eponymous restaurant in Perth in 1998. Signature dishes of Jackson's included rack of Amelia Park lamb with confit lamb belly and shank shepherds pie, and Turkish delight souffle with rose petal ice cream. Jackson's was the restaurant that introduced degustation menus to Western Australia. Prior to the end of August 2013, Jackson's degustation menu, nicknamed \\"The Dego\\", was a major feature of its offerings. Jackson's also had an a la carte menu, which included vegetarian dishes. Additionally, Jackson's was renowned for its wine list; its sommelier, Kjell-Ove Almeland, was named Sommelier of the Year at the Australian Gourmet Traveller Restaurant Awards in 2009. Jackson's was given a two star rating, and the award for Restaurant of the Year, by The West Australian Good Food Guide 2011, and retained its two star rating for 2012, 2013, and 2014. On 26 November 2013, Neal Jackson announced that he would be retiring after a 48-year career. He was expecting to sell Jackson's restaurant some time in the first half of 2014, but also intended to pursue some other opportunities. In commenting on the changes he had observed since arriving in Western Australia 42 years earlier, he said that produce had greatly improved, but that the biggest change had been in the public's awareness of food. After receiving protests from customers about the cessation of the restaurant's degustation menu, he also said that he intended to reintroduce it for the final few months before his retirement. In July 2014, a new restaurant, St. Michael 6003, was opened on the former Jackson's site.

His plays include My Arm, An Oak Tree, ENGLAND and The Author. These take various forms, but all reject theatrical conventions, especially realism, and invite the audience to help create the work. Interviewed in 2007, Crouch said, ‘Theatre in its purest form is a conceptual artform. It doesn’t need sets, costumes and props, but exists inside an audience’s head.’Mark Fisher, ‘Art of the Matter’, Edinburgh List Magazine, August 2007 Stephen Bottoms, Professor of Contemporary Theatre & Performance at the University of Manchester, has written that Crouch's plays 'make up one of the most important bodies of English-language playwriting to have emerged so far in the twenty- first century....I can think of no other contemporary playwright who has asked such a compelling set of questions about theatrical form, narrative content and spectatorial engagement.'Professor Stephen Bottoms, Introduction, Tim Crouch: Plays One, Oberon Books, 2011 Holly Williams, writing in The Independent in June 2014, says, 'Crouch has built a name for himself as one of British drama's great innovators, with plays that have disturbed and challenged the passive theatrical experience.'Holly Williams, https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/adler --gibb-is-this-the-real-life-is-this-just-fantasy-9499901.html ’, The Independent', 8 June 2014 Acting Crouch, originally from Bognor Regis, did a BA in Drama at Bristol University and a postgraduate acting diploma at the Central School of Speech and Drama. While still at Bristol, he co-founded the theatre company, Public Parts, with his wife, the director and writer, Julia Crouch (aka Limer/Collins). They worked on eight devised productions, which were performed in 'all sorts of venues - from caves in Gloucestershire, to prisons, schools, and major national theatres like the Bristol Old Vic, West Yorkshire Playhouse and the Bush in London'. Public Parts shows included an adaptation of Ford Madox Ford's The Good Soldier, and The Marvelous Boy, about the poet Thomas Chatterton. As an actor, Crouch also performed in a number of plays for the Franklin Stage Company, New York, and the National Theatre, London, where he was an Education Associate. My Arm Crouch wrote his first play, My Arm, as a reaction to his increasing frustration with contemporary theatre, in particular 'its adherence to notions of psychological and figurative realism and its apparent neglect of the audience in its processes.'Dorothy Max Prior, 'The Works: A Personal View of Tim Crouch', Total Theatre, Spring 2011. He told The Scotsman, 'I gave myself two years to try to make a piece of work, never having written anything before, and over a course of five days in 2002 I wrote My Arm. I wrote it almost without thinking. Looking back on it, I can see I was writing about all the frustrations I had been experiencing.'Susan Mansfield, ‘Everything is an Experiment. If it Isn't, Why Do It?’, The Scotsman, 6 August 2010. My Arm tells the story of a boy who, out of sheer bloody-mindedness, puts his arm in the air and keeps it there for thirty years. In the process, he becomes a celebrated medical specimen and an icon of the New York art scene. In his introduction to the published play, Crouch wrote, 'The boy's action is more meaningful to others than to himself. His arm becomes the ultimate inanimate object onto which others project their own symbols and meanings.'Tim Crouch, My Arm, Faber and Faber, 2003. This theme of projecting meaning is reflected in the staging. Crouch invites audience members to lend personal possessions, such as keys, jewellery, mobile phones and photos, which are then cast as 'actors', shown on a live video feed. Professor Stephen Bottoms describes the effect of this: 'The lack of physical resemblance between the presented objects and the things they are made to represent creates a sense of humorous incongruity, but also allows the audience to bring in personal associations of their own. I recall, in one performance, being strangely moved by seeing a pencil case and a can of body spray bullying the Action Man doll which always stands in as the young 'Tim'. Precisely by not showing us what the bullies 'really' looked like, or having actors 'emote' their aggression, Crouch allowed me to fill in my own responsive associations with the scene described.' My Arm, co-directed by Crouch, Karl James and Hettie McDonald, opened to universal acclaim at the Traverse Theatre as part of the Edinburgh Festival in 2003. It was later adapted for BBC Radio 3, winning a 2006 Prix Italia for Best Adaptation in the Radio Drama category. Crouch has described My Arm as 'the mothership' of his later plays, which all reference it in some way.Catherine Love, Interview with Tim Crouch, The Stage, 22 June 2014 He told Catherine Love that his 2014 play, Adler and Gibb, was 'a very much bigger and more complex version of My Arm' An Oak Tree The themes of My Arm, of projection and transformation, were developed in Crouch's second play, An Oak Tree. This takes its name from Michael Craig-Martin's 1973 work An Oak Tree in which the artist asks us to suppose that a glass of water has become a tree. Crouch's play shows us an encounter between a stage hypnotist and a grieving father, Andy, whose daughter has been run over and killed by the hypnotist. The father, who believes that he has transformed a tree into his dead daughter, comes to see the hypnotist hoping that he can provide some answers. While the hypnotist is played by Crouch, the father is always played by a different actor, male or female, old or young. This second actor, who knows nothing about the play before going on stage, is guided through the performance by Crouch using spoken instructions and pages of script. The play was co-directed by Crouch's long-time collaborators, Karl James, and Andy Smith, the poet and performance artist known as 'a smith', who Crouch originally asked to play the father. Smith suggested, 'Why don't you get a different actor to play the father each time?'. An Oak Tree opened at the Traverse Theatre, in the 2005 Edinburgh Festival, where it had a sell-out run and won a Herald Angel award. International tours followed, including a three- month run at the Barrow Theatre in New York, where it won a special citation OBIE award. To date, over 300 actors have appeared as the father in the play, including Mike Myers, Christopher Eccleston, Frances McDormand, F Murray Abraham, James Wilby, Laurie Anderson, Toby Jones, Mark Ravenhill, Geoffrey Rush, Tracy-Ann Oberman, David Morrissey, Saskia Reeves, Hugh Bonneville, Peter Gallagher, Juliet Aubrey, Paterson Joseph, Janet McTeer, Alan Cumming, Alanis Morissette, Samuel West, Samuel Barnett and Patrick Marber. In 2005, Crouch described his own experience of performing with a different actor each time: 'Every single father has been as different as every person is different....Maybe some have acted too much and some have not acted at all. At times, they've each done exactly what I thought I didn't want them to do. But, in so doing, they are each and every one a revelation. They have done the play in their own way. It will never be exactly how I want it - and thank God for that.' Lyn Gardner reviewed a performance in which the father was played by Sophie Okonedo: 'Watching her, never for a moment do you forget that she is a woman, and Crouch cannily ensures with his stream of stage directions that you never can forget that she is an actor. Nonetheless, as the evening wears on, neither do you doubt that she is a middle-aged man. She looks the same, but she is different.' In 2015, on the play's tenth anniversary, Crouch revived An Oak Tree for a June–July run at the National Theatre, London, followed by a return to the Traverse Theatre, as part of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. In 2019, The Independent included An Oak Tree in its list of 'The 40 best plays to read before you die.'Paul Taylor and Holly Williams, 'The 40 best plays to read before you die, from Antigone to A Streetcar Named Desire', The Independent, 28 February 2019 ENGLAND In Crouch's next play, ENGLAND, he performed with Hannah Ringham, co-founder of the London Shunt theatre collective. Like My Arm, ENGLAND deals with the world of contemporary art, and was written to be staged in white-walled art galleries. As guides, Crouch and Ringham welcome the audience into the gallery, leading them around the exhibition. In the first half, they share a duologue in which they play a character of undisclosed gender, whose boyfriend is a wealthy art dealer and who is in desperate need of a heart transplant. The play uses ambient sound, designed by Dan Jones, to convey the rhythm of the failing heart. In the second half, the character travels to an unnamed Middle Eastern country to thank the widow of the heart donor with a gift of a valuable painting. The widow, who believes that her husband has been murdered for his heart, is not grateful. Crouch describes the play as 'the story of one thing placed inside another: a heart inside another person's body, a culture inside another country's culture, theatre inside a gallery, a character inside an actor, a play inside its audience'. Lyn Gardner saw it as 'an endlessly thoughtful piece which artfully challenges a globalised world where everything is for sale, and questions the value we put on art and on human life.' In August 2007, the play opened at the Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh, where it won a Total Theatre award, a Fringe First and a Herald Archangel. Since then, ENGLAND has been performed in galleries across the UK and USA and also visited Oslo, Lisbon, Quebec, Madrid, Dublin, Wiesbaden, Melbourne, Singapore, Vancouver, Hong Kong, Budapest and Tehran. The Author Crouch's fourth adult play, The Author, was commissioned by the Royal Court Theatre, London, and first performed there in 2009. In the 1990s, the Court had become known for what the critic Aleks Sierz has named In-yer-face theatre, featuring depictions of extreme violence. This made it the perfect setting for an examination of the effects of creating and watching representations of violence. Crouch explained his intentions in an article: 'The Author is a play about what it is to be a spectator and about our responsibilities as spectators. It explores the connection between what we see and what we do. I feel strongly that we have lost a thread of responsibility for what we choose to look at.' In the play, Crouch plays 'Tim Crouch' an in-yer-face playwright who has written an abusive play, which has a destructive effect on everyone involved in it, from the author to the actors and audience. Crouch removed the stage, placing the audience on two banks of seats facing each other, where they watch each other watching the play. Four actors were placed among the audience, telling the story of the abusive play. The original cast had Vic Llewllyn and Esther Smith as the actors, and Adrian Howells as the audience member. When The Author transferred to the Traverse for the Edinburgh Festival, Adrian Howells' role was taken by Chris Goode. In 2011, the play, with the same cast, was performed in the Kirk Douglas Theatre in Los Angeles. The Author divided critics and audiences, and there were many walk-outs. The play itself invited this reaction, including a staged walk-out early on in the action. Writing in the Guardian in 2011, Crouch described the varied responses audiences gave the play, in Britain and in the USA: 'This is a play during which audience members have read newspapers and novels, built paper aeroplanes, performed Mexican waves, sung happy birthday to one of their own, recited poetry, slow hand-clapped, physically threatened actors, hummed out loud with their fingers in their ears, muttered obscenities, shouted actors down, and thrown copies of the text at the playwright. This is a play where 10% of the audience has been known to leave during a performance – each walkout a mini drama in the unfolding narrative of the event. This is a play where the absence of applause at the end has sometimes felt like a blessing and sometimes like eternal damnation. This is a play during which an audience member once passed out; the actors insisted again and again it was not part of the performance, but everyone in the space assumed it was – including the ushers.' what happens to the hope at the end of the evening In 2013, the London Almeida Theatre commissioned what happens to the hope at the end of the evening, written and performed by Crouch and Andy Smith (a smith) and directed by Karl James. The play tells the story of an uncomfortable Saturday night reunion between two friends who have grown apart. Their opposition is reflected in their contrasting performance styles. While smith sits at a lectern, reading the script, acknowledging the presence of the audience, Crouch attempts to create a realistic play, with a fourth wall, even bringing his own set on stage. Describing the play to Exeunt magazine, Crouch said, 'Andy sits at the side of the stage and introduces himself and ostensibly he tells his own story. And playing opposite that is a fictionalised, identifiable other character, who kind of inhabits the other sort of form, the other sort of world. He's a character who attempts to make sense of the world by being physically present in it rather than sitting at the side of it and watching it – by being physically present in a world that he is working very hard to generate on this stage. The push and the pull is between those two worlds....My character is active – politically active, sexually active, physically active. Andy's character in this play is inactive or reflective.'. Simon Holton reviewed the play for A Younger Theatre: 'One of the central concerns of the piece is absence and presence, the space of the theatre and the simple act of being together in that space — what it means, and what it can do. The message of hope rings out loud and clear without ever being preachy or dogmatic. Wonderful, original, powerful theatre.'. Crouch and smith took the play to Edinburgh, where it ran at the Drill Hall Studio for the Forest Fringe, from 18–24 August 2013. Joyce McMillan reviewed the play in The Scotsman: 'As the friend – in a terrific performance from Crouch – rages and sulks and drinks and becomes increasingly, aggressively nervous of the gang of local kids hanging around outside, it gradually becomes apparent – in this brilliant piece of collaborative writing by two master makers – that the dysfunction is not all on one side. Andy, in his chair, constantly avoids his friend's gaze, preferring to address the audience about the theoretical value of theatre in bringing people together. He has succumbed to what sounds like a suffocating domesticity with his Norwegian wife and little daughter, constantly asking his friend to remove his shoes (we all remove our shoes) and not to smoke in the house. There's something vital about male middle age here, something about north and south, something about the smugness of contentment, and the activist value of honest misery. And something about theatre, too, if only because at the end of 70 minutes, the two are still there, still talking, still in the same space, as they might not have been if Tim and Andy hadn’t decided to make a show about them.' Adler and Gibb Crouch's next play, Adler and Gibb, premiered at the Royal Court Theatre on 19 June 2014. Describing it in a promotional video for the Royal Court, Crouch said, 'The story of this play operates on lots of different levels. There's a roller coaster modern-day story about two young people arriving at a derelict house in the middle of nowhere. Classic Scooby-Doo terrain really. And there's a huge amount of backstory around a couple of conceptual artists from New York in the 80s and 90s. At the end of the century, they leave New York and they take up residence in this house, and then ten years after that these young people arrive. So there are elements of a thriller, I suppose, but there are lots of ideas as well around appropriation and authenticity and legacy, and the drive that we have to own anything and everything and everyone.'New Season at the Royal Court - Jan - Aug 2014, a Youtube Video, 20 November 2013. The play, co-directed again by Crouch, James and Smith, saw their most ambitious formal experiments to date. The acting style changed throughout the play, which began with abstraction, as the actors faced front, saying their lines without gestures, accents or actions. They then moved through more dimensional performances to full realism in the second half. Crouch described this as 'a tide of realism, this play – it begins low tide and it goes full high tide, in story and form.'Holly Williams, 'Adler & Gibb: Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?', The Independent, 24 June 2014 Naturalism was further undercut by the presence of two children on stage, building an earth barrow and introducing absurd props. Crouch explained, 'It's a pricking of that absurd structure that we’ve built around us in terms of representation: kids are just so free from that. The child actor – a child, pretending to be another child – is kind of stupid. There are these things that disturb naturalism, like animals, like children, like guns, like nudity: as soon as Ian McKellen gets his wanger out in King Lear, King Lear stops for a bit.' The play was deliberately challenging to audiences. Beccy Smith recorded one audience reaction in her Total Theatre review: 'I don’t want to have to work this hard', complains one man behind me during the interval, 'I come here to be entertained!'Beccy Smith, 'Tim Crouch: Adler and Gibb', Total Theatre website Michael Billington in The Guardian described it as 'a show that defies storytelling convention: the fact is that, for much of the first half, we don't understand what is going on.'Michael Billington, 'Adler and Gibb', The Guardian, 20 June 2014 He concluded, 'I found myself growing into the piece, while feeling that the playfully experimental form dominated the intriguing content.' Andrzej Lukowski in Time Out wrote, 'The lunatic has been given the keys to the asylum: with his new work ‘Adler & Gibb’, mischievous metatheatrical theatre maker Tim Crouch comes in from the outer edges to stage a first work on the Royal Court's storied main stage. The step up in scale isn’t stumble-free. But at its best, this hilarious, harrowing and maddening interrogation of the value of art explodes with fearless intent and piercing intelligence.'Andrzej Lukowski, 'Adler and Gibb', Time Out, 20 June 2014 The most enthusiastic review came from the independent critic, Matt Trueman, who wrote, 'It’s gripping: a full-throttle, partners-in-crime road movie of sorts, splashed with Tarantino-esque swagger and post-Kerouac cool....Adler and Gibb is enormous....It encompasses a whole load of things – and those things feel absolutely current. Crouch is grappling – really grappling – with what it means to exist now, in 2014, with our virtual reality, surrounded by signs and simulacra, with the past regurgitated as reference and retro. Where is truth in all this? Where does art stop and reality begin? Where is life?'Matt Trueman, 'Review: Adler & Gibb, Royal Court', http://matttrueman.co.uk At the Royal Court, the cast comprised Amelda Brown (Gibb), Brian Ferguson (Sam), Denise Gough (Louise) and Rachel Redford (the Student). A simplified production played at Summerhall during the Edinburgh Festival in 2016, and then went to the Unicorn Theatre London and, in 2017, to the Kirk Douglas Theatre Los Angeles. The cast comprised Gina Moxley (Gibb), Cath Whitefield (Louise), Mark Edel-Hunt (Sam) and Jillian Pullara (the student). Crouch took over the role of Sam for the Los Angeles production. Charles McNulty in the LA Times described the play as'a kind of avant-garde-by-numbers production that leaves out what has distinguished Crouch's work in the past — the bold interrogation of the audience's role in the theatrical event.'Charles McNulty, 'In 'Adler & Gibb,' the business of art — painted with familiar brushstrokes', LA Times, 19 January 2017 Total Immediate Collective Imminent Terrestrial Salvation Crouch's 2019 play, Total Immediate Collective Imminent Terrestrial Salvation, premiered at that year's Edinburgh International Festival followed by a run at the Royal Court. Alex Wood described the play in WhatsOnStage:'We sit, a two row-deep circle, while ornate green hard-backed books containing the script are given out. The show begins, actors appear and the audience is invited to read along and contribute, turning pages in tandem, tackling Tim Crouch's lines and taking on roles as and when required. It's a Bible studies class – the text is revered, poured over (sic). The loosely sketched story, about the final hour of a South American apocalypse- anticipating cult and its leader Miles, is an initial entry point for Crouch's new metatheatrical merrymaking show. It's a neat comparison – watching theatre is, after all, a cult-like experience; a story has to exist with a parish of punters. We watch various members of the audience stand up and join the actors, the plot gradually coming into focus....There are some striking similarities with previous Crouch work – especially An Oak Tree, which also used the loss of a family member to interrogate what it means to perform and the various, eccentric ways that grief can manifest itself. But this piece feels less emotionally intimate and more playfully communal – you can almost sense Crouch's joy at having members of the public entering his space.'Alex Wood, Review: Total Immediate Collective Imminent Terrestrial Salvation, WhatsonStage, 8 August 2019 Plays for Children Alongside his adult theatre, Crouch has written several plays for young audiences. In 2018, he told Theatre Weekly, 'Children are experiencing theatre all the time. In their homes, their playgrounds, their schools. The organisation of narrative and imaginative play is as important to a child's game as it is to a playwright. Children are natural dramatists in their play. They structure and create character. I think It's vital that a child sees their process repeated back to them by the adults – and with the formal validation of the broader culture. To understand that adults also engage in imaginative play and story-telling.'Greg Stewart, 'Interview: Tim Crouch of Beginners', Theatre Weekly, 15 March 2018 Shopping for Shoes Crouch's first children's play was Shopping for Shoes, commissioned in 2003 by The Education Department of the National Theatre. The play is a romantic comedy exploring the power of the logo and how hard it is to resist. Siobhan McCluskey, a politically aware 13-year-old vegetarian, has a crush on fellow pupil, Shaun Holmes, who only cares about his Nike Air Jordans. They are brought together following a chance encounter with some dog dirt and a trip to a bowling alley. Crouch performs the piece using a platform tilted towards the audience, on which he places pairs of shoes representing the characters. 'The shoes are never animated like conventional puppets, but each is given time, space and sometimes sound to assert itself.' So Siobhan's dad, Keith, is represented by 'Terrible sandals and jaunty whistling.' Shopping For Shoes was first performed at St Ursula's School, Greenwich, on 18 June 2003. It then toured schools across the UK, winning the 2007 Arts Council Brian Way Award. Fairy, Monster, Ghost For Brighton Festival, Crouch has written three monologues: I, Caliban (2003), I, Peaseblossom (2004) and I, Banquo (2005), later performed together as the Fairy, Monster, Ghost trilogy. The plays introduce Shakespeare's plays to young audiences by retelling the stories from the viewpoints of minor characters. In I, Caliban, Crouch is the monster from The Tempest, left alone on the island after all the characters have departed, with one last bottle of wine, and still missing his mum. Caliban introduces himself to the audience: 'You're thinking, what an ugly man...Well, YOU'D BE UGLY IF YOU HAD A LIFE LIKE MINE.' In I, Peaseblossom, he is the innocent child fairy from A Midsummer Night's Dream, a character who only gets one line in Shakespeare's play. I, Banquo is a darker play, for teenagers, narrated by the murdered best friend of Macbeth. Crouch appears on stage 'accompanied by a heavy-metal-guitar-playing 13 year old Fleance, a severed head and 32 litres of blood' I, Malvolio Crouch's fourth Shakespeare adaptation, I, Malvolio, was also written for teenagers, a co- commission by Brighton Festival and Singapore Arts Festival, where it was shown in 2010. It went on to have a huge success with adult audiences at the Traverse in the 2011 Edinburgh Festival. Like Crouch's previous play,The Author, I, Malvolio is a play about what it is to be a spectator and about our responsibilities as spectators. In a performance close to standup comedy, Crouch appears as the pompous, theatre-despising, puritan steward from Twelfth Night, following his humiliation at the end of that play. Wearing stained long-johns and crumpled yellow stockings, he berates the audience: 'Look at you. Sitting there with your bellies full of pop and pickled herring. Laughing at me. Go on. Laugh at the funny man. Laugh. Make the funny man cry.' His response to the audience's laughter is a recurring cry of 'You find that kind of thing funny?' Joyce McMillan, reviewing I, Malvolio in the Scotsman, wrote, 'There's never anything less than fully adult about this searing deconstruction of the conflict between Malvolio and – well, who? Not only the other characters, it seems, but us, the audience of relentless good-time boys and girls, laughing at Malvolio's humiliation, mocking the brief hope of love he enjoys.' I, Cinna (The Poet) Tim Crouch at the Unicorn Theatre London, following a performance of I Cinna (The Poet) in February 2020 As part of the 2012 World Shakespeare Festival, the Royal Shakespeare Company commissioned Crouch to write and direct a companion piece to Gregory Doran's production of Julius Caesar. In I, Cinna (The Poet), Jude Owusu played Cinna, the poet killed by the mob after being mistaken for a conspirator in Shakespeare's play. In Crouch's play, Cinna asks his young audience to 'consider the relationship between words and actions, art and politics, self and society. During the performance he asks us to write alongside him: a small poem on a big theme.' In a 2020 revival, directed by Naomi Wirthner at the Unicorn Theatre London, Crouch played Cinna. Interviewed by Catherine Greenwood, he talked about how the play had taken on new meanings since the first run: '2012 was the year after the riots in London so there was a connection to that in the original production. But the riots feel piecemeal, small scale, compared to what's happening globally now. And the idea of a country being led by a dictator who's manipulating language – welcome to the world!...Words at the moment are really complex, slippery, things politically. In 2012, we were infants in that world, and now we're horrified teenagers going, Can words really have that effect? People can lie, using the right words, they lie and everyone just accepts them. And that is also in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar; Mark Antony turns the whole course of history with his use of language.'Catherine Greenwood, Interview with Crouch, I, Cinna (the poet), Teacher Resource Pack, Unicorn Theatre, 2019, p9 In her review in The Stage, Sally Hales wrote that 'Crouch weaves a rich tapestry of meaning that encompasses revolution, republicanism, democracy, the power of the written word, freedom and personal responsibility in a digital age....Lily Arnold’s set is backed by a large swathe of crumpled paper on to which Will Monks’ violent video imagery of riots flash up during startling moments accompanied by Owen Crouch’s soundscape, bursting from near-silence into pulsating, insistent beats. This, along with Crouch’s enthralling storytelling, combines to give the show a relentless sense of urgency.'Sally Hales, 'I, Cinna (The Poet) review at Unicorn Theatre, London – ‘a fascinating feat of storytelling’', The Stage, 14 February 2020 Melinda Haunton, on the View from the Cheap Seat site, wrote, 'It’s a tribute to how successful this show is as creative inspiration that a sticky press night audience of adults and critics scribbled without stopping.'Melinda Haunton, 'I Cinna the Poet Unicorn Theatre;, View from the Cheap Seat, 14 February 2020 Eve Allin, in Exeunt magazine, responded to Crouch's poetic challenge by writing her review of the show 'in sonnets and haikus and couplets.'Eve Allin, Review: I, Cinna (The Poet) at Unicorn Theatre, Exeunt, 13 February 2020 Kasper the Wild As well as writing for youth audiences, Crouch writes plays to be performed by young actors. In 2006, he was commissioned by the Playhouse (a scheme run by Plymouth Theatre Royal, York Theatre Royal and Polka Theatre) to write a play to be performed by primary school children. Kaspar the Wild, inspired by Kaspar Hauser, is a story about the mystery wild boy, found wandering wearing scruffy clothes and trainers, who joins Year Six classmates in a sleepy village school. The play, performed by children in chorus, is written in verse: 'What do we do with a boy so deprived/ Who refuses to learn or to grow or to thrive?/ WHAT DO WE DO?/ We send him to school, that's what we do.' One girl performer, interviewed for the trailer for a 2011 production in Plymouth, said, 'The play is cool because the narrators say things like 'What do you think?' And most plays they tell you what to think. Plus it rhymes, which is really cool.' John, Antonio and Nancy John, Antonio and Nancy is a 2010 play for three young teen actors, commissioned by the Royal Court Theatre as part of Rough Cuts. The play was directed by Maria Aberg and performed by Couch's son, Joey, Ella Campbell and Kieran Mulligan. It premiered at Theatre Local, Elephant & Castle, and also played the Nightingale Theatre, Brighton, as part of Brighton Fringe 2011. The performers, wearing red, blue and yellow ties, play John Brown, Antonio Clegg, and Nancy Cameron, the children of the three party leaders in the 2010 UK election. In the play, Crouch deconstructs the language used in the televised debates by placing quotations from the leaders in the mouths of their children. So Gordon Brown's 'Only last week, I met a widow in Portsmouth' becomes, in the mouth of his son, 'Only last week, my father met a widow in Portsmouth'. The cumulative effect of the statements is comic, 'highlighting the absurdity of ’media friendly’ language'. Beginners In 2018, Crouch wrote Beginners, a play performed by and for children and adults. It 'tells the story of three families trapped in a waterlogged holiday cottage over summer. The children are bored. The adults are down the pub. So far so normal.'Unicorn Theatre website listing for Beginners Crouch told the Evening Standard, 'I wrote it because my children have grown up. I love the adults they’ve become but I miss the children they were. I sometimes think I see the children that they were in the adults they’ve become and that makes me inordinately happy and also inconsolably sad.'Jessie Thompson, Tim Crouch: 'I started writing to stop moaning about the theatre I didn't want to see', Evening Standard, 13 March 2018 The play, directed by Crouch, was first performed at London's Unicorn Theatre in March 2018. The cast comprised five adult actors (Pandora Colin, Rob Das, Jacqui Dubois, Neil D'Souza and Amalia Vitale) playing the children, their parents and a dog. The children were also embodied by four young actors, with roles shared by Atinuke Akinrinade, Ethan Dattani, Nekisha Eric, Rowan Davies-Moore, Archie MacGregor, Ella Scott, Emilija Trajkovic and Milan Verma. Beginners was designed by Chloe Lamford and Camilla Clarke with music by Nick Powell Miriam Gillinson, in Time Out, described the play as 'a properly grown-up piece of children's theatre that reaches across the generations....Crouch likes to tease his audience...test our senses and generally mess with our heads. The real thrill here is that Crouch applies these exact same methods to his family show and pulls it off brilliantly....The stage is gradually given over to the four talented young actors...Their hopes and dreams fill the space...and we realise these are really our hopes and dreams, only fresher and freer.'Miria Gillinson, Beginners review, Time Out, 11 January 2018 Maddy Costa, in Exeunt, described Beginners as 'complex and nuanced, slippery and sly, frequently hilarious, densely poetic, often bewildering to my children, but pleasingly a challenge to their powers of deduction.'Maddy Costa, 'Review: Beginners at the Unicorn Theatre', Exeunt, 3 April 2018 Lyn Gardner, in The Guardian, wrote that the play 'operates like a mischievous yet emotionally textured murder mystery, but one without a body. It investigates instead how childhood gets killed....The pleasure in Crouch's increasingly funny play is in the way that...he gradually enlarges the metaphysical and physical space. Watching it – and the play within the play that the children stage – we expand our belief in what's possible and how we can overcome what life throws at us.'Lyn Gardner, 'Beginners review – the rainy holiday that changed the world', The Guardian, 30 March 2018 However, The Evening Standard critic, Fiona Mountford, 'constantly struggled to work out whether the characters we were watching were adults or children.'Fiona Mountford, 'Beginners Review: Family holiday without the drama', Evening Standard, 5 April 2018 Collaborations As an experimental theatremaker, Crouch enjoys collaborating with other companies and art forms. May is a 2011 collaboration between Crouch and the Probe dance company, performed by the dancers Antonia Gove and Ben Duke with music by Scott Smith. Crouch provided text about May, a beautiful girl who self-harms, and Gregory, her shy boyfriend. Jake Orr reviewed the piece: 'The overall effect is of a tenderness that meets and crashes into chaos. Crouch's dialogue is unhinged by the characters’ inability to express themselves, which then gets explored through dance.' In 2012, Crouch was invited by the Dutch theatre company Kassys to collaborate, along with the Nature Theatre of Oklahoma] and Nicole Beutler in Cadavre Exquis, a project inspired by the Surrealist parlour game, Exquisite Corpse. A Cadavre Exquis is a poem (or a drawing) written by several poets, without knowing what the others have written. 'The first writer writes a line of poetry on a piece of paper. Then he folds the paper in such a way that only the last word is visible. The second writer continues.' The rules set out for the theatre project were that 'Each director makes a part that is maximum 15 minutes. As a starting point each director only sees the last 60 seconds of the previous part. Each director brings in one performer.'. Crouch, who brought Hannah Ringham, from ENGLAND, as his performer, wrote, 'Cadavre Exquis magnifies the process of the here and now. It throws us into the arms of a response, which feels like the most productive way to work. The project also elevates its audience by not being in full control of itself. By quartering the traditional unity of intent, the theatre makers become as associative as the audience.' Don't Forget the Driver In 2019, Crouch collaborated with Toby Jones, writing Don't Forget the Driver, a six-part comedy series for the BBC. Set in Bognor Regis, the series tells 'the story of coach driver and single dad Peter Green (Jones). His is a life of ordinary routine; clip on ties, limp packed lunches, vehicle checks, round-trip coach journeys ferrying church groups to donkey sanctuaries and Japanese tourists to Canterbury Cathedral.''BBC Two announces brand new comedy Don’t Forget The Driver ' BBC Press release, 30.04.18 Crouch described the series as 'a love- song to Bognor. It’s where I come from and it’s a lot of who I am....The series is about a moment when a seemingly small life interacts with the wider world. Bognor sits on the edge of England - facing out towards Europe. I’ve known it since the sixties and it's changed with the times. A migrant population has enriched its culture....The modern world has arrived and yet Bognor still has the unmistakeable air of a seaside town holding onto its traditional values. It’s like two rivers joining - a sometimes mis-remembered past and an unknown future. Bognor has become a good place to explore many of the themes of national identity that are gripping our country.'Joe Stack, 'I feel that Don't Forget The Driver is a love-song to Bognor', Bognor Regis Observer,5 October 2018 Influence Crouch's plays have been translated into many other languages, and there have been productions of them in Italy, France, Portugal, Poland, Czech Republic, Germany, Brazil, Canada, Australia, the US and South Korea. The plays are set texts in schools and drama colleges, and a new generation of 'Crouchian' experimental theatremakers is emerging. Little Bulb and Made in China are two companies who have cited Crouch as an influence. Chris Goode and A Smith, who have both worked with Crouch, and Michael Pinchbeck also explore similar areas of metatheatre. Directing Crouch also works as on occasional director. For the Royal Shakespeare Company, in Stratford, he has directed productions of The Taming of the Shrew, in 2011, King Lear and his own play I, Cinna (the Poet), both in 2012. In February 2016, he directed Gary Owen's play for children, Jeramee, Hartleby and Ooglemore, at the Unicorn Theatre, London. In 2016, Crouch adapted and directed The Complete Deaths by Spymonkey, in which all 75 onstage deaths in Shakespeare's plays were performed. After previews at the Royal & Derngate in Northampton, The Complete Deaths premiered in May at the Theatre Royal Brighton as part of the Brighton Festival. Reviewing the show in The Stage, Natasha Tripney wrote,'The pairing of Spymonkey with director Tim Crouch turns out to be inspired. The show contains moments of physical brilliance but also some equally entertaining repurposing of live art tropes....The best moments are when it manages to feel both like a Spymonkey show and a Tim Crouch production at the same time, a bloody marriage of slapstick and something more probing about the staging of death: the extinguishing of life and light. But it never entirely removes its tongue from its cheek; the production's main aim is to make its audience laugh, which it does, often. We laugh with them at death.'Natasha Tripney, The Complete Deaths review at Theatre Royal, Brighton – ‘brilliantly ridiculous’, The Stage, 12 May 2016 Dramatugy of Liberating Constrictions In an interview to Duška Radosavljević, Tim Crouch has spoken about the significance of 'liberating constrictions' for his creative process: 'If you have a good restriction, it is really easy: I have to make a play that will contain an actor who doesn’t know the play, and suddenly ideas start flooding about devices and models of imparting character.' Unease One of the recurring features of Crouch's work is the creation of uneasy moments for the audience. At one point in My Arm, the narrator, describing his earliest memory of an exercise in will power, says, 'For that moment, we have to go to the great silence of 1973.' Crouch follows this by holding a 'silence far longer than is bearable'. Similarly, at one point in An Oak Tree, Crouch leaves the second actor alone on stage for an uncomfortable length of time. Unease is taken to extremes in The Author, where audience members are given the freedom to walk out. In 2005, Crouch told the Herald Scotland, 'Unease is not an emotion I get often in the theatre and I like it. I'd rather have that visceral response to something than just sit through a piece of theatre that's been made by people who are making theatre.'Carole Woddis,'Go on then, take a bough', Herald Scotland, 10 August 2005.

Plot introduction Using faster-than-light technology, the human race has colonized dozens of star systems. Ubu Roy and his sister Beautiful Maria are down-on-their-luck traders on the edge of human space. In a last-ditch effort to make money to pay their debts and repair their aging spacecraft, they are reduced to searching uncharted space for singularities to capture and sell. In a rare stroke of luck, Ubu and Maria happen upon an alien spacecraft and make humanity's first contact with an alien race. As chance would have it, the alien ship is also in dire economic straits. The alien technology is stronger than humanity's in some areas (such as biotechnology) and weaker in other areas (such as applied physics), providing ample opportunities for trade between the two ships. Both ships become rich in their respective societies by repeated trade with each other. Each thinks they are taking advantage of the other. However, Ubu and Maria's secret is discovered by their trading rivals, resulting in a struggle to determine who will control the lucrative trade with the aliens. Ubu and Maria ultimately succeed through Ubu's better understanding of the alien race's psychology and Maria's genetically-engineered psychic abilities.

She was the first woman to become a newspaper editor in Connecticut, and one of the first in the United States. Biography In December, 1777, before George Washington had become the first President of the United States, and while Jonathan Trumbull was Governor of Connecticut, the newspapers in Boston, Massachusetts that supported the Revolution had been shut down by the British, and in New York City only pro- British Tory papers were being published. The Connecticut Courant, then the oldest and largest newspaper in the Thirteen Colonies with a circulation of 8,000, remained open. In December of that year the owner and publisher, Ebenezer Watson, died of smallpox. His widow, Hannah Bunce Watson, already caring for five children under the age of 7 and with little printing training, took on the additional burden of publishing the Courant. She made the Courant employee George Goodwin a business partner, and used the paper to support the war effort against the British. The paper supplied battle descriptions from the colonies, news and analysis of Colonial and British home events, and criticisms of the British Parliament. Excluding advertising and short local items, the paper carried only nine non-political articles during this period. In January 1778, Tory supporters set fire to the mill that provided paper to the Courant, and Watson and Goodwin announced its imminent closure. The day after the fire, Watson and Goodwin printed a \\"half sheet\\" edition of the paper. Then \\"she and the widow [Sarah] Ledyard, co-owner of the mill, petitioned Connecticut's legislature...for a loan to rebuild the mill.\\" Within a day, the Connecticut General Assembly authorized the establishment of a state lottery to support the rebuilding of the mill, and the Courant maintained publication without interruption. In 1779 Watson married Barzillai Hudson, who took over her share of the printing business, and in 1837 the Connecticut Courant became the daily Hartford Courant, which is today the largest daily newspaper in Connecticut. She was inducted into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame in 1994.  Personal life  Hannah Bunce was the daughter of Aaron and Hannah Bunce. She was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on 28 December 1749. She became the second wife of Ebenezer Watson in 1771. After his death, she married a second time to Barzillai Hudson in 1779. She died 27 September 1807 in Hartford, and is buried there in the Old South Burying Ground. References  Further reading  * Claghorn, Charles Eugene. 1992.

The telenovela, which features actors Resham, Faisal Qureshi, and Noman Ijaz in the lead roles, is directed by Babar Javed and produced by Momina Duraid. It was broadcast in India by Zindagi under the title Tere Ishq Mein, premiering on 13 October 2014. Plot Zainab (Resham) is a beautiful girl who is deeply in love with her cousin Sheraz (Faisal Qureshi) and is also committed to him. But Sheraz witnesses certain events which he misinterprets and hence, believes Zainab to be involved in affairs with other men. Thus, he decides to break the engagement only to be told the truth and pacified and finds a place for himself in the good books of his senior at office. And it is here where Sheraz makes new acquaintances and friends who misguide him by suggesting him to marry a daughter from a wealthy family, in order to ensure luxury, comfort and wealth for himself. And thus, lured by these thoughts Sheraz feels the need to break up his engagement with Zainab. At the same time Sheraz also senses that his senior is thinking of getting him married with her daughter (Sheena) and thus, Sheraz starts devising a plan to get rid of Zainab and also succeeds in creating a bad image of Zainab in the eyes of his parents. Soon later, Sheraz's senior visits his home and proposes him to marry his daughter and Sheraz and his parents readily agree to the proposal, leading his engagement with Zainab to be broken up, which deeply disturbs Zainab. Sheraz also spreads rumours and false stories about Zainab in the neighbourhood and she becomes infamous overnight in her entire locality. And determined, to take revenge, Zainab begins her life afresh. She leaves home and despite opposition from her family begins working as a model and later as an actress under the nom de plume Parizaad. Parizaad becomes widely popular among the masses but still Zainab remains to be viewed negatively by her family and the society. Her father dies and her family disowns her. But later her mother and her elder sister Zohra and younger sister Ayesha go through a deep turmoil. Zohra's husband leaves her along with 3 children. Her mother, who is deprived of food and electricity, decides to forgive Zainab and stay with her. Zainab even saves Zohra's house. Much later, Zainab gets an offer for a film, to be produced by a man named, Karam (Noman Ijaz), due to which she is called to Sydney in Australia for a meeting with him. Excited about the project, which appears promising to Zainab, she leaves soon for Australia. At the same time, on the other hand, Sheraz is living an unhappy life with his wife and he couldn't even break up the marriage as he owes a lot of money to his father- in-law which he would have to repay in case of a divorce. In Australia, Zainab, upon meeting and spending time with Karam, begins to develop feelings of affinity for him and also gets to know that he is a huge fan and adorer of her. She finds him to be one of a kind and loves him more because neither does he take advantage of her nor he is bothered about the rumours regarding Parizaad spread in the entire industry. But as the project gets cancelled Zainab returns to Pakistan. Upon returning to Pakistan, Zainab happens to meet Sheraz once again, after years, and determined to take revenge this time she succeeds in getting him involved in a scandal. Sheraz is put behind the bars and becomes infamous in the society overnight. Upon knowing this Sheraz's wife divorces him and she, along with her father, leaves him to be as he is in the police station. Sheraz pleads many acquaintances to help him but all refuse him and is left with no way out. Following this incident, Zainab retires from modeling and acting and travels to Sydney to meet and to be with Karam. Meanwhile, in Australia, Karam's mother forces him to marry a lady named Zari (Ayesha Khan), who is much younger to him in age. And until the marriage both remain unaware of the fact that none of them had given their full approval to the marriage. And after getting married, when Karam gets to know the truth and also that his wife loves a man named Jamal (Imran Abbas), he allows her to break up the marriage and to be with the man of her love. And when Zainab arrives, Karam is once again single and they begin to spend time with each other and slowly develop a feeling of love for each other. But when Karam meets his mother and confesses to her his wish to marry Zainab, she insults and demeans her, forcing Zainab to leave the house. But in her absence, Karam asserts his will and determination to marry Zainab and also claims that his mother and brother have used him just for amassing wealth to fulfill their needs and to uplift their social status and saying this, Karam leaves tormented in search of Zainab. And while looking for her, Karam finds her belongings at various points on a path that leads to his own house. But by the time Karam reaches home Zainab had already committed suicide by jumping from the balcony.

He wrote a number of books on Rabindranath Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi and on Indian literature. Early life The son of Ramchand B. Kripalani, Krishna was born at Karachi on 29 September 1907. He completed his early education from Karachi and Hyderabad, and graduated from the University of Bombay. He proceeded to London for higher studies. He studied for the Bar at Lincoln’s Inn and London School of Economics for history, economics, political science, law and anthropology. Independence movement and Santiniketan Back in the country, initially at Karachi in 1931, he started practising law in Lahore. However, he was arrested for participating in the freedom movement and that cut short his legal career. At that time, he was interested in learning Bengali. After his release from imprisonment he proceeded to Santiniketan with that objective. Rabindranath Tagore was so impressed with him that he offered him the position of a lecturer in Visva Bharati. Kripalani worked for Visva Bharati from 1933 to 1946. During his stay at Santiniketan, he met Nandita, daughter of Mira Devi, youngest daughter of Rabindranath Tagore and the two decided to marry. Busy life In 1946, on a personal request from J. B. Kripalani and Jawaharlal Nehru, he joined the Indian National Congress as its general secrtary. In subsequent years, he shouldered the responsibility of many other party positions. He was invited to many major international events and delivered erudite lectures on various topics. In 1950, while visiting Japan, he released Rabindranath Tagore: a Biography. Between 1962 and 2011 the book went through 44 editions in 4 languages, and he had authored several books after that. He was honoured with the Padma Bhusan in 1969. He was a nominated member of the Rajya Sabha from 1974 to 1980. The Sahitya Akademi was established in 1954 and Krishna Kripalani was appointed its first secretary and was there till 1971. Thereafter, he served National Book Trust and Indian Institute of Advance Study in Shimla. His wife Nandita died childless in 1967.

The film was released on January 27, 2001, and was later remade into a 2013 film by the same name. It stars Chris Heinrich, who served as director of photography in the remake. Of the film, the directors stated that they chose to eventually remake it because they wanted a \\"fresh start\\", as they had shot the 2001 video immediately after graduating from college. Plot A group of high school football players gets into an argument with their cheerleader girlfriends over the difficulty of their respective sports. The cheerleaders insist that forming a human pyramid is difficult, while the players insist that their boot camp is more strenuous. As a result, the players decide to set up a camping weekend with the idea of putting the girls through football training. This turns out to be a bad idea, as one of the cheerleaders ends up beating one of the footballers in a scrimmage game, who then ends up severely beating her. The girls try to escape, only to fall off a cliff and die. Panicked, the players assume that the girls are either dead or dying, and run off in the hopes that nobody will discover what has happened. Unbeknownst to them, one of the girls has survived and later returns at a high-school reunion to seek revenge. She summons the zombified remains of her dead friends, and one by one, picks off the football players.

He was then imprisoned for some time in the Prison of Anemas, before obtaining an imperial pardon. Some scholars have proposed an identification with Gregory Gabras, but this is disputed. Origin and early life Gregory belonged to the aristocratic family of the Taronitai, a clan of princely Armenian origin from Taron. His parents are unknown, but he was the nephew of the panhypersebastos Michael Taronites, who married Maria Komnene, the sister of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118). Some scholars, beginning with Karl Hopf and including Alexander Vasiliev and Claude Cahen, argued that Gregory Taronites was the same as Gregory Gabras, attested for the last time c. 1091. This was the son of Theodore Gabras, who had governed the theme of Chaldia as a practically independent ruler from c. 1075 until his death in battle against the Turkomans in 1098. However, this identification is problematic; as Basile Skoulatos argues, Anna Komnene, whose Alexiad is the main source on the period and about the two men's lives, would scarcely have confused them, especially as both were her relatives. From a series of letters by Archbishop Theophylact of Ohrid, it appears that Gregory Taronites originally held some civilian office in the Balkans, before being entrusted with a mission to the Pontus ca. 1101–1103. There, according to Theophylact, he triumphed against the Seljuk Turks and the Franks, the latter probably a reference to his role in ransoming Bohemond I of Antioch, who had been a captive of the Turks at Neokaisareia since his defeat in the Battle of Melitene in 1100. After completing his mission with success, Gregory returned to Constantinople, where Alexios I named him doux (military governor) of the theme of Chaldia in the Pontus. Governorship and rebellion in Chaldia On his arrival at Trebizond, the capital of the province, Gregory resolved to rebel against Alexios, and imprisoned his predecessor, Dabatenos, and various notables of the city. Alexios at first tried to convince him to submit peacefully, offering a full pardon, but Gregory replied with poems insulting the emperor, his family and the senior military and civilian leadership. Consequently, in 1105/6 Alexios dispatched an army under Gregory's cousin John Taronites, Michael's son, against him. Gregory marched inland to Koloneia, from where he intended to seek the aid of the Danishmends of Sebasteia, but John sent his Frankish mercenaries ahead and managed to capture Gregory before this effort bore fruit. As his earlier offers had been so rudely rejected, Alexios at first intended to have Gregory blinded—the customary punishment for rebellion—but was dissuaded by John, who pleaded for clemency for his cousin; instead, Gregory's hair and beard were shaved, and he was paraded around the streets of Constantinople before being thrown into the Prison of Anemas. At first, Gregory remained obstinate and continued to hurl abuse on the emperor from his cell, but after the intercession of Gregory's friend Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger, the husband of Anna Komnene, he was persuaded to recant and beseech the emperor's pardon. In the end, he was not only released and pardoned, but accorded even higher honours. B. Skoulatos considers him the same as the namesake protovestiarios who was one of the chief ministers in the early reign of John II Komnenos (r. 1118–1143), but he is usually considered a different person. Character In his letters, Theophylact of Ohrid, with apparent sincerity, lavished praise on Gregory and his military and administrative ability, and hoped for him to restore the Empire's lost glory. On the other hand, Anna Komnene presents a more sober picture of the man: despite his rebellion, she is not hostile towards him, but emphasizes his headstrong character.

For the wider view of the LSWR in general, see London and South Western Railway. The London and Southampton Railway opened its main line progressively from 1838 and a year later changed its name to the London and South Western Railway. It was immediately successful, especially for passenger traffic, and the company quickly extended south-west and west to Gosport, Dorchester and Salisbury. At the same time it energetically and prospectively developed or acquired branch or loop lines in the territory to Windsor, Wokingham, Epsom and Guildford and beyond. The \\"suburban area\\" is taken in this article to include the LSWR lines in what is now Greater London, Surrey and small parts of Berkshire extending to Twickenham, Ascot and Windsor in the north, and Epsom and Leatherhead in the south, as well as suburban development on the main line as far as Weybridge and the Chertsey loop. When the lines were promoted, places served on these lines were recorded such as in the Victoria County History of Surrey in 1910-1912 as rural villages, London suburbs or towns. The first main line The London and Southampton Railway opened its main line between the two named places progressively from 1838, completing the route on 11 May 1840. The London terminal was at Nine Elms. Passenger traffic was extremely buoyant, and racegoers overwhelmed the capacity of the Company's trains in the second week of operation. The Company had been frustrated over early intentions to reach Bristol, and harboured the objective of securing territory west of Southampton, but it did not neglect the potential of local traffic closer to London, and early timetables show two types of passenger train service: throughout from London to Southampton, in many cases omitting station calls nearer to London, but also local trains from London to Weybridge.R A Williams, The London & South Western Railway, Volume 1: The Formative Years, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1968, , Chapter 2 The London terminal at Nine Elms on the River Thames afforded onward travel to central London by river steamer and taxi carriage. The location was never intended as a permanent London passenger terminal; an extension eastwards was contemplated in 1836, and was decided upon in 1844. Nonetheless contemporaries note that with few rival railways in its sector \\"The London passenger found it more convenient than other companies' stations. He might leave it by road and frequently dip his hand for Turnpike tolls, or for 3d choose the steamer Citizen, or the opposing Bridegroom, to reach the capital by river, cursing his choice when the rival vessel arrived and cleared the other queue while his own waited half an hour.\\"Williams, chapter 6 The stations as far as Weybridge were * Nine Elms; * Wandsworth, about half a mile (nearly 1 km) south-west of the present Clapham Junction station, fronting onto Battersea Rise; * Wimbledon; somewhat to the west of Wimbledon Hill Road and of the present station; * Kingston; on the east side of King Charles Road, about half a mile (nearly 1 km) east of the present Surbiton station;Gilks, writing in 1958, puts the first station on the west side of Ewell Road but this seems to be a mistake; he appears to justify this from the location of the (former) Railway Tavern, which was in the angle of Ewell Road and Lamberts Road, and from South Terrace, which he says was \\"probably the approach road for the old station and the circular stone steps which now begin the path from there to the present station contrast strongly with the rest of the path and may well mark the original entrance\\" * Ditton Marsh; renamed Esher & Hampton Court in 1840; now Esher; * Walton; renamed Walton and Hersham in 1849; now Walton-on-Thames; * Weybridge The London and Southampton Railway changed its name to the London and South Western Railway on 4 June 1839.Williams, Volume 1, page 122 =Kingston-upon-Railway= The town of Kingston upon Thames was steadily growing and very commercial before the arrival of the railway.'Kingston upon Thames' A Topographical Dictionary of England. Ed. and Pub. Samuel Lewis (publisher). London: 1848. 680-683. British History Online. 12 January 2015. Once the main line was built, at closest, south of the town, a station was provided in the deep cutting there called 'Kingston' in one of its several former tythings. The existence of the station, and the convenience of travelling to London from it, prompted many streets to be laid out close to the station, and for a time the settlement may have been known as Kingston-upon-Railway. The 1841 Year Book of Facts says > Railway town--Upon the South-western line a new town, called Kingston-upon- > Railway, is fast rising, 800 houses being built or in progress.The Year-Book > of Facts in Science and Art, Tilt and Bogue, London, 1841 The station name later changed from Kingston to Surbiton, and later Ordnance Survey maps name the station after its new-founded parish and former hamlet as Surbiton. The Year-Book may have been poetic or short-lived house builders' patter however writers such as Hamilton-Ellis (1962) and Gillham (2007) imply it was at some point the station name.Gillham, page 7, implying it was the station nameC Hamilton Ellis, The South Western Railway, George Allen & Unwin Ltd, London, second impression, 1962 Early extensions, to 1850 =Richmond= The LSWR suburban area system at the end of 1850Early in the life of the new railway, Richmond was the heart of a lucrative residential area for developers generating significant travel to and from London: 98 omnibuses made the journey each way daily in 1844. Local promoters developed a scheme for a railway from Richmond to join the LSWR at Wandsworth and to extend the LSWR line north-eastward from near Nine Elms to Hungerford and Waterloo Bridges. Responsibility for the eastward extension passed to the LSWR, but the Richmond Railway Act received the Royal Assent on 21 July 1845. Three LSWR directors were on the board of the new company raising its nominal capital of £260,000 ().E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 A few road bridges were built, the viaduct/bridge at Wandsworth over the Wandle (and the Surrey Iron Railway) and a deep cutting through about of Putney but via a flattish route, rural at the time, minimal other bridges, embankments or cuttings. Construction was swift and the line opened on 27 July 1846.Sam Fay, A Royal Road, 1973 reprint of 1882 original, E P Publishing, Wakefield, This line runs due east: through Mortlake, Barnes, Putney and Wandsworth with stations for those parishes, the last close to the present Wandsworth Town station -- about a mile from the LSWR Wandsworth station just within the Battersea boundaries, which was renamed Clapham Common at the same time. The line joined at Falcon Bridge, by today's Falcon Road, and ran alongside it, forming four tracks to Nine Elms.Ordnance Survey Town Plan of London, 1:5280, dated 1850 The Richmond terminus was slightly south, by Drummond Place.Ordnance Survey Town Plan of Richmond, 1:1056, dated 1867 In early years 17 trains each way between Richmond and Nine Elms. The Richmond company sought to sell their line to LSWR and after some prevarication a merger was agreed, with a share exchange valuing Richmond shares at a premium, and with a Richmond director appointed to the LSWR board when a vacancy arose. The merger took effect on 31 December 1846. =Waterloo= The Nine Elms station was never intended to be a permanent London terminal so in 1845 the LSWR obtained powers to extend to a more central site, Waterloo Bridge by that road bridge (changed to today's Waterloo in 1886). A second Act in 1847 authorised the extending of two further tracks, reflecting the separate Richmond Railway's completion in 1846. The Nine Elms to Waterloo Viaduct ran through the residential Battersea and Lambeth ancient parishes and the construction displaced about 700 houses. Starting from an embankment near Nine Elms, this line was to assist with gradients and built on viaduct as was Waterloo station itself. The line, terminus and Vauxhall new stations opened on 11 July 1848. Waterloo Bridge station occupied ten acres, with six tracks serving four platformsRoughly where platforms 9 to 12 are at present. The terminus was a cheap, temporary structure.John C Gillham, The Waterloo & City Railway, The Oakwood Press, Usk, 2001, H P White, London Railway History, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1963 revised 1971, Waterloo was aligned to enable eastward extension and on 26 August 1846 the LSWR obtained an Act permitting an extension to Borough High Street to face the London Bridge station of the South Eastern Railway (SER). This would have given public access to the City of London without building a railway bridge over the Thames. Some land was bought but in the slump following the railway mania the Company reflected on the huge cost of constructing an inner-urban line, and allowed the powers to lapse. =On to Windsor, and a Hounslow loop= Putney (Town) station at street levelThis period in 1846 was the time of the railway mania, when all manner of railway schemes were being promoted with the promise, often unfulfilled, of making subscribers rich. The LSWR was not to be left behind, and now was pressing the Richmond line westwards, but was beset with multiple independent schemes competing for the same territory. These included, an 1846 'Windsor, Slough and Staines Atmospheric Railway' company which would probably have used broad gauge. However it was induced by the 'Richmond and Staines Junction Railway' company to form a joint venture, the Windsor, Staines and South Western Railway company (WS&SWR;), rebuffing the overtures of an atmospheric railway. The new company was friendly to the LSWR and had Joseph Locke as its engineer. The Company obtained a No. 1 Act on 25 June 1847. With capital of £500,000 it built the line from a junction with the Richmond railway slightly east of Richmond station, passing to the north of the original terminus and crossing the Thames, and running through Twickenham and Staines to a terminus at uninhabited 'Black Potts' on the Thames 1,100 yards (1 km) north-west of Datchet, a bridge to Windsor on the opposite bank, not yet authorised. However it did authorise the Company to conclude an agreement with the Commissioners of Woods and Forests to pay £60,000 for improvements to Windsor Great Park; a thinly disguised enabling payment to build on through the Home Park to Windsor's historic centre. The No. 1 Act also authorised the new line from Barnes, crossing the Thames and running through Brentford and Isleworth to Hounslow, and rejoining the above line. The Great Western Railway (GWR) sought its own Windsor railway, for the great prestige of serving Queen Victoria, and had secured approval from the Commissioners over their proposed approach. For a time it appeared that the GWR would succeed and the WS&SWR; company, having paid the £60,000, would be refused. However at last both companies obtained approval to come to Windsor -- on 26 June 1849 the second Act benefitting the WS&SWR; permitted the Windsor and Eton Riverside station, not quite so convenient for Windsor as preferred. Very convenient to Eton, stringent conditions were imposed to prevent scholars at Eton College from immoral or unlawful use. Richmond Railway BridgeRailway mania ended leaving few speculative investors, but the line from Richmond to Datchet was opened to the public on 22 August 1848. The extension to Windsor was delayed when the piers of the Thames bridge at Black Potts settled, and the line was opened belatedly on 1 December 1849, 8 weeks after the GWR had reached its own Windsor station. Even then it was to a cramped temporary station; opening of the lavish permanent station, with Royal waiting room and cavalry entrance, was seventeen months later, on 1 May 1851. Meanwhile, the Hounslow loop had been progressing more slowly, reaching (Smallberry Green), Isleworth east of its successor by 22 August 1849 and completed to the junction on the heath in Feltham parish on 1 February 1850. The WS&SWR; merged by share transfer with the LSWR on 30 June 1850. =Chertsey and Hampton Court= The LSWR obtained an Act on 16 July 1846 authorising a line from Weybridge via Chertsey to a terminus near Staines bridge, on the south side at Egham. However the WS&SWR; No 2 Act (the No 1 Act was described under Windsor, above) foreshortened this Chertsey, Parliament preferring to let the WS&SWR; have scope take territory between Staines and Pirbright with a southerly Chertsey line proposal of its own. The slump following the railway mania killed off this WS&SWR; scheme, but by then the LSWR was opening from Weybridge to Chertsey, on 14 February 1848. Hampton Court station at its openingHampton Court Palace attracted already 178,000 visitors annually, and a branch was proposed, and opened on 1 February 1849. Cobb states that the intermediate station at Thames Ditton was opened in 1851, but Butt says that it opened with the opening of the branch.R V J Butt, The Directory of Railway Stations, Patrick Stephens Limited, Sparkford, 1995, The branch was worked by horse traction at first, a vehicle being detached from main line trains at the junction. By 1855 trains from London travelled conventionally.J Spencer Gilks, Railway Development at Kingston-upon-Thames — 1 in the Railway Magazine, July 1958 Waterloo and eastwards aspirations Having reached Waterloo, the LSWR still harboured a desire to get nearer to the City of London, which was the chief destination of arriving passengers. Improvised Waterloo was added to incrementally in 1854, 1860, 1869, 1875, 1878 and 1885 with no coherent plan. It was the South Eastern Railway who made the first move in 1859, promoting and largely funding a London Bridge and Charing Cross Railway (CCR) company, which obtained an Act. It was to have three tracks; it did not envisage today's Waterloo East, but there was to be a connection to the LSWR Waterloo Bridge station. It was authorised as double track, but was actually built as single. The cost of all alterations at the LSWR station was to be borne by the CCR. The CCR line was opened to traffic on 11 January 1864, but the branch into the LSWR station was \\"opened\\" but no trains ran. The LSWR had opposed the CCR scheme in Parliament (asking unsuccessfully the SER to allow use of or track to London Bridge station) -- SER would soon have its Charing Cross (City of Westminster) second 'London' terminus. The CCR said that they had fulfilled their obligations under the Act by building the connecting line. After much argument, the SER arranged a London Bridge service jointly with the London and North Western Railway (LNWR); it ran from Euston via Willesden and Kensington, to be owned by the LSWR from Kensington via Waterloo; this started running on 1 July 1865. Although London Bridge station was near to the City of London, it was on the south of the river, and by now Cannon Street station on the north bank in the heart of the financial district. The station was about to be opened: the LSWR asked for the trains to be allowed to run to that station. The SER replied requiring either very high charges for the facility, or alternatively running powers to any point on the LSWR within 26 miles (42 km) of London. This would be too costly and further difficult negotiations took place, during which the Euston - Waterloo - London Bridge service was discontinued, apparently late in 1866. On 1 February 1867 a new service started from Willesden via Kensington and Waterloo to Cannon Street. Engine and crew changes took place at Kensington (from LNWR to LSWR) and Waterloo (LSWR to SER). Late in 1867 the SER again gave notice to discontinue the service and the last service train ran over the Waterloo connection on 31 December 1867. A few van shunts, and also the Royal Train, were the only movements over the line after that. The next month the SER was negotiating an amalgamation with the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LC&DR;). The LSWR was invited to join too and did more than refuse. The LSWR successfully opposed the Bill of the three companies. The SER now agreed to build a Waterloo calling point on the Charing Cross line if the LSWR would withdraw its opposition. This was agreed, and \\"Waterloo Junction\\" station opened on 1 January 1869; the amalgamation plans of the other railways foundered meanwhile. Waterloo Junction was renamed Waterloo on 7 July 1935 and Waterloo East arose on 2 May 1977. More branches, 1851 to 1862 =North and South Western Junction= The LSWR suburban system in 1862The proximity of the unconnected railways immediately west of London led to a number of failed schemes, until in 1851 the North and South Western Junction Railway (N&SWJR;) built a line just under 4 miles long from an east-facing junction at Willesden to Kew Junction (later by Kew Bridge station), facing west in the east side of Brentford. The line was to be worked by the LSWR and the London & North Western Railway (LNWR) jointly, but at first the larger companies delayed providing the trains service. Eventually a goods service was started on 15 February 1853, followed by passenger traffic on 1 August 1853: four North London Railway trains daily ran from Hampstead Road (connection from Fenchurch Street) to Kew; the N&SWJR; had its own Kew station just short of the LSWR line—a temporary platform at first.Joe Brown, London Railway Atlas, second edition, 2010, Ian Allan Publishing Ltd, Hersham, Overcoming the reluctance of the LSWR, the N&SWJR; started to run through to Windsor, with three additional trains from Hampstead Road to Windsor from 1 June 1854, a service which ended that October. =Curves at Brentford and Barnes= Responding to pressure for alternative London services to Richmond and its Windsor via Staines and Twickenham line, the LSWR arranged with the N&SWJR; to run a Twickenham - Richmond - Hampstead Road service, reversing at Barnes and again at Brentford ('Kew Junction'); some LSWR coaches continued to Fenchurch Street, London. The service started on 20 May 1858. The two reversals were obviously extremely inconvenient, and the LSWR, warming to the N&SWJR;, obtained powers to build an east curve at the part of Brentford freely named Kew Junction and a west curve at Barnes; they opened on 1 February 1862. Williams points out that the passenger timings hardly improved, the Kew Junction to Richmond times reducing from 19 minutes to 16 minutes. The junction was closest to the LSWR station and it built platforms on the north- east curve for the new northbound train service. The original north-west and east-west Kew Junction was renamed Old Kew Junction.Neither curves are in use today. =Vauxhall station fire= Contemporary engraving of the Vauxhall station fireVauxhall station suffered an immense fire on Sunday 13 April 1856; the fire was observed at 8.15 p.m. to be burning a canvas and paper wall in a passage leading to some offices. A train actually passed through the conflagration and another stopped at the station to set down passengers, before the local traffic manager was able to take charge and divert up trains to the old Nine Elms station. The entire timber station building burnt down. Nonetheless the permanent way was not much damaged and trains ran as usual the following day.The Illustrated London News, 19 April 1856 =Epsom and Leatherhead= In the early years of the 1840s the thoughts of the Company turned to the area towards Epsom and beyond. However both the London and Brighton Railway and the London and Croydon Railway considered the area attractive to them, which might enable a line to Portsmouth. A series of bilateral agreements were concluded undertaking not to encroach on other lines' presumed areas of influence.Nowadays competition law would prohibit such arrangements. At this period Parliament commissioned an external panel of experts, the so-called Railway Kings, to adjudicate preference between competing schemes and to assess practicability and desirability, and this led to the suppression in 1844 of a LSWR proposal to reach Epsom; a further Bill was rejected in 1846. However, in that year the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR;) was formed by the amalgamation of the Croydon and Brighton companies, and in 1847 the LBS&CR; opened the line from its (West) Croydon station to Epsom. The LSWR turned its focus more towards Portsmouth, Guildford and Chichester, which also proved contentious. In 1855-1856 two semi-independent companies were promoted, the Epsom and Leatherhead Railway (E&LR;) and the Wimbledon and Dorking Railway (W&DR;). They obtained Parliamentary authorisation, the E&LR; on 14 July 1856, to run from the LB&SCR; station at Epsom to Leatherhead. The W&DR; obtained authority on 27 July 1856 for a line from near Wimbledon to join the E&LR; a little to the west of the LB&SCR; Epsom station, and also to build from Leatherhead to Dorking. The W&DR; was dependent on the LSWR, but the E&LR; was independent, and looking for a larger company to work it, it found the LSWR unwilling, because of its territorial agreement with the LB&SCR.; The E&LR; directors now approached the LB&SCR; who agreed to work the line, in contravention of the same agreement. However E&LR; shareholder dissatisfaction was evident, not least because the LB&SCR; route to London (London Bridge station via Croydon) was much longer than the route to Waterloo. An Extraordinary General Meeting was called, and the Board was instructed to negotiate further with the LSWR, and this resulted in the LSWR winning control of the E&LR.; They leased and opened the single track line on 1 February 1859 between Epsom (LB&SCR; station) and Leatherhead. The LSWR provided seven trains daily, connecting with the LBSCR trains at Epsom. Soon the LSWR was able to open the leased W&DR; line between Wimbledon and the junction near Epsom, on 4 April 1859, enabling their trains to run to Leatherhead. Wimbledon station was then south- west of Wimbledon Bridge, and the new line ran parallel to the main line from there as far as the present-day Raynes Park station. At first there was no Epsom station on the route, but four days later Parliament authorised the construction of a new station at the junction. It was built so that trains from the LB&SCR; station passed through, platforms only being provided for trains from the Wimbledon line. On 29 July 1859 the LB&SCR; and the LSWR agreed to make the E&LR; joint between them, and to double it when required, and from 8 August 1859 LB&SCR; trains started running over the E&LR.; The joint ownership of the E&LR; was authorised by Parliament, and was approved by shareholders on 30 September 1861.Williams, Chapter 5 When Epsom junction was enlarged and the line doubled, the two centre tracks led served the onward LB&SCR; station, and platforms were restricted here to LSWR trains. This arrangement lasted until 1929.Mitchell & Smith, London Suburban Railways, West Croydon to Epsom, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 1992, =Wokingham= After proposals to extend westward from Staines failed in Parliament the depression following the Railway Mania seemed ever deeper and the LSWR did not progress the schemes further. Local interests were reluctant to see their railway ignored thus the Staines, Wokingham and Woking Junction (informally 'and Reading') Railway company was formedCarter refers to this as the Staines, Wokingham and Reading Railway, as does Bradshaw's Railway Manual for 1867. on 8 July 1853 to make a line from Staines (LSWR) to a junction with the South Eastern Railway's Redhill, Guildford and Reading line at Wokingham. Running powers over the SER line were obtained, and narrow gauge track into Reading station on the Great Western Railway gave the SW&WJR; trains access to Reading. Included were unexercised powers to make a branch to Woking via Chobham.Bradshaw's Railway Manual, 1857, reported that \\"The branch to Woking is not yet commenced, and a bill is being promoted for its abandonment.\\" The proposal is not further described by Carter or Williams. The line opened from Staines to Ascot on 4 June 1856 and from there to Wokingham on 9 July. The Wokingham line was worked by the LSWR and later absorbed by it.Col M H Cobb, The Railways of Great Britain -- A Historical Atlas, Ian Allan Publishing Limited, Shepperton, 2003, Bradshaw's Railway Manual, Shareholder's Guide and Official Directory for 1867, Vol XIX, London and Manchester, 1867 =Wraysbury station moved= Wraysbury station was moved about a quarter mile towards Staines on 1 April 1861. The old site was served only by a footpath; perhaps due to objection by the occupier of Wyrardisbury House. The new station is also often referred to as Wyrardisbury on the Ordnance Survey maps of the period.Ordnance Survey maps, e.g. 1:2,500, 1869 etc. From 1862 to 1869 =Eastward to the City of London= The LSWR suburban system in 1869After the extension to Waterloo Bridge in 1848, the Company had a terminal reasonably close to the commercial areas of London. Yet as business travel increased over the years, its inconvenience to parts of the City of London became increasingly objectionable. However early efforts to get access to Cannon Street had seen short-lived success, where the South Eastern Railway defended its investment. The LSWR had more success with the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LC&DR;). By Acts of 1860 and 1861 the LC&DR; was authorised to build a line from Herne Hill quite near Clapham to Ludgate Hill in the City, crossing the Thames at Blackfriars, and the short way to the LB&SCR; and the West London Extension Railway and the LSWR. Further Acts in 1864 and 1866 ratified changes of plan, but the friendly relations culminated in an Agreement between the LSWR and the LC&DR; dated 5 January 1865.There were signs that the LC&DR; was concerned that it had over-extended itself and that it was glad of the capital injection that the LSWR (and incidentally the Great Northern Railway) provided. Mitchell and Smith say that \\"The LSWR lent the impoverished LC&DR; substantial sums to complete their line\\". An arrangement for sharing ticket income was reached. The LC&DR; had already opened its line from Victoria to Bromley, but it now opened its Ludgate Hill line striking north from Loughborough Junction, and a link to the LSWR at Clapham Junction. From 3 April 1866 LSWR trains ran from Kingston, Richmond and Hounslow, via Clapham Junction, Wandsworth Road and Loughborough Road to Ludgate Hill.R A Williams, The London and South Western Railway, Volume 2: Growth and Consolidation, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1973, Adrian Gray, The London, Chatham & Dover Railway, Meresborough Books, Rainham, 1984, =Kensington and Richmond= Kew River Bridge under construction In the 1860s, numerous new schemes were promoted for railways to reach Richmond, causing LSWR alarm for its primacy in Richmond and both it and the N&SWJR; alarm for their '(north) Kew' Brentford station. After much wrangling, the LSWR obtained an Act on 14 July 1864 for a line from the north end of Kensington through Hammersmith to Richmond. The West London Extension Railway had opened in 1863, connecting to the LSWR at Clapham Junction. The LSWR had subscribed one-sixth of the capital cost of the new line, which was operated as a joint line. In 1863 the east facing spur to West London Junction opened, giving direct access from Waterloo to Kensington. Kensington station had been slightly relocated, considerably expanded, and renamed Kensington (Addison Road). As a minority partner in the WLER, the LSWR's right to run north of Kensington, even for a few hundred yards, was contentious. This Bill had been hastily prepared and further Acts were obtained in 1865, 1866 and 1867 making a number of improvements. The LSWR's new route opened on 1 January 1869; it was from Richmond Junction north of Kensington, turning south through its own Shepherds Bush and Hammersmith (Grove Road) stations, and it then turned west along the alignment that is now the District line from Ravenscourt Park to Turnham Green, then turning south- west through Brentford Road station (now called Gunnersbury), crossing the Thames to Richmond. A short spur was also opened from Acton Jn (later South Acton Jn) on the North and South Western Junction Railway to a junction at Brentford Road, giving the NLR direct access to Richmond. The main line ran to a terminus at Richmond, adjacent to the LSWR through station; this prevented the North London Railway (NLR) from petitioning for running powers to continue westward over the Staines lines, to Windsor, Reading or Woking. The LSWR allocated six of Beattie's 2-4-0WT locomotives to the new service.Mitchell & Smith, West London Line: Clapham Junction to Willesden Junction, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 1996, This access removed the requirement to accept trains from the N&SWJR; via the north-facing 'Kew' and south-facing Barnes curves, the former being mothballed and the latter later removed. A new spur was opened from south of Brentford Road (Gunnersbury) to the Hounslow Loop, referred to as The Chiswick Curve and also a connection was made at Hammersmith with the Hammersmith & City Railway; these probably opened on 1 June 1870. The LSWR now ran trains from Waterloo to Richmond via Kensington (Addison Road) and Hammersmith, and also from Ludgate Hill to Richmond. All of this activity was a strategy to minimise other railways' access to all points south and west of Richmond and if possible that town. The last bid failed: as well as the North London trains from Broad Street in the City of London, Richmond gained (from 1 June 1870) GWR trains arriving from Bishops Bridge Road via the Hammersmith & City Railway. In 1875, the Metropolitan District Railway made a short connection westward from its Hammersmith station to the LSWR at Studland Road Junction in that town enabling its trains to reach Richmond, from 1 June 1877. This straight combination forms today's District line. In 1868 the Midland Railway had made a connection between Cricklewood and the N&SWJR;, and it had been contemplating a purchase of the N&SWJR.; To deflect from southward ambitions, the LSWR built a north-to-east curve (the Acton Curve) from Bollo Lane Junction to Acton Lane Junction, giving access to trains approaching from Willesden or Cricklewood eastwards to Hammersmith and Kensington. Midland coal trains started using this to Kensington (High Street) from 4 March 1878, and also for a time ran passenger trains to Richmond from Moorgate Street via Cricklewood. =Kingston= Kingston station at its opening in 1863The town of Kingston had had its somewhat remote station on the main line from the outset and the LSWR obtained powers to reach the town centre, from the north-west. The line was authorised on 6 August 1860, a single arc from Twickenham, approaching Kingston from the west. There was pressure to terminate the line on the west side of the River Thames, at Hampton Wick. This would have required passengers arriving to pay the halfpenny toll to cross the river bridge on foot to Kingston. The LSWR did not wish to open a Hampton Wick station. However the Lords Committee had inserted a clause requiring them to make and maintain a Hampton Wick station as well. The line opened on 1 July 1863, with stations at Teddington, Hampton Wick and New Kingston. As well as LSWR trains, the North London Railway operated passenger trains to Kingston under a duty on LSWR in an earlier Act.Williams, page 180 =Tooting and Ludgate Hill= In 1855 the Wimbledon and Croydon Railway had opened between those placesCarter says it was originally intended to reach Epsom via Mitcham, and the railway was absorbed by the LB&SCR; in 1858. At Wimbledon the line curved in from the south-east and ran to a separate station north-east of Wimbledon Bridge. The LSWR passenger station was south-west of the bridge, and the W&C; line had a separate spur connecting to the LSWR south-west of the station. In 1864 the Tooting, Merton and Wimbledon (TMW) Railway got its Act for a line from Streatham Junction to Wimbledon, including two routes from Tooting to Wimbledon forming a loop, combined with the Wimbledon and Croydon Railway north-west of Merton.Williams, volume 2, says that the scope was from a junction with the LC&DR; at Camberwell, but this seems to be a mistake.Christopher Awdry, Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Ltd, Sparkford, 1990, By the TMW Extension Railway Act of 5 July 1865, the powers of the original company were taken over by the LSWR and LB&SCR; jointly. The LB&SCR; granted running powers to the LSWR to London and also Crystal Palace, and over the Merton to Wimbledon section of the W&C; line. They also agreed running arrangements for goods traffic to Deptford Wharf. At this time the LC&DR; opened a spur from Herne Hill to Knights Hill (later Tulse Hill); oddly, they seem to have been alarmed that the LB&SCR; granted the running powers to the LSWR to pass through Knights Hill.John Henry Fawcett, A Treatise on the Court of Referees in Parliament, published by Horace Cox, London, 1866 The TMW lines opened to LB&SCR; trains in October 1868 and to LSWR trains on 1 January 1869. The LSWR could now run to Ludgate Hill from Wimbledon via Tooting, Streatham and Herne Hill. On the line from Streatham Junction, the stations were Tooting Junction, in the nook of the junction, followed by Haydons Lane (renamed Haydons Road on 1 October 1889).R V J Butt, The Directory of Railway Stations, Patrick Stephens Limited, Sparkford, 1995, Butt gives 'Haydens', Ordnance Survey maps from before and after opening 'Haydons'.Mitchell & Smith, London Suburban Railways—Lines Around Wimbledon, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 1996, The TMW station at Wimbledon was north-east of Wimbledon Bridge, while the LSWR main line station was south-west of it. The earlier spur from the W&C; line to the LSWR was now unnecessary (as the TMW made its own connections) and was abandoned. On the southern arm of the route from Tooting Junction to Wimbledon, the intermediate Morden station was 'Merton Abbey', followed by a station Lower Merton at the point of convergence with the Wimbledon and Croydon line. At first the platforms were only on the Tooting line. The TMW line was double track, but the W&C; line was single at the time, being doubled between Lower Merton and Wimbledon in 1868. A platform on the Croydon line was provided from 1 November 1870, and the station name was changed to Merton Park on 1 September 1887. =Shepperton= In 1861 promoters raised funds for connecting the Thames Valley towns and villages perhaps from Isleworth and certainly through Richmond, Hampton and Shepperton, ideally being a south-west link from the GWR to the Southampton line. City access would be via the Metropolitan Railway at Richmond. They formed the Metropolitan and Thames Valley Railway (M&TVR;), and planned to make a railway for passengers and goods connecting to the metropolis, as well as to Chertsey for westward connection, and they contemplated mixed gauge. This hugely ambitious scheme needed a friendly sponsor, but the GWR was ungenerous, and the LSWR, desperate to keep the broad gauge rails out of its territory, agreed working arrangements only for a branch from the LSWR Twickenham to Kingston arc to Shepperton. Altering its name to a more realistic Thames Valley Railway (TVR), it obtained an authorising Act on 17 July 1862. Many original supporters were disappointed at the limited scope of the proposal and withdrew, but the line opened as a single line on 1 November 1864, from Thames Valley Junction (now 'Strawberry Hill' or 'Shacklegate'). The line was now effectively a branch of the LSWR and amalgamation was formalised, effective from 1 January 1867. Doubling from the junction to Fulwell was probably completed in the same year, and in stages the whole line was doubled by 9 December 1878.Williams, volume 2, chapter 1 =Chertsey Loop and GWR link= Residents of the market town had long complained about their station, which was a terminus on a branch from Weybridge. On 23 June 1864 powers were included in the LSWR's Act to build a line from Virginia Water to Chertsey connecting end-on with the existing branch, and to re-site the station to the north of Guildford Road level crossing. Virginia Water already on an 'independent' railway worked by the LSWR, led to trains to Reading as well as Staines through a triangle junction there. The line opened on 1 October 1866; it was double track except for the westward spur at Virginia Water.Williams, volume 2 chapter 2 =Leatherhead= The original Leatherhead station on the Epsom & Leatherhead Joint line was described as temporary, and was inconveniently far from the town centre, north-east of Kingston Road. In 1863 the LB&SCR; promoted a Bill to extend to Dorking, with a new station in Leatherhead itself. The LSWR requested that the extension and station should be joint like the E&LR; line, but the LBSCR were unwilling. A compromise was reached in which land would be purchased, sufficient for both companies to have stations alongside one another; the LB&SCR; station was to be aligned towards Dorking, and the LSWR station towards a possible later extension to Guildford. The LSWR part of this arrangement was authorised by Act of 25 July 1864 and the new stations and double track throughout the E&LR;, opened on 4 March 1867. =Kingston to Malden= Kingston-upon-Thames station about 1905The LSWR Kingston branch approached from the north in a wide arc; now in 1865 the company proposed to connect the town to a widened original main line, crossing Richmond Road by a level crossing, and passing under the main line near the present New Malden, running eastwards alongside the main line to Wimbledon. An Act of 16 July 1866 modified the scheme, authorising the high-level, through station at Kingston and crossing Richmond Road by a bridge. The line opened on 1 January 1869 including its Norbiton station and at Malden it burrowed under the main line and ran to Wimbledon on the south side of the line, being joined by the Epsom branch at the present Raynes Park and the Tooting Merton and Wimbledon line immediately west of Wimbledon station. There seems to have been no connections between the double track for the branches and the main line at any point west of Wimbledon itself.Williams, volume 2, page 38From inspection of the 1:2,500 Ordnance Survey plans of the period After 1870 In the decade ending in 1870, considerable infilling of the suburban network had taken place; many communities formerly feeling themselves to be inadequately served, now had their own station. Strategically the LSWR had preserved most of the territory it considered its own. The penetration of the Metropolitan Railway and the Metropolitan District Railway in the area around Hammersmith was a borne financial blow. The Richmond and Hammersmith competitors until 1898 could exploit weak Waterloo-City connections, but this had been mitigated by accords with the LB&SCR; and LC&DR; giving access to Ludgate Hill. Laying new lines further afield, the LSWR moved at closer range to improving its diverse network. There remained one major challenge. =Putney to Wimbledon= As residential travel continued to increase, new and existing railways considered whether new territory, or a share of the business at places already served, could be exploited. At the same time, residents of increasingly 'commuter towns', particularly Kingston upon Thames, made great play of their poor City connections compared to rival towns like Richmond. The District Railway had opened as far as Fulham (Walham Green) in 1880 and was contemplating an extension from there to Guildford, striking through LSWR territory and serving many suburban towns that the LSWR considered its own, including Kingston. The LSWR managed to form an alliance with the District, under which a Kingston and London Railway would be constructed, from Surbiton via Kingston and Richmond to Putney, crossing the Thames and joining the District. Mutual running powers were to be agreed, giving the LSWR access to South Kensington and High Street Kensington. Successive unexecuted plans saw authorising Acts such as on 22 August 1881: the K&LR;'s authorising Act permitted building from the District Railway at Putney Bridge, across the river and over Putney Heath and Wimbledon Common to the south side of the LSWR at Surbiton; the District Railway and the LSWR were authorised to acquire the K&LR; jointly. In the same session the LSWR obtained powers to build a West End terminus adjacent to the District's South Kensington station. Also in that session, the Wimbledon and West Metropolitan Railway was authorised on 18 August 1882, to build a branch from the K&LR; line at East Putney to join the TMW line at Haydons Road, getting access to Wimbledon station from there. The District Railway secured running powers over this line. The District Railway did not have the money to fund its share of the K&LR; construction, and after much wrangling, the LSWR agreed to take over the construction only of the section of the K&LR; from Putney Bridge (District Railway) to East Putney, and a modified version of the W&WMR; from there to Wimbledon station (instead of Haydons Road). There was also to be a flying junction at East Putney to the Richmond line towards Wandsworth. Keeping the invader away from Kingston was a great victory for the LSWR but they had to build the Thames river bridge at Putney themselves. They charged the District Railway for use of the bridge and chose to abandon all plans for using the line themselves and for an independent South Kensington terminus.. On 3 June 1889 District Railway trains started operation, using a separate two-platform station on the north side of the LSWR station at Wimbledon. On 1 July 1889 the spurs to the Wandsworth line at East Putney were opened, and the LSWR started operating passenger trains from Waterloo to Wimbledon, running to the LSWR main station there.Alan A Jackson, London's Local Railways, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1978, =Windsor to Woking= The LSWR had leased the Staines, Wokingham and Woking Junction line from the outset, but found relations with the owning company difficult. At the same time Ascot was growing in importance, and a southward branch from there to Aldershot was being planned. By Act of 4 July 1878, the LSWR purchased the company. The LSWR obtained authorisation on 20 August 1883 to build a mprth-west curve at Staines, allowing through running from Windsor to Virginia Water and beyond either west or south. This opened on 1 July 1884, and at the same time a new station, Staines High Street, was opened, as trains using the new curve would by-pass the existing Staines station. The same Act authorised a west curve at Byfleet, enabling direct running from Chertsey towards Woking, and this opened on 10 August 1885, although it appears not to have had a regular train service until 4 July 1887. =Main line widenings= For some years after the opening of the main line, little attention could be given to developing the new network and extensions and additions were made incrementally, with little attempt at proper integration. The ramshackle state of the Waterloo terminal was testimony to this, but the growth of traffic poses major challenges in operating the main line . Nine Elms was the chief goods terminal for London with extensive sidings and yards. Locomotive workshops were here on the south side, part of which was absorbed in the mid-1870s by a new main line viaduct between the Wandsworth Road tunnel and New Road (now Thessaly Road). The four track main line was diverted progressively, tracks opening between 22 October 1877 and 21 July 1878. Widening followed westward (Queens Road (Battersea) to 'Clapham Junction') on 1 November 1877. Since the opening of the Epsom line there had been four tracks between Wimbledon and the present-day Raynes Park. This extended to the next stop when the Kingston line opened; arranged as two double track parallel railways. Here both tracks for the Kingston loop-with- branch went under the main line to progress north-westwards. Here a double- line junction (at the west end of Coombe & Malden station (i.e. New Malden)) was passed by the Board of Trade on 24 April 1880, enabling the four tracks to act roughly as a four-track line. Quadrupling throughout between Clapham Junction and Hampton Court Junction was progressively completed by 1 April 1884, with the tracks paired by direction (Up Local, Up Through, Down Through, Down Local.It is not certain that this naming convention was applied at this date) A new spur was provided at Malden for the loop-with-branch and a new tunnel at Raynes Park brought the Up Epsom line under the main line to join the Up Local Line, burrowing junctions. Accordingly, a new combined and extended Wimbledon station north-east of Wimbledon Bridge was opened, on 21 November 1881, and terminus for the Metropolitan District Railway's trains. By 1890 to Hampton Court Junction was four-track and three-track (only one down) to Woking. =A New Line to Guildford= Residents of Cobham had long called for a railway, and a number of schemes were put forward, and failed. After a complex of schemes, Acts in 1881, 1882 and 1883 authorised what became the Guildford New Line, running from the main line at Long Ditton via Cobham, with a branch from the Leatherhead terminus joining it at Effingham, without a junction station until 1885. Although the line was planned to serve local stations only, it gradually received through Portsmouth trains in the final years of the nineteenth century. =Twickenham junctions= The Shepperton branch had been served from the north at Thames Valley Junction, so that direct running from Kingston was not possible. This was rectified when the south curve from Shacklegate Junction to Fulwell was opened on 1 July 1894,Williams volume 2, page 43 Advertised passenger operation did not start until 1 June 1901.Faulkner & Williams, page 41 A Twickenham flyover, leading the up line from Shepperton and Kingston over the Ascot line was opened on 22 October 1883. This was the first grade-separated junction on the LSWR. =Tooting lines= Tooting station was moved east of London Road on 12 August 1894. Waterloo & City Railway An early engraving of a Waterloo and City Railway trainAfter a couple of fanciful independent proposals, the Waterloo & City Railway company was promoted, obtaining its enabling Act in 1893. Independent, but supported by the LSWR as a tube railway, that is, constructed by boring and using cast iron segments to line the tunnel. Using compressed air and the Greathead tunnelling shield, the line was constructed in twin tubes, passing under the River Thames and terminating at the Mansion House, in a common station provided by the Central London Railway. The station was also used by the City and South London Railway. The line used electric traction at 500 V DC. with a central live rail, and had only two stations: Waterloo, and City (later renamed Bank). It opened to the public on 8 August 1898. Through tickets and season tickets from LSWR surface stations were (as they are) available. The LSWR operated it, and later absorbed it. The twentieth century If the closing years of the nineteenth century had seen a relaxation of the battle to secure territory and fend off competing lines, two new threats now arose: electric passenger trains and street tramways. As well as the developments that were actually implemented (see below) the Metropolitan Railway and the Central London Railway both developed schemes in the years running up to 1914 for extensions of traffic, or new routes, into LSWR territory. Loss of traffic to street tramways was increasingly felt at the turn of the century, due to their convenience, frequency and cheap fares. Lost traffic was to the District and LNW Railway's Richmond services leading to a loss-making operation on the indirect metropolitan LSWR routes, especially the Richmond service via Kensington and Hammersmith, and the Ludgate Hill service via Streatham was undercut. =Tube lines= The City and South London Railway (opened 1890) was the first deep-level tube railway in the worldChristian Wolmar, The Subterranean Railway: How the London Underground Was Built and How It Changed the City Forever, Atlantic Books, 2004, . closely followed by the Central London Railway and the Waterloo and City Railway. A minor tube railway mania followed, threatening LSWR territory, proving complimentary rather than competing: the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway provided better access from Waterloo to the 'West End'. However they demonstrated that electric haulage was superior to steam haulage in enabling a clean air environment at stations and in the trains, as well as technical benefits of increased acceleration and cheaper running. =District Railway= At the outset of the twentieth century, the Metropolitan District Railway (MDR) was planning to run electric trains to Wimbledon from Putney Bridge, extending its existing service. With LSWR co-operation the four-rail electrification was installed and District electric trains reached there on 27 August 1905. The line voltage was 600 V DC. This led to a proposal for the MDR to extend from Wimbledon to Sutton, and to quadruple the Putney to Wimbledon section which was already suffering from congestion. The idea was eventually dropped, but intermediate block posts were provided between Putney and Wimbledon to reduce section time and increase capacity. The MDR finally began to run on the LSWR line between Studland Road Junction (Hammersmith) and Turnham Green. This too was electrified, with the MDR Ealing service running as electric trains from 1 July 1905, and the Richmond service on 1 August 1905. The considerably enhanced and frequent train service operated by the MDR led them to propose quadrupling the track on this section. This was agreed and it opened for operation on 3 December 1911, with a burrowing junction at Turnham Green for Up District trains; the gradient was steep for goods, at 1:50 so a flat junction was provided, eastward, for Midland Railway coal trains.Faulkner & Williams, The LSWR in the Twentieth Century, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1988, =LNWR electric trains= From 1911 the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) proposed electrifying its North London Railway, which it managed. It came to an arrangement with the LSWR whereby the latter's part of the routes to Richmond and Kew Bridge would be electrified for the LNWR trains (where they were not already electrified for the District Railway trains). The LNWR electric service started on 1 October 1916. =Closure of the Studland Road, Tooting and Staines West curve services= Declining traffic on the passenger trains via Kensington and Richmond via Studland Road Junction, and wartime stringency, led to their ending on 5 June 1916; they had already been cut back to start from Clapham Junction instead of Waterloo. The LSWR track (Hammersmith to Turnham Green) was transferred to the Underground group for the extension of the Piccadilly line in 1932.Faulkner & Williams, page 40 The Wimbledon - Tooting - Herne Hill - Ludgate Hill service was discontinued from 1 January 1917, and the LB&SCR; local trains from Wimbledon to Streatham were also curtailed, leaving that route section with no passenger service. The LSWR was restored on 27 August 1923 (under LSWR's amalgamated successor). The Windsor to Woking service was withdrawn on 31 January 1916 so Staines High Street station, on the mothballed Staines West Curve, was demolished. =Hampton Court Junction= In the late 1880s, Hampton Court was a flat junction serving main lines (see widening, as well as the Hampton Court branch and the Guildford New Line via Cobham. Powers were taken (20 July 1906) to provide a grade-separated junction: the Up Cobham line was brought under the main line and opened on 21 October 1908 and the more expensive flyover for the Hampton Court branch, ascending on viaduct from Surbiton station opened 4 July 1915. Electrification of the LSWR network Map of LSWR electrified routes in 1922The LSWR had been slower than competing lines to plan electrification,Discounting the electric Waterloo & City Railway and it was the LB&SCR; among the railways south of London that electrified some of its suburban lines, with the first opening on 1 December 1909. Street tramways and competing, electric railways, coupled with demographic factors, led to losses of income year on year which were becoming serious, such that London area fares were reduced from 1 January 1914 to try to stem the loss. The passive conservatism of the LSWR ended when Herbert Ashcombe Walker was appointed to the post of General Manager from 1 January 1912. Realising that electrification was essential to success, he promoted Herbert Jones to the post of the company's Electrical Engineer. He sent Jones to New York to look particularly at DC third-rail installations in use on urban railroads there.The LB&SCR; system used a higher voltage and overhead line current collection; this required considerable expenditure on structures to support the overhead equipment.David Brown, Southern Electric, volume 1, Capital Transport, St Leonards, 2009, Jones and Walker reported to the Board on 6 December 1912, and the Board approved the largest electrification scheme thus far authorised by any railway. The routes to be converted to electric operation were all suburban or \\"outer suburban\\" and would be dealt with in two stages: the first stage would cover: * Waterloo - Hounslow Loop - Waterloo (done 12 March 1916) * Waterloo - Kingston Loop - Waterloo * The Shepperton branch (done 30 January 1916) * Point Pleasant Junction (on the Clapham Junction to Barnes line) - East Putney - Wimbledon (done 25 October 1915) * The main line to Hampton Court Junction and the branch to Hampton Court (done 18 June 1916) * New Guildford Line to Claygate.(done 20 November 1916)J Spencer Gilks, Railway Development at Kingston-upon-Thames — 2, in the Railway Magazine, August 1958 The last short investment allowed train reversal and interchange, clear of the busy main line. The LSWR proceeded without a new Act, on the basis that the incorporating London & Southampton Railway Act did not limit the choice of traction mode. The Company opted to build its own power generating station, at Durnsford Road, a little east of Wimbledon, and five 5,000 kW turbo-generators were installed, generating three-phase electricity at 11 kV 25 Hz. This was distributed by lineside cables to sub- stations at Waterloo, Clapham Junction, Raynes Park, Kingston, Twickenham, Barnes, Isleworth, Sunbury and Hampton Court Junction which transformed the 11 kV to 600 V and converted it to DC using rotary converters needing constant manning while trains were running. On the track, a third rail of high conductivity steel was laid outside the four-foot; the return current travelled through the running rails; impedance bonds were provided at track circuit joints, and the track circuits had to be altered to AC operation. The line voltage was 600 V positive DC nominal; where the North London Railway and District Railway trains ran over LSWR tracks they used a four rail system, with the outer rail at +300 V and the centre return rail at -300 V; this had to be altered to conform to the LSWR standard, and some alterations were required to the trains of the penetrating companies. As part of the work, the route between Vauxhall and Nine Elms was widened to eight tracks, and the flyover at Hampton Court Junction was now constructed. The rolling stock consisted of 84 three-car units, all the coaches being converted from steam stock. =Electric operation advantages= The trains operated on a regular interval timetable, at first the same frequency through the peak hours, with the train formations being strengthened at those times. The new electric service was a considerable success, and there was some overcrowding. The Guildford new line was served by push-and-pull trains connecting with the electric trains at Claygate, but to release electric stock to strengthen trains in the core electric area, the Claygate service was discontinued (and reverted to steam operation). This was done in July 1919, and the Claygate line did not receive regular electric trains until the entire Guildford New Line was electrified in 1925. From 1919, additional capacity was created by converting further steam stock to two-car trailer units, to operate between two ordinary three-car units, forming an eight-car train. It had been found that the three-car units had power to spare. The trailer units had no driving compartment. World War I and following British industrial shortage prevented progress: the second stage of electrification, covering the outermost suburban lines; and a grade-separated junction at Woking, but this was deferred (and never built). There was no further LSWR electrification before the Grouping of the railways under the Railways Act 1921 by which the Southern Railway was created from the LSWR, the LB&SCR;, the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SE&CR;), and some minor lines; this took effect 1 July 1923.Planned for 1 January 1923, legal difficulties delayed the formal implementation until July. The Grouping was known about well before its implementation—for a time, nationalisation had seemed a possibility—but this did not quell electrical and operational bigotry. The LB&SCR; were anxious that their 6.7 kV overhead system should be adopted as the standard, and at this time the SE&CR; had been planning electrification of its system on a 3 kV overhead system. =Rolling stock: electric units= The original 84 cars ran as \\"bogie-block\\" sets, semi- permanently coupled, built at Eastleigh between 1902 and 1912. They were wooden bodies with semi-elliptical roofs. The conversion was carried out at Eastleigh works, and the electrical equipment where much of the body and running gear conversion was carried out by the British Westinghouse Electrical and Manufacturing Company. The formation was two motor coaches with a driving compartment and \\"brake\\" compartment at the outer ends, with a trailer between them. The outer bogie at each end of the unit was a motor bogie fitted with two axle-hungThe term was not yet in general use (the electric motors were supported on brackets fixed to the driving axle rather than on the (sprung) bogie frame.) traction motors rated at 275 hp (205 kW). A bus lineA continuous electric connection that serves multiple sources and machines ran along the roof of the unit connecting all the current collector shoes, and if two units were coupled, connected the entire train. The master controller had four positions: switching, full series, parallel, and full parallel. Control equipment shunted out starting resistances automatically as speed increased and current drawn fell. In practice drivers could move the controller to full parallel immediately on starting, and the control equipment would lower resistance without intervention. The notching process produced a series of sharp clicks, and the units were nicknamed \\"nutcrackers\\" from this cause. The specified maximum running speed was , although a maximum speed in service of was imposed due to rough riding at higher speeds. The Westinghouse quick- acting brake was installed in place of the automatic vacuum brake as it allowed faster stops and restarting, important for a high-frequency urban railway. Within the unit the couplings were semi-permanently fixed with a bar coupling, but conventional couplings were provided at unit ends; in addition were the power jumper for the bus line and an eight-core control cable, as well as the Westinghouse brake pipe coupling. For reasons of style, the units were given a blunt torpedo shaped end with a domed roof at the ends; a new livery was provided, of sage green, with black and yellow lining and mid-brown window mouldings, and the roof was coloured off-white. The width over body was 8 ft 0¾ in (2.46 m), and 8 ft 10¾ in (2.71 m) over handles. An external opal panel was provided at each end of the unit between the motorman's windows, for a stencil plate, a letter indicating the route (which was illuminated at night). The units only provided first and third class accommodation all in compartments. =Trailer units= The success of the new electric service was such that severe overcrowding took place at busy periods, and in 1919 the LSWR decided to build some two-car trailer units. The electric units had plenty of power and steam coaching vehicles were cheaply converted, so that eight-car trains could be formed by inserting one trailer between two three-car electric units. To shunt such trailer units off at the end of the busy periods was a difficult procedure therefore, but they were a cheap and quick expedient to relieve the overcrowding. 24 of these units were built in the period January 1920 to December 1922. Southern Railway The LSWR suburban network was working profitably and the Southern Railway continued and later extended the electrified system. The LSWR configuration of third rail operation at 600 V DC. (later gradually increased to 750 V) became the standard for the whole electrified network of the Southern Railway and later (after 1948) of the British Railways system in the southern counties, eventually reaching the coast at Ramsgate, Brighton, and Weymouth. =Wimbledon architectural improvement= Wimbledon station was completely reconstructed, seamless to its street like Richmond, 1927-8, combining the joint LB&SCR; section and the District Railway sections, retaining identifiably distinct platforming arrangements. =Durnsford Road flyover= When the main line was quadrupled in the early years of the twentieth century, the tracks allocated to stopping trains were on the outside with the main lines in the centre: \\"pairing by direction\\". This makes the main lines safe everywhere except at one point: that local trains must cross both main lines (before or after a terminus) to account for their change in direction. This made sufficient gaps relatively short, even given advanced signalling. To cure delays a flyover was built east of Wimbledon, carrying the north outer line across the two central lines, so that from there to Waterloo up and down slow lines were on the south side \\"paired by use\\". The new layout was brought into use on 17 May 1936. Chessington line From 1923 considerable housing development took place in the area that came to be served by the Chessington branch, built by the successor. It was originally planned to extend to Leatherhead, joining the existing route there. It left the Dorking line at Motspur Park and it was opened on 29 May 1938 to Tolworth, with an intermediate station at Malden Manor. The following year, on 28 May 1939, it was extended to Chessington North and Chessington South, its stations being built of Art Deco sculpted concrete, typical of the Southern Railway's design investment in the period, epitomised by Surbiton (which has a protected status). Plans to extend were thwarted by the Second World War.Mitchell & Smith, Wimbledon to Epsom, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 1995, Notes References Category:Railway lines in London Category:History of rail transport in London ","title":"LSWR suburban lines"},{"id":"40188530","text":"Phú Hội is a rural commune () of Nhơn Trạch District, Đồng Nai Province, Vietnam.Ministry of Public Information in Vietnam References Category:Populated places in Đồng Nai Province Category:Communes of Đồng Nai Province Category:District capitals in Vietnam ","title":"Phú Hội, Đồng Nai"},{"id":"40188534","text":"(David) Eifion Evans (22 January 1911 – 23 May 1997) was Archdeacon of Cardigan from 1967Archdeacon Of Cardigan The Times (London, England), Wednesday, Jul 26, 1967; pg. 10; Issue 57003 to 1979.

History The Duquesne Brewery clock in 2019, with no advertising on the faceThe clock face, with a minute hand and a hour hand, both of laminated aluminum, is nearly twice the size of London's Big Ben, and was built in Georgia by Audichron for $12,500 and shipped to Pittsburgh. The clock, designed by Audichron founder John L. Franklin, is driven by a Janett motor. Originally located on a Mount Washington hillside, the clock's face was used as advertising for a succession of beverages, including Coca-Cola, and Fort Pitt, Ballantine, Carling, and Schlitz beers. In 1961, the Duquesne Brewing Company bought the clock, painted its \\"Have A Duke\\" slogan on the face and installed it atop its building in the South Side where it has been running since. After the brewery closed in 1972, the clock was leased to Stroh's Beer, then WTAE-TV Channel 4. After WTAE's lease ended in 1993, the clock continued to run without an ad.

It is a remake of their 2001 film of the same name that was also written and directed by McKee and Sivertson, and stars Caitlin Stasey as a cheerleader who must fight against the supernatural. The film had its world premiere on September 5, 2013, at the Toronto International Film Festival and had a limited theatrical release in June 2014. Plot The film opens with Mäddy Killian (Caitlin Stasey) recording footage of her childhood friend Alexis (Felisha Cooper) as she prepares for the final days of school before summer break and for cheerleading practice. She discusses how important it is to remain fit and how dangerous cheerleading can be, pointing out how easy it is for some of the more advanced cheerleader moves to end with severe or deadly injuries. This proves to be the case when Alexis is thrown into the air and her teammates fail to catch her in time, resulting in her death. Once school resumes Mäddy decides that she will try out for the cheerleading team and manages to impress the entire team with her acrobatic skills. After being accepted, Mäddy notes that Tracy (Brooke Butler) has begun dating Terry (Tom Williamson), a star football player who had been dating Alexis prior to her death. She begins to get along with the other cheerleaders, the overly religious and prissy Martha (Reanin Johannink) and her shy sister Hanna (Amanda Grace Cooper), who serves as the cheerleading mascot. This provokes Mäddy's ex-girlfriend Leena (Sianoa Smit-McPhee), who can't understand why Mäddy would want to hang out with the cheerleaders. Unbeknownst to everyone else, Mäddy has actually joined the cheerleading squad to take revenge on Terry for as yet unspecified reasons. Mäddy begins taking her revenge by convincing Tracy that Terry had cheated on her during the summer and even manages to successfully seduce her at a group gathering of cheerleaders and football players. This greatly hurts Leena (who had been watching the gathering from afar) and angers Terry, who starts a fight, and bans the \\"dogs\\" (football players) from dating the \\"bitches\\" (cheerleaders). He then punches Tracy in a fit of anger. The cheerleaders all try to escape the raging football players, only for Terry to cause an accident that claims the lives of all of the cheerleaders. Horrified at what she's seen, Leena manages to revive all of the dead cheerleaders using Wicca magic and magic stones. The following day the girls are all disoriented and scared, especially Martha and Hanna, as they have also somehow swapped bodies. None of them recollect exactly what happened until Leena reveals to them what occurred the night before. They're also very hungry, which prompts them to attack one of Leena's neighbors and suck out all of his blood. The girls then go to school, where the football players all watch them with disbelief, as they'd thought them all dead. During the day the cheerleaders pick off the football players one by one, either out of hunger or, in the case of Martha, out of anger when she realizes that her sister slept with her boyfriend, Manny (Leigh Parker), using her body. While the girls were all initially willing to work together, their solidarity unravels due to the day's deaths and the discovery from Mäddy's video diaries that she had joined the squad out of revenge. She tries to explain her cruel criticism of them, but none of the others will listen to her, especially not Tracy, as she had genuinely begun to fall in love with Mäddy. The only person who will listen is Leena and Mäddy tells her that she had been raped by Terry while attempting to film a memorial video for Alexis and that up until that point, she had not wanted revenge. The girls are then picked off one by one by Terry, who has figured out what is going on and manages to defeat them by cutting out the magic stones (which reside in the girls' bodies) and swallowing them. Terry manages to corner Mäddy and Leena in a graveyard where he tries to force Leena to show him how to use her magic for his benefit, only for him to die after Mäddy attacks him and Leena's magic somehow manages to force the stones out of him. Mäddy dies again as a result of this but Leena manages to revive her through her own grief, the same thing that caused the original resurrection. The two embrace and kiss, only to find that a bloody Alexis is tearing her way out of Terry's corpse (as he had landed on her grave) and screaming Leena's name. The film then cuts to the title card, which reveals that the film is part one in a series and that there will be a sequel.

The film holds an approval rating of 50% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 4.96/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"All Cheerleaders Die sets out to subvert horror tropes, but ends up falling victim to many of the same trashy cliches it's trying to mock.\\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". We Got This Covered praised the film for its originality, and summed the film up by saying \\"Mindless and contrived at points, no doubt, but All Cheerleaders Die is undeniably a witching, bitching good time worthy of the cliffhanger ending that suggests a future sequel may be in the cards.\\" Fearnet also gave a positive review, writing: \\"What's probably most amusing about All Cheerleaders Die is that it will probably earn a lot of rentals from young male horror fans who smile at the idea of five evil succubi and the promise of some lesbian kissing -- when it's actually a very smart and subversive satire about the way women are (very) often objectified in horror films.\\" In contrast, Reel Film panned the film for being overly bland and not fully utilizing its premise, which the reviewer felt had promise.

As of January 2, 2018, upon the completion of its acquisition of Allied Building Products, the company had 589 locations throughout all 50 states and six Canadian provinces, and over 8,500 employees. In addition to roofing, local divisions may also sell windows, siding, decking, waterproofing, and other external building products. The company is currently headquartered in Herndon, Virginia.  Company history  Beacon was established in 1928 in Charlestown, Massachusetts, as Beacon Sales Company. By 1953, the company had outgrown its building in Charlestown, and built a new facility in nearby Somerville. In the 1970s, the company expanded to Worcester, Massachusetts, and Lewiston, Maine. In 1984, Andrew Logie bought a majority interest in the company. At that time, sales were almost $17 million, virtually all in commercial roofing. Shortly after Logie became CEO, David Grace joined Beacon as the company's chief financial officer. During Logie's tenure, the company opened new branches throughout the United States, and expanded into residential roofing as well as commercial roofing. By 1997, seven branches were generating $72 million in annual sales In 1997, the equity firm Code, Hennessy & Simmons III, L.P. purchased a majority interest in the company. They re-branded it as Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. In 1998, Beacon, in an attempt to acquire successful distributors, purchased its first regional brand, Quality Roofing Supply, a Pennsylvania based roofing distributor. From 1999 to 2000, Beacon continued its purchase of regional roofing distributors by acquiring Best Distributing (North Carolina), Groupe Bedard and Exeltherm Supply (Canada), The Roof Center (Maryland and Virginia), and West End Lumber (Texas). By 2002, Beacon had surpassed $500 million in revenue. Early in fiscal 2004, Robert R. Buck joined the company and succeed Andrew Logie as president and CEO. To obtain money to grow the company, Beacon went public with an initial public offering on the NASDAQ stock exchange, on September 23, 2004. In 2005, The Wall Street Journal ranked Beacon as the sixth-fastest- growing new stock issue behind Google. The company continued to acquire successful distributors across North America and drive organic growth in existing operations. Within three months of the IPO, Beacon acquired Atlanta- based JGA Corp., which had sales of $74 million. In October 2005, Beacon's made its largest acquisition by purchasing Shelter Distribution, a midwestern distributor with sales of $313 million and 50 branches. Other additions in 2005 and 2006 included Mississippi Roofing, Alabama Roofing, Pacific Supply, Minnesota’s Roof Depot, and RSM Supply in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. Sales surpassed $850 million in fiscal 2005 and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2006. In April 2007, Beacon acquired North Coast Commercial Roofing Systems based in Twinsburg, Ohio, which had sales in excess of $250 million. This strategic acquisition moved Beacon into three new states—Ohio, New York and West Virginia. At this point, operations now encompassed 172 branches in 37 states and 3 Canadian provinces. In October 2007, Beacon announced the appointment of Paul M. Isabella as president and chief operating officer. At the end of 2010, Robert Buck relinquished the title of CEO to Paul Isabella while retaining the title of chairman of the board. Today, Buck remains actively involved with the investment community, acquisitions and monitoring organizational structure and leadership. In fiscal 2011, Beacon increased sales by 12.9% to a record $1.82 billion. The company also expanded further into Canada with the acquisitions of Enercon Products in May, a Western Canada roofing distributor with six locations. In fiscal 2012, the company exceeded $2 billion in sales for the first time. During 2012, the company also made several strategic acquisitions and opened several new branches which expanded its market coverage. In May 2012, the company acquired Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, headquartered Cassady Pierce, which was founded in 1947 and has six locations in and around the Western Pennsylvania area. A few weeks later, the company announced the opening of their 200th location in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. On July 1, 2012, Beacon acquired Southern California based Structural Materials Co. The acquisition more than doubled the size of the company's market penetration in the Southern California region. Shortly after fiscal 2013 began, the company acquired McClure-Johnston Co. which expanded the company's footprint in the Pennsylvania region. In 2014, Beacon again expanded its operations again by acquiring Wholesale Roofing Supply based out of Dallas, Texas, All Weather Products based out of Vancouver, and Applicators Sales & Service in New England. In 2019, the transformative acquisition of Allied Building Products was completed and Beacon was named to the Fortune 500.Annual Report, \\"2018 Beacon Roofing Supply Annual Report\\", Retrieved 2019-11-01.Fortune magazine, \\"Beacon Roofing Supply in Fortune 500\\", Retrieved 2019-11-01.

It was built to attract the lumber shipping trade by transplanted San Franciscan Henry Meiggs as part of his real estate development plans for what would become the North Beach area of San Francisco. Though it bankrupted him in the process, it would become a major part of North Beach and San Francisco society life. The Pier The pier was exceptionally long for its day, regarded by many as built in the wrong place: currents and tides ran strong at the northern tip of San Francisco off North Beach, and ships at dock were not protected by a breakwater as they were further inside San Francisco Bay at the Embarcadero. Most ships preferred the quieter waters and sailed on to safer berths there. Henry Meiggs Anchored between north-south Mason and Powell Streets and a bit north of where east-west Bay Street (the old beach frontage) now runs, Meiggs' Wharf stretched at least and possibly as much as into the bay. This is some further out than today's Fisherman's Wharf. Financially, Meiggs' pier and its associated real estate developments ruined Meiggs. The 'Father of North Beach,' tried to cover his shortfalls with illicitly obtained warrants against the San Francisco Street Fund. Before his fraud was discovered he fled on 6 October 1854 on his brig America with his family and brother, John Meiggs, the newly elected City Controller. He landed in Chile, where after losing $8,000 in stake money and pawning his pocket watch he would make another large fortune building Chilean and Peruvian railroads. Meigg would use a part of his new wealth to repay victims of the fraud. After Meiggs' flight in 1854 the pier was left without an owner. Local merchant Abraham Warner opened the Cobweb Palace saloon and eatery in 1856 at the foot of the wharf. Stuffed with curios, it proved successful and served as an early social gathering spot for the entire city regardless of class. The pier became the southern terminus for the ferry to Marin County. The wharf itself survived until it was burned to the water on the second day of the conflagration that devastated San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake. Over time, the North Beach area expanded and became a thriving part of San Francisco, bearing out Meiggs' hopeful vision of the area.

Hans Petterson studied Sciences at Uppsala University, graduating in 1909. He then studied atomic physics as a postgraduate at the Institute for Radium Research, Vienna. Career Petterson's first publication from 1910 was on the issue of radium. In 1913 he joined the staff of the Swedish Hydrographic-Biologocal Commission. In 1914 he began lecturing in Oceanography at Gothenburg University. He later brought this knowledge to the field of oceanography, and with the help of radium he could determine the age of sediment samples from the bottom of the sea. Pettersson became the first full professor of oceanography in Sweden and in 1938 founded the Institute of Oceanography in Gothenburg, thanks to funding from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation. Pettersson was its head until 1956. He also was the head of the Bornö Hydrographic Field Station on Stora Bornö. In 1956, aged 68, he became Professor of Geophysics at the University of Hawaii. Petterson also wrote many popular scientific texts which helped disseminate progress in oceanography to the general audience. In July 1947, the Albatross expedition started its around the world voyage with Pettersson as leader of the expedition. This expedition was planned by him, and was financed by private sponsors. He died in Gothenburg on 25 January 1966.

Biography  Phrynon was born in Athens before 657 BC. In 636 BC he won the stadion or pentathlon in the Olympic Games (36th Olympiad).Eusebius of Caesarea, Chronicle. Later he became a general of Athens. In the period 608–606 BC a war was conducted by Athens against Mytilene over control of Sigeum. Phrynon was the general of the Athenians. In order to end the conflict quickly, Phrynon accepted the invitation to duel made by the Mytilenean general Pittacus (one of the Seven Sages of Greece). Phrynon was defeated at the duel, because Pittacus had a hidden net beneath his shield and with it caught and killed him.Philosophes de Diogène Laërce (in French). Chapter IV (Pittacus), p. 74. Pittacus thus won the war for his homeland. The aristocrat and poet Alcaeus of Mytilene wrote several poems about this conflict. The Athenian soldiers received the corpse of their general, and withdrawing from Mytilene carried it back to Athens, where Phrynon was buried with honors. Herodotus mentions the struggle between Athens and Mytilene in the context of Peisistratos and does not restrict himself to the time of Peisistratos, but freely goes back to an earlier stage of what he says was a protructed struggle. Theodore Wade-Gery notes Phrynon as founder of colonies at Sigeum and Elaious—instead of Achilleion by tradition—and accepting the emendation which produces Phrynon's name at Ps. Skymnos 707f.

It which reached No. 22 in the UK Singles Chart, and was inspired by the punchline of a 1977 television commercial for Campari featuring Lorraine Chase. Production In the 1977 Campari television commercial, model and actress Lorraine Chase is shown being wooed by Jeremy Clyde over drinks. In response to his romantic line \\"Were you truly wafted here from paradise?\\" she replies in a strong Cockney accent, \\"Nahh, Luton Airport!\\". The humorous punchline became very popular, and in 1979, songwriter Paul Curtis and record producer John Worsley came up with the idea for a song while on holiday in Majorca. Curtis was already well known for writing several UK Eurovision Song Contest entries. The writers approached Jill Shirley about finding suitable singers for the group. Shirley had been involved with the UK heats for Eurovision for a number of years and would go on to form Bucks Fizz, Gem and Bardo. The song was also offered to Lorraine Chase, but she refused it. Finally it was offered to the UK girl band Cats U.K. The lead singer was Bea Rowley who, as a leading TV dancer who had worked with many of the major choreographers of the 1980s including Geoff Richer, Nigel Lithco and Arlene Phillips. The band also included Deena Payne (who coincidentally went on to appear with Chase in the long-running soap opera Emmerdale). Payne, along with two others supplied the backing vocals. The song was produced by Paul Curtis and John Worsley at WEA records. Release The song made number 22 on the UK Singles Chart after being featured in an advert for Campari. In a 2010 interview, Deena Payne incorrectly claimed that the song reached number 9: Some releases of the record featured a censored version, which bleeped out the line \\"Sod it\\" from the lyrics. Although released with the same catalogue number (K 18075), this version is easily identifiable due to the word Bleeped added above the title on the record label. Cats UK released two further singles, Sixteen Looking for Love and Holiday Camp (both 1980), which failed to reach the charts. The group was disbanded. Both the song and the name of the group likely drew inspiration from the early 1979 Squeeze hit \\"Cool for Cats,\\" which featured a cockney vocal and similar chord changes and lyrical cadences.

Hämatom developed their style from Neue Deutsche Härte. The band concept is based on forming a unity between musical and visual elements, leading to the idea of naming the bandmembers after the four cardinal directions and incorporating intricately designed masks. In the early years their German lyrics were influenced by European fables, which in time and with the progression of the band transitioned to themes based on societal, religious and socio-critical issues. The band has released five studio albums since 2004 and is increasingly gaining chart presence, with the last album Wir Sind Gott entering the charts at No. 5. The focal points of the band are their live performances and the organisation of their own festivals Dämonentanz and Das laute Abendmahl with friends of associated bands. History After their formation in 2004, Hämatom played their first shows in the Franconia vicinity. In April 2005, the band went on tour with J.B.O. selling their self-produced single \\"Butzemann\\". The following single \\"Häschen\\" was a taster of the upcoming EP Nein. The self-distributed EP Nein was released in September 2005 and comprised nine tracks, some of which were inspired by European fables and nursery rhymes. In 2005, the band also supported Knorkator in Nuremberg and played Earthshaker-Fest with bands such as Nightwish and Manowar and the Burning Fall Festival with Six Feet Under amongst others. In February 2006, the first headlining tour carried the band through 10 cities all over Germany. On this tour the band offered a special tour single featuring the songs \\"Leck mich!\\", \\"Schmerz\\" and \\"Mit dem Kopf durch die Wand\\", which were to be released on the following album Wut. In autumn 2006, the band toured as a support act for Die Apokalyptischen Reiter through 14 cities of the Republic. The year 2007 began with J.B.O.’s Rock-Muzik-Tour through Germany, Austria and Switzerland, in which they accompanied Hämatom on their first progression beyond the German borders. In April, the band signed with the record label Megapress to distribute the album Wut via Soulfood. The album was released on 25 January 2008. The song \\"Leck mich!\\" from this album quickly became the fan- anthem and was celebrated vociferously at concerts. On 15 January 2010, the band released their second album with the title Stay Kränk. In 2011 the band played Wacken Open Air and the Walpurgis-Schlacht at the Hexentanz Festival. On 30 September 2011, the third album Wenn man vom Teufel spricht was released and Hämatom performed at on3-südwild. The album entered at position No. 60 of the chart. The 200th show in March 2012 was captured for a Live-DVD and CD release, which was released in September with the title Schutt und Asche and again, directly entered the chart at No. 8. In July 2013, the band accepted the invitation to play Sofia-Rocks-Festival in Bulgaria to support Rammstein. On 22 September 2013, the fourth album Keinzeitmensch was released. The single \\"Alte Liebe rostet nicht\\" was published as a pre-release title. From October onwards, the band continued to tour through Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In mid 2014 they began working with producer Kristian Kohlmannslehner in his studio Kohlekeller Studios on their album X.

This winter festival with the name Dämonentanz has been a fixed calendar instalment ever since. The extensive festival season of 2015 led the band to their first performance at Summer Breeze Open Air followed by the Heidenfest-Tour with Die Apokalyptischen Reiter and Korpiklaani through Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In January 2016, Hämatom released the first single \\"Fick das System\\" from the 25 March release Wir sind Gott, which entered the chart at No. 5 and stayed within the top 100 for several weeks. They also charted in Austria (No. 24) and Switzerland (No. 69). The sold-out release show at Aladin in Bremen on Good Friday was repeated in 2017 and has since also become a fixed annual instalment in Hämatom, band friends and fans calendars.

Early life and career  Knut Wulff's father, Gustav Wulff, a German hairdresser and perfumer, moved to Malmö, Sweden from Hamburg in 1910, together with his brother Hermann Wulff.Stil: Knut Wulff – den svenske skönhetspionjären som med fransk flärd skapade Nordens största skönhetsföretag, Pierre Robert, Sveriges Radio, 2012-12-28 After having initially worked at Salong Sauer, he start his own hairdressing salon together with his brother. Later, the Swedish king Gustav V of Sweden, a frequent visitor in Scania, became his prominent customer. Gustav Wulff’s most successful product was an herbal hair tonic for men. In 1930 Gustav’s 17-year-old son Knut took over his father's salon in Malmö. He later expanded with beauty salons in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Copenhagen. It became an enterprise with eight subsidiaries and eighty employees. Thanks to his summertime hairdressing in Falsterbo from 1937, he had a royal customer just as his father had. He was the first who cut the hair of future king Carl XVI Gustaf, when the prince was a few years old.Visual Arkiv på nätet: Wulff, Knut, accessed 2013-08-10  Career in cosmetics  Wulff also started production and marketing of his own cosmetics products. This first successful product was the skin lotion LdB, short for Lait de Beauté, French for \\"beauty milk\\". This product was created in 1945 in Wulff's cellar, apparently with the aid of a food processor. Wulff was assisted by an Estonian pharmacist by the name Tönnisson when he created LdB and several other products. Wulff's products were launched in 1946 under the company name Monsieur Robert, which was changed into Pierre Robert in 1964.Tuff kamp om skönhet, Dagens Nyheter 2006-11-13 Wulff claimed that he had purchased a recipe and the production rights from a Monsieur Robert in Paris. The truth of this has been questioned, also by his own son,Pierre Wulff is perfumer in New York, Scandinavian Traveller 2017-05-20 and probably Wulff simply chose a French-sounding name for marketing reason, since France was associated with luxury and fashion. Pierre Robert was quite successful, in particular in the Swedish market, became a royal purveyor in 1955, and had its larger market share in the 1970s, when the company supplied about half of the hair products and one-third of the cosmetics to the Swedish market. In 1975 Wulff sold Pierre Robert AB and the company's brands to Unilever, after several years of proposals from Unilever. Wulff stayed on as CEO until his retirement in 1978. Unilever closed down their cosmetics production in Sweden in mid-1990s, and several of Pierre Robert's old brands were purchased in 1998 by Malmö businessman Kent Widding and his company Hardford. Wulff regretted having sold his company, but considered that it was difficult to continue as owner due to the poor Swedish business climate in the 1970s.  Founding new company  After his retirement, Wulff did not want to leave the cosmetics business, and went into herbal cosmetics, made from natural vegetable extracts. A series of products called Fleur de Santé (French for \\"flower of health\\") was developed with the aid of four suppliers. In 1980 the company Fleur de Santé was started, owned half by Knut Wulff, and half by Fortia, the publicly traded holding company of Pharmacia. Fleur de Santés products were sold by mail order, which was an expanding sales channel at this time, and also in some 20 Fleur de Santé shops run as franchises. Fleur de Santé was later purchased by the mail order company Ellos.

He was orphaned soon after arriving, and he turned to painting to support himself. He sold his first painting to Fiorello La Guardia at the age of 15. He painted Manhattan's Union Square and Greenwich Village areas throughout his life, as well as Coney Island, Washington Square, the Bronx Zoo, and seascapes. Working predominately in oil and painting on canvas, his style has been characterized as having a renaissance compensation while using impressionist color. During World War II he served with the U.S. army and was stationed at Fort Jay, New York. After the war he received Veterans scholarships and studied at the Arts Students League and the Academy of Rome. He worked as a muralist and easel painter. He supervised various programs in the WPA creating many works. Many of his paintings are in museums and private collections.

Early life  Rose Mooney came from a poor background in County Meath. Like many harpists of the time, she was blind. Mooney learned how to play from Thady Elliott. With her maid Mary for a companion, she traveled Ireland for different harpist competitions. Harp festivals = Granard Harp Festival = The memoirs of harpist Arthur O'Neill contain records of Mooney's experience at the Granard Festivals. She was the only woman to compete in the Granard festival of 1781. Third place and five guineas went to Mooney for her rendering of Planxty Burke. She continued to participate, and won third place in the 2nd and 3rd Granard festivals of 1782 and 1783. This time her reward was four guineas. She participated in the last two festivals of 1784 and 1785 as well, but it is unclear where she placed. From the second festival, she was not the only woman competitor, as Catherine Martin also participated. = Belfast Harp Festival = In 1792, founding Belfast Reading Society members Henry Joy McCracken and Dr. James McDonnel called on the Harpers Assembly in Belfast to revive the Ancient tradition of the harp. The festival ran from 11 July to 14 July 1792. Mooney, then 52, participated. She rehearsed with the rest of the harpers in public until the final show in the assembly rooms. 15 judges presided. Edward Bunting attended the festival to transcribe the harp music into a manuscript to preserve it. The result of Mooney's participation in the festival is unknown, as it seems the judges awarded only a first and second place, and no information about the rest of the participants is available. According to Arthur O'Neill, Mooney \\"...pledged her harp, petticoat, and cloak.\\" He made this statement to expose Mooney's maid, Mary, who seems to have taken advantage of her mistress' blindness by pawning her items to buy herself alcohol. Mary led Mooney into seedy establishments that were \\"inseparable for poor blind harpers.\\"  Death  The date and circumstances of Mooney's death are unclear. According to O'Neill, she died during the French invasion of Killala in 1798 as a victim of drink. However, Edward Bunting notes Planxty Charles Coot as having been taken down from \\"Rose Mooney the harper in 1800.\\"  References  Category:1740 births Category:Blind musicians Category:Irish harpists Category:Musicians from County Meath Category:Year of death unknown ","title":"Rose Mooney"},{"id":"40189120","text":"Maldives competed at the 2013 World Aquatics Championships in Barcelona, Spain between 19 July and 4 August 2013.

History The islands comprising the Wisconsin Islands Wilderness were initially declared a national preserve and breeding ground for migratory birds around 1913, and designated as wildlife refuges shortly thereafter. Plum Island and Pilot Island both have lighthouse facilities (the Plum Island Range Lights and the Pilot Island Light, both on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places), and have had minor U.S. Coast Guard presence, even as late as 2007.\\\\- FWS.gov. Retrieved 8 Aug 2013 However, Spider, Hog, and Gravel Islands have always remained uninhabited. In 1970, these three islands were designated a wilderness area under the Wilderness Act. Description The Wisconsin Islands Wilderness is managed by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and is composed of three islands in Lake Michigan: * Spider Island, off the eastern coast of the tip of the Door Peninsula near Newport State Park. At , it is the largest of the three islands. Spider Island is also designated as part of Gravel Island National Wildlife Refuge. * Gravel Island, a island also off the eastern coast of the Door Peninsula, near Europe Bay, and the source of the name for the Gravel Island National Wildlife Refuge. * Hog Island, a island off the eastern coast of Washington Island, across the Porte des Morts from the Door Peninsula. Hog Island, along with Plum Island and Pilot Island, make up the Green Bay National Wildlife Refuge. The three islands are largely limestone and dolomite outcroppings of the Niagara Escarpment, exhibit geology typical of changing water levels and glaciation, and rise only a few feet above the surface of Lake Michigan. Canadian yew, red raspberry, and red- berried elder grow on Hog Island, while only the remnants of a mixed birch, cedar, and tamarack forest remains on Spider Island, after having succumbed to thousands of nesting birds. There is no known vegetation on Gravel Island. The nesting grounds of the islands support many types of colonial birds, including shorebirds, seabirds, and ducks. Spider and Gravel Islands are one of the westernmost breeding grounds of the great black-backed gull. All three islands have significant colonies of herring gulls and double-crested cormorants. Caspian terns can be found on Gravel Island. Spider Island also supports a number of waterfowl species, including the American black duck, Canada geese, and the mallard. Red-breasted mergansers and great blue herons can be found on Hog Island. No public access is allowed, due to the fragile nature of the bird habitats. Boaters are required to stay from shore, both to limit accidents on the rocky shoals surrounding the islands and to protect the nesting bird species.

Taggart started putting on gigs in his hometown at age 16, frustrated at not being able to get into 18+ gigs. Soon after this, he began to DJ regularly at local nightclubs. By the age of 17 he had begun writing for popular music magazine Alternative Ulster. Early radio career While studying at the University of Ulster, Taggart won the BBC/Skillset Young Broadcaster of the Year award for a project he made about the 'Representation of Women in the Music Media.'

Her area of expertise is human papillomavirus (HPV) and the diseases associated with it, as well as colposcopy, and she was the principal investigator of the clinical trials of Gardasil and Cervarix, vaccines against HPV. Early life and education Harper grew up in Kansas City; her father was an electrical and mechanical engineer. Her mother died in 1981, of breast cancer, while Harper was at graduate school. A graduate of the University of Kansas (where she completed a residency in family medicine), Harper also completed undergraduate and graduate degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in chemical engineering, before attending Stanford University and Harvard University to receive her public health degree. Her decision to go to medical school instead of continuing to study engineering was made in 1981, when, on Thanksgiving Day, she called her dad and told him that her heart wasn't in engineering. While at Stanford, she studied medical decision making and cost-effectiveness analysis. Harper's degrees include MD, MPH, and MS. Research and career From 2013 to 2017 she was a professor and chair of the department of Family and Geriatric Medicine at the University of Louisville. From 2009 to 2013 she was a professor at the University of Missouri Kansas City's department of Biomedical and Health Informatics. From 1996 to 2009 she held a clinical, teaching, and research post at Dartmouth Medical School.

Views on HPV vaccines Harper has stated that Gardasil \\"is a good vaccine and ... is generally safe\\", and told the Guardian \\"I fully support the HPV vaccines ... I believe that in general they are safe in most women.\\" However, since 2009 Harper has questioned the cost-benefit analysis of Gardasil in countries where pap smears are regularly available, and has stated that the vaccine has been overpromoted.Crank “scientific” conferences: A parody of science-based medicine that can deceive even reputable scientists and institutions, Science Based Medicine In a 2011 NPR interview, she argued against mandatory HPV vaccines for schoolchildren, saying \\"Ninety-five percent of women who are infected with HPV never, ever get cervical cancer.\\" In a July 2013 interview, she stated that she advocates personal choice and an individualized approach to HPV vaccination, saying that she provides \\"a balanced picture to my patients and their families and am not at all upset if they refuse the vaccine, especially at younger ages.\\" Harper appeared on a December 2013 episode of Katie Couric's show Katie devoted to the HPV vaccine, and stated that newly developed pap screenings that combine HPV testing and cytology have a nearly 100% ability to detect pre-cancers and cancers; she also said that Gardasil doesn't last long enough to prevent cervical cancer and that there are some harms associated with it.\\"Was the HPV Vaccine Responsible for One Girl's Death?\\" (video) .

Early life and teaching She was born Hypatia Bradlaugh, at 3 Hedger's Terrace, Hackney, London, the second daughter of Charles Bradlaugh, the first openly atheist Member of Parliament and founder of the National Secular Society, and Susannah Lamb Hooper. She was named after Hypatia, the Ancient Greek pagan philosopher, mathematician, astronomer and teacher, who was murdered by a mob of Coptic monks under the authority of Christian archbishop Cyril of Alexandria. Bradlaugh Bonner was educated in private schools in London and Paris, and qualified as a science teacher from the University of London, which admitted women to \\"full privileges\\" (i.e. degrees) in 1878. She taught in the Hall of Science for the South Kensington Science and Art Examinations, and also acted as a secretary for her father after 1888. The Halls of Science were mainly for adult education and self-help, like those offered by Mechanics' Institutes and religious organisations at the time.Royle (1976), p.118 The South Kensington Hall of Science was started by Edward Aveling, and other teachers included her sister Alice Bradlaugh (1856–1888) and Annie Besant. The results from the South Kensington Hall of Science were very good, with students exceeding the national average on their examinations in all but one of their offered classes.Royle (1980), p.319. Bonner was also a lecturer for the National Secular SocietyRoyle (1980), p.151. and the Rationalist Press Association.Royle (1980), p.167. Writing Bonner is most remembered for being the author of her father's biography, Charles Bradlaugh: His Life and Work. The Spectator considered the two volumes to be more memoirs than a biography: \\"That it is preposterously long is manifest at once. More than eight hundred closely printed pages are too much for Charles Bradlaugh, viewed in regard to his real importance in the world\\", but accepted, \\"A day will come when they will be found useful\\". From 1897 to 1904, she was editor of The Reformer, the main purpose of which according to Bernard Porter was to \\"vindicate her father's career\\". However, she was an active contributor to many secularist periodicals including the National Reformer and author of many other books relating to secularism, blasphemy and freethinking. In Penalties upon Opinion she catalogues various trials and cases of blasphemy including the recent revival in blasphemy prosecutions in the first decades of the 20th century. Peace activism In the lead up to the First World War most peace societies were Christian associations. In 1910, Bonner became the chairperson of the first secular peace society, the Rationalist Peace Society.Royle (1980), p.213. The aim of the society was to \\"protest against ideas and methods which are utterly opposed to reason and the interests of social progress\\". In her introduction to Essays towards peace, Hypatia noted that there was a \\"growing public opinion in favour of arbitration as the alternative to war\\" and that it was reason that demonstrated \\"the futility, the brutality, the economic waste, the immorality of war\\". The Rationalist Peace Society remained active throughout the war, but fell into decline after peace was concluded. Personal life Bonner's grave in Brookwood Cemetery She married Arthur Bonner in 1885 in Marylebone, London. They had two children, Kenneth (June – September 1886) and Charles Bradlaugh Bonner (28 April 1890 – 2 September 1966). She died at home on 25 August 1935 at 23 Streathbourne Road, Tooting, London, after an abdominal operation for cancer. She was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 28 August, and her ashes were buried in her father's grave at Brookwood Cemetery.

Subsequently, the game was released on Android and iOS on September 5, 2014. The games received a mixed to positive reviews. It was mostly praised for its art and soundtrack. Gameplay CounterSpy is a 2.5D side-scroller with stealth elements and randomly generated levels. Set in an alternate version of the Cold War, players play as a counter agent sent to infiltrate the bases of opposing countries in order to prevent either of them from launching nuclear weapons. Movement largely takes place on a 2D plane, whilst specially marked areas allow the player aim their weapon in 3D space. The games atmosphere is heavily inspired by 60s spy mythologies such as James Bond, and The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Score multiplier is awarded for making consecutive stealth kills. The main aim of the game is to collect enemy plans which help to further the story and shut down the base's weapon at the end of each level. Players can also collect intel, which serves as the game's currency, as well as plans which unlock new weapons and special formulas. Prior to each mission, players can spend intel to refill ammo, purchase and equip unlocked weapons, or equip up to three single use formulas which make the game easier, such as increased stealth or health. If a player beats a rival player's score, they can encounter them during the next level and retrieve bonus intel from them. The main thing the player must be cautious about is the DEFCON status of both sides. This raises if the player is caught by security cameras or if a guard is allowed to radio in after becoming suspicious, and will automatically go up a level if the player is killed. Players can lower the DEFCON status by forcing white-uniformed officers to surrender without killing them, or by using a certain formula. If the DEFCON status reaches DEFCON 1, the player will have a limited amount of time to reach the end of the level and shut down the weapon before it is launched, at which point the game will end. Development The game was developed with assistance from SIE Foster City Studio. While historically known for collaborating with the series' respective large development studios, CounterSpy marks the first time they've teamed up with an indie development team, Dynamighty. The team comprises past staff from LucasArts and Pixar.  Reception  Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 3/5, saying \\"CounterSpys awesome improvisational take on stealth can be hindered by both framerate inconsistencies and occasional perspective oddities.\\" IGN rated it 7/10, praising the game's concept, art and soundtrack while citing the inconsistent AI and \\"occasional control issues\\". Polygon also praised the game's overall presentation, \\"but its interactivity is ugly enough to make for an unfortunate pairing when the balance is measured\\" and rated it 5/10.

It originally aired on MTV on July 13, 2010. In the episode, Lo Bosworth moves into a house with her boyfriend, while Stephanie Pratt begins a romantic relationship. Audrina Patridge finds a house in Hermosa Beach, and Kristin Cavallari decides to leave Los Angeles and move to Europe. The series' final scene reveals that her departure to the airport was filmed in a studio backlot, responding to longtime speculation that the program was scripted. \\"All Good Things...\\" was produced by Adam DiVello, Michael Friedman, Liz Gateley, Josh Lansky, Kristofer Lindquist, and Sara Mast. In addition to being the final episode, it serves as the twelfth installment of the sixth season. The episode received mixed reviews from critics, who were ambivalent towards the final scene. According to Nielsen ratings, it was watched by 3 million viewers, becoming the peak viewership of the season. The episode was released on DVD on September 21, 2010, packaged with the remainder of the sixth season. Upon the conclusion of their month-long morning marathon of The Hills, titled \\"RetroMTV Brunch\\", MTV aired an alternate ending to the series on August 9, 2013. The scene replaced the original backlot clip with footage of Jenner and Lauren Conrad talking in his apartment. Critics appreciated Conrad's return, but also felt that the revision was less shocking than the original clip. Plot As Audrina, Lo, Stephanie find themselves content with their lives, Kristin is unsure whether she should pursue her future endeavors. Brody believes that he can maintain a friendship with Kristin, though Frankie and Taylor are concerned that she may still have romantic feelings towards him. That evening, Kristin tells Stacie that she has decided to move to Europe, wanting to have a \\"new beginning\\", though Stacie is concerned that she is seeking revenge against Brody. Meanwhile, Audrina purchases a home in Hermosa Beach, while Stephanie begins a romantic relationship with Josh. To the surprise of the guests, Brody attended Kristin's farewell party that evening. He confesses that he is saddened by her move, but she maintains that the decision is in her best interest. The next day, after much prior deliberation, Lo moves into her boyfriend Scott's house and begins unpacking her belongings. Brody visits Kristin and Stacie as they pack the last of her belongings before leaving for the airport. After giving their final goodbyes, Brody sees Kristin's limousine off while it drives off her street. As Kristin looks out of the window, a montage of archived footage from the series' earlier seasons is shown. In the final scene of the series, with the camera on Brody, the Hollywood Hills backdrop is pulled away, while the camera pans back to reveal that the entire scene was filmed on a backlot. In reality, the vehicle had not driven off and Kristin stepped out of the vehicle to hug Jenner. An alternate ending to the series was broadcast in August 2013. The scene depicts Brody returning to his apartment after seeing Kristin's limousine off to Europe. Lauren Conrad is revealed to be sitting on his couch, and comforts him that \\"it's hard to say goodbye\\" to a \\"friend of [his]\\", before the camera focuses on a smiling Lauren. Production \\"All Good Things...\\" was produced by Adam DiVello, Michael Friedman, Liz Gateley, Josh Lansky, Kristofer Lindquist, and Sara Mast. The sixth season was first announced in December 2009, and was confirmed to be the final season in March 2010. Upon the announcement, speculation arose that original focal point Lauren Conrad would return for the finale. Her former boss Lisa Love suggested that a scene could be filmed of the pair reuniting in Paris, while series creator DiVello wished to see Conrad getting married, presumably to her then-boyfriend Kyle Howard. Cavallari stated that it would be \\"amazing\\" to see Conrad return, adding that her appearance would provide the program with \\"closure\\". Ultimately, Conrad did not appear in the final episode, but was featured in the live aftershow, The Hills Live: A Hollywood Ending. DiVello stated that two versions of the final installment were filmed. He provided the MTV with both episodes, and added that he was unaware which version had been selected until it was broadcast. In July 2010, Jenner stated that he had filmed an alternate ending of the series with Conrad, where \\"I [would] come back home, and basically Lauren's at my place [and I tell her about saying goodbye to a friend]. We filmed this whole lovey- dovey scene as if me and Lauren had been together this entire time\\", which she confirmed that September. Upon the conclusion of their month-long morning marathon of The Hills, titled \\"RetroMTV Brunch\\", MTV aired the alternate ending to the series on August 9, 2013, which was revealed to be the clip Conrad and Jenner had previously mentioned. DiVello had stated that he preferred the second ending, and upon learning that MTV had not selected it as the original finale, persuaded the network to broadcast the clip. Reception and release \\"All Good Things...\\" was met with generally mixed reviews from critics, many of whom were ambivalent towards the final scene. Despite criticizing the episode's recurring theme of moving on, Emma Rosenblum from Vulture appreciated the ending as an \\"interesting twist\\". Andy Dehnart of Reality Blurred felt that, from a production standpoint, the final scene was \\"really well-done\\" and appeared realistic despite being filmed in a backlot. In contrast, Chadwick Matlin was displeased to see producers \\"capitalizing\\" on the controversy surrounding longtime scripting allegations, which he felt exploited its naive teenage fanbase. A writer for Daily News described the episode as \\"bittersweet\\" and \\"emotional\\", but felt that the program \\"overstayed its welcome\\". Megan Friedman from Time called the ending \\"surprisingly smart\\", but felt it did not leave an impact on viewers who were already skeptical of the series' truthfulness. Similarly, critics were ambivalent towards the alternate finale. Jenna Mullins from E! praised Conrad's return as being \\"shocking and glorious at the same time\\", and felt that \\"clearly [viewers] should all prefer the ending with Lauren Conrad.\\" Kaitlin Reilly from Bustle described the suggestion of another love triangle involving Conrad and Cavallari to \\"[feel] vaguely like the ending to a horror movie\\" in that \\"it's starting again\\", but nonetheless appreciated the ending as \\"a wink to loyal fans\\". Billy Niles from Zap2It noted that there was \\"no winking nod to a soundstage\\", and opined that \\"nothing that freaking awesome happened.\\" Sonya Sorich of the Ledger-Enquirer preferred the original conclusion, commenting that the revised clip was not as \\"startling\\" as the first. Lindsey Weber from Vulture suggested that the footage felt like a \\"total soap opera\\" in that it seemingly acknowledged that portions of the series were fabricated. In its original broadcast in the United States on July 13, 2010, \\"All Good Things...\\" was watched by 3 million viewers. In doing so, it became the peak viewership of the season. In the country, the sixth season was released as a two-disc DVD set on September 21, 2010.

The station was built by the Canada Southern Railway and last had train service in 1979. It is now home to the North America Railway Hall of Fame. Historically, the station was, at one time, one of the busiest train stations in Canada, headquarters to the Canada Southern Railway and is currently owned by, and home to the North America Railway Hall of Fame. Since the CASO Station was acquired by the North America Railway Hall of Fame in 2005, the goal is to restore the station to its \\"illustrious state of the 1914-1925 eras\\" North America Railway Hall of Fame and the Canada Southern Railway Station Information Package (February 2013) The proposed station The Canada Southern Railway line ran from Detroit to Buffalo. It provided an efficient path for travelers who took the short route through southern Ontario. As the line grew, the town of St. Thomas, Ontario offered a $25,000 bonus to the Canada Southern Railway if they built their head offices within the borders of the town.The North America Railway Hall of Fame  History: The Canada Southern Railway The Canada Southern acquiesced and the CASO station was built. As a direct result, the population of St. Thomas quadrupled in the span of not much more than a decade. Architecture and design Though it was one of 31 railway station built in Ontario during the 1870s, CASO was unique, in that it was designed in an Italianate style by Canadian architect Edgar Berryman (1839-1905), and is thought to be the only station of that type in Canada. It is also the largest of them all. More common designs for major railway stations of the times included Romanesque, Beaux-Arts and Second Empire architectural styles.Robert Hunter, \\"Former Canada Southern Railway Station,\\" (Hull, QC: Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada Railway Station Report, ca. 1890) The building itself is 107.9 metres (354 feet) long and 10.9 metres (36 feet) wide. The station boast two storeys, both with ceilings of approximately 5.5-6.1 metres (18–20 feet) featuring 164 arched windows. Its original 400 000 white brick construction was later painted red to suit the style of the day.North America Railway Hall of Fame  Inductee: Canada Southern Station The original cost of the CASO station was estimated at between $10,000 - $12,000 in 1873. The 115 metre south side boardwalk containing century-old bricks was renovated in 2017; the 40 000 bricks were removed for safe keeping until they were reinstalled in the fall of 2016 with the help of a Federal Heritage Grant. The bricks stamped \\"SAGINAW\\" were made in Saginaw, Michigan. Facilities The Canada Southern Station did double duty. It became a busy \\"port of call\\" for numerous lines, while the second floor of the building was home to the Canadian head offices of the Canada Southern Line. Currently, much of the second floor is rented out and generates revenue to maintain the station. Features of the restored Canada Southern Railway Station include the single men's waiting room, the ladies or family waiting room, ticket office, station master's office and mail room. The CASO station also had a large dining room, now renamed Anderson Hall, with a live- in staff of a cook and several lady servers. They lived in modest quarters upstairs, above the kitchen and dining room. The dining room was quite elegant and travelers could wire their menu orders ahead in time for their arrival. A fire in 1925 severely damaged the kitchen and, combined with the advent of dining cars on passenger trains, the dining hall was relegated to more of a lunch room. By October 2005, with the restoration efforts at the station underway, the first meal in 80 years was served in the dining room – at a wedding reception.North America Railway Hall of Fame (Policy Manual; Section One: Introduction to NARHF) Since that time, The Canada Southern Railway Station (or the CASO station) is maintained in part by revenue from the rental of both Anderson Hall and the Ladies waiting room for weddings, wedding receptions, ceremonies, luncheons, dinners, teas, conferences and corporate events. Also located at the CASO Station were the Michigan Central Railroad car manufacturing shops. Also, it was here that master mechanic, Thomas William Cottrell helped establish the MCR shops as a regional repair shops for locomotives, rather than sending them to the United States for repair. (Cottrell was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame in 2006 for his contribution to the railway industry in the category of \\"Local: Railway Worker & Builder.\\") Heritage =Federal Listing= The station is protected under Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act since 1989. =Ontario Heritage Trust= An Ontario Heritage Trust plaque locate there reads: > The St. Thomas Canada Southern (CASO) Station, financed by American railway > promoters, was constructed between 1871 and 1873 to serve as both the > passenger station for St. Thomas and CASO's corporate headquarters.

His dates of birth and death are not known. Early career Son of another painter of the same name, it was documented that Bernat \\"promised to end within two years the altar of Santo Domingo de Silos left in Daroca unfinished by Bartolome Bermejo\\". The altarpiece, probably dismantled in the eighteenth century as a result of a fire suffered by the church, preserved in the Museo del Prado central table with the effigy of the owner, probably the only fully completed by Bermejo, and depicting the king Fernando I of Castile welcoming Santo Domingo de Silos. According to the documentation Bernat work was completed or retouched by Bermejo in incarnations. Between 1479 and 1484 he appears again documented together with Bartolomé Bermejo, busy restoring the polychrome altarpiece of the Cathedral and the painting of John de Lobera altarpiece for the chapel of the Visitation of the Pillar of Zaragoza, which now resides in a private collection. Collaborations This collaboration between Bernat and Bermejo left a deep imprint on Bernat and, generally speaking, in the Aragonese painting of the late fifteenth century, where enshrined saint typology created by Bermejo in Santo Domingo de Daroca is repeated often, especially in works attributed to Bernat or his circle, such as the St. Victorian between San Gaudioso and Saint Nazaire Cathedral or the San Blas Barbastro between San Vicente and San Lorenzo of the parish of St. Mary Magdalene of Lécera. Along with Miguel Ximénez, Bernat was hired in 1485 to execute the high altar of the parish church of Blesa in the Province of Teruel, dedicated to the Legend of the Holy Cross, now in the Museum of Zaragoza. The fact that most of the payments were intended to Ximénez, who in 1487 charged and alone, suggests that participation was a minor Bernat contribution. He and his workshop in this altarpiece attributed the stronger character tables \\"primitive\\" and greater proximity to Bermejo, which are located in the attic, with the representation of a number of prophets, and the right side of the street, destined to the Passion of Christ, with scenes of Jesus before Caiaphas, Jesus with the Cross and Descent. Work remains Both painters, independent workshops but often associated in large works, again collaborated in 1489 to decorate the altar of All Saints to the Augustinians of Zaragoza, a lost work which is known from two painters traveled to Barcelona accompanied by a monk of the convent of Aragon, in order to study the high altar of St. Augustine by Jaume Huguet. A year later they came into contact with the Castilian painter Fernando del Rincón, signing a partnership agreement for possible future collaborations. The surviving documents refer to a large number of contracts, and indicate that Bernat enjoyed an excellent reputation and could maintain a fruitful workshop, whose impact can be seen in numerous altarpieces of Aragonese scope. However the only works documented and preserved, with the exception of Blesa altarpiece, are already lost, both of 1493 and listed on the marriage of Maria de Soria painter. This is the altarpieces for the chapel of Talavera or Purification in the Tarazona Cathedral with interesting allegories of the Virtues and the Liberal Arts painted in grisaille, and the church of San Juan Bautista de Zaidín, which has preserved the central table Diocesan and Regional Museum of Lleida.

Marking Bateman's directorial debut, the film stars Bateman as a middle-aged eighth grade dropout who enters the National Golden Quill Spelling Bee through a loophole. It also stars Kathryn Hahn, Rohan Chand, Ben Falcone, Philip Baker Hall, and Allison Janney. Dodge's screenplay for Bad Words was featured on the 2011 Black List and was shortly thereafter picked up by Bateman. In the original script, the story was set at the Scripps National Spelling Bee, but the name was changed to a fictional bee since the filmmakers did not expect Scripps to allow the use of their name in the film. After two other actors declined to play the main character, Bateman decided to take on the role himself, and cast the other roles by a combination of contacting friends and open casting calls. Filming took place in Los Angeles at the end of 2012. The film premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival on September 6, 2013, and had a limited release in the United States on March 14, 2014, expanding to a wide release on March 28. Produced for $10 million, it earned $7.8 million at the theatrical box office. It received mixed reviews from critics: some enjoyed the humor and direction, while others found the main character unlikeable and the humor offensive. Plot Forty-year-old Guy Trilby discovers a loophole in the Golden Quill Spelling Bee which stipulates that participants must have not graduated from the eighth grade, allowing him to enter since he dropped out of middle school. He attends and wins a regional spelling bee, and progresses to the national competition after confrontations with both the parents of children and the spelling bee hosts. He is accompanied by Jenny Widgeon, a relatively unknown journalist hoping to make a story out of his participation in the bee. On the flight to the national spelling bee, Guy meets Chaitanya Chopra, a 10-year-old entrant in the bee who persistently attempts to befriend Guy. Upon his arrival in Los Angeles, Guy meets the director of the spelling bee, Dr. Bernice Deagan, who expresses anger at his participation in the bee and places him and his reporter in a cheap hotel. Guy learns that Chaitanya is staying in the same hotel, and takes him out one night to expose Chaitanya to the wilder side of life: stealing food, drinking, and hiring a prostitute to briefly \\"flash\\" Chaitanya. In the bee, Guy actively tries to distract and disconcert his fellow competitors, at one point insinuating that he was sleeping with another contestant's mother. Despite Dr. Deagan's tampering with the word list to give Guy the most difficult words, he spells long, complicated words with relative ease, impressing and angering both parents and staff at the spelling bee, including the event's founder, Dr. William Bowman. However, the parents petition for his disqualification and the resignation of Deagan. While researching Guy's background, Jenny discovers that Bowman is Guy's father. She reveals this to him and he admits that his prime motivation for entering the bee was to embarrass his father in revenge for abandoning him and his mother when he was a child. Soon before the final stage of the bee, Guy overhears Chaitanya and his father discussing his strategy to win, which is to befriend Guy so that he will allow Chaitanya to win out of guilt. Guy storms into the room and ends his friendship with Chaitanya, despite Chaitanya's pleas that he genuinely wanted to be friends. They later sabotage each other: Guy burns Chaitanya's study book, \\"Todd,\\" and Chaitanya files a false police report, accusing Guy of kidnapping a young girl. Meanwhile, only ten competitors remain in the bee, and the pool is gradually reduced to just Guy and Chaitanya. When a contestant's mother attacks Guy verbally and is subdued by the police on live television, Bowman is forced to intervene, to his embarrassment. Having accomplished his goal, Guy deliberately misspells a word in an effort to let Chaitanya win. To prove his friendship, Chaitanya also misspells his word, and they soon begin to argue. This escalates into a physical fight, and when Bowman attempts to intervene, Chaitanya accidentally hits him with a chair. Although the bee is briefly halted, Bowman allows it to continue after deciding that both Guy and Chaitanya acted in an equally embarrassing manner. Their standoff of deliberately misspelling words continues until Guy intentionally misspells Chaitanya's word so that Chaitanya corrects him, thus causing Chaitanya to win the bee inadvertently. As Guy leaves, content, Chaitanya offers to give him half the winnings and names him co-winner of the bee. Guy writes a note to Bowman explaining his actions, which Bowman refuses to read until Guy reveals himself to be his son, and returns home. He resolves his conflict with Chaitanya by buying an old police car from an auction with his share of the winnings, and helping Chaitanya to chase down his school bullies. Cast Production =Development= Jason Bateman directed Bad Words and cast himself in the main role. Andrew Dodge's screenplay for Bad Words first received attention after its inclusion on the 2011 Black List, an annual survey of the best unproduced screenplays in Hollywood. The script was sent to actor Jason Bateman, who had asked his agent to pursue directorial work, explaining that being able to direct films was \\"really the only reason I've been acting for the last 20 years of this career\\". After Bateman signed on to direct the film, he and Dodge spent a long time revising the script, particularly adjusting parts where the dark humor \\"went a little bit too far\\". In the original script, the story was intended to take place at the Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C. The setting was changed to the fictional Golden Quill Spelling Bee in Los Angeles since Bateman did not expect to receive permission from Scripps to use their name in the film. =Pre-production= Bateman did not initially intend to star in the film, but after approaching two other actors who turned down the role of Guy, he decided to play the main character himself. He felt that it would be easier to play the role himself than to direct another actor to strike the \\"tricky tone\\" required, and to ensure that the character remained likeable despite his bad qualities. Allison Janney and Kathryn Hahn were already friends of Bateman's before making Bad Words, so Bateman simply asked them to star in the film rather than going through a regular casting process. Bateman also reached out to Philip Baker Hall, whom he admired and thought \\"would lend a great deal of pedigree to the film\\", to offer him a role. Child actor Rohan Chand sent in a taped audition in response to a casting call for 10-year-old Indian boys, and was cast as Chaitanya after talking to Bateman through Skype. Bateman drew from his own experiences as a child actor in directing Chand and tried to minimize Chand's exposure to the film's \\"off-color material\\" and nudity. =Filming= The production of Bad Words began in 2012 with a budget of 10 million, financed by MXN Entertainment and Darko Entertainment. Principal photography took place over 29 days at the end of 2012 in Los Angeles, with the Sportsman's Lodge in the San Fernando Valley serving as the location of the national spelling bee final. It was filmed on an Arri Alexa camera by cinematographer Ken Seng, who drew inspiration from the 2002 romantic comedy Punch-Drunk Love in shooting a film that was \\"lit darker than a comedy normally would be\\". Release Bad Words had its world premiere as part of the Special Presentation section of the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival on September 6, 2013. Shortly after the film's premiere screening, it was announced that Focus Features had acquired the worldwide distribution rights for around $7 million. The film was originally scheduled to have a limited release in the United States on March 21, with a wide release following on March 28, 2014; however, the limited release date was later shifted by a week to March 14, 2014 with an expansion on March 21 and the planned wide release on March 28. =Box office= On its opening weekend in limited release, Bad Words earned $113,301 from 6 theaters; on its first weekend of wide release it grossed $2,560,186 from 842 theaters. After playing in theaters for 11 weeks, the film closed with a total box office gross in the United States of $7,779,614. In the United Arab Emirates the film earned $24,723, for a total worldwide gross of $7,804,337. =Home media= Bad Words was released on DVD, Blu-ray Disc, and in video on demand format on July 8, 2014. The DVD and Blu-ray releases include an audio commentary recorded by Jason Bateman, a featurette titled \\"The Minds and Mouths Behind Bad Words\\" and deleted scenes. It has earned $1,628,459 in DVD sales and $1,166,001 in Blu- ray sales, making a total of $2,794,460 in revenue. Reception The film currently holds a 66% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 130 reviews, with an average rating of 6.14/10. The website's critical consensus states: \\"Scabrously funny and gleefully amoral, Bad Words boasts one of Jason Bateman's best performances—and proves he's a talented director in the bargain.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 57 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Positive reviews for the film praised its script, direction and acting. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave Bad Words a grade of A−, praising Dodge's script and Bateman's direction, and describing the film as a \\"balancing act between sulfurously funny hatred and humanity\\". Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun- Times awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, calling it \\"near-perfect\\", \\"brilliant, uncompromising and wickedly funny\\". Variety Justin Chang commended Bateman's directorial debut and the film's \\"often uproarious model of sharp scripting and spirited acting\\", as well as the performances given by Chand, Hahn and Hall. Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers gave Bad Words 3.5 out of 4 stars, writing that the film was \\"a tour de force of comic wickedness\\" in which \\"Bateman shows the same skill as a filmmaker that he does as an actor\\". John DeFore opined in a review for The Hollywood Reporter that the film was \\"scouringly funny\\" and that Bateman showed \\"the same knack for timing and fine shadings of attitude\\" as both the director and the lead actor. The Los Angeles Times Betsy Sharkey enjoyed Bad Words, summarizing it as \\"high-minded, foul- mouthed good nonsense\\" and \\"sarcastic, sanctimonious, salacious, sly, slight and surprisingly sweet\\". Negative reviews, on the other hand, mainly criticized the film's dark humor and the unlikeability of the main character. USA Today Claudia Puig found the film \\"neither believable nor funny\\" and wrote that \\"it's tough to summon sufficiently negative language to describe the unfunny, desperate mess that is Bad Words\\". The Boston Globe critic Peter Keough gave the film 1 star out of 4, finding it unfunny, clichéd and offensive with an unlikeable \\"sociopath\\" as the main character. Richard Corliss of Time thought that the film failed to redeem Guy's character or justify his \\"deification\\", ultimately making it boring and unsatisfying. Similarly, Joe Morgenstern described Guy in a review for The Wall Street Journal as \\"downright vile, a self-created pariah, and funny enough for a reasonable stretch of time\\" before the plot becomes \\"both implausible and banal\\". The Globe and Mail Robert Everett-Green gave Bad Words 1 out of 4 stars, deeming it \\"a shallow remix\\" of offensive and clichéd characters with poor acting and \\"mean-spirited\\" humor.

History Foliejon was originally known as Belestre, a hunting lodge granted by King Edward I to John Drokensford, Bishop of Bath and Wells, later co-regent for his son, Edward II. He changed the name of his Berkshire residence to 'Folies Johan', which in Anglo-Saxon means 'owned by John'. It is mentioned in the 'Rotulorum Originalium Abbreviatio' that \\"the palaces of Hyremere and Belestre, commonly called folye Johan were taken by the King in 1313 as payment for debts of the bishop and assigned in 1317 to Oliver de Bordeaux for the rent of a red rose with license to surround the estate of Foly Johan and make it a park\\". The property was inherited by Olivier de Bordeaux's step-son, William Trussell. However, Edward III, wanting to unify Foliejon with Windsor Great Park, forcibly exchanged it for the manor of Eaton Hastings in the Vale of White Horse in 1359. Side view Foliejon continued as a Royal estate for the next three centuries, until sold to Serjeant Henne in 1630, who was invested with a baronetcy in 1642. The property was inherited by his son, Henry, in 1667, grandson, Henry, in 1675, great-grandson, Richard, in 1705, and the co- heiresses, Penelope and Alice, in 1710. In 1735, Penelope sold her share to a Mr. Bennett. Lord Henry Beauclerk bought out Mr. Bennet in 1744 and Alice in 1748. In 1771, Foliejon was sold to George Phillips Towry, who sold it to Thomas Bingley in 1800, who, in turn, sold it to William Blane William Blane was a brother of Sir Gilbert Blane, one of whose 3 daughters accidentally drowned in a pond on William Blane's estate. in 1802. William left his estates to Thomas Law Blane,William Blane of Foliejon Park, geni.com who, in turn, left them to his nephew, Captain Gordon Gilbert Blane, in 1885. During the German occupation of Norway in World War II, the King, Haakon VII, and his son Olav, resided at Foliejon Park from March 1942 to June 1945. During this period, the property was also the seat of the Norwegian government in exile. In 1957, the property was bought by Gerald T. Hodge as a conference centre for the company Mining and Chemical Products Ltd. At that time it was the avenue of poplars planted in front of the residence, with seeds brought from his world travels.

The film is historical fiction that follows two sisters who are caught up in the outbreak of the Nigerian Civil War. It stars Chiwetel Ejiofor, Thandie Newton, Onyeka Onwenu, Anika Noni Rose, Joseph Mawle, Genevieve Nnaji, OC Ukeje and John Boyega. The film premiered in the Special Presentation section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot Half of a Yellow Sun begins during the first Nigerian Independence Day on 1 October 1960 and concludes at the end of the Nigerian Civil War in 1970. The film is interspersed with archival stock footage of television news broadcasts of political events in Nigeria. After completing their university education in the United Kingdom and United States, twin sisters Olanna (Thandie Newton) and Kainene (Anika Noni Rose) return to Nigeria. Their father is the Igbo Chief Ozobia (Zack Orji), a wealthy businessman who owns assets in Port Harcourt. Spurning an offer to marry Finance Minister Festus Okotie-Eboh, Olanna decides to move in with her lover, the \\"revolutionary professor\\" Odenigbo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), who teaches at the university in the Nigerian city of Nsukka. Meanwhile, Kainene takes over the family interests and pursues a career as a businesswoman, falling in love with Richard Churchill (Joseph Mawle), an English writer. At Nsukka University, Olanna finds work as a sociology lecturer and befriends Odenigbo's houseboy Ugwu (John Boyega). However, Olanna faces hostility from Odenigbo's mother \\"Mama\\" (Onyeka Onwenu), who distrusts the highly educated Olanna and considers her a witch. Disapproving of her son's relationship with Olanna, \\"Mama\\" plies Odenigbo with alcohol and arranges for her servant Amala (Susan Wokoma) to have a one-night stand with him. A devastated Olanna wants to break off the relationship but her Aunt Ifeka (Gloria Young) convinces her to return to Nsukka. Despite having a one- night stand with Richard, Olanna and Odenigbo reconcile and agree to raise Amala's infant daughter as their own child. The child is named Chiamaka but they call her \\"Baby.\\" After falling out with Kainene, Richard returns to London. While waiting at the airport, he witnesses Northern Nigerian soldiers slaughtering Igbo civilians in the build-up to the Nigerian Civil War. Meanwhile, Olanna is caught up in a race riot and barely escapes with her life. As ethnic tensions build up, Olanna and her family flee Kano and resettle in Abba in Biafra. After reconciling with \\"Mama\\", Olanna decides to remain in Nigeria and marry Odenigbo. While Biafra declares independence, Richard returns from London to work with his lover Kainene, who has become a war profiteer importing arms to Biafra. The fighting forces Olanna and her family to evacuate to Umuahia. During the wedding reception, Olanna and her family narrowly escape a Nigerian bombing raid. As the civil war drags on, Olanna and her family relocate to a refugee camp where she reunites with her sister Kainene, who has experienced a change of heart and helps to run the refugee camp. Ugwu is later conscripted as a Biafran child soldier. As time passes by, Olanna and Odenigbo befriend Kainene and Richard. With the refugee camp running low on supplies due to the civil war, Kainene decides to travel into Nigerian territory in order to trade with local peasants despite Odenigbo's warnings. Several days pass by and Kainene fails to return. While Olanna and Richard fail to find Kainene, they are relieved to learn that Ugwu has survived the war and welcome him back to the family. Following the defeat of Biafra, Richard continues his search for Kainene while Olanna, Odenigbo, Ugwu, and \\"Baby\\" rebuild their lives. The post-script mentions that Kainene was never found while Richard moved back to Nsukka. Olanna and Odenigbo remained married for nearly fifty years while Ugwu became a writer. Their daughter Chiamaka (aka \\"Baby\\") becomes a medical doctor.

Bandele lists malaria and typhoid as one of the major challenges of the shoot, with several members of the cast and crew becoming ill, including star Thandie Newton. Adaptation Adichie was happy about the final product of the film as she thought it was beautiful and very well done. She also said the acting is very good and she loved the fact that it was filmed in Nigeria, which was her only requirement. Music inspired by the film In February 2014, it was announced that D'banj would release a track titled \\"Bother You\\", a song inspired by the film, to coincide with the release of the film. D'banj was inspired to record \\"Bother You\\" after watching the film. The music video for the song includes images from the film. Critical reception Half of a Yellow Sun received mixed reception from critics. It currently has a 51% aggregate rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 53 reviews, with a 5.53 out of 10 average score. The site's consensus states \\"While it doesn't quite do justice to the source material, Half of a Yellow Sun adapts Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's novel with committed performances and narrative nuance\\". Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter writes that it \\"is the kind of ambitious literary adaptation that wants it all kinds of ways, not all of them compatible\\" and \\"the script is studded with great leaden lumps of expository dialogue\\". Nollywood Reinvented says the film is nowhere as good as the book, but points out that \\"Even though the movie does not recreate the emotions of the book it creates its own emotions\\". It also says \\"The movie builds on amazing sets, actors, supporting actors and music\\", but the characters lack depth. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave a 2 out of 5 stars and also commented that \\"there is a heartfelt quality\\" but \\"unfortunately, the film is often stately and sluggish with some very daytime-soapy moments of emotional revelation. At other times, it looks more like a filmed theatrical piece\\".

History The coming of the Northern Pacific Railway to Missoula ensured the town's economic prosperity as a major transportation hub in Western Montana.McDonald, Babcock 1984, p. 6. The first depot in Missoula was constructed in 1883 and was located approximately west of the current structure. This depot was planned to be replaced in 1896, but the replacement depot was destroyed by arson before it was completed. The current depot, which was completed in 1901, was designed by architects Reed and Stem of St. Paul, Minnesota, in a simplified Renaissance Revival style of architecture. Reed and Stem designed over 100 railroad depots, including the Grand Central Terminal in New York City.Missoula Downtown AssociationBelle 2000, p. 52. The depot is constructed of beige roman brick that had been salvaged by Northern Pacific from the railroad's abandoned Olympian Hotel project in Tacoma, Washington, that would later be rebuilt as Stadium High School. Bricks from that hotel would also be used to construct a depot at Wallace, Idaho the same year. The Missoula depot features a main three-story structure flanked by one story wings on each side. The main structure is divided by brick columns into six bays, with the outer four columns on each side sporting the Northern Pacific black and red yin-yang logo. The wings are likewise divided into four bays. The main structure has a hipped roof with terra cotta tiles, while the wings feature flat roofs.McDonald, Babcock 1984, p. 2.

In 1846, he was declared bankrupt, and decided to emigrate in 1849, but died a few days after arriving in Adelaide, South Australia.  Early years  James Bonnin's birth and baptism records have not been found, but he was probably born between 1775 and 1782 in or around London. His parents were James Bonnin and his wife Susanna (formerly Brown) who were married in St Marylebone in 1770. Little is known of his early life, but it his clear that he was of French Huguenot extraction, as many of his siblings were baptised in French churches in and around the city of London.  Career  Bonnin has been described as \\"the builder who more effectively than another left his stamp on present-day Brompton.\\"'The Alexander Estate', Survey of London: volume 41: Brompton (1983), pp. 58-86. http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50009 Around 1806, he was involved in a number of developments in the Hans Town area. Bonnin was then describing himself as a carpenter and undertaker. In 1815, the London Gazette reports a James Bonnin - builder, carpenter, dealer and chapman - of North Street, Kensington being declared bankrupt.London Gazette: 16 September 1815 However he seems to have recovered rapidly from this setback: in a trade directory for 1816-17 he is listed as a timber merchant with an address in Sloane Place. About 1819-20 Bonnin was involved in building in Knightsbridge (including Trevor Square), and in 1821 he undertook the initial development of Brompton Square. His subsequent work was divided between for the Alexander Estate (starting in 1826) and Smith's Charity, which owned substantial areas of land in the Brompton area. His first contract for the charity started in 1822.Greater London Council Survey of London: Volume 41 - Brompton (1983) http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50011 He built a terrace of eight houses for the charity, (Onslow Terrace: later demolished to make way for the underground railway), on what is now the western end of Brompton Road. Bonnin worked with a surveyor appointed by the charity, whose job was to handle the details of contracts and approve designs for the buildings. In 1828 George Basevi, an architect who was a cousin of Benjamin Disraeli, was appointed surveyor. Bonnin was a meticulous builder who produced high quality buildings and from then on, Basevi designed the houses and Bonnin built them. Between 1833 and 1844 they built Pelham Crescent, Pelham Place, part of Pelham Street and a small area of Fulham Road on either side of the Pelham Street junction. Alongside the building, Bonnin had another venture. In 1802, his sister Susanna had married Samuel Cocks, a master pewterer in the City of London. At some point - probably after Samuel's death in 1820, Bonnin went into partnership with Susanna, who kept the Cocks pewter touch markPewterbank: Marks on Pewter Plates http://pewterbank.com/html/plate_marks_-_rims.html producing until 1844. Bonnin was admitted to the Freedom of the City of London London, England, Freedom of the City Admission Papers http://search.ancestry.co.uk/search/db.aspx?dbid=2052 as a Master Pewterer in 1836. His partnership with his sister was dissolved in 1838. By 1843, Bonnin and his second son, also James Bonnin, were splitting further work on the estate between them. James junior was appointed to construct 6-10 (even) Pelham Street and some houses on the north side of Pelham Street which were eventually demolished to make way for the South Kensington station. Bonnin secured a much bigger project on the site of Brompton Grange, which was to result in the construction of Egerton Crescent, Egerton Terrace, Yeoman's Row and Crescent Place by 1849. Bonnin may only have been directly involved in the construction of Egerton Crescent and probably sub-contracted the rest of the work. To finance these various developments, the Bonnins entered into arrangements with lenders and with other speculators. It is known, for example, that Bonnin borrowed £2,000 from a wine merchant in Pelham Crescent, on the security of his underlease of Nos. 50-53 Egerton Crescent. Bonnin's partnership with architect George Basevi ended in 1845 when Basevi fell from one of the towers of Ely Cathedral and was killed.  Personal life  In 1805 Bonnin married Elizabeth Moye, who subsequently bore him a large family. Elizabeth died in 1835, and Bonnin married Mary Ann Aldridge in 1838 and had five more children. Following Basevi's death, Bonnin fell on hard times and in July 1846 he was again declared bankrupt. He explained his financial difficulties as being due to 'undertaking more than my means would justify, ... the fluctuations in the funds in 1845 and 1846, and fall in House property with some heavy losses'. There was a depression in the Kensington housing market about this time which may have caught him over-exposed financially. Four of his sons from his first marriage had emigrated to South Australia and in 1849, faced with the prospect of the workhouse, he decided to join them. He managed to persuade the Kensington Board of Guardians to give him £10 so that he and his young family could emigrate to South Australia and start a new life.Passenger list for the \\"Asiatic\\": London - Adelaide 1849 http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/fh/passengerlists/1849Asiatic.htm Bonnin, however, died in January 1850, only a few days after his arrival in Adelaide.

Set in Poland in 1962, it follows a young woman on the verge of taking vows as a Catholic nun. Orphaned as an infant during the German occupation of World War II, she must meet her aunt, a former Communist state prosecutor and only surviving relative, who tells her that her parents were Jewish. The two women embark on a road trip into the Polish countryside to learn the fate of their family. Called a \\"compact masterpiece\\" and an \\"eerily beautiful road movie\\", the film has also been said to \\"contain a cosmos of guilt, violence and pain\\", even if certain historical events (German occupation of Poland, the Holocaust and Stalinism) remain unsaid: \\"none of this is stated, but all of it is built, so to speak, into the atmosphere: the country feels dead, the population sparse\\". Ida won the 2015 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, becoming the first Polish film to do so. It had earlier been selected as Best Film of 2014 by the European Film Academy and as Best Film Not in the English Language of 2014 by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA). In 2016, the film was named as the 55th best film of the 21st century, from a poll of 177 film critics from around the world. Plot In the 1960s Polish People's Republic, Anna, a young novice nun, is told by her prioress that before she takes her vows she must visit her aunt, Wanda Gruz, who is her only surviving relative. Anna travels to visit her aunt Wanda, a chain-smoking, hard-drinking, sexually promiscuous judge who reveals that Anna's actual name is Ida Lebenstein; Ida's parents had been Jews who were murdered late in the German occupation of Poland during World War II (1939–45). Ida was then an infant, and as an orphan she had been raised by the convent. Wanda, who had been a Communist resistance fighter against the German occupation, became the state prosecutor \\"Red Wanda\\"\\"Red Wanda\\" is the English subtitle translation of the Polish \\"Krwawa Wanda\\". The literal translation is \\"Bloody Wanda\\"; see who sent \\"men to their deaths\\". Wanda tells Ida that she should try some worldly sins and pleasures before she decides to take her vows. On their way to their hotel for the night, Wanda picks up a hitchhiker, Lis (Polish for \\"fox\\"), who turns out to be an alto saxophone player who is going to a gig in the same town. Wanda tries to get Ida interested in Lis, and to come to his show, but she resists until going down after hours to watch the band wrapping up their evening with a song after the crowd has left. Lis is drawn to Ida and talks with her before she leaves for the night to rejoin her aunt who is passed out in their room. Ida wants to see the graves of her parents, Róża and Haim Lebenstein, and Wanda reveals that it is not known where, or if, they were buried. Wanda asks her what would happen if she goes to where their bodies are and discovers that God is not there. Wanda takes her to the house they were born in and used to own, which is now occupied by a Pole, Feliks Skiba, and his family. During the war, the Skibas had taken over the home and land, and hidden the Lebensteins from the German authorities. Wanda demands that Feliks tell her where his father is so that he can tell her what happened to her family. After some searching, Wanda and Ida find him close to death in a hospital, where he remembers Róża and speaks well of the Lebensteins, but says little else. Wanda reveals to Ida that she had left her son with Róża and Haim while she went to fight in the Polish Resistance, and that he presumably died alongside them, robbing her of the opportunity of getting to know him. Feliks does not want his father to die feeling guilty of murder, and asks them to keep his father out of their search. Instead, he agrees to tell them where the bodies are buried if Ida promises that they will leave the Skibas alone and give up any claim to the house and land. Feliks takes the women to the burial place in the woods and digs up the bones of their family. He admits to Ida that he took the three into the woods and killed them. Feliks says that because Ida was very small and able to pass for a Christian, he was able to give her to a convent. But Wanda's small son was \\"dark and circumcised\\", and, as he couldn't pass for a Christian child, Feliks had killed him along with Ida's parents. Wanda and Ida take the bones to their family burial plot, in an abandoned, overgrown Jewish cemetery in Lublin, and bury them. Wanda and Ida then part ways and return to their previous existences and routines, but they both have been profoundly affected by their experience. Although Wanda continues to drink and engage in apparently meaningless casual sex, she is also now mourning not only the loss of her son and sister, but now also her niece. Ida returns to the convent but is visibly unenthusiastic about her life there, and informs the prioress she is not ready to take her solemn vows. Wanda's melancholy deepens and she ultimately jumps to her death out of her apartment window. Ida returns to attend Wanda's funeral, where she sees Lis again. At Wanda's apartment, Ida changes out of her nun's habit and into Wanda's stilettos and evening gown, tries smoking and drinking, and then goes to Lis' gig, where he later teaches her to dance. After the show Ida and Lis sleep together. Lis suggests they get married, have children, and after that, live \\"life as usual.\\" The next morning, Ida quietly arises without awakening Lis, dons her convent habit again and leaves.

The director of Ida, Paweł Pawlikowski, was born in Poland and lived his first fourteen years there. In 1971 his mother abruptly emigrated with him to England, where he ultimately became a prominent filmmaker. Ida is his first Polish film; in an interview he said that the film \\"is an attempt to recover the Poland of my childhood, among many things\\". Ida was filmed in Poland with a cast and crew that was drawn primarily from the Polish film industry. The film received crucial early funding from the Polish Film Institute based on a screenplay by Pawlikowski and Rebecca Lenkiewicz, who is an English playwright. Once the support from the Polish Film Institute had been secured, producer Eric Abraham underwrote production of the film. The first version of the screenplay was written in English by Lenkiewicz and Pawlikowski, when it had the working title Sister of Mercy. Pawlikowski then translated the screenplay into Polish and further adapted it for filming. The character of Wanda Gruz is based on Helena Wolińska-Brus, although Wanda's life and fate differ significantly from the real-life model. Like the character, Wolińska-Brus was a Jewish Pole who survived World War II as a member of the Communist resistance. In the postwar Communist regime she was a military prosecutor who was involved in show trials. One notorious example of these led to the 1953 execution of General 'Nil' Fieldorf, a famed resistance fighter. While Wolińska-Brus may have been involved, she was not the actual prosecutor for that trial. Pawlikowski met her in the 1980s in England, where she'd emigrated in 1971; he's said of her that \\"I couldn't square the warm, ironic woman I knew with the ruthless fanatic and Stalinist hangman. This paradox has haunted me for years. I even tried to write a film about her, but couldnʼt get my head around or into someone so contradictory.\\" Pawlikowski had difficulty in casting the role of Anna/Ida. After he'd interviewed more than 400 actresses, Agata Trzebuchowska was discovered by a friend of Pawlikowski's, who saw her sitting in a cafe in Warsaw reading a book. She had no acting experience or plans to pursue an acting career. She agreed to meet with Pawlikowski because she was a fan of his film My Summer of Love (2004). Łukasz Żal and Ryszard Lenczewski are credited as the cinematographers. Lenczewski has been the cinematographer for Pawlikowski's feature films since Last Resort (2000); unlike Pawlikowski, Lenczewski had worked in Poland as well as England prior to Ida. Ida is filmed in black and white, and uses the now uncommon 4:3 ratio of the horizontal and vertical sizes of the image. When Pawlikowski told the film's producers of these decisions about filming, they reportedly commented, \\"Paul, you are no longer a student, don't be silly.\\" Lenczewski has commented that, \\"We chose black and white and the 1.33 frame because it was evocative of Polish films of that era, the early 1960s. We designed the unusual compositions to make the audience feel uncertain, to watch in a different way.\\" The original plan had been for Żal to assist Lenczewski. Lenczewski became ill, and Żal took over the project. Production on Ida was interrupted mid-filming by an early snowstorm. Pawlikowski took advantage of the two-week hiatus to refine the script, find new locations, and rehearse. He credits the break for \\"making the film cohere ... in a certain, particular way.\\" Ida was edited by Jarosław Kamiński, a veteran of Polish cinema. Pawlikowski's previous English language feature films were edited by David Charap. Except the final scene of the film, there is no background musical score; as Dana Stevens explains, \\"the soundtrack contains no extradiegetic music—that is, music the characters aren't listening to themselves—but all the music that's there is significant and carefully chosen, from Wanda's treasured collection of classical LPs to the tinny Polish pop that plays on the car radio as the women drive toward their grim destination.\\" As for the final scene, Pawlikowski has said, \\"The only piece of music that is non-ambient (from outside the world of the film – that is not on the radio or played by a band) is the piece of Bach at the end. I was a bit desperate with the final scene, and I tried it out in the mix. It's in a minor key, but it seems serene and to recognize the world and its complexities.\\" Critical reception Ida received widespread acclaim, with critics praising its writing and cinematography. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 96% approval rating, based on 162 reviews, with an average rating of 8.36/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Empathetically written, splendidly acted, and beautifully photographed, Ida finds director Pawel Pawlikowski revisiting his roots to powerful effect.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 91 out of 100, based on 35 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim.\\" A. O. Scott of the New York Times writes that \\"with breathtaking concision and clarity—80 minutes of austere, carefully framed black and white—Mr. Pawlikowski penetrates the darkest, thorniest thickets of Polish history, reckoning with the crimes of Stalinism and the Holocaust.\\" He concludes that \\"Mr. Pawlikowski has made one of the finest European films (and one of the most insightful films about Europe, past and present) in recent memory.\\" David Denby of The New Yorker has called Ida a \\"compact masterpiece\\", and he discusses the film's reticence concerning the history in which it is embedded: \\"Between 1939 and 1945, Poland lost a fifth of its population, including three million Jews. In the two years after the war, Communists took over the government under the eyes of the Red Army and the Soviet secret police, the N.K.V.D.. Many Poles who were prominent in resisting the Nazis were accused of preposterous crimes; the independent- minded were shot or hanged. In the movie, none of this is stated, but all of it is built, so to speak, into the atmosphere ...\\" Denby considered Ida to be \\"by far the best movie of the year\\". Peter Debruge was more reserved about the film's success, writing in Variety that \\"...dialing things back as much as this film does risks losing the vast majority of viewers along the way, offering an intellectual exercise in lieu of an emotional experience to all but the most rarefied cineastes.\\" Ida is partially a \\"road movie\\" in which the relationship of its two main characters, Anna/Ida (Agata Trzebuchowska) and Wanda (Agata Kulesza), develops as they journey into Poland's hinterlands and into their shared history. Both actresses have received favorable reviews for their performances from several critics. Peter Bradshaw wrote in The Guardian that \\"Agata Trzebuchowska is tremendously mysterious as a 17-year-old novitiate in a remote convent: she has the impassivity and inscrutability of youth.\\" Riva Reardon writes, \\"In her debut role, the actress masterfully negotiates the film's challenging subtlety, offering glimpses into her character with only a slight movement of the corner of her mouth or by simply shifting her uncanny black eyes.\\" David Denby writes that \\"Wanda tells her of her past in brief fragments, and Kulesza does more with those fragments—adding a gesture, a pause—than anyone since Greta Garbo, who always implied much more than she said.\\" Dana Stevens writes that \\"As played, stupendously, by the veteran Polish TV, stage, and film actress Agata Kulesza, Wanda is a vortex of a character, as fascinating to spend time with as she is bottomlessly sad.\\" =Controversy and criticism= The film was criticized by Polish nationalists for its perspective on Christian–Jewish relations in Poland. A letter of complaint was sent by the right-wing Polish Anti-Defamation League to the Polish Film Institute, which provided significant funding for the film. A petition calling for the addition of explanatory title cards was signed by more than 40,000 Poles; the film does not explicitly note that thousands of Poles were executed by the German occupiers for hiding or helping Jewish Poles. Eric Abraham, one of the producers of Ida, responded \\"Are they really suggesting that all films loosely based on historical events should come with contextual captions? Tell that to Mr. Stone and Mr. Spielberg and Mr. von Donnersmarck,\\" which refers to the directors of JFK, Lincoln, and The Lives of Others. Conversely, others have argued that the character of Wanda Gruz, who participated in the persecution of those who threatened the Soviet-sponsored postwar regime, perpetuates a stereotype about Polish Jews as collaborators with the regime. =Influences= Several critics have discerned possible influences on Ida from Carl Theodor Dreyer's films and from Robert Bresson's. Thus David Thomson writes enthusiastically that seeing Ida is \\"like seeing Carl Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc for the first time\\" and that the relationship of Ida and her aunt Wanda is \\"worthy of the Bresson of Diary of a Country Priest.\\" The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928) is a silent film that is noted as one of the greatest films. M. Leary has expanded on the influence on Ida: \\"The actress that plays Ida was apparently noticed at a cafe and drafted in as a blank canvas for this character, who becomes a mute witness in the film to the terror of Jewish genocide and the Soviet aftermath. She is a bit like Dreyer's Joan in that her character is more about a violent march of history than her Catholic subtext.\\" Dana Stevens writes that Ida is \\"set in the early 1960s, and its stylistic austerity and interest in theological questions often recall the work of Robert Bresson (though Pawlikowski lacks—I think—Bresson's deeply held faith in salvation).\\" Other critics have emphasized stylistic similarities to New Wave films such as the definitive French film The 400 Blows (directed by François Truffaut-1959) and the Polish film Innocent Sorcerers (directed by Andrzej Wajda-1960). There are also similarities with Luis Buñuel's Viridiana (1961). Box office Grossing more than $3.8 million at the North American box office, the film has been described as a \\"crossover hit\\", especially for a foreign language film. Nearly 500,000 people watched the film in France, making it one of the most successful Polish-language films ever screened there. The film earned nearly as much in France, $3.2 million, as it did in the US. The film earned $0.3 million in Poland, and less than $0.1 million in Germany. Accolades Ida was screened in the Special Presentation section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival where it won the FIPRESCI Special Presentations award. Among other festivals Ida won Best Film at Gdynia, Warsaw, London, Bydgoszcz, Minsk, Gijón, Wiesbaden, Kraków. The film is also widely recognized for Agata Kulesza's and Agata Trzebuchowska's performances, and for the cinematography by Ryszard Lenczewski and Łukasz Żal. The film was honoured by the national Polish Film Academy as the Best Film of 2013, winning in three other categories, and nominated in seven additional categories. The European Film Academy nominated the film in seven categories, winning 5, including Best European Film and People's Choice Award, at the 27th European Film Awards. The Spanish Academy of Arts and Cinematographic Sciences named Ida as Best European Film at the 29th Goya Awards. At the 68th British Academy Film Awards the film won the Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. At the 87th Academy Awards it won the award for Best Foreign Language Film, and was also nominated for Best Cinematography.

The daughter of a small farmer, she was raised as a \\"Strict Baptist\\" but de-converted back to atheism. She became a salaried speaker for the secularist movement and addressed many often hostile audiences around the country. She was invited to sit on the general council of the First International, the only woman to do so, where she engaged in debate with prominent communists including Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. From 1877 to 1878 she published The Secular Chronicle, which covered subjects such as socialism, atheism and women's rights. Early years Harriet Teresa Frost was born in Ongar on 5 November 1831. She was brought up as a Strict Baptist. Her father was a small farmer, but when his business failed he moved with his family to London's East End. Law taught in a Sunday school to bring some income to the family. In the 1850s she began debating with Owenite infidels such as George Holyoake and Charles Southwell who were giving lectures in East London. In the process she lost her religious beliefs. She \\"saw the light of reason\\" in 1855 and became a strong supporter of Holyoake. She embraced atheism, feminism, and \\"Owenite co-operation\\" after these discussions. Harriet married Edward Law on 11 January 1855. They lived at 38 Boyson Road in Walworth and had four children. Her husband was also a free thinker. Public figure =Secularist speaker= From 1859 Harriet Law was paid a salary for lecturing for the secular movement. She spoke out against Christianity at meetings around the country in the 1860s and 1870s. Often it was difficult to find premises that could be hired for such meetings, and often the audience was hostile and at times even violent. When giving a series of lectures in Keighley, Yorkshire, in September 1866 she had to compete with Henry Grattan Guinness, of the brewing family, a nonconformist evangelist who held meetings at the same time to try to counteract her influence. Writing in 1893, Annie Besant said of her, \\"Mrs. Harriet Law, a woman of much courage and of strong natural ability, had many a rough meeting in her lecturing days.\\" Mainstream feminist groups excluded Law due to her Marxist and atheist beliefs. Other opponents dismissed Law's views as worthless since she was from the lower classes, poorly educated and a woman. A member of the Bible Defence Association said he \\"could not debate in the streets with a woman, and especially one of Mrs Law's class.\\" A lecture that Law gave in Woolwich on \\"How I became a freethinker and why I remain one\\" was attacked in the press as \\"the infidel lecture.\\" Some of the lectures Law gave at Cleveland Hall in Fitzroy Square in London in the 1860s were titled \\"The Teachings and Philosophy of J.S. Mill, Esq.\\", \\"The Late Robert Owen: a Tribute to His Memory\\" and \\"Appeal to Women to Consider their Interests in Connexion with the Social, Political, and Theological Aspects of the Times.\\" In June 1867 she shared the stage at a suffrage meeting in Cleveland Hall with the American physician and woman's rights activist Mary Edwards Walker. Law talked of John Stuart Mill's proposal for Woman's suffrage, which was being debated by the House of Commons, while Walker spoke of reform to the marriage laws. In 1876 Law was engaged by the Lancashire Secular Union to give ten special lectures, each attended by about 5,000 people. On her lecture tours in the provinces Harriet Law did not represent the leadership of the movement, but served as a freelance speaker at the meetings of the local secularist societies. Although prominent in the movement, Law did not join the leadership of the National Secular Society (NSS). This may have been due to difficulty working with its leader, Charles Bradlaugh. At the 1866 NSS conference in Leeds she backed George William Foote in his attempt to oust Bradlaugh, which did not succeed. Soon after, Foote was expelled from the NSS. She was offered a vice-presidency of the NSS in 1867 and again in 1876, but refused both times. In the mid-1870s Annie Besant threatened to eclipse Law as the leading woman free thought lecturer. A biographer of Bradlaugh said \\"Mrs Besant had come on the scene, and there was not room for two ladies as Secularist advocates.\\" Law fell out with Bradlaugh and Besant and left the NSS in 1877. George Holyoake, Charles Watts and Harriet Law then founded the British Secular Union, which remained active until 1884. =Communist leader= At first the International Workingmen's Association (IWA), now known as the First International, had mostly male membership, although in 1865 it was agreed that women could become members. The initial leadership was exclusively male. At the IWA General Council meeting on 16 April 1867 a letter from Harriet Law about Women's Rights was read, and it was agreed to ask her if she would be willing to attend council meetings. On 25 June 1867 she was admitted to the General Council, and for the next five years was the only woman representative. Mostly she remained silent, but she is recorded as intervening in a number of discussions. In 1868 Marx said that the \\"well-known orator Mrs. Harriet Law\\" represented the atheist popular movement in the General Council. It may have been due to her influence that Marx began to talk of Working Women as well as Working Men in declarations and addresses. Law did not attend the IWA General Council meetings between August 1870 and October 1871. In response to a question on her absence Friedrich Engels said she had told him she considered she was still a member. She was among the signatories on the 1872 brochure The Fictitious Splits in the International in which Marx and Engels opposed Mikhail Bakunin and his supporters. After leaving the General Council, Law was elected to represent the Central Society of Working Women of Geneva at the IWA's Hague Congress in 1872, but for some unexplained reason was unable to attend. The Internationalist women of Geneva were against the \\"family wage\\" concept that was being advocated in America by Marxists such as Friedrich Adolph Sorge, and wanted the IWA to demand clauses requiring \\"equal advantages\\" for women in labour agreements. =Last years= Harriet Law bought the Secular Chronicle after the founder, George Reddells, died of typhoid in October 1875. She was editor of the journal from 1876 to 1879, assisted by her daughter. She gave the paper a broader scope, with sections that covered atheism, women's rights, Owenite co-operation and republicanism. She published a short biography of Karl Marx, with a portrait, and in the next issue published an article by Marx in which he pointed out the errors in George Howell's History of the International. She published profiles of women such as the freethinker and women's rights activist Mary Wollstonecraft. In 1877 she published An Hour with Harriet Martineau. Law continued to speak in public. In July 1877 it was reported that she had engaged Cleveland Hall for another 12 months, and that she and others would talk on \\"The Recent Trial in Relation to Secularism.\\" On 29 July 1877 she was scheduled to speak in Manchester on \\"The Freethought of the Future, as Foreshadowed in the Writings of Moncure D. Conway.\\" However, illness forced her to cancel the talk. On 23 December 1877 she spoke in Glasgow, and a week later in Leeds. On 6 and 13 January 1878 she spoke in Newcastle-on-Tyne. Harriet Law handed the Secular Chronicle to new owners at the end on 1878. During her three years running the paper she had lost £1,000, a significant amount at the time. Law's health forced her to cut back her activities after 1879. However, she continued to speak at times. A hostile account of a meeting in 1880 was given in The Shield of faith, which called her a \\"secular lady lecturer\\". The writer said \\"A long course of Woman's Rights may have satisfied Mrs. Law that every married woman should rule her husband...\\" but pointed out that \\"In law the husband is held responsible for what his wife says; the law holds that the husband rules the wife.\\" On 6 March 1881 she spoke at the opening of Leicester Secular Society's new Secular Hall in Humberstone Gate, Leicester. The other speakers were George Jacob Holyoake, Annie Besant and Charles Bradlaugh. Harriet Law died of a heart attack on 19 July 1897, having been ill with bronchitis. At that time, she lived at 24 Somerville Road in Peckham. Beliefs On 27 August 1868 Law argued against Karl Marx, who opposed turning the IWA into what he called a \\"debating club\\". She was in favour of debates. On 28 July 1868 she again appeared to oppose Marx, praising the positive effect of factory automation in reducing the dependence of women on men. On education, she said that \\"The property of the Church must be secularised and devoted to schools. We want fewer parsons and more schoolmasters\\". Law was against imperialism during an era when many of the elite in Britain were proud of the continued expansion of the British Empire. She felt that a competitive economy did not let the worker get full value for his work. She was in favour of a communist system where a directing power distributed labour according to requirements. This was the only way to ensure the right to work and to obtain value for that work. Harriet Law has been called \\"a florid middle-aged farmer's daughter\\" who \\"had what some devotees of 'culchaw' do not possess—a great deal of natural ability. According to Bradlaugh she was \\"earnest, brusquely honest\\". William Stewart Ross said \\"She was a plain, blunt, honest woman, utterly free from all suspicion of humbug.\\" Eleanor Marx said she was one of the first women to recognise, \\"the importance of a woman's organisation from the proletarian point of view\\", and went on to say \\"When the history of the labour movement in England is written, the name of Harriet Law will be entered into the golden book of the proletariat.\\" References Notes Citations Sources   * A publication about birth control.

Cottage Inn provides a variety of pizza, perhaps most well known for their specialty gourmet pizzas, along with various crust styles and toppings.  History  = The Original Cottage Inn = The original Cottage Inn restaurant, opened in 1948, still stands in its original location at 512 East William, Ann Arbor. Although it started as a coffee shop, pizza was introduced in 1948. It has the distinction of being the first restaurant in Ann Arbor to serve pizza. The current owner acquired the building in 1961. The restaurant went through renovations in 1975, 1980, and 1987. In 1993, the restaurant expanded again to include a second floor and banquet room facilities. Due to its proximity to the University of Michigan campus, the original Cottage Inn is often frequented by students and visitors. The restaurant also has an established relationship with the Ann Arbor community, participating in community service events such as feeding the homeless on Thanksgiving. In early 2014, Cottage Inn announced a plan to expand nationally using a franchising business model. The company is accepting applications from potential franchisees through their franchising website. = Cottage Inn Carryout = By 1978, Cottage Inn's continued growth required the formation of a second company to devote to delivery services. As a result, Cottage Inn Carryout & Delivery, Inc. was established. The first Cottage Inn store under this new company was founded at Packard and Hill streets in Ann Arbor. In June 1986, the first franchise opened in Ypsilanti. In 2003, the new corporate headquarters and distribution center opened in Ann Arbor. In 2017, Cottage Inn opened a franchise location in China.  Sponsorships  In 2012, Cottage Inn partnered with the Michigan International Speedway to become the official pizza vendor on NASCAR weekends. Although the original plan was for Cottage Inn to provide 24-hour delivery service to customers in the campsites, logistical and staffing issues required the company to scale back its services.

The seat was vacated following the resignation of Lianne Dalziel of the Labour Party from parliament, who contested and won the Christchurch mayoralty in October 2013. The electorate is regarded as a safe Labour seat; the party has, apart from the 50-year gap when the electorate was abolished, held the electorate since the , although significant population changes since the 2011 Christchurch earthquake had made this allegiance to Labour less certain. Prior to the election, National's top party official in Canterbury had conceded that the by-election was \\"very, very hard for [National] to win\\". The by-election was won by Labour's Poto Williams, who prior to her selection as Labour's candidate was virtually unknown. Background  Following months of speculation, The Press reported on 20 April 2013 that Lianne Dalziel would challenge Bob Parker for the Christchurch mayoralty. On 19 June Dalziel formally confirmed that she would contest the mayoralty, also announcing that she would resign from Parliament, which would cause a by-election in the Christchurch East electorate. Dalziel's resignation took effect on 11 October, the day before the announcement of the mayoralty election-results. Candidates Ten candidates were nominated. =Poto Williams (Labour)= The Labour Party nominated Poto Williams for the by- election. In a surprise move, then Labour leader David Shearer appointed former MP Jim Anderton as the party's by-election campaign manager. Anderton, who was first elected to Parliament in for Labour in , left the party in 1989 over policy differences and, until his retirement as MP in 2011, led his own parties (the NewLabour Party and Jim Anderton's Progressive Party). The Labour Party nomination process started in August and Deon Swiggs was the first person to declare his candidacy. Swiggs, a 26-year-old who developed a profile following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, has been a Labour supporter since age 15. A day later, James Caygill confirmed his candidacy to represent the Labour Party. He is the son of former Minister of Finance David Caygill. The third person to join the Labour candidacy race was Tina Lomax, who is the principal of Kingslea School and who, from 2004 to 2010, was a Burwood-Pegasus Community Board member. Karen Hayes is a registered nurse and midwife, Christina Laalaai-Tausa is a PhD candidate at the University of Canterbury, and the sixth candidate was Poto Williams, the regional manager of St John of God Hauora Trust. Clayton Cosgrove, an existing list MP who had lost the electorate to National's Kate Wilkinson at the last election, had considered standing in the by-election, but in the end decided not to put his name forward for the Labour nomination. =Matthew Doocey (National)= The National Party nominated political newcomer Matthew Doocey for the by- election, who is a manager for the Canterbury District Health Board. The party's Canterbury Westland Regional Chair, Roger Bridge, noted that a sitting government has never won a by-election in an electorate that it did not already hold. Bridge later conceded that it would be \\"very, very hard for us to win\\". When Kate Wilkinson, National MP for the electorate, announced in early November 2013 that she would retire at the end of the term of the 50th Parliament, rumours immediately surfaced that Doocey would replace her as National's Waimakariri candidate, and the Christchurch East by-election would help him gain experience in contesting an election. Doocey is a member of the well-known Carter family. Family patriarch Maurice Carter, a Christchurch City Councillor for over 30 years (1956–1989), was his grandfather, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, David Carter, is his uncle. Doocey grew up in Christchurch and attended St Bede's College for his secondary schooling. The Dooceys bought their current home in Redwood, which currently falls into the Waimakariri electorate, in April 2011. =David Moorhouse (Green)= The Green Party nominated software developer David Moorhouse for the by-election. He stood for the party in Christchurch Central electorate at the 2011 general election. =Other candidates= ;ACT Party Gareth Veale was the candidate for the ACT Party. Veale is a 24-year-old earthquake claims specialist whose campaign is focusing on issues of crime and property rights. ;Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party Paula Lambert was the candidate for the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party. ;Conservative Party The Conservative Party nominated Leighton Baker, a future leader of the party. ;Democrats for Social Credit The Democrats for Social Credit nominated Jenner Lichtwark, a novelist. ;Independents Three people were contesting the by-election as independent candidates.

Style  It was during the 1980s that Loy developed the circular mandala combined with calligraphic hand- lettering that has become her style. The art columnist for The Roanoke Times dubbed Loy’s works a mix of “magic circles, calligraphy, and philosophical texts.” Loy told a reporter that she had adopted a “commercially refined style for the calligraphy.” In 2000, the coordinator of the Yankee Peddler Foundation in Medina, Ohio stated that, \\"Ms. Loy’s Literary Calligraphy demonstrates how type blossoms into art in a calligrapher’s hand.” Her style has also been described as, \\"poetry meets flowers, meets artistic script.\\" In 2008, Loy estimated that she had completed 150 modern mandalas.  Language of Flowers  Loy has completed numerous paintings and authored a book on the Language of Flowers. The March, 1994 edition of Victorian Sampler magazine featured Susan in an article entitled “The Language of Flowers.” Loy wrote an article for the Emily Dickinson International Society where she described her artistic process for painting a suite of Dickinson poems. In 2001 Susan Loy’s book on the Language of Flowers, Flowers the Angel’s Alphabet, was published. It won the 2002 Benjamin Franklin Award for the Gardening and Reference categories and was named Outstanding Book of the Year from the Independent Book Publishers Association. In 2008, Loy estimated that she had completed 150 modern mandalas. In 2018, Susan wrote a book chapter connecting the Victorian flower language to modern emojis.  White House Easter Egg Roll  A highlight of Loy’s career was her 3-year relationship with the White House Easter Egg Roll. In 1997, Loy was chosen as the Easter egg artist for the state of Virginia whose painted egg was displayed at the White House. Loy was chosen to serve as 1998 Artist-on-the-Lawn and to create the program cover for the 1998 White House Easter Egg Roll and to capture impressions of that event. As Artist on the Lawn, Loy painted “The White House Easter Egg Roll, 1878-1998” as the official poster for the 1999 event, and presented it to the President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton.  Constitution Project  Loy’s hand-lettering of the U.S. Constitution project began after the September 11 attacks in 2001 when she was stopped by the police of three separate occasions beginning in May 2002. She began her Constitution paintings with the preamble. Susan spoke to several school classes on Constitution Day, September 17, 2007. According to her web site, Loy spent over 2500 hours to complete the seven paintings that comprise her hand- lettered and illustrated U.S. Constitution. She also completed paintings of the Declaration of Independence and The Gettysburg Address to complement the Constitution Project.  American Arts and Crafts Festival Artist  Susan Loy began exhibiting her art at outdoor art festivals in the early 1980s at her local “Art in the Alley” in Bedford, Virginia. She founded Literary Calligraphy in 1983, and was joined by her husband in 1990. Together, they increased their number of shows and festivals, expanded the company and built a shop to accommodate cutting custom mats, picture framing, and selling reproductions and stationery. In 2003, Literary Calligraphy estimates that it sold 3,000 reproductions per year, had a mailing list of 35,000 and employed up to seven full- and part-time persons. According to their web site, Loy and her company traveled widely to art festivals in the eastern United States including (for example) Ann Arbor Art Fairs (Ann Arbor, Michigan), St. James Court Art Show (Louisville, Kentucky) and Three Rivers Art Festival (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). In addition, they sold at crafts shows , flower shows including the Philadelphia Flower Show (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) and the Northwest Flower and Garden Show (Seattle, Washington), as well as at selected conventions, including the American Library Association and the National Council of Teachers of English.  In the Czech Republic In the autumn of 2017, Susan and her husband announced that they were leaving the American arts and craft show circuit, closing their custom framing operations, and moving to Prague in the Czech Republic. Loy explained that, “I had a junior year abroad in Luxembourg and always wanted to return and live in Europe, but the lifestyle and rewards of a touring artist kept me in Virginia.” She chose Prague because it is a “world-class city and affordable.” They continue to sell reproductions and stationery in the United States at amazon.com Loy was granted a 2-year cultural visa, sponsored by the Czech Unitarian Church to commemorate the Flower Communion introduced by Norbert Čapek in 1923. On June 14, 2020 Loy unveiled a watercolor painting, titled Czech Flower Alphabet, so detailed that it took her two years to complete. Loy presented the painting at the annual Flower Communion in Čapek Hall in the Unitaria on Anenská in Prague 1. A video recorded an interview of Susan Loy in her Prague studio, conducted by art historian, Jana Ticha. The interview covers Loy’s connection to Čapek’s Flower Celebration, the research that she conducted in order to plan the watercolor painting, and the technique she used to create the painting.

Analogous to the classical boxplot and considered an expansion of the concepts defining functional boxplot, the descriptive statistics of a contour boxplot are: the envelope of the 50% central region, the median curve and the maximum non-outlying envelope. To construct a contour boxplot, data ordering is the first step. In functional data analysis, each observation is a real function, therefore data ordering is different from the classical boxplot where scalar data are simply ordered from the smallest sample value to the largest. More generally, data depth, gives a center- outward ordering of data points, and thereby provides a mechanism for constructing rank statistics of various kinds of multidimensional data. For instance, functional data examples can be ordered using the method of band depth or a modified band depth. In contour data analysis, each observation is a feature-set (a subset of the domain), and therefore not a function. Thus, the notion of band depth and modified band depth is further extended to accommodate features that can be expressed as sets but not necessarily as functions. Contour band depth allows for ordering feature-set data from the center outwards and, thus, introduces a measure to define functional quantiles and the centrality or outlyingness of an observation. Having the ranks of feature-set data, the contour boxplot is a natural extension of the classical boxplot which in special cases reduces back to the traditional functional boxplot.  Set/contour band depth  Set band depth (introduced in ), denoted as sBD, is a method for establishing a center-outward ordering of a collection of sets. As with other band depth, data ordering methods, set band depth, computes the probability of whether a sample lies in the band formed by j other samples from the distribution. We say that a set S ∈ E is an element of the band of a collection of j other sets S1, ..., Sj ∈ E if it is bounded by their union and intersection. That is: : S\\\\in sB(S_1,\\\\ldots,S_j) \\\\Longleftrightarrow \\\\bigcap_{k=1}^j S_k \\\\subset S\\\\subset \\\\bigcup_{k=1}^j S_k. \\\\, The set band depth is the sum of probabilities of lying in bands formed by different numbers of samples (2, ..., J). : sBD_J(S)=\\\\sum_{j=2}^JP\\\\left[S\\\\in sB(S_1,\\\\ldots,S_j\\\\right]. Set band depth is shown to be a generalization of function band depth. Set band depth has a modified form that is derived from a relaxed form of subset, which requires only a percentage of a set to be included in another. Contour band depth (cBD) is a direct application of sBD, where the sets are derived from thresholded input functions, F(x) > q. In this way, an ensemble of scalar input functions and a threshold value, gives rise to a collection of contours, and sorting cBD gives a data-depth ordering (highest-to-lowest probability gives greatest-to-smallest depth) of those contours. By relying on the set formulation, contour boxplots avoid any explicit correspondence of points on different contours.  Contour boxplot construction  In the classical boxplot, the box itself represents the middle 50% of the data. Since the data ordering in the contour boxplot is from the center outwards, the 50% central region is defined by the band delimited by the 50% of deepest, or the most central observations. The border of the 50% central region is defined as the envelope representing the box in a classical boxplot. Thus, this 50% central region is the analog to the interquartile range (IQR) and gives a useful indication of the spread of the central 50% of the curves. This is a robust range for interpretation because the 50% central region is not affected by outliers or extreme values, and gives a less biased visualization of the curves' spread. The observation in the box indicates the median, or the most central observation which is also a robust statistic to measure centrality. The \\"whiskers\\" of the boxplot are the vertical lines of the plot extending from the box and indicating the maximum envelope of the dataset except the outliers. In contour boxplots, this is formed by considering the difference of the union and intersection formed by all non- outlying samples. Outliers are determined as having a cBD value that is less than some multiplier (less than one) times the cBD of the 50% ranked samples.  Examples  The following example is an ensemble of data from 2D incompressible Navier–Stokes simulation consisting of 40 members, where each ensemble member is a simulation with Reynolds number and inlet velocity chosen randomly. The inlet velocity values are randomly drawn from a normal distribution with mean value of 1 and standard deviation of ±0.01 (in non- dimensionalized units); likewise, Reynolds numbers are generated from a normal distribution with mean value of 130 and standard deviation of ±3. The example below is from an ensemble of publicly available data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [1]. The ensemble data are formed through different runs of a simulation model with different perturbations of the initial conditions to account for the errors in the initial conditions and/or model parameterizations. The ensemble consists of isocontours of the temperature field (isovalue −15C) at 500mb in altitude.

(Republicans took advantage of this, putting up billboards that read, \\"The DFL is going to face something scary — an election\\".) First, after Walter Mondale was elected Vice President in 1976, sitting Governor Wendell Anderson resigned so that Lieutenant Governor Rudy Perpich, as the new governor, could appoint Anderson to the open seat. This did not sit well with the electorate. Then, in January 1978, Minnesota's other Senate seat opened up when Hubert Humphrey died; Perpich appointed Humphrey's widow, Muriel, to the office. But she did not want to run that fall, and the DFL nominated Bob Short for the post. Though Democrats maintained large majorities in both the U.S. House and Senate, the November election was something of a disappointment for them, as they lost a handful of seats in both chambers. But for Minnesota's DFL it was a disaster, later dubbed the \\"Minnesota Massacre\\". Plywood magnate Rudy Boschwitz campaigned as a liberal Republican, freely spent his own money, and defeated Anderson by 16 points, while David Durenberger crushed Short by 26 points. Al Quie completed the Republican trifecta by downing Perpich 52% to 45%. (Perpich would be reelected governor in 1982 and 1986.) It was the first time the GOP had held all three offices since Joseph H. Ball left the Senate in January 1949. Democratic–Farmer–Labor primary =Candidates= Declared * Daryl W.

Members included conductors, trainmen, engineers, shop mechanics, porters and maintenance-of-way employees. It joined the United Transportation Union in 1970. Origins Thomas Redd, a brakeman on the Illinois Central Railroad who had been born soon after the American Civil War ended in 1865, was the prime mover in forming the association. The Association of Colored Railway Trainmen and Locomotive Firemen (ACRT) was founded in 1912, and in 1920 Redd became chairman of its grievance committee. By the late 1920s he was president of its Louisville, Kentucky, chapter. However, he was unable to obtain recognition from the Illinois Central, which would only talk to him as an individual. During the Great Depression of the 1930s black workers faced high unemployment and efforts, sometimes violent, by white workers and unions to displace them. The Bureau of Labor Statistics's 1936 Handbook of American trade-unions noted that \\"Negroes are ineligible for membership in most of the standard railroad unions and have therefore formed their own, somewhat sporadically and for the most part locally.\\" Redd decided to try to form a national movement, hoping for strength from numbers. In early 1934 Claude Barnett, head of the Associated Negro Press, was asked for help by the ACRT attorney. Barnett brought in Robert L. Mays to organize a publicity campaign for the planned Association of Railway Employees. Dozens of delegates from local organizations answered Redd's call and met in Chicago in September 1934 to found the association. Formation At the first meeting the delegates did not have the authority to organize, but they came to a meeting in Washington in November 1934 with that authority. The IARE was established as a central organization that would protest against contracts that discriminated racially, inequality in seniority treatment and white terrorism. Redd was elected president and Mays secretary. There were 28 members organizations that claimed to represent a total of 15,000 black railroad workers. History At the time the 1936 Handbook of American trade-unions was prepared, the Bureau did not treat the International Association of Railway Employees as an established organization, since the undertaking still had a \\"tentative and formative nature.\\" In the late 1930s the IARE hired civil rights attorney Charles Hamilton Houston to present their case, and he continued to work for them for the next ten years. In the 1940s the IARE helped the Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC) in its investigations into discrimination, although during World War II the government chose not to follow up and potentially disrupt the vital railroad industry. The IARE remained relatively small and did not have much power. However, the legal challenges it launched in the 1940s and 1950s over discrimination in employment and union membership were eventually successful. Arthur Shores became general counsel for the IARE. In 1941 he took on the case of Steele v. Louisville & Nashville Railway Co. in which B. W. Steele, a member of the IARE executive, argued that an agreement between the railway and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen (BLFE) was illegal. A whites-only railroad union could not exclude blacks and then deny them better jobs because they were not union members. In this case, the BLFE had made an agreement with the L&N; that whites would get the traditionally dirty and dangerous fireman job on the cleaner and safer diesel engines. Shores worked on the case with Charles H. Houston, who argued it in front of the Supreme Court of the United States in 1944. The case was successful, and the BLFE and L&N; had to abandon their agreement. In 1951 an agreement was made by which black firemen retained their jobs on many of the long-haul diesel runs. In 1969 Marion W. Garnett filed suite on behalf of the International Association of Railroad Employees, still an all-black union, against the Illinois Central Railroad, the Order of Railway Conductors and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. He charged them with hiring African-Americans as porters and mailhandlers but refusing to give them jobs as conductors, engineers and yard switchmen. The IARE joined the recently formed United Transportation Union on 1 September 1970.

The ride opened to the public in 1909 and operated until 1926. The Backety-Back Scenic Railway was notable for a backward-traveling innovation which would be adopted many years later in more modern steel roller coasters. It was also one of the earliest shuttle roller coasters to be built, as well as being the second roller coaster to be built in the Crystal Beach amusement park. The coaster has been cited as a particularly beautiful example of roller coaster architecture. History Backety-Back Scenic Railway was built in 1909 by Pennsylvanian John H. Brown and construction of the coaster cost $50,000. Backety-Back Scenic Railway was the only roller coaster Brown would ever build. In 1904, however, he patented the unique track-reversal design which made the coaster a predecessor to modern shuttle roller coasters. Track layout and ride experience Being a shuttle roller coaster, Backety- Back Scenic Railway traveled over its course both forwards and backwards. The coaster had two lift hills and also necessitated the operation of a switchman when the coaster had reached the end of its forward progress. Following this reversal, the train would engage a second reversal and continue on its way. The course of the roller coaster was a twister layout and the roller coaster had a curved tunnel in its course as well. Trains had 2 cars of 5 rows apiece, with each row having two riders. The coaster had a large station which resembled a riverboat in shape. Inside this station was a ticket office (tickets were sold for 10 cents) and the queue for the ride itself. Incidents In 1910, a 17-year-old girl, Louise Koch was killed after falling from the Backety-Back Scenic Railway. The coaster had minimal safety features, and the only restraints were the sides of the cars themselves.

The La Salle operated at that location until 1910. Then it moved into a new facility at 110 West Madison, operating as playhouse until 1927, when film began to predominate. The theater closed in the late 1940s. In the spring of 1950, the building was razed to make way for St. Peter's Church.  Tenants & owners  The original La Salle was owned by Anna Sinton Taft, wife the Charles Phelps Taft, who was the brother of U.S. President William Howard Taft. The tenant, from about 1903 until 1910, was Mort H. Singer; in 1910, after lengthy legal action, the theater was won by Harry Askin (1864–1934) and the La Salle Opera House Company, composed of Charles W. Murphy, owner of the Chicago Cubs, Askin and several other minor associates. In June 1917, Sinton sold the La Salle (from 118 to 116 West Madison) to S. W. Strauss & Co., headed by Albert L. Strauss (1871–1918). In 1927, La Salle began showing movies. It closed in the late 1940s. In the spring of 1950, the building was razed to make way for St. Peter's Church.

A London bus passes a branch of Marks and Spencer. Mare Street is a street in the London Borough of Hackney. It has existed since the 15th century, when it was one of the first roads at the centre of the parish. It was then known as Merestret. The word mere was either the Old English mǣre meaning a boundary — referring to the boundary with the parish of Stepney — or mere, a large pond which was fed by Hackney Brook. Location Mare Street runs north-south through the centre of Hackney. It starts at the junction of Dalston Lane with the Lower Clapton Road and runs south to the Regent's Canal. The northernmost section is a largely traffic- free shopping street, known as The Narroway. South of the North London Line at Hackney Central railway station, Mare Street follows the A107 to the canal, where it becomes the Cambridge Heath Road. History Mare Street was established by 1593 when the Flying Horse Inn was a staging post for travellers. By 1720, it was the most populous part of Hackney. In the 18th century, St Thomas’ Hospital was developed on Mare Street, followed by a Congregational chapel. The Great Eastern Railway came to Mare Street in 1872, bringing more residential development, as well as institutions including Morley Hall, later the Electric Cinema, Lady Eleanor Holles School (on the site later used by Cordwainers College) and St Joseph's hospice. After the First World War, the area became more industrial, and after World War II, a mixture of bomb damage and slum clearance led to building of housing estates and Hackney Technical College. In 1945, the Cordwainers' College moved from Clerkenwell to 182 Mare Street (formerly Lady Holles's School and the Dalston county school). Mary Wollstonecraft, author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, pioneer of women's rights and mother of Mary Shelley, lived at what is now 373–375 Mare Street in 1784. Notable buildings The 14th century St Augustine's Tower on the Narroway, is a remnant of Hackney parish's medieval church which was replaced by the present St. John at Hackney church in 1797. The Hackney Empire is at 291 Mare Street. Built by Frank Matcham in 1901 as a music hall, it was later used as a television studio and a bingo hall, before reopening as a theatre in 1986. Next to the Hackney Empire is Hackney Town Hall, a stone-faced 1930s art deco building, set back from Mare Street with a landscaped forecourt. The London College of Fashion is at 182 Mare Street, having incorporated the former Cordwainers' College. The Ash Grove bus garage is at Mare Street, being operated by two operators: CT Plus and Arriva London. File:Hackney Empire, Mare Street.JPGThe Hackney Empire is a prominent Victorian music hall.

Described by J. B. S. Haldane as the \\"Mother of British Plant Genetics\\", she played an active role in the re-discovery of Mendel's laws of heredity, the understanding of trait inheritance in plants, and was the first collaborator of the geneticist William Bateson. She also developed extensive work on flower anatomy, particularly focusing on the gynoecia, the female reproductive organs of flowers. Biography Saunders was born on October 14 1865 in Brighton, England. She was educated first at Handsworth Ladies' College and in 1884 she entered the female-only Newnham College, Cambridge.Edith Rebecca Saunders entry on Encyclopædia Britannica: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1758746/Edith-Rebecca-Saunders There, she attended both Part I (in 1887) and II (in 1888) of the Natural Sciences Tripos. Marion Greenwood is second from left and Edith Saunders is at right She continued to post-graduate research, and served as a demonstrator at the Balfour Biological Laboratory for Women between 1888-1890 (where students from Newnham and Girton colleges received preparation for the Natural Sciences Tripos). She was the last director of that Laboratory between 1890-1914. She was also director of studies at Girton College (1904–1914) and Newnham College (1918–1925). She was appointed a fellow of the Royal Horticulture Society from which she received the Banksian Medal in 1906. In 1905 she was one of the first women elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London, later serving on its Council (1910 - 1915) and as Vice-President during 1912- 1913. In 1920 she was the president of the botanical section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. She also served as president of the Genetics Society, between 1936 and 1938.List of presidents of the Genetics Society: http://www.genetics.org.uk/About/PastPresidentsoftheSociety.aspx During World War II she served as a volunteer helping the Allied forces. She died soon after returning to Britain, in 1945, after suffering injuries in a bicycle accident. Research Saunders' earlier research focused on genetics. Many of her genetic experiments led to her and William Bateson defining important terms like \\"allelomorphs\\" (nowadays referred to as alleles), heterozygote and homozygote.Bateson, W. and Saunders, E. R. (1902) \\"The facts of heredity in the light of Mendel’s discovery.\\" Reports to the Evolution Committee of the Royal Society, I. pp 125-160 Furthermore, together with Bateson and Reginald Punnett she co-discovered genetic linkage.Discovery and Types of Genetic Linkage, from Scitable She also did extensive work in plant anatomy, particularly concerning gynoecia, having published several articles on the subject (noteworthy is her series of articles on \\"Illustrations of Carpel Polymorphism\\" published in the journal New Phytologist between 1928 and 1931).
