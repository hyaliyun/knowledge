In a brief racing career which lasted from the autumn of 1976 until August 1977 he ran seven times and won three races. In 1977 he was one of the leading three-year-old colts in Europe, recording Group One successes in the Eclipse Stakes and Sussex Stakes. He was retired to stud at the end of the season and had limited success as a breeding stallion. Background Artaius was a bay horse bred in Kentucky by John Wesley Hanes II. His sire, Round Table was one of the most successful grass specialists in American racing history, winning forty-three races and being named American Horse of the Year in 1958. He became a highly successful breeding stallion, being the Leading sire in North America in 1972. His dam, Stylish Pattern was descended from the influential broodmare Molly Adare, whose others descendants included Brigadier Gerard and Vintage Crop. As a yearling, Artaius was offered for sale and bought for $110,000 by representatives of Mrs George Getty II. The colt was sent to Europe to be trained by Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle. He was ridden in most of his races by Lester Piggott. Racing career Artaius did not run until the autumn of 1976 when he finished second to Orchestra in the Group Two Beresford Stakes over one mile at the Curragh. On his first appearance as a three-year-old, Artaius was sent to England to contest the Group Three Classic Trial Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse. He started the evens favourite and won comfortably from Night Before. The colt returned to Ireland and was brought back in distance for the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh and finished unplaced behind Pampapaul and The Minstrel. Artaius was then sent to France to contest the Prix du Jockey Club at Chantilly Racecourse where he finished second, half a length behind Crystal Palace. In July Artaius was sent off at odds of 9/2 for the Group One Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park. He led from the start and won in a race record time of 2:05.30 from Lucky Wednesday and Arctic Tern. A month later Artaius started the 6/4 favourite for the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood where his opponents included the classic winners Nebbiolo and Mrs McArdy. He led from the start again and won easily from Free State with Relkino in third place. At York Racecourse in August, Artaius started odds-on favourite for the sixth running of the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup. In a major upset he was beaten four lengths into second place by Relkino. Assessment In 1977, Artaius was given a rating of 129 by the independent Timeform organisation, eight pounds behind his stable companion Alleged. Stud record Artaius was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in Ireland. He was exported to Japan in 1984. He was not a successful sire of winners. The best of his offspring was probably the filly Flame of Tara, who won the Coronation Stakes and produced the outstanding racemare Salsabil and the St James's Palace Stakes winner Marju. In Japan he sired Osumi Roch, who won the Kyoto Daishoten and the Kyoto Kinen in 1992 as well as finishing third in the Takarazuka Kinen. He was also the damsire of the Prix de Diane winner Rafha, who produced the successful sire Invincible Spirit. He was \\"put out of stud\\" in Japan in November 1997.

He had been suffering from various health problems, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and left a suicide note that was later published on Gawker, after which it went viral. Background Daniel Somers was the son of a physician and a health-care administrator. He married Angeline Roth, his former high school sweetheart, in 2001. The couple had no children. Somers enlisted in the National Guard in 2003. One year later he was deployed to Iraq as part of the Tactical Human Intelligence Team. In Operation Iraqi Freedom he served over 400 combat missions. By 2008, a year after the end of his second deployment, he had been diagnosed with PTSD, traumatic brain injury (suffered in combat), fibromyalgia, and a host of other medical problems. After returning from the war in 2007, Somers founded a band in the Phoenix area called Lisa Savige. He served as guitarist, vocalist, songwriter, and bandleader for the group. Lisa Savige performed at various live events in the US Southwest and on KWSS-LP, the independent radio station in Phoenix, frequently donating its proceeds to benefit people wounded in the Middle East. Lisa Savidge disbanded in 2011. Somers sent a letter to the VA in October 2011, describing his symptoms as worsening in several ways, including nightly panic attacks and auditory hallucinations. In that letter, he said his situation \\"drives me to consider suicide very seriously on a daily basis.\\" Death and aftermath On June 10, 2013, Somers died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head at the age of 30 in Phoenix, Arizona. According to his suicide note, feeling deeply troubled by his involvement in the Iraq War and a lack of post-combat support from the US government were two primary reasons behind choosing to kill himself: Three weeks after her husband's death, Angel Somers was notified by the Phoenix VA that her husband's claim for full disability benefits had been approved retroactively to 2008. Musicians in the Phoenix area organized a tribute concert for him on August 24, 2013. The Arizona Republic quoted US Representative from Arizona Kyrsten Sinema: \\"Daniel Somers is the original whistle-blower of the Phoenix VA\\" (Friday, July 11, 2014, pages A1 and A16). His parents continue to press for systemic change in the VA system. Somers' death highlighted the ongoing struggle of US veterans dealing with the consequences of their involvement in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Former US Representative Ron Paul described Somers as representing \\"a generation of American veterans facing a life sentence in the prison of tortured and deeply damaged minds as well as broken bodies.... We should be angry with those who send them to suffer and die in unnecessary wars. We should be angry with those who send them to kill so many people overseas for no purpose whatsoever.\\" Somers' parents, Jean and Howard Somers, have become strong advocates for the well being of returning soldiers and for PTSD awareness. They met with Congressional and VA officials in August 2013 and authorized the release of their son's records to the Washington Post in an effort to document publicly how the VA failed him, hoping they might help others in the process. Steve Vogel of the Washington Post described Somers' death as \\"a case study in how federal agencies continue to fail veterans.\\" In that article, Kim Ruocco, director of Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), is quoted as saying the case \\"shines a light on these issues.\\" The New York Times published an article written by the couple on November 11, 2013 (Veterans Day in the US), in which they told their son's story and advocated for awareness and change in the way veterans receive health care. They proposed that the VA prioritize care based on severity of the patient's condition, and that the VA also commit all of its hospitals and clinical services to treating veterans with conditions resulting from combat, and contract routine care services to other providers. In May 2014, one month after initial reports of the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014 were aired on CNN, and nearly a year after their son's suicide, Jean and Howard Somers announced \\"Operation Engage America,\\" their own plan to raise awareness and educate Americans about the special needs of veterans returning home with what they had begun to call \\"moral injury.\\" The plan included advocating for an easily accessible online resource for loved ones of returning soldiers that would help them understand the special problems the veterans might be dealing with, such as PTSD. The plan also included advocating for a contractual requirement with health professionals working for the VA to give 90 days notice before leaving the VA. The purpose of this was to preserve continuity of care for veterans who were currently being treated. Operation Engage America was launched on June 7, 2014, with two \\"resource fairs\\", one in San Diego, CA, and the other in Des Moines, IA. Their website indicates their intention to make it an annual event. On Thursday, July 10, 2014, they testified before the US House Veterans' Affairs Committee and proposed a number of specific reforms.

It was published in London on 3 February 1739 and dedicated by the composer to King John V of Portugal. The latter summoned the composer to Lisbon to teach his daughter, Barbara of Portugal, to play the harpsichord. The Italian title mirrors that of Clavier-√úbung in German, which means the same thing, which is also notably used to refer to a group of pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach. Presented as teaching tool, the pieces, often of great virtuosity, also earn a place in the concert hall through their musicality. Conceived for the harpsichord, they have also been honored on the piano by great virtuosos. Of the 555 sonatas written by Domenico Scarlatti, only these were edited with his participation. The rest remained unpublished while he was alive or were published without his supervision. Essercizi per gravicembalo made a technical musical contribution and gave innovative ideas to fellow composers of the time. Their main novelty consists in arpeggios, repeated notes and crossed hands, characteristics that to this day offer object lessons to students learning to play keyboard instruments. Like all of this composer‚Äôs pieces for harpsichord, these sonatas, invariably a single movement and a have binary structure, are imbued with the greatest originality, both musical and in interpretive technique. The work begins with a preface: \\"Reader, do not expect, whether you are a dilettante or a professor, to find in these compositions any profound intention, but rather an ingenious banter in the art to exercise you in rigorous play of the harpsichord. No point of view or ambition guided me, but obedience brought me to publish it. Perhaps they will be agreeable to you, and I will more willingly then obey your other orders to please you with an easier and mre varied style. Therefore do not show yourself more judge than critic, and you will thereby grow your own pleasure. To specify hand position I have used the letter D to indicate the right hand, and the letter M the left hand.

California Invasive Plant Council. It is native to parts of Asia and Eastern Europe, and it is known on other continents as an introduced species, including North and South America and Australia. It is a weed, invasive at times. The Latin word hyssopifolia (which also occurs in several other plant names, including that of cuphea hyssopifolia) means \\"hyssop-leafed\\".James Donn, Hortus Cantabrigiensis: or, a Catalogue of Plants, Indigenous and Exotic (1809), p. 5 Description This species is an annual herb with simple or branching stems usually growing up to a metre tall,Bassia hyssopifolia. Flora of North America. or sometimes taller.Bassia hyssopifolia. The Jepson Manual, Jepson eFlora 2012.Fivehook bassia, Bassia hyssopifolia. University of California Statewide Integrated Pest Management Program. 2011. The leaf blades are flat and linear to lance- shaped. The lowest leaves are up to 6 centimetres long. The inflorescence is a short, narrow spike occupying the upper stem. It is lined with woolly-haired flowers growing solitary, paired, or in clusters of three. The small flower has five segments, each of which has a hooked spine at maturity. The fruit is less than 2 millimetres long. The hooked spines of the flower persist on the dry fruit. This species resembles kochia (Bassia scoparia), but it has longer, hairier flower spikes. It has been mistaken for Russian thistle (Kali tragus), but it is less branched and less spiny. It is also similar to lamb's quarters (Chenopodium album), but its leaves are smaller and narrow to a point. Distribution This plant is native to Eurasia and was first described from the Caspian Sea region.Bassia hyssopifolia. NatureServe. 2012. It may have spread beyond its native range as a seed contaminant, possibly of alfalfa seed. It was first recorded in North America in 1915 near Fallon, Nevada. By 1921, it was noted in the Central Valley of California, and by 1940, it was present from British Columbia to Wyoming and had established in eastern North America. The seeds are probably dispersed when the spiny dry fruits catch in animal fur and feathers, and human activity such as road maintenance may aid their spread and establishment. Biology This plant grows easily in alkaline and saline soils. While it has been known to displace native flora at times, it is more persistent than competitive; it simply tolerates stress better than many other plants. On land with little disturbance, native plants can replace it. It generally does not have a strong negative effect on local ecosystems. Infestations are rarely severe. Livestock will graze on the plant, but it is toxic to them, particularly to sheep, which have been known to die after just one feeding. The foliage contains potassium oxalate. It has been cited as one of the major plant species causing oxalate poisoning in ruminants.Aslani, M. R., et al. (2011). Acute oxalate intoxication associated to ingestion of eshnan (Seidlitzia rosmarinus) in sheep. Tropical Animal Health and Production 43(6), 1065-68. Control Where B. hyssopifolia occurs as an introduced weed it may be controlled by several methods, including hand- pulling. It does not resprout from root bits left in the soil. Seedlings can be cut off at ground level. The plant could be controlled with herbicides, akin to kochia and Russian thistle infestations, but it has rarely required such a treatment. Fire has also been used to restore native bird nesting grounds taken over by B. hyssopifolia.https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2020-02-15/feds-burn- island-weeds-at-mono-lake-to-help-birds-feather-their-nests References External links *Bassia hyssopifolia.

He has starred in all of the films that he has written and directed. He is best known for his work on the films The FP and Vs. Jason Trost either wears an eyepatch on his right eye or has his right eye covered in all of his movies and public appearances. He has stated that this is done out of necessity because he is blind in his right eye. Career Jason Trost first attained a cult following in 2011 with the film The FP, a movie which centers around a group of gangs that settle disputes by playing a video game called \\"Beat-Beat Revelation\\" (a very similar game to Dance Dance Revolution). Trost first got the idea for The FP when he was 16 years old, and he lived in Frazier Park, California (which the film is named after). Trost and his high-school friends used to play Dance Dance Revolution and Def Jam Vendetta, and came up with a concept for a setting in which urban gang members battled over turf and pride through arcade dance games. The film also is a sort of defiance piece, since Trost has claimed that the film's title was intentionally made to mock The OC. Trost starred in the film as the main protagonist, JTro. Since the release of The FP, Trost went on to release the film Vs (\\"versus\\", abbreviated) in 2011. During post- production, Vs went through a name change and was released with the title All Superheroes Must Die (often seen as ASMD) in order to make the movie more marketable. In contrast to The FP, ASMD is a more serious action thriller which focuses on four superheroes who have been stripped of their powers by an evil supervillain. The heroes then have to race against the clock while playing sadistic games in order save a small town from being destroyed. Trost described the film as being a mixture of Saw and The Running Man. Trost starred in the film as the superhero, Charge. Trost released the film Wet and Reckless on August 8, 2013. The film is a satire of reality television and follows two morally corrupted reality show veterans who are joined by a new cast member. While the actors are in Thailand filming the newest season of their show, their production company cuts off contact and funding to the actors in a bid to get them to break their contract and make way for a new cast. The movie then follows the actors as they search Thailand for a treasure map that will lead them to a treasure to make them rich enough to get home. Trost played the role of The Lobo, who is a narcissistic former U.S. Marine. Trost reprised a cannibal version of his role as JTro in the 2013 blockbuster film This is the End, although he had no lines in the film and was uncredited. Trost also played the role of Hamilton in the 2013 slasher film, Hatchet III. Trost has plans to make The FP into a trilogy. Trost also set up a crowdsourcing campaign on Indiegogo in order to fund a sequel to All Superheroes Must Die. The sequel had the tentative title, A World Without Superheroes., now The Last Superhero. Trost starred in a trilogy of music videos by the thrash metal band, Slayer, in support of their album, Repentless, the first one being the title track. The video depicts Slayer playing in a prison yard in front of rioting inmates and prison guards who are wearing riot gear and carrying shields. Most of the video is shot from the inside of the prison, where Jason Trost (who plays the role of a convict) releases an entire prison cell block in order to get revenge on an apparent rival inmate. The video sports a large cast of veteran horror film actors, such as Danny Trejo, Derek Mears, Tyler Mane, Tony Moran (actor), Vernon Wells, and Sean Whalen. The video was released on September 11, 2015. The other two videos out in this trilogy are \\"You Against You\\" and \\"Pride in Prejudice\\".

In dominance drawing, vertices are placed at distinct points of the Euclidean plane and a vertex v is reachable from another vertex u if and only if both Cartesian coordinates of v are greater than or equal to the coordinates of u. The edges of a dominance drawing may be drawn either as straight line segments, or, in some cases, as polygonal chains. Planar graphs Every transitively reduced st-planar graph, a directed acyclic planar graph with a single source and a single sink, both on the outer face of some embedding of the graph, has a dominance drawing. The left-right algorithm for finding these drawings sets the x coordinate of every vertex to be its position in a depth-first search ordering of the graph, starting with s and prioritizing edges in right-to-left order, and by setting the y coordinate to be obtained in the same way but prioritizing edges in left-to-right order. Typical dominance drawing algorithms include another phase of compaction after this coordinate assignment, shifting vertices down and to the left as much as possible while preserving the properties of a dominance drawing. The resulting drawing lies within an n √ó n integer grid, and displays many of the symmetries of the underlying topological embedding. This drawing, and more generally every dominance drawing of a transitively-reduced st-planar graph, is necessarily planar, with straight-line edges. For st-planar graphs that are not transitively reduced, an equivalent transitively reduced graph may be obtained by subdividing each edge. However, a straight-line drawing of the resulting transitively reduced graph will form a drawing of the original graph in which some edges have bends, at the dummy vertices introduced by the subdivision. A planar dominance drawing is not necessarily an upward planar drawing, because some edges may be horizontal, but rotating it by 45¬∞ necessarily gives an upward planar drawing. In a comparison with other methods for drawing directed acyclic graphs, the left-right algorithm (together with a planarization preprocessing step) was found to perform well in terms of the area of the drawings it produces, the number of bends, and the aspect ratio of the drawing, but less well in total edge length. Nonplanar graphs A directed acyclic graph (regardless of planarity) has a dominance drawing if and only if the partially ordered set of its vertices, ordered by reachability, has order dimension two. The (rotated) dominance drawing of a transitively reduced directed acyclic graph may be used as a Hasse diagram of the corresponding partial order. Codominance Given a dominance drawing of a directed acyclic graph D1 = (V, E1), inverting the interpretation of one axis results in a new relation one could call coreachability. Thus a point (xa, ya) could be considered coreachable from a point (xb, yb) whenever xa ‚â• xb but ya ‚â§ yb. In this way, the dominance drawing may be seen to induce a second directed acyclic graph D2 = (V, E2) on the same vertex set. The pairs {‚â§1, ‚â§2} of partial orders on a shared ground set that permit such simultaneous representation by a single drawing‚Äîinterpreted in terms of reachability and coreachability‚Äîare called codominant. Weak dominance drawing For directed acyclic graphs whose reachability order has higher dimension, a weak dominance drawing is a drawing in which every edge is oriented upwards, rightwards, or both, but in which there exist pairs of vertices (u, v) for which u dominates v coordinatewise but v is not reachable from u in the graph. We said that a vertex u dominates another vertex v if the coordinates (u_x, u_y) of u are less or equal the coordinates (v_x, v_y) of v, i.e., u_x <= v_x and u_y <= v_y considering a XY-plane. The goal in this style of drawing is to minimize the number of such falsely implied paths.

The present armed forces trace their roots to the early 20th century, yet the history of Polish armed forces in their broadest sense stretches back much further. After the partitions of Poland, during the period from 1795 until 1918, Polish military was recreated several times during national insurrections that included the November Uprising of 1830, and the January Uprising in 1863, and the Napoleonic Wars that saw the formation of the Polish Legions in Italy. The Congress Poland, being part of the Russian Empire with a certain degree of autonomy, had a separate Polish army in the years 1815‚Äì1830, which was disbanded after the unsuccessful November Uprising. Large numbers of Poles also served in the armies of the partitioning powers, Russian Empire, Austria- Hungary (before 1867 Austria) and Germany (before 1871 Prussia). During World War I, the Polish Legions were set up in Galicia, the southern part of Poland under Austrian occupation. They were both disbanded after the Central Powers failed to provide guarantees of Polish independence after the war. General J√≥zef Haller, the commander of the Second Brigade of the Polish Legion, switched sides in late 1917, and via Murmansk took part of his troops to France, where he created the Blue Army. It was joined by several thousand Polish volunteers from the United States. It fought on the French front in 1917 and 1918. The Polish Army was recreated in 1918 from elements of the three separate Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and German armies, and armed with equipment left following World War I. The force expanded during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War of 1919‚Äì1922 to nearly 800,000 men, but then were reduced after peace was reestablished. At the onset of World War II, on 1 September 1939 Nazi Germany invaded Poland. Polish forces were overwhelmed by the German attack in September 1939, which was followed on 17 September 1939 by an invasion by the Soviet Union. Some Polish forces escaped from the occupied country and joined Allied forces fighting in other theaters while those that remained in Poland splintered into guerilla units of the Armia Krajowa (\\"Home Army\\") and other partisan groups which fought in clandestine ways against the foreign occupiers. Thus, there were three threads to Polish armed forces from 1939; the Polish Armed Forces in the West, the Armia Krajowa and other resistance organizations fighting the Germans in Poland, and the Polish Armed Forces in the East, which later became the post-war communist Polish People's Army (LWP). Until the fall of communism, the army's prestige under communist rule continued to fall, as it was used by the government to resettle ethnic minorities immediately after the war (Operation Vistula), and to violently suppress opposition several times, during the 1956 Pozna≈Ñ protests, the 1970 Polish protests, and during martial law in Poland in 1981‚Äì1982. The LWP also took part in the suppressing of the 1968 democratization process of Czechoslovakia, commonly known as the Prague Spring. That same year Marshal of Poland Marian Spychalski was asked to replace Edward Ochab as chairman of the Council of State, and General Wojciech Jaruzelski, at that time the Chief of the General Staff, was named to replace him.Michta, 1990, p.59, citing the Polish army daily ≈ªo≈Çnierz Wolno≈õci, April 12, 1968 Jaruzelski, a known Soviet loyalist, was put in place by the Soviets in order to ensure that a trusted group of officers was in control of one of the least trusted armies in the Warsaw Pact.Michta, 1990, p.62. Michta's footnote emphasises that Spychalski would not have been the right officer to have in charge of the Armed Forces of the People's Republic of Poland during the invasion. =Present-day operations= Polish military interventions since 1990: Gulf War, Operation Uphold Democracy, War on Terror and Operation Serval After January 1990 and the collapse of the communist block, the name of the armed forces was changed to \\"Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland\\" to accord with the Polish State's new official name. Following the subsequent disbandment of the Warsaw Pact, Poland was admitted into NATO on 12 March 1999 and the Polish armed forces began a major reorganization effort in order to conform to the new western standards. In March 2003, the Polish Armed Forces took part in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, deploying special forces and a support ship.Around 200 Polish soldiers took part in combat, including GROM and Formoza (Naval Frogmen Group) special forces, a chemical decontamination unit as well as the ORP Kontradmira≈Ç X. Czernicki logistical ship. (Rafa≈Ç Domisiewicz, Consolidating the Security Sector in Post-Conflict States: Polish Lessons from Iraq, Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs) Following the destruction of Saddam's regime the Polish Land Forces supplied a brigade and a division headquarters for the 17-nation Multinational Division Central-South, part of the U.S.-led Multi-National Force ‚Äì Iraq. At its peak Poland had 2,500 soldiers in the south of the country. Other completed operations include 2005 'Swift Relief' in Pakistan, in which NATO Response Force-allocated personnel were despatched. Polish Land Forces personnel sent to Pakistan included a military engineers company, a platoon of the 1st Special Commando Regiment, and a logistics component from the 10th Logistics Brigade. Elsewhere, Polish forces were sent to MINURCAT in Chad and the Central African Republic (2007‚Äì2010). As of 2008, Poland had deployed 985 personnel in eight separarate UN peacekeeping operations (the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, MINURSO, MONUC, UNOCI, UNIFIL, UNMEE, UNMIK, UNMIL, and UNOMIG). GROM special operations unit secures a section of the port of Umm Qasr in Iraq, 2003 Formerly set up according to Warsaw Pact standards, the Polish armed forces are now fully organized according to NATO requirements. Poland is also playing an increasingly larger role as a major European peacekeeping power in the world through various UN peacekeeping actions, and cooperation with neighboring nations through multinational formations and units such as the Multinational Corps Northeast and POLUKRBAT. As of 1 January 2010, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland have transitioned to a completely contract-based manpower supply system. Rosomak armored vehicle on patrol in Ghazni, Afghanistan, 2010 On 10 April 2010, a Polish Air Force Tu-154M crashed near Smolensk, Russia while in transit to a ceremony commemorating the Katyn massacre. On board the plane were the President (Commander-in-Chief), the Chief of Staff, all four Branch Commanders of the Polish Military, and a number of other military officials; all were killed. In 2014‚Äì2015, the Armed Forces General Command and Armed Forces Operational Command were both established, superseding the previous individual service branch command structures. Organization The Polish Armed Forces consist of 117,800 active duty and 73,000 reserve personnel. In 2018, troop strength in the five different branches was as follows: * border Land Forces (Wojska LƒÖdowe): 61,200 * border Air Force (Si≈Çy Powietrzne): 18,700 * border Navy (Marynarka Wojenna): 7,000 ~83 vessels * border Special Forces (Wojska Specjalne): 3,400 * border Territorial Defence Force (Wojska Obrony Terytorialnej): 14,000 in 2018, 17,200 (as of January 2019https://www.defence24.pl/trzeci-rok- szkolenia-3-podkarpackiej-brygady-wot; 53,000 planned by 2021)https://www.defence24.pl/rosnie-stan-osobowy-wojsk-obrony-terytorialnej All five branches are supported by: * Military infrastructure: 13,500, including: **Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Poland (Ministerstwo Obrony Narodowej) ** Central support **Military command **Supply and military logistics * Military Gendarmerie (≈ªandarmeria Wojskowa): 4,500http://www.dz.urz.mon.gov.pl/zasoby/dziennik/pozycje/zalaczniki/2013/02/Zal._do_Poz._49_2.pdf * Military reserve forces: 20,000 (Part-time volunteers which serve within the Land Forces, Navy and Air Force)Onet.pl, Rewolucja w polskiej armii- Wiadomo≈õci , 21 March 2009 Equipment A Polish Air Force F-16C Fighting Falcon during a military exercise, 2019 Since 2011, the Armed Forces are in the middle of a long-term modernisation programme. Plans involve new anti- aircraft missile systems, ballistic missile defense systems, a Lead-In Fighter Trainer (LIFT) aircraft, medium transport and combat helicopters, submarines, unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as self-propelled howitzers. Technical modernization plans for the years 2013 through to 2022 have been put in place. During the 2013 to 2016 period of the plan, 37.8 billion PLN, or 27.8% of the period's military budget of 135.5 billion PLN was invested into technical modernisation. offshore patrol vessel in the Baltic sea, 2015 Significant military equipment acquisitions are also planned for through the 2022 period, with the Ministry of Defense outlying 61 billion z≈Çoty to be spent on further modernization. A major feature of the program is the acquisition of around 1,200 unmanned aerial vehicles, including at least 1,000 with combat capabilities. Additionally, new helicopters and air defense systems are to be procured along with five light vessels for the navy. A new submarine force is to be jointly operated with a NATO partner, and general upgrade and modernization efforts are aimed at the country's air defenses, naval forces, cyber warfare capabilities, armored forces, and territorial defense forces (to have 50,000 volunteer members). Traditions Honor Guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw's Pi≈Çsudski Square The Polish armed forces has consistently held two yearly military parades () on Armed Forces Day and National Independence Day. These parades take place on Ujazd√≥w Avenue and near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on Pi≈Çsudski Square respectively. The Armed Forces Day Parade was introduced in 2007 and 2008 as first grand military parades since the holiday was reinstated and have been held yearly since 2013. The first Polish military parade took place on 17 January 1945 and as of 2019, the 3 May Constitution Day parade was officially reinstated. Marsz Generalski and Warszawianka (1831) are the main military musical pieces performed at ceremonial events. While the former is a solemn march used during inspections and the march on of the Polish flag, the latter is a march strictly used for march pasts, military parades and other processions. The Polish Armed Forces are the only military entity in the world to use a two-finger salute which is only used while wearing a hat (it refers to the fact that the salute is given to the emblem itself) with the emblem of the Polish eagle, such as military hat rogatywka. The salute is performed with the middle and index fingers extended and touching each other, while the ring and little fingers are bent and touched by the thumb. The tips of the middle and index fingers touch the peak of the cap, two fingers supposedly meaning Honour and Fatherland (Honor i Ojczyzna). Czo≈Çem ≈ªo≈Çnierze (the Polish language version of Greetings Soldiers) is the official military greeting of the armed forces, usually given by the members of the government or military establishment as well as visiting dignitaries during ceremonial occasions. The soldiers will usually respond with Czo≈Çem (States title/rank of dignitaryhttps://www.polsatnews.pl/wiadomosc/2016-08-23/czolem-panie- ministrze-tak-zolnierze-powitali-rzecznika-mon/).

Early life and education Smith, the second child and eldest daughter of George and Juliet Smith, was born at Burn Hall, a family property near Durham, in December 1776. A clever and bookish child, she was never at school, and was chiefly educated by her mother. At the beginning of 1782 the family moved to Suffolk, to be near a blind relative, who died in 1784. They moved back to Burn Hall till June 1785, when the father, who was partner in a West Country banking firm, took Piercefield Park, near Chepstow, Monmouthshire. By this time Elizabeth had made good progress in music. For three years from the spring of 1786 she was under a governess, who taught her French and a little Italian. All her other linguistic attainments were of her own acquiring. The family had a good library, and she read with avidity, especially the poets. Devoting some hours before breakfast each morning to study, she improved her Italian, and by 1793 could read Spanish without difficulty. The declaration of war by France in February 1793 produced a financial crisis which proved fatal to several banks, her father's among the number. In March he gave up Piercefield, and in 1794 took a commission in the army, serving for some years in Ireland. Elizabeth spent seven or eight months at the fashionable spa resort Bath, where her friend Mary Hunt encouraged her to study German and botany. At the end of the year she began Arabic and Persian. She began Latin in November 1794, and by February 1795 had \\"read C√¶sar's Commentaries, Livy, and some volumes of Cicero\\", and was \\"very impatient to begin Virgil\\". After she and her mother joined her father at Sligo, she picked up an Irish grammar at Armagh, and at once began to study it. She must have begun Hebrew soon after returning to Bath in October 1796, as she was translating from the Book of Genesis in 1797. In 1799 she found at Shirley a Syriac New Testament, printed in Hebrew characters, and could \\"read it very well\\". Buxtorf's Florilegium she carried always in her pocket. In the summer of 1799 the family settled at Ballitore, County Kildare, moving in May 1801 to Coniston (then in Lancashire, now in Cumbria), where Smith spent the rest of her life. In May 1802 she met the writer Elizabeth Hamilton (1758‚Äì1816), who thought that \\"with a little of the Scotch frankness ‚Ä¶ she would be one of the most perfect of human beings.\\" Death After a year's decline of health, Smith died at Coniston on 7 August 1806. She was buried at Hawkshead, where there is a tablet to her memory in the parish church. Works Smith's powers of memory and of divination must have been remarkable, for she rarely consulted a dictionary. Translation from Hebrew was her \\"Sunday work\\". Along with her intellectual accomplishments, Smith also excelled at cooking, needlework, and equestrianism. Among her philological collections were lists of words in Welsh, Chinese, and African dialects, with some Icelandic studies. The following were published from her papers: *Fragments, in Prose and Verse ‚Ä¶ with some Account of her Life, by H. M.

Beer anthropologist Eames acquired a reputation as the \\"Indiana Jones of beer\\" in reference to his global quest to learn about the origins of beer and the role it played in ancient societies and cultures. Eames visited 44 countries. In Egypt he found hieroglyphics about beer, and travelled on the Amazon River in search of a lost black brew. In the Andes, Eames trekked in search of a brew made from strawberries that were the size of baseballs. With Professor Solomon Katz of the University of Pennsylvania, Eames formulated the theory that beer was an important factor in the creation of settled and civilised societies. Eames believed that beer was the most feminine of drinks, and thought that ancient societies considered it a gift from a goddess rather than a god, as from the gods Ama-Gestin and Ninkasis. Though not verified photographically or otherwise, Eames claimed to have found the world's \\"oldest beer advertisement\\" on a Mesopotamian stone tablet that dated to roughly 4000 B.C. Eames claimed that the tablet contained the tagline \\"Drink Elba, the beer with the heart of a lion.\\" along with a depiction of a headless woman with large breasts holding goblets of beer in each of her hands. Life Eames was born in Gardner, Massachusetts, the son of anthropologist, Warren Baker Eames. He graduated from Mark Hopkins College in Brattleboro, Vermont. Moving to New York City in 1968, he opened an art gallery, and began researching beer in the New York Public Library. In 1975, he acquired a store named Gleason's from Curt and Kay Gleason in Templeton, Massachusetts, in which he sold a large selection of beers. He also created and ran two branches of his Three Dollar Dewey's Ale House in Portland, Maine, and Brattleboro. Eames was the founding director of the American Museum of Brewing History and Fine Arts in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky. Eames wrote seven books on beer and was a contributor to the Encyclopedia of Beer. Eames also broadcast about beer and advised film- makers on beer-related themes. Eames stopped drinking beer eight years before his death, and died in his sleep of respiratory failure at his home in Dummerston, Vermont, in 2007. He was survived by his fifth wife, Sheila, his sons Adrian and Andrew, and his daughter Elena.

Not Saint Kevin but his brother St Caomh√°n. Even though he is \\"by far the most celebrated of all the saints of the Aran Islands\\", little is known about him.John O'Donovan, 1839, cited in Peter Harbison, Pilgrimage in Ireland. The monuments and the People, 1991, p 91. He is said to have been a disciple of Saint Enda of Aran, which would place him in the 6th century, but his death date has also been recorded as 865.Mordecai Cubitt Cooke, John Eller Taylor, Hardwicke's Science-gossip Volumes 10‚Äì11 (1874), p. 272. The saint's Pattern Day () was formerly 3 November, but was moved to 14 June in the 19th century. There used to be a pilgrimage of the sick to his tomb on his day, and an open-air mass is still celebrated there every year.Fionn Davenport, Ireland, Lonely Planet (2010) p. 410. St Cavan's Church (also \\"St Kevin's Church\\", ) is a ruined church, built in the 10th century, The 10th-century date is given on a notice on site prepared by the Office of Public Works, and is repeated in various travel guides. G. V. Du Noyer in Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy 9 (1867), p. 425 still gives a 7th-century date. Hardwicke's Science-gossip (1874) says it is \\"supposed to be a twelfth-century church\\". at the location of the saint's grave. The entrance is now below ground level, as the church was nearly buried by drifting sands; it has now been excavated and is kept clear of sand by the islanders.\\"the little church of St Cavan, or Kevin, is usually covered by drifting sands, but it is cleared each year in order to hold a service at his tomb, to the north-east of the church.\\" Elizabeth Rees, Celtic Sites and Their Saints (2003), p. 10. In recent times it has been roofed to resist the incursion of blown sand from the surrounding dunes. All that remains visible of this structure today is the chancel. A century or so after this was built, the rest of the building gave way for a wider nave. The lintel over the original western doorway was reused in the enlarged building to become the entrance from the nave to the priest's residence. Three other features date from the late medieval period: the head of the chancel arch, the pointed doorway in the south wall of the nave and the priest's residence. The grave of St Caomhan ( or \\"Caomh√°n's Bed\\") is located to the north-east of the church. It is a tradition on the island to spend the vigil of the saint's feast praying at his grave. It has been written that people were cured of illness here.

Alleged witchcraft At the time of the rebellion in 1745, Osborne went to a farmer by the name of Butterfield, who kept a dairy at Gubblecut, near Tring, in Hertfordshire, and begged for some buttermilk. Butterfield, by a brutal refusal, angered the old woman, who went away muttering that the Pretender would pay him out. In the course of the next year or so a number of the farmer's calves became distempered, and he himself contracted epileptic fits. In the meantime he gave up dairy-farming and took a public-house, The wiseacres who met there attributed his misfortunes to witchcraft, and advised Butterfield to apply to a cunning woman or white witch for a cure. An old woman was fetched from Northamptonshire, and confirmed the suspicion already entertained against Ruth Osborne and her husband John, both harmless old people over seventy years of age. Ducking After some ineffectual measures, recourse was had to on expedient which should at the same time deter the Osbornes from their alleged malpractices and benefit Butterfield and the neighbouring publicans. Notice was given by the crier at the adjoining towns of Winslow, Hemel Hempstead, and Leighton Buzzard, that witches were to be tried by ducking at Longmarstone on 22 April 1751. A large and determined mob mustered at Tring on the day specified, and forced the parish overseer and master of the workhouse by threats to reveal the hiding-place of the unfortunate couple in the vestry of the church, where those officers had placed them for better security. The Osbornes were then stripped, and, with their hands tied to their toes, were thrown into Longmarstone pool. After much ducking and ill-usage the old woman was thrown upon the bank, quite naked and almost choked with mud, and she died in a few minutes. Her dead body was tied to her husband, who was alleged to have died shortly afterwards from the cruel treatment he received, but who ultimately recovered, though he was unable to give evidence at the trial. Aftermath The authorities determined to overawe local sympathy with the rioters, and to make a salutary example. At the coroner's inquest the jury brought in a verdict of wilful murder against one Thomas Colley, a chimney sweep, and against twenty-one other known and unknown persons. Colley had taken a leading part in the outrage, and had collected money from the rabble for 'the sport he had shown them in ducking the old witch.' He was tried at Hertford assizes on 30 July 1751, before Sir Thomas Lee, and his plea that he went into the pond as a friend to try and save Mrs. Osborne being unsupported by evidence, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was escorted from Hertford gaol to St. Albans by two troops of horseguards blue, and the next morning, 24 Aug., was executed at Gubblecut Cross in Tring, and afterwards hanged in chains on the same gallows. 'The infatuation of the greatest part of the country people was so great that they would not be spectators of his death; yet many thousands stood at a distance to see him go, grumbling and muttering that it was a hard case to hang a man for destroying an old wicked woman that had done so much harm by her witchcraft.' It is noticeable that the last case of a witch being condemned by the verdict of an English jury, that of Jane Wenham, also occurred in Hertfordshire in 1712.

He died in London, in exile, in October 1986.Ancestry UK, \\"Joshua Kwabena Siaw - Ancestry UK\\". Ancestry UK, accessed 27 September 2015. Early life Joshua Kwabena Siaw was born in Obomeng, a small town in the Eastern Region of Ghana, in January 1923. His father came from Akwaseho and his mother from Juaben in the Ashanti Region. J. K. Siaw worked with his father on a cocoa farm before attending school, aged 12, in 1935, and he took to basket-making as a way to make more money to further his own education.The Story of Tata, \\"a very comprehensive account of the life of Mr. Joshua Kwabena Siaw ... one of Ghana's most prominent business men\\".  Career  = Teacher = In 1942, aged 19, Siaw became a teacher of Standard One class in Akwaseho. After a couple of months he went to work at the Orthodox Mission School and then to the Bremang Gold Dredging Company near Bogoso, in Ghana's Western Region. After just one month, he went to Effiduase Banko to work again as a teacher from June 1943 to March 1945. Siaw then went to work at the New Juaben Grammar School but left after a year because the headmaster, Mr. Sarkodea, was mismanaging the school. Siaw established Christ College in 1946 with his father, before apprenticing with a pharmacist for a year. Christ College evolved into Ghana Secondary School in Effiduase by 1976. = Cocoa broker = Siaw then decided to go into business and borrowed ¬£50 (¬£1500.00 in 2013 relative value) to start up as a cocoa broker. In four months he had made ¬£600 (¬£18,000.00 in 2013 relative value) profit. In April 1950 he became a siding clerk at Kwahu Praso, transporting cocoa to Accra, Ghana's capital. He repaid the ¬£200 security charge for the clerking employment with interest in six months and was bound for a further six months, by contract, but he decided to stay for only four. In 1953 he worked as a siding clerk, this time for the Cocoa Purchasing Company, which paid ¬£6 a month. He became a cocoa and timber transporter in 1954. = Entrepreneur = In 1957, he began selling enamelware until the Government of Ghana under Kwame Nkrumah banned the importation of those goods. In 1964, Siaw's first request to the government to be granted permission to set up a brewery was rejected. He applied again in 1967 and that application too was rejected on the grounds that licences had been given to Ashanti and Takoradi breweries. Despite being offered an investment of 400,000 cedis from Siaw, Takoradi brewery could not happen.  Tata Brewery  A third application to the government to set up a brewery was successful and approved 26 July 1969.\\"Ghana Breweries Propectus\\", 2 July 1998. The approval was given to \\"Tata Trading Company\\" to establish a brewery in Cape Coast in the Central Region, Ghana, \\"a place of fashion, scholarship, and beauty\\". A suitable site could not be found in Cape Coast and the project was relocated to Achimota, a town on the Accra-Nsawam Road. The new National Redemption Council (NRC) government attempted to renegotiate the competing interests of the state, local businessmen, workers, and foreign capital. Loans and tax incentives were promised to Ghanaian businessmen who went into manufacturing. Tata Brewery Ltd was commissioned on 30 January 1973, Siaw's 50th birthday. It was officially opened by the then Head of State Colonel Ignatius Kutu Acheampong, who said of the event: \\"It is the single- minded and single-handed effort of Mr. J. K. Siaw... which has been responsible for what we see around us today. Mr. Siaw is an excellent example of the innate ability of the Ghanaian to rise to the needs of the occasion\\". Siaw had wanted \\"his Brewery to stand for centuries to come\\", \\"even longer than the famous Christiansborg Castle\\". J. K. Siaw, established Tata Brewery Limited, the first fully Ghanaian-owned brewery in the country. Tata Company secured exclusive export rights for the \\"Maltex\\" drink to neighbouring Togo, Dahomey (Benin), Upper Volta (Burkina Faso), Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Senegal, and The Gambia from Albani Breweries Limited, a Danish firm operating in Ghana. The company was the first brewery to introduce draught beer into the country. The Ghana Commercial Bank provided a loan of 950,000 cedis for the project to begin, with a pre-requisite that Siaw deposited 200,000 cedis. By 1976, the brewery employed 750 Ghanaians and only four expatriates. Siaw produced his own brand of beer - Tata Pilsner Beer. \\"In the country's bid to industrialize, the alcohol industry has played a pioneering role.\\"Emmanuel Akyeampong, \\"The State and Alcohol Revenues: Promoting 'Economic Development' in Gold Coast/Ghana, 1919 to the Present\\", Social History, 1994. = Modern Continental Bank = August 25, 1977 J.K Siaw formed The Modern Continental Bank together with Mr Kwadwo Ohene-Ampofo a legal practitioner. https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qAnayU_gG68C&pg;=PA1&lpg;=PA1&dq;=modern+continental+bank+siaw&source;=bl&ots;=ovJFUQcaC_&sig;=aPsPqBVDNRjvzb5CRO30Pksr34k&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjT_5zMuPXdAhUKIcAKHUqkD-8Q6AEwAXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q;=modern%20continental%20bank%20siaw&f;=false = Philanthropy = For the workers and their families there was a clinic, a subsidised canteen and free transport to work. Siaw sought to build housing for the workers not too far from the site. Vaccinations were provided free of charge to the workers and their families. Siaw presented to the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital an electro-cardiograph, a piece of equipment the hospital was deficient of. Siaw also donated towards the construction of a hospital in Akwaseho in 1975 and begun the building of a road from Akwaseho to Obomeng,George Antwi, \\"Ghana: J. K.

Return of property and compensation issue In the 1990s under the NDC government, successor to the PNDC government and AFRC, Tata Brewery (by then Achimota Brewery Company) was privatised. The International Finance Corporation provided a US$3.5 million loan and a US$1 million equity investment to help finance the US$24.5 million privatization, rehabilitation, and expansion of Achimota Brewery Company (ABC) in Accra, Ghana.

He lectured all over the world, illustrating his talks with lantern slides. He is believed to be the first American to have traveled the entire length of the 2,500-kilometer-long Ming section of the Great Wall of China. He visited the Five Sacred Mountains of China, about which he wrote in The Sacred 5 of China. He came to be considered an expert in Chinese culture and religion.  Early years and education  William Edgar Geil was born on October 1, 1865 in New Britain, Pennsylvania on his family farm. Geil moved to nearby Doylestown, Pennsylvania acquired his education at the public schools, the Doylestown English and Classical Seminary, and Lafayette College, Easton, Pennsylvania, were he attended briefly but never completed graduation. At an early age Geil manifested a deep interest in religious matters and became an earnest and active member of the church. An indefatigable student, he early became thoroughly versed in the Scriptures as well as in most of the important sacred literature, ancient and modern.  Career  = Orator and evangelistic work = Dr. William Edgar Geil, 1898 from the Lake Shore News, Wayne County, New York After leaving college, where he was famous as an orator, he engaged in evangelistic work, with credentials from the Doylestown church, and soon after made several trips to Europe. Geil visited Egypt, the Holy Land, and many of the ancient cities of the Mediterranean. Returning to America, Geil again engaged in evangelistic work. He then began his life work in religion with success and acclaim. He held revival meetings in various parts of New Jersey, New York and New England, and later made a tour of the south and west, addressing meetings of thousands of hearers and making thousands of converts. The Cincinnati Inquirer says of him: \\"His success has been more pronounced than that of any evangelist since Moody;\\" and the \\"Lowell (Mass.) Citizen\\" says that the meetings conducted by him were \\"the most remarkable series of meetings ever held in this city.\\" = Isle of Patmos and Return to the Middle East = In 1896 he made another extended trip abroad, revisiting the Holy Land and its ancient environs, and many of the ancient towns of Asia Minor, and the Mediterranean. Among other points he visited the Isle of Patmos, and on his return wrote and published his book, \\"The Isle that is called Patmos,\\" which reached a sale of many thousands, and was rewritten, enlarged and republished in 1904, after his second visit to the island, in that year. The alarming illness of his mother, to whose early training he says he owes most of his success, called him home in the early part of 1897, and soon after closing the eyes of his beloved parent in her last sleep, on May 2, 1897, he returned to Europe for a brief sojourn and then again took up his work in his native country with increased success.  The Great World Wide Tour  = Purpose = On April 29, 1901, William Edgar Geil left on four- year trip around the world he self dubbed \\"The Great World Wide Tour\\". Geil wanted the United States to observe the state and conditions of missionaries around the world. The Great World Wide Tour's purpose was as best described by his pastor, as an \\"... independent observation of the whole missionary field, in its actual condition, operations, modes of organization, instruction and efforts, its different peculiarities, its needs, its difficulties, its relation to existing heathen religion, to international and denominational policies of political events; and what encouragement or discouragement may exist in the great work of extending the gospel to the world, and especially to the neglected parts of heathendom. A special object is to visit schools, colleges and institutions of sacred learning in connection with missionary operations and report the results to the whole Christian church.\\" During this four-year trip Geil would use photography, notes, and maps to interact with the various peoples and cultures of the world. His three books Ocean and Isle (1902), Yankee on the Yangzte (1904), and A Yankee in Pigmy land ( 1905) would capture his stories and experiences of his travels during the Great World Wide Tour. = Ocean and Isle (1901‚Äì02) = Leaving Philadelphia on April 29, 1901, he crossed the continent to California, and, sailing from the Golden Gate for the Sandwich and South Sea Islands, visiting the Hawaii, Samoa, Fiji, and many other regions in Oceania, and noting their condition and work, as well as the condition and characteristics of their indigenous populations. Geil also focused on the relations between governmental and commercial matters to the propagation of the Gospel of Christ. He proceeded thence to New Zealand, and Australia, reaching Sydney in November 1901, and in Melbourne the following April and May, he organized and participated in the greatest religious revival the continent has ever known, speaking daily to audiences of 3,000 at noon and 10,000 at night during \\"The Great Melbourne Mission\\". The first part of Geil's Great World Wide Tour is described in his book Ocean and Isle. = Yankee on the Yangzte ( Mid 1902 ‚Äì early 1903) = From Australia he proceeded to New Guinea, the Philippines and Japan in late 1901. Throughout 1902, Geil made an extensive trip through China, going up the Yangtze river in a native gunboat, and was carried over the mountains of western China in a bamboo mountain chair. Geil also very visited Manchuria, Korea and Siberia, and later traveled extensively in Burma. While on the Yangtze river, he visited English, American, Australian, and Belgian missionaries in China and also became fascinated with Chinese culture as a whole. On the Chinese people, Geil stated that \\"The better qualities of the Chinese are shown by their ability to do good. There were great charities and benevolent institutions in China before Columbus discovered America\\". The second part of Geil's Great World Wide Tour and his first journey through China along the Yangzte is described in Yankee on the Yangzte. Map of Dr. Geil's journey along the Yangzte River (1902) = Yankee in pigmy land ( Late 1903) = The last part of Geil's Great World Wide Tour was across Africa from Mombassa on the eastern coast to the Pigmy Forest, and thence down the Congo river to the western coast. The journey across equatorial Africa was around 2,500 miles and lasted from June to January 1904. The conclusion of his Great World Wide Tour and description of Geil's time in equatorial Africa can be found in Yankee in pigmy land.

A week later, on March 8, he retained well known Doylestown architect Oscar Martin to design a 30-room concrete mansion. On April 9, Allentown, Pennsylvania contractor Jacob Nagel was awarded the building contract and began construction. The home became known as \\"The Barrens\\". Around that same time, during a lecture in Titusville, Pennsylvania Geil met Lucy Constance Emerson. Constance Emerson was the daughter of Edward Octavius and Lucy Emerson, and was a relative of a relative of Ralph Waldo Emerson.

Geil spent his time lecturing, writing, teaching Sunday School, and life at the Barrens with Constance, entertaining colleagues and guests from Bucks County and all over the world. In November 1924, William and Constance sailed from New York to Palestine to visit the Holy Land. It was Geil's last journey. Dr. Geil's Grave, at Doylestown Cemetery in Doylestown, Pa. On April 11, 1925, at age 60, Dr. William Edgar Geil died in Venice, Italy on his way home, from influenza. Constance Geil resided at the Barrens until her death in 1959, and preserved her husband's library, personal papers, and artifacts. In 1959, following her death, Walter Gustafson of Bucks County purchased the Geil library at public auction held at the Barrens. He preserved Geil's personal library until his death 2005. In 2008, his family donated the collection to the Doylestown Historical Society, where they are permanently housed and preserved today.

In 1928, Bogard successfully pushed for an Arkansas state law which banned the teaching of the theory of evolution in public schools; the law was overturned by the United States Supreme Court in 1968, seventeen years after Bogard's death. He was a chief proponent of the Landmark Baptist movement, which attributes an unbroken continuity and legitimacy to the Baptist Church since Apostolic times. Kentucky background Bogard was the only son of six children born to M. L. and Nancy Bogard in Elizabethtown in central Kentucky. The Bogards were tenant farmers who raised tobacco as their cash crop. In 1873, the Bogards moved to CaseyvilleNot to be confused with Casey County in Central Kentucky in Union County in western Kentucky. There he attended school and the nearby Woodland Baptist Church, still in existence in Morganfield, Kentucky. Young Bogard was also a frequent participant in religious camp meetings. In the spring of 1913, Caseyville was destroyed by an Ohio River flood and not rebuilt. During a church service in February 1885, the teenaged Bogard was baptized in an icy pond, a signal of his faith in Jesus Christ. In 1887 and 1888, he attended Georgetown College in Georgetown, Scott County, north of Lexington, Kentucky. In 1887, he was ordained as a Baptist minister. After Georgetown, he pursued further studies at Bethel College in Russellville, also formerly known as Russellville Male Academy. Located in Logan County in south Kentucky, the institution closed in 1964. Though he was called \\"Dr. Bogard\\", the title was ceremonial. In 1891, Bogard married Lynn Oneida Meacham Owen (1868‚Äì1952), a native of Christian County in southwestern Kentucky, and the widow of Frazier Westley Owen, Jr. (1867‚Äì1889). Both were twenty-three; she had a three-year- old daughter, Lela Owen, who was born in 1888. The Bogards had a son together, Douglas Bogard. From 1892 to 1898, Bogard was the pastor of several churches in Kentucky and Missouri. Theological debates In 1895, while a pastor in Fulton in far southwestern Kentucky,Another Southern Baptist pastor, college founder, and radio evangelist, Monroe E. Dodd of the First Baptist Church of Shreveport, Louisiana, had been a pastor in Fulton, Kentucky, some ten years after Bogard. Bogard edited for two years The Baptist Flag, the first of several denominational papers in his future. In Fulton, he met John Newton Hall, a proponent of the Landmark Baptist movement, which emphasizes a literal interpretation of chapter and verse. Bogard defended Landmarkism in his scholarly writings and in 237 debates between 1908 and 1948, in which he was engaged during his ministerial career. Bogard has been described by his biographer as \\"the personification of polemics, engaging the political, cultural, and religious issues of his day.\\" In his 1934 debate with Aimee Semple McPherson, founder of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, he proclaimed, \\"Miracles and divine healing, as taught and manifested in the Word of God, ceased with the closing of the apostolic age\\" in the year A.D. 70, after which overt miracles were no longer performed on earth. Pentecostals and other charismatic denominations maintain that miracles continue until the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. In 1900, Bogard published through a Baptist press in Louisville, Kentucky, Pillars of Orthodoxy, or Defenders of the Faith, a biographical anthology of important Baptist figures. Bogard was an unyielding critic of ecumenism within the religious community, unwilling to compromise for the sake of unity what he considered unchanging tenets of the faith. In his debate with Church of Christ theologian Joseph Sale Warlick, from John 10:27-30, Bogard argued that a Christian who falls into sinful behavior still retains eternal security because of the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ on the cross and subsequent Resurrection, which are greater than an individual's imperfection. Bogard's critics countered that his view of eternal security conflicts with Ezekiel 33:13: \\"if he trust to his righteousness, and commit iniquity, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered; but in his iniquity that he hath committed, therein shall he die.\\" This verse addresses placing trust in one's individual righteousness instead of sole faith in redemption from Christ. Bogard maintained that the blood of the crucified Christ exonerates the sinner whose salvation is assured at the time of repentance. In 1938, Bogard debated the Church of Christ theologian Nicholas Brodie Hardeman of Henderson, Tennessee, on the nature of the Holy Spirit as the third part of the Trinity and in regard to baptism and falling from grace, the latter which Bogard-style Baptists consider impossible. When Clarence Darrow came to Little Rock to defend Darwinism, Bogard criticized the secularism of the Chicago lawyer but was unable to shake Darrow's confidence in acceptance of the theoretical work of Charles Darwin. Clay Fulks, socialist critic of the conservative order, employed ridicule to deride Bogard: > [Bogard] cravenly permitted the Wicked One [Darrow] to come right into the > fold among his flock -- and maybe devour some of his little ewe lambs! ... > Brother Ben, you cannot hope to escape the consequences of your > pusillanimous negligence by hiding behind the times. ... [God] probably sent > the ogre Darrow down to Little Rock just to try your faith. Then you had > your opportunity. But instead of rising to it nobly, as Calvin rose to his > when God sent Servetus to Geneva, you cowered in the background and failed > ignominiously. Now you whine about the times.\\" Though Bogard would presumably have mostly agreed on matters of faith and biblical interpretation with J. Frank Norris, the controversial Baptist fundamentalist figure from Fort Worth, he claimed that Norris was vain and prone to exaggerate Norris' ministerial success. Though he accused Norris of failing to preach the fundamentals of the faith, the two in time developed a begrudging friendship. Bogard said, \\"When I get to heaven I expect to find Frank Norris there in spite of that wicked streak that runs through him.\\" Norris accepted and publicly defended premillennial dispensationism, an eschatological perspective with which Bogard disagreed even though it found traction in the American Baptist Association, which Bogard had organized. In 1941, Norris faced a $25,000 libel judgment rendered in San Antonio, Texas, payable to another Baptist minister, R. E. White, because of remarks about White in a Detroit, Michigan, denominational paper, The Fundamentalist. The publicity about the suit weakened Norris' hold over his fellow fundamentalists.\\"Norris appeal in libel suit denied\\", Sweetwater Reporter (Sweetwater, Texas), Vol. 45, No. 150, Ed. 1 (November 12, 1941) Bogard taught that since the time of Jesus on earth there has been a succession of churches teaching the Missionary Baptist view of Scripture even if those churches had been called by other names. Some refer to this teaching as \\"the faith once delivered unto the saints.\\" Christ spoke of establishing His church and \\"the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\\" Missionary Baptists, like other denominations too, believe that their denomination is that original church. Arkansas years In 1901, Bogard became the editor and half-owner of the Arkansas Baptist newspaper. Three years later, he secured editorial control of the publication. In 1905, he left the Southern Baptist Convention to become for nineteen years, as it developed, an Independent Baptist. Nearly two decades later, he worked to establish the ABA, or the Missionary Baptist denomination, which dispatches missionaries not through an associational body like the SBC authorizes but through individual churches. In 1899, Bogard came to Arkansas. For his first four years there, he was the pastor of First Baptist Church in Searcy in White County near the capital city of Little Rock. Between 1903 and 1909, he was the pastor of First Baptist Church in Argenta, now North Little Rock in Pulaski County. Then he preached independently in revivals and crusades in seven states. In 1914, he moved to Texarkana in Miller County, Arkansas, where he founded The Baptist Commoner. In 1917, he merged The Baptist Commoner with the Arkansas Baptist to create The Baptist and Commoner. In 1920, he assumed his final pastorate at Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in Little Rock, where he remained until retirement in 1947. At the time, no Missionary Baptist pastor earned more than the $100 gross monthly salary paid to Bogard by Antioch Church.Billy Hathorn, \\"Austin Toliver Powers and Leander Louis Clover: Planting the American Baptist Association in Northwest Louisiana during the Middle 20th Century,\\" North Louisiana History, Vol. XLI (Summer-Fall 2010), p. 133 During the 1920s, Bogard joined the Ku Klux Klan, which targeted in that phase of its existence foreigners and Roman Catholics. Bogard claimed that the theory of evolution had contributed to the moral decline of the United States. In 1926, Bogard joined with Doss Nathan Jackson to write Evolution: Unscientific and Unscriptural, which claims that Darwin's's theory causes discouraged persons to turn to atheism and Bolshevism. Bogard and Jackson subsequently broke fellowship when Jackson's father-in-law, C. A. Gilbert, the chairman of the Missionary Baptist Sunday School Committee, was blamed for a deficit. For a decade Bogard tried to remove Gilbert as the committee chairman. In 1950, Jackson left the Missionary Baptist denomination and started the Baptist Missionary Association of America, formerly the North American Baptist Association. In 1927, the Arkansas State Senate tabled an anti-evolution bill. Bogard led a petition drive to place the issue on the ballot as Initiated Act No. 1 in the general election held on November 6, 1928. In the campaign Bogard unexpectedly found himself defending the right of free speech of Charles Lee Smith, the founder and president of the since defunct American Association for the Advancement of Atheism who opposed the initiated act and had been charged with blasphemy while distributing atheist literature in Little Rock.Tom Flynn, ed., \\"Blasphemy\\" in The New Encyclopedia of Unbelief (New York City: Prometheus Books, 2007), p. 147 Bogard was convinced that his conservative ideas would prove superior to those of Smith in an honest forum. Arkansas voters defied their state senators and passed the anti-evolution act by a two-to-one margin and also supported the Democratic presidential nominee Al Smith, the governor of New York, though Bogard had been among the southern clergy who opposed this first ever Catholic nominee of a major party despite U.S. Senator Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas being tapped as Smith's vice-presidential running mate. Even before the term civil rights was widely used, Bogard believed that Al Smith as president would work for equality of African Americans in the still racially segregated American South. Though successful in Arkansas, the Smith- Robinson ticket was defeated by the Republican Hoover-Curtis slate. Later years In 1931, Bogard resigned as editor of The Baptist and Commoner. Three years later he launched another denominational newspaper, The Orthodox Baptist Searchlight. Through the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in Little Rock, Bogard worked to establish the Missionary Baptist Seminary in that city. He became the original dean of the seminary while remaining as the Antioch pastor. Conrad N. Glover (1895‚Äì1986) was the first seminary president, with J. Louis Guthrie as vice president. The seminary observed its eightieth anniversary in 2014; it is housed in current facilities at 5224 Stagecoach Road, which opened in 1979. The seminary filled the void left by the closing of the undergraduate institution, Missionary Baptist College, which had operated from 1919 to 1934 in Sheridan. Conrad Glover, a Sheridan native, had also been an administrator at Missionary Baptist College. Honors In 1901, he received an honorary Doctor of Divinity from the then Southwest Bible College in Bolivar in Polk County in southwestern Missouri. He subsequently received an honorary degree from the since disbanded Missionary Baptist College in Sheridan in Grant County in southern Arkansas. Bogard died at his Little Rock home at the age of eighty-three and is interred at Roselawn Memorial Park at 2801 Asher Avenue in Little Rock. He left his estate to Missionary Baptist Seminary and the Bogard Press, named in his honor, operated by the Baptist Bookstore at 4605 North State Line Avenue in Texarkana, Texas. Seminary students took up a collection to buy Bogard a headstone, for he left no funds for that purpose. Mrs. Bogard died on March 17, 1952, ten months after her husband's passing and is interred beside him. Daughter Lela is interred at Calvary Cemetery in Little Rock; her date of death reads, November 2, 1966. As of 2013, Ben Bogard's son Douglas Bogard had long been deceased, no further information having been located. Four of Bogard's radio sermons have been preserved via the Internet at: http://www.discoverthewordwithdrjim.com/audio/sermonseries.php?series=7 In 2006, Luther D. Perdue extracted a large collection of Bogard sermons and lessons between 1915 and 1937: https://archive.is/20130805023134/http://jrhenness4.home.comcast.net/~jrhenness4/calhac/bogard/1-index.htm In addition to Pillars of Orthodoxy, or Defenders of the Faith, Bogard wrote the following books: *Fifty-two Bible Lesson (1930) *Smith-Bogard Debate: A Discussion between Eugene S. Smith and Ben M. Bogard (1942) *The Baptist Way- Book (1946) *The Golden Key (1968 reprint) *Best of Bogard Sermons (1974 reprint) *W. Curtis Porter and Ben M.

He spent much of his life living in and visiting various countries around the world. He began painting as a child while living as a refugee in the Mexican embassy in Germany. Icaza exhibited his work both in Mexico and abroad in Europe, South America, the Middle East, Asia and India, most notably at his three major solo exhibitions at the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City. He also painted a mural dedicated to Bertolt Brecht, La Far√°ndula, at the Casino de la Selva in Cuernavaca, a focus of controversy when the work was moved and restored in the early 2000s. He painted additional murals for the Mexican Pavilion at the HemisFair in Texas (Urban Flowers); for the Mexican Pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal, Canada (Canto al Barroco Maya); and for the Mexican Pavilion in Osaka (Repressive Computers) at Expo '70. This last mural is held at the Museo de Arte Abstracto Manuel Felgu√©rez in Zacatecas City. He was an active member of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana and also a member and founder of several important Mexican artistic movements including Los Interioristas (Nueva Presencia), El Sal√≥n Independiente, and La Confrontaci√≥n 66. Early life Icaza was born in the Mexican embassy in San Salvador on 5 October 1930, the son of a well known diplomat. Much of his childhood was spent in Germany during the rise of the Nazis. As he spent much time alone as a child, he began painting. His youth was very nomadic, as his family travelled to countries in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and America. A stay in Madrid exposed Icaza to the works of European masters. After a year of studying political science at the University of Leuven, he decided to study painting at the Brussels Academy of Fine Arts. In 1951, he moved to New York at the invitation of the Mexican painter Rufino Tamayo, whom he studied with. While in New York, Icaza also worked as a photography director. At the age of 25, he returned to Mexico and married Concepci√≥n Solana Morales. They had five children: Francisco, Miguel, Pablo, Concha and Teresa. In his early years in Mexico City, he continued studying the art of painting under Antonio Rodr√≠guez Luna, and considered him to be one of his primary teachers. From the 1950s to 1968 Icaza remained in Mexico, but the political turmoil following the Tlatelolco massacre caused him to leave Mexico again, not returning permanently until 1990. During that time he lived or spent time in the United States, Guatemala, Colombia, Spain and the United Kingdom. Career Icaza began his career in 1947 with his first teacher, an Armenian painter and refugee, at the Mediterranean coast in Lebanon, where Icaza swore before the Olympic gods that the rest of his life would be dedicated to painting. In 1961, Icaza founded an artist group called Los Interioristas or Nueva Presencia with painter Arnold Belkin. In 1968, he formed the Sal√≥n Independiente along with Vicente Rojo Almaz√°n and Manuel Felgu√©rez. In his life, Icaza worked in many mediums and formats. Icaza painted a mural at the Casino de la Selva for the theater renovated by the architect F√©lix Candela. The mural, La Far√°ndula was dedicated to Bertolt Brecht as an apology for the world of clowns and actors, inspired by The Threepenny Opera. Other murals created by Icaza include: Computadoras Represoras, for the Mexican Pavilion at Osaka, Japan; Canto al Barroco Maya, for the Mexican Pavilion at Montreal Canad√°; and Urban Flowers for the Mexican Pavilion at Hemisfair in Houston, Texas. Icaza also created a monumental sculpture dedicated to the muralist painter Jos√© Clemente Orozco. Icaza was a prolific easel oil painter and a prolific drawer with ink, gouache and water color. Icaza also published several books, including La Fiera Malvada (1971), Me quiero ir al mar (1985), and Llegando a puerto en sentido contrario. Icaza rejected the commercialization of art but admitted that an artist needs to live from his work, taking advantage of different opportunities. Despite his strong criticism of the Mexican government during his life, he felt no contradiction in taking grants from official sources, saying that the arts of a country are always their best things to show to the world, and he is part of that. His government affiliations have included a position as a cultural attach√© for the Mexican embassy in Colombia . In 1993, he received a special grant from CONACULTA to return to Mexico and paint in oils full-time, after his work on drawings that expressed his wishes to \\"leave by the sea\\" (Me quiero ir al mar). Icaza's work has been exhibited in various venues in Mexico and abroad. Major exhibitions during his lifetime include the Museo de Arte Moderno (1979, 1981 and 1998), the Phoenix Art Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego. In 2011, he had an exhibition at the Galer√≠a Machado in Mexico City, sponsored by CONACULTA. The Museo de Arte Moderno holds several of Icaza's works. Icaza was a member of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana and an active member of Sal√≥n Independiente and the movement Confrontaci√≥n 66. Later life and death In the early 2000s, Icaza was involved in a controversy related to his mural installed at the Casino de la Selva in Cuernavaca. In 2001, the Costco group bought the former casino to build new facilities, a move whose validity Icaza questioned. He protested the sale and the plan to restore his and other murals. The project went ahead, but the artists were not permitted to see the restoration work. After the murals were shown to the public in their new location in 2004, Icaza and other artists denounced the works as copies or fakes, claiming the originals were destroyed. He was married to Tony Marc√≠n for 24 years and lived in Mexico until his death. Icaza died at the age of 83 in Mexico City on the afternoon of 3 May 2014. Artistry Icaza has been classified as part of the Generaci√≥n de la Ruptura, the art movement that followed Mexican muralism. He had social content in his work, that reflected his socialist ideals, much like the muralists; however his painting was not a communication with the masses. He experimented with a wide range of themes and techniques. His production had marked periods, from neo figuration to criticism and from there to works that recall the ancient cultures as humorous and satirical recurrences. Following the line of the Interiorists, he painted self-portraits revelatory of his own state of mind. He produced a series of oil paintings and drawings of prostitutes and the Lumpenproletariat that shows influence from German Expressionism and symbolist painter James Ensor . The artist states that while he has changed styles and techniques, elements of expressionism remain constant in his work, stating ‚ÄúWhen I draw I try to transmit my obsessions as a thinking being, as a vital part of the 20th century; my usual themes are life and death.‚Äù Icaza produced gouaches, engravings and drawings conceived in book form such as La fiera malvada, Animales m√≠ticos, Breve historia de una mano juguetona, El viaje er√≥tico, Sancho escuchando la lectura del Quijote, Me quiero ir al Mar and Llegando a puerto en sentido contrario. The images here were not conceived as illustrations for texts rather he invented arguments and used a language of ideographs with have a similarity to symbolism and surrealism. The artist spoke multiple languages and was a devout reader of Albert Camus. He was a friend of Ray Bradbury and Aldous Huxley and admirer of Jos√© Clemente Orozco, all of whom affected his work, as well as his political ideas, which were strongly socialist and did not changed over his life. Icaza was well-versed in contemporary and past artistic movements, and also had ample knowledge of ancient cultures and the literatures of various countries and epochs. The artist stated he was fascinated by codices and other historical works that take advantage of signs and images to convey their meaning. Legacy In 2019, a retrospective exhibition of 145 of Icaza's works was presented by the Museo del Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City, titled \\"Francisco Icaza: me quiero ir al mar.\\" Further reading *\\"Contemporary Mexican Painting in a Time of Change\\" by Shifra M.

He is often referred in Sydney's dining circles as the \\"Guru of Indian cuisine\\". He is recognised for introducing authentic Indian cuisine to the Australian public with his restaurant, Abhi's in 1990. Following the success of Abhi's he opened his second restaurant Aki's at Sydney's prestigious dining precinct 'The Finger Wharf Woolloomooloo'. Aki's carried the accolades for Chef Kumar, being the only Indian restaurant to win the coveted 'Chef Hat' award for consecutive years since 2011 till present.  Early life  Kumar Mahadevan was raised in Tirunelveli, a town in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. He was brought up in a typical Hindu Brahmin joint family, consisting of his grandmother, her three sons, their wives and children. His father was a steel merchant. Kumar got his first taste for Indian cuisine in his mother's kitchen, at a very young age. He names his grandmother as his biggest culinary influence, crediting his sense of smell as something he inherited from her. When he was eight, she taught him to make rasam, a subtle but complex lentil soup, that's a staple in every Southern Indian meal.  Training and early cooking career  Kumar Mahadevan started an economics degree at the University of Madras at the age of 16, but dropped out a month later, when his family's fortunes fell. He then joined Madras Catering College, on the suggestion of a friend. Though granted a full scholarship for the three-year course, Kumar struggled to convince his parents as they expected him to pursue an academic discipline. At the end of his first year, Kumar got a summer job at the five-star The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai. Kumar signed up for double and triple shifts, working for eighteen days consecutively, while commuting from his aunt's place, an hour and a half away. Starting out in butchery, he continued to work in every department under Cyrus Todiwala, a Parsi chef who now runs London's Cafe Spice Namaste. He graduated in 1979. Kumar went back for his apprenticeship at the Taj, completing it in half the time. In 1981, when offered a higher salary, Kumar left for Basrah in Iraq, to work at the new Sheraton. With the Iran-Iraq war worsening and having helped to settle his father's debts, he returned to Mumbai in 1984.  Career  Kumar went to Australia in 1985, to work in a joint venture by The Tea Board of India and Air India ‚Äì the Mayur restaurant in Sydney, cooking for the likes of Elton John, Mick Jagger and the King of Bahrain. He worked 96-hour weeks over six days for meagre pay and had signed a four-year contract, with a clause that stated that if he left, his parents will have to pay a huge fine. Kumar got married in July 1987, and his wife followed him to Sydney. But, the long hours and the low wages started to take a toll on Kumar, and he was desperate to leave. He came close to walking out in 1988, when he was forced to return to the kitchen within hours of his son's birth. Luck intervened, when Mayur's finances fell and Kumar was suddenly freed from his contract. Kumar joined Sorrentino cafe in Sydney's Circular Quay in 1989. He became friends with the owner, Doug Moxon and they decided to open an Indian restaurant together. They found a place in North Strathfield and in 1990, Abhi's, named after his first son Abhinav, opened. In 1991, his second son Akilesh was born. In spite of receiving good feedback, Kumar and his wife struggled to make ends meet for the next few years.  Success  In 1994, Les Luxford, the food critic at The Sydney Morning Herald stumbled upon Abhi's, on his way back from a business meeting and soon published a positive review with the headline, \\"The Search is Over\\" in April 1994. Abhi's became an overnight success and in Kumar's own words, 'there were queues down the street'. When it got really busy, Kumar asked his wife, Suba to help in the restaurant in the evenings. Abhi's has since gone on to become an iconic neighbourhood eatery and culinary institution of Indian Gastronomy continuing on their 28th year still pulling large crowds. The more ambitious operation, Aki's (named after his second son), was opened in November 2003 on the newly restored Woolloomooloo Finger Wharf. This was a chance for Kumar to exhibit Indian Cuisine at the next level with traditional flavours with a contemporary twist. It aims to give the customers a fine-dining experience in Indian cuisine. Both his restaurants highlights Kumar Mahadevan's handling of clever flavours and fresh, fragrant spices in a modern interpretation of traditional desi food. Kumar enjoys creating dishes that combine authentic flavours of South India, with the best seafood and other local produce of Australia ‚Äì an approach that has gained him a huge fan following.

He refers to her as his greatest inspiration and at times, his greatest critic. Since the success of Abhi's in 1994, she has helped Kumar with the running of both the restaurants. They have two sons Abhinav (born 1988) and Akilesh (born 1991), after whom Kumar named both his restaurants. His other passions are photography, wine and travel. Every year, the couple visit their native place for inspiration. Kumar loves rediscovering yesteryear recipes by visiting cooks and housewives, refining their traditional style and integrating it into the food at Abhi's and Aki's. Kumar credits his friend and chef, Praveen Anand (an acclaimed Indian chef and founder of Dakshin restaurant in Chennai), as a constant source of inspiration and influence on his continuing education on both the historic and contemporary aspects of Indian food.  Books  In 2013, Kumar and Suba Mahadevan co-authored a book titled From India: food, family & tradition. The book presents traditional and modern recipes alongside their personal story of arranged marriage, international adventures and their ultimate move to Australia. Recipes are arranged according to the tastes ‚Äì ‚Äòsour‚Äô, ‚Äòsweet‚Äô, ‚Äòsalt‚Äô, ‚Äòbitter‚Äô and ‚Äòspice‚Äô, perhaps a nod to the Vedic concept of six tastes.

The distillery is located in a converted sawmill in Milltown on the outskirts of Dingle, in a Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking region) in the southwest of Ireland. The first whiskeys distilled and matured at the distillery were released in late 2016. In addition to whiskey, the distillery also produces and markets Dingle vodka and Dingle Gin. In 2017, Dingle Distillery became the first independent Irish distillery to release a single pot still whiskey in several decades. To meet growing demand, the distillery has announced plans to double spirit production in 2018. Background The Irish whiskey industry suffered a period of severe decline in the 20th century, which saw most of Ireland's distilleries close, and those remaining in operation amalgamating under the ownership of a single company, Irish Distillers, in the 1970s. However, since then, Ireland's whiskey industry has undergone a resurgence, in particular since 2010, with a diversification of both output and ownership. With the number of operating distilleries in the country having fallen to just two in the 1980s, Ireland now boasts sixteen operating distilleries, with many others planned. When it opened, the Dingle Distillery was Ireland's fifth, joining the New Midleton Distillery (where Jameson, Powers and Paddy are produced, among others), Bushmills, Kilbeggan. History The initiative to start a distillery in Dingle was that of the now deceased Oliver Hughes, who was also a founder of the Porterhouse brewing and restaurant group. The site, formerly the Fitzgerald sawmill, was converted for whiskey production in 2012, opening on 29 November. The distillery was reported to have created 25 jobs, with more anticipated with the launch of a visitors' centre. The new copper pot stills used at the distillery were designed by John McDougall. As a promotion to attract investors, Dingle Distillery offered the first five hundred special casks to investors \\"Founding Fathers\\", to be ready for bottling from November 2017. Products Using pot stills the distillery produces two casks of whiskey per day in Dingle, where the mildly cool climate is reportedly favourable for whiskey production. Under Irish law, to be termed whiskey, a spirit is legally required to be matured for at least three years. Therefore, Dingle Distillery only brought whiskey to market in late 2016. The distillery also has a still for the production of gin and vodka. As of 2017, 100,000 bottles per year of Dingle gin are being sold. The first batch of whiskey was released in late 2016, and consisted of two tripled distilled whiskeys, both of which were matured solely in bourbon casks: * Dingle Single Malt Whiskey, 46.5% (7,500 bottles) * Dingle Single Malt Whiskey Cask Strength, 60.7% (500 bottles) The second batch, released in 2017, consisted of four different bottlings, three single malts and a single pot still whiskey: * Dingle Pot Still Whiskey, 46.5% (800 bottles) - Matured exclusively in Pedro Ximenez casks. * Dingle Single Malt Whiskey, 46.5% (6,000 bottles) - Matured in Pedro Ximenez and Oloroso sherry casks, as well as bourbon casks. * Dingle Single Malt Whiskey Cask Strength, 60.2% (500 bottles) - Matured in bourbon, Oloroso and Pedro Ximinez casks. * Dingle Single Malt Whiskey Cask Strength, 46.5% (700 bottles) - Matured in a marriage of port and bourbon casks.

History of the house  =After the dissolution of Abbey Cwm Hir= The township of Cefnyberen was part of the Monastic Grange of Gwernago in Kerry that was owned by the Cistercian Abbey of Cwm Hir in Radnorshire. Until the Abbey was dissolved in 1536/7 it seems that the township formed part of a forested area stretching northwards to Cefn y Coed in Llandyssil. At the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries the lands of Gwernago were purchased by Sir John Williams, Baron Williams of Thame, who fought with Henry Tudor at Bosworth. He was an immensely rich and important person, dying at Ludlow Castle on 14 October 1559, when he was Lord President of the Marches. He was Keeper of the Jewels to Henry VIII and was a close associate to Thomas Cromwell in the dissolution of the Monasteries and the sequestration of their property, becoming Treasurer of the Court of Augmentations.http://www.berkshirehistory.com/bios/jwilliams_bwoft.html.

A fragmentary document, apparently referring to the purchase of the grange by Lord Williams, 'which is well known and meared and lies in the township of Gwenago' and also refers to lands in the other townships, including Keven y Berren, where Lord Williams had acquired lands. This purchase included the Grange of Gwernago and there is a long description of ‚ÄúCoed Kyrye ap heren‚Äù, which is almost certainly the forest of Cefnyberen. This gives a fairly exact acreage describing the various trees and the part of the area was regarded as common land.

Possessions of the abbot and convent of Cwmhir in Kerry, Montgomeryshire Collections 27 , 1893 pp.81‚Äì91, When Baron Williams died 1559 his will instructed that the Gwernago should be sold to pay off debts. Cefnyberen is not included in the sale and it appears to have been sold earlier to a John ap R(ees), who was paying in 1534‚Äì35 a rent of ¬£8 8s, and who may have been the abbot‚Äôs bailiff at Gwernago.‚ÄùRowley Morris‚Äù, pg83 =John ap Rees and the Pryce Family= A considerable amount is known about John ap Rees and his descendants, whose surname became Pryce.Lewys Dwnn ‚ÄúHeraldic Visitations of Wales and Part of the Marches‚Äù Edited by Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, Welsh MSS Society, Llandovery 1846, reprinted Bridge Books , Wrexham 2005, Vol I, 298 He came originally from Ednop in Shropshire, in Mainstone parish, near Clun; which at that time would have been a Welsh speaking area. John ap Rees must be considered the most likely builder of Great Cefnyberen, as his dates most closely match the dendrochronological dates of 1545‚Äì1566 for the building of the house.

Knott, C.S.D. Christian Science Endtime Center. Retrieved August 11, 2013 Her father was a cousin of the founders of the Macmillan Publishing Company, Daniel and his brother Alexander Macmillan. Her family emigrated to Ontario, Canada when she was a girl and she grew up there. In 1876, she was married to Kennard Knott. In 1878, they moved to England, where he had been born. While in the London area and acting on a long-held desire to help the sick, she did volunteer work in local hospitals, although she was herself in poor health with bronchitis and other ailments. She began investigating alternatives to medicine, such as homeopathy. In 1881, her little boy died while under the care of a doctor who was a grandson of Samuel Hahnemann, founder of homeopathy.Tyner (2010), pp. 94‚Äì96 In January 1882, Knott and her daughters, aged two and four, emigrated to Chicago, where her husband had already relocated. They soon had another child, a boy. One afternoon, when this child was approaching his second birthday, Knott heard him screaming in the kitchen and discovered he'd swallowed much of a bottle of disinfectant, carbolic acid. Doctors arrived shortly and said they didn't expect him to survive and if he did, he'd never be able to swallow normally. Desperate for help, she turned to Christian Science. The child was soon relieved from pain and the next morning, recovered completely, helping himself to an apple he found in the pantry. The experience changed Knott. She had already purchased the Christian Science textbook and had been reading it; after the experience with her son, she began a more intensive study of the book, during which she found her health improving. She then began offering to help others. She also had primary class instruction with a Bradford Sherman, a student of Eddy's. Around this time, her husband abandoned the family. In 1885, having friends in Detroit, Michigan, Knott and her children moved there from Chicago. In 1887 and 1888, she had class instruction with Mary Baker Eddy,Tyner (2010), pp. 97‚Äì100 who had founded the Christian Science church based upon what she called her discovery of the \\"Science of the Christ.\\" She was given the certificate C.S.D. As a Christian Science practitioner and teacher, and from 1889 to April 1895, pastor, she became a prominent resident of Detroit and was invited to be one of the people, mostly men, to write letters for the Detroit Century Box, a time capsule organized by the mayor, William C.

It includes about eight species native to the southern and southeastern United States.Leavenworthia. Flora of North America. They are known generally as gladecresses.Leavenworthia. USDA PLANTS.Leavenworthia. Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS). Description Leavenworthia exigua from Central Tennessee showing characteristic siliques. These are small annual herbs under 10 centimeters tall.Beck, J. B., et al. (2006). Leavenworthia (Brassicaceae) revisited: testing classic systematic and mating system hypotheses. Systematic Botany 31(1), 151-59. They produce a basal rosette of leaves and often lack a true stem, instead sending up a scape, a flowering stalk topped with an inflorescence. The inflorescence is usually made up of just one flower, but a large plant may produce several flowers in a raceme. The petals are white, yellow, orange, or lavender. They are often notched and clawed, narrow at the base and wider at the tip. There are six stamens, two short and four long. The fruits are siliques or silicles of various shapes. The seeds are flattened and have wide margins or wings. Ecology Leavenworthia species are mainly restricted to habitats with limestone substrates, especially cedar glades.Baskin, J. M. and C. C. Baskin. (1978). The rarity of Leavenworthia uniflora, with special reference to its occurrence in Kentucky. Castanea 43(1) 54-57. These glades can be very wet in winter and spring, even flooded. Several species are narrow endemics in terms of geography; L. alabamica and L. crassa are endemic to Alabama, L. aurea to Oklahoma, L. stylosa to Tennessee, and L. texana to Texas. Breeding systems The mating systems found in genus Leavenworthia have been studied extensively because they are variable and have changed several times in the evolutionary history of the group. Some species are self-compatible, while others are self-incompatible. L. exigua, L. torulosa, and L. uniflora are self-compatible, able to produce seed from ovules fertilized by their own pollen. In L. alabamica and L. crassa, separate populations of self-compatible and self-incompatible individuals have been observed. At at least three points in the history of Leavenworthia there have been transitions between mating systems, in which self-incompatible plants evolved self-compatibility, developing the ability to fertilize their own ovules. This process has inspired studies of the genetics of the genus, which may help explain how such changes occurred. Self-incompatibility is the ancestral state of the genus, and it has been lost several times.Busch, J. W. (2005). The evolution of self-compatibility in geographically peripheral populations of Leavenworthia alabamica (Brassicaceae). American Journal of Botany 92(9), 1503-12. The transition from self-incompatibility to self- compatibility is described as the loss of a barrier, rather than the gain of a new function; in L. alabamica, for example, a mutation in a pollen gene may have led to the production of compatible pollen.Chantha, S. C., et al. (2013). Secondary evolution of a self-incompatibility locus in the Brassicaceae genus Leavenworthia. PLoS Biology 11(5), e1001560. Self-compatible plants are also shaped differently, with smaller flowers in which the pollen-bearing anthers are positioned closer to the stigma.

Early life and education Lord was born in Burlington, Iowa. His father was a bookbinder at the Leopold Desk Company in Burlington. Aldo Leopold, a scientist and writer, was his uncle. At high school, Lord was the school's newspaper editor. He became a tennis single champ in 1937 and 1938. Lord attended Grinnell College. Career After graduation, Lord joined the military and worked for a news organization of the military community. A magazine called Weekend which he bought with a partner failed, and he was fired from Cosmopolitan magazine. Therefore, in 1951, he founded his own business, a literary shop in New York City. In 1952, he launched his literary agency. Kerouac entrusted him with his novel On the Road, and after more than four years Viking Press bought and published it. Lord has said that being male gave him an advantage in the female-dominated world of literary agents, being knowledgeable in the sports scene. He represented authors writing about boxing and baseball for example, as well as newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin, Kesey with One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, or political figures John Sirica and Robert McNamara. In 2013, Open Road published Lord's memoir Lord of Publishing. Frank Deford, a sportswriter and novelist, was his client and in a promotion for Lord's memoir, stated, \\"He's a giant.\\" In 2015, the city of Burlington held its first Sterling Lord Writers and Readers Festival to honor him. In April 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, Lord was profiled among other senior New Yorkers in the New York Times. The article reported that Lord was living in a Lower Manhattan home for seniors, and he was starting a new literary agency at 99 years old. One author represented by his agency was Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Personal life Lord first married a French woman and divorced, just as three more. He had one daughter. As of 2015, aged 94, he had not visited Burlington since 1977, as relatives and friends have died.

The convention was held from June 9, 1885 until August 3, 1885 in Tallahassee, Florida \\"for the purpose of reforming the \\"Carpetbag\\" Constitution of 1868\\", according to course literature from the University of Virginia. It was Florida's fifth constitutional convention and restored the election of many public officials, reduced the salaries of the governor and other state officers, made the governor ineligible for reelection, abolished the office of lieutenant governor, and provided for a legislature of fixed numbers. The agreed-upon constitution added a residency requirement, forbade a second consecutive term for the office of governor, made the cabinetIt is not the Governor's Cabinet. The Cabinet established under the 1885 Constitution consisted of independent officials elected on a statewide basis who, along with the governor, shared the executive authority of the state.

Allen Morris' The Florida Handbook (1981-1982 ed.) at 110. elected instead of appointed, and made many state and local offices elective. It also gave the legislature the option of requiring the payment of a poll tax as a requirement for voting (Article VI, Section 8).\\"The Legislature shall have power to make the payment of the capitation tax a prerequisite for voting, and all such taxes received shall go into the school fund.\\" Fla. Const. of 1885, art. VI, s.8 This was a compromise between smaller \\"black belt\\" counties who wanted more offices elected and those from larger and more prosperous counties. The poll tax disenfranchised African-Americans, and anyone else too poor to pay the tax. Racial segregation in schools was mandatory (Article XII, Section 12).Governor Leroy Collins, Prologue to Walter L. Smith, The Magnificent Twelve: Florida's Black Junior Colleges, Winter Park, Florida, FOUR-G Publishers, 1994, , p. xvi. The constitution also prohibited marriage between \\"a white person and a person of negro descent\\" (Article XVI, Section 24). The constitution ratified at the convention passed with a vote of 31,804 to 21,243. It was \\"the model\\" of Florida's government until 1968 and \\"represented the regression to racial discrimination which was occurring throughout the South in the post-Reconstruction period.\\"\\"Rise And Fall of the Slave South,\\" University of Virginia The Constitution was weighted in favor of counties. Each new county was entitled to one to three representatives according to population. Every ten years the lower house was automatically reconstructed on a basis of these members for each of the five largest counties, two members for each of the next eighteen, and one for each remaining county. In 1930, the big counties of the time, containing Florida‚Äôs largest cities, Jacksonville, Tampa, and Miami, had a combined population of 451,977, and had nine representatives and three senators. The four smallest counties had a combined of population of only 30,000, but had four representatives and three senators. This overrepresentation of rural, conservative areas led to increasing tension in twentieth-century Florida politics, as central and then south Florida grew. It was a major factor leading to the current Constitution of 1968, which changed apportionment.  Delegates  * Henry C. Baker - Nassau * Thomas N. Bell - Hamilton * William A.

Inspired by the darkwave and punk-funk sounds and emotions of British post-punk bands like Joy Division, Gang Of Four, A Certain Ratio. They were also influenced by the Jamaican rhythms and politically charged environment that was their new home, the band set about writing angular, moody songs that fused Lowery's dark lyrical pre- occupations with Clift's ringing, textured guitar chord phrasing. Joined by fellow North-Eastern transplants Peter Balmer on bass and drummer Bruce Archibald, the band began playing shows on the London live circuit opening for The Carpettes. By December, they had recorded four songs at Alaska Studios in Waterloo, two of which became their first singles. \\"Everything Is Temporary\\" b/w \\"Silent Scream\\" was released in March 1980 on their own Clever Metal label with help from super-indie Rough Trade. Features in fanzines like Allied Propaganda, Panache, ZigZag and No Class followed. They quickly gained a regular audience at legendary venues like The Rock Garden in the West End and The Moonlight Club in West Hampstead. In early 1980, Archibald quit the band and was replaced by Alan Cole. More shows followed, and soon enough, Lowery's often explosive onstage presence and the band's newly found confidence and angular songwriting had captured the attention of Malicious Damage, a label and management operation in West London that had already released music by Killing Joke and Red Beat. In June 1980, this new partnership produced the second single \\"Agent Orange\\" b/w \\"Driving\\". Largely inspired by the film 'Apocalypse Now', Lowery's lyrics referenced the defoliant used in the Vietnam War and the song itself was built around a pulsing 3-note bassline, guitar harmonics and a metronomic beat. Synthesizer atmospherics on the track were provided by Killing Joke's Jaz Coleman. The single was released later in 1980 and became their best known song. In 1981, Peter Balmer had left to join Fad Gadget and was replaced by bassist Francis Cook. The band set about recording their one and only session for the BBC's John Peel show. Three tracks \\"Cut\\", \\"Extinguish\\" and \\"Where The Buffalo Roam\\" were broadcast on 19 January and repeated again later that year. A third and final single \\"Cut\\" b/w \\"Faith in Transition\\" was released on Malicious Damage in early Summer. The band's final recording session, in April 1981, with engineer Mark Lusardi yielded three new songs: \\"Version Of A Life\\", \\"Extinguish\\" and \\"Concrete Eternal\\", none of which were ever commercially released, as the band finally fell apart in August. Ian Lowery went on to form Folk Devils, while Nick Clift went to work for Rough Trade. Clift and Lowery re-united briefly in the second incarnation of Folk Devils in 1986, recording the EP \\"The Best Protection\\" for Beggars Banquet's Situation 2 label.

Pryor Creek's history in the 1800s, before its official incorporation. It was initially called Coo-y-yah, in Indian Territory, but was later named Pryor Creek. In 1951, voters approved the city's charter, giving it a mayor-council system of government. 2010, the United States Census has recorded its population as 9,539. 19th century The Osage people were present in the northeastern region of what would become the U.S. state of Oklahoma as early as 1750.Burns, Lewis F. OSAGE , Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. (accessed August 5, 2013) Later settlements would locate in former Osage village and campsites because the sites and the trails between them were already cleared. In the early 1800s, treaties with the Cherokee, Osage, and Choctaw gave the tribes allotments in Indian Territory in the region that would become Oklahoma.Everett, Dianna. \\"INDIAN TERRITORY ,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture.

The earliest school, church and white cemetery in present-day Oklahoma were created with the mission, which was established 5 miles southeast of present-day Chouteau in 1820.Carney, Amanda. \\"MAYES COUNTY ,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. (accessed August 5, 2013) Over a period of years, pioneers and explorers carved a trail through this section of the country that became known as the Texas or Old Military Road. It passed north and south near what is now known as U.S. Highway 69. In 1839, the United States government forced Osage bands from Oklahoma to end hostilities between the two tribes. They would be removed from Kansas and sent back to Oklahoma in 1871. In 1870, the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad started construction in the Cherokee Nation along the Kansas border, laying tracks to Texas. By June 1871, the railroad reached the point where the present town now lies. Now known as the Union Pacific, the railroad continues to be a valuable asset to the commerce of the community and county. A post office was eventually established naming the town Coo-y-yah, Indian Territory. Coo-y-yah is the Cherokee name for \\"huckleberry\\". On April 23, 1887, Coo-y-yah was changed to Pryor Creek, but the \\"Creek\\" was dropped by the post office on January 26, 1909.Tilly, George W. \\"PRYOR CREEK,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. (accessed August 5, 2013) The official name of the city government is still Pryor Creek despite a proposition put before voters in 1963 to change the name. Pryor Creek's first mayor, James Lee Mills, a Cherokee, served from 1894 to 1896. Mills was a businessman, newspaper publisher, and lawman. 20th century In 1951, voters approved the present city charter of a mayor-council government system, which provided for the election of a mayor, clerk, treasurer, police chief and eight councilors. The charter also established a cemetery, park, library board, and a municipal utility board, which oversees operations of the city-owned gas, water, electric and sewer systems. The Whitaker Orphan's Home was established in 1897 by W.T. and Stacy Whitaker to provide for the orphan white children of the Indian Territory. In 1908, the home became a state institution for orphans and other children in need. In 1982 the state closed down the home and turned the facility over to the Oklahoma Military Department. Under the umbrella of the Whitaker Education and Training Center, the base is home of the Thunderbird Youth Academy. Thunderbird Youth Academy conducts quasi-military program, which targets at- risk 16- to 18-year-old high school dropouts. The program teaches how to strengthen their academic performance, self-esteem, and life skills thus preparing the cadet for the work force and managing a healthy family environment. On April 27, 1942, the city's downtown business district was destroyed by a devastating tornado which struck at 4:45 p.m. Final figures showed property damage in excess of $2,000,000, and a casualty rate of 454, with 52 deaths. During World War II, the U.S. War Department built and the DuPont Company operated the Oklahoma Ordinance Works, an ammunition plant.Carney, Amanda. MAYES COUNTY , Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. (accessed August 5, 2013) A Prisoner of War Camp, mostly holding captured German soldiers, southeast of the city. The area later became the present-day Mid-America Industrial Park, which is the largest manufacturing park in the state. The industries located in the park provide jobs for hundreds of families that live in and around Mayes County. The park has been selected as the site for a new , $180 million Gatorade plant owned by PepsiCo. Other long established employers include Red Devil, NGC Paper, Georgia- Pacific, Solae, Lone Star Cement, Elkem Metals, Orchid Paper and the Grand River Dam Authority, who also operates a coal-fired power generation facility. Pryor and Mayes County is also home to a large agricultural economy which consists of cash crops, beef cattle industry, horse industry and dairy industry. Until recently, Mayes County was the second largest dairy producing county in the state. In 1991, Lucy Schultz was elected as the city's 31st mayor, becoming the first and only mayor of Pryor Creek.  Tornado  On April 27, 1942, a tornado swept along Pryor Creek's main street from the western edge of the business district to the eastern edge of the city, destroying nearly every building and causing extensive damage to the residential section. The storm killed 52 people, according to the U.S. Weather Bureau, but The Associated Press set the total at 60 two days after the storm. More than 400 were injured in the storm that caused damage estimated at US$2 million. The F4 tornado struck about 5 p.m. (17:00) local time, an hour and a half after one hit near Talala, Oklahoma, and mowed a path about long, killing three and injuring 12. Talala, which was not hit, is about northwest of Pryor Creek. Both of Pryor Creek's hospitals were wrecked by the storm, the city's water supply was disrupted, and there was no electrical or telephone service. Residential areas also suffered extensive damage. Governor Leon C. Phillips put the area under martial law, but because the Oklahoma National Guard had been activated for service during World War II, he sent state troopers to rescue victims, maintain order and prevent looting. The troopers were assisted by soldiers stationed at the Oklahoma Ordnance Works south of the city and by employees of duPont Co. that was to operate the gunpowder plant at the OOW. Ambulances were on the scene from Tulsa, Muskogee, Vinita, Claremore, Wagoner, and Siloam Springs, Arkansas. Water was trucked in from Vinita and from the Oklahoma Ordnance Works. Tulsa doctors interrupted their weekly meeting, and a team of 20 went to Pryor to care for victims. Others went to the Tulsa hospitals to treat any victims sent there. A shuttle train that transported workers between Muskogee and the Ordnance Works site was pressed into service to transport injured victims to Vinita, Oklahoma, for treatment. The Pryor tornado ranks as the fifth deadliest in Oklahoma history behind tornadoes at Woodward in 1947, Snyder in 1905, Peggs in 1920, and Antlers in 1945. The May 3, 1999, tornado at Midwest City caused more damage but fewer deaths. Talala residents said they did not see the typical funnel of a tornado in the storm. They described what looked like a series of streaks reaching from the clouds to the ground which leveled everything in their paths. At Pryor Creek, however, the tornado had a definite funnel.

Plot As summarized in a film publication, Robert Castleback (Lewis) has plans for worldwide power through a mysterious secret that he possesses. Arsene Lupin (Nowell), master thief but loyal Frenchman, knows of the secret and is attempting to obtain state papers held by Castleback. Two other persons in the employ of the Kaiser are attempting the same thing. Castleback is murdered and some suspect Lupin, who announces his intention to catch the real killer. Disguised as the chief of police, he works fearlessly alongside the police. Soon he comes into contact with another master criminal, Ribeira (Beery), who is masquerading as Maj. Parbury, and Lupin suspects that he is complicit in the crime. Lupin falls in love with Dolores Castleback (Adams), widow of the murdered man. When Ribeira, to get rid of Lupin, steals his daughter and informs Lupin that he will have to go alone to a deserted house to get her back, Lupin goes, foils the plot to kill him, and escapes through a tunnel that comes out in the home of Delores. As he turns from the mantelpiece where he has discovered the hiding place of the state papers, he sees a mysterious man that he has been trailing. To Lupin's horror he finds that the man is really Delores, who is in reality a German criminal. She kills herself and Lupin escapes.

The plan was abandoned following the invasion of Italy in summer 1943. Aftermath Photographs of the disaster At the time of the explosion, C√°diz had a population of some 100,000 inhabitants, with the shipyard employing almost 2,500 workers, the largest single employer in the city, and its destruction meant that many families no longer had any income. The shipyards would not be opened again until they were nationalised in 1952, but it wouldn't be until 1956 that steady work would again be available there.

Lure is short, located just behind snout within a depression that it rests in; the esca is mop-like, a dense cluster of numerous, short, thread-like cirri. The skin is densely covered with small to minute spine-like scales that are somewhat similar both in shape and feel to placoid scales of sharks. Single open lateral-line canal on body joining conspicuous canals on head and extending posteriorly to proximal portion of caudal fin.Caruso, J.H.

(ed.) (1984).Marine Fish Larvae. Morphology, Ecology, and Relation to Fisheries. Seattle:Washington Sea Grant Program. After hatching, the larvae swim to the surface and feed on plankton. As they mature, they return to the depths below. The morphology of the larval stage seems to reflect an adaptation to a long larval life. The larvae are translucent, round and found in the pelagic zone, unlike the benthic, dorsoventrally compressed adults.  Behavior  C. endeavouri has inflatable gills that it uses to fill its body with water, acting as a defense mechanism much like the pufferfish. When the gill chambers are completely filled with water, there is no inhalation or exhalation for 26 to 245 seconds. This is beneficial for energy preservation. The body of the C. endeavouri will increase in volume by 30% with full gill chambers and will protect it against predators.  Food Habits  Adults are ambush predators that use small lures above their snouts to attract small, invertebrate crustaceans to their mouths.Quigley, D. T. G., et al. ‚ÄúFirst Record of the Toadfish Chaunax Suttkusi (Caruso, 1989) (Pisces: Lophiiformes, Chaunacidae) from Irish Waters, Together with a Review of North Eastern Atlantic Records of C.

Little is known about the diet of larval and juvenile C. endeavouri, but they likely eat plankton during their pelagic stage. They also like to eat shrimps and other fish. They are also a source of food for many other bug sea creatures. (Ho, Two new species of the coffinfish genus Chaunax (Lophiiformes: Chaunacidae) from the Indian Ocean)  Perception  A very large number of lateral line canals allow the C. endeavouri to detect movement in their surroundings as they often live in low-visibility areas. This is especially beneficial as an ambush predator.  Predation  There is evidence suggesting that various kinds of anglerfish - including large species - are consumed by larger predatory fishes such as sharks.  Ecosystem roles  The C. endeavouri is a deep ocean, benthic predator of small crustaceans, like Acanthomysis microps, a deep sea shrimp.Biju Abraham & Saramma U. Panampunnayil (2009). \\"Mysids (Crustacea) from the shallow waters off Maharashtra and south Gujarat, India, with description of a new species\\". Marine Biology Research. 5 (4): 345‚Äì362. doi:10.1080/17451000802454890 And predated by deep sea piscivores like cow sharks.  Economic importance  Chaunax have been bycatch for deep sea trawlers.  Conservation  C. endeavouri was categorized as ‚ÄúHigh Risk‚Äù from oceanic trawlers in an Ecological Risk Assessment by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority due to their high susceptibility to trawlers (Being benthic) and relatively low productivity. However, they are non-threatened due to their wide area of distribution.Wayte, S., Dowdney, J., Williams, A., Bulman, C., Sporcic, M., Fuller, M., Smith, A.

Alumni of the school include two Nobel laureates, an Academy Award winner and many notable politicians, artists and scientists.  History Main entrance of the school Planned by Heinrich von Ferstel, the Wasagymnasium was built between 1869 and 1871 and was officially inaugurated on 16 October 1871. For many decades the school was popular amongst the cultured Jewish bourgeoisie. In 1900, around 70% of the students were Jewish, whereas in 1938 there were only around 50% Jewish students. The Anschluss to the Third Reich put an end to this in 1938 and the school was relocated. Instead, the Gau administration of the Reichsgau Niederdonau used the school building as its headquarters. In the meanwhile, the Wasagymnasium used the school building of the Schottengymnasium, which was shut down by the Nazis, from 1938 until 1945. In 2007, a group of students and their teacher organised a school project, called Erinnern Gedenktafel Wasagasse (German for \\"Remember\\"), in order to research the fates of former Jewish students. Furthermore, the school also installed a commemorative plaque, honouring and remembering all the students and teachers who were victims of Nazism. =Today= Known as one of the most demanding schools in Austria, the Wasagymnasium offers a traditional humanistic education with a focus on classical languages as well as a focus on modern languages. Furthermore, the school also offers an education with an emphasis on science. Its students regularly participate in different competitions, most notable the various language competitions in which the students of the Wasagymnasium were able to achieve many awards in the past few years. The University of Vienna cooperates with the Wasagymnasium and offers student teacher internships for its university students. Kooperationsschulen der Universit√§t Wien Fachdidaktikzentrum Geschichte, Sozialkunde und Politische Bildung: didactic news 12/2011 Several teachers from the Wasagymnasium also teach at the University of Vienna.

The plot is based on the notorious murder of silent movie director William Desmond Taylor. While Hollywood Story reaches a fictional conclusion, it follows the circumstances of the real-life event closely. Upon the release of the film, Universal promoted the appearance of several once famous silent screen celebrities. It came to light that the ones with speaking parts had received just $55 per day of shooting for their roles. Others, like Elmo Lincoln, the first screen Tarzan, were used as non-speaking extras and received only $15 per day. Plot New York theatrical producer Larry O'Brien (Conte) plans to found a motion picture company in Hollywood. He buys an old studio which was unused since the days of silent movies. There he's shown the office where a famous director was murdered twenty years earlier. Although there were many suspects the case hasn't been solved. O'Brian becomes fascinated by the subject and decides to make a film based on the case. To this end he begins interviewing the surviving participants and soon gets into danger himself. Cast Production It was the last film Castle made under his three year contract with Universal. He shot many scenes at the old Charlie Chaplin studio to ensure it had the feel of old Hollywood. The movie led to Castle being offered a contract to return to Columbia. Reception =Critical response= Film critic Bosley Crowther panned the film and he blamed the script. He wrote, \\"It is easy to see, now, why some pictures which sound promising at the start, on the strength of the ideas behind them, turn out to be dismal flops. Hollywood Story demonstrates it ... scriptwriters Frederick Kohner and Fred Brady have cooked up in the way of a plot‚Äîis a pretty routine assembly of simple who- dunnit cliches into a silly and not very startling disclosure of a motive for a crime. The police must have been awfully lazy back in 1929.\\"Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, June 7, 1951. Accessed: August 4, 2013. Film critic Dennis Schwartz generally liked the production and wrote about what may have motivated the studio executives to produce the film. He wrote, \\"A fairly absorbing crime thriller whose plot involves a look at Hollywood's silent stars. The film tries to capitalize on the success of the similar themed silent film modern day venture Sunset Boulevard which was released in 1950 ... The climax makes for a hard to guess whodunit and a nice peek into the silent film era and at some silent stars who make a cameo appearance and speak a few lines, like Helen Gibson and Francis X. Bushman ... The only thing that failed to work smoothly into the twisty script by Fred Kohner and Fred Brady and the confident direction of William Castle, was the romance between Adams and Conte. They end up getting married at the film's conclusion in a vain attempt to make this dark story seem lighter.\\"Schwartz, Dennis . Ozus' World Movie Reviews, film review, October 7, 2002.

According to Subterranean Records founder Steven Tupper, the Jars were one of the first bands to successfully combine 60s garage and 70s punk. They recorded two singles and were known for opening for many top punk and new wave bands that appeared in San Francisco during this period. Background Marc Time (b. Marc Gunther), Mik McDow (b. Mikkel McDow) and Armin Hammer (b. Gary Hobish) formed The Jars in 1978 with JD Buhl and Gary Nervo (b. Gary Mollica) (ex Pagans Road Manager). The Jars helped spearhead the Berkeley punk/new wave scene by playing at the International Caf√©, Aitos Club, Keystone Berkeley, Berkeley High School and various pizza parlors and frat parties. By 1979 the Jars were playing all over the Bay Area at the Mabuhay Gardens, the Deaf Club, the Temple and the Old Waldorf opening for Roky Erickson, The Angry Samoans, Horslips, The Dickies, The Flaming Groovies, Psycotic Pineapple, the Dead Kennedys, The Suspects, The Mutants, and MX-80 to name but a few. JD Buhl left the band in 1979. Despite its ubiquity in San Francisco's early punk scene, the band's recording history was brief. A 7\\" EP was recorded in 1979 for Subterranean Records, ‚ÄúStart Rite Now‚Äù, a cover of The Sonics' ‚ÄúPsycho‚Äù, and ‚ÄúElectric 3rd Rail.\\" In 1980, a second 7\\" 45, ‚ÄúTime of the Assassins/Jar Wars,‚Äù was recorded and released on a label run by Universal Records, a Telegraph Avenue record store. It featured a pic sleeve designed by Grammy- winning artist Hugh Brown showing Jack Ruby shooting Lee Harvey Oswald outside Berkeley's Elmwood Theater. Both songs received airplay on local college stations like KALX and performed strongly on the Mabuhay Gardens Rotten Record Chart. Mike Montalto (ex Special Guests, later with Red Meat) then joined on guitar. Sessions at Fantasy Studios for an EP \\"Teenage Rebellion\\" took place in 1981, but were never released. After the band's dissolution, Marc and Nervo formed the Art Faggots with Ray Farrell (ex Sonic Youth Road Manager) and Nervo's wife Marge on Drums. They also later formed Bo with Marc Monosonic and Snoopy. Bo opened for Isocracy, Rancid, The Offspring, Crimpshrine, Green Day and others at Berkeley's 924 Gilman Street in the late 1980s. Former Jars members remain active in music. Marc hosts the Sunday Morning Hangover on Eugene, Oregon's KWVA, for which he was honored as the Eugene Weekly's Top Radio Show award; archived recordings of his shows can be found at Archive.org. Mik McDow played with Beltain up until he passed away on February 7, 2019. Armin Hammer is an award-winning recording engineer; he owns San Francisco's A. Hammer Mastering & Digital Media and is still active with his band True Margrit. In 2014, J.D. Buhl released a new single (\\"Esmeralda\\" b/w \\"You're On My Mind\\") produced by Gary Hobish (Armin Hammer) with Mik Dow, Michael Montalto and Hammer on guitar, Gary Nervo on organ, and John C. Berry of Psycotic Pineapple on bass. He followed this with several compilation releases including the vinyl issue LITTLE VICTORIES which included several of the first Jars and Saviors garage recordings, and an album of all-new material (B-SIDES) that included contributions from Hammer, Dow, Montalto, and many others.

After the City of Detroit acquired the building its physical address was re-designated from John C. Lodge Freeway to its present address on Third Street and Michigan Avenue to disassociate itself from the building's prior occupants, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service who were the original owners and the MGM Grand Detroit Casino who purchased the building from the IRS. History The idea of consolidating Detroit's public safety was not a new idea, and in fact had been discussed extensively as far back as Mayor Dennis Archer's administration but it wasn't until recent years that the city began to realize that 1300 Beaubien, where the Detroit Police had been headquartered since 1923, was beginning to show signs of aging and serious structural problems as well as an infestation of rodents and insects throughout the building. The City's Fire Department on West Larned was in better condition than the police headquarters, but was starting to lack sufficient space to house the department's offices and communications center. As a result, both the police and fire departments had to go outside of city owned buildings for office space which began to cause a serious financial strain on the city bank accounts. Beginning with Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick's administration the city began kicking around the idea of consolidating the city's police and fire departments into one complex, however plans were temporarily halted following the sudden but not unexpected resignation of Kilpatrick because of his arrest on charges of federal corruption. Following Kwame Kilpatrick's departure from the Mayor's office a special election was held in May 2009 and former Detroit Pistons and Basketball Hall of Famer Dave Bing was elected the new Mayor of Detroit. One year later on June 11, 2010 it was announced that the city had agreed to purchase the 600,000 square foot former MGM Grand Detroit temporary casino at 1300 John C. Lodge Freeway for $6.32 million, and that it would undergo a $60 million renovation funded primarily through the Detroit Building Authority. The plans were temporarily halted again when the Detroit City Council rejected the Mayor's plan 6 to 3 to purchase the former casino After negotiations the City Council voted 5 to 4 for the purchase of the property.Detroit City Council Votes 5 to 4 to purchase Former MGM Grand temporary casino On June 28, 2013, exactly one year and seven days later, the Detroit Public Safety Headquarters opened with Mayor Bing, City Council members, the Wayne County Executive and other dignitaries attending a ribbon cutting ceremony official opening the complex.Ribbon Cutting Ceremony Scheduled At New Detroit Public Safety Headquarters Police Chief James Craig and Fire Chief Craig Dougherty stated that both of their departments have already begun the move to the new DPHS. Mayor Bing added that when both the Police and Fire Departments complete their moves that 1300 Beaubien and 250 West Larned would be put up for sale by the city.

Shikhin (, variant spelling ◊©◊Å◊ï÷º◊ó÷¥◊ô◊ü), known in Greek as Asochis, was a central Galilean village that was abandoned in the fourth century CE. It was situated right next to the regional capital, Sepphoris, and its ruins have been discovered about northwest of Nazareth. , the site is under excavation. So far, evidence of extensive pottery work and a synagogue have been uncovered. Location Shikhin is located in central Galilee next to the ancient city of Sepphoris, near the modern-day Moshav Tzippori, within Zippori National Park and about northwest of Nazareth. View from Tzippori of Beit Netofa Valley. Shikhin is located along the left-hand edge of the photographs is highlighted in red. On the right hand side of the picture is Hoshaya. History First-century historian Josephus refers to Shikhin as Asochis (Greek: ·ºàœÉœâœáŒØœÇ). He described the village as one of the first Jewish settlements formed in Galilee. He dated it to the Hasmonaean Dynasty (140-63 BCE). The Talmud describes the village as being home to many potters. The village was abandoned in the fourth century CE when the buildings were dismantled and the stones reused elsewhere. The Plain of Asochis lay nearby, identified today as Beit Netofa Valley (Sahel el- Buttauf in Arabic), an area south of Kfar Manda, but due north of Sepphoris. The Jerusalem Talmud, when making note of the former wealth of the village, writes: > There were three cities whose tax ledgers were carried by wagon unto > Jerusalem: Cabul, Asochis, and Migdal of the dyers,Hebrew: ◊û◊í◊ì◊ú ◊¶◊ë◊¢◊ô◊ô◊ê = > Migdal ·π¢ebo ªaya. and all three of them were destroyed. Cabul because of a > schism, Asochis because of sorcery, and Migdal of the dyers because of > lechery.The Jerusalem Talmud (Ta'anit 4:5 [24b]) History of archaeological research Shikhin jug that was damaged in a furnace. An archaeological survey of an area less than 1.5 km north of Sepphoris, that led to the identification of Shikhin, took place in 1988, and a second one was undertaken in 2011. In 2012, excavation got underway led by James Riley Strange of Samford University, Mordechai Aviam of Kinneret College and David Fiensy of Kentucky Christian University. Significance Josephus mentions in the same context Shikhin and nearby Sepphoris. In 2013, Aviam noted that Shikhin is one of the two earliest Galilean settlement names attested from the Second Temple period, and he expressed the hope that the digs will help clarify the unsolved question regarding the identity of the Galileans. After the Assyrian destruction of Israel in the 8th century BCE, there is hardly any historical evidence concerning the history and population of the Galilee, until the second century BCE redevelopment of the region under the Hasmoneans. The Galileans of the Hellenistic period might have been remnants from the First Temple period, immigrants from Judea, or converts to Judaism. Being a village located in close proximity to a large city - Sepphoris, capital of Galilee - and given that both ancient sources and archaeological finds attest to Shikhin's importance as a major centre for pottery production, the archaeologists hope to learn about the \\"relationship and the sociological connection\\" between village and city. Strange said he believes the site will further lend understanding of Galilean Jewish village life and the economy during the period of time when the Talmud was written and Christianity was establishing itself. Seven molds used to make oil lamps, the most ever found in a village in Israel, were recovered from the site. According to Aviam, this is strong evidence that \\"the production of oil lamps was very important\\" to Shikhin. Archaeological findings The village expanded over three low hilltops, with a general north-south orientation and over a distance of little over one kilometre. The hill of Jebel Qat lays outside and to the east of the village, and there archaeologists found a cave used as hideaway, signs of quarrying, and of olive and/or wine industry. In August 2013, the team announced that it had uncovered evidence of an ancient synagogue and houses. They also found evidence of pottery production in the area. Three sarcophagi, largely unadorned except for some non-figurative stone relief, have been uncovered on neighbouring Jebel Qat, near one of a number tombs discovered around the village.

It is located in the village of √òrsta. It is the church for the √òrsta parish which is part of the S√∏re Sunnm√∏re prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of M√∏re. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1864 by the architects Heinrich Ernst Schirmer and Wilhelm von Hanno. The church seats about 350 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to 1385, but the church wasn't new at that time. The first church was a stave church. In 1665, the roof was severely damaged due to lightning strikes and a new roof was built. Sometime before 1685, cross-arms were built to transform the church into a cruciform design. In 1864, a new church was constructed about to the northeast and when it was completed, the old church was torn down. Some of the interior furnishings of the old church were reused in the new church. Some of the interior design elements were inspired by the historic Urnes Stave Church.

His Name Day is on the Monday of Holy Week. Biography Future Archbishop =Early life and education= Igor Balabanov was born and spent his childhood in the old city of Kashira (Moscow region). His father, Anatoly Balabanov, died in 2001. His mother, Nadezhda Balabanova, died in 1999. According to the family tradition, 40 days after birth the child was baptized in the church of the Holy Martyrs Florus and Laurus in Kashira‚Äîthe only church that was open in those days in the city. From his early childhood Igor served in this church under the guidance of nun Angelina‚Äîtoday Mother Macaria, the prioress of the Makarievo-Pisemsky monastery located in the diocese of Kostroma and Galich‚Äîa very strict and demanding woman taught an altar boy everything she knew about church services. After ten years of high school, he served in the military in Smolensk. In 1975, after leaving the army, he entered the Moscow Theological Seminary. After the first year of education he received only excellent grades, and thus was immediately transferred to the third class, and in 1978, after graduation from the seminary, he was admitted to the Moscow Theological Academy without sitting for entrance examinations. =Ordination= On March 5, 1979 Metropolitan Juvenal tonsured him with the name of Joseph after the righteous Patriarch Joseph in the Church of the Holy Prince Daniel of Moscow in Novodevichy Convent. On March 9 that year, Metropolitan Juvenal ordained monk Joseph as a deacon and on July 26, Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Pimen assigned deacon Joseph to a full-time service position at the Church of the Assumption in Novodevichy Convent. On April 23, 1981, on Holy Thursday, monk Joseph was ordained to the priesthood by Metropolitan Juvenal. In 1982, on the feast of the Annunciation, he was awarded a pectoral cross. On September 15, 1982 by the directive of Pimen he was placed at the service of Metropolitan of Krutitsa and Kolomna Juvenal. Two weeks later on September 30, Metropolitan Juvenal appointed Joseph pastor of the Ilyinsky temple in the city of Serpukhov, Moscow region. The following year on July 13, hieromonk Joseph was assigned as the dean of Serpukhov circuit, consisting of Serpukhovsky, Chekhovsky and Narofominsky districts. He held this position until 1999. The revival of traditional styles of worship; the construction of new churches and monasteries or the restoration of existing places of worship; and development of religious life in all its forms, became the main objectives of the new dean. =Revival of the Vysotsky monastery= On March 19, 1984 hieromonk Joseph became hegumen of the Ilinsky Church. Under his guidance the church underwent extensive external and internal restoration. The restoration included the construction of a new two-story brick building, replacement of plumbing systems and placement of an iron fence around the precinct. But most importantly the new hegumen turned out to be the first bishop who was able to end longstanding conflicts and unite all the clergy and believers around the parish. On November 22, 1987 hieromonk Joseph received four awards and was elevated to the rank of archimandrite by Patriarch Pimen. In early June 1990, he took part in the Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church as delegate from the diocesan clergy of the city of Moscow, when the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia was elected Metropolitan of Leningrad Alexis (Ridiger). The same year Archimandrite Joseph was elected as a member of the City Council of Serpukhov. As a member of the city council he has done everything possible to return to the Church all its monasteries and churches, including the Vysotsky monastery located right in the centre of Serpukhov. On February 28, 1991 Alexy II and the Holy Synod made Archimandrite Joseph hegumen of the Vysotsky Monastery, with the right to deliver services with crozier. He worked to revive this ancient monastery, founded by Sergius of Radonezh in 1374. At the initiative of the hegumen there was continued the veneration of the miraculous icon of the Mother of God \\"The Inexhaustible Cup\\", venerated in many parishes of the Russian Orthodox Church, with akathist to the Mother of God read daily before this icon. The first edition of the akathist to the Theotokos \\"The Inexhaustible Cup\\" was made by Bishop Joseph based on the only copy of the akathist left by an unknown old woman. In 1993 Archimandrite Joseph was elected as a member of the Diocesan Council of the Moscow diocese. On September 25, 1995 Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Alexy II, during his visit to the Vysotsky Monastery, awarded Joseph with the Order of St. Sergius. On March 28, 1996 Alexy bestowed on him the right to celebrate Divine Liturgy with open royal gates. =Episcopal ministry in the city of Yaroslavl= Archbishop Joseph Archbishop Joseph at the festival \\"Great Maslenitsa\\" in Birobidzhan Elevation to the rank of archbishop Archbishop Joseph sanctifying new icons for the church in Birobidzhan On December 28, 1998 Alexy II and the Holy Synod made Joseph Bishop of the Yaroslavl diocese. His episcopal ordination took place in the Epiphany Cathedral at Yelokhovo on January 31, 1999. From February 1999, Bishop Joseph carried out his episcopal duties in the old city of Yaroslavl. By the directive of Alexy II, Bishop Joseph served also as vicar of the diocese, where he worked to build new churches and monasteries and to revive abandoned temples. A temple of the Epiphany built in the 17th century was renovated and finally transferred to the Diocese of Yaroslavl and Rostov. For a long time the temple building was closed for worships and was used as a museum. The Great Consecration of the temple was the final point of his episcopal ministry in the city of Yaroslavl. =Episcopal ministry in the city of Birobidzhan= Alexy II and the Holy Synod made Joseph bishop of a newly founded diocese located within the borders of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast in the Russian Far East on October 7, 2002. In 2003-2005 Bishop Joseph led construction work on the first cathedral in history of Birobidzhan. On September 21, 2005 the cathedral in honor of the Annunciation was completed. The day of the consecration of the cathedral, Joseph was awarded the Order of St. Innocent, Metropolitan of Moscow and Kolomna (second class). In 2006, a Socio-Educational Center was built at the east side of the cathedral precinct. In ten years dozens of churches were built all over the region, including the Convent of Saint Innocent in Razdolnoye and two temples in correctional facilities. Throughout his career Bishop Joseph received non-Church awards. An order of the Minister of Justice on January 22, 2002 awarded Joseph the medal \\"For strengthening of the penal system\\" (second class). A decree of the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin on August 8, 2005 awarded Joseph the Order For Merit to the Fatherland (second class). February 12, 2007 by the order of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia he was awarded the medal \\"For strengthening of the penal system\\" (first class). A decree of President Dmitry Medvedev on April 29, 2009 awarded Joseph the Order of Friendship \\"For great personal contribution to the spiritual and cultural traditions and strengthening friendship between peoples\\". On October 1, 2012 the governor of the Jewish Autonomous Region Alexander Vinnikov bestowed on Bishop Joseph the Jewish Autonomous Region Award Honorable Medal \\"Honor and Respect\\".

Haynesworth was arrested in Richmond at the age of 18 in 1984 after a woman identified him as her attacker. He was convicted of four violent rapes in the East End of the city. He was sentenced to a total of 84 years in prison. Haynesworth maintained his innocence throughout the years of incarceration. Based on DNA and other evidence, the crimes for which he was convicted are now believed to have been committed by a neighbor who resembled Haynesworth. In 2009, new state laws and procedures allowed for DNA testing, which was not available in the 1980s. Semen collected from the first attack implicated the neighbor and ruled out Haynesworth. After reviewing this and other evidence, local prosecutors brought the case to the office of Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who began advocating for Haynesworth. His convictions in two of the cases were vacated, and he was released from prison on parole in March 2011. Haynesworth was fully exonerated in the remaining two cases in December 2011. The case, which The Washington Post called \\"one of the state's most extraordinary legal cases\\",\\"Cuccinelli tries to help convicted felon Haynesworth clear his name\\" , Washington Post, 27 September 2011; used DNA testing and new state laws that allowed convicts to present new evidence in cases to prove innocence. The General Assembly passed a bill in 2012 to pay Haynesworth compensation for his wrongful convictions and lengthy incarceration, amounting to a total of $1 million in a lump sum payment, two types of annuities, and tuition at a community college. The legislators wanted to help him make his way in his life. Description of attacks Over the course of four weeks in the winter of 1984, five women were assaulted in a series of attacks in and around the East End neighborhood of Richmond, Virginia. On January 3, 1984, a 20-year-old woman was raped at knifepoint near the daycare center where she worked.National Registry of Exonerations - Thomas Haynesworth, University of Michigan Law School On January 21, an 18-year-old woman was sodomized at knifepoint near a grocery store. On January 27, a woman was approached outside her home by a man demanding money and sex; she locked herself inside and called the police while the man fled. On January 30, an 18-year-old woman was abducted, raped, and sodomized in nearby Henrico County, within blocks of the other attacks. On February 1, a 19-year-old woman was abducted at gunpoint outside her home, but the attacker fled when the woman's dog began barking. Arrest and prosecution Given the locations and nature of the attacks, and the description of the attacker, police believed one man was responsible. On February 5, 1984, the victim of the January 27 attack saw Haynesworth, a young, African-American man, walking near a grocery store (where his mother had sent him to buy groceries) and, believing him to be her attacker, called the police. A police officer pulled up next to Haynesworth, and asked if he would allow a woman whose house was broken into to look at him. The woman identified him as her attacker and he was arrested. Haynesworth was identified in a police lineup by all four other women. Eyewitness identifications have been shown in studies to be notoriously unreliable. Other studies have shown that eyewitnesses are more likely to misidentify someone of another race than someone of their own race.Gary L. Wells & Elizabeth A.

(Charges were dropped in the January 27 attack, despite the victim of that attack having been the first victim to identify him.) He maintained his innocence, saying that authorities had the wrong man. Haynesworth was convicted in three of the four trials, and sentenced to 10 years, 36 years, and 28 years in prison, respectively, for a total of 84 years in prison. Although Haynesworth was in custody, rapes continued to occur in the same neighborhood. At least ten young women reported they were attacked by a young black man who referred to himself as the \\"Black Ninja\\". On December 19, 1984, Leon Davis, who resembled Haynesworth, had the same blood type, and lived nearby, was arrested and charged with a dozen rapes during the nine months after Haynesworth's arrest.\\"After 27 years in prison, Richmond man nears proof of innocence\\", Richmond Times-Dispatch After Davis was arrested, the rapes stopped. Davis was later convicted of several rape charges and sentenced to multiple life terms in jail. Haynesworth continued to maintain his innocence.

Push for exoneration =Background of new laws and procedures= In 2001, Virginia's General Assembly passed a law allowing inmates to ask for DNA tests at any time. Numerous persons were serving time who had not been able to use DNA in their trials. In 2002, voters passed a referendum to allow DNA evidence to be presented by convicted felons after their convictions - and after the 21-day period following conviction that was previously allowed in the law.2002 referendum, Ken Plum A 2004 law expanded the post-conviction rules to allow courts to consider also new non- DNA evidence, including new testimony. (While serving in the Virginia Senate, Ken Cuccinelli, who was State Attorney General when Haynesworth was seeking exoneration, had voted for an earlier version of this law, but it failed.) In 2005, five wrongfully convicted men were exonerated in Virginia. Governor Mark Warner ordered the State Attorney General's Office to conduct a sweeping review of thousands of cases from between 1973 and 1988, Haynesworth's among them.\\"Man freed after 27 years in prison for crimes he didn't commit\\", Washington Post, 21 March 2011 =New evidence and first exoneration= Under this review, semen collected from the January 3, 1984 rape was tested for DNA evidence, a forensic technology that was not available in 1984. The test cleared Haynesworth and implicated Davis. (DNA for another case in which Haynesworth was suspected, but not charged, was tested and it also implicated Davis.) After the test, the Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project began advocating for Haynesworth. On September 18, 2009, the Supreme Court of Virginia issued a writ of innocence to Haynesworth for the charges in the January 3, 1984 case. =Cuccinelli begins advocating= No physical evidence could be found for the other two cases, so the state prosecutors gave Haynesworth two polygraph tests, which he passed. In 2010, Commonwealth's attorneys Michael Herring and Wade Kizer of Richmond and Henrico counties, respectively, brought the case to the attention of Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a former state senator. Cuccinelli began examining the case, covering a wall in his office with evidence. Late in the evening a few weeks after the initial meeting, Cuccinelli called one of his assistant district attorneys and declared, \\"This man is innocent. We need to get him out of prison as soon as possible. When can we do it?\\"\\"The Passion of Ken Cuccinelli\\", NewsMax Cuccinelli later said, \\"It was a complex decision, but it wasn't a hard decision.\\" He also said, \\"It's hard to describe how painful it is to me that somebody would suffer what he has.\\"\\"Cleared of Rape but Lacking Full Exoneration\\", New York Times, 25 September 2011 Release Following the Virginia Supreme Court writ of innocence and Haynesworth's petition for writs in the other two cases, Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell asked the state's parole board to review Haynesworth's case. It approved him for parole. On the morning of March 21, 2011 (his 46th birthday), Haynesworth was released from prison on parole. Guards awakened him around 1am ET to inform him of his release, and other inmates gave him a birthday card to take home. He walked out of the prison, Greensville Correctional Center in Jarratt, Virginia, around 11am, carrying all his belongings (a television and a single garbage bag with the rest of his belongings). He was welcomed by his mother and sisters, along with other family members. His mother, Dolores Haynesworth, said, \\"He's home. It's still hard to believe. I'm holding him, but it's still hard to believe.\\" Haynesworth said, \\"I always believed this day would come,\\" and added, \\"I didn't think it would take 27 years.\\" Despite his release, Haynesworth was dogged by the convictions for the two remaining cases; as new physical evidence was unavailable, these remained on his record. As a result, he was still listed on the state's sex offender registry. Because of this status, Haynesworth had to wear an electronic ankle monitor, be subject to curfews, inform authorities in order to move from one home to another, and had to request permission to visit his young nieces. Knowing how hard it would be for Haynesworth to find a job until he was fully exonerated, Cuccinelli hired him to work as a clerk in his office. Haynesworth said Cuccinelli was \\"an extraordinary guy\\" and that as \\"a total stranger [he] put it on the line for me.\\" Cuccinelli had also invited Haynesworth to his office, where the State Attorney General personally apologized to him for the miscarriage of justice in his case. Push for writs of innocence in the Court of Appeals Cuccinelli, the local prosecutors, and Haynesworth's lawyers petitioned the Court of Appeals of Virginia to grant a writ of innocence in the remaining two cases. Despite the unanimous agreement of the prosecutors and Cuccinelli (who, as attorney general, was the state's chief law enforcement officer), the court seemingly interpreted the new laws allowing for Haynesworth to make his case more strictly than the General Assembly intended, according to The New York Times. The court asked for further briefs from the parties to discuss whether the exonerating evidence should be \\"conclusive\\". Cuccinelli argued that requiring extra briefs raised the standard of proof too high, beyond what was intended by the General Assembly. He said the only form of conclusive proof is DNA. In a pointed statement, he wrote that, as the state had disposed of the DNA evidence in these two cases, \\"it seems paradoxical to demand 'conclusive' evidence from Haynesworth when the commonwealth has deprived him of the opportunity to produce such evidence.\\" Appearing in person before the court, Cuccinelli argued passionately for Haynesworth's exoneration, saying, \\"This case has kept many prosecutors from going to bed at night. It's a real wake-up call. Not to say things need to be changed, but that this could happen.\\" Shawn Armbrust of the Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project said, \\"To find Haynesworth guilty, a jury would have to accept the coincidence that there were two guys in the same neighborhood who looked alike and were committing the same crimes.\\" Full exoneration On December 6, 2011, in a 6-4 decision, the Court of Appeals granted writs of innocence in the remaining two rape cases, fully exonerating Haynesworth. Appearing alongside Cuccinelli and his attorneys at an emotional news conference following the ruling, Haynesworth said, (Note: Convicted felons are prohibited from voting in Virginia, even after they serve their sentences and complete parole or probation.) Cuccinelli said, Cuccinelli also said of Haynesworth, \\"His composure, dignity and faithfulness are an absolute witness to me. I am an admirer here.\\"\\"Va. court exonerates wrongly convicted man in rapes\\", Hampton Roads, December 2011 Haynesworth continued working in Cuccinelli's office, and planned to open his own auto repair business. As of December 2012, he was still working in Cuccinelli's office.\\"Faces of 2012: Thomas Haynesworth\\", Richmond Times-Dispatch =Compensation= In its 2012 session, the General Assembly passed a bill granting $1,075,178 in compensation to Haynesworth for wrongful imprisonment, and it was signed by Gov. Bob McDonnell on April 5, 2012.McDonnell signs bill giving $1 million to Haynesworth Under the legislation, Haynesworth was to receive an initial lump sum of $215,036, and $759,232 to be paid in an annuity over 15 years. The legislature also granted an additional $100,910 for an annuity to provide Haynesworth with a monthly income of $1,516 when he reaches age 60, and provided him with tuition of up to $10,000 in the Virginia community college system. Haynesworth said the compensation was \\"not what it could have been\\" but that he was \\"content\\" with it. The bill's state Senate sponsor, Henry L. Marsh, said \\"No amount of money can make up for the experience that Mr. Haynesworth suffered, but I think this bill is a good result in terms of helping him restore his life.\\" Cuccinelli said, \\"Although we wish that the amount of money could have been greater, we also know that no amount can make up for those 27 lost years. We pray that this will allow Thomas a new beginning to pursue the dreams he has been waiting almost three decades to fulfill.\\"\\"Statement of Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli on Thomas Haynesworth's state compensation for wrongful incarceration\\", Press Release, Office of the Attorney General Gov. McDonnell said, \\"Now, as Mr. Haynesworth begins the next chapter in his life, it is morally right for Virginia to provide him with a means to financial security and the ability to move on with his future. This restitution will help ensure that Mr. Haynesworth is able to build upon his freedom and return to society in a successful way.\\"\\"McDonnell signs bill giving Thomas Haynesworth $1M\\", Washington Post, 06 April 2012 =Legal ramifications= Haynesworth was only the second convict of nearly 200 such cases to be exonerated without the support of DNA evidence. The majority of the court said \\"a rational trier of fact\\" could not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Haynesworth was the perpetrator. But, the dissenting judges said sufficient evidence still existed in the victims' original eyewitness identifications of Haynesworth to convict him. They said that the law did not allow for writs of innocence in such cases, rendering them \\"powerless to act\\". Peter Neufeld of the Innocence Project said, > It's much harder when you don't have the smoking gun of DNA. This is the > very first time in the history of the Innocence Project where the attorney > general and two local prosecutors joined us in seeking an exoneration, yet > it nevertheless took nine months, two trips to the Court of Appeals and six > judges to ensure the relief that was obvious to everyone. The case caused law enforcement and criminal justice officials to re-assess the reliability of eyewitness identifications. Neufeld of the Innocence Project said the dissenting judges \\"were still somewhat hung up on the fact that a couple women made these misidentifications,\\" and said, \\"What that tells us is that we still have a long way to go for people to appreciate how often eyewitnesses are mistaken.\\" Cuccinelli said the Haynesworth case proved that the new state laws allowing non-biological evidence to be presented could work, but that the laws needed to be reworked to make it less difficult to win an exoneration. He said, \\"to have to prove by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable juror would find beyond a reasonable doubt that someone committed a crime is mind-numbing in the extreme.\\" He said he understood that the standard needed to be high to avoid endless appeals, but that courts were too unwilling to rehear cases after the conviction. He also said that he did not necessarily think that the agreement of an attorney general and prosecutors should automatically lead to an exoneration, but that > If there's good enough reason for everybody to agree, then you'd think your > chances of getting over the legal hurdles would be pretty good. He added, > \\"It needs to be a high bar, but the process by which it's handled and the > hoops you have to get through, I think, are worthy of > reconsideration.\\"Cuccinelli: Va. law should help clear names of wrongly > convicted Cuccinelli said that the case was a reminder to him and to prosecutors that \\"the system isn't perfect, and neither are we.\\" See also *List of wrongful convictions in the United States External links *\\"Exonerations: Thomas Haynesworth\\", The Innocence Project *\\"Thomas Haynesworth\\", Michigan Law & Northeastern Law National Registry of Exonerations References Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Legal history of Virginia Category:Overturned convictions in the United States Category:People wrongfully convicted of rape ","title":"Thomas Haynesworth"},{"id":"40155786","text":"Brigadier Hector Eduardo Ruiz Airport (, ) is a public use airport located east-northeast of Coronel Su√°rez, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The film explores the damage rapid development has wrought in her native Cambodia on both a human and environmental level. The film premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2013 and won the Grand Jury Prize for World Documentary. The film also received the Golden Gate Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 2013 San Francisco International Film Festival.  Synopsis  \\"We've worked so hard on this land,‚Äù says Sav Samourn. ‚ÄúAnd now they've come to destroy it all. Sooner or later it will all be gone.‚Äù A River Changes Course intimately captures the stories of three families living in Cambodia as they strive to maintain their traditional ways of life amid rapid development and environmental degradation. Deep in the jungle, Sav Samourn struggles as large companies encroach and ‚Äúprogress‚Äù claims the life-giving forests. She discovers there's little room for wild animals, ghosts ‚Äì and the home she has always known. In a fishing hamlet, Sari Math must quit school to help support his family. But as the fish catch dwindles, Sari and his family find their livelihood threatened. In a village, Khieu Mok must leave to seek work in a Phnom Penh factory to help pay her family's debts. But city life proves no better, and Khieu struggles between her need to send money home and her duty to be with her loved ones. From Cambodia's forests to its rivers, from its idyllic rice fields to the capital's pulsing heart, forces of radical change are transforming the landscape of the country ‚Äì and the dreams of its people. The film's original Khmer title, Kbang Tik Tonle, is the traditional practice of dipping one's hands into the water and drinking the water with both hands. This single act connects the Cambodian people to the water, to nature, and ultimately to life.  Release  The film premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2013. It also screened at The San Francisco International Film Festival, Full Frame Documentary Film Festival, Seattle International Film Festival, The Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival, Environmental Film Festival at Yale, Environmental Film Festival in the Nation's Capital, RiverRun International Film Festival, Atlanta Film Festival, Nashville Film Festival, Green Film Festival in Seoul, Docville International Documentary Film Festival, Lincoln Film Society - Season Of Cambodia, The Museum of Modern Art ContemporAsian Film Program, Sydney Film Festival, Biografilm Festival, Jerusalem Film Festival, DocFest Munich, and many more prior to its theatrical release and broadcast worldwide.  Reception  During its theatrical run, The New York Times selected A River Changes Course as a \\"NYT Critics' Pick\\". Nicole Herrington found Ms. Mam's \\"intimate portrait of three Cambodian families struggling to maintain their ways of life amid environmental degradation caused by development is a beautiful example of the form. Instead of delving into the politics of their plight, Ms. Mam delivers a universal story\\" and that \\"this human story is profound enough to stand on its own.\\" Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote, \\"Beautiful images can be a distraction in a serious documentary, but that's hardly the case here. They draw us in so we can better understand the hurtling changes that endanger the future of Cambodia and, by extension, much of the developing world.\\" While Sheri Linden of the Los Angeles Times found \\"Mam's camera work is exquisite in its immediacy and agility. One of the most striking aspects of her film is the intimacy it achieves without feeling intrusive or turning her subjects into fodder for a message.\\" During its festival run, Doug Cummings at LA Weekly highlighted the film as one of four movies to see at the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival, regarding it as ‚Äúa beautifully lensed and compelling portrait,‚Äù ‚ÄúMam‚Äôs eye for composition is extraordinary,‚Äù and concluding that ‚Äúnever alarmist or sensational, the film grips with quiet sincerity.‚Äù Writing for the San Francisco Bay Guardian, Dennis Harvey picked the film as one of five must-see documentaries at the San Francisco International Film Festival calling it ‚Äúa vividly-shot, meditative look at lives being forced to modernize.‚Äù The Huffington Post called the film ‚Äúbreathtakingly beautiful‚Ä¶breaks new ground,‚Äù echoing the words of The Phnom Penh Post, which noted the film as ‚Äúa profound new take on the Cambodian experience.‚Äù After its Australian premiere at the Sydney Film Festival, The AU Review found ‚ÄúThe power of the film is in the telling of it‚Äù while Bermuda News concurred that this ‚Äúcinematically spectacular and sensory journey is a profound portrait.‚Äù Khmericain, a multimedia website for Cambodian-Americans wrote this in their review: ‚ÄúThe raw, straightforward portrayal compels us to think‚Ä¶and find parallels to our own experience.‚Äù  Awards  * Grand Jury Prize for World Cinema Documentary at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. * Grand Jury Prize for Best Feature at the 2013 Atlanta Film Festival. * Center for Documentary Studies Filmmaker Award at the 2013 Full Frame Documentary Film Festival. * Human Rights Award at the 2013 River Run Film Festival. * Grand Jury Prize for Best Feature at the 2013 Environmental Film Festival at Yale. * Golden Gate Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 2013 San Francisco International Film Festival. * Best Director and Best Cinematography at the 2013 Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival. * Grand Jury Conscience Award at the 2013 Docville International Documentary Film Festival. * Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary Feature at the 2013 Green Film Festival in Seoul. *Best Documentary at the 2013 Tacoma Film Festival *Audience Award at the 2013 Tutti nello stesso piatto Festival *Nominated for the Independent Spirit Awards Stella Artois Truer Than Fiction Award, presented to the director of a non- fiction film that displays the finest artistic vision. *Special Mention, International Documentary Association Pare Lorentz Award, which recognizes films that demonstrates exemplary filmmaking while focusing on the appropriate use of the natural environment, justice for all and the illumination of pressing social problems.

It provided an invaluable link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans that was vital to both commerce and the defense of the Western Hemisphere. Therefore, the defense of the Canal Zone was the United States' chief concern in the American Theater. Panama never received Lend-Lease assistance, but in return for the rights to build military infrastructure within Panamanian territory, the United States undertook large-scale public works projects, which did much to modernize the country and boost the economy. History =Economics= According to Thomas M. Leonard's Latin America during World War II, the war had a major impact on the Panamanian economy. Commercial transit through the canal dropped more than a third between 1940 and 1945, resulting in a two-thirds decrease in toll revenues. In contrast, Panama's domestic production rose, due to an increased demand caused by the war. Production of sugar, milk, and slaughtered cattle nearly doubled between 1939 and 1946. The government accelerated the take off by quadrupling expenditures, but the real catalyst was the influx in American dollars. Between 1930 and 1943, American capital investments dropped sharply in every Latin American country except oil-rich Venezuela and Panama. Leonard says that Panama enjoyed the higher percentage increase of the two, as investment multiplied threefold to $514 million, mostly in banking and utilities. The number of American- controlled enterprises increased from twenty-two in 1929 to seventy-nine in 1943. Additionally, an estimated 12.5 percent of the Panamanian workforce was employed in the Canal Zone. In 1939, there were 3,511 \\"gold roll\\" (U.S. rate) workers in the zone, and 11, 246 \\"silver roll\\" (Local rate) workers. By 1942 the numbers had grown to 8,550 and 28,686, respectively. The influx of workers to the Canal Zone and to Panama City and Col√≥n was so large that the Panamanian government complained about the scarcity of teachers and other skilled employees. The government did, however, try to take advantage of the situation by \\"strengthening\\" English language education in schools and emphasizing vocational training in commercial and business administration so as to encourage the development of small businesses and provide skilled employees for the increased number of commercial enterprises. Panamanians, as well as immigrants were employed in the construction of a third set of locks for the canal, numerous highways, and over 100 defense sites across the country. The highway construction included a stretch of road from Panama City to R√≠o Hato Field in the west, and a road between Panama City and Colon, known as the Transisthmian Highway. Along with the increased number of Panamanians, the United States also importated thousands of workers from other Central American nations and the West Indies. The additional workers and military personnel prompted the American government to purchase huge amounts of food and other goods, thus helping to spur activity in Panama's agricultural industry. =President Arias= Elected in 1940, Arnulfo Arias was the President of Panama during two of the first years of the war. He was an overt fascist and regarded as pro-Axis by the Allies for his hostility to the United States and his eagerness to limit American influence over his territory. In 1939, the United States military requested 999-year leases from the Republic of Panama to build over 100 sites outside the Canal Zone ‚Äì such as airfields, anti-aircraft batteries, and warning stations ‚Äì which would be used for the defense of the canal. Arias demanded compensation in the form of cash and the transfer to Panama of various properties, but for the United States the price was too high. Negotiations dragged on for the next two years. Eventually, on February 13, 1941, the Panamanian government advised the Americans that, if it were to grant such a request, the United States government would have to declare that an imminent threat to the canal's safety existed. On the same day, the Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, issued the following statement: On February 18, the Panamanian government issued a memorandum that included twelve specific demands in exchange for the base leases: A map of the Panama Canal Zone. *Transfer, without cost, of the sanitation systems in the cities of Panama and Colon *Transfer of all lands belonging to the Panama Railroad in Panama City and Colon, valued at approximately $12 million *Both governments to intensify their efforts at preventing contraband from the Canal Zone into Panamanian territory *Construction of a bridge across the canal *U.S. assumption of a third of all costs to improve and maintain all roads and highways used by its military in Panama *The cessation of importing Caribbean blacks to work in the Canal Zone *U.S. military police and zone police restricted to the use of only billy clubs outside of the zone *Excess electricity from canal operations to be distributed to Panama City and Colon, as requested by the Panamanian government *United States to assume full cost of the road to Rio Hato, and therefore to pay the $2 million borrowed by Panama for this purchase from the U.S.-operated Export-Import Bank *The United States to transfer the railroad station in Panama City to the government of Panama *The United States to pay an indemnity of the flow of U.S. troops during wartime interrupted regular canal traffic *The United States to provide workers for building an oil pipeline between Panama City and the Balboa port. The cost of meeting these demands was estimated to be $25‚Äì30 million, and was one of the reasons why the negotiations lasted so long. There was also a serious disagreement over the length of the leases for the new defense sites. Most agreed that 999 years was simply way too long, and tantamount to ownership. So, after abandoning the request for 999-year leases, the military sought them for at least a ten-year period, the State Department wanted them for as long as a threat to the canal existed, and Arias wanted the bases back as soon as the war ended. Another controversial issue was the United States government's request to arm ships registered in Panama. The Battle of the Atlantic was taking its toll on the supply lines from America to Britain, and some of the ships were being sunk not long after exiting the canal. Because Panama was officially neutral at this point in the war, German U-boats could not legally attack Panamanian-flagged ships. President Arias refused to help, however, and American plans to use U.S.-owned ships flying a Panamanian flag to supply the British were interrupted. =President De la Guardia= A German Junkers Ju 52/3m, which was confiscated by Peru and transferred to the United States as a war prize, at Howard Field in late 1942. The aircraft was designated as a C-79 and given the serial 42-52883 while in United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) service. Arias' refusal to help the Allies by arming Panamanian ships, and his hard-line stance during the defense site negotiations led many in the United States government to conclude that \\"he had to go.\\" One man said the following about a possible American invasion to oust Arias: \\"The present conditions are considered dangerous to the security of the canal and it is believed that they should be corrected as soon as possible. A local revolution to throw out the crooked pro-Axis officialdom would be preferable to intervention by U.S. forces.\\" Shortly thereafter, on October 7, 1941, the Americans were granted their wish when a bloodless coup removed Arias from power. With Ricardo Adolfo de la Guardia as the new president, the defense site negotiations moved forward quickly and positively for the United States. Then the Japanese attacked the American naval base in Hawaii, which accelerated the process of negotiations even more. The new Panamanian government declared war on Japan on December 7, 1941, on the same day of the attack on Pearl Harbor, and a day before the United States officially entered the war. Panama then declared war on Germany and Fascist Italy on December 13, 1941, along with a few other Latin American states. On May 18, 1942, the United States and Panama finally signed an agreement for the lease of 134 sites to be used for the protection of the canal. The accord called for the occupation of the sites to end one year after the end of the war, and for the United States to pay $50 per hectare annually for the bases, except Rio Hato, for which it would pay $10,000 a year. Finally, Panama received promises for the completion of various public works projects, including the Rio Hato Road, the bridge over the canal, and a third set of locks for the canal itself. Ironically, in spite of De la Guardia's cooperation with the United States, throughout the war the American government refused repeated Panamanian requests for Lend-Lease assistance. A State Department official was quoted as saying: \\"[it was] desirable to keep something dangling before the noses of our Panamanian friends. There is no profit to us in giving the present administration all of the gravy.\\" However, in order to reward De la Guardia for his actions, and in order to bolster the president's position domestically, the United States provided the new government with hundreds of automatic weapons and pistols, boats, and other war materials, in addition to a permanent military mission to assist in training the Panamanian National Police. Some of the weapons provided by the United States were soon put to work in putting down an armed coup. In September 1943, a group of dissident police officers and civilians plotted a rebellion, but they were uncovered by loyal police shortly thereafter, and crushed accordingly. =President Jim√©nez= The end of the war in September 1945 brought about another misunderstanding between Panama and the United States. Although the peace treaty had not entered into effect, Panama demanded that ownership of the defense sites be relinquished, resting its claim on a subsidiary provision of the agreement permitting renegotiation after the cessation of hostilities. Overriding the desire of the War Department to hold most of the bases for an indefinite period, the State Department took cognizance of growing nationalist dissatisfaction and in December 1946 sent Ambassador Frank T. Hines to propose a twenty-year extension of the leases on thirteen facilities. President Enrique Adolfo Jim√©nez, who took office in June 1945, authorized a draft treaty over the opposition of the foreign minister and exacerbated latent resentment. When the National Assembly met in 1947 to consider ratification, a mob of 10,000 Panamanians armed with stones, machetes, and guns expressed opposition. Under these circumstances the deputies voted unanimously to reject the treaty. By 1948 the United States had evacuated all occupied bases and sites outside the Canal Zone. The upheaval of 1947 was instigated in large measure by university students. Their clash with the National Police on that occasion, in which both students and policemen were killed, marked the beginning of a period of intense animosity between the two groups. The incident was also the first in which American intentions were thwarted by a massive expression of Panamanian rage. =Defenses= The light cruiser USS Concord off Balboa, Panama, on January 6, 1943. In the 1930s, events and technological developments began to challenge the old axioms on which the defense of the canal had been based. A crippling attack aimed at the locks and dams, and delivered either by an act of sabotage or by naval bombardment, had always been considered the only real danger to be guarded against. Now, with the advent of modern aircraft carriers and long-range bombers, an attack by air quickly became the most serious threat to the canal's safety. The possibility of hostile forces establishing a beachhead and moving overland to the Canal Zone was not entirely discounted, but the absence of suitable landing places on the Atlantic side and the thick jungle of the Pacific lowlands were counted on to discourage any attack of this sort. The United States Army had disposed its defenses accordingly. Each end of the canal was heavily protected by a concentration of coastal artillery that at one time was regarded as the most powerful and effective of any in the world. In addition, the lock areas ‚Äì at Gatun, Pedro Miguel, and Miraflores ‚Äì were protected by land fortifications. The army had been given the mission of protecting the canal against sabotage and of defending it from positions within the Canal Zone. Close in defense was thus an army responsibility except for two specific tasks: that of providing an armed guard on vessels passing through the canal, and that of maintaining a harbor patrol at the entrances to the canal. Both of these tasks were entrusted to the United States Navy, along with its primary responsibility for offshore defense. The Air Corps forces in Panama were to be prepared to assist the navy in its main task of detecting and repelling enemy forces at sea, but only so far as air bases within the Canal Zone would permit, and only to an extent agreed upon by the local army commander. At the top of the military hierarchy was the commanding general of the Panama Canal Department. Directly under him were the commanders of the 19th Air Wing and of the two sectors, each one of which was independent of the other. In the years before and during World War II, American forces stationed in Panama were assigned to one of two sectors: The Atlantic Sector, initially with the 1st Coast Artillery Regiment and the 14th Infantry Regiment, guarded the northern (Atlantic) entrance of the canal, and the Pacific Sector, with the 4th Coast Artillery Regiment, the 33rd Infantry Regiment, and a battalion of the 2nd Field Artillery, guarded the southern (Pacific) end. In addition to the troops assigned to the sectors, certain units were directly under the commanding general of the Panama Canal Department. These department troops included air units ‚Äì the 19th Composite Wing, with about twenty-eight medium bombers, fourteen light bombers, twenty-four pursuit planes, and a few trainers and utility planes ‚Äì plus a regiment of combat engineers, together with Signal Corps, quartermaster, and ordnance units, and other service and administrative detachments. In 1939, the total strength of the garrison came to approximately 13,500 men. Over the next few years, the defenses in Panama were gradually improved, and the American population in the Canal Zone grew. At the height of the war, 65,000 American soldiers were stationed in Panama, plus tens of thousands of civilian employees and other military personnel. Among the new military infrastructure in Panama was an airbase, Howard Field, which was necessary for the operation of modern aircraft. Other facilities, such as Albrook Field, the naval base at Coco Solo, and the coastal defenses, were expanded and modernized. In spite of the heavy defenses, and the canal's importance to the Allied war effort, Panama never came under attack by the Axis, and the threat of one seemed to diminish more and more as the war progressed. Both the Germans and the Japanese did, however, develop plans to bomb the canal with aircraft deployed from submarines. The German plan, codenamed Operation Pelikan, was aborted for unknown reasons in late 1943, just after preparations had been completed. The Japanese operation was scheduled for mid-1945, but it was also aborted because by then the war was almost over, and so bombing the canal wasn't as urgent as stopping the American fleet that was advancing across the Pacific.

Youk Chhang (; born 22 January 1961) is the executive director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam) and a survivor of the Khmer Rouge's killing fields. He became DC-Cam‚Äôs leader in 1995, when the center was founded as a field office of Yale University‚Äôs Cambodian Genocide Program to conduct research, training and documentation relating to the Khmer Rouge regime. Chhang continued to run the center after its inception as an independent Cambodian non-governmental organization in 1997 and is currently building on DC-Cam‚Äôs work to establish the Sleuk Rith Institute, a permanent hub for genocide studies in Asia, based in Phnom Penh.  Early life  Chhang was born on 22 January 1961 in Tuol Kouk District, Phnom Penh, Cambodia. He was the youngest of nine children. His father was a gem merchant. On 17 April 1975, the day of the fall of Phnom Penh, Chhang was alone at home, and was separated from his family in the subsequent Khmer Rouge-ordered evacuation of the city. He walked to Takeo Province, knowing that his mother's home village was somewhere in the vicinity of Phnom Chisor. Villagers there sheltered him until his mother's arrival, without alerting the Khmer Rouge village chief to his presence, but after his mother's arrival, he and his family members were sent to a work camp in the country's northwest, in what is today Banteay Meanchey Province. After the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia, he returned to Phnom Penh, but then, at his mother's urging, fled Cambodia and snuck into neighbouring Thailand. He lived at the Khao-I-Dang refugee camp for several years until 1985 when he was chosen for resettlement in the United States, and after some time living at an orientation and training camp in the Philippines, he arrived in the United States in 1986.  Human rights work  Before leading DC-Cam, Chhang managed human rights and democracy training programs in Cambodia for the U.S.-based International Republican Institute and was an international staff member assisting the Electoral Component of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). From 1989 to 1992, he worked on crime prevention in Dallas, Texas. Chhang is a senior research fellow at the Center for the Study of Genocide, Conflict Resolution, and Human Rights at Rutgers University-Newark. He was a member of the eminent persons group who founded the Institute for International Criminal Investigations in The Hague in 2003. He is also a Board Trustee of Air Asia. Chhang is the author of several articles and book chapters on Cambodia‚Äôs quest for memory and justice and is the co-editor of Cambodia‚Äôs Hidden Scars: Trauma Psychology in the Wake of the Khmer Rouge (2011).  Awards  Chhang was the executive producer of a documentary film entitled A River Changes Course (2012), known as Kbang Tik Tonle in Khmer, about the changing social, economic, and environmental landscape in Cambodia. Among other awards, that film won the 2013 World Cinema Grand Jury Prize for documentaries at the Sundance Film Festival. He received the Truman-Reagan Freedom Award from the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington, DC in 2000. He was named one of Time magazine's \\"60 Asian heroes\\" in 2006 and one of the \\"Time 100\\" most influential people in the world in 2007 for his stand against impunity in Cambodia and elsewhere.

He received his education at Methodist College Belfast and, after he emigrated to New Zealand, at Prince Albert College in Auckland. On 15 November 1905, he married Amy Walker, the youngest daughter of mining engineer John Watson Walker, at Tararu near Thames. His wife was a cousin of Nellie Melba (their mothers were sisters), the Australian operatic soprano based in Europe who had an international career. On her tours in New Zealand, she would stay with the Alexanders when in Auckland. The Alexanders lived at Devonport and their house burned down at the end of 1913.

The rifle uses the Pneumatic Valve and Rod system, which was created as a more reliable design than the traditional direct gas impingement system of the AR-15 family. It was shown in a September 2011 issue of the magazine Baltimore Gun Club with a Seattle Sounders representative holding it. History United Defense Manufacturing Corporation undertook the development of the rifle as a possible replacement for traditional AR-15 designs which utilize a direct gas impingement system. Design The primary problems of the traditional Direct Gas Impingement system was its extreme heat as well as carbon deposits in the bolt assembly and bolt carrier group. The problems occur during the firing of a round, as in order to recycle the weapon's mechanisms, necessary force through high- pressured hot gases from the barrel's gas port are rammed back through a gas tube to the bolt assembly and bolt carrier group. As a result, wear and tear after a few thousand rounds become evident. Another problem was that of excessive recoil and muzzle rise, due mainly to the conventional high-powered rifle's high operating cyclic rate of fire (approximately 850-950 rounds per minute) and to the design itself whereby the hot compressed gases are rammed back into the bolt contributing to the recoil and muzzle rise. This results to cycling and reliability problems and firing accuracy issues. Simply put, due to its higher rate of fire and overall design, the rifle has a high tendency to jam and the soldier will have trouble controlling his aim when the rifle is fired in bursts or full automatic due to too much recoil and muzzle rise and flip to the ‚Äú1 or 2 o‚Äôclock‚Äù position. These problems were fixed by the PVAR rifle's system. Where in the Direct Gas Impingement System pressurized gas is used throughout the operating cycle, the UDMC PVAR System utilizes instead mechanical energy for more effective and more reliable cycling. The UDMC PVAR System prevents much heat, carbon build-up, un-burned powder, and dirt from being deposited inside the bolt assembly and the bolt carrier group, resulting in cleaner and cooler operation, less downtime for cleaning and repair, and considerably longer life span of the rifle. It can fire underwater and even accept successfully drum magazines. These advantages are offset by the cost of a reduced rate of fire from 900 to 750, although this can be addressed by attaching beta c-mags instead of normal STANAG mags. The PVAR itself is suited for high ammo magazines because of its ability to fire at high cyclical rates for sustained periods compared to direct gas impingement systems.

Drive Reduction Theory, developed by Clark Hull in 1943, was a major theory for motivation in the Behaviorist tradition.Dewey, R. (2007). Psychology: An introduction. Retrieved from http://www.intropsych.com/index.html Drive itself was defined as motivation that arose due to a psychological or physiological need; it has a variety of characteristics that include the intensifying or fueling of responses to a situation. As amount of drive is directly proportional to the intensity of the behavior that will result from it.Hull, C.L. (1952). A behavior system. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. It works as an internal stimulus that motivates the individual to move to sate the drive.Deckers, Lambert (2018). Motivation Biological, Psychological, and Environmental. New York, NY: Routledge. pp. 57‚Äì 60\\\\. . Additionally, it has been described as an internal and instinctual process that moves individuals to take actions that would allow them to attain their desired goal or end- state. It can also be understood to be the result of a lack of something physiological, as opposed to psychological needs, which are inherent in humans.Lambert, Deckers, (2018). Motivation biological, psychological, and environmental (5th edition ed.). New York: Routledge. pp. 42‚Äì43. . . Details According to such theorists as Clark Hull and Kenneth Spence, drive reduction is a major cause of learning and behavior. Primary drives are innate drives (e.g. thirst, hunger, and sex), whereas secondary drives are learned by conditioning (e.g. money). Doris Kraeling and Byron Campbell experimented to determine if ‚Äúreduction would be more effective as a reinforcer if the initial drive were low than if the initial drive were high.‚Äù Their findings are quite surprising: ‚ÄúChanges in stimuli are more discriminable at low levels of stimulus intensity than at higher levels of stimulus intensity‚Äù.Campbell, B., & Krealing, D. (1953). response strength as a function of drive level and amount of drive reduction. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 45, 97-101. Retrieved from https://pallas2.tcl.sc.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=pdh&AN;=xge-45-2-97&site;=ehost- live Multiple drives are what happen when an organism is faced with more than one need at the same time. Research has shown that this condition affects learning. In psychological vernacular ‚Äúgeneralized conditioned reinforce has greater learned reward value than a simple conditioned reinforce‚Äù.Wike, E., & Barrientos, G. (1958). secondary reinforcement and multiple drive reduction. Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology, 51, 640-643. Retrieved from https://pallas2.tcl.sc.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=pdh&AN;=com-51-5-640&site;=ehost- live These findings mean that multiple drives lead to quicker learning than a singular drive. There are several problems that leave the validity of drive theory open for debate. The first problem is that it does not explain how secondary reinforcers reduce drive. For example, money does not itself satisfy any biological or psychological need, but it reduces drive on a regular basis by a pay check. Secondly, drive reduction theory has trouble explaining why humans and other animals voluntarily increase tension by exploring their environments, even when they are not hungry or thirsty. There are also the complications to drive reduction theory caused by so-called \\"pleasure-seeking\\" behaviors, which seem to be contradictory to the theory's precepts. Why would an individual actively seek out more stimulation if it is already in a state of relaxation and fulfillment? A good example is when an individual leaves home to go to a potentially dangerous carnival. There is no base physiological drive to go to the carnival but the individual exhausts resources to go there. Judson Brown attempts to explain this phenomenon \\"the sensory consequences of most responses are practically never intense enough to provide increments to the drive level\\".Brown, J. (1955). pleasure-seeking behavior and the drive- reduction hypothesis. Psychological Review, 62, 169-179. Retrieved from https://pallas2.tcl.sc.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=pdh&AN;=rev-62-3-169&site;=ehost- live So the base physiological drive is vastly more powerful than other stimuli encountered. This makes sense because an organism will first learn to obtain food and water before it tries other more frivolous pursuits. Drive is essential in order for responses to occur (i.e., the student must want to learn). Stimuli and responses must be detected by the organism in order for conditioning to occur ( i.e., the student must be attentive). Response must be made in order for conditioning to occur (i.e., the student must be active). Conditioning only occurs if the reinforcement satisfied a need (i.e., the learning must satisfy the learner's wants). Clark Hull aimed to develop a learning theory that could be deduced mathematically. He created the \\"Mathematico Deductive Theory of Behavior:\\" sER = (V x D x K x J x sHr) ‚Äì (sIr + Ir) +/- sOr (Thomson, 1968). Theory of Motivational Readiness This is an expansion on the drive-incentive link (developed by Warden, it states that the individual's physiological needs will be coupled with a proportionate drive, thirst and water would be an example) in that it is the idea that affordances will satiate the wants of an individual. Affordances are the available resources that are present in an individual's environment, these would be at their disposal to use in order to obtain their desired end-state; the individual's environment, in which the affordances are located, is similar to Lewin's life space.Lewin, K. (1936). Principles of topological psychology (F. Heider & G. Heider, trans.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. The level of effectiveness a affordance is depends on what the want is. The properties of the affordance needs to be able to suit the characteristics that are needed in order to the want to be fulfilled.Deckers, Lambert (2018). Motivation Biological, Psychological, and Environmental. New York, NY: Routledge. pp. 50‚Äì 53\\\\. . For example, an individual, whose want is shelter from a hail storm, would not be satisfied if the affordance given was a miniature sized bag of gummy worms; in addition, the gummy worms would have quite a low expectancy due to its lack of ability to provide shelter. Additionally, based on Warden's drive-incentive link, it is also true that as either the drive or incentive increases, the behavior also increases.Warden, C. J. (1931). The Columbia Obstruction Method. In C. J. Warden (Ed.), Animal motivation: Experimental studies on the albino rat (pp. 3-16). New York, NY: Columbia University Press. According to Hull, due to the interconnected properties of drive and motivation, in the presence of a drive, the individual experiences discomfort; this discomfort gives them the motivation to dispel the need that is at the core of the drive. The emergence of the theory of motivational readiness comes from previous attempts of prominent individuals such as Warden, Lewin, Tolman, and Hull in order to explain the prevalence of how internal and external sources interact in order to influence motivation and behavior. This theory is dependent on the notion that individuals will have a want, and that they will take actions in order to obtain the want (it is expected that the individual will be able to obtain this want).Kruglanski, A. W., Chernikova, M., Rosenzweig, E., & Kopetz, C. (2014). On motivational readiness. Psychological Review, 121, 367-388. Wants can be any physiological or psychological need, such as the need for food; as an example, an individual can drive to Waffle House with the expectation that their hunger will be satiated by the fluffy omelets there. The theory of motivational readiness has come to be used in various professional settings. Motivational readiness is used in clinical settings, more specifically it has been prominent in studies involving exercise.Pint, B. M., Lynn, H., Marcus, B. M., DePue, J., & Goldstein, M. G. (2001, February 1). Physician-based activity counseling: Intervention effects on mediators of motivational readiness for physical activity. Annals of Behavioral Medicine, 23(1), 2-10. Additionally, it has been investigated in studies involving weight control, diet, and smoking.Marcus, B. H., Rakowski, W., & Rossi, J. S. (1992). Assessing motivational readiness and decision making for exercise. Health Psychology, 11(4), 257-261.Bock, B. C., Marcus, B. H., Rossi, J. S., & Redding, C. A. (1998).

Life He was the second son of David Murray of Balgonie, Fifeshire, by Agnes, daughter of Moncrieff of Moncrieff. He was educated at the University of St Andrews, where he graduated M.A. in 1618. In 1622 he was presented by his grandfather, Sir David Murray, 1st Viscount Stormont, to the church of Abdie, to which he was admitted on 1 October. On the death of his grandfather in 1631 he succeeded to the baronies of Arngask and Kippo in Fifeshire. During the visit of Charles I to Scotland for his coronation in 1633 he was, on 15 June, dubbed a knight at Seton. He was also the feudal Lord of Balvaird. Murray was the second of those who, in February 1638, signed the covenant in Greyfriars Church, Edinburgh. Although his name was also inserted as supporting the libel against the bishops in the same year, he may not have concurred with it. At a meeting of the assembly of the kirk in the same year, he, although not a member, tried modify the attitude of the extremists towards the king's proposals. The high commissioner, the Marquis of Hamilton, reported this to the king, and on 17 November 1641 Murray was created a peer by the title of Lord Balvaird. As a peer Balvaird attended a meeting of the convention of estates; but on 10 August 1643 it was decided by the assembly of the kirk that he should keep his ministry, and give up speaking in parliament. On the death of Mungo Murray, 2nd Viscount of Stormont in March 1642, Balvaird succeeded to the lands, lordship, and barony of Stormont, but not to the title. He died on 24 September 1644, aged about 47. Family By his wife Lady Elizabeth Carnegie, daughter of David Carnegie, 1st Earl of Southesk, he had five sons and three daughters.

He played college football at Memphis and signed with the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in 2012. He has also played for the Denver Broncos. On October 10, 2020, Leary announced his retirement. Early years Leary didn't start playing organized football until his junior year at Southern University Lab High School, where he earned All-State and All-District honors. He also lettered in basketball. He accepted a scholarship to play college football at The University of Memphis. As a redshirt freshman, he was a backup for the left and right tackle positions. The next year, he was named the starter at left tackle, where he would remain for the most part of his college career, while making 36 consecutive starts. During his senior season, he underwent surgery in May 2011 to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee, but didn't miss any games. He ended protecting three different quarterbacks, while starting the first six games at left tackle, before switching to right guard when injuries impacted the offensive line. He was named second-team All- Conference USA and shared team MVP honors with Dontari Poe. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Leary was not selected in the 2012 NFL Draft because of a degenerative left knee condition (osteochondritis dissecans) which could potentially shorten his career. He was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys with the intention of playing him at guard. To secure the signing that was seen as a coup, because he was graded as a third round talent,. the Cowboys gave him a $9,000 signing bonus and guaranteed $205,000 of his $390,000 base salary. He was waived on August 30, 2012 and signed to the team's practice squad. He was promoted to the active roster on December 21, for the last two games of the season. Leary entered the 2013 offseason competing for a starting job on the offensive line. He was getting first-team reps at left guard ahead of an injured Nate Livings, before needing arthroscopic surgery on his right knee during preseason. After missing two weeks, he returned in time to start in the season opener against the New York Giants and proceeded to start in all 16 games at left guard. In 2014, he earned the left guard starting role over Mackenzy Bernadeau and was a part of arguably the best offensive line in the NFL. His best game came against the Houston Texans, when he contained defensive player of the year J. J. Watt. He started in 15 games, missing one due to a groin injury. In 2015, Leary received competition from rookie La'el Collins. Although he suffered from a groin injury in training camp, Leary remained the starter at left guard in three of the first five games of the season, with his groin strain forcing him to miss the second and third games. Leary would be declared inactive for 10 straight games. He started in the last game against the Washington Redskins in place of an injured Collins, but left in the third quarter after suffering a concussion and was replaced by Mackenzy Bernadeau. In 2016, he held out during the offseason program and voluntary activities, while requesting a trade. Although the Cowboys received offers, they chose to decline them and kept Leary for depth. Although he was declared inactive in the first two games of the season, he saw extensive action at left guard in the third game against the Chicago Bears, after Collins was lost for the season with a torn ligament in his right big toe. He finished the season as the Cowboy's left guard. His inclusion on the offensive line, helped rookie Ezekiel Elliott win the NFL rushing title. He suffered a concussion in the fourth quarter against the Cleveland Browns and he did not play in the last game of the season due to a back injury. =Denver Broncos= On March 9, 2017, Leary signed a four-year, $36 million deal with the Denver Broncos with $20 million guaranteed. He was named the Broncos' starting right guard to begin the regular season. He started the first 11 games of the season before suffering a back injury in Week 12. He was placed on injured reserve on December 12, 2017. Leary was named the Broncos starting left guard to start the 2018 season. He started the first six games before suffering a torn Achilles in Week 6. He was placed on injured reserve on October 22, 2018. In 2019, Leary would move back to right guard, starting the first 12 games before missing the final four due to injury. After becoming a free agent in March 2020, Leary had a tryout with the Cleveland Browns on August 15, 2020.

The main target of the One Less Nuclear Power Plant was to cut energy consumption by 2 million TOE, which is equivalent to the capacity of one nuclear power plant, mainly by directly engaging citizens in energy-saving and renewable energy generation. This target was exceeded in June 2014, six months ahead of schedule, as Seoul reduced the city‚Äôs energy consumption by 2.04 million TOE. The Seoul Metropolitan Government announced the launch of the second phase of the One Less Nuclear Power Plant, Seoul Sustainable Energy Action Plan, in August 2014.  Key action plans  With ‚ÄúEnergy Generation, Energy Efficiency, and Energy-Saving,‚Äù at its core, the One Less Nuclear Power Plant took a multi-faceted approach, consisting of 71 specific projects in 6 policy categories, which can be re-categorized in 10 key action plans. The six policy categories include expanding renewable energy generation, improving building energy efficiency, promoting eco-friendly transportation system, generating green jobs, building a low energy-consuming city and creating a low energy- consuming civic culture.  Key achievements (as of June 2014)  The One Less Nuclear Power Plant presented set an example for local energy policies as it reached its target through unique means like Seoul Feed-in Tariff (FIT), and improved rent conditions for photovoltaic power generation. The significance of the One Less Nuclear Power Plant lies in the fact that it is a civic- participatory governance policy, under which citizens took the lead in policy development and implementation. The energy-saving programs achieved the greatest cut in energy consumption at some 910,000 TOE, while energy efficiency and generation projects pushed down the total energy consumption by 870,000 TOE and 260,000 TOE respectively. As a result, Seoul‚Äôs consumption of energy including electricity, city gas, and oil turned downward. In 2013, when tangible outcomes of the Ones Less Nuclear Power Plant started to surface, Seoul‚Äôs electricity consumption decreased by 1.4%, whereas the nationwide consumption jumped by 1.76%. = Energy generation = Under the One Less Nuclear Power Plant, the Seoul Metropolitan Government attracted of about 400 billion won in private capital to generate electricity from clean renewable sources that could be supplied to 300,000 households. 63.5 billion won out of the total private investment was used to establish 3,756 photovoltaic power generation systems with the combined capacity of 69 MW. = Energy efficiency = Seoul implemented Building Retrofit Program (BRP) on 20,000 buildings by offering loans with ultra-low interest rates of 1.75% and adopting a first- invest-return-later approach. Moreover, 6.79 million energy-efficient LED bulbs were introduced by Seoul. In particular, Seoul replaced 430,000 conventional bulbs in all 243 subway stations in the city with LED ones with the full financial support by the Korea Finance Corporation. = Energy-saving = The Eco-Mileage program, which incentives citizens‚Äô energy-saving actions, saw its membership increase to 1.7 million, prompting energy-saving behaviors both at households and businesses. The Eco-Mileage program won the 2013 UN Public Service Award in the category of ‚ÄúFostering participation in public policy decision making through innovative mechanisms.‚Äù  Brand identity  The brand identity (BI) of One Less Nuclear Power Plant was designed to reflect the vision of Healing city, Healing earth. The BI was a winning project from a civic competition, which was later retouched by Mr. Dong-min Ahn, the President of Intergram Graphics, local marketing design firm.  Slogan  :* Energy-saving people are the Green Power Plant that reduces one nuclear power plant :* Energy culture changed by citizens, happy transition by Seoul :* Energy saved together, One Less Nuclear Power Plant achieved together The slogans above were developed by citizens through a contest.  Mascot  Dongeuri the Sunlight Angel is the mascot of One Less Nuclear Power Plant, symbolizing the face of Seoul citizens who both save and generate energy.

He was the nephew of Andrew Cant, minister of Aberdeen. He graduated with an M.A. from King's College, Aberdeen, in 1626. He worked as tutor to George, Master of Ramsay. He was licensed by the Presbytery of Dalkeith 14 October 1630 on the recommendation of that of Alford, but left its bounds a fortnight after. He was admitted about 1637 and appointed in 1647 a member of committee to revise the Psalter. He was present at Mauchline Moor in opposition to the royal army in June 1648. He was subsequently pardoned by Parliament on 16 January 1649. Nevay was appointed a commissioner by Parliament for visiting the University of Aberdeen 31 July 1649. He was active in raising the western army in 1650, and in 1651 a prominent supporter of the Protesters. In 1654 he was named by the Council of England on a committee for authorising admissions to the ministry in the province of Glasgow and Ayr. On 23 December 1662 he was banished by the Privy Council from His Majesty's dominions and went to Holland, where he died in 1672, aged about 66. Personal life He was a man of great zeal though somewhat violent and did not object to the execution of the Macdonald prisoners taken at Dunaverty. He married Ann Sharp, widow of Robert Halyburton, merchant, Edinburgh; she survived him, and had issue ‚Äî a son. Life A nephew of Andrew Cant, Nevay entered King's College, Aberdeen in 1622, and graduated M.A. in 1626. For some time he was tutor to the Master of Ramsay; and on the recommendation of the presbytery of Alford he was licensed as a preacher of the kirk of Scotland by the presbytery of Dalkeith on 14 October 1630. In 1637 he was admitted minister of Newmilns in Ayrshire, and he was chosen a member of the general assemblies of 1646, 1647, and 1649. Nevay was opposed to all forms of set prayer in public worship, objecting to the use of the Lord's Prayer, the Gloria Patri, and the repeating of the creed at baptism. In the assembly of 1647 he was appointed to revise Francis Rous's version of the last thirty psalms, with a view to the adoption of the collection by the assembly. Nevay joined the Whigamores at Mauchline in June 1648. His conduct, with that of others who took part in the raid, was absolved by an act of parliament passed in the following January. In July 1649 he was named one of the commissioners for visiting the university of Aberdeen. In 1650 he took an active part in raising the western army, composed of Covenanters. On the division of the church in 1651 into two parties, the \\"resolutioners\\" and the \\"protesters\\", Nevay sided with the protesters, who abjured Charles II, and claimed for the spiritual power an extensive jurisdiction over civil matters. In 1654 he was named by the English Council of State one of those for authorising admissions to the ministry in the province of Glasgow and Ayr. After the Restoration of 1660, Nevay was on 11 December 1661 banished by the privy council from Charles II's dominions, and went to Holland. On 20 July a demand by the English government for his expulsion, along with Robert Macuard and Robert Traill, was laid before the states of Holland, and on 23 September placards were issued, stating that they were sentenced to leave the Dutch territory within fifteen days under pain of being prosecuted as \\"stubborn rebels\\".

The first multi-level parking garage in Berlin, and considered to be one of few existing examples of industrial Bauhaus architecture, it is registered as an historic building and is still used for car parking, although its future is in doubt.  Background and design  Kant-Garage was designed by architect Hermann Zweigenthal (also known as Hermann Herrey) and Richard Paulick in collaboration with entrepreneur and engineer Louis Serlin. The engineering of the design was the creation of the firm Lohm√ºller, Korschelt & Renker. It is a six-storey garage with 300 parking spots, 200 of which were designed as boxes with steel doors to meet fire regulations. The back of the building is covered with a curtain wall. The ramp-system of the garage ‚Äì a double-helix ramp, also known as a double-spiral ramp ‚Äì was the first of its kind in Germany. Today, it is considered unique as the oldest garage with this style of ramp in Europe, and the second oldest in the world. The garage was registered as an historic monument in 1991, and is considered an important example of inter-war automotive architecture. Its future is uncertain as its owner has applied for it to be demolished.

Beginning with a single frame published at midnight on March 25, 2013, the image was updated every 30 minutes until March 30, 2013, and then every hour for 118 days (123 days in total), ending on July 26 with a total of 3,099 unique images. Each image represented a single frame in a larger story. The strip's story, set 11,000 years in the future in the basin of the Mediterranean Sea during a supposed recurrence of the Zanclean flood, features two characters journeying uphill to discover where the rising water is originating. By the end of the story, the characters return home to save their people. Described by Glen Tickle of Geekosystem as Munroe's \\"magnum opus\\", \\"Time\\" attracted significant attention and was well received online; several projects, wikis and web communities were built about it. In 2014, it won the Hugo Award in the Best Graphic Story category. Plot \\"Time\\" begins with two stick figures, a woman and a man, building a sand castle complex on a beach. The woman notes that the sea (visible on the right side of the frame) is rising. After construction is completed, and after temporarily stopping the sea from eroding the castle away, the two decide to go on a journey to discover the cause behind the rising sea level. As they leave, the frames slowly fade to white, as the rising water begins to destroy the castle. The two journey out, finding a river that they were unaware of; the couple follow the river and make observations as they go. While resting under a tree, the man finds the remains of a campsite, discovering that the area they were in had been inhabited. Later, they find another campsite and massive, oddly shaped trees with markings on one. They find a decrepit boat they could use to cross the river, but continue up into the mountains. While climbing a small hill, the man sees a snake and tumbles down on the woman. Further on, they hear chirping in a tree, and pause briefly to observe a bird and its chick in a nest. While resting at a miniature river, the woman discovers that they are on the cliff of a large waterfall. After contemplating it, they decide to discover what the mountains are like. They climb up and eventually reach a small abandoned house. While there, the man is attacked by a big cat, which the woman routs with a piece of wood. The man is unscathed, but the woman sustains a wound to her leg, which they wrap with a flag brought from when they were creating the sand castle. They decide that traveling in search of people towards the top of the mountain (where they see a structure) would be a better medical option than heading back home, so they continue towards the mountaintops. As night falls, they rest in the wild. The man takes the first guard shift, and the stars in the night sky time-lapse behind him. He wakes the woman to take his turn to sleep. When he eventually wakes up, the two characters press on with the intention of turning back if they do not find people. Frame 2,915 from the comic, during the discussion with one of the natives. In this frame, she reveals herself as their leader. They find a small structure, and from its top the woman spots people. As they leave the structure, they think of their sand castle, wondering about its fate. The screen cuts to a scene of a lone bucket floating on a body of water, then cuts back. After more traveling, the characters make contact with three androgynous people wearing headgear. The woman attempts to communicate, but the native language of the people is incomprehensible. She shows them her wound, and they treat it with a paste. The group then beckon the man and woman to follow them into town. After receiving water, the man and woman sleep. The following morning, the man communicates with one of the locals by drawing pictures in the dirt. The local informs them that the sea level is, in fact, rising, and that the two characters should follow and see someone to talk to. They rest along the way, where the man and woman look over a map from one of the locals. They continue to a city, and there is a castle behind it. They are led to the natives' leader who, speaking the language of the protagonists, explains the reason for the sea rising. She reveals that her people had erected a berm to keep what she calls \\"the planet's mightiest river\\" at bay, which is days away from breaking through and flooding the man and woman's home. She explains that the journey back to reach their home to warn the others living there would take too long and that they have no choice but to remain with the mountain people. Ignoring her, the man and woman flee and run back home, taking some of the mountain people's provisions on the way out and guiding themselves with maps that the woman had stolen. Upon returning home, the two characters attempt to coordinate an escape with their own people. A girl appears in a boat she constructed from wood used in the sand castle from the beginning of the story; this causes the tribe to abandon their original plans and instead attempt to float up the river. After expanding the boat, the group boards it and sets sail. Soon they join the remaining members of their tribe, who had been in their own smaller boat. After a night of drifting, while the others are still asleep, the man and woman spot land. When they reach it, the story ends with the man and woman, last to depart, going into the new wilderness to explore it, with the boat seen bobbing in the water. The final five frames of the comic, in which the boat is bobbing on the water, are currently rotating in an undetermined pattern for the comic on the xkcd website. Conception and development Webcomic creator Randall Munroe described his reasons for creating \\"Time\\" in an interview with Rolling Stone, where he stated that he came up with the idea as he was pondering the space between animation and a daily comic, wanting to do something \\"in between\\". In an interview with Computer Sweden, Munroe stated that he had never seen anyone attempt such a project before and that he \\"wanted to see if it would work.\\" Munroe noted that, in some cases, \\"things become more interesting if they are difficult to access,\\" such as in books that deliberately make the story more complicated. He hoped that, as people slowly got into it, the world and language would excite readers on a deeper level. According to Munroe, nothing like \\"Time\\" had been done before because it is difficult to reach people once every hour without a tool such as the Internet. Following the ending of his story, Munroe explained many of its details and furthered its context in an article on Wired. He noted that \\"Time\\" is set 11,000 years in the future, in a future civilization with humanity's present civilization long extinct. It takes place in the basin of the Mediterranean Sea, which has largely evaporated following tectonic activity shutting it off from the Atlantic Ocean. This is modeled after a similar occurrence of this incident approximately 5 million years ago‚Äîthe Messinian salinity crisis. The eventual flooding crisis at the end of the story is a supposed recurrence of the Zanclean flood. Munroe reportedly researched the plants and wildlife of the region and added them into the comic, offering hints as to the story's location. According to Munroe, \\"I got suggestions from botanists and herpetologists, and I had a file with details on every species the characters encountered or talked about, like dwarf palms, juniper trees, horned vipers, and sand boas\\". In the scene where the male and female sleep in shifts, a time lapse of stars in the night sky occupies the background. This was done with the help of astronomy software to render the night sky of the characters' location, in their specific time, accounting for projected precession of the equinoxes and stellar motion over the next 11,000 years. The starfield lacks the star Antares, as Munroe consulted with astronomer Phil Plait, who told him that the star may go supernova before the date in which \\"Time\\" is set. =Language= The mountain natives' language (and the script it is written in) was created with the help of a linguist, and has not been deciphered, although the meaning of some of the words and symbols have been deduced.Deciphering Beanish  ·ñâ, ·ñÜ·ê£·ñö·î≠,·ê¶ Munroe has not given the language a name, but fans dubbed it \\"Beanish\\" (deriving from the natives' beanie-like hats), a name that was later picked up by the media. Munroe has opened the possibility of using the language in a future comic. Publishing The frames of \\"Time\\" were originally updated every 30 minutes; however, after frame 240, the updates became hourly. After frame 2440, five frames appeared in quick succession,FAQ - xkcd Timeframes showing a meteor shooting through the sky, but the updates then returned to hourly. The technical details about the comic's publishing were described on an independent website as follows: Reception \\"Time\\" was received well online, with Cory Doctorow of Boing Boing saying it was \\"coming along nicely\\" during publishing with an \\"astounding backstory\\" upon its conclusion. Wireds Laura Hudson called the journey \\"epic\\", and Glen Tickle of Geekosystem referred to the comic as Munroe's \\"magnum opus\\". Tasha Robinson from The A.V. Club said of the comic, \\"This is slow-paced entertainment for a fast-paced world, but it's also the kind of nifty experiment that keeps people coming back to XKCD, which at its best isn't a strip comic so much as an idea factory and a shared experience.\\" \\"Time\\" also got mentions from The Verge writer Jeff Blagdon and Washington Post blogger Andrea Peterson. In August 2014 the comic won the Hugo Award in the Best Graphic Story category. Doctorow accepted the award on behalf of Munroe, dressing as Munroe had drawn him in earlier strips \\"Blagofaire\\" and \\"1337: Part 5\\". The comic garnered \\"obsessive\\" attention from viewers on xkcds forum, with a discussion thread that exceeds 2,500 pages and 100,000 posts. Fans created a wiki specific to \\"Time\\", and a glossary of invented terms to describe the comic.

Muller, Tremblay and Tessier drove the car in the race, but retired after 253 laps due to engine failure; however, they completed more laps than three of the finishers. For 1994, the car was updated into the LMP294, and Bruno Miot was selected to drive it in the 1994 24 Hours of Le Mans test session; he set a time good enough for 19th overall, and second in the LMP2 category. For the race, Georges Tessier, Pascal Dro and Bernard Santal were selected to drive the car; this time, an accident forced the team to retire after 79 laps. The car was not raced again for four years, until R.D.C. Schweiz entered Josef Pfyl in the Most round of the Interserie in 1998; the car had been reverted to the SP93 specification, and was classified in the Div.II-Euroserie category. Pfyl was able to finish 15th overall in the first heat, and eleventh in class; this was not fast enough for him to compete in the second heat, and the chassis was never used again.

Murray Publishing Company, is an Australian publisher primarily known for its publication of DC reprint comics. Established in 1936 in Sydney, Australia by Ken 'K.G.' Murray, the company was a family-owned and run business until its sale to Australian Consolidated Press in 1973. History Murray had previously worked in advertising for Gordon and Gotch, an Australian magazine distributor. Murray's first publication was Man, a men's magazine, in December 1936. It was printed on heavy art paper with thick, glossy card covers and squared spine. The 100 page magazine sold for the price of two shillings. In 1936 K.G. Murray issued a pocket-sized magazine, Man Junior, a 96-page publication which sold for a shilling and contained no advertising. this was followed by The Insider, a serious foreign affairs journal (which was relatively short-lived), and Cavalcade, a more general-focus news digest. In 1938 K.G. Murray launched the Digest of Digests. The commencement of World War II forced the suspension of Man Junior and Cavalcade, leaving only Man and Digest of Digests as K.G. Murray's only on-going publications. When the war ended Man Junior and Cavalcade resumed publication, but The Insider fell by the wayside. In 1946 K.G. Murray introduced Adam a pulp magazine of action, sport and adventure stories. The magazine blossomed over time and became noted for its lurid painted covers ‚Äì many by Phil Belbin and Jack Waugh ‚Äì featuring semi-naked women in various brands of peril. In 1951 K.G. Murray was acquired by Publishers Holdings Ltd, a company which was then floated on the Australian Stock Exchange. In the 1950s Man and its stablemates came under terrible pressure as American girlie magazines flooded the Australian market. By then K.G. Murray had diversified into a range of titles covering a range of highly specialised areas of reader interest, ranging from hunting and fishing to motor racing and farming. K.G. Murray also increased its number of men's magazine titles publishing Gals and Gags, Man's Life, Adventure Story and Man's Master Detective. On 1 February 1972, Kenneth Murray retired as Managing Director while remaining on the Board until 1974. On 30 June 1973, Australian Consolidated Press Ltd completed an acquisition and took control of the company. In 1974 Man magazine ceased publication. Comics In the late 1930s the Australian comic market began to be saturated by the release of reprints of US strips popularised by the women's magazines, The New Idea and The Woman's Mirror, together with reprints of Sunday pages and supplements, printed overseas at minimal cost. By 1939 there were political protests about the dumping of overseas magazines and comics in Australia, on behalf of the local industry and in June 1940 the Australian Government placed a ban on the importation of American comics and overseas syndicated reprints. After the end of World War II, paper rationing was eased and US publication embargoes lifted. In 1946, K.G. Murray took advantage of these new opportunities and began publishing original Australian black and white comics. These included Flameman (c.1946), a superhero strip by Moira Bertram,. High Compression (c.1947), an Italian Grand Prix mystery drawn by Albert De Vine and The Lost Patrol (c.1946), an adventure set in postwar New Guinea, written and drawn by Hart Amos. In 1947, Murray introduced full colour content to Australian comics with Climax All Color Comic. The format was costly, but it established KG Murray and put pressure on its competitors. Early issues of Climax included Zatara tales (from US Action Comics), Murray's first DC super-hero reprints. K.G. Murray also began publishing other US reprints such as Blackhawk and Captain Triumph. These characters whilst now associated with DC, were only acquired by DC after Quality Comics folded in 1956. In mid-1947, Murray launched its first full DC reprint title, Superman All Color Comic, and went on to dominate the Australian comic reprint field. The series set new comic sales records in Australia, selling 150,000 copies at its peak. Within two years, the Color Comic description became the legendary branding for Australian black and white DC reprints. In 1949, Adventure Comics featuring Superboy was launched, but retitled Superboy from issue 6. The series reprinted the US Adventure Comics and Superboy. Further new titles, Batman Comics (soon retitled Batman) and Super Adventure Comic, followed in mid-1950. Batman reprinted stories from Batman and Detective Comics, while Super Adventure Comic included Superman and Batman tales from World's Finest Comics, alongside Superboy stories K.G. Murray also published reprints of DC Comics under a range of imprint titles including Climax Comics, Blue Star, Planet Comics and Murray Comics. In 1959 the Australian government lifted import restrictions and US publications became available in Australia, resulting in the demand for locally produced American-style periodicals declining. In 1973, Murray was acquired by Australian Consolidated Press (ACP) the publishing arm of the Packer empire. In 1974, Kerry Packer took control of ACP following his father's death. In 1979 a new short-lived \\"Murray Publishers\\" logo appeared, which was revamped into the \\"Murray the Cat\\" branding in mid-1980. In 1983, Kerry Packer purchased back all of the shares in ACP and turned it into a private company, selling the comics division to Federal Publishers.

The region runs from west- central Texas through west-central Oklahoma, central Kansas, and south-central Nebraska. It is designated as the Central and Southern Mixed Grasslands ecoregion by the World Wildlife Fund. Geography This large grassland area with very few trees runs north‚Äìsouth from central Nebraska through central Kansas and western Oklahoma to north-central Texas, covering 282,000 km2. It is a transition zone between the Central tall grasslands and Central forest- grasslands transition ecoregions to the east and the Western short grasslands to the west, while to the north lie the Northern mixed grasslands, which have a cooler temperature and a much shorter growing season. Environment =Flora= The prevalent vegetation of the Central Great Plains ecoregion is a rich mixture of prairie mixed grasses of medium height. The ecoregion is encompassed by the tallgrass and shortgrass prairies. Wildflowers occur among the grasses, but very few trees and shrubs do. The grasslands are heavily grazed and frequently disturbed by drought and fire. Other vegetation is drought-tolerant species honey mesquite and prickly pear cacti. =Fauna= The Central Great Plains prairie is part of the historical native rangeland of the Great Plains endemic American bison. It has been converted for use as grazing land for cattle since the 19th century. The grasslands are home habitat for a resident prairie birds, while the wetlands of the region are important stopovers for birds migrating between North America and Mexico. The Cheyenne Bottoms near Great Bend, Kansas, and the Platte River in Nebraska are particularly important for migrating sandhill cranes and other waders. The region is home to a large number of reptiles. Some of the prevalent wildlife in the southern area are coyotes, striped bark scorpions, rattlesnakes, and common house geckos. =Conservation= Most of the grasslands have been converted for agriculture, with only about 5% of natural habitat remaining. Indeed, this area was so heavily overcultivated that it was damaged during the 1930s Dust Bowl period in which the topsoil was blown away in dust storms. The grasslands have since recovered, but are cropland and managed grazing ranges rather than unspoiled native grasses and perennials pasture. Protected areas The small remaining blocks of intact habitat include: *Oklahoma ‚Äî the Wichita Mountains, and the Great Salt Plains Lake in Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge *Nebraska ‚Äî the Platte River State Park near Louisville, Nebraska, and the Rainwater Basins to the south *Kansas ‚Äî the Cheyenne Bottoms, the Quivira National Wildlife Refuge near the town of Stafford, the Red Hills, and the Smoky Hills areas These protected areas consist of patches of intact native grassland amid cultivated rangeland, and most of the remaining natural habitats of the Great Plains are unprotected. The two largest protected areas are the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge for bison and black-capped vireo, and the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge.

Its purpose was to address issues relating to improvement in the circumstances of the economically- and socially-deprived Dalit and Tribal communities of the state. The immediate outcome was the Bhopal Declaration which included a Dalit Agenda that has been described by Sudha Pai as \\"... a new effort to address the problems faced by Dalits and Tribals in keeping with liberalisation and the emergence of a competitive market economy.\\" The results significantly influenced the policies of the then Chief Minister, Digvijay Singh, and caused the state to experience a markedly different style of Dalit politics to that which was typical in the neighbouring Belt areas, such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Background There were many expert attendees of the Conference, which was held in the Vidhan Sabha building of Bhopal, the state capital of Madhya Pradesh, and was organised by the state government. A key aim, as set out in the pre-Conference working note known as the Bhopal Document, was to examine how to uplift Dalit people by recourse to new ways of thinking that relied less on the prevailing concept of job reservation as a remedy for socio-economic depression. That concept had been promoted by B. R. Ambedkar and other Dalit intellectuals around the period when India became an independent nation and it was reliant upon a Marxist-based model of government economic intervention with a large public sector that, by the 1990s, was not sustainable and was being replaced by neoliberalism. Modern Dalit intellectual activists ‚Äî notably, the journalist Chandra Bhan Prasad ‚Äî had realised this and were campaigning for a strategy of \\"Dalit capitalism\\" that extended the requirement to reserve jobs into the private sector and also sought to empower Dalits by promoting an environment that would enable them to be business owners rather than reliant on others for employment. While some Dalits were already non-reliant because of their involvement in traditional occupations such as toddy tapping, those roles were under threat from globalisation. Outcome The Declaration that was agreed by the Conference proposed that the state \\"democratise capital\\" by allocating funds for the Dalit and Tribal communities that would enable them to invest both in developing their skills and their opportunities to enter the free market economy. It wanted compulsory, free education and a rearrangement of land ownership so that families had sufficient for sustainable cultivation. Furthermore, it appealed for both the public and the private sector to embrace the concepts of \\"Supplier Diversity\\" and \\"Dealership Diversity\\" that would ensure a market for the output of Dalit capitalism. Other aspects included a desire to see the job reservation scheme extended to encompass the Indian judiciary, an end to manual scavenging, a full application in spirit as well as law of the 1989 Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, and recognition of the particular problems faced by women of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes. The 21 points that formed the Declaration were subsequently examined in more detail by specialist committees that were established for that purpose. Their remit was to propose strategies based upon the principles that had been declared. Those proposals were submitted to the Government of Madhya Pradesh, which accepted them on the first anniversary of the Conference in 2003. Recognition The principles contained in the Declaration had already been acknowledged by K. R. Narayan, then President of India and himself a Dalit, in his official Address to the Nation on the eve of Republic Day, 25 January 2002, when he said References Notes Citations Bibliography  * * Category:Dalit politics Category:2002 conferences Category:Bhopal Category:Politics of Madhya Pradesh ","title":"Bhopal Conference"},{"id":"40157130","text":"Statue of Minerva on the Alte Br√ºcke in Heidelberg As patron goddess of wisdom, Minerva frequently features in statuary, as an image on seals, and in other forms, at educational establishments, including: *Minerva is featured on the seals and logos of many institutions of higher learning around the world: **University of Lincoln.

Their Double A-side A Wise Man Said / Back to Yours was released on 12 February 2016, having already gained radio airplay from BBC Radio 1, BBC 6 Music, Radio X and Amazing Radio and being named This Feeling's Track of the Day in January 2016. This was followed up by the release of a single track 'Who R Ya?' in collaboration with 1234 Records In December 2016, Sisteray signed to Independent Label, Vallance Records. Their first release on the label was '00:01:57 Faaast Food' on 24 February 2017. This was followed up by 5 track EP '15 Minutes' on 14 April, peaking at 22 in the iTunes charts. The project title, '15 Minutes', refers to Andy Warhol's famous \\"15 minutes of fame\\" statement. The material was recorded with Rory Attwell at Lightship 95. The band explain: \\"Now more than ever, people seem to be given 15 minutes and 15 minutes only. It's not an album and it‚Äôs not a single. It's simply a statement about the times we are living in...\\" The release saw the bands popularity grow, having been championed by BBC Radio 1, Radio X, BBC 6 Music, Louder Than War, Fred Perry and Clash. The band went on to play Camden Rocks and Reading festival that same year, followed by sold out shows in Sheffield and London. The band run a regular club night called Welcome to the Monkey House at various venues in London. The club night has grown in popularity and has seen the band open internationally, with two Paris nights. In 2018, the band announced a new 4-track EP titled 'Sisteray Said' was released in September, following a sold out show at London's Dingwalls. The EP gained notable press, with Louder Than War describing \\"Sometimes when you hear a band for the first time you know that there is just that little ‚Äòje ne sais quoi‚Äô about them. Something that sets them aside slightly, something that makes you sit up and pay attention as they distance themselves from the rest of their counterparts. Yes, you‚Äôve guessed it, Sisteray are one such band.\\" The EP was peaked at number 9 in the iTunes chart. Notable performances at Isle of Wight Festival, Camden Rocks Festival, Tramlines, The Great Escape and a live streamed Pirate Studios session on Facebook; along with a performance live on Radio X and a series of radio plays has seen the bands popularity grow significantly. The band toured the new EP in October and November of 2018, concluded with a sold out show at London's famous The 100 Club, which was attended by former England defender Stuart Pearce, after championing the band on TalkSport. On April Fools day, 1 April 2019, premiered their new Brexit themed single 'April Fools' on John Kennedy's Radio X show. Musical style Sisteray are influenced by 1970s punk era bands such as the Buzzcocks, the Gun Club and the Clash. Other influences include the Smiths, Nirvana and the Pogues. Sisteray have also cited John Cooper Clarke and Patti Smith as influences on their music.

The film stars Zhang Ziyi, Takeshi Kaneshiro, Song Hye-kyo, Huang Xiaoming, Tong Dawei and Masami Nagasawa. The film is based on the sinking of the steamer \\"Taiping\\" in 1949. The incident led to the deaths of over 1,500 passengers and crew. The film's first part was released in China on December 2, 2014. Part two was released on July 30, 2015.  Plot  Part 1: In a battle between the Chinese National Revolutionary Army and the Imperial Japanese Army in Manchuria during World War II, Major general Lei Yifang (Huang Xiaoming) personally leads an attack over the objections of his subordinates. The charge overruns Japanese lines and wins the day; Dr. Yen Zekun (Takeshi Kaneshiro), an ethnic Chinese field medic conscripted into the Japanese army from then-Japanese Taiwan, is captured. Lei is promoted to lieutenant general, while Dr. Yen is shipped off to a prison camp in Fengtian. On the POW train, Yen reads a letter from his Japanese paramour Masako (Masami Nagasawa). A few years later during the resumption of the Chinese Civil War, Yu Zhen (Zhang Ziyi), a poor, illiterate young woman volunteers as an orderly at a Nationalist hospital in Shanghai. She dreams of reuniting with her boyfriend Yang Tianhu, who is off fighting the Communists. Meanwhile, General Lei catches the eye of wealthy debutante Zhou Yunfen (Song Hye-kyo) at a charity event put on by her father Zhou Zhongding and mother Yuan Shenglan. Despite her mother's warnings not to accept the attention of soldiers, she dances with Lei, their chemistry obvious for the entire room to see; months later, they marry. The next year, Yu Zhen meets signal corps Captain Tong Daqing outside of the same photography studio Lei and Zhou used for their wedding. Captain Tong has hired Yu and a borrowed baby to have a photograph taken together as a family as proof of marriage, which would provide his parents at home with more food rations. After they take the photos, a student anti-war protest in front of the studio is violently dispersed by police and soldiers. During the chaos, Dr. Yen enters the photography studio, presents separate photos of himself and Masako, and asks the proprietor to create an altered photo that will make it look like he and her were in a photo together. Tong and Yu take refuge in a noodle shop, where Tong talks about why he joined the army. Yu asks about the Republic of China Army's soldier identification numbers. Tong tells her that as long as she knows his ID number, she will be able to find him, dead or alive. She smiles, thinking of her lover, but Tong misinterprets this as her having feelings for him. Tong, late for his departure, boards a truck with the rest of his unit and tells Yu to memorize his unit number. Yu returns to the photography studio and orders a copy of the picture of her with Tong and \\"their\\" baby. Zhou, now pregnant, tells General Lei that she has reservations about his plans to send her away to Taiwan. He quiets her fears, though she asks him not to see her off out of superstition. Zhou's parents see her and her sister off on the Taiping, along with many of Shanghai's elite. Zhou has her cousin take a picture of her, capturing Lei in the background as he has come in secret to watch her departure before he leaves for the front. Captain Tong is admiring his 'family portrait' when his fellow troops notice how pretty his 'wife' is. They pass the photo around and listen, rapt as Tong spins yarns about Yu. Meanwhile, Yu struggles to get employment and is seen eating discarded fruit and sleeping under a bridge. Dr. Yen, who was on the Taiping with the Zhou sisters, disembarks with them at the Port of Keelung in Taiwan, where they are greeted with a military band and Nationalist flags lining the streets. He explains to an official that he was in Shanghai procuring medical supplies for his practice. The official, seeing that he is a native of Taiwan, asks where Yen learned the GuƒÅnhu√† he is conversing in instead of the local language, Taiwanese Hokkien. After the questioning, Yen meets his brother and returns to his family home. His mother, a midwife, is burning letters sent to Yen by Masako. Zhou arrives at a Japanese-style estate, where she is welcomed by A-man, the Taiwanese maid. She starts to pen a letter to her husband. Yu enters a boardinghouse in Shanghai. The landlady isn't looking to rent to single women, but Yu says she is married, using the photo of her and Captain Tong as evidence, and Yu is granted a place to stay. She then gets a hometown acquaintance of hers to bring her to work as a dancing girl at a club. Her friend reads aloud a letter from Yu's boyfriend before a big battle some four months ago. Her friend advises Yu that her boyfriend may be dead by now, and that romance won't keep her fed. Upon arriving at the dance club, they find that the city government has shut down the club in order to conserve energy for the war effort. The dancing girls, now out of work, protest but are roughly treated by baton- wielding police. Yu escapes from the fracas and starts a career of prostitution to secure enough money to travel to Taiwan in hopes of finding her missing lover. The drunken johns are noisy and waken the rest of the boardinghouse. Lei's 12th Army is nearing encirclement during the Huaihai Campaign, and their supply lines have been cut. He orders a breakout towards Yongcheng, but an order comes in countermanding him to hold his position. He angrily goes to his headquarters, where his commanding general tells him that two recent breakout efforts have badly failed, likely due to the People's Liberation Army getting wind of the plans. Lei laments how he has returned to the same battlegrounds he fought on against the Japanese, only this time his men were dying against their countrymen instead of against foreign invaders. Back in Taiwan, Zhou goes to replace a painting in her music room with one of her wedding day. In doing so, she discovers Masako's diary along with some original sheet music, revealing that this house is the one once occupied by Masako. While mediating a dispute between A-man and her manservant, Zhou collapses, bitten on the ankle by a snake. She is rushed to a doctor, who happens to be Yen. Zhou recognizes his name from the painting Masako's diary was concealed behind. Zhou asks Dr. Yen to meet in private, and they do so at a lighthouse. She shows him Masako's diary, expressing that she wants to use Masako's sheet music as the beginning of the song she wants to write for her husband Lei. Zhou asks Yen to tell her about Masako for inspiration, thus starting a friendship anchored by their shared longing for a distant beloved. Yen explains he met Masako as they were both artists, and that his mother sold Masako's mother the piano now belonging to Zhou after his father's death. His mother and the other local Taiwanese never much approved of his relationship with Masako, as she was one of the colonizers. Captain Tong is penning a letter to Yu in the trenches when General Lei comes by and asks Tong to help fix his radio. After Tong succeeds in doing so, the two bond over their family photos. In the Communist camp, the local populace arrives with food and supplies for the soldiers, whose morale is greatly increased. At the same time, the Nationalist soldiers are starving. Unable to see his soldiers suffer, General Lei shoots his own warhorse for meat. Captain Tong, out on patrol with an enlisted soldier local to the area, shoots a rabbit but finds himself held at gunpoint by a Communist soldier. They manage to come to a truce, and the three of them eat the rabbit. The Nationalists are subject to propaganda blaring from the Communist trenches, which also serves to cover the sounds of Communist sappers tunneling through the trenches. Lei, angry, rouses his troops and sends Captain Tong off to figure out why the 108th Division has been incommunicado. Tong and his enlisted companion drive down the wire, stopping to connect their phone and try the 108th, which does not answer. Communist general Liu Zhiqing, an old acquaintance of Lei's, arrives at Lei's command post for a parley. He advises Lei to surrender, but Lei refuses. Tong runs into a checkpoint guarded by the 108th Division and realizes that they have defected to the Communists. He convinces them not to kill him or hold him hostage, quickly returning to the rest of the 12th Army. When he goes to make his report, his companion, who has also defected, holds him at gunpoint. Tong turns his back to his companion and encourages him to shoot, but his companion cannot do it. Lei finally receives the order to break out. He gathers his officers and announces that no one is obligated to stay and fight, but they all choose to remain with him. As the fight begins, Captain Tong reports to General Lei and asks to be court-martialed. Lei doesn't understand why until he mutters that they can win if the 108th joins the fray now, and Tong explains that the 108th has deserted. Lei pulls his Browning Hi-Power and holds it to Tong's temple, but ends up handing Tong's rifle back to him and exhorting Tong to fight on. As the Communists burst through and start to overrun the Nationalist positions, Tong is badly burned pushing Lei out of the way of an exploding truck. Lying together injured, Lei asks Tong why he came back. Tong confesses that he lied about having a wife and kids and felt guilty about how much Lei trusted him. Lei entrusts Tong with his diary of writings addressed to his wife Zhou and orders Tong to make sure she receives the diary. Lei then returns to his command post to look upon his wedding photo and dream of his wife and children at a country estate. He is presumably killed when a tank shell hits the post. Part II: During the Chinese Revolution in 1949, three couples flee from China to the island of Taiwan.

Retrieved 5 August 2013. History The medieval church was originally dedicated to St Lawrence but after it was rebuilt in 1595 it was dedicated to the Holy Trinity. After the Reformation it was owned by the Crown until it was transferred to the prefect Henning Ulrich von L√ºtzow in 1689 who gained ownership of nearby S√∏holt the following year. It later came into the ownership of Raben Huitfeld Levetzau til K√¶rstrup (1835) and then Baron Gottlob Rosenkrantz until it gained independence in 1916. Architecture The old Romanesque church fell into such a bad state of repair that it was almost completely rebuilt by Henning G√∏ye til K√¶rstrup og S√∏holt in 1595. Now in the Renaissance style, the church consists of a chancel, nave and tower, with burial chapels to the north and south. Unusually, the north chapel is three- sided. More recently, a small porch was built on the west side of the tower. The chancel, nave and chapels are built of roughly-hued fieldstone with some brick while the tower is in red brick. Interior The Renaissance triptych altarpiece (1610), partly reconstructed from an earlier five-winged Late- Gothic work, contains a copy of Jacob Jordaens' Adoration of the Shepherds from 1618. The pulpit () bears copies of Bertel Thorvaldsen's carved figures of Peter, Paul and John which were added later.

He is also remembered for calculating the pseudoprimes to base two, first up to 50 million in 1926, then up to 100 million in 1938. These are now often called Poulet numbers in his honour (they are also known as Fermatians or Sarrus numbers). In 1925, he published forty- three new multiperfect numbers, including the first two known octo-perfect numbers. His achievements are particularly remarkable given that he worked without the aid of modern computers and calculators. Career Poulet published at least two books about his mathematical work, Parfaits, amiables et extensions (1918) (Perfect and Amicable Numbers and Their Extensions) and La chasse aux nombres (1929) (The Hunt for Numbers). He wrote the latter in the French village of Lambres-lez-Aire in the Pas-de-Calais, a short distance across the border with Belgium. Both were published by √©ditions Stevens of Brussels. Sociable chains In a sociable chain, or aliquot cycle, a sequence of divisor-sums returns to the initial number. These are the two chains Poulet described in 1918: 12496 ‚Üí 14288 ‚Üí 15472 ‚Üí 14536 ‚Üí 14264 ‚Üí 12496 (5 links) 14316 ‚Üí 19116 ‚Üí 31704 ‚Üí 47616 ‚Üí 83328 ‚Üí 177792 ‚Üí 295488 ‚Üí 629072 ‚Üí 589786 ‚Üí 294896 ‚Üí 358336 ‚Üí 418904 ‚Üí 366556 ‚Üí 274924 ‚Üí 275444 ‚Üí 243760 ‚Üí 376736 ‚Üí 381028 ‚Üí 285778 ‚Üí 152990 ‚Üí 122410 ‚Üí 97946 ‚Üí 48976 ‚Üí 45946 ‚Üí 22976 ‚Üí 22744 ‚Üí 19916 ‚Üí 17716 ‚Üí 14316 (28 links) The second chain remains by far the longest known, despite the exhaustive computer searches begun by the French mathematician Henri Cohen in 1969. Poulet introduced sociable chains in a paper in the journal L'Interm√©diaire des Math√©maticiens #25 (1918). The paper ran like this: :If one considers a whole number a, the sum b of its proper divisors, the sum c of the proper divisors of b, the sum d of the proper divisors of c, and so on, one creates a sequence that, continued indefinitely, can develop in three ways: :The most frequent is to arrive at a prime number, then at unity [i.e., 1]. The sequence ends here. :One arrives at a previously calculated number. The sequence is indefinite and periodic. If the period is one, the number is perfect. If the period is two, the numbers are amicable. But the period can be longer than two, involving what I will call, to keep the same terminology, sociable numbers. For example, the number 12496 creates a period of four terms, the number 14316 a period of 28 terms. :Finally, in some cases a sequence creates very large numbers that become impossible to resolve into divisors. For example, the number 138. :This being so, I ask: :If this third case really exists or if, calculating long enough, one would not necessarily end in one of the two other cases, as I am driven to believe. :If sociable chains other than those above can be found, especially chains of three terms. (It will be pointless, I think, to try numbers below 12000, because I have tested all of them.) The French original runs like this: :Si l'on consid√®re un nombre entier a, la somme b de ses parties aliquotes, la somme c des parties aliquotes de b, la somme d des parties aliquotes de c et ainsi de suite, on obtient un d√©veloppement qui, pouss√© ind√©finiment, peut se pr√©senter sous trois aspects diff√©rents: :Le plus souvent on finit par tomber sur un nombre premier, puis sur l'unit√©. Le d√©veloppement est fini. :On retrouve √† un moment donn√© un nombre d√©j√† recontr√©. Le d√©veloppement est ind√©fini et p√©riodique. Si la p√©riode n'a qu'un terme, ce terme est un nombre parfait. Si la p√©riode a deux termes, ces termes sont des nombres amiables. La p√©riode peut avoir plus de deux termes, qu'on pourrait appeler, pour garder la m√©me terminologie, des nombres sociables. :Par exemple le nombre 12496 engendre une p√©riode de 4 termes, le nombre 14316 une p√©riode de 28 termes. :Enfin dans certains cas, on arrive √† des nombres tr√®s grands qui rendent la calcul insupportable. Exemple: le nombre 138. :Cela √©tant, je demande: :Si ce troisi√®me cas existe r√©ellement ou si, en poursuivant ind√©finiment le calcul, il ne se r√©soudrait pas n√©cessairement dans l'un ou l'autre des deux premiers, comme je suis port√© √† le croire. :Si l'on connait d'autres groupes sociables que ceux donn√©s plus haut, notament des groupes de trois termes. (Il est inutile, je pense, d'essayer les nombres inf√©rieurs √† 12000 que j'ai tous examin√©s.) References External links * Poulet biography at Numericana's Biographies by G√©rard P.

Design and development The W.3 was designed from the outset as a torpedo bomber, a large two bay biplane powered by two Benz Bz.III engines in pusher configuration mounted on top of the lower wing; these drove two blade propellers, The wings had straight leading edges, squared tips and almost constant chord, though the upper trailing edge was complicated by cut- outs for the propellers and by ailerons, fitted only to this wing, which increased in chord outwards. There was no stagger, so each pair of interplane struts was perpendicular to the wing; the forward member of each pair was at the leading edge and the other at mid-chord. The fuselage was flat sided, with two open, tandem cockpits in the nose ahead of the leading edge and deepest between nose and trailing edge, forming a belly which housed the torpedo. Aft, it became quite slender, with a broad chord, triangular fin and rounded, balanced rudder. Twin floats, only about half as long as the fuselage, were mounted on individual sets of struts to allow torpedo release between them.

At that time, all the islets of the Kinmen Archipelago were considered as war zones under Martial Law, which was to allow the Republic of China (Taiwan) to prevent an attack by the People's Liberation Army of the Communist Party of China. The commanding Major-general of the Dadan Defense Team (), Premier Deputy Division Commander of the 158 Lieyu Division (), received the couple and escorted them to the superior Kinmen Defense Command () on the Field army level, but was immediately relieved of his post by the Commander General Song Hsin-lian () for violating the directive to \\"Accept no surrender in the war zone\\". As a result, the commander of the neighboring Erdan Island (), Deputy Brigade Commander of the 473 Brigade, lieutenant-colonel Zhong, summoned all the soldiers to reiterate the order that \\"Whoever lands on the island must be executed without exception\\". Soon after this statement, he was exceptionally promoted to the position of 472 Nantang Brigade Commander (), taking charge of all the units in the South Lieyu Defense Team (), whereas General Song was promoted as the Director of National Security Bureau back to Taipei in December, 1985. At noon on 28 February 1987, one week before the Lieyu massacre, a local Chinese fishing boat crossed Xiamen Bay. It was intensely fired upon until it caught fire near Dadan Island. The fishermen on board waved a white cloth in an attempt to communicate their surrender. However, the boat was sunk by tank gun shots ordered by the new Dadan commander, Major-general Chien Yi-hu () after receiving the approval of the Kinmen Defense Commander, General Zhao Wan-fu () . There was only one survivor, who swam to cling onto a rock nearby, but who was eventually lost to the tidal waves. Massacre In the morning of 7 March 1987, a boat carrying Vietnamese refugees who had been rejected in Hong Kong earlier arrived in Kinmen requesting political asylum. Kinmen Defense Commander, General Zhao rejected the request, and ordered a patrol boat of the Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion (ARB-101, ) to tow away the boat from the shore with a warning not to return. However, for reasons unclear, the information about the boat's presence in the Southern sea was never forwarded to the front line of the coastal defense units, including those in the Lieyu island. As a seasonal heavy fog appeared on the coast and gradually turned clear in the afternoon, the Vietnamese boat was sighted off the south shore at 16:37. The local 1st Dashanding Infantry Battalion () Commander Major Liu, the 472 Brigade Commander Colonel Zhong and the 158 Division G3 Chief Operation Officer () Colonel arrived at the scene with staff officers. Warning shots, followed by expelling shots, then destroying shots as per the procedure steps of Army Rule of Engagement were fired by the ROC military, but the Vietnamese boat was stranded on the sand beach south-west of Donggang (\\"East Cape\\", ) fishery port (Fort 05), a sensitive strategic point in front of a mobile M30 mortar position with the communication center nicknamed \\"04\\" on hill with a 30-degree angle of blind corner on radar screen by the steep landform in front of the classified 240 mm howitzer M1 (aka. \\"Black Dragon\\" or \\"Nuclear Cannon\\") rail-gun positions of Kinmen Defense Command, and the 155/105 mm artillery battalions of 158 Division. It was hit by crossfire and two M72 LAW bazooka shots by the WPN Company in reinforcement. Armor-piercing shells penetrated through the wooden hull without detonation. Three unarmed Vietnamese men jumped off the boat, raised their hands, and pled in Chinese, \\"Don't shoot...!\\" but were all shot dead instantly. The local 3rd Dongang Company () Commander, Captain Zhang, received the order from the brigade commander to dispatch a search team boarding the boat. Two hand grenades were thrown into the boat, then found that all the passengers were Vietnamese refugees with no weapon on board. The passengers said the vessel had experienced a mechanical failure. Because of the heavy fog, the strong seasonal currents and the rising tide since late afternoon, the boat drifted into the open bay. The surviving passengers and the bodies of the dead were taken out of the boat and placed on the beach with neither first aid nor any life support supply rendered. Followed by intense telecommunication with the Division Headquarter (DHQ), the commanders at the scene received orders from their superiors - alleged directly by Commander General Zhao - to execute the passengers to eliminate all the eyewitnesses. Some received multiple shots when one bullet did not kill. Among the bodies piled were elderly, women, one pregnant, children, and a baby in a sweater. In the morning 09:00 of 8 March 1987, the Medical Platoon of the Battalion Headquarter (BHQ) Company was called in to bury all the bodies at the beach. The platoon members were ordered to execute any surviving refugees. The wounded were buried alive, and those who were still moving or crying were dictated to be killed by military shovels. The entire boat was also instructed to be burned down aside from the only 3-blade propeller non- flammable to gasoline, then all buried in sand to destroy all the evidence right away. The last victim, a little boy being hidden underneath a board cell was also found and executed by order without exception. The guarding sergeant of the BHQ company counted the bodies as more than nineteen. Since some medics defied the direct order of victim execution, brigade commander Zhong instructed the Nantang Brigade Headquarter (RHQ) Company commander captain leading 1/3 soldiers to take over the Battalion headquarter and the BHQ company as the emergency measure to maintain order. Later that day, a real fishing boat from China approached the coast attempting to check out what happened. It was also shot to destroy, and sunk in the open sea with 4 confirmed kills to assure all lips sealed - which some veterans later called the \\"March 8 Incident\\".Ah-hsin, 158D veteran, \\"20th Memorial to the Donggang Incident\\", (Èòø‰ø° „ÄäÊù±Â¥ó‰∫ã‰ª∂‰∫åÂçÅÈÄ±Âπ¥„ÄãÔºåÈõ£ÂæóÁ∑£‰ªΩÔΩûÈáëË™†ÈÄ£ÈÉ®ËêΩÊ†º), Mar. 7, 2007 Ten weeks later, the President of the Republic of China (Taiwan), Chiang Ching-kuo, reacted to concealment of the massacre by the 158 Division and the Kinmen Defense Command. General Zhao Wan-fu, said he was unaware of the event. While being questioned by the Chief of the General Staff (), Superior-general Hau Pei-tsun on 20 May, General Zhao still lied: \\"It was just a couple of 'Communist soldiers' (referring to the penetration of People's Liberation Army) being shot in the water\\", but Zhao's statement was obviously unbelievable. Then Superior-general Hau ordered the exhumation of the corpses from the first scene, moved them toward a higher hidden slope in front of Fort 03 to the right, filled with cement and later even built a concrete training wall above it to prevent any future investigation. The corpses remain sealed in the final place with no tomb today. Revelation The native store owner heard the crying of refugees overnight and made a phone call to inform the National Assembly member, Huang Chao-hui in Kaohsiung, but the contact was soon lost whereas all civilian and public long-distance phone calls being also routinely monitored by the Communication Supervision Section of Kinmen Defense Command. Nevertheless, the bodies were not buried deeply on the first scene. Influenced by tidal seawater and high temperatures, the bodies soon began to decompose and were dug out by wild dogs from the landfill () on the back side of the western hill. Accounts of ghost sightings prompted villagers to hold religious ceremonies, making it all the more difficult to block the news. In early May 1987, British Hong Kong newspapers first reported the massacre. Informed by the overseas office, higher officials questioned the Kinmen Defense Command but got no concrete response; instead, the Command swapped this coast defense battalion from the front line with another reserve battalion in the training base in urgency in order to strengthen the personnel control and communication restriction to prevent further leaking news, and their unit designation codes were also shifted for the following 2 years to confuse outsiders. Twice of \\"extra bonus\\" cash summing up to half a month of a captain's salary, $6,000 were also abnormally awarded to the company commanders against the government regulation and ethics on the eve of Dragon boat festival. Until the end of May, recently discharged conscript soldiers from Kinmen began to arrive in Taiwan Proper by the term schedule and finally able to appeal to the newly founded opposition party, Democratic Progressive Party. The information of the massacre started to spread in Taiwan. As a key witness at the DHQ Situation Room () when the massacre occurred for the investigation by the end of May, the Chief Intelligence Officer of 158 Division G2 (ÂèÉ‰∫åÁßëÁßëÈï∑), Lieutenant-colonel Xu Lai (), mysteriously disappeared after a supervision task over a company- level night patrol and checkpoints, same to another non-commissioned officer at post within a week. Their bodies were never found.Xu Tim, \\"My father in the Kinmen massacre\\" (ÂæêÈúÜ„ÄäÁà∂Ë¶™(‰∏ä) ÈáëÈñÄÂ±†ÊÆ∫‰∫ã‰ª∂„Äã), Jun. 4, 2008 On 5 June 1987, Independence Evening Post was the first Taiwanese newspaper reporting the massacre with the formal questioning by the newly elected Parliament Member and future First Lady Wu Shu-chen from the Democratic Progressive Party to the Ministry of National Defense during the general assembly of Legislative Yuan. Her questions were repeatedly denied by the Military Spokesman, Major-general Zhang Hui Yuan (), who accused the Congresswoman, Mme. Wu of \\"sabotaging the national reputation\\", and claimed it was actually \\"a Chinese fishing boat being sunk in the sea after ignoring the warnings\\". Aug. 1989 The uniformed propaganda was broadcast in the evening news on all public TV channels that night, and since next morning on 6 June, all local newspapers received the government instructions to publicize the press release of the Central News Agency originated from the Military News Agency (). The case was classified as military secret ever since for 20 years to prevent any further leaking information or the prosecution will apply.Yung-yuan, \\"Related reportage entries on March 7 Incident\\"„Ää‰∏â‰∏É‰∫ã‰ª∂Áõ∏ÈóúÂ†±Â∞é„Äãclipping data, Bahamut, Nov. 15, 2015 The following media reports were censored and the publication were banned by the Nationalist government. Eventually when the police broke into the Freedom Era Weekly (, which had publicized the case interviews and editorials before) magazine office for arrest with another count of Treason charge in April, 1989, Editor-in-chief, Cheng Nan-jung set himself on fire then died in blaze to protest for the freedom of speech. Military Journalist Zhang You-hua () of Independence Evening Post on the other hand was sentenced to 1 year and 7 months with a probation period of 3 years in November 1991. The official cover-up story of the Chinese fishing boat sunk by one shell of bombardment applied to the public for 13 years, until being uncovered by the publication of ¬´Diary of the Chief of the General Staff (1981-1989)¬ª () by Superior- general Hau in 2000.Bocun Hao, \\"Ba nian can mou zong zhang ri ji (She hui ren wen)\\", 2000 The Government of the Republic of China has made no comment thereafter. Aftermath After the scandal was exposed, President Chiang Ching-kuo received a letter from Amnesty International expressing humanitarian concern, and assigned the Chief of General Staff, Superior-general Hau, to investigate this case. The Minister of National Defense, Cheng Wei-yuan also arrived in Kinmen, who dispatched a special envoy of the Political Warfare Bureau to conduct the field investigation with excavation discovering the civilian cadavres and eventually solved the criminal case on 23 May. On 28 May, the Military Police detained over 30 officers back to Taiwan to court- martial, including the commanders, corresponding political officers and related staff officers along the 5 levels on the chain of command, whereas 45 officers received the administrative sanction of dishonored transfer.Wen-xiao Liu, Editor-in-chief of ¬´WPN Tactics¬ª and ¬´Wings of China¬ª,\\"Kinmen Defense Commander talks on the Donggang Incident\\", Wings of China film database, Nov. 3, 2019 Later on 14 July, Minister Cheng also endorsed the historical decree of President Chiang to end the notorious 38-year-long Martial law ruling period (1948-1987) in Taiwan, except the War Zone Administration (() on the frontier regions including Kinmen and Matsu Islands remained under the military governing till 7 November 1992.Art. 3, (ÈáëÈñÄÈ¶¨Á•ñÊù±Ê≤ôÂçóÊ≤ôÂú∞ÂçÄÂÆâÂÖ®ÂèäËºîÂ∞éÊ¢ù‰æã), version in effect from 7 November 1992, to 12 May 1994. President Chiang further lifted the ban on the divided family members cross the Strait visiting China by transfer through a third place, such as Hong Kong or Tokyo, on 2, November. In October 1987, Brigade Commander Zhong was sentenced to 1 year and 10 months for abetting murders; Battalion Commander Major Liu was sentenced to 1 year and 10 months for being an accomplice to serial murders; WPN and 3rd Company commanders, Captain Li and Captain Zhang, both were sentenced to 1 year and 8 months for serial murders - but all the sentences were commuted with a probation period of 3 years, therefore none of the convicted field commanders was required to spend one day in the prison though under heavy pressure from the international society and media later, they stayed in rank with posts suspended to continue service without pay until the end of term before relocating to training officer positions; Brigade Commander Zhong took a senior lead colonel position in a military academy, Army Communication, Electronics and Information School. Their later regular retirement and pension plans were not affected. The superior officers received no official punishment, and recovered their military career after President Chiang suddenly died in January, 1988.

Landlords, mines, agricultural and forest estates established their own branch lines which, as they united into regional networks, increasingly played a role in regional passenger traffic. Following the Treaty of Trianon some railways were cut by the new border, many remained on the territory of Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. Due to a lack of intact roads, following World War II in many places narrow-gauge railway was the only reasonable way to get around. In 1968 the Communist government started to implement a policy to dismantle the narrow-gauge network in favour of road traffic.

Early life He was eldest son of Sir Walter Ogilvy of Banff and Dunlugas, by Helen, daughter of Walter Urquhart of Cromarty. He had charters to himself and Margaret Irving, his wife, of the barony of Dunlugas, 9 March 1611, and another of the barony of Inschedour, 14 February 1628. On 30 July 1627 he was created a baronet of Nova Scotia. The family seat was Inchdrewer Castle. On Michaelmas 1628, Ogilvy killed his cousin, James Ogilvy, but on making assythment he was not further proceeded against. In January 1630 he assisted Gordon of Rothiemay against James Crichton of Frendraught, when Gordon was slain, and after Crichton was forced, through the attacks of the Gordons, to go south to Edinburgh, Ogilvy in 1634 had his two sons quietly sent to him. Opponent of the Covenanters Ogilvy supported Charles I in his contests with the Covenanters. In February 1639 he gave information to the Marquis of Huntly of a proposed rendezvous of the covenanters at Turriff; Huntly contented himself with displaying his forces. When Huntly came to terms with Montrose, Ogilvy remained a royalist, and he also prevailed on the Viscount Aboyne not to join his father in the south. Shortly afterwards, along with Aboyne, he took measures for his defence, and after Aboyne broke up his forces he still continued in arms. Learning in May 1639 of another projected rendezvous of Covenanters at Turriff, Ogilvy proposed that an attack should be made on them, and, with Sir John Gordon of Haddo, he was appointed joint general of the forces. Early in the morning of 13 May the Covenanters were surprised, and completely defeated; Spalding, i. 185), the incident becoming known locally as the Trot of Turriff. On 15 May Ogilvy and other barons entered New Aberdeen with eight hundred horse, and took possession of the town, the Covenanters retreating. On the 22nd the barons left the town, and marched towards Strathbogie, where they learned of the proposed expedition of the northern Covenanters to join Montrose at Aberdeen. Deciding to bar their way, and, crossing the River Spey under the leadership of Ogilvy, they drew up on higher ground within two miles of Elgin. There was then a parley, and both parties agreed to lay down their arms. On 30 May 1639 Ogilvy and others took ship at Macduff, Aberdeenshire, with the intention of sailing south to the king; but they meeting a ship carrying Aboyne and other royalists returning tnorth, and turned back. They landed on 6 June ‚Äî Ogilvy being then prostrated by fever ‚Äî at Aberdeen, where Aboyne proclaimed his lieutenancy in the north. Montrose having left Aberdeen for the south, the northern royalists had an opportunity of retaliation, and Ogilvy joined Aboyne and others in spoiling the Earl Marischal's lands. About September 1639 Ogilvy went south to the king, and during his absence his palace at Banff and his country house at Inschedour were looted by the Covenanters under General Robert Monro. As part reparation, Charles I in 1641 presented to him six thousand merks Scots in gold. He was also by patent, dated at Nottingham 31 August 1642, created a peer of Scotland as Lord Banff. Later life Banff was one of those who in 1644 accused James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton of treason. He died on 11 August 1663. Family By his first wife, Margaret, daughter of Alexander Irvine of Drum, Aberdeenshire, Ogilvy had a daughter Helen, married to James Ogilvy, 2nd Earl of Airlie; and by his second wife, Janet Sutherland of Duffus, Elgin, he had a son George, the second Lord Banff, and two daughters.

The park was originally laid out with traditional ornamental flowerbeds and included a circular pathway and a cafe.  Park restoration and activities  The park was maintained by the local authority, but became neglected during the 1970s and '80s, with original flowerbeds and the circular path being removed to save on maintenance costs. Following public debate about the future of the park, Friends of Coronation Gardens was formed. Renovation took place in 2006-07 and the three-phase programme included a new entrance ramp and archway, relaying of the central path, new seating and maritime planting. A new wind vane sculpture of three wild geese was also installed, representing bird migration found on the surrounding Dee Estuary. Coronation Gardens hosts a number of events during the year, including a summer Art in the Park exhibition and the Friends of Coronation Gardens Fair.

Between 1945 and 1963 it was officially named the Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija, and enjoyed a level of self-government lower than the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. In 1963, it was granted the same level of autonomy as Vojvodina, and accordingly to that official name was changed to Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija. In 1968, the term \\"Metohija\\" was dropped, and the prefix \\"Socialist\\" was added, changing the official name of the province to Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo. In 1974, both autonomous provinces (Vojvodina and Kosovo) were granted significantly increased level of autonomy. In 1989, that level of autonomy was reduced. In 1990, the term \\"Metohija\\" was reinserted into provincial name, and the term \\"Socialist\\" was dropped. From that point, official name of the province was again: Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija, as previously between 1963 and 1968. Background Until 1912, the region of Kosovo was under Ottoman rule. After the First Balkan War it was incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbia by the Treaty of London. At the time that Serbia annexed Kosovo (1912‚Äì1913), Noel Malcolm claims the 1903 constitution was still in force. This constitution required a Grand National Assembly before Serbia's borders could be expanded to include Kosovo; but no such Grand National Assembly was ever held.Periƒá, La question constitutionelle en Serbie, Paris 1914 Constitutionally, Kosovo should not have become part of the Kingdom of Serbia. It was initially ruled by decree. Serbian political parties, and the army, could not agree on how to govern the newly conquered territories; eventually this was solved by a royal decree.Olga Popoviƒá- Obradoviƒá, The Parliamentary System in Serbia 1903‚Äì1914. In 1918, the region of Kosovo, with rest of Serbia, became part of newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (since 1929 renamed as Kingdom of Yugoslavia). During the interwar period (1918-1941), the constitutional status of the region Kosovo within Yugoslavia was unresolved. In 1941, Kingdom of Yugoslavia was attacked and occupied by Nazi Germany and its allies. The region of Kosovo was occupied by Germans (northern part), Italians (central part) and Bulgarians (eastern part). Italian occupation zone was formally annexed to Fascist Albania. That marked the beginning of mass persecution of ethnic Serbs in the annexed regions of Metohija and central Kosovo. Reign of terror was enforced by Albanian fascist organization Balli Komb√´tar and by 21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg, created by Heinrich Himmler. By the time of the liberation in 1944, Serbian population of the region was decimated. In 1944, Tito had written that it \\"will obtain a broader autonomy, and the question of which federal unit they are joined to will depend on the people themselves, through their representatives\\" although in practice decision making was centralised and undemocratic. There were various proposals to join Kosovo to other areas (even to Albania) but in 1945 it was decided to join Kosovo to Serbia. However, one piece of the former Kosovo Vilayet was given to the new Yugoslav republic of Macedonia (including the former capital Skopje), whilst another part had passed to Montenegro (mainly Pljevlja, Bijelo Polje and Ro≈æaje), also a new entity. In July 1945, a \\"Resolution for the annexation of Kosovo‚ÄìMetohija to federal Serbia\\" was passed by Kosovo's \\"Regional People's Council\\". 1945‚Äì1963 From 1945 to 1963, it was the Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija ( / Autonomna Kosovsko-Metohijska Oblast), which was a lower level of autonomy than Vojvodina. The Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija was created on 3 September 1945. After the break with the Cominform in 1948, Yugoslavia tightened certain policies, including stricter collectivisation. This led to serious reductions in grain production in Kosovo; there were food shortages across Yugoslavia. In parallel with this, the Albanian government began to criticise Yugoslav rule over Kosovo; the Yugoslav government responded with crackdowns on the local population, in search of \\"traitors\\" and \\"fifth columnists\\", although the earliest underground pro-Tirana group was not founded until the early 1960s. In the mid‚Äì1950s, the Assembly of PR Serbia decided that the Leposaviƒá municipality (187 km2) be ceded to the Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija, after requests by the Kosovo leadership. It had up until then been part of the Kraljevo srez, of which the population was wholly Serb. After this, the number of Serbs drastically fell. In 1959, Leposaviƒá was incorporated into the province. 1963‚Äì1968 The Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija ( / Autonomna Pokrajina Kosovo i Metohija, ) was the name used from 1963 to 1968, when the term \\"Metohija\\" was dropped, and the prefix \\"Socialist\\" was added. Kosovo officially became an autonomous province in 1963, after the constitutional reforms, and its position was equalized with the status of Vojvodina. Tensions between ethnic Albanians and the Yugoslav and Serbian governments were significant, not only due to national tensions but also due to political ideological concerns, especially regarding relations with neighbouring Albania.Independent International Commission on Kosovo. The Kosovo report: conflict, international response, lessons learned. New York, New York, USA: Oxford University Press, 2000. Pp. 35. Harsh repressive measures were imposed on Kosovo Albanians due to suspicions that they there were sympathisers of the Stalinist policies of Albania's Enver Hoxha. In 1956, a show trial in Pri≈°tina was held in which multiple Albanian Communists of Kosovo were convicted of being infiltrators from Albania and were given long prison sentences. High- ranking Serbian communist official Aleksandar Rankoviƒá sought to secure the position of the Serbs in Kosovo and gave them dominance in Kosovo's nomenklatura.Melissa Katherine Bokovoy, Jill A. Irvine, Carol S. Lilly. State- society relations in Yugoslavia, 1945‚Äì1992. Scranton, Pennsylvania, USA: Palgrave Macmillan, 1997. Pp. 295. Islam in Kosovo at this time was repressed and both Albanians and Muslim Slavs were encouraged to declare themselves to be Turkish and emigrate to Turkey. At the same time Serbs and Montenegrins dominated the government, security forces, and industrial employment in Kosovo. Albanians resented these conditions and protested against them in the late 1960s, accusing the actions taken by authorities in Kosovo as being colonialist, as well as demanding that Kosovo be made a republic, or declaring support for Albania. 1968‚Äì1990 The Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo ( / Socijalistiƒçka Autonomna Pokrajina Kosovo, ) was the name used from 1968, when the prefix \\"Socialist\\" was added, and the term \\"Metohija\\" was dropped. The name Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo was officially used until 1990, when the term \\"Metohija\\" was reinserted into the official name, and the prefix \\"Socialist\\" was dropped. =Building substantial autonomy: 1968‚Äì1974= Autonomy of Kosovo was significantly strengthened in 1968, as a result of major political changes in Yugoslavia. After the earlier ouster of Rankoviƒá in 1966, the agenda of pro-decentralisation reformers in Yugoslavia, especially from Slovenia and Croatia succeeded in the 1968 in attaining significant constitutional decentralisation of powers, creating substantial autonomy in both Kosovo and Vojvodina, and recognising a Muslim Yugoslav nationality.Melissa Katherine Bokovoy, Jill A. Irvine, Carol S. Lilly. State- society relations in Yugoslavia, 1945‚Äì1992. Scranton, Pennsylvania, USA: Palgrave Macmillan, 1997. Pp. 296. As a result of these reforms, there was a massive overhaul of Kosovo's nomenklatura and police, that shifted from being Serb-dominated to ethnic Albanian-dominated through firing Serbs in large scale. Further concessions were made to the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo in response to unrest, including the creation of the University of Pristina as an Albanian language institution. These changes created widespread fear amongst Serbs that they were being made second-class citizens in Yugoslavia by these changes.Melissa Katherine Bokovoy, Jill A. Irvine, Carol S. Lilly. State- society relations in Yugoslavia, 1945‚Äì1992. Scranton, Pennsylvania, USA: Palgrave Macmillan, 1997. Pp. 301. =Substantial autonomy achieved: 1974‚Äì1990= The Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo received more autonomy within Serbia and Yugoslavia by constitutional reform in 1974. In the new constitutions of Yugoslavia and Serbia, adopted during the reform of 1974, Kosovo was granted major autonomy, allowing it to have not only its own administration and assembly, but also a substantial constitutional, legislative and judicial autonomy.Independent International Commission on Kosovo. The Kosovo report: conflict, international response, lessons learned. New York, New York, USA: Oxford University Press, 2000. Pp. 35‚Äì36. Per the Constitutions of SFR Yugoslavia and SR Serbia, SAP Kosovo also gained its own Constitution. The Province of Kosovo gained the highest officials, most notably Presidency and Government, and gained a seat in the Federal Presidium of Yugoslavia (including veto power on the federal level) which equated it to the states of SR Serbia. The local Albanian-dominated ruling class had been asking for recognition of Kosovo as a parallel republic to Serbia within the Federation, and after Josip Broz Tito‚Äôs death in 1980, the demands were renewed. In March 1981, Albanian students started the 1981 protests in Kosovo, where a social protest turned into violent mass riots with nationalist demands across the province, which the Yugoslav authorities contained with force. Emigration of non-Albanians increased and ethnic tensions between Albanians and non-Albanians greatly increased, with violent inner-attacks, especially aimed at the Yugoslavian officials and representatives of authority. In 1988 and 1989, Serbian authorities engaged in a series of moves known as the anti- bureaucratic revolution, which resulted in the sacking of province leadership in November 1988 and a significant reduction of autonomy of Kosovo in March 1989. On 28 June 1989, Milo≈°eviƒá led a mass celebration of the 600th anniversary of a 1389 Battle of Kosovo. Milo≈°eviƒá's Gazimestan speech, which marked the beginning of his political prominence, was an important part of the events that contributed to the ongoing crisis in Kosovo. The ensuing Serbian nationalist movement was also a contributing factor to the Yugoslav Wars. The status of Kosovo was returned to the pre-1968 Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija by the new Constitution of the Republic of Serbia, adopted on 28 September 1990. The Kosovo War followed.

He succeeded his grandfather John Oliphant, 2nd Lord Oliphant, in 1516, and was one of the Scottish nobles taken prisoner at the battle of Solway Moss on 25 November 1542, reaching Newark on 15 December, on the way to London. The annual value of his lands was then estimated at two thousand merks Scots. Oliphant remained in England in the custody of Sir Thomas Lee, knt., but on 1 July 1543 was allowed to be ransomed for eight hundred merks sterling, on condition that, along with other captive Scottish nobles, he should acknowledge Henry VIII of England as lord-superior, should co-operate in procuring him the government of Scotland, and should exert his influence to get the infant Queen Mary delivered to Henry, to be brought up in England. He later made no attempt to fulfil these pledges. In 1560 at a meeting at Aberdeen he nominally adhered to the Protestant cause, but probably never joined against Queen Mary.

Many voices pillage my poetry, or rather scuffle over it, a thing I cannot control or adopt, especially when its essence does not emanate from an articulating self, but is defined by a structure that is linked to the out-side, with others and with the world itself. It is also difficult for me to delineate a goal for my journey in writing, for I have not hesitated to submerge myself, as if in a sea, surrounded so completely by water, that I do not see an outlet or an exit except to strive and work and paddle continuously so that finding the way, eventually, is nothing but the end of the struggle and the comfort of arrival (...). Nevertheless, I can say that in writing there is the promise that the act of writing gives itself through the writer and the promise to the reader that is often indirect, postponed, and at times unfulfilled like a letter in a bottle thrown in the sea. This promise is part of our aspired humanity which is heightened, driven and amplified through the multiplicity of meaning\\". * In \\"My Computer, My Portable Metaphor\\", Dagher adds: \\"For in writing, in focusing on it, in the fact that it demands more energy of me than all my other activities, is what attracts me to it and what makes it my recreation, for its value is inherent within it; in performing it; in the fact that it spontaneously justifies itself; in that, although seemingly repetitive, it is a transformational activity for things that appear to be hidden from me but are in fact parts of me, closer to me than myself. If writing finds something outside itself that would justify that self to the reader, then this indicates to me again that our abilities transcend us with their flying arrows\\".

History  Cruquius Island was built between 1875 and 1925 originally for the expansion of the Port of Amsterdam. The 19th century saw a movement away from private slaughterhouses, and toward public slaughterhouses. To this end, the Veemarkt (Cattle market) was provisioned in Cruquiuseiland. It was designed by the architects A.C. Boerma and E. Damen, and constructed in 1887. There was a marketplace and stables for cows, calves, horses, sheep and pigs. The area also included municipal customs warehouse, and an abattoir which was expanded in 1919. Only eight buildings have been preserved, including the homes of the market manager and the weigher, the canteen building with monumental gate and a police station. The buildings are the oldest building of the Eastern Docklands Subsequently, the majority of the area has been converted into residential buildings, although there are many business premises, particularly to the east and to the southwest side.

Life The eldest son of Laurence Oliphant, 3rd Lord Oliphant, by Margaret Sandilands, in 1543 he was sent to England as a hostage for his father. After the marriage of Mary Queen of Scots to Darnley, while Master of Oliphant, he sat as an extraordinary member of the privy council in August 1565. In 1565 certain persons accused of serious crimes took over his house of Berrydale, which they garrisoned and held; but on 13 April 1566 they were ordered by the council to give it up to him within 24 hours under pain of being treated as rebels, i.e. being hang, drawn and quartered upon capture. He succeeded his father on 26 March of the same year, and was served heir on 2 May. Oliphant sat on the assize for the trial of James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell for the murder of Darnley, signed the Ainslie Tavern Bond for Bothwell's marriage to the queen, and was one of the nine temporal lords present at the marriage. At the same time as John Hamilton he was admitted a member of the privy council. He joined the association on behalf of Mary at Hamilton on 8 May 1568, and fought for her at the battle of Langside. On this account he was charged to appear before the regent and lords of the privy council, and, failing to do so, was on 2 August 1568 denounced a rebel and put to the horn; but on 5 April 1569 he signed a \\"band for the king\\", and on 16 June again appeared as a member of the privy council. Oliphant was one of sixteen persons appointed by Queen Mary, at Bolton Castle on 6 March 1569 to act as advisers, with the Duke of Ch√¢tellerault, the Earl of Huntly and Earl of Argyll, in the difficult circumstances of the Scottish kingdom. He attended the convention at Perth on 31 July of the same year, and voted against the queen's divorce from Bothwell. An attack on him and his servants on 18 July at the instance of George Sinclair, 4th Earl of Caithness was the subject of deliberation by the privy council on 12 October and 22 November. After the death of the Regent Moray in January 1570, Oliphant met the leaders of the queen's party at Linlithgow, where they had a conference with the French ambassador. Henry Killigrew, in a letter to Lord Burghley in 1573, mentioned that Oliphant had joined the anti- Marian party after James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton's succession as regent to James VI; but he had attended a meeting of the privy council at Leith in May 1572, while Regent Mar was still alive. After the retirement of Morton from the regency, Oliphant attended the meeting of the parliament in Stirling Castle on 16 July 1578, presided over by the king. In November 1580 he was charged to answer before the council for an attack on Lord Ruthven, and on 7 December caution money was set that he would on the 9th enter into ward in Doune Castle in Menteith. Subsequently disputes between him and the Earl of Caithness often came to the privy council. There is evidence that the 4th Lord Oliphant added two floors to the east tower of Kellie Castle in Fife in 1573. The south elevation bears the initials of his second wife, Margaret Hay.National Trust for Scotland (2008), Kellie Castle & Garden, pp. 4 & 14 Oliphant died at Caithness on 16 January 1593, and was buried in the church of Wick.

(As for \\"biological process related to reproduction\\", see: Capacitation).Capacitation marks the generic difference between transitiveThat is, subject-to-subject transmission of knowledge, skills and communication(s). Banking education (Freire) \\"in which the teacher issues communiques and makes deposits which the students patiently receive, memorize, and repeat\\" would be an example of such subject-to-subject transitive mode, in the field of education. and intransitiveThat is, non-transitive, object-to-subject 'objective activity', i.e. where the object teaches or how adults learn, ie autonomously ‚Äì see: Andragogy and \\"Andragogy forms the basis of the process\\". modes of learning and communicatinge.g. The \\"Concise Oxford Dictionary\\" 2004, OUP p. 110 translates capacitaci√≥n (Spanish) as training (English). ‚Äì Conversely, the Spanish translation of \\"training\\"(English) is not capacitaci√≥n (Spanish), but, instead, entrenamiento(Spanish)/ adiestriamiento(Spanish). Alternatively: entrenamento(Portuguese)/adestramento(Portuguese). implicit in de Morais' aphorism se aprende, por√©m n√£o se capacita (Portuguese) : \\"[The trainee] learns, but is not capacitated\\".Morais in: p. 6 (nb. Portuguese original): \\"Professional training [models] generally transfer elements of theory well before practical elements are produced. The latter aborts the capacitation process: the trainee learns, but is not capacitated: se aprende, por√©m n√£o se capacita (Portuguese).

See also: Pedagogy of the Oppressed de Morais' Organization Workshop (OW) ‚Äì and, hence, moraisean large- group capacitation (LGC) ‚Äì did not come to the attention of the English- speaking public until the mid-80s, when the Chilean Social Psychologists I. & I. Labra moved to Zimbabwe and transferred the method to the (southern) African context. Ch 12: \\"Hard Learning in Zimbabwe\\". Latino texts were initially translated on an 'ad hoc' basis, including the 'dictionary' translation of capacitaci√≥n (Spanish) as training (English).'Training' also happened to coincide with potential sponsors' Development glossaries, e.g. the ILO's 1980s Persons with Lower Levels of Literacy (LLLs) training modules .'Dictionary' translations of capacita√ß√£o (Portuguese)/capacitaci√≥n (Spanish) (translated as \\"training\\") occasionally can be found in official documents, as, e.g., in , which is a Government translation of Vera Nacif's original Spanish text . Cherrett's 1992 first ever translation into English of de Morais' Apuntes de Teor√≠a de la Organizaci√≥n,transl: \\"Notes on a Theory of Organization\\" (ETC, Newcastle, UK) also, was still referred to as a \\"Training\\" Manual.

(see: ) that a consensus was reached on the dedicated terms Capacitation and Large Group Capacitation (LGC). p. 10  Capacitation in community health, adult education and international development  Capacitation (outside the field of biology) has been used previously, in English, mainly to emphasize educational content which differs from and/or transcends the basic meaning of the English one-size-fits-all training.Etymology of Training quote : \\"from the 14th Century Old French trahiner ‚Äì to drag\\". (NB: which would be a clear indication of its transitive pedigree of the English term). In some sectors of Community health, \\"capacitation\\" is said to be synonymous with empowering training. Capacitation has also historically been used in the area of adult education, starting with Paulo Freire, who, in the seventies, uses the term \\"Technical Proficiency Capacitation\\" to refer to a (n adult) learning activity which can \\"never be reduced to the level of mere training\\". In the eighties, Capacitation is defined, by the ILO, as: \\"availability of opportunities for people to build up their capacities to move from the status of object and passive victims of social processes to the status of subjects guided by self-consciousness and active agents of change\\". p. 23: \\"Capacitation\\". The UNRISD (Geneva) had started (in the seventies) to promote the term capacitation as a \\"problem- solving, educational\\" alternative to the then prevalent but mainly pragmatic 'social amelioration' approaches to International development. page 39: \\"Capacitation of national societies\\". (NB: La capacitation (French) is a synonym for la prise en charge(French)/taking charge(English) ‚Äì in this case, of one's own destiny).

By the mid-nineties, any mention of capacitation had virtually disappeared from the International Development scene, to be replaced by the World-Bank-sponsored Capacity Building:\\"No summit goes by without ritual calls for capacity building programmes\\" p 168-9 quote: \\"Much of southern development practitioners' capacity enhancing practice is in the transitive vein of providing training courses for on one or another identified \\"capacity need\\".International Agencies, prominently the World Bank, as from the nineties, opted for \\"Capacity Building\\", influenced, partly, as suggests, by Amartya Sen's then up-and-coming \\"Capability approach\\" to International Development.(Capacity) \\"Building\\": \\"To build\\" means \\"to form by combining materials or parts\\".

Moraisean large-group capacitation (LGC): overview  The major theoretical influence, acknowledged by de Morais, pp. 19‚Äì23 in the development of the LGC concept and method, is the work of Aleksei N. Leontiev. re also , who sees Alexei Nikolaevich (and his son A.A.)

According to the OW approach, the Objectivized Activity concept implies the recognition that, in order to change the mind-set of individuals, we need to start with changes to their activity ‚Äì and/or to the object that \\"suggests\\" their activity. In the Organization Workshop context, the real enterprise the participants are engaged in is that \\"object that teaches\\". From a pedagogical perspective the choice of \\"object\\" is crucial. To ensure that a social scale of activity was engendered, de Morais made the requirement that a common resource pool be put at the disposal of participants, which requires that production processes be regulated (co-ordinated), independently from the whims of various collaborators. p. 6. ; . Objective(ized) Activity is at the core of what Labra has referred to as \\"another\\" tradition of Social Psychology, namely the Cultural-historical Activity Theory-based branch of Social Psychology,Cultural-historical psychology, in Andersson's words, \\"explains de Morais' method\\" re: ; which sets it apart from mainstream (behaviorist/lewinian: Lewinian Social Psychology (e.g. Group Dynamics); .

In OW-learning, the trainer's role is merely subsidiary (known as \\"scaffolding\\" in Activity Theory). and pp. 227‚Äì234: \\"Zone of proximal development (ZPD) or the gap between what an individual learner, or group of learners, has already mastered without assistance (the actual level of development), and what they potentially can achieve with the guidance of an experienced assistant or peer\\". In other words, it is not the trainer/instructor who teaches, but \\"the object that teaches\\".Sobrado in The fact that it is the \\"OW Object\\" itself that \\"teaches\\" does not preclude or exclude the provision of professional training (in the trades, enterprises, services that the participants have chosen to engage in). How 'capacitation' and 'training' go hand in hand is clear, for example, from the diary of a Resource person (i.e.trainer) at the 1994 Munguine OW in Mozambique. Moraisean capacitation, then...\\"involves several elements: mastery of a practical experience,see (): The OW is \\"a practical exercise in the creation of a real enterprise\\". perhaps with some theoretical guidance but at least with some theoretical insight;see the theoretical notions of e.g. \\"Zone of Proximal Development\\" (ZPD) and \\"Scaffolding\\" above. an element in which the object itself guides or influences the subject's understanding in the course of the activity;see: Objectivized Activity in (ppt slides). a process of critical reflection on action and on motives of action.\\"Critical Balance\\" (CB), an integral part of the OW process, also known as self-regulated learning in adult education, ensures that day-to-day tasks always keep sight of long-term objectives. re: ().

History of application  Part of the group of 850 who took part in the 1992 Matzinho 'Field' Organization Workshop (FOW), in war-torn Mozambique The insights that gave rise to what came to be known as the moraisean Large Group Capacitation Method (LGCM) were an unanticipated consequence of a 30-day course, in 1954, for a large group 50 to 60 persons, depending on sources. de Morais, then a lawyer and one of the Peasant League co-founders, attended as legal consultant. of the Northeast Region, Brazil Peasant Leagues' middle-level leadership to study Brazilian Agrarian reform law. The group met under clandestine conditions at a family home normally accommodating 7 people, in a heavily policed part of Recife (Brazil).see: Chapter 2 pp. 14‚Äì25 and p. 130 quote: \\"this led de Morais to think about other practical exercises where a shared resource base, activity and the need for analytical thought would stimulate the formation of organizational activists\\". Through the early 1960s de Morais staged workshops of an experimental character throughout the northeast of Brazil. After he was forced into exile following the 1964 coup d'√©tat, he worked as ILO Agrarian Reform Regional Advisor for Central America, and later under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), he was able to launch a multitude of 'Experimental Laboratories' (later called Organization Workshops in the Southern Africa version of the method). From 1973 he applied the emerging method to peasants' capacitation within the Agrarian reform Program of Honduras:Where he was consultant in charge of the PROCCARA Program (Campesino Capacitation Program for Agrarian Reform), which was to become the blueprint for the \\"Honduran Model\\", i.e. the application of the OW on a countrywide basis. re: and Chapter 6. over three years more than 200 workshops took place, with participation of more than 24000 peasantsOW events are open to groups of minimum 40 and up to 1,000 and more participants, local conditions permitting. Childcare (and food) provision tend to be some of the primary foci around which the group gets organized. (Other sources speak of participants becoming \\"organizationally literate\\".) and government officers from around the region. Over the years de Morais worked as consultant and/or director with the UNDP, FAO, and Catholic Relief Services. Elsewhere the OW has been sponsored by Hivos, Norwegian People's Aid, terre des hommes, Concern Worldwide, Redd Barna and, recently e.g. in South Africa, the Seriti Institute,re: Learning and Capacitation Programme Soul City Institute and government departments such as South Africa's Department of Social Development.

In the episode, Stephen Holder (Joel Kinnaman) and Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) are called to another case, which has similarities to the recently solved one. Holder suspects a cop has committed all the murders. They find clues which cause Linden to deduce that Adrian Seward was the target in 2009 and not his mother, as Adrian is followed home by a car whose driver he recognizes. Plot After a morning jog, Linden returns home to find James Skinner (Elias Koteas) sitting on her front step. He tells her that his wife asked him to leave and he thinks his marriage is over. He has lied to his family about his work to spare them the atrocities of the case. When he suggests to Linden that people like the two of them are supposed to be alone, she kisses him. Holder attends Bullet's funeral. Danette (Amy Seimetz) sits beside him. She tells him about relating to Bullet the hide-and-seek game that she played with Kallie. He tells her that Bullet tried to protect Kallie as best she could. He leaves and she sees Lyric (Julia Sarah Stone) sitting up front. Holder goes to apologize to Caroline (Jewel Staite) for their argument. They compare their levels of dating and she considers him better than her usual lawyer dates. He gets called away to the next case. At the prison, Evan Henderson (Aaron Douglas) packs up Ray Seward's belongings. He talks with Francis Becker (Hugh Dillon), who appears to be cleaning out his locker. Becker states that he has too much going on at home and has decided to retire and take his pension. He cautions him about becoming a \\"prisoner\\" to his job. Henderson thinks he will be fine. Holder arrives at a crime scene of a burned- out car with a body inside it. Linden explains the details ‚Äî unknown gender of the body with two shell casings near it. Danette eats at a fast-food restaurant where Lyric works. They bond over Bullet and Kallie, and Danette offers to style Lyric's hair for free. At the apartment, Twitch (Max Fowler) looks for a lighter and finds drugs in his coat pocket. At the station, Holder apologizes to Reddick (Gregg Henry) for the assault. Reddick has asked for a new partner and been assigned to Jablonski. He tells Holder that his wife has filed a complaint with Skinner, but he has taken care of it. \\"Cops don't rat on cops,\\" Reddick says. Holder thanks him. Skinner tells Linden that the district attorney is formally pressing charges against Joe Mills. He also mentions missing Linden as a partner and suggests she come to his lake house for the weekend. She would love to, but she and Holder have a new case. Holder interrupts to say the coroner has information for them. On the way there, Linden admits to Holder that she and Skinner have frequently been involved since they were partners. Holder supports the idea because she's \\"human.\\" On the same bridge from which Kallie peered earlier, Danette closes her eyes and counts as playing hide-and-seek, hoping her daughter will arrive. Lyric roams the streets and is approached by a man in a car who thinks she is a prostitute. Twitch sits on the roof of his apartment building and ponders the drugs, before he tosses them away. The coroner tells Holder and Linden that the female victim was shot and killed, execution style, within 24 hours. The victim was then burned beyond recognition and her teeth were removed. Identification will be difficult. Holder notices that the ring finger of the victim is missing. The coroner says it was a healed wound from possibly a few weeks ago. Linden suggests that the victim is Angie Gower. Outside in the car, she and Holder discuss the possible killer. He believes that only a cop would know the intimate details about Angie Gower and the previous case. They argue over Joe Mills's involvement. Holder doesn't think Mills is the killer and says Linden would cause another innocent man to die in prison. They go to the station to retrieve what files they can before all are packed up. Linden surveys the room, looking at her coworkers, including Reddick and Skinner. In the car, Holder asks her for the address of the first victim and goes to the Delahanty household. They speak with the Brigitte's father, Damon (Paul Jarrett), who talks about his daughter being a drug addict. Holder finds a picture of Reddick with Brigitte. Damon says he was a neighbor back then and was helping Brigitte in a junior officer's program. Outside, Holder and Linden discuss how Reddick is involved in all the murders, including Trisha Seward, when she spots a nearby tree house. She gets a map from the car and tells Holder about Ray Seward mentioning constructing a treehouse for Adrian, but not in the city limits. On the map, she finds the nearest wooded area from the Sewards is close to the pond where the 17 bodies were discovered. In the woods, they find the treehouse and the pond. She climbs to the structure and asks Holder to go to the pond. She clearly sees him and surmises the killer could clearly see Adrian at the time. Adrian was the target, not his mother. As Adrian (Rowan Longworth) walks home from school, a car follows him. Shocked, he soon recognizes the unseen driver. Reception =Critical reception= \\"From Up Here\\" was reviewed in conjunction with \\"The Road to Hamelin\\" as a two-part season finale. Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic stated, \\"In a two hours that could have easily dragged and become bloated, [the] season finale of The Killing Season 3 found a way to be compelling, exciting, focused on the characters as much as finishing the case, and providing one heck of an ending.\\" The A.V. Club's Phil Dyess-Nugent gave the finale a B+ grade, stating, \\"The pieces fit, and the revelation that Skinner, the cop who put the wrongly convicted Ray Seward away, was actually covering up his own crimes, alters the story in a way that, if anything, makes more sense, not less.\\" =Ratings= The two-part season finale was watched by 1.48 million viewers, a slight increase from the second season's finale, as well as the previous episode, and got a 0.5 rating in the 18-49 ages demographic.

About Balhashtcvetmet specialises in the extraction of ores, metal processing and the production of non-ferrous metals and their alloys. Ore is delivered from different mines. The largest one is Kounrad mine, located 12 kilometers north of the plant. The most remote mine is Sayak, located 250 km to the east. The ore includes many different elements. It contains about 60 percent copper. The ore also contains some precious metals. Balhashtsvetmet's main products are minerals, molybdenum ores, cermets, refined copper, zinc, gold, silver, magnesium, silicon, sulfuric acid, copper sulfate, alloying elements, sheet metal and many others. Balhashtsvetmet belongs to the Kazakhmys Corporation with head offices in London, Karaganda and Jezkazgan, Kazakhstan. Balhashtsvetmet includes the following departments: * AO ZOCM - a factory for non-ferrous metal processing. * Konyratsky mine * East Konyratsky mine * Sayak 1 (mine) * Sayak 4 (mine) * Foundries * Rolling factories Balhashcvetmet also finances a swimming pool and the Parachute Air Club. History In 1928, the English capitalist Leslie Urquhart wrote to the Soviet Glavkontsesskom to ask if they would give him the opportunity to mine in the Kirghiz steppes, near Lake Balkhash and beyond. Ten years later, after two Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union, the Bolshevik government discovered copper on the Kounrad hills, near Lake Balkhash. In the same year, on the northern shore of Lake Balkhash, a geological survey from Leningrad arrived which was led by engineer and geologist Michael Rusakov. This group conducted the first exploration of copper deposits and got encouraging results. Eventually, the expedition concluded that the area had abundant deposits of ore, and established a copper smelting factory. Rusakov telegraphed the Committee of Geology in Leningrad that a rich copper porphyry deposit had been discovered in Kounrad, near Lake Balkhash. Soon after that, the development of Kounrad area started. In October 1931, a management organization was created, with as its main task the construction of a copper smelting plant. The coast of Bertis Bay was approved as the location of the plants and affiliated cities. The chief of building was Vasily Ivanovich Ivanov, who was later arrested in 1938 and executed as an enemy of the people. In 1932, the sum of 100 million rubles was dedicated to the construction of the copper giant, amounting to one-third of the total capital investments allocated for development of the heavy industry of the republic. In March 1938, testing of the equipment of the concentrating factory began, and it produced the first concentrate. In July, the first reverberatory furnace went into service ‚Äî the foundation of metallurgical manufacturing. On 24 November 1938, Balkhash's first copper was shipped out. A plaque was placed at an entrance of the smelting plant commemorating this event, and 24 November is considered the birthday of the smelting plant. The ingot of Balkhash's first copper is kept in the Museum of the Revolution in Moscow. The lives of the inhabitants of Balkhash were affected by the attack of Nazi Germany on the Soviet Union, and the workers were ordered to send more metal to the front. Many smelter workers and miners were sent away to the front, and their places in the industrial works and mines were filled with mothers, wives, and sisters. Before the war, more than 600 women worked in the factory, but by the first year of the war this number rose to 2453. In 1966, Balhashtsvetmet was awarded the Order of Lenin. 7,500,000 Ecology Balkhashtsvetmet is the strongest environmental pollutant in the region of the Lake Balkhash. The release of wastewater from the combine into the lake leads to numerous diseases of the fauna. Industrial untreated waste water was discharged into the aquatic environment of the lake since the launch of the combine in 1938 through 1995. As a result, according to the fisheries, the contamination of components of water and air sector with heavy metals has become dominant in the present day. The content of zinc increased by 11 times, chromium by 13 times and nickel twice in the tissues of fish taken from the lake over the past 10 years. The combine is located in close proximity to residential neighborhoods in the city of Balkhash. Process gases are emitted into the atmosphere without treatment of sulfur dioxide and dust containing heavy metals, such as copper, lead, and arsenic. According to numerous testimonies of inhabitants of the city, the copper smelting department of the combine emitted a large amount of gas into the atmosphere in the summer of 2004, leading to mass deaths of birds in the area. In addition to that, many anglers caught sick fish. The local authorities ignored the offense of the release of gas. However, several reports appeared in the newspapers resulting in nothing. Allergies and asthma were common diseases among residents of the city for many years. There is very little data for the current ecological status of the Lake Balkhash and surrounding area at the moment because the previously conducted routine observations have significantly reduced and almost completely stopped research in the 1990s. The Balkhash-Alakolsky Basin Council (BABC) was established by the Act 43 of the Water Safety Code (of Kazakhstan) on July 9, 2003. In 2010, the company was fined ‚Ç∏7.5 million tenge (~US$30,000) for environmental violations.

It is widely distributed and may be found growing among other moss species.  Description  Polytrichum alpinum grows to form a loose, muddy green or bluish-green to brownish lawn. Typically, it grows up to high. The upright to erect stems often carry tufted branches of equal length above. In the lower part of the stems, leaves are small and scale-like, but become larger in the upper stem section ‚Äì usually 7‚Äì10 mm long. The broad-oval, yellowish to brownish sheath at the leaf base is linear-lanceolate and occupies less than a third of the total leaf length. Leaf edges are serrated, fitting together when dry and bending back and protruding when wet. The leaf rib is cut in the upper part, emerging from the back as a short spike from the blade tip. The spreading part of the leaf is covered with numerous lamellae (up to 40), these are in the middle of the leaf, 5-9 cells high. At the end cell, the lamella cross section is larger, ovoid and papillose. In the upper leaf, cells are square to rectangular, while lower down they become more elongated and have a hyaline (glassy) appearance. The moss is dioecious and bears fruit fairly often, with spores maturing in summer. Spores are 14 to 20 ¬µm in size and have fine hairs. The spore capsule is up to long, red below and yellowish above. The olive- brown to black seta (stalk) is slightly curved and tilted and has an elliptical-cylindrical shape. It has a clearly contrasting neck with numerous large, single-celled stomata.  Ecology and distribution  The moss grows in a variety of habitats, from shaded to sunny sites, and on fresh to moist, nutrient-poor, calcareous and base-poor soils. The moss may also colonise stony soil, boulders and snowy grikes above the treeline. In Europe, it is often found in arctic and boreal regions, while further south it is restricted to montane landscapes and alpine areas. It is also found in Asia, Africa, the Americas, Australia, New Zealand and Antarctica.  Possible species confusion  In some localities, Polytrichum alpinum may be confused with Pogonatum urnigerum. Key distinguishing features are that the spore capsules of the Alpine moss are at the bottom of large single-celled stomata; the capsule outer wall has smooth cells; the leaf sheath is much longer than that of Pogonatum urnigerum and the leaf blade is narrower and more spiky.

More than 180 died as a result of the floods. Background Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan are frequently hit by flooding during the monsoon season. Since 2010, the region has suffered devastating floods that have left hundreds dead each year. The worst flooding in the past 80 years occurred in 2010, when flooding in Pakistan resulted in more than 1,700 deaths and widespread damage. Floods Beginning 31 July 2013, Pakistan and parts of eastern Afghanistan experienced unusually heavy rainfall that caused widespread flash flooding. Flood waters began to recede on 5 August, but more heavy rain was expected later in August and September, the heart of monsoon season. All but one area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan was flood-free by 5 August, as the waters receded almost as quickly as they had risen.  Damage and casualties  =Pakistan= In Pakistan 80 deaths were reported as of 5 August; more than 30 other people were injured. The death toll rose to 83 as of 13 August with more than 94 injured. Casualties spanned the country, with the city of Karachi in south Pakistan being the hardest hit. In the northwest, 12 deaths were reported in the tribal region, eight in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and three in the Kashmir region. Fast moving water washed away many houses in the region. In central Pakistan, 12 deaths were reported in Punjab province. In the south, eight deaths were reported in Sindh and ten in Baluchistan. Across Pakistan, more than 66,000 people were affected by the rain and resulting floods. Many of the deaths were the result of collapsed houses or by electrocution from downed power lines. In Karachi, poor neighbourhoods experienced waist-deep flooding and widespread power outages. Drainage and sewage systems in the city were clogged, causing the streets to fill with water. =Afghanistan= Mountainous regions in eastern and southeastern Afghanistan were the main areas hit by floods. In the rural Surobi District 61 people were killed, and around 500 mudbrick homes were washed away across more than a dozen villages. In the provinces of Khost and Nangarhar, flooding destroyed 50 houses and thousands of acres of farm land. 24 deaths were reported in the area. In the province of Nuristan at least 60 homes were destroyed across three districts, but no casualties were reported. On 10 August, at least 22 more people killed in the flash flood near Kabul As of 14 August death toll rises above 90 in the country. Reaction and relief efforts Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's Prime Minister, sent three cabinet ministers to survey affected areas. National Disaster Management Authority chief Muhammad Saeed Aleem blamed global climate change for the floods. In eastern Pakistan, 100 trucks carrying relief supplies were dispatched, and 30 medical camps were established. Officials in Karachi said it would take at least two days to clean up after the floods receded. The army was deployed to Karachi where army engineers worked to pump out the blocked drainage systems. Officials in Afghanistan said they were unable to deliver aid to some hard hit areas due to the access roads being controlled by the Taliban insurgents. On 5 August, United Nations spokesperson Martin Nesirky said UN and its humanitarian partners are ready help Afghanistan and Pakistan if required.

The applications of system identification include any system where the inputs and outputs can be measured and include industrial processes, control systems, economic data, biology and the life sciences, medicine, social systems and many more. A nonlinear system is defined as any system that is not linear, that is any system that does not satisfy the superposition principle. This negative definition tends to obscure that there are very many different types of nonlinear systems. Historically, system identification for nonlinear systemsNelles O. \\"Nonlinear System Identification: From Classical Approaches to Neural Networks\\". Springer Verlag,2001Billings S.A. \\"Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains\\". Wiley, 2013 has developed by focusing on specific classes of system and can be broadly categorised into five basic approaches, each defined by a model class: # Volterra series models, # Block-structured models, # Neural network models, # NARMAX models, and # State-space models. There are four steps to be followed for system identification: data gathering, model postulate, parameter identification and model validation. Data gathering is considered as the first and essential part in identification terminology, used as the input for the model which is prepared later. It consists of selecting an appropriate data set, pre-processing and processing. It involves the implementation of the known algorithms together with the transcription of flight tapes, data storage and data management, calibration, processing, analysis and presentation. Moreover, model validation is necessary to gain confidence in, or reject, a particular model. In particular, the parameter estimation and the model validation are integral parts of the system identification. Validation refers to the process of confirming the conceptual model and demonstrating an adequate correspondence between the computational results of the model and the actual data.  Volterra series methods  The early work was dominated by methods based on the Volterra series, which in the discrete time case can be expressed as : \\\\begin{align} y(k)& = h_0+\\\\sum\\\\limits_{m_1=1}^M h_1(m_1)u(k-m_1) + \\\\sum\\\\limits_{m_1=1}^M \\\\sum\\\\limits_{m_2=1}^M h_2(m_1,m_2)u(k-m_1)u(k-m_2) \\\\ & {}\\\\quad{}+\\\\sum\\\\limits_{m_1=1}^M \\\\sum\\\\limits_{m_2=1}^M \\\\sum\\\\limits_{m_3=1}^M h_3(m_1,m_2,m_3)u(k-m_1)u(k-m_2)u(k-m_3) + \\\\cdots \\\\end{align} where u(k), y(k); k = 1, 2, 3, ... are the measured input and output respectively and h_\\\\ell(m_1,\\\\ldots ,m_\\\\ell) is the lth-order Volterra kernel, or lth-order nonlinear impulse response. The Volterra series is an extension of the linear convolution integral. Most of the earlier identification algorithms assumed that just the first two, linear and quadratic, Volterra kernels are present and used special inputs such as Gaussian white noise and correlation methods to identify the two Volterra kernels. In most of these methods the input has to be Gaussian and white which is a severe restriction for many real processes. These results were later extended to include the first three Volterra kernels, to allow different inputs, and other related developments including the Wiener series. A very important body of work was developed by Wiener, Lee, Bose and colleagues at MIT from the 1940s to the 1960s including the famous Lee and Schetzen method.Schetzen M. \\"The Volterra and Wiener Theories of Nonlinear Systems\\". Wiley, 1980Rugh W.J. \\"Nonlinear System Theory ‚Äì The Volterra Wiener Approach\\". Johns Hopkins University Press,1981 While these methods are still actively studied today there are several basic restrictions. These include the necessity of knowing the number of Volterra series terms a priori, the use of special inputs, and the large number of estimates that have to be identified. For example, for a system where the first order Volterra kernel is described by say 30 samples, 30x30 points will be required for the second order kernel, 30x30x30 for the third order and so on and hence the amount of data required to provide good estimates becomes excessively large.Billings S.A. \\"Identification of Nonlinear Systems: A Survey\\". IEE Proceedings Part D 127(6), 272‚Äì285,1980 These numbers can be reduced by exploiting certain symmetries but the requirements are still excessive irrespective of what algorithm is used for the identification.  Block-structured systems  Because of the problems of identifying Volterra models other model forms were investigated as a basis for system identification for nonlinear systems. Various forms of block structured nonlinear models have been introduced or re-introduced.Haber R., Keviczky L \\"Nonlinear System Identification-Input Output Modeling Approach\\". Vols I & II, Kluwer,1980 The Hammerstein model consists of a static single valued nonlinear element followed by a linear dynamic element.Hammerstein (Acta Math 1930) was not concerned with system analysis but with boundary-value problems and eigenvalues of nonlinear operators The Wiener model is the reverse of this combination so that the linear element occurs before the static nonlinear characteristic.This term is in common use but it is quite inaccurate as Wiener never used this simple model. His model was that given immediately after p.50 in Billings 1980 survey referred to in the references below. The Wiener- Hammerstein model consists of a static nonlinear element sandwiched between two dynamic linear elements, and several other model forms are available. The Hammerstein-Wiener model consists of a linear dynamic block sandwiched between two static nonlinear blocks A.Wills, T.Sch√∂n, L.Ljung, B.Ninness, Identification of Hammerstein‚ÄìWiener models, Automatica 29 (2013), 70-81.

Submitted arXiv:1802.01700.A.Polar. http://ezcodesample.com/urysohn/urysohn.html is different from other block models, it does not consists of sequence linear and nonlinear blocks, but describes both dynamic and static nonlinearities in the expression of the kernel of an operatorM.Poluektov and A.Polar. Urysohn Adaptive Filter. 2019.. All these models can be represented by a Volterra series but in this case the Volterra kernels take on a special form in each case. Identification consists of correlation based and parameter estimation methods. The correlation methods exploit certain properties of these systems, which means that if specific inputs are used, often white Gaussian noise, the individual elements can be identified one at a time. This results in manageable data requirements and the individual blocks can sometimes be related to components in the system under study. More recent results are based on parameter estimation and neural network based solutions. Many results have been introduced and these systems continue to be studied in depth. One problem is that these methods are only applicable to a very special form of model in each case and usually this model form has to be known prior to identification.  Neural networks  Artificial neural networks try loosely to imitate the network of neurons in the brain where computation takes place through a large number of simple processing elements. A typical neural network consists of a number of simple processing units interconnected to form a complex network. Layers of such units are arranged so that data is entered at the input layer and passes through either one or several intermediate layers before reaching the output layer. In supervised learning the network is trained by operating on the difference between the actual output and the desired output of the network, the prediction error, to change the connection strengths between the nodes. By iterating the weights are modified until the output error reaches an acceptable level. This process is called machine learning because the network adjusts the weights so that the output pattern is reproduced. Neural networks have been extensively studied and there are many excellent textbooks devoted to this topic in general,Haykin S. \\"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation\\". McMillan,1999 and more focused textbooks which emphasise control and systems applications,.Warwick K, Irwin G.W., Hunt K.J. \\"Neural Networks for Control and Systems\\". Peter Peregrinus, 1992 There are two main problem types that can be studied using neural networks: static problems, and dynamic problems. Static problems include pattern recognition, classification, and approximation. Dynamic problems involve lagged variables and are more appropriate for system identification and related applications. Depending on the architecture of the network the training problem can be either nonlinear- in-the-parameters which involves optimisation or linear-in-the-parameters which can be solved using classical approaches. The training algorithms can be categorised into supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning. Neural networks have excellent approximation properties but these are usually based on standard function approximation results using for example the Weierstrass Theorem that applies equally well to polynomials, rational functions, and other well-known models. Neural networks have been applied extensively to system identification problems which involve nonlinear and dynamic relationships. However, classical neural networks are purely gross static approximating machines. There is no dynamics within the network. Hence when fitting dynamic models all the dynamics arise by allocating lagged inputs and outputs to the input layer of the network. The training procedure then produces the best static approximation that relates the lagged variables assigned to the input nodes to the output. There are more complex network architectures, including recurrent networks, that produce dynamics by introducing increasing orders of lagged variables to the input nodes. But in these cases it is very easy to over specify the lags and this can lead to over fitting and poor generalisation properties. Neural networks have several advantages; they are conceptually simple, easy to train and to use, have excellent approximation properties, the concept of local and parallel processing is important and this provides integrity and fault tolerant behaviour. The biggest criticism of the classical neural network models is that the models produced are completely opaque and usually cannot be written down or analysed. It is therefore very difficult to know what is causing what, to analyse the model, or to compute dynamic characteristics from the model. Some of these points will not be relevant to all applications but they are for dynamic modelling.  NARMAX methods  The nonlinear autoregressive moving average model with exogenous inputs (NARMAX model) can represent a wide class of nonlinear systems, and is defined as : \\\\begin{align} y(k) & =F[y(k-1),y(k-2),\\\\ldots ,y(k-n_y),u(k-d),u(k-d-1),\\\\ldots ,u(k-d-n_u), \\\\ & {}\\\\quad e(k-1),e(k-2),\\\\ldots ,e(k-n_e)]+e(k) \\\\end{align} where y(k), u(k) and e(k) are the system output, input, and noise sequences respectively; n_y, n_u, and n_e are the maximum lags for the system output, input and noise; F[‚Ä¢] is some nonlinear function, d is a time delay typically set to d = 1.The model is essentially an expansion of past inputs, outputs and noise terms. Because the noise is modelled explicitly, unbiased estimates of the system model can be obtained in the presence of unobserved highly correlated and nonlinear noise. The Volterra, the block structured models and many neural network architectures can all be considered as subsets of the NARMAX model. Since NARMAX was introduced, by proving what class of nonlinear systems can be represented by this model, many results and algorithms have been derived based around this description. Most of the early work was based on polynomial expansions of the NARMAX model. These are still the most popular methods today but other more complex forms based on wavelets and other expansions have been introduced to represent severely nonlinear and highly complex nonlinear systems. A significant proportion of nonlinear systems can be represented by a NARMAX model including systems with exotic behaviours such as chaos, bifurcations, and subharmonics. While NARMAX started as the name of a model it has now developed into a philosophy of nonlinear system identification,. The NARMAX approach consists of several steps: * Structure detection: which terms are in the model * Parameter estimation: determine the model coefficients * Model validation: is the model unbiased and correct * Prediction: what is the output at some future time * Analysis: what are the dynamical properties of the system Structure detection forms the most fundamental part of NARMAX. For example, a NARMAX model which consists of one lagged input and one lagged output term, three lagged noise terms, expanded as a cubic polynomial would consist of eighty two possible candidate terms. This number of candidate terms arises because the expansion by definition includes all possible combinations within the cubic expansion. Naively proceeding to estimate a model which includes all these terms and then pruning will cause numerical and computational problems and should always be avoided. However, only a few terms are often important in the model. Structure detection, which aims to select terms one at a time, is therefore critically important. These objectives can easily be achieved by using the Orthogonal Least Squares algorithm and its derivatives to select the NARMAX model terms one at a time. These ideas can also be adapted for pattern recognition and feature selection and provide an alternative to principal component analysis but with the advantage that the features are revealed as basis functions that are easily related back to the original problem. NARMAX methods are designed to do far more than to just find the best approximating model. System identification can be divided into two aims. The first involves approximation where the key aim is to develop a model that approximates the data set such that good predictions can be made. There are many applications where this approach is appropriate, for example in time series prediction of the weather, stock prices, speech, target tracking, pattern classification etc. In such applications the form of the model is not that important. The objective is to find an approximation scheme which produces the minimum prediction errors. A second objective of system identification, which includes the first objective as a subset, involves much more than just finding a model to achieve the best mean squared errors. This second aim is why the NARMAX philosophy was developed and is linked to the idea of finding the simplest model structure. The aim here is to develop models that reproduce the dynamic characteristics of the underlying system, to find the simplest possible model, and if possible to relate this to components and behaviours of the system under study. The core aim of this second approach to identification is therefore to identify and reveal the rule that represents the system. These objectives are relevant to model simulation and control systems design, but increasingly to applications in medicine, neuro science, and the life sciences. Here the aim is to identify models, often nonlinear, that can be used to understand the basic mechanisms of how these systems operate and behave so that we can manipulate and utilise these. NARMAX methods have also been developed in the frequency and spatio-temporal domains.  Stochastic nonlinear models  In a general situation, it might be the case that some exogenous uncertain disturbance passes through the nonlinear dynamics and influence the outputs. A model class that is general enough to capture this situation is the class of stochastic nonlinear state-space models. A state-space model is usually obtained using first principle laws, such as mechanical, electrical, or thermodynamic physical laws, and the parameters to be identified usually have some physical meaning or significance. A discrete-time state-space model may be defined by the difference equations: : \\\\begin{aligned} x_{t+1} &= f(x_t, u_t, w_t; \\\\theta),\\\\ y_t &= g(x_t, u_t, v_t; \\\\theta), \\\\quad t =1,2, \\\\dots \\\\end{aligned} in which t is a positive integer referring to time. The functions f and g are general nonlinear functions. The first equation is known as the state equation and the second is known as the output equation. All the signals are modeled using stochastic processes. The process x_t is known as the state process, w_t and v_t are usually assumed independent and mutually independent such that w_t \\\\sim p(w; \\\\theta),\\\\; v_t \\\\sim p(v; \\\\theta). The parameter \\\\theta is usually a finite-dimensional (real) parameter to be estimated (using experimental data). Observe that the state process does not have to be a physical signal, and it is normally unobserved (not measured). The data set is given as a set of input-output pairs (y_t, u_t) for t = 1, \\\\dots, N for some finite positive integer value N. Unfortunately, due to the nonlinear transformation of unobserved random variables, the likelihood function of the outputs is analytically intractable; it is given in terms of a multidimensional marginalization integral. Consequently, commonly used parameter estimation methods such as the Maximum Likelihood Method or the Prediction Error Method based on the optimal one-step ahead predictor are analytically intractable. Recently, algorithms based on sequential Monte Carlo methods have been used to approximate the conditional mean of the outputs or, in conjunction with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, to approximate the maximum likelihood estimator. These methods, albeit asymptotically optimal, are computationally demanding and their use is limited to specific cases where the fundamental limitations of the employed particle filters can be avoided. An alternative solution is to apply the prediction error method using a sub-optimal predictor.M. Abdalmoaty, ‚ÄòLearning Stochastic Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Using Non-stationary Linear Predictors‚Äô, Licentiate dissertation, Stockholm, Sweden, 2017. Urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-218100 The resulting estimator can be shown to be strongly consistent and asymptotically normal and can be evaluated using relatively simple algorithms.

It was first identified in 2003. MNV is commonly used in research to model Human norovirus because the latter is difficult to grow in the laboratory. Standardized cell cultures are used in MNV propagation and the virus naturally infects mice, which allows studies in animal systems.  Virology  = Genetics = Like all noroviruses, MNV has linear, non-segmented, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kbp, encoding a large polyprotein which is cleaved into six smaller non-structural proteins (NS1/2 to NS7) by the viral 3C-like protease (NS6), a major structural protein (VP1) of about 58~60 kDa and a minor capsid protein (VP2). In addition to these proteins, MNV is unique amongst the noroviruses in possessing an additional fourth open reading frame overlapping the VP1 coding sequence. This additional reading frame encodes a virulence factor (VF1) which regulates the innate immune response. The 3'UTR of the viral genome forms stem-loop structures which have a role in virulence. = Entry = Entry mechanisms for noroviruses are still largely unknown, but the first proteinaceous receptor mediating norovirus entry was found with experiments on MNV. This receptor, CD300lf, is a membrane glycoprotein, that functions in regulation of multiple immune responses. CD300lf is found on mast cells of both murine species and humans, but definite proof of its function in human norovirus infections remains unknown. In mice however, CD300lf functions in virus binding thus having a role to play in the first steps of viral entry. Binding is essentially mediated by phospholipids of the virus' VP1 protein that bind to a cleft between CDR3 and CC‚Äôloop -domains of CD300lf -receptor.

Four of the teenagers were killed and a fifth was raped. Allen, James, and David Fryer were later convicted of the crimes and sentenced to life in prison. The attack took place on November 17, 1973. Background Report of Fryer Brothers day after captureWorthington Daily Globe, November 30, 1973 On the evening of November 17, 1973, five teenagers from Sioux Falls, South Dakota were attacked by a group of three brothers. Four of the teenagers were killed and one was raped. Those killed were Roger Essem (male, 17), Stewart Baade (male, 18), Dana Baade (male, 14), and Michael Hadrath (male, 15). Sandra Cheskey (female, 13) was raped, but survived the attack. Her testimony was instrumental in bringing the perpetrators to justice.Cedar Rapid Gazette, Nov. 19, 1973 The perpetrators of this slaying were Allen Fryer (male, 29), David Fryer (male, 24), and James Fryer (male 21) of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.Cedar Rapids Gazette, Nov. 30, 1973 The Murders The Fryer brothers were in Gitchie Manitou State Preserve looking for illumination to poach deer and happened upon the victims sitting around a campfire, singing. David Fryer was sent to spy on the group and reported back to his brothers that the teenagers had marijuana. The brothers conferred and decided to take the victims' marijuana by impersonating narcotics officers. Testimony at the trial indicated that the Fryers apparently thought narcotics agents were allowed to indiscriminately kill drug users. After getting shotguns from their truck, Allen, James, and David Fryer positioned themselves on a ridge overlooking the victims and opened fire. Roger Essem was killed immediately and Stewart Baade fell wounded. At this point, the remaining teenagers took cover in the trees. The Fryers ordered the teenagers to come out of the trees, so Michael Hadrath and Sandra Cheskey emerged together and asked the Fryers who they thought they were. Allen Fryer then shot Hadrath in the arm and said that they were police officers. Hadrath and Cheskey fell to the ground, but were forced to get up by Allen Fryer who said they were playing dead. Allen and David Fryer forced Dana Baade, Michael Hadrath, and Sandra Cheskey along a trail away from the campfire. Sandra Cheskey was tied up and placed in the victims' van. During this time, Stewart Baade was also brought back to the van from where he had been wounded. Allen Fryer then drove away in the van with Sandra Cheskey, leaving Stewart Baade, Dana Baade, and Michael Hadrath standing near the road with James and David Fryer. After Allen left, James and David Fryer killed the three teenagers with shotguns.Fryer vs Nix gives a recounting of the facts of the case The bodies were discovered the next day by a couple from Sioux Falls, SD who drove to the park while trying out their new car. Roger Essems' body wasn't discovered until the following day because it was left lying by the campfire, the site of the first encounter. Allen Fryer told Sandra Cheskey that he was a police officer while they drove around, that he was \\"The Boss\\", and that the other two would do as he instructed them. After a short time, James and David Fryer met them on the road in the pickup. Allen and Sandy got into the truck, and the group drove to a farm. At this point, James Fryer raped Sandra Cheskey. Early the next morning, Allen filled the vehicle's tank with gasoline from a large red fuel tank then drove Cheskey home, still under the pretense of being a police officer, saying that Sandra was \\"too young to get busted\\".Cedar Rapids Gazette, Feb. 20, 1974  Investigation  Because of Sandra's composure and bluntness about the rape, and all the details she remembered especially well for someone at such young age (13) some investigators questioned her credibility. She was interviewed many times and passed a polygraph test. On November 29, 1973, Sandra Cheskey was accompanied by Craig Vinson (Lyon County, Iowa, Sheriff) as they drove around the countryside looking for the farm house where Sandy was held captive and raped. Near Hartford, South Dakota, she recognized the farmhouse by the large red fuel tank that stood next to the garage. The farm was owned by Allen Fryer's employer, a local farmer. By a chance, Allen Fryer then drove by in the same blue pickup that was used the night of the murders. Sandy told Sheriff Vinson \\"That's him. That's the boss.\\" Law enforcement quickly pulled the truck over and arrested Allen Fryer. David and James Fryer were also arrested shortly thereafter. Allen Fryer claimed that Cheskey's friends were the ones shooting at him and his brothers the night of the murders and they \\"accidentally\\" killed someone. By Allen's 3rd interview he told the truth but was still trying to justify their action saying the 5 teens had been drinking and smoking marijuana, and the Fryer brothers wanted to steal it. David Fryer told a similar story, and then later changed his story to what really happened. November 30, 1973, Cheskey identified both David and James Fryer in a lineup. The interview with James Fryer was much different, as he immediately turned the blame to his brothers. He also confirmed David Fryer's story believing the teens had been smoking marijuana, that Allen Fryer was pretending to be a detective, and that Cheskey was laughing, having a good time, and willingly had sex with David and James. James also blamed his brother for killing all four of the teenage boys. James Fryer was serving time in jail during the time of the murders, but was enrolled in the Work Release Program. Instead of going back to jail, David called the jail impersonating his boss saying James needed to work an extra shift, and instead James went off with his brothers. Allen and David Fryer were moved from Sioux Falls, SD to Lyon County Jail in Rock Rapids, Iowa. James Fryer remained in Sioux Falls because he was currently serving a jail sentence. On December 1st, 1973, all three brothers were arraigned and charged with four counts of murder. Bond was set at $400,000 per man, amounting to $100,000 for each boy slain. Trial Sandra Cheskey's testimony was instrumental, as it comprised the bulk of evidence against the Fryer brothers during the 18 months of trial.Cedar Rapids Gazette, May 17, 1974 There were some issues at the trial involving confusion by Cheskey, most of which can be attributed to her age at the time (13). February 12, 1974, David Fryer pled guilty to the open charge of murder guilty to three charges of murder and one charge of manslaughter.Sioux Center News, Feb. 28, 1974 David admitted to killing Steward Baade (18). The judge sentenced David to life in prison without the possibility of parole, for which he replied \\"no\\". David said, \\"If all my appeals fail, I'll actually write the governor and ask for the death penalty. I won't live out my life in jail. Keeping me locked up for life can't turn around what happened. It can't bring those people back.\\" In 2016, David asked the Parole Board to over turn the \\"without possibility of parole\\", and it was denied after a testimony by Cheskey and Mike Hadrath's sister Lynette. Allen Fryer was subjected to psychiatric testing, and was found fit to stand trial. February 1974, Allen began his trial at the Lyon County Court House. May 20, 1974, Allen was found guilty of four counts of first degree murder and was sentenced to four consecutive life terms in prison.Sioux Center News, Aug 18, 1974 James Fryer agreed to extradition from Sioux Falls, SD to Iowa, but later fought the extradition thinking he might end back out on the streets. On June 18, 1974, after Allen Fryer's trial, he and James Fryer escaped from the Lyon County Jail, stole a vehicle, and fled the state.Sioux County Index, June 20, 1974 They were arrested in Gillette, Wyoming, and brought back to face federal charges.Sioux Center News, June 27, 1974 James trial began December 3, 1974 in Lyon County at Dickson County, Iowa where a state psychiatrist determined James had an IQ of 85 and poorly controlled his behavior. December 30, 1974 James Fryer was found guilty of three charges of first degree murder and one charge of manslaughter. Because James was going to be serving life in jail without parole the District Attorney believed there was no need to subject Cheskey to a rape trial.Sioux Center News, Jan. 15, 1975Spirit Lake Beacon, Dec. 12, 1974 All three of the Fryer brothers were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, and all appeals fell through for all Fryer brothers. They are all currently serving their sentences at the Iowa State Penitentiary in Fort Madison, Iowa. References Further reading In addition to Allen Fryer v.

He was among the first to recognize mental disease as a public health problem, a view that did not gain recognition and acceptance for many years. May was born in Lawrence, Kansas. He received his AB at the University of Kansas in 1894 and his medical degree at the University of Pennsylvania in 1899. He was a resident at the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia for one year then moved to the Brigham Hall Hospital in Canandaigua, New York, a private mental hospital where he was in charge of the pathology department and its laboratory. From 1900 to 1902, he served in the U.S. Army during the Philippine insurrection (Philippine War of Independence; Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War). Following his Army service, he began to work at the New York State Mental Hospital System in Central Islip, New York, but after a short stay, he transferred to the Binghamton State Hospital and stayed until 1911. He became superintendent of the Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in 1911, and then moved to another position as medical member of the New York State Hospital Commission. In 1916, he moved to Massachusetts to become the superintendent of the Grafton State Hospital. Soon thereafter, he transferred to the Boston State Hospital where he stayed as superintendent from 1912 to 1936. In 1913, the American Medico Psychological Association (later the American Psychiatric Association) established a committee on statistics and May was appointed to serve as a committee member. He stayed involved with the committee for nineteen years and was the committee chair for ten years. As an administrator, he was interested in mental hospital statistics and the classification of mental diseases, which were not uniform in the United States. His interest and work in these areas culminated in a publication in 1922 of the book Mental Disease: A Public Health Problem, at a time when mental disease was not viewed as a public health issue. The committee on statistics proposed a system of classification of mental disease which was adopted by the organization and became a basis for future change in keeping with advancements in psychiatric research and practice. May contributed numerous research articles to the scholarly literature. He spoke German and nearly completed a German-English dictionary of psychiatric terms. He translated a book on schizophrenia by the German psychiatrist Karl Wilmanns. He was a member of many professional and civic groups including the New England Psychiatric Society (president, 1931‚Äì1934), the American Psychiatric Association (president, 1932‚Äì1933), Board of Directors of the Massachusetts Society for Mental Hygiene, the Boston Occupational Therapy Society, the Boston City Club, the American Legion, and the Royal Medical Psychological Society of Great Britain.

Early career According to Elrington Ball, Geoffrey de Morton came from a prominent Anglo-Norman family which had settled in Dublin. He made his fortune by trading with England, Scotland and France.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p.27 Presumably his wealth was the main reason he was chosen as Mayor of Dublin, but he was plunged into controversy almost immediately after his election, when he was accused of stealing the official seal of Dublin Corporation for his own private use. Geoffrey insisted that it was not he but his wife Maud who had taken the seal, and the Corporation seem to have accepted this rather implausible explanation, although what motive his wife might have had for the theft was unclear. In 1305 he brought a series of lawsuits against Richard de Beresford, the Lord Treasurer of Ireland, and the Barons of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland), all of which failed. The Barons brought a series of counter-claims which were successful, and as a result Geoffrey was briefly imprisoned. The murage scandal Geoffrey was apparently undeterred by this setback to his career, and in 1308 he applied to King Edward II for a licence to levy a toll for six years to pay for murage, which was the tax for the upkeep of the Dublin city walls, and was also intended for the repair of Isolde's Tower, the defensive tower situated at one end of Old Dublin Bridge (now Father Mathew Bridge), which had been damaged by fire.Gilbert, John Thomas Historic and Municipal Documents of Ireland 1172-1320 Reprinted Cambridge Library Collection 2012 p. lxv Geoffrey neglected to mention that as he himself was the tenant of Isolde's tower, he was legally obliged to keep it in good repair at his own expense. The licence was granted, and led to a flood of complaints about Geoffrey's corrupt management of the tolls, and in particular his practice of exempting his own friends from paying them. In addition it appears that none of the money was actually spent on the upkeep of the walls, a failure which might have had disastrous consequences during the Bruce campaign in Ireland in 1315-18. Geoffrey also built several houses on the bridge, which it was alleged seriously disrupted the flow of traffic.Gilbert p.lxv In 1309 Richard le Blond, the King's Serjeant, made the first official complaint concerning Geoffrey's maladministration. The case was heard by Piers Gaveston, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland: the inquiry appears to have ended inconclusively. Gilbert p. lxv Disgrace By 1311 the complaints about Geoffrey's misgovernment had become so vociferous that the King ordered a full inquiry, which upheld all the complaints of fraud and neglect of official duty against him. John Wogan, the Justiciar of Ireland, was ordered to revoke the licence for murage and to audit Geoffrey's accounts.Gilbert p.lxv In 1312 the King reprimanded Wogan for failing to carry out these orders. Finally in 1313 Geoffrey admitted defeat and submitted to the grace and mercy of the Mayor and Corporation of Dublin. He promised to make amends for his trespasses, and gave a bond on behalf of himself and his family in the sum of 500 silver marks, as a pledge that he would not trouble the city any further.Gilbert p.lxv He did not however demolish the houses on Dublin Bridge: in 1317, shortly after his death, his widow, daughter and son-in-law came to an agreement with the Corporation concerning them. His son-in-law John de Grauntsete rebuilt Isolde's Tower and added another tower at the other end of the bridge, and later endowed a chapel on the bridge.

The 496-page book published by St. Martin‚Äôs Press (May 7, 2013), explains how the Spanish language evolved from a tongue spoken by a remote tribe of farmers in northern Spain to become one of the world‚Äôs most spoken languages. The Story of Spanish is described as a ‚Äúveritable biography of the Spanish language.‚Äù The book begins by explaining where the term Espa√±a (Spain) originated. Around 1200 BC when the Phoenicians landed on the Iberian Peninsula the land was riddled with furry creatures with long ears called hyraxes (rabbits). The Phoenicians named the territory the land of hyraxes: I-shepan-ha, which was later Latinized by the Romans to Hispania, to finally transform into Espa√±a centuries later. From there, Nadeau and Barlow trace the Spanish language from its evolution from Vulgar Latin all the way to its entrance to the New World (North America). The Story of Spanish breaks down major events and points out the major players in history that had a direct impact on the course of the Spanish language. For example, Nadeau and Barlow explain how the Castilian King Alfonso X improved the reputation of the language and was the first to recognize that ‚Äúvernacular languages needed rules.‚Äù And how Arabic heavily influenced Spanish during Spain‚Äôs centuries under Muslim rule. Numerous Spanish words, including words like aceite (olive oil), azul (blue) and az√∫car (sugar) come from Arabic. And how when the Spanish explored the New World they lacked the words to describe all the new things they encountered and adopted many terms from native languages such aguacate (avocado) and xitomatl that became tomate (tomato). The book ends by demonstrating just how much Spanish has spread to become the third most spoken language in the world with over five hundred million speakers and why there is an increasing number of people learning Spanish as a second language.) For example, in France there are 2.1 million people learning Spanish, mainly because the French travel to Spain a lot, and the French education system requires students to learn two foreign languages and Spanish is perceived as ‚Äúeasy.‚Äù The Story of Spanish signifies that Spanish is much more than tacos, flamenco, and bullfighting. It makes clear that how American cultural artifacts and customs are fundamentally Spanish including the dollar sign, barbecues, ranching, and cowboy culture. The authors of The Story of Spanish ends the book by describing why they believe Spanish will continue to be a dominant international language. They write, ‚ÄúThe Spanish language is unquestionably one of the great unifying forces of the Hispanic world.‚Äù  References  Category:2013 non-fiction books Category:Spanish_language ","title":"The Story of Spanish"},{"id":"40158628","text":"Euagassiceras is an extinct genus of cephalopod belonging to the Ammonite subclass.

In March 1959, a State of Emergency was declared, and Bwanausi was arrested as a leading Congress member and detained until 1960. On his release, he joined the Malawi Congress Party and in 1961 was elected to the Legislative Council, becoming Minister of Internal Affairs and Development in the same year. In 1963, he became Minister of Works. In 1964, there was a confrontation between Banda and most of his ministers, which led to the sacking of Bwanausi and two of his cabinet colleagues in September 1964. Three other cabinet ministers resigned in sympathy, and although Banda was willingness to re-instate Bwanausi and one or two other ministers, their insistence on all be reinstated ended any hope of a reconciliation. In October 1964, Bwanausi left Malawi for Zambia, where he resumed teaching, and was active in Malawian exile politics until his death in a car accident in 1973. Before Independence Augustine Bwanausi was born in Blantyre in Malawi, then called Nyasaland, in 1930, and educated at Blantyre Secondary School, where he was an outstanding student. He attended Makerere College, now Makerere University in Uganda and received a BSc degree there. He returned to Nyasaland with the intention of teaching, and in 1955 he completed a diploma in education and started to teach mathematics and science at Blantyre Secondary School. From the time of his return, he became politically active in the Nyasaland African Congress, campaigning for the end of colonial rule. Bwanausi was arrested as a leading Congress member in the State of Emergency declared in March 1959, and detained until 1960.O J M Kalinga, (2012). Historical Dictionary of Malawi, p. 70. In March 1959, when Sir Robert Armitage, the Governor declared a State of Emergency, Bwanausi was arrested as a leading Congress member and detained without trial until 1960. The Nyasaland African Congress was also banned in March 1959, but it was replaced by the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) formed in September 1959 on behalf of the imprisoned Banda. On his release, he returned to teaching, but joined the Malawi Congress Party and in 1961 was elected to the Legislative Council, becoming Minister of Internal Affairs and Development in the same year. In 1963, he became Minister of Works.A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, p. 198. The Cabinet Crisis From mid-1963, Banda began to criticise his ministers in public, and he began to create a climate of uncertainty by changing ministerial portfolios, some for alleged breaches of party discipline. Banda's failure to consult other ministers, keeping power in his own hands, maintaining diplomatic relations with South Africa and Portugal and a number of domestic austerity measures caused two confrontations in cabinet meetings, which Bwanausi attended.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965, pp. 91‚Äì2, 95-6. In the first, on 10 August 1964, all the ministers present asked Banda to stop making slighting references to them in speeches and not to hold so many government portfolios himself. In the more serious second confrontation, on 26 August 1964, the ministers present presented Banda with a list of grievances including his failure to Africanise the public service, his relations with Portugal and South Africa and their own ambiguous position.C Baker, (2001). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 72‚Äì3.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 431, 451. Banda decided not to agree to the ministers' demands, and on 1 September, he advised the Governor-General of his intention re-form the cabinet replacing a number of them by his close followers. He sacked three cabinet members including Bwanausi on 7 September 1964. Banda apparently thought that the others would remain in office, but on the same day three other cabinet ministers resigned in sympathy, precipitating the Cabinet Crisis of 1964.C Baker, (2001). Chipembere, the Missing Years, p. 77.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965 pp. 162‚Äì3. Exile and death Despite attempts by the Governor- General to mediate, and Banda's willingness to re-instate Bwanausi, his colleague, Willie Chokani and possibly one other minister, the ex-ministers' insistence on all of them being reinstated and outbreaks of violence later in September 1964 ended any hope of a reconciliation. At the start of October 1964, Bwanausi and Chokani left voluntarily for Zambia. Over the next few weeks several other ex-ministers fled the country because they feared for their safety.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 435, 437-40. Bwanausi and Chokani resumed teaching in Zambia, where they, and were active in Malawian exile politicsbecoming a prominent member of the Pan- African Democratic Party which had been formed by another ex-minister, Henry Chipembere. Bwanausi and two travelling companions were killed in a car accident near Ndola in 1973, when driving to a Pan-African Democratic Party meeting. His brother, Harry Bwanausi, a doctor, joined his brother in exile in Zambia but survived to return to Malawi in 1994.O J M Kalinga, (2012). Historical Dictionary of Malawi, p. 121.

Chokani received a secondary education, which enabled him to attend university in Delhi and obtain teaching qualifications. He returned to Nyasaland in 1957 to become the first African headmaster in the protectorate, and was also politically active in the Nyasaland African Congress, campaigning for the end of colonial rule. In March 1959, a State of emergency was declared, and Chokani was arrested as a leading Congress member and detained until 1960. On his release, he joined the Malawi Congress Party and in 1961 was elected to the Legislative Council, becoming Minister of Labour in 1962. In 1964, there was a confrontation between Banda and most of his ministers, which led to the sacking of three cabinet members in September 1964. Chokani and two other cabinet ministers resigned in sympathy, and although Banda was willingness to re-instate Chokani and one or two other ministers, their insistence on all be reinstated ended any hope of a reconciliation. Chokani left Malawi for Zambia, where he resumed teaching, and was active in Malawian exile politics. He returned to Malawi in 1993, and in 1994 became Malawi's ambassador to the USA, later holding other diplomatic posts until his retirement. . Before Independence Willie Chokani was born in 1930 in Chiradzulu District and educated at Blantyre Secondary School. He attended the University of Delhi and received BA, MA and BEd degrees there. He returned to Nyasaland in 1957, and founded and became first headmaster of the secondary school of the Henry Henderson Institute, a part of the Blantyre Mission which had previously only offered primary and vocational education. Chokani was the first African headmaster in Nyasaland, and he held this post until he was imprisoned in 1959.O J M Kalinga, (2012). Historical Dictionary of Malawi, p 121. Chokani became politically active in the Nyasaland African Congress, and campaigned actively for decolonisation. In March 1959, when Sir Robert Armitage, the Governor declared a State of emergency, Chokani was arrested as a leading Congress member and detained without trial until 1960. The Nyasaland African Congress was also banned in March 1959, but it was replaced by the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) formed in September 1959 on behalf of the imprisoned Banda. On his release, Chokani became a leading member of MCP, and in August 1961 was elected as a member of the Legislative Council for Chiradzulu.A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, p. 198.O J M Kalinga, (2012). Historical Dictionary of Malawi, p 121. Chokani was not appointed to ministerial office in August 1961 when Hastings Banda and four other MCP members were given ministerial posts, but he accompanied Banda to London in early 1962 to take part in the Marlborough House talks about future independence. When two additional ministerial posts became available in March 1962, Chokani was made Minister of Labour, a post he retained until September 1964.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 381‚Äì2. The Cabinet Crisis From mid-1963, Banda began to criticise his ministers in public, and he began to create a climate of uncertainty by changing ministerial portfolios, some for alleged breaches of party discipline. Banda's failure to consult other ministers, keeping power in his own hands, maintaining diplomatic relations with South Africa and Portugal and a number of domestic austerity measures caused two confrontations in cabinet meetings, which Chokani attended.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965, pp. 91‚Äì2, 95-6. In the first, on 10 August 1964, all the ministers present asked Banda to stop making slighting references to them in speeches and not to hold so many government portfolios himself. In the more serious second confrontation, on 26 August 1964, the ministers present presented Banda with a list of grievances including his failure to Africanise, his relations with Portugal and South Africa and their own ambiguous position.C Baker, (2006). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 72‚Äì3.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 431, 451. Banda decided not to agree to the ministers' demands, and on 1 September, he advised the Governor-General of his intention re-form the cabinet replacing a number of them by his close followers. Three cabinet ministers were dismissed on 7 September: Banda apparently thought that the others would remain in office, but on the same day Chokani and two cabinet colleagues resigned in sympathy (a third one resigned two days later), precipitating the Cabinet Crisis of 1964.C Baker, (2006). Chipembere, the Missing Years, p. 77.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965 pp. 162‚Äì3. Leaving Malawi, Exile and Return The Governor-General attempted to mediate, and Banda's was willing to re-instate Chokani and one or two others, but the ministers' insistence that they should all be reinstated led to a failure of these initiatives. Later in September, clashes broke out between supporters of the ex-ministers and of Banda, and all hope of reconciliation faded. At the start of October 1964, Chokani and his colleague Augustine Bwanausi who had refused to rejoin the cabinet without their colleagues, left voluntarily for Zambia. Over the next few weeks several other ex-ministers fled the country because they feared for their safety.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 435, 437-40. In Zambia, Chokani became a headmaster again, of Kansenshi Secondary School, a school formerly under the control of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which he desegregated. He was headmaster here from 1969 to 1980. He later taught in the Northern Technical College (NORTECH), Ndola. During his enforced absence from Malawi, Chokani remained politically active and later moved to Tanzania as the treasurer of the Pan-African Democratic Party formed by another ex- minister, Henry Chipembere among Malawian exiles. He returned to Malawi in 1993 and was Malawi's Ambassador to the USA from 1994 to 1999, then Ambassador to Ethiopia and finally High Commissioner to Namibia before his retirement.O J M Kalinga, (2012).

He was killed by the Bulgarians at an ambush near Thessalonica ca. 991 or 995. Life Gregory was a son of Ashot III, prince of the region of Taron in southern Armenia. At Ashot's death in 967/8, Gregory and his brother, Bagrat (Pankratios in Greek) ceded Taron to the Byzantine Empire in exchange for extensive lands inside the Empire and the title of patrikios. The two brothers became involved in the civil wars between Emperor Basil II (r. 976‚Äì1025) and the mighty military aristocracy of Asia Minor, led by Bardas Phokas the Younger and Bardas Skleros. When Skleros rebelled in 976, they initially supported him, but soon switched over to the Emperor's side. In 988/9, during the revolt of Bardas Phokas, according to the historian Yahya of Antioch, Gregory, by now a magistros, was sent to recruit an army at Trebizond and lead it against Phokas. He was defeated en route by Phokas' son Nikephoros and his allies, the Iberians sent by David of Tao. Byzantine Greece in the 10th century Following the suppression of the magnates' revolts, Basil II turned his attention to the Balkans, where Samuel of Bulgaria was menacing the Byzantine territories. In 991 he campaigned in Macedonia and captured the fortress of Berroia, before returning to Constantinople. The emperor left Gregory Taronites in charge of the Balkan army and tasked him with stopping Samuel's raids. Taronites was named doux and made Thessalonica his seat. It is unclear whether in this context the title of doux implies simply a military command over the troops entrusted to him by the emperor, or, as it is usually interpreted, whether it includes the governorship of the theme of Thessalonica as well, which was previously held by a strategos. Some time after his appointment, Gregory Taronites was killed by the Bulgarians in an ambush near Thessalonica. A raiding party had approached the city, and Gregory sent out his son, Ashot, with the vanguard to make contact with them and reconnoitre. The over-eager Ashot engaged the Bulgarians and drove them back, but was drawn into a prepared ambush and encircled with his men. His father, following up with the main Byzantine force, rushed to his rescue, but was killed. The exact date of this event is unknown. The chronology of the account of John Skylitzes seems to place it in 996, while Armenian sources place it in 991. Modern research holds that it must have happened at the latest in mid-995, as John Chaldos is attested as doux of Thessalonica later in the same year. Family Along with his brother, Gregory was the founder of the noble Taronites family, which remained prominent in Byzantium until the end of the 12th century. Gregory's son Ashot was captured by the Bulgarians, but ended up marrying Samuel's daughter Miroslava and becoming governor of Dyrrhachium, which he soon surrendered back to the Byzantines. Gregory had at least another child, a daughter Irene, who was wed to Romanos Saronites.

The episode is co-written by series executive producers Dawn Prestwich and Nicole Yorkin and directed by Dan Attias. In the episode, frantic to find Adrian (Rowan Longworth), Stephen Holder (Joel Kinnaman) and Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) voice their suspicions about Carl Reddick (Gregg Henry) to James Skinner (Elias Koteas). Linden later sees a ring from the missing Kallie on Skinner's daughter's finger. She knows Skinner is the killer and must ride with him to find Adrian. Holder must race to save Linden when Adrian is found safe. Plot Holder and Linden ask Adrian's adoptive mother, Tess Clarke (Ingrid Torrance), if she has seen him. She grows worried when his backpack is found in the house and the back door is open. Adrian is missing. Skinner picks his daughter Bethany (Katherine Evans) up from ballet class. She asks if he loves the \\"woman from work,\\" meaning Linden. Her mother had told her about the situation. He explains that he can't be someone that he's not, but that he still loves Bethany. She wonders if things will change and he receives a call. He arrives at the Clarke house, where Holder and Linden tell him about Adrian possibly being abducted. Then, they suggest that they have the wrong man in jail for the murders. Reddick is their suspect. Skinner tells them to continue to search for Adrian, and he will handle the Reddick investigation. Holder and Linden then talk to Cammy Ezer (Jennifer Copping), a neighbor of the Clarkes'. Adrian had come to her house, scared, saying he was being followed. She was too busy to care for him and drove him home. At the station, Linden mentions security camera footage is being collected from the school to Adrian's house. She and Holder are met at the door by internal affairs agents. They wish to speak to Holder and take him inside. Linden tries to contact Skinner for his help with Holder. She is then given photos of a car following Adrian in several successions. The IA agents inform Holder they are investigating Holder for several reasons, besides his assault on Reddick. He surrenders his cell phone so they may check it. When Linden cannot reach Skinner by phone, she goes to his house. He is packing his clothes. She shows him the photo of the car following Adrian and he acts complacent. He tells her that she needs to be more thorough before accusing Reddick. On the way downstairs, his wife and daughter enter and see them together. The daughter is upset with his leaving and they hug. Linden sees Kallie Leeds's ring on Bethany's finger. She deduces that her former partner and lover is the serial killer. Believing that Skinner has Adrian held captive somewhere, she disarms him and forces him to take her to him. At the station, Holder tells the IA agents to call Skinner and the matter will be cleared up, but the agents inform him that Skinner was the one who filed the complaint, just before Holder arrived. Holder dupes the agents into believing that he has rigged Reddick's car with a bomb; his cell phone is the detonator. Reddick quickly arrives, upset that his family night out was interrupted by the prank. Holder is released and he asks Reddick for help to find Adrian. In the car, Skinner admits to Linden that he set Holder up with the IAD. At Skinner's home, Holder learns from his wife that Linden was with Skinner. He gets a possible address from the wife. Skinner tells Linden that things would be different if she would've walked away after Joe Mills was arrested. Holder heads out of town, looking at a map to find the address given to him. In Skinner's car, he claims that the first victim was an accident. She was supposed to be at junior officer's class and missed it. He went to look for her, finding her high on drugs and prostituting. He forced her into his car, struck her after she spat at him, and took her to the woods to keep her from talking to anyone about it. He claims to not remember much after that point. He mentions the exhilaration of killing the \\"human garbage\\" that nobody cares about. Reddick calls Holder. He has found a piece of paper with Adrian's writing on it, saying that, if his father dies, he wants to be with his mother. Holder says that the mother is dead, and Adrian might've meant his foster mother. Reddick investigates further. In the car, Linden suggests that Skinner wanted to kill Adrian for being a witness, but Skinner just wanted to know if the kid remembered him, which he didn't. Skinner was free, until Linden began to help Adrian remember. He insists that he doesn't kill children. She reminds him that some victims were 12 years old and asks why he killed them. He says he didn't need excuses. He suggests that Linden knows him and that she loved him. That's why she ended up in the psychiatric ward. Linden attacks him for mentioning that, causing him to stop the car. She gets out, exasperated, but knows she must continue the search for Adrian. They resume the ride and she asks where they are. He speaks of a nearby lake and she asks if that is where more bodies are. He says it's one of the places. He remains silent when she asks about Kallie Leeds. When they stop for the final time, he says that he is tired of hiding, confesses to Bullet's murder and easily making Joe Mills the suspect. Holder arrives at the cabin but finds no one there, not even Adrian. Out of the car, Linden asks where Adrian is and Skinner says that he has been with them the whole time in the car's trunk. Reddick finds Adrian at Trisha Seward's grave and calls Holder. Skinner tells Linden that he lied and regrets killing Adrian. Linden shoots him in the gut and Holder runs toward the sound. He arrives to tell her Adrian is alive, yet she keeps her gun pointed at Skinner, who tells her that she has to be the one to end it. Holder pleads with her to put her gun down and spare him, but is unsuccessful; Linden shoots him in the chest, killing him. Production In an August 2013 interview, Mireille Enos (Sarah Linden) talked about her response after reading the script for \\"The Road to Hamelin\\": \\"It's so powerful and intense ‚Äî and such a surprising twist for TV, to have her kill him. I was definitely surprised but ultimately I'm like, 'What other choice [did she have], considering everything that she's been through?' Veena [Sud] referred to this season as 'Sarah's Inferno. Considering everything that she had been through, and that he had been the catalyst for that ‚Äî her greatest potential for love was also the one who had not only done all these heinous crimes but allowed [Seward] to go to death, allowed her to go to this hospital and think that she was crazy, allowed her to be put in a situation where Joe Mills beat her up ... he was responsible for all of these horrifying things. Ultimately I don't know what other choice Sarah would have made.\\" Reception =Critical reception= \\"The Road to Hamelin\\" was reviewed in conjunction with \\"From Up Here\\" as a two-part season finale. Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic stated, \\"In a two hours that could have easily dragged and become bloated, [the] season finale of The Killing Season 3 found a way to be compelling, exciting, focused on the characters as much as finishing the case, and providing one heck of an ending.\\" The A.V. Club's Phil Dyess-Nugent gave the finale a B+ grade, stating, \\"The pieces fit, and the revelation that Skinner, the cop who put the wrongly convicted Ray Seward away, was actually covering up his own crimes, alters the story in a way that, if anything, makes more sense, not less.\\" =Ratings= The two-part season finale was watched by 1.48 million viewers, a slight increase from the second season's finale, as well as the previous episode, and got a 0.5 rating in the 18-49 ages demographic.

Entrance to the Leadville Hebrew Cemetery Besides the synagogue building, the Temple Israel Foundation also maintains the Leadville Hebrew Cemetery, to which it gained title in 1993. The cemetery is located outside of Leadville, about 3/4 of a mile from the synagogue. Records show that 132 people were interred in this cemetery from its establishment in 1880 through 1981, though only 5 of those died after 1930. 59 of the original headstones remain, and the Foundation has provided markers for those that are missing. The Foundation opened a section of the cemetery for new interments in 2001 with space for 51 graves, of which 8 were occupied as of 2015. The cemetery is largely maintained through a volunteer effort led by the Denver chapter of B'nai B'rith.

The game is developed by Blue Manchu Games headed by Irrational Games co-founder, Jon Chey. The development team also consists of other former Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios employees, as well as consultants who previously worked on Magic: The Gathering. It was initially released as a web-browser based game in September 2013, with a standalone client released for Microsoft Windows and OS X in July 2015. Gameplay Card Hunter is presented to the player as a gaming session with gamemaster Gary who is guiding the player through a tabletop role-playing game, using dungeon modules similar to those of Dungeons & Dragons which consist of 1 or more encounters. Part of this fiction is Gary himself is still learning the ropes; at the start of the player's career, Gary is using his older brother Melvin's more powerful characters to demonstrate the core mechanics of the game, but later his brother takes these away, forcing Gary and the player to start anew. The player generates a party of up to three characters; more characters can be recruited and swapped in and out between modules. Characters are selected by class, which determine equipment type they can use, and race, which grant special bonuses during combat. Each character has a deck of 36 cards which are determined by class, race, and their current equipment. Initially, the amount of equipment each character carries is limited, but as the characters gain experience points, they gain more equipment slots, expanding the abilities through new cards that enter their deck, allowing players to customize their characters. Equipment can only be swapped out between battles, and various stores, with both normal stock and time-limited exclusives, can be used to buy and sell equipment and treasure at this time. Card Hunter has a microtransaction ability to spend real-world money as to gain access to better loot from the end of encounters or to open prize chests that contain random equipment. As such, the game is considered to combine the collectible card aspects of Magic the Gathering with the role- player concepts of Dungeons & Dragons. Once ready, the player selects one of the available modules in the campaign that they have access to, including revisiting completed modules. Modules are given difficulty levels, with more difficult modules featuring stronger enemies but also having more powerful randomly determined loot to be collected at the end of each encounter and more experience awarded at the end of the module. Card Hunter uses a tabletop board metaphor to represent combat. The player's characters (on bottom) and Gary's characters (top) use cards to determine how to move about the board. Each encounter is played out on a rectangular game board typical of a tabletop game, with the player's and Gary's characters represented as stand-up game pieces. At the start, each character is dealt four cards from their shuffled deck. The player and Gary take turns playing one card from any of their controlled characters, which allow the character to move, attack, or cast spells; these actions take into account the layout of the gameboard, such as line-of-sight and rough terrain that slows movement. Other cards are passive, such as cards that may block attacks. Cards may provide other effects, such as buffs or persistent effects. Once a card is played, it generally returns to a discard pile, though certain passive cards are retained. The player or Gary may pass instead of playing a card or may have run out of cards; the round continues until both the player and Gary have both passed. At this point a new round is started; if a character holds more than two cards, they must discard down to two, and then each character is dealt new cards (typically three) from their deck, reshuffled from the discard pile as needed. Combat continues until either side earns enough victory points to win. Victory points are awarded typically when an enemy character is defeated, but other victory conditions can exist. In addition to the single-player campaign, there is a player-vs- player mode, where players take their current characters or preset characters sets into battle against each other. With the release of the standalone client in July 2015, the game added a new expansion which added science-fiction related adventures and items, and included co-operative play with either two or three players. In this mode, each player controls one character; if only two players, there is no third character but each player gets an extra card to draw to make up for this. The players can work through one complete adventure together. The game is supported by microtransactions provided by buying a separate in-game currency called \\"pizza\\" for real money. The pizza can be used to purchase new cutouts which change the cosmetic look of one's character, chests which contain random items, or gold. A subscription model is also available, where players can spend pizza to join the \\"Card Hunters Club\\", membership to which grants an additional loot item after each battle. Development Blue Manchu Games was formed by Chey after he left Irrational Games, which had been sold to 2K Games and re-branded as 2K Australia. Chey formed Blue Manchu as a self-funded studio with the intention of creating games that interested him, and had no provable mass appeal so it would be difficult to attract investors. Work began in August 2010, and the game was developed in secret until being announced in July 2011. The team working on Card Hunter began as a distributed organisation with Chey as the only full- time employee. Reception Jerry Holkins (Tycho) of Penny Arcade selected Card Hunter as his favourite game of PAX 2012.

Formative years and early career Salmon was born in Lansingburg (now Troy, New York), the son of a physician. and entered the Albany Medical College. He received his M.D. in 1899. He began his medical practice in Brewster, New York but left it 1901. He worked at Willard State Hospital to investigate a diphtheria epidemic, and became New York State mental hospital bacteriologist. The two years he spent at Willard gave him entry into the world of psychiatry. Salmon entered the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) in 1903. The following year, he was assigned to the Immigration Station on Ellis Island to examine the immigrants arriving from Europe. At that time, Federal law excluded entry of immigrants with evidence of mental illness, feeble mindedness, epilepsy, or criminal background. Detainees were kept at Ellis Island until arrangements could be made to return to Europe. Salmon was distressed by the poor conditions under which the detainees were kept and pressed his superiors for improvements at Ellis Island. He also urged that those applying for entry into the United States be examined at the port of embarkation to weed out those with excludable conditions. He was unsuccessful and was transferred to a Public Health Service hospital in Chelsea, Massachusetts where he practiced general medicine for four years. He was assigned as medical officer to provide care to fishermen. On his return, he recommended to the Public Health Service that a hospital ship be provided to give medical care to the northeastern fishing communities. He wrote articles and testified before U.S. Congressional committees. His efforts in bypassing his superiors were not met kindly. However, five years later, Congress authorized a hospital ship. In 1911, the New York State Commission in Lunacy asked the Public Health Service to grant Salmon a leave of absence from the Public Health Service to study the problems of foreign-born patients in state mental hospitals. Salmon organized statistical surveys and helped to devise a uniform system of reporting admissions and discharges. Mental hygiene movement During the years of Salmon‚Äôs work in the Public Health Service, a new movement was under way. Clifford Beers, a Yale graduate living in Connecticut became mentally ill. He was confined for three years in private and public mental hospitals where he received harsh treatment. Upon his recovery, he was determined to bring better care to mental patients. He wrote and published a book in 1909 titled A Mind that Found Itself which received favorable comments from lay and professional groups. With their help, Beers organized the Connecticut Association for Mental Hygiene and the following year he led the formation of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene. The aims of the organization were to raise standards of care for the mentally ill, to study and disseminate information about the illness, to seek methods of prevention, and to foster the organization of a mental hygiene society in each state. Funds for the new organization came from private philanthropists and foundations. Salmon joined the National Committee for Mental Hygiene. Beers served as Secretary and Salmon became the Director of Special Surveys and his first task was to obtain information about conditions in state mental hospitals. More than 60 surveys were carried out in state and county hospitals in 35 states and the information was reported to state legislatures, which led to reforms in many states. In 1915, Salmon was given the title of Medical Director of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene and he resigned from the Public Health Service. Military service In 1914, the U.S. Surgeon General established the position of Chief of Psychiatry under Dr. Pearce Bailey, an eminent neurologist. Salmon became interested in war psychiatry during World War I and in 1916, with Bailey visited the U.S. troops at the Mexican border and discovered that the rate of psychiatric disorders among soldiers was higher than among the civilian populations. The following year, Salmon went to England to study hospital care for soldiers suffering from ‚Äúshell shock‚Äù which was then considered a war-related neurosis. His visit resulted in a detailed report titled The Care and Treatment of Mental Disorders and war neuroses (Shell Shock) in the British Army and included recommendations for a U.S. program in the event the country went to war. These recommendations included the screening of recruits before induction, the organizing of base hospitals and treatment centers, and the recruitment and training of physicians, nurses, reconstruction aides (occupational therapists) and social workers to care for the patients. In March, 1918, Colonel Salmon was asked to form a psychiatric base hospital at Camp Crane in Pennsylvania as part of the Army's newly formed neuropsychiatric service. His hospital team was deployed to La Fauche, France in May, 1918, and at the time represented one of the first successful wartime deployments of reconstruction aides, later known as occupational therapists. Based on his successes in France, Salmon became an advocate for use of reconstruction aides in the treatment of soldiers suffering from functional war neuroses. Post-war career When the war ended, Salmon became concerned with the plight of returning veterans who suffered from mental disorders. The veterans were first sent to state, county, and private mental hospitals, but their needs were greater than the hospitals could offer. Salmon pushed for the establishment of veteran hospitals around the country. Officials in Washington, DC were not favorable to the proposal but with the aid of the American Legion and other veteran groups, Congress eventually authorized the establishment of the Veterans Administration (VA). The first VA director was Dr. C.R. Forbes who soon ignored the psychiatrists‚Äô recommendations regarding hospital care for veterans. Beginning in 1920, Salmon worked with Pennsylvania's Commonwealth Fund to help create a juvenile delinquency research program and start clinics that offered services to children with emotional or behavioral problems. Salmon left the National Committee for Mental Hygiene in January 1922 and ended his work for the Commonwealth Fund later that year. He later accepted a professorship of psychiatry at the Columbia University in New York City. Salmon was elected as president of the American Psychiatric Association in 1923; he was the first president who had not been employed as a mental hospital superintendent. On August 13, 1927, Salmon died in the Long Island Sound while sailing. He was buried in Dorset, Vermont.

Chebi is the third typhoon since Typhoon Xangsane to hit the country destructively. The 30th tropical depression developed east of the Mariana Islands on October 31 as a weak disturbance. The system was dubbed into a tropical depression on November 8, until both the JMA and PAGASA upgraded it to a tropical storm on November 9. Chebi rapidly intensified to a Category 4 typhoon the next day and made landfall over northern Philippines on November 11. The system finally dissipated near Hong Kong and Vietnam on November 14. The name Chebi is a misspelling for Jebi and was corrected in 2007, which means swallow in Korean. Meteorological history Preparations and impact =Philippines= Typhoon Chebi at peak intensity on November 10 Typhoon Chebi entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) on November 10 and was named Queenie by PAGASA. On November 11, just after its peak intensity, Chebi made landfall over Aurora, Philippines near Casiguran. Public Storm Warning Signal #2, meaning winds extending from 60 to 100 kp/h, is up over southern Isabela, Quirino, Aurora, northern Quezon and Polillo Island. Cagayan, Isabela, Ifugao, Nueva Vizcaya, Bulacan, Quezon, Camarines provinces and Catanduanes have been placed under Signal #1. On November 13, Chebi exited the PAR with both the PAGASA and NDRRMC stopped warning on the system. The PNRC is also preparing relief supplies to be distributed to families in the barangays of Dibulo and Digomased where an estimated 300 families have been evacuated within the Municipality of Dinapegue. However, initial actions have included the establishment of a tent camp in the city of Calamba, one hour south of Manila, set up in three days from November 8 to 11 to accommodate 87 families. The camp's capacity is 300 families. The ICRC provided two emergency water storage bladders, one for 10,000 litres and one for 5,000 litres. The camp is managed by the city administration, which is finishing constructions of latrines, showers, cooking and laundry facilities. About 8,300 people who evacuated flooded villages in San Jose have returned home, the civil defense office said. All told, the typhoon caused further casualties as well as damage caused by the earlier Typhoon Cimaron. Landslides, overflowing rivers, toppled trees and power lines blocked several roads to Casiguran and Dinapigue town in nearby Isabela province. Strong winds destroyed two houses and damaged a dozen others in Casiguran. The OCD said most of the floodwaters in the area have receded by early of November 12, but some rice crops were damaged in San Jose city in Nueva Ecija province where some farms were submerged under about 1.2 meters (four feet) of water. A total of 1,676 houses were damaged in Dipaculao, Casiguran and Dinalungan, Aurora Province. In Aurora Province, it caused floods, cutting the province's road system, as well as zero visibility, further isolating it from relief efforts. Initial assessments from chapters in Aurora, Isabela and Nueva Ecija say 4,624 families have had their homes destroyed or damaged. There have also been reports of power outages and roads once again being cut off. A total of 3,958 families or 21,250 persons were affected in 38 barangays of 7 municipalities and 1 city in the provinces of Isabela, Aurora and Nueva Ecija. There were 10 persons reported injured in Casiguran, Aurora. One person was reported dead in San Jose City, Nueva Ecija with five missing in Sabang, Baler, Aurora. =Vietnam= Meteorologists predicted the typhoon would start building up and heading directly west across the Eastern Sea by evening of November 12. Chebi was located several kilometers east of Luzon in the Philippines and was reportedly generating Category 14 to 15 winds (150‚Äì183 km/h) around the center. On November 13, at that stage the Central Hydro-Meteorological Center predicted the storm would steer west-northwest at 10‚Äì15 km/h and bring winds gusting up to 150 km/h. If the meteorologists have got it right in their latest prediction, the eighth storm to set its sights on Viet Nam this year should begin weakening in the next 24 hours. Chebi had weakened into a tropical depression on November 14 and was no longer threatened the central region, Vietnam's National Hydrometeorological Forecast Center said. Even so, Viet Nam's eighth storm of the year, Chebi, was strong enough to produce waves as high as four meters around the Hoang Sa Islands in the Eastern Sea.

Career Shukla gained his master's degree in Organic Chemistry in 1969 from the University of Allahabad and his Ph.D. in 1973 from the same university. Subsequently, he received a post-doctoral UNESCO award and did work first at the Charles University in Prague and then in 1975 at the Institute of Neurochemistry in Experimental Life Sciences in Copenhagen, and at the Federal Centre for Lipid Research in M√ºnster, Germany. In 1979 he was appointed R&D; manager by then Aarhus Oliefabrik (now AarhusKarlshamn), a leading company in the manufacture of vegetable oils and specialty fats. In 1990 he joined Karlshamn as Research Director, and started his own company in 1991, IFSC, of which he is still President.\\"Verdensmanden fra Lystrup\\" in Aarhus Stiftstidende, 2005 Shukla's research includes both the field of physical phenomena and the mechanisms of autoxidation, isolation of lipids, spectral phenomena related to lipids (e.g. pulsed Nuclear magnetic resonance), modern analytical methodology, and involvement of essential fatty acids in health and disease such as multiple sclerosis and Batten Disease where he has made significant scientific contributions.

Parishioners prepare by cleaning family graves and, in some cemeteries, decorating the graves. Grave decorations incorporate flowers as well as crafts and mementos. In cemeteries where a priest is not available, Cemetery Sunday may still be held absent the formal service and blessing.  Dates observed  In Ireland, the date varies by parish, and is typically in summer. Parishes coordinate to avoid scheduling Cemetery Sunday on the same week so that families can attend services at all cemeteries where their relatives are buried. For churches which are no longer used, Cemetery Sunday can the only regularly held service on the grounds. In the United States, Cemetery Sunday is the first Sunday in November, around the time of All Souls' Day.  Observance in Ireland  = Earliest Irish observances = St. James Church (Church of Ireland) in Dublin, had an long-established tradition of cemetery cleaning and decoration in conjunction with the Fair of St. James, historically held on July 25, the Pattern Sunday for St. James. There are records of burials at St. James as early as 1495 and it is believed that the cemetery may have been in use as early as the 13th century. There is no known documentation of when cemetery decoration began at the St. James Cemetery, but it was well established by the early 19th century. The fair itself was banned from the public streets by the 1730s but continued in a smaller way next to the cemetery through the 1820s. In 1821, G. N. Wright wrote of a custom to \\"deck the graves with garlands and ornaments, made of white paper, disposed into very extraordinary forms\\". By 1828, Nicholas Carlisle characterized St. James cemetery decoration as an custom that was already old: Burials continued in the St. James Cemetery through the 19th and 20th century before ceasing completely due to the closure of the cemetery.  Ritual elements  = Cemetery maintenance and decoration =  Cleaning  For days or weeks before the designated Cemetery Sunday at a particular cemetery, family members of those buried there work to clean and tidy the graves. This may also include removing overgrown plants and debris from the cemetery and other general maintenance to the grounds.  Flowers  Cemetery decoration often features cut flowers. Homemade crepe paper flowers were also common in early St. James cemetery decoration. Today, artificial flowers are often used. Flowers can be placed on graves in any number of ways, including in patterns.  Grave tokens  Decoration can include the placing of tokens at individual graves. Tokens are often personal or household items significant to the relationship between the person who places the token and the deceased. = Festivities =  Homecomings and family reunions  Relatives of the deceased often choose Cemetery Sundays to return home for visits and reunions after moving away.  Food and drink  Food is a common element in many Cemetery Sunday traditions.  Music and singing  Singing is also common but not universal.  Connection to Decoration Day in Appalachia and Liberia  Scholar Barbara Graham connects Cemetery Sunday traditions to the Decoration Day traditions of Appalachia and Liberia as many Irish and Scotch-Irish refugees and other immigrants from Ireland settled in Central and Southern Appalachia.

The members have all played in influential punk and rock bands from Sweden. It is the music project of Swedish Punk rock musician Dennis Lyxz√©n. In contrast to his other projects, Refused and The (International) Noise Conspiracy, this started out as a solo career and much more folkish and softer than his prior music endeavors. Sara Almgren used to be in the first Swedish all-female straight-edge band The Doughnuts. She later played keyboard and guitar in The (International) Noise Conspiracy and has also played in bands like The Vicious and Masshysteri. She has also toured with Marit Bergman and Sahara Hotnights. Dennis Lyxzen is most known for being the lead vocalist in Refused but has also played in bands like The (International) Noise Conspiracy, AC4 and many more. He has also been a touring member of The Bloody Beetroots. Anders Stenberg is a member of acclaimed Swedish band the Deportees and also a touring member of Lykke Li's band. Christina Karlsson, besides playing in INVSN she also plays with bands and artist such as Frida Selander, Tiger Forest Cat and Honungsv√§gen. Andre Sandstr√∂m hails from Swedish hardcore thrashers DS-13 and has also played in bands like The Vicious and Ux Vileheads. History =Origins= The band had previously chosen the Lost Patrol Band moniker; however, they were forced to change this to Invasionen as the American group, The Lost Patrol has the North American trademark of the name. While the name changed, so did the music, and the band started to write in Swedish. In 1999, Lyxz√©n put together a release titled \\"Songs in the Key of Resistance\\" which was written in the political vein. The album received mixed reactions with the critics lamenting the album for straying from its creator's punk roots. Others were impressed by Lyxz√©n's ability to diversify his musical output. The Lost Patrol returned in 2003 with \\"Songs about Running Away\\". According to Lyxz√©n, the album had been supposed to be just as subversive and political as his previous album, yet due to relationship problems, it ended up being an emotional outburst. Guests such as David Sandstr√∂m (Refused), Stefan Granberg (Randy) and Lisa Miskovsky helped to make this album one of Lyxz√©n's most experimental. In 2005, Burning Heart Records reported that The Lost Patrol has grown from Lyxz√©n's solo project into a full-fledged band. This is reflected in the title of the 2005 album The Lost Patrol Band. The album also represents a further change in style, this time encompassing the upbeat sounds of 1970s/'80s punk and power pop. In 2013 the group signed to Razor & Tie and changed their name to INVSN. In 2010 Invasionen released their debut album Hela V√§rlden Brinner on Sony Music in Sweden. A vinyl version of the record was released on Dennis' own label Ny V√•g Records. Shortly after the record was released Robert Pettersson left the band to focus on his band Masshysteri. Richard √ñsterman replaced him on bass. Since the album was only released in Sweden and the lyrics were in Swedish they mainly just touring Sweden but also did some shows in Spain. The first album \\"Hela V√§rlden Brinner\\" could be described as a tribute to early Swedish punkrock. In the fall of 2011 the sophomore album \\"Saker Som jag Sagt Till Natten\\" was released once again on Sony Music. The album got good reviews in Sweden and when they started playing shows Sara Almgren from Masshysteri had joined the band on bas and Richard had moved to guitar due to Anders touring duties with Lykke Li. The album had a darker and more serious tone then the previous album. In the fall of 2011 they also did a tour of China before touring Scandinavia. In 2012 the band was largely on a break due to Dennis Lyxz√©n's commitment to the Refused reunion. They still managed to play over 20 shows and write the material that would end up on their next record. =INVSN= In 2013 the group recorded their third album and signed to Razor & Tie and changed their name to INVSN (Pronounced \\"Invasion\\"). The record was recorded in both English for an international Release and Swedish for a domestic release in Sweden. The english version of the album was released on 24 September and the band set out on a tour in North America supporting Minus The Bear. Before the tour Richard √ñsterman stepped down from touring duties and Christina Karlsson and Kajsa Bergsten joined. During 2013-2014 the band did over 110 shows all over the world. 2 Tours of North America, a trip to Cuba and a couple of European tours, one with Against Me!. The Album got great reviews in Europe but not much happened in America due to a lack of interest on the labels part. They ended 2014 with releasing a limited vinyl 7\\" on Sony Music with the song Hj√§rtat and a split 7\\" with Sister Mystery from Los Angeles. And in November they did a short run of the UK with Echo and The Bunnymen. 2015 was a quiet year for INVSN due to a new Refused record. In the fall of 2015 they however did a short Scandinavian tour together with The Soft Moon. In 2016 INVSN announced their return with new music. They got signed to new Swedish label Woah Dad! in Scandinavia and released their first single from the upcoming album The Beautiful Stories, Immer Zu on 21 October in the nordic countries.

Green and starring Douglas Kennedy as a newspaper reporter who goes undercover to expose political corruption and the exploitation of chain gang labour.  Plot  After a state senator's bill to abolish chain gangs is rejected by the Senate, newspaper reporter Cliff Roberts (Kennedy) persuades his boss Pop O'Donnel (Harry Cheshire) at the liberal Capitol City Evening Standard to arrange for him to go undercover in a chain gang prison. Equipped with false employment records and a tiny microfilm camera disguised as a cigarette lighter, he tells everyone‚Äîincluding girlfriend Rita McKelvey (Marjorie Lord), a reporter for a rival newspaper‚Äîthat he is going on a fishing trip, but actually heads for Cloverdale Prison Farm in the deep south, scene of recent incidents which left three inmates dead. The prison's Captain Duncan (Emory Parnell) supplies labour in the form of chain gangs, which are ostensibly for state construction projects but in reality are being exploited by Rita's stepfather, local entrepreneur John McKelvey (Thurston Hall), for his construction projects. Working as a guard, Roberts secretly photographs prison conditions, arriving in time to witness the recapturing of an escaped inmate who is sent for an overnight stay in the sweatbox as punishment. Roberts is supplied with a bullwhip and is required to use it when a convict ‚Äì Snead (William Phillips) ‚Äì is caught covering up for another inmate who can't work well enough at the construction site. Under Captain Duncan's orders, Roberts reluctantly flogs Snead at the whipping post. Later he visits Snead in solitary confinement to apologise for the whipping and gains the inmate's trust. Roberts' secret photographs are published in the newspaper, much to McKelvey's consternation.\\"Chain Gang (1950, USA)\\". Prison Movies. A foreman on the construction project (who knows Roberts as Jack Granger) sees his photograph in McKelvey house. His cover blown, Roberts uses the confusion of fellow prisoner Snead's escape to make a run for it. The two men try to outrun the guards and their dogs across wilderness and through woodland. Roberts is shot and left for dead by Captain Duncan, who later pins the blame on Snead. Roberts eventually makes it to safety and is reunited with Rita. Snead is killed while on the run and McKelvey is charged with the exploitation of convict labor for personal gain.

ADP is based on the same principles as the gold standard method of hydrostatic weighing, but through a densitometric technique that uses air displacement rather than water immersion. Air-displacement plethysmography offers several advantages over established reference methods, including a quick, comfortable, automated, noninvasive, and safe measurement process, and accommodates various subject types (e.g., children, obese, elderly, and disabled persons). History The principles of plethysmography were first applied to the measurement of the body volume and composition of infants in the early 1900s, but it was not until the 1960s that relatively stable measurements were achieved. However, these systems required that ambient conditions be maintained constant. Applications in humans have been limited, in part by technical difficulties in adjusting for irregularities in temperature and humidity of the air next to the skin and the air. Because of inconveniences such as these and various technology difficulties, none of the early air-displacement plethysmographs were ever developed for common, everyday use. Later experimental air- displacement plethysmographs developed in the 1980s were more advanced technologically, but it was only in the mid-1990s, that the first commercially available air-displacement plethysmograph was introduced for adults and early 2000 for infants How it works With air-displacement plethysmography, the volume of an object is measured indirectly by determining the volume of air it displaces inside an enclosed chamber (plethysmograph). Thus, human body volume is measured when a subject sits inside the chamber and displaces a volume of air equal to his or her body volume. Body volume is calculated indirectly by subtracting the volume of air remaining inside the chamber when the subject is inside from the volume of air in the chamber when it is empty. The volume of air inside the chamber is calculated by slightly changing the size of the chamber (e.g. by moving a diaphragm in one of the walls) and applying relevant physical gas laws to determine the total volume from the changing air pressure within the chamber as its size is altered. Boyle's law states that at a constant temperature, volume (V) and pressure (P) are inversely related. Therefore, when a constant temperature is maintained (isothermal conditions), Boyle's law can be applied. Consequently, most early plethysmographs required temperature-controlled surroundings and isothermal conditions within the test chamber. Validations Air displacement plethysmographs have been validated against main body composition assessment techniques: *Hydrostatic weighing *Main Reference Methods **Hydrostatic weighing **Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry **Measurement of Total Body Water (TBW) by isotope dilution **Measurement of total body potassium **Multi-compartment models *Deuterium method (in infants) * Whole body magnetic resonance tomography.

Recording  The recording of Studio Zoo was being streamed live online, 24/7 for 5 weeks from 11 June 2013. His home studio in East London was set up with 4 cameras, to allow fans to follow every detail of recording the album ‚Äì with no producer or engineer, only Faulkner and a few guests, such as The X Factor's Janet Devlin and Ted Dwane (of Mumford & Sons). Fans were also able to follow regular updates on the social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter. The campaign used the hashtag #StudioZoo which allowed users tweets to play sounds in Faulkner's house. The campaign concluded in a party at Faulkner's house with a set jungle. There was a toy jeep which would drive forward every time someone tweeted #StudioZoo. The #StudioZoo campaign was created and ran by Powster. \\"I am as excited as I am terrified by the prospect of having a house full of cameras film me while trying to record an album. The entire recording process will be streamed live and nothing has been recorded in advance - apart from some particularly good hand claps recorded in Paris. The album will be made before your very eyes, no tricks, no producer and no engineer, just me, a guitar and a few surprise guests,\\" said Faulkner. \\"With the whole album I gave myself relatively strict rules. The main criticism I‚Äôve had in the past has been that my recordings have been overly layered and polished. So as this is the first album I‚Äôve ever produced myself, I aimed to make sure this wasn‚Äôt the case. I limited myself to one guitar part per track, which meant I pushed my playing considerably further than ever before. I also tried to harmonise with myself as little as possible vocally,\\" he said in an interview with The Independent. \\"So that the main guitar part and lead vocal had to carry every track the way it does when I play live. I did allow myself to get in great players and singers to add more light and shade. Andreya Trianna and Janet Devlin both did awesome harmonies and guitar-wise I was joined by some of best acoustic guitarists in the world, Thomas Leeb and Nick Harper. Ted Dwane from Mumford and Sons played some double bass and India Borne, who plays cello and bunch of stuff for Ben Howard, popped in too. I was very lucky.\\" Promotion The lead single to promote the album, \\"Losing Ground\\", was released on 8 September 2013. Faulkner said that the song \\"is about battling on even when you know you're on the back foot. You go through ups and downs and it's about being in a down but being ok with it, because you know there must be an up on the way... hopefully.\\" A music video for the song, created by London-based motion graphics company Powster, was released onto YouTube on 21 August 2013.

It is the only U.S.-based organization enshrined in the ASEAN charter. Headquartered in Washington, DC, the Council has offices in New York City, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Myanmar. The Council represents more than 160 of the largest US corporations. Former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, at the USABC 25th Anniversary. History The Council was created in response to a request from the ASEAN governments at the ASEAN-US dialogue of 1984. First known as the \\"US-ASEAN Center for Technology Exchange,\\" the Council's mission was to enhance trade and investment opportunities for US companies in ASEAN, and to increase the ASEAN countries' access to US sources of technology and training. President Ronald Reagan remarked on the Council's founding, \\"You are embarking on a most important and innovative private sector initiative to strengthen the United States presence and our competitiveness in Southeast Asia.\\" In 1989, The US-ASEAN Center for Technology Exchange absorbed the ASEAN-US Business Council that had been housed in the United States Chamber of Commerce since 1979. Following the merger, the Council took the name of the US-ASEAN Council for Business and Technology. The name was formally changed to US-ASEAN Business Council in 1997. Since the Council's founding in 1984, there has been remarkable growth in trade between the United States and ASEAN, reaching US$198.5 billion in 2012. Industry committees The Council's working group committees include all ten ASEAN nations, as well as industry portfolios: Customs & Trade Facilitation, Defense & Security, Energy, Financial Services, Food & Agriculture, Health and Life Sciences, Information & Communications Technology, Infrastructure, Manufacturing, and Travel & Tourism. Through these committees, the Council works to solve problems and facilitate opportunities in varying market conditions. Its Financial Service Committee, for instance, is a participant of the annual ASEAN Finance Ministers' and Central Bank Governors' Meeting (AFMGM), thus giving the Council the capacity to raise and advocate member company concerns. The Council's Energy Committee, currently chaired by Chevron, represents specific industries ranging from geothermal, coal based methane and wind energy to oil & gas, natural resources and nuclear energy. Programs and events The Council conducts several programs and events to promote mutual dialogue between US businesses and leading political figures of Southeast Asia. Programs include ASEAN Trade/Economic Ministers' and Ambassadors' Roadshows; annual Business Missions to Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam; presenting of the Council's Lifetime Achievement Award to Singapore's Minister Mentor and First Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew; and dinner galas hosted in honour of foreign dignitaries, including former Myanmar President Thein Sein, President of the Philippines Benigno Aquino III, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and Vietnamese President Truong Tan Sang on each of their visits to the United States.. President of Vietnam, Truong Tan Sang speaks at a dinner gala co- hosted by the US-ASEAN Business Council and the United States Chamber of Commerce Membership The Council membership includes over 160 leading US corporations across several business sectors. Members engage at either the Corporate or Chairman's Council level. Previous Chairs of the Council include Keith Williams, Chairman and CEO of UL LLC, Maurice Greenberg, Chairman and CEO of C.V. Starr and Co., Inc, Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, Roderick Hills, Chairman of Hills Companies and Charles Williamson, Chairman and CEO of Unocal Corporation. US-ASEAN Business Council Institute A sister organisation of the Council, The US-ASEAN Business Council Institute is a 501(c)(3) charitable organisation primarily focused on humanitarian activities and community engagement. US-ASEAN Business Council Institute initiatives aim to improve the lives of people in Southeast Asia, and to provide support for programs that preserve and expand knowledge about the rich cultural and art heritage of the ASEAN region. Additionally, the Institute works on initiatives related to education, governance and rule of law, health, and the environment.

She is the daughter of a composer and a painter, beginning a career in modeling and cinema before moving into photographic work in the 1960s. She began with portrait work, with one of her first clients being longtime partner Salvador Elizondo, and later breaking into more artistic work with a series of nudes for the magazine Su Otro Yo. She has photographed many subjects from the Mexican art scene as well as images of people in every day activity, mostly in Mexico. She is a member of the . Life Lavista was born in Mexico City to composer Ra√∫l Lavista and painter Elena Lavista. Her father composed music for the cinema and she grew up around music from Chopin to opera to Elvis Presley as well as the visual arts. She was the second of four children, with an older sister dying of typhoid fever. The children had a lot of freedom growing up but Lavista states that they were also alone because of their parents‚Äô demanding careers. She thought of being a writer growing up but also remembers being fascinated by a photograph of a ballerina in mid-air. She always had problems at school, attending middle and high school in five different schools before entering the (CUEC). She was the first class of the new institution, with Jaime Humberto Hermosillo. However shortly after entering the family finances took a downturn and she decided to turn to modeling to earn money. She had success in this, appearing in commercials for chewing gum and hair dye. After this she worked in movie productions in the 1960s with Aldo Monti and then with Rafael Corkidi and Antonio Reynoso in their company Cine-Foto. This prompted her to return to CUEC to continue her studies. During this time she met photographers such as Juan Rulfo and H√©ctor Garc√≠a Cobo, which inspired her to explore photography. She continued with cinema, she worked on production of Fando y Lis by Jodorwsky and Mariana by Juan Guerrero. She was a production manager with Publicidad Ferrer and during the 1968 Summer Olympics she coordinated visual works. In her early photographic career, one of her first clients was Salvador Elizondo, doing his portrait for his book Farabeuf. They have been a couple since. Both considered to be enfant terribles, against common social morals. Career She was drawn to photography at age fifteen, dreaming of working for National Geographic or Playboy magazine. She became frustrated with the cinema industry and began to take portraits at age eighteen. Her portrait work included images of Eduardo Mata in an easy chair in his house in Tepoztl√°n, Francisco Toledo in his studio, Rufino Tamayo in Los Pinos, Graciela Iturbide in the home of Manuel √Ålvarez Bravo and her father Ra√∫l Lavista at his piano. She has photographed other notable figures such as Octavio Paz, Juan Jos√© Gurrola, Ofelia Medina, Mar√≠a F√©lix, Juan Jos√© Arreola, Jorge Luis Borges, Juan Rulfo, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, and Emilio Fern√°ndez . She has also done a number of self-portraits, alone or with partner Salvador Elizondo. In 1965, she began working with the magazine ' to create a series of nudes working with models and nightclub artists such as Lyn Mei, Gloriella and Roc√≠o Rilke. In 1968 Lavista was the Assistant Production Supervisor for the 1968 film on the Olympic Games held in Mexico City that year. Lavista had her first exhibition of her artistic photography, called Photemas, at the Palacio de Bellas Artes. Since then her work has been exhibited individually or collectively at the Museo Carrillo Gil, the Foro de Arte Contempor√°neo, the Cada del Lago, the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana and the Chopo Museum all in Mexico City as well as at the K√ºnstlerhaus Bethanien in Berlin .

Although she has an intellectual approach to photography, often learning from contemporaries, she has also been controversial, provoking the enmity of colleagues, testing the limits of her field to avoid simply being a taker of images. Space constraints led her to develop two formats which she called historieta (lit.comic) and the other foto-texto (photo-text) over ten years. However when they were exhibited at the , there was controversy at the following roundtable, which concluded that these were not \\"photography.\\" However, she did the same kind of work for an exhibition in 1991 at the Casa del Lago in Mexico City. Lavista does diverse themes but movement is a prevailing element, shown in images such as that of ballerinas or flying birds. This reflects her admiration for the work of Eadweard Muybridge on locomotion and the movement in general of both animals and people in sequence. She is also noted for photographs of people in everyday scenes, mostly in Mexico City, but also in other areas of Mexico such as Alvarado, Veracruz, Tepoztl√°n, Guanajuato, various scenes in Quintana Roo as well as New York, Guatemala and Colombia.

Her work was always independent from fashions and trends, and it represents an original addition to Spanish plastic arts. Her particular use of unmodified rocks and stones, as a support for her paintings, was an important part of her legacy. The characters that usually inhabit the strange structures in her paintings adapt themselves to the grooves in the stones, resulting in a surprising combination of painting and sculpture.

There her talent impressed teachers, as proven by her high grades and the awards she received. Later, however, these same teachers were to feel disappointed when, after finishing her training, she left the mainstream Realism, which she mastered, to start a new path, breaking away from the established styles. Challenged by the dominant traditionalism, \\"She began working at what was starting to be called 'Modern Art', and refused to submit to the interfering past\\", declared Jos√© Mar√≠a Moreno Galv√°nSpain.info at the presentation of her first individual exhibition in Madrid (1954). After this first exhibition, there have been more than fifty opportunities to admire her work. Little by little, her singular style, easy to recognize even though her work was always evolving, took shape. With remarkable imagination, she filled her works with legendary and fantastic characters, amazing oneiric landscapes and, as if in a guide to the interpretation of dreams, the titles she presented to the public that were both enigmatic and enlightening, as of an invitation to try to decipher this personal and magical world. In her iconographic repertoire we find angels, children, magical animals, princesses, legendary monsters, inhabitants of impossible landscapes and structures that transport us to our childhood memories and joyful dreams. But we also find fighting feminists, rejected princes, caryatids tired of being so, and dying stars, conveying messages that, without affecting the gentleness of her style, can still be critical and forceful. Biography Josefa S√°nchez D√≠az, was born in Seville on 4 April 1929, second daughter of Ana Mar√≠a D√≠az and Jos√© S√°nchez. She had an elder sister, Lola. Her father died from peritonitis when Pepi was only two years old. As a result, the young widow moved with her daughters to the house of her sister Concha, who was twenty years her elder and married to an Italian, Ernesto de Micheli Rivaro, employed at the Italian Consulate. This childless couple \\"adopted\\" these two girls, involving themselves completely in their education. Uncle Micheli took the role of the father figure, while the two sisters, the cheerful Ana Maria and the more serious and formal Concha, shared the role of mother. With a strict old fashioned view on education, this Italian from the outskirts of Milan was contrary to the idea of the girls going to school, preferring to provide them with private education. Consequently, he hired a teacher to come home every day. This childhood with little contact with other children led Pepi not to savour her infancy and left her wishing to prolong it. Uncle Micheli was a strong influence in the artistic development of the two sisters. He was an expert and a great admirer of Italian art, and he helped them appreciate and love it from an early age. As a result, both sisters decided they wanted to become painters. At the young age of 9 and 12, Pepi and Loli entered Jose Maria Labrador's studio, a Cordovan painter settled in Seville, A few years later the two sisters joined the Santa Isabel de Hungria School of Fine Arts in Seville. Pepi was only 12, so she needed a special permit from the Ministry of Education to join the school. Soon she started standing out and earned State Awards in all her courses. Her two trips to Italy in 1952 and 1955 were important in developing Pepi's style. Directly seeing Giotto, Mantegna, Paolo Ucello, Piero Della Francesca frescoes and all the Italian art that she had admired for years through books and photographs, left an indelible imprint. Open to everything that meant renovation and modernity, after finishing her training, she broke with the official academic-ism and joined an avant-garde group called \\"Young Sevillian School of Painting and Sculpture\\". As we can see from her Curriculum Vitae, Pepi's paintings, ceramics and mosaics were to be admired in many exhibitions. In 1958 she married the Sevillian writer, Manuel Garcia Vi√±o, and in a search for a more modern environment, they moved to Madrid. They stayed some time with Rafael Montesinos, a Sevillian poet, and his wife Marisa, until they received the keys to their new home. The children followed soon: Monica (1959), Patricia (1960), Manolo (1962), Pablo (1964) and Chema (1966). Being the mother of a large family with all the responsibilities and work entailed, did not stop her from devoting herself to her art with courageous perseverance. There was a clear change in her iconography after she became a mother. As from 1959 her world became more personal That was the time when her world became the fantasy of princes, wizards and legendary characters, taking on those poetic and suggestive titles. It was also during those first years of motherhood that she started a busy career as an illustrator. She would become a frequent collaborator for \\"La Estafeta Literaria\\", among others, and in 1966 she illustrated \\"Historia y Antolog√≠a de la Literatura Infantil Iberoamericana\\" by Carmen Bravo Villasante, Doncel publishing house. In 1965, while playing with the children, she discovered stones as a support for her magical characters. At first, she used rounded stones from the river beds. Later, as her compositions became more baroque, she made use of lime stones with complex forms and grooves, found in the province of Guadalajara. Her singular imaginative world has been a source of inspiration to her husband and many other poets and writers, who have written about her and her art: Manuel Alc√°ntara, Montserrat del Amo, Marcelo Arroita- J√°uregui, Alfonso Canales, Antonio Enrique, Francisco Garfias, Antonio Hern√°ndez, Luis Jim√©nez Martos, Antonio Leyva, Manuel Mantero, Joaqu√≠n M√°rquez, Rafael Montesinos, Rafael Morales, Federico Muelas, Digna Palou, Fernando Qui√±ones, Jos√© Mar√≠a Requena, Mariano Rold√°n and L√°zaro Santana are among them. In 1984 she and the politician and art collector, Agustin Rodriguez Sahagun, signed an exclusivity contract, which his heirs took through to 2002. An indefatigable worker, she continued painting until a few days before she died on 5 March 2012 in Madrid.

Thomas Borer (born 1957) is a former ambassador of Switzerland. He had a role in resolving the problems created by Swiss banking secrecy laws in protecting the Nazi seizure of Jewish assets during the Holocaust, and in the use of Swiss banks as a medium for tax evasion.  Biography  Thomas Borer was born in 1957 and studied law at the University of Basel where he obtained his doctorate summa cum laude in 1985. His thesis focused on the principle of legality and foreign affairs.  Career  In 1987, Borer joined the Swiss Department of Foreign Affairs (EDA) as a diplomat. He was posted to Bern (Department for International Law, 1987 and 1989‚Äì93), Lagos (1987/88) and Geneva (1988/89). In 1993, he was appointed Embassy Secretary for Legal and Political Affairs at the Swiss Embassy in Washington, USA. On 21 December 1994, he was appointed Deputy General Secretary of the EDA by the Swiss Federal Council. In this role, he led the personnel, technology, logistics, finance and administrative law departments. In addition, he was responsible for the reorganisation of the EDA and the Swiss Representative Network Abroad. On 25 October 1996 the Swiss Federal Council appointed him Ambassador and Head of the ‚ÄúSwitzerland ‚Äì Second World War‚Äù Task Force, which examined the role of Switzerland as a financial centre during the Nazi era. The Task Force contributed substantially to settle a lawsuit filed by the World Jewish Congress against Swiss banks in 1995. As a consequence on August 12, 1998, the Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse reached an agreement with the World Jewish Congress and agreed to pay $1.25 billion to victims of the holocaust or their heirs. Borer gained international recognition for his commitment in this process. In 2010 he stepped down and since works as a strategic advisor in politics and economy on behalf of companies and individuals. On 31 March 1999, the Swiss Federal Council named Borer as Swiss Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany. At the end of April 2002, he left public service and returned to Switzerland. Shortly after he became strategic consultant for Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, and in 2005 a member of the Board of Directors of Renova Group, Viktor Vekselberg‚Äôs company. He stepped down in 2010 and has since been working as a strategic advisor for different private and public companies. In the German and international news media, Borer is a popular speaker and commentator on economic issues and on Swiss-German relations, particularly on Switzerland as a financial center and on the banking secrecy.
