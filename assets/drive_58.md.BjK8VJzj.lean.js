Being a cosmopolitan city, the culture of the city reflects its diverse population which has resulted in a unique blend. Though it is generally considered a traditional city, Coimbatore is more diverse and cosmopolitan than other cities in Tamil Nadu. Traditional music, dance and all other art forms of Tamil Nadu are very popular in the city. One can find a unique blend of culture from traditional foods to fast foods, from ancient temple architecture to modern high-rises and from classical music and dance to the growing nightlife in the city. Coimbatore and its people have a reputation for entrepreneurship. Music and arts The city conducts its own music festival every year. Art, dance and music concerts are held annually during the months of September and December (Tamil calendar month ‚Äì Margazhi). The heavy industrialisation of the city has also resulted in the growth of trade unions. People The city's population is predominantly Hindu, along with a small group of Muslim population. Christians, Sikhs and Jains are also present in small numbers. Coimbatore also has a large number of Telugus,The 1971 census puts Telugu speakers at 22.95% of the total population. Kannadigas , Malayalis,Some estimates put it as high as 40% or at 300,000. mainly from Palakkad and North Indians, mainly Gujaratis, who are engaged in trade and commerce. During the 1970s the city witnessed a population explosion as a result of migration fuelled by increased economic growth and job opportunities.\\"There are 195 slums in 23 major identified locations inside the corporation limits with a total population of around 352,219, which include BPL population as well. (2005 figures) page.86 Religion There are numerous temples in and around the city including the Perur Patteeswarar Temple, Konniamman temple, Thandu Mariamman temple, Vazhai Thottathu Ayyan temple, ISKCON Temple, Eachanari Vinayagar Temple, Karamadai temple, Marudamalai Murugan temple, Loga Nayaga Shani Eswaran shrine, Astamsa Varada Anjaneyar temple, Panchamuga Anjaneya temple and Dhyanalinga Yogic Temple. The Mariamman festivals, at the city's numerous Amman temples, are major events in summer. The mosques on Oppanakara Street and Big Bazaar Street date back to the period of Hyder Ali. Christian missions date back to 1647 when permission was granted by the Nayak rulers to set up a small church in Karumathampatti . It was destroyed by Tipu Sultan's army resulting in a new church in 1804. In 1886, Coimbatore was constituted as a diocese after bifurcating with Puducherry. Sikh Gurudwaras and Jain Temples are also present in Coimbatore.The Puliyakulam Vinayagar temple stands with the biggest lord Ganesha's statue in Asia.

However, the population of Coimbatore is multi-cultural due to the influx of migrant population from various regions of the country. Most locals still retain their rural flavour, with many restaurants serving food over a banana leaf. North Indian, Chinese and continental cuisines are also available. Mysore pak (a sweet made from lentil flour and ghee), idly, dosa, Halwa (a sweet made of different ingredients like milk, wheat, rice). The Annapoorna Gowrishankar Hotels is a gem of this region known for its high quality vegetarian food and their Sambar ( The sambar for all its branches around Coimbatore are prepared in a single large batch and then delivered to the branches, thus the taste remains consistent). Biryani is also popular among the locals. Apart from this Coimbatore has a very active street food culture, thanks to the migratory North Indian population that settled down here a few generation ago, in fact a streetfood that is popular all over Tamil Nadu The Kaazhaan has its origins here in Coimbatore, it is usually prepared by simmering deep fried mushrooms( usually chopped mushroom) in a spicy broth, until it reaches a porridge like consistency and served sprinkled with chopped onions and coriander leaves. Language Kongu Tamil is the dialect of Tamil language that is spoken majorly in the city. It is originally known as \\"Kangee\\"\` \\"In the southern part of Mysore the Tamil language is at this day named the Kangee, from being best known to them as the language of the people of Kangiam\\". Cf. Wilks: Mysore 1, 4n. 55. or \\"Kongalam\\" or 'Gounder Bashai' or \\"Kongappechu\\" or 'Kongu Bashai'. The speciality of Kongu Tamil is the use of the alveolar ‡Æ± - Tra/Dra (as in the English word track) instead of retroflex T/D (‡Æü) of standard Tamil. For example, 'ennuDaya' (mine) of standard Tamil is pronounced enRa in the Kongu dialect. Additionally the use of guttural nasal (‡Æô‡Øç) that sounds \\"ng\\" as in the English word Gang, is more prevalent in Kongu Tamil, leading to situations where the grammar of Kongu Tamil would not fit into the grammar of standard Tamil (as laid down in authoritative treatises like Tolkappiyam and Nannool). One of the examples is the use of ‡Æô‡Øç to end a word like ‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æô‡Øç \\"vaang\\", means 'come' expressed in a respectful tone, which in standard Tamil would be \\"vaanga\\". English is increasingly spoken by the educated class and other languages spoken in the city include Malayalam, Kannada, Telugu and Urdu. Pongal, the major festival in the region Festivals Coimbatore celebrates many festivals including local temple festivals. Thai Pongal, celebrated in the month of January, is the most important festival of and is celebrated over a period of five days. Pongal has been designated the \\"State Festival\\" for its unique celebration that is typical of Tamil Nadu. Tamil New Year signifying the beginning of the Tamil calendar usually falls in April and is celebrated widely with special poojas in temples. Being a cosmopolitan city, almost all major festivals like Deepavali, Eid and Christmas are celebrated here. Onam is also celebrated with much fanfare due to the large Malayali immigrant population.

It carries a local dirt road across Josiah Creek in the Allen's Mills section of Industry, and is located near (and possibly on) the border with neighboring Somerset County. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. The bridge abutments consist of local fieldstone arranged in dry laid courses. The main span consists of large granite slabs laid across the narrow opening between the abutments. A layer of earth is built above these slabs, supporting the dirt roadway, which is about wide. The southern abutment has extensive wingwalls, giving that structure a total width of about . The road which the bridge carries was probably laid out in 1808, during the early period of Industry's settlement. John Thompson had a house and established a grist mill nearby in 1805. The area had been abandoned by the late 19th century, and the roadway south of the bridge is unmaintained and in deteriorated condition. In a 1924 survey, the state identified more than 100 of this type of bridge; as of 1987, only three were known to survive in relatively unaltered condition. The bridge is also one of the town of Industry's oldest structures; its oldest surviving building has an estimated construction date of 1820.

History and description The first cathedral of Matelica was built in the historical centre of the town, but fell into ruin after the bishop's seat was moved elsewhere, and was finally demolished in 1530. It had already been replaced as the town's main church in the 15th century by the church of Santa Maria della Piazza, which was made the cathedral under the name of Santa Maria Assunta in 1785 when Matelica was restored as a bishopric. The campanile, which dates from the 15th century, is most unusually positioned in the centre of the cathedral's west front. This has sometimes led to suppositions over whether the present church building occupies the same position as the original church or whether repeated re-buildings and restorations over time have had the effect of moving it.

Composition Page from a manuscript of the Summa (MS. Tanner 335, Bodleyan Library, Oxford ) showing the initial Q with a dragon. Penyafort's work relied heavily on Gratian's Decretum Gratiani. In it Penyafort put forth the argument that acting in defense of yourself or your property could only occur when an attack was already under way and you were repelling it, or if an attack was imminent. Accordingly, Penyafort put defending yourself and offensive actions in juxtaposition, as defense concerned the immediate future and the present, and offense was an act of vengeance for actions which had already been committed.

The Draco (considered an epic by some critics, such as Irene Harris and Elizabeth Kuhl) was based largely on the work of Robert of Torigni and William of Jumi√®ges Gesta Normannorum Ducum. The poem itself is unfinished, and also adapts parts of the Roman de Brut by Wace. Considered Stephen's principal work it survives in the Vatican Library. In the manuscript the poem runs to nearly 4,400 lines, though it has lost at least two passages, estimated at around one hundred verses each. The manuscript was initially anonymous, however it has been accepted for over one hundred years that Stephen is the undisputed author. The conventional modern form of the title, Draco Normannicus, was chosen by Richard Howlett in his edition published in 1885. In the manuscript it occurs only in a different word order, as Normannicus Draco. Howlett also translated the title as \\"the Norman Standard\\", rather than literally as \\"Norman Dragon\\", as the Draco is named for the dragon shaped banners which the Normans followed into battle. It is a chronicle of the Normans' history, from their arrival in the former kingdom of Neustria, and the founding of Normandy up to the events which occurred during Stephen's life. There is an emphasis on the territorial conflicts which occurred between Henry II and Louis VII.  Historical characters mentioned  Matilda of England, daughter to King Henry I of England, later to become the Empress Matilda after her marriage to Henry V, becomes a central point during the narrative, as well as Stephen's vision of the dynasty and historical identity of the Norman people. The work gives a detailed account on the funeral rites of Matilda, carried out by the archbishop of Rouen, Rotrou. In the poem, Stephen names Morgan Le Fay definitively as the sister of Arthur, and ruler of the isle of Avalon. He also makes mention that Morgan is immortal, and has the ability to grant immortality to Arthur with the aid of the herbs found on the isle. In previous epics Morgan had not been named as sister to Arthur. Only in Chr√©tien de Troyes poem Erec and Enide was Morgan transformed from sorceress to sister, and this innovation was followed by Stephen in the Draco.  Analysis According to Martin Aurell, Stephen is the only author of the Arthurian legends known to have had a direct relationship with Henry II. Aurell believes that Stephen, growing up at a time when the Normans were committed to gaining independence from France, was completely devoted to the cause of Henry II and that this ideology is clearly visible in the Draco. Aurell states the poem has \\"the character of a piece of propaganda totally committed to the cause of Henry II\\" and that it includes a \\"violent diatribe against Thomas Becket\\", which Stephen wrote shortly before Becket was murdered in Canterbury Cathedral. There are extensive passages devoted to the funeral rites of Matilda, who lived out her last twenty years at the priory Notre Dame du Pr√©, on the outskirts of Rouen. Elizabeth Kuhl believes that as there are only one extant copy of the work remaining, it shows that the poem received little interest at the time it was written. However she states that assumptions on the meanings of how writing on historical matters should be presented led to the Draco being evaluated negatively, but in more recent times it is now accepted that \\"all historical writing arranges and makes sense out of its past and present in ways that are not inherent to events themselves\\". Initially, the Draco received no attention from scholars since, under the assumptions of how history ought to be written, it was deemed a failure, but when viewed from the latter perspective it is, according to Kuhl, an excellent example. Kuhl also states that another copy, which has since been lost was known to have been made. Footnotes  References   External links  * Stephen of Rouen: \\"Draco Normannicus\\". Ed. Richard Howlett.

She was a pupil of Jean- Charles Cazin (1840-1901). She painted in oils and pastels, landscapes especially, of which she exhibited seventeen in June, 1902. The larger part of these were landscape portraits. The subjects were well represented, and the various hours of day, with characteristic lighting, unusually well rendered. At the Salon des Beaux Arts, 1902, this artist exhibited a large pastel, \\"A Halt at St. Mammes\\" and a \\"Souvenir of Bormes\\", showing the tomb of Cazin. In 1903, she exhibited a pastel called \\"Calvary,\\" which became part of the collection of the Mus√©e de Picardie at Amiens; it was praised for its harmony of color and the manner in which the rainbow is represented.

Bromelain is approved in Europe for the debridement (removal of eschar, that is dead and damaged tissue) of severe burn wounds under the trade name NexoBrid. In the US, it has completed Phase III clinical trials and has the tentative trade name Debrase. It was developed by MediWound, Germany; and Teva is responsible for development and marketing in the US. The medicine has been granted orphan drug status by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In other contexts, bromelain has been researched for possible anti-inflammatory effects in treating a range of conditions or diseases, but results of these studies are mixed and regarded as preliminary. Medical uses The medication is approved for burns of degrees IIb, i.e. deep partial skin thickness burns, to III, i.e. full thickness burns, and has been shown to significantly reduce the necessity of surgical debridement (15% versus 63% under standard treatment) and skin transplants (18% versus 34%) in a randomized controlled trial. The concentrate is solved in a sterile gel basis, applied onto the burn wound, covered with a wound dressing, and removed after four hours. The healthy surrounding skin has to be protected with a sterile paraffin ointment. The EMA recommends that the treatment should be used in only hospitals having specialised burns centres. Contraindications and adverse effects Predictably, the bromelain gel is contraindicated in persons allergic to pineapple or the enzyme papain. The most common side-effects are fever (19% of patients in studies) and local pain (3.6%). Wound infections occur no more frequently than under standard treatment.  Interactions  The enzymes in NexoBrid inhibit the liver enzymes CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 when ingested. These are involved in the breaking down of a number of drugs, including amiodarone, chloroquine, ibuprofen, and warfarin. It is not known whether this mechanism has any clinical relevance. Pharmacokinetics Depending on the surface area and depth of the wound, bromelain blood serum concentrations of no more than 40 ¬µg/ml are expected, with peak concentrations reached after 2 to 4 hours. The terminal half-life varied between 8.5 and 19.9 hours in studies. These data have been obtained from 15 patients with comparatively shallow wounds. Chemistry The medication is extracted from the stem of the pineapple plant (Ananas comosus) by a standardised process, and each lot has to be analysed for its chemical composition. It contains a mixture of proteolytic enzymes, the main compound being stem bromelain. Bromelain is thought to be the active ingredient, but this has not been determined in studies. The gel basis contains water, polyacrylic acid as a gelling agent, and a disodium hydrogen phosphate/sodium hydroxide buffer.

Built in 1871-76, Rural Hall has been the principal social meeting point for the small rural community of East Surry. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004 for its importance in the social history of the community. Description and history Rural Hall is set facing south on the south side of Surry Road, about east of the village center of Surry. It is a long rectangular wood frame structure, with a front-gable roof, clapboard siding, and a stone foundation. It is set facing away from the road because the road alignment at the time of its construction 1871-76 was to the south. Its main facade is three bays wide, with a central entrance sheltered by an enclosed vestibuled under a hip roof. The entry is flanked by paired narrow sash windows, a form repeated above the entrance in the gable end. Similar window pairs line the sides of the building. The rear, which now faces the road, has no windows and a single doorway sheltered by a bracketed gable-roof hood. The interior of the building, beyond the vestibule, is an open auditorium, with portable wooden benches and a raised stage at the north end. A balcony, probably added late in the 19th century, extends across the southern end of the hall. Part of the balcony is taken up by a small kitchen area, added in the 1940s, from which food can be delivered to the lower level via a dumbwaiter. An area under the balcony has been enclosed for use as a bathroom. The building retains its original heating system‚Äîa wood stove with a long chimney pipe. Construction of the Rural Hall had its genesis in the 1868 meeting of a local sewing circle, at which it was decided to raise funds for construction of a community hall. The Rural Hall Association was formed in 1870, and funds raised by subscription. The building's construction between 1871 and 1876 was chronicled by the local historian, who also donated the land on which it was built. The hall has been used since its construction by a wide variety of local social groups.

He played college basketball for the Yale Bulldogs. He was named Ivy League Player of the Year twice, in 2015 and 2016.  Early life  Justin was born to Ryan and Lorna Sears and brought up in Plainfield, New Jersey. He and his younger brother, Jordan, began playing tennis at age four, and his experience with the sport helped his footwork. Jordan started playing basketball in sixth grade, and Justin began playing for fun with the Catholic Youth Organization (CYO) at around the same time. Justin competed at a higher level in eighth grade, after his father's friend encouraged him to play in a league in Plainfield. The Sears brothers later competed for both the basketball and tennis teams at Plainfield High School. Their wingspans helped them excel as a doubles tennis team. Even though he played sports for Plainfield, Justin officially attended the Academy for Information Technology in Scotch Plains, New Jersey, who did not have any sports teams. The academy was a branch of Union County Vocational Technical Schools.  High school career  As a basketball player at Plainfield High School, Sears finished with historical numbers of 1,048 points and 1,063 rebounds. He became the second player in school history to record over 1,000 in each category. In his sophomore season, Sears helped Plainfield make a postseason run, and in turn, drew the attention of colleges. As his junior season came to a close, he began receiving offers from NCAA Division I schools. As a senior, Sears averaged 13.4 points, 12.0 rebounds and 3.2 blocks, and he garnered first team all-state, all-area and all-county accolades. During his time with Plainfield, he led his team to two New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA) Group III titles. He also appeared in the NJSIAA Tournament of Champions championship game two times, losing to St. Anthony High School on both occasions. College career On October 29, 2011, Sears committed to play college basketball at Yale University with the Bulldogs. He commented, \\"Four years ago if you told me I was going to Yale, I would have started laughing at you. But looking at it now, it's a great opportunity that's been given to me.\\" While at Yale, he was named Ivy League Player of the Year twice (2015, 2016). During his senior year he led the Bulldogs to their first NCAA Tournament in 54 years. During the Tournament, he helped lead the to Bulldogs to an upset victory over Baylor in the first round before falling to Duke in the second round. Professional career Sears signed with Gie√üen 46ers in June 2016. On July 12, 2017, Sears signed with MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg of the German Basketball Bundesliga for the 2017‚Äì18 season. On November 28, 2018 Sears signed with EWE Baskets Oldenburg. He averaged 5.9 points and 3.1 rebounds per game during the 2019-20 season. On July 26, 2020, Sears parted ways with the team. On August 14, 2020, Sears signed with s.Oliver W√ºrzburg.  Personal life  Sears attended high school at The Academy For Information Technology in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. With the Plainfield High School basketball team, he was known to read books and do his homework in the locker room. He often prioritized his academics over his athletics, despite receiving offers from several NCAA Division I colleges. While finding a college, Sears tried to find a school that stood out both academically and in its athletics programs, with a professional basketball career being uncertain. In order for Justin to attend Yale University, the Sears family had to pay about $54,000 per year. At Yale, Sears has taken environmental politics and law classes. As of March 2016, his major is undeclared, although he has previously shown interest in economics.

She founded the feminist journal La Fran√ßaise (The Frenchwoman), published from 1906 to 1934, and was a member of the executive of the French Union for Women's Suffrage and the National Council of French Women. Early years Jane Misme was born in 1865. In January 1893 Jeanne Schmahl founded the Avant-Courri√®re (Forerunner) association, which called for the right of women to be witnesses in public and private acts, and for the right of married women to take the product of their labor and dispose of it freely. The campaign aimed to mobilize middle- and upper-class women who had moderate and conservative views. Anne de Rochechouart de Mortemart (1847‚Äì1933), Duchess of Uz√®s and Juliette Adam (1836‚Äì1936) soon joined the Avant-Courri√®re, and Schmahl found support from Jane Misme and Jeanne Chauvin (1862‚Äì1926), the first woman to become a doctor of law. Journalist Jane Misme became a journalist when she was about thirty years old, writing from 1896 to 1906 in newspapers such as Le Figaro, Le Matin and the Revue de Paris. Her articles covered subjects such as the social roles of women in the past, and the new careers open to women. She was also drama critic for La Fronde and L'Action from 1899 to 1905. La Fronde had been founded by the actress and suffragist Marguerite Durand in 1897. In October 1901 Misme wrote in an article on \\"the conception of women in French theater\\" for La Fronde, La Fran√ßaise 1906 poster by Alice Kaub-Casalonga (1875-1948) La Fronde ceased publication in March 1905. Misme launched La Fran√ßaise (The Frenchwoman) the next year, to fill the gap. It was a four- page, large format weekly that first appeared on 21 October 1906. Cofounders included Mathilde Meliot, director if the Monde Financier, and Marguerite Durand. Germaine Dulac was a regular contributor, writing literary portraits between 1906 and 1908, and theatrical criticism from 1908 to 1913. The paper was owned by the writers through a cooperative. This parent organization, the Cercle de La Fran√ßaise, was described as a \\"home of practical and moral action for all feminine interests.\\" Unlike La Fronde, Misme accepted men as collaborators, but refused to argue over politics or religion. The focus would be on \\"the situation and role of women in France and abroad.\\" In 1908 Misme wrote that La Francaise was strongly against \\"violent public demonstrations\\" which were \\"essentially incompatible with French style [go√ªt]\\". La Fran√ßaise was intended to take a broad position linking the different republican feminist movements. In practice it became the official organ of the moderate National Council of French Women (CNFF: French: Conseil National des femmes fran√ßaises), to which many women's associations belonged. The CNFF had been formally launched on 18 April 1901. The initial committee was headed by Isabelle Bogelot and included Sarah Monod, Avril de Sainte-Croix, Julie Siegfried and Marie Bonnevial. Misme was president of the Press, Letters and Arts section of the CNFF and delegate to the presidency of the Press, Letters and Arts section of the International Council of Women. French Union for Women's Suffrage The French Union for Women's Suffrage (UFSF) was founded by a group of feminists who had attended a national congress of French feminists in Paris in 1908. Most of them were from bourgeois or intellectual backgrounds. The leaders were Jeanne Schmahl and Jane Misme. The founding meeting of 300 women was held in February 1909. C√©cile Brunschvicg (1877‚Äì1946) was made secretary-general. Schmahl was the first president. Misme was vice- president of the UFSF from 1909 to 1935. Schmahl resigned from the UFSF in 1911 due to disputes with C√©cile Brunschvicg, although the reason given was health problems. Jane Misme stayed with the UFSF, which had 12,000 members by 1914. World War I During World War I (1914‚Äì18) the motto on the banner of La Fran√ßaise read \\"Frenchwomen during the war. What they do. What we can do for them.\\" After the outbreak of war Misme wrote in La Fran√ßaise, \\"As long as the adversity of our country endures, nobody is entitled to speak of their rights; we only have responsibilities to it.\\" Setting aside international women's solidarity, she also wrote, \\"As long as the war continues, the wives of the enemy will also be the enemy.\\" In a 1914 article Misme criticized Red Cross nurses who did not show the selfless devotion to duty the Republic required, but might be attracted by the glamor of the uniform or the potential the job offered to find a husband. She thought these women were harming the suffrage cause, since women's valiant effort during the war would be used to justify giving the vote to women after the war had ended. From 1915 Misme contributed to L'Oeuvre and Minerva. The loss of French men during the war, or their absence in the trenches, created a drop in the birth rate and a shortage of husbands. Proposals for countering the problem included polygamy and pregnancy outside of marriage. Misme thought this was barbarous. A woman who was denied love and motherhood should be seen as a victim of war, and their sacrifice should bring honor, not disgrace. La Fran√ßaise said unwed motherhood was \\"degrading for women, humiliating for men ... noxious for the child ... dangerous for the public order and intimate happiness.\\" One of the issues discussed in La Fran√ßaise was the question of pregnancies due to rape by German soldiers. Misme was personally opposed to abortion, but urged her readers to use her correspondence page to debate the issues, and published a wide range of views from both men and women. She rejected the concept that the woman was a \\"shamed\\" victim, and called on women to bear and love their children. Misme held the maternalist view that mothers and children always deserved help and respect. She wrote, \\"It is with all the strength of my maternal instinct that I speak to defend, here and everywhere, the mothers and children who are treated as outcasts.\\" If a mother abandoned the child from a wartime rape, the child was officially entitled to foster care in the normal way. Misme questioned how the foster parents would treat them if they suspected their origin. Misme published letters that insulted her, accused her of siding with the Germans and even called her a German spy. Misme wrote an extensive article on La Guerre et le r√¥le des femmes in the November 1916 issue of La Revue de Paris. She noted that the French feminist societies had suspended their pacifist activities. French women had shown by their deeds that they should be treated as socially equal to men. They had taken the place of men in the factories, had taken the place of husbands and fathers in the family, and had become farmers, laborers, veterinaries, notaries, barbers and merchants of all kinds. They had filled vacant positions in schools and local administration. Before the war the feminist leaders had been treated with hostility, but now the mood had changed. Misme called for reforms in education, labor problems, marriage, charity, hygiene, social morality and politics that would demonstrate that sexual equality is triumphantly possible. Post-war period Misme continued as an active and opinionated journalist after the war. Writing in L'Oeuvre in a 1919 editorial Misme dismissed the many \\"lamentations\\" she had heard about newly independent women who chose not to marry in the postwar period. She wrote, \\"Ah! The time is past when you married the first well-groomed dog that came along just to be called Madame, wear diamonds, go out alone, and in particular guarantee your daily bread. She thought that the war had accelerated a change that was already happening in the way single women were viewed. Writing in La Francaise in 1922 Misme praised the new, shorter swimsuits for allowing young women more freedom of movement in the water. She wrote, \\"anything that stands in the way of the harmonious and necessary development of the body can only be a false kind of grace and modesty.\\" In an article titled Les Provocatrices (Oeuvre, 8 November 1923) Misme claimed that the courtship relationship had changed. Instead of passively waiting to be asked for marriage, women were taking a more active role. In discussing controversy over an article on \\"Do Frenchwomen have to marry strangers\\" she wrote, \\"They do not have to; they can; that is very different.\\" In Maternit√©: Le plus beau sport (Oeuvre, 29 November 1923) Misme objected to the spread of the ideas of Sigmund Freud in France, saying his theories were very controversial, and were largely in vogue due to fashion. Under the Law of 10 August 1927 French women married to non-naturalized foreigners could retain their citizenship, their children were considered French and their husbands could now become eligible for citizenship in three years rather than ten. Odette Simon of the UFSF noted that \\"the essential goal of this law is to increase as much as possible the number of French men and women.\\" However, Misme praised the law as an attack on the concept of \\"marital supremacy,\\" where a woman was subordinate to her husband, and thus another step in the process of reform that had started with the married women's property law of 1907. By 1926 La Fran√ßaise had been transferred from the CNFF to the affiliated French Union for Women's Suffrage (UFSF: Union fran√ßaise pour le suffrage des femmes). Misme often published short biographies of suffragists in La Francaise and Minerva, creating a useful resource for historians of the women's movement in France. She wrote a series of articles on \\"The Great Figures of Feminism\\" for Minerva. An article published on 30 November 1930 described the achievements of Avril de Sainte-Croix, who was 75 years old, but despite illness and fragility was \\"a permanent miracle of vitality and energy.\\" She said Sainte-Croix had been born to lead, was the undisputed leader of French feminism and one of the leaders of international feminism. Jane Misme died in 1935.

The game features original characters and stories interacting with characters, scenarios, and battles from other games in the Final Fantasy series. It was released in Japan on September 24, 2014, and worldwide on March 26, 2015. The gameplay largely consists of Active Time Battles with 2D sprite graphics. It has reached over 10 million downloads worldwide and is available in Japanese, English, French and Spanish.  Gameplay  Players enter each Final Fantasy titles world and fights to clear dungeons. As they accomplish this, they unlock new characters from those games. Players can combine parties of characters from different Final Fantasy titles. However, though using a game mechanic called \\"Synergy System\\", playing the characters that are originally from the world you are in gives characters a \\"stat bonus\\". This also applies to weapons and gear. The game has players reenact many moments from the Final Fantasy series, such as the Battle on the Big Bridge against Gilgamesh. Characters can be given weapons or abilities that are collected along the way. The game is free-to-play, but does have microtransactions. Plot Players control Deci, a researcher who works in the history department for Dr. Mog. Being his best student, Dr. Mog shares his magic so that Deci can enter paintings and see memories of different worlds, which are previous Final Fantasy titles.  Development  Developer DeNA proposed doing a social role-playing game to Square Enix that would center around the Final Fantasy series, similar to a title the developer had worked on previously called Defender of Texel. That game used pixel graphics and characters battling in formation. Square Enix producer Ichiro Hazama decided that DeNA had the experience to build a successful mobile game for western markets and gave the game approval to be developed. Square Enix oversaw the game, as well as the story, setting, and characters, but the backend publishing was left to DeNA. DeNa producer Yu Sasaki stated that international release was expected to happen upon initial launch of the game, but was delayed and released after modifications were made to please western audiences. For the international release of the game, artwork from any remakes that had been done of earlier Final Fantasy games were used, as developers felt that American audiences connected more to later Final Fantasy games than earlier ones. Cutscenes were looked at again and polished for the same reason. The game was designed to not be difficult, and character profiles were also added for international release so new players could easily start enjoying the game. Tetsuya Nomura designed player character Tyro, as well as supporting cast members Dr. Mog, Cid, and Elarra. To draw in American audiences, the first world entered in the game is from Final Fantasy VII, and the next two are fan favorites in Japan: Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy VI. When events are run, the characters involved are chosen by player popularity. Characters are not added from games if there are not yet enough worlds or events from those same games. The game's producers felt that characters should be winnable through battle, and the game's currency of mithril given generously to encourage players to keep playing. Enemy bosses are animated, in a departure from the style of the older titles that are being referenced. Activities such as logging in to the game earn players in-game currency, and more free ways of obtaining currency were added for the international release. Western and Japanese versions of the game are run on different servers, so no player communication is possible between the two versions. Producer Ichiro Hazama stated that the core of the experience of the game is ‚Äúreliving the past‚Äù. Hazama also felt there was room for original story expansion in the game's plot and in the new main character Tyro. On July 15, 2014, a teaser site appeared with a timer counting time for the game's actual reveal.  Reception  IGN praised the game's use of nostalgia for previous Final Fantasy games and fun combat and customization. However, they criticized its lack of character interaction and shallow story, which made it hard for the game to hold players' interest. Kotaku voiced a similar sentiment, calling the game a \\"fun time waster\\", but noting the presence of the \\"much loathed stamina scheme\\" used to entice players to pay for more play time. VentureBeat said that the crafting and combining of items and weapons was \\"actually fun\\", and felt like a real Final Fantasy game, but condemned the gameplay as being boring because it is mostly a \\"hands-off\\" experience. Within ten days of release, the game was downloaded over one million times. After a month, the game recorded three million downloads and one billion yen. The game reached five million downloads in six months in Japan, and was in the top five highest grossing games in the Apple App Store.

He was also the bassist for Seasons in the Field and current bassist for Lonely//Ghost//Parade. Weyandt is also a tattooer and owns a shop in his hometown, Greensburg, Pennsylvania.  History  Seasons in the Field (1996‚Äì1998) According to Zao's DVD, The Lesser Lights of Heaven, Weyandt started his music career with the band Seasons in the Field with friends Guitarist Russ Cogdell, Drummer Bob Bigelow, and Vocalist Jason Keener. They were originally named Sower. After a while Bigelow left and was replaced by Stephen Peck. They recorded their split album, Psalms of Ariana with Pensive. Their song, \\"Eternity\\" on the compilation album Blessed be the Killing from Deadself Records. In 1998, Seasons in the Field disbanded, and Weyandt and Cogdell joined Zao.

They recorded their Zao debut, and Solid State Records debut, Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest. In 1998, Zao recorded the Training for Utopia / Zao split EP with Training for Utopia. After recording the EP, Detar left, and was replaced by Scott Mellinger (formerly of Creation Is Crucifixion). Bassist Rob Horner joined soon after and they recorded Liberate Te Ex Inferis. In 2000, Cogdell left for a time and the band recorded Self-Titled. Zao \\"broke-up\\" in 2001, but later in 2002 they re-formed and recorded Parade of Chaos. In 2004, Cogdell re-joined and they started to write new music, when Jesse Smith and Rob Horner left. Former Seasons in the Field member, Stephen Peck, along with bassist Shawn Koschick joined Zao and the band recorded The Funeral of God. After this Peck and Koschick left the band and were replaced by Ex-Pensive member Martin Lunn and Jeff Gretz of From Autumn to Ashes. On the \\"Under the Gun Tour\\" in 2006, Weyandt broke four bones in his left hand. The band had to drop off the tour, due to his injuries. This line-up recorded The Fear Is What Keeps Us Here and Awake?. After Awake? the band went on five-year unofficial hiatus. They have recently resurfaced and have two releases coming soon.

The song \\"Scars that Don't Speak\\" deals with an ex-girlfriend of Weyandt's being assaulted by a youth pastor. Songs off the upcoming album, The Well Intentioned Virus, deal with the miscarriage of Weyandt's child, fever dreams of Weyandt's personal experience, and a broken suicide pact. Religion Weyandt was an outspoken Christian, but in a later interview it was stated that the only Zao member with Christian beliefs was bassist Martin Lunn. It is unknown what he believes or does not believe currently.

The center was established in 2012 by Nora Belahcen Fitzgerald. Each year 30‚Äì40 women complete four to six months of training, which often leads to them finding employment in a relevant field.  History  Entrance to Amal Women's Training Center and Moroccan Restaurant Nora Belahcen Fitzgerald first conceived of the idea of creating an organization to help Morocco's underprivileged women through career training in 2006 after meeting a single mother begging on the street who lived on 2030 dirhams per day (about ‚Ç¨2.70, $3.40 in 2006). Belahcen Fitzgerald was inspired by the Association Solidarit√© F√©minine, which helps single mothers overcome poverty and social stigma by providing them with shelter, counselling, and vocational training. She decided to begin helping women by teaching them to make baked goods in her family's language center. This proved to be successful, and the participants were able to make more money using their new skills than by begging. In 2008, Belahcen Fitzgerald began hiring underprivileged Moroccan women to cook for events she organized for her friends. In 2012 Belahcen Fitzgerald found a property to rent and registered Amal Women's Training Center and Moroccan Restaurant as a non-profit organization. In early 2013 the center raised more than $7300 through crowdfunding on RocketHub, exceeding its $5000 goal. The money was used to purchase kitchen equipment and to ensure the kitchen was up to code. The restaurant opened in April 2013, and in July 2013, the center was awarded a three-year grant by the Drosos Foundation with the goal of making the program self-sustaining by 2016. The first group of trainees began training in February 2014. Within the first month of operation, several of the restaurant's customers had expressed interest in hiring future Amal graduates to work at local hotels and restaurants. The center completed a second round of crowdfunding on RocketHub in 2014, raising more than $9600. In October 2015 the center was awarded ‚Ç¨25,000 by the Orange Foundation. Belahcen Fitzgerald stated that the prize money would be used to help women start their own catering micro businesses.  Restaurant  Outdoor seating on the restaurant's terrace The restaurant's menu changes daily and includes traditional Moroccan dishes as well as international selections. The restaurant is open for lunch daily from 12:00 to 16:00, and for dinner by reservation for groups of 20 or more. A playroom and nursery, staffed by an American preschool teacher, is available for the children of staff and customers. Moroccan cuisine cooking classes for the public are available in Arabic, English, and French. As of August 2018 the restaurant averages 100 customers per day.  Trainees  The center's trainees are generally divorced mothers, widows, orphans, or former child maids, aged 18‚Äì35, who have little or no formal education. Participants are selected through partnerships with other non-profits or by the center's social worker, based on the criteria that they are economically disadvantaged and are motivated to train to achieve financial independence. Around 15‚Äì20 women are chosen twice a year to complete four to six months of training. After graduating from the training center, they are provided support to find relevant employment. As of June 2015 80% of Amal graduates have found employment in a relevant field. Over 200 women have been trained at the organization as of August 2018.  Staff and volunteers  Trainees and volunteers preparing lunch with the culinary teacher in the center's kitchen As of March 2018 the center has 25 full-time employees, including program staff and culinary teachers. As of 2015 the center has 12 full-time volunteers: an Arabic teacher, two English teachers, two French teachers, a translator, a life coach, two hygiene teachers, a psychologist, and two teachers who help the trainees develop conflict-resolution and communication skills. There are also several part-time volunteers, who help in various capacities as needed. The center also employs a social worker with a PhD in clinical psychology, who provides counselling. Belahcen Fitzgerald is the president of the organization. The managing director is Moulay Hassan Aladlouni.  Operation  Program participants receive job training, are trained in culinary arts and attend arts and crafts classes. They are provided with two meals a day, a transportation stipend, life-skills coaching, individual and group therapy, and a bonus upon successful completion of the program. Language classes are offered in Arabic literacy (because many of the trainees are illiterate), English, and French. In partnership with Search for Common Ground, the center educates the trainees on subjects such as life planning, empowerment, Nonviolent Communication, and reproductive health. Center staff help participants find employment with outside businesses upon graduation. About 45% of the training center's revenue comes from restaurant sales, 5% from private donations, and the remaining 50% from the Drosos Foundation.

The case took place in Husbands Bosworth, a small village not far from Leicester in 1616. John Smith fell into a series of violent fits, not even several men could hold him down. He made strange noises, and, as noted in a letter from Alderman Robert Heyrick to his brother Sir William, he would beat himself with inhuman strength, yet somehow remain unharmed. He gave extensive details on their familiars. The two judges, Sir Humphrey Winch and Sir Ranulph Crewe quickly condemned the women, rounding all 15 of them up. Nine of them were tried, found guilty and hanged for allegedly possessing John Smith. The other six were placed in prison to wait their turns. None of them were named before being hanged. King James I happened to be passing through about a month later, and heard what was going on. He called for John Smith to be questioned, and had little trouble determining the child was fraudulent. He broke down, and confessed the truth. Of the six women who had been imprisoned, only five of them were released, as one of them died inside. According to a timeline, the woman who had died told the jailer she was working with the witches against Smith the day before she died. She had begged him not to say anything because the witches would harm her. It was not until recently that courts began to consider child testimonies again, though they still deeply consider it before trusting them. Due to the Leicester Boy case, and others like it, many judges were wary of trusting anyone, especially children, in claims of witchcraft. The two judges associated with the cases had their reputation seriously damaged, and the story was transformed into a satirical comedy making fun of them in The Devil Is an Ass by Ben Jonson. Religious and Political Background During the time of the witch trials, it was not difficult to rile people up over accusations of witchcraft. The Witchcraft Act of 1604 had just been passed by King James. The act, which was named An Act Against Conjuration, Witchcraft and dealing with evil and wicked spirits, altered the law and made witchcraft a felony punishable by death. It added that it would be without the benefit of the clergy for anyone who \\"invoked evil spirits or communed with familiars\\". Ironically it was the King himself who put an end to the Leicester hysteria. Events Leading Up to the Trial Before the trial, James Smith began to have these strange fits during which he exhibited inhuman levels of strength. No number of men could hold the boy down, and he would beat himself, sometimes up to 300 times at once, all over his body without leaving a mark.. During these fits, he would speak in strangled phrases and contract his \\"whole body within the compass of a Joyn'd-stool\\". He would write in Hebrew and Greek characters. He told the judges, and others, that he was being possessed by witches' familiars, and described them at great length. He listed off \\"horse, cat, dog, pullemar, fish, code\\" and made out the animal's cries based on which was allegedly possessing him. The boy's family called in the Bosworth witches, nine of them, to attempt to exorcise the boy. However, they were unable to. It was July 1616. The women were hauled off, and hung. Later in the year, October, he accused six more women of witchcraft against him. The women were listed as anonymous, and unnamed, and hauled off for inquisition. The Trials It was 18 July 1616. The first six women were made to chant a counter spell, which was intended to identify them as witches. John Smith would cry out in pain and distress anytime they didn't chant: All nine of them were hung as witches in the trial that same day. The rest were imprisoned by the judges of assize, Sir Humphrey Winch and Sir Ranulph Crewe later in the year. Allegedly, one of the six women, listed as anonymous, confessed to the jailer that she was \\"in concert with her familiar, and with the other accused witches, to torment Smyth.\\" She begged him to keep her secret, and the following day, she died in the cell. King James came passing through, and caught wind of the witchcraft trials. He was curious, and wanted to see who had made the accusation. Upon learning that it was a mere 13-year-old boy, he summoned him as quickly as possible, and promptly declared him to be a fraud. The five survivors were released from prison. Aftermath and Legacy After the trials, Sir Humphrey and Sir Ranulph's careers took a rough hit, though they remained as judges for some time. English judges began to consider cases much more cautiously, in particular if they were told by children. King James gave Ben Jonson the permission to write The Devil is an Ass, in which he ridiculed them for their gullibility. Unfortunately, King James was not quick enough to save all 15 innocent women, however five of them survived.

Device gave evidence against her mother, brother and sister. Later in life, she was tried and found guilty in 1633‚Äì1634, and imprisoned until death. Tors√•ker Witch Trials The Tors√•ker witch trials in Sweden were intense, and children were actively used to give the trial the priest, Laurentius Christophori Horn√¶us, wanted. He would torture them psychologically and physically until they would say what he wanted them to say. 15 October over 100 people were accused, and a majority were executed. This went on until 1676, when authorities were finally able to prove that the children were falsely testifying. Sarah Good Sarah Good, along with Sarah Osborne and Tituba, were accused in February 1692 of afflicting Betty Parris and Abigail Williams, two young girls who were having hysterical fits and convulsions. The whole town wanted to rid themselves of Sarah Good, who was considered a homeless beggar. She simply repeated over and over that she was falsely accused. Her execution was in July 1692.

Victoria Square is a public square on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England. Developed in the 19th century, it is situated at the entrance to Portland, close to Chesil Beach, Osprey Quay, and the small fishing village of Chiswell. History The view from Victoria Gardens down to the square. Victoria Square was developed in association with the Portland Branch Railway, which commenced construction in 1860 and opened in 1865. With the Portland station being erected at the entrance to Underhill, Captain Charles Augustus Manning developed the surrounding area into a square at his sole expense, made up of the Royal Victoria Hotel and a terrace opposite. A range of businesses soon based themselves in the square, including the Portland Gas Works in 1863. A sawmill was erected next to the railway station, by the Portland Stone Company. A public house known as The Terminus Hotel was also built at the square, and later renamed the Little Ship. Portland's first Masonic Hall was erected in 1878 at Victoria Square, and was later replaced with a new hall opposite the original in 1898. The Little Ship. The Second World War brought many air raids to Portland due to the important naval base. A minefield was laid near the square, along with a tank trap. When Weymouth and Portland became an embarkation point of Allied Forces for D-Day in 1944, the Royal Victoria Lodge was used as a makeshift hospital. Following the closure of the Portland Gas Works in 1959, the site became a plant hire yard. Portland's railway operated until it closed to passengers in 1952 and goods in 1965. In 1969, the square's railway station was demolished and replaced by a roundabout. A commemorative stone and plaque was later placed near the square. Despite the construction of Chesil Cove's sea wall in 1958-1965, incidents of widespread flooding still occurred, including in December 1978 and February 1979, when two major storms flooded Chiswell and Victoria Square. Further flood prevention measures were then put in place in the 1980s. Victoria Square underwent refurbishment in 1995, with a commemorative stone unveiled by the Duke of York the following year. The northern area of the square is occupied by grassland and contains two ornamental pillars of Portland stone. They were unveiled in June 2004 and designed to be used as safe nesting sites for seagulls. Close to the square is the Portland Skate Park, which was established around 2005 at a cost of ¬£20,000. By 2009 it had fallen into disrepair and was replaced with a new ¬£200,000 park, which was officially opened in November 2010, when 150 young people from across Dorset attended the event.http://www.viewfrompublishing.co.uk/news_view/7516/11/1/portland- skaters-flock-back-to-new-park Grade listed buildings The Royal Victoria Lodge as seen in 2011.

The building, externally, is a complete example of a modest classical-style Victorian pub, holding a very important corner to this Square. The Royal Victoria Hotel also became Grade II Listed at the same time. Again it holds an important position on the corner of the Square, complementing The Little Ship opposite.

The novel's characters Otto and Anna Quangel are based on Otto and Elise Hampel. When their son dies in France, the couple start writing postcards to urge people to protest against Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime. The film stars Emma Thompson, Brendan Gleeson, Daniel Br√ºhl, and Mikael Persbrandt. Principal photography began on 27 March 2015 in Berlin. It was selected to compete for the Golden Bear at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival.  Plot  In 1940, a working-class couple in World War II-era Berlin, Otto and Anna Quangel, decide to resist Adolf Hitler and the Nazis after receiving news of the death of their only son. Their growing resistance to the regime is also strengthened by the fate of an old Jewish woman living in their building. Although the official deportation of Jews to death camps had not yet started, Jews have no recourse to any legal protection. Ruthless Nazis ‚Äî and \\"non-ideological\\" common criminals ‚Äî use the opportunity to loot the old woman's apartment with impunity. Despite the efforts of the Quangels and other kind neighbors to help her, the persecution ends with the old woman jumping to her death from a high window. The couple starts writing postcards to urge people to stand against Hitler and the Nazis and protest against them by furtively placing the cards in public places - a capital crime. Their first card reads: \\"Mothers, Hitler Will Kill Your Son Too\\". At first, Otto wants to do it all by himself, warning Anna, \\"They hang women, too!\\" She, however, insists on taking part in this dangerous activity. While in the beginning of the film the couple's marriage seems to have dried up, as they are unable to console each other for the loss of their son, their shared risk and commitment brings them closer. In effect, they fall in love with each other again. Gestapo inspector Escherich is charged with finding the source of the postcards. He is a professional police detective acting out of career pride rather than Nazi ideology. During three years of painstakingly gathering clues about the \\"Hobgoblin\\" (as he calls the mysterious writer of the postcards), he develops an increasing respect for this elusive unknown opponent. Because of his lack of progress, Escherich is beaten up by the obviously impatient SS senior officer. He is forced to summarily execute a man whom he is certain has no connection with these subversive postcards. After some postcards accidentally fall from his pocket when he is at work, Otto is exposed and arrested. He remains stoic about the certain death sentence awaiting him and tries in vain to take all the blame on himself and save Anna. After the couple have been executed, Escherich is alone in his office. He gathers up the couple's hundreds of postcards, scatters them from the open window of the police headquarters, then shoots himself. The film ends with the image of the postcards swirling in the wind, falling down on the Berlin streets and being picked up by passersby.

It was previously adapted as Alfred Vohrer's Everyone Dies Alone in 1975, along with West and East German made-for-television dramas in 1962 and 1970. Marco Pacchioni and Vincent P√©rez bought the rights to the novel in 2007. Upon publication of its English translation in 2009, it became a \\"surprise bestseller\\" in both the United States and United Kingdom. On 14 May 2014, it was announced that P√©rez would direct the film based on an adaptation he cowrote with Achim von Borries. Emma Thompson, Mark Rylance, and Daniel Br√ºhl were named for the principal roles. It was produced by X-Filme's Stefan Arndt and Uwe Schott (German rights), Master Movies' Marco Pacchioni (French rights) and Filmwave's Christian Grass and Paul Trijbits, and James Schamus. On 26 March 2015, Rylance was replaced by Brendan Gleeson. Other crew members included cinematographer Christophe Beaucarne, production designer Jean- Vincent Puzos, and editor Fran√ßois G√©digier. Alison Thompson handled most foreign sales for the film through her Sunray Films, although Path√© released it in French-speaking areas. The director dedicated the film \\"in memory of Otto and Elise Hampel guillotined for having written and circulated cards against the Nazi regime between 1940 and 1943.\\"  Filming  Principal photography on the film began on 27 March 2015 in Berlin. It was also shot in Cologne and G√∂rlitz.  Reception Alone in Berlin was first screened at the Berlin Film Festival in February 2016. Tara Brady of The Irish Times wrote: > \\"Despite a terrific triumvirate of performances from Gleeson, Thompson, and > Br√ºhl, and soft lensing from cinematographer Christophe Beaucarne, Alone in > Berlin is hampered by stodgy pacing, budgetary constraints, and drab > interiors.

Life Early years Ernst Schmutzer was born in 1930 in a small village in western Bohemia, which at that time had been part of Czechoslovakia for slightly more than a decade. By May 1945, when the war ended, he had attended schools in three different local villages. The area was occupied by the Americans on 1 May 1945, and less than a year later the entire German speaking population had been expelled. Schmutzer's schooling continued across the border in Weiden. By the time he passed his school final exams in 1949 he had been relocated again, this time to Waren (M√ºritz) in the northern part of what had at the time been designated the Soviet occupation zone in what remained of Germany. A few months later, in October 1949, the occupation zone was re- founded as the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Career progress He studied at the University of Rostock, obtaining his first degree in 1953 and his doctorate just two years later. His dissertation,Zur Theorie der Oberfl√§chenspannung starker konzentrierter elektrolytischer L√∂sungen for which he was supervised by Hans Falkenhagen, concerned Electrolyte. After this, in 1955 he obtained a position as a research assistant at the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena which is where in 1958 he obtained his habilitation (a higher academic qualification). He obtained a lectureship at Jena in 1959 and in 1960 a professorship (with a teaching contract) in Theoretical physics. From 1968 till 1990 he was in charge of the \\"Relativistic Physics\\" field at Jena, serving between 1974 and 1978 as Dean of the Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Engineering faculty. Between 1990 and his retirement in 1993 he was Rector of Jena's Friedrich Schiller University in succession to Hans Schmigalla. Focus Schmutzer is concerned with the Theories of Relativity and Gravitation. He investigated extensions of General relativity theory in a supplementary spatial dimension which he terms \\"Projective Unified Field Theory\\" (\\"Projektive Einheitliche Feldtheorie\\"), extrapolating from the ideas of Theodor Kaluza.Those who had previously worked on similar ideas (\\"Projective Unified Field Theory\\") included, during the 1950s, Wolfgang Pauli, Pascual Jordan. This invokes five space-time dimensions including a massive supplementary scalar field which, according to Schmutzer, can serve as an explanation for the accelerating expansion of the universe identified in the 1990s (as a candidate for dark energy) and for the Pioneer effect. According to Schmutzer's theory the singularities of General relativity theory are smoothed, so that instead of a \\"Big bang\\" singularity, matter begins with a more gentle progression which Schmutzer terms an \\"Urstart\\". Politics Politics was peripheral to Ernst Schmutzer's career, but in the German Democratic Republic it was hard to entirely ignore the country's ruling Socialist Unity Party. He joined the SED (party) in 1949, but was then expelled from it in 1958. The official report contained the conclusions that Schmutzer was in a fundamental disagreement with Party Policy regarding the practical transformation of the university. Following months of discussions in which Dr. Schmutzer had shown total disregard for party policy regarding scientific work, the conclusion was reached that his membership in the party could only be damaging to it, and he was expelled from the party.\\"[er] mit Grundfragen der Politik der Partei nicht einverstanden war (Praxis der Umgestaltung der Hochschule). Nach monatelangen Auseinandersetzungen mit Herrn Dr. Schmutzer, in denen sich insgesamt eine Geringsch√§tzung der Politik gegen√ºber Wissenschaftlicher Arbeit zeigt, kam die Grundorganisation zur Auffassung, dass Dr. Schmutzer als Mitglied der Partei nur sch√§dlich sein kann, deshalb erfolgte sein Ausschluss.\\" Political exclusion turned out less damaging to Schmutzer's career than might have been anticipated. He was one of just a handful of Jena professors permitted to visit western universities as a guest lecturer. In 1967 he taught at Queen Mary College in London. International reputation Schmutzer became one of East Germany's leading theoretical physicists. An internationally recognised authority on Gravitational Physics, in 1979 he was able to celebrate Albert Einstein's centenary by attracting to Jena the \\"9th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation\\" which took place in July 1980. In Jena he created a School of Gravitation Physics, members of which include Hans Stephani, Dietrich Kramer and Eduard Herlt, and which has established a name for itself, most notably, with investigation of precise solutions for the Einstein field equations. Between 1980 and 1990 he was a principal editor of the scientific journal \\"Experimentelle Technik der Physik\\". Schmutzer's published output includes a comprehensive textbook on Theoretical Physics as well as an Introduction to Relativity Theory. His latest volume, \\"F√ºnfdimensionale Physik\\" (\\"Five Dimensional Physics\\"), appeared in 2009 and was republished in 2014.

His production of a 10-episode dramatic TV series titled We Are New York, which was funded by and produced for the Mayor‚Äôs Office of New York, won two Emmy Awards in 2010. Early life Krakowski was born in Warsaw in 1946. His father was at different times a high-ranking politician, head of national tourism, political prisoner, and finally the production head of a government owned film studio ‚ÄòKamera‚Äô. His mother, a radio journalist, had held several important international posts in her field. His maternal grandmother was a Polish revolutionary, killed in Auschwitz, whose name is still affixed to schools, factories and streets throughout Poland. Andrzej Krakowski thus grew up surrounded by the powerful men of politics on the one hand, and the creative, often politically daring, geniuses of Polish cinema on the other. World renowned artists, writers and philosophers such as Diego Rivera, Pablo Picasso, Ilia Ehrenburg, Nazim Hikmet, Max Frisch, Pablo Neruda, Yves Montand and Leszek Kolakowski were just a few of the many guests at the Krakowski home. Education Krakowski received his education at the Polish National Film School in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. He studied under several prominent film directors and worked as an intern assistant to Andrzej Wajda during the making of Ashes. Attacked in the press after the March ‚Äô68 student demonstrations, Krakowski was unexpectedly offered a scholarship in Hollywood. Shortly after his arrival in the U.S., he was stripped of his Polish citizenship and forbidden to return to his homeland. In 2014 Krakowski received a Ph.D. in Film Arts from PWSFTviT in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. Career In 1970, alongside David Lynch, Terrence Malick, Paul Schrader and Jeremy Kagan, he became a producing auditor, and then fellow, at the American Film Institute. During this period he worked on and line-produced several films for his AFI colleagues: Terrence Malick's Lanton Mills, Richard Patterson‚Äôs Open Window, Jeremy Kagan‚Äôs Love Song by Charles Faberman and Oscar Williams‚Äô The Final Comedown, launching careers of such actors as Ron Rifkin and Billy Dee Williams. Some of those films eventually attained a cult status and are being taught at American colleges as part of film curriculum. Upon completing his education Krakowski joined YASNY Productions, Inc. as head of production. Among films he had green-lighted and supervised production of was the 1976 Oscar nominated feature documentary California Reich. After leaving YASNY, he continued producing films with his own Filmtel, Inc, including Portrait of a Hitman, starring Rod Steiger and Jack Palance, and White Dragon, starring Christopher Lloyd and Dee Wallace Stone. The latter was the first co-production between CBS network and Perspektywa, a Polish government owned studio. In less than three years, Filmtel grew from a small production company into an international production and distribution conglomerate with offices in Los Angeles, New York, London and Sydney. Expanding into television, Filmtel co-financed and distributed such successful TV shows as The Richard Simmons Show (for 4 years #1 daily-strip show) and Showtime‚Äôs XIV International Championship of Magic, hosted by the legendary Tony Randall. After selling Filmtel, Krakowski returned to his first love, and today his screenwriting credits include: Triumph of the Spirit, starring Willem Dafoe and Edward James Olmos, Eminent Domain, with Donald Sutherland and Anne Archer, Tides of War, a vehicle for Ernest Borgnine and David Soul, Genghis Khan with Charlton Heston, the most expensive Italian production to date, Ogniem i Mieczem (With Fire and Sword), the highest-grossing film in Poland, and Managua, with Louis Gossett, Jr and Assumpta Serna in the lead. Facing the loss of his wife to breast cancer, Krakowski wrote, produced and directed a feature-length documentary The Politics of Cancer, which received theatrical distribution in the U.S., and were shown at the Cannes, Palm Springs and Santa Barbara Film Festivals. During 1997-2002 Krakowski, aside from his creative work, became a co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of two successful television networks: the first dual platform (over-the-air and satellite) in Central Europe NaszaTV (now Scripps Networks) and the first US Internet TV network (ForeignTV.com) in New York. In the first decade of 2000, Krakowski produced and directed a feature film based on a popular comic book, Campfire Stories, which has been sold to over 30 countries, a hit stage musical in Tokyo Felix The Cat‚Äôs Musical Journey, a feature-length docudrama Farewell To My Country, chronicling the expulsion of the last Polish Jews from their homeland in 1968, and several commercials for Mercedes and BWIA airlines featuring Geoffrey Holder. Krakowski‚Äôs latest feature film, Looking for Palladin, was shot in Antigua, Guatemala.https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/30/movies/30looking.html?_r=0 NYTimes. Retrieved 4 April 2015. The cast includes such veteran American actors as Ben Gazzara, Talia Shire, David Moscow and Vincent Pastore, as well as Latin American stars such as Ang√©lica Arag√≥n, Pedro Armend√°riz Jr., Roberto D√≠az Gomar and the Morales Brothers. The film won several awards at international film festivals such as Best Feature Film at the Queens International Film Festival; Best Feature Film and Best Ensemble Cast at the Orlando Hispanic Film Festival, and Best Production Company at the Napa/Sonoma International Film Festival.\\" It was released theatrically in 2010-11. Krakowski‚Äôs latest TV production, a 10-episode dramatic TV series titled We Are New York, was nominated for four and won two Emmy Awards in 2010. Krakowski is the author of several books, among them: Pollywood and The World Through The Eye of a Screenwriter, as well as contributing co-author of the New York Times bestseller No Better Friend. Krakowski is one of the founders of the highly regarded (5 student Oscars within its first 8 years) SUNY- Purchase film program. He is currently a tenured professor and the former Chair of Media & Communication Arts Department at the City College of New York, where he teaches film directing, screenwriting and production.

Salvacion, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines. The cathedral, which is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bayombong, is under the patronage of Saint Dominic. Saint Dominic Cathedral of Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines was founded in 1739 by the Augustinian Friars of Spain. Church history It was April 12, 1739 when the first Eucharistic Celebration was held there with Fray Pedro Freire presiding. During these days in the 18th century, this cathedral was still called The Church of St. Augustine. It won‚Äôt be until a few months later, on September 8, that it will be dedicated to St. Dominic De Guzman. The mission in present-day Bayombong had its roots in the mid-18th century when it was formally accepted by the Dominicans as mission center in a region previously referred to as Paniqui. Soon after founding the mission, the erection of the church structure took place in 1780 under the supervision of Father Juan Crespo, OP. According to records, the church, and other nearby structures, was gutted by fire in 1892. Father Cerefino Martinez, O.P. initiated the reconstruction of the church. It was completed three years after, in 1895, with the installation of galvanized iron roofing, new altarpieces and a new pulpit. Architecture The church fa√ßade is described as a close copy of that of the Dupax del Sur Church and the Santa Catalina de Siena Church (Bambang) in Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya, with its doors, windows and oculus, not to mention the pediment shape that‚Äôs also similar to that of the older Tuguegarao Cathedral in Cagayan province. A difference, however between this church and the two above-mentioned churches is the lack of columns framing the windows. The slightly-detached, octagonal campanile is also distinct to the church of Bayombong. The fa√ßade, with its squat appearance, is divided into four sections by cornices. The fa√ßade is ornamented with two windows on the second level (flanking a saint‚Äôs niche) and an oculus on the third level.

It is approximately long and flows through Covington Township, Spring Brook Township, and Moosic in Lackawanna County and Pittston Township in Luzerne County. The watershed of the stream has an area of . It is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery above Interstate 476 and as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery below it. A section is also designated as Class A Wild Trout Waters. The stream's tributaries include Panther Creek, Plank Bridge Creek, Rattlesnake Creek, Green Run, Monument Creek, and Covey Swamp Creek. It has a relatively high level of water quality and is very slightly acidic, with a pH of 6.4 to 6.9. The upper reaches of the watershed of Spring Brook are mountainous and swampy. Further downstream, the stream flows through a water gap in the Moosic Mountains. Sandstone, shale, and some coal are present in the vicinity of the stream. It has been channelized in a concrete channel for part of its length and is the main source of flooding in Spring Brook Township, Lackawanna County. The stream is the second-largest tributary of the Lackawanna River. Reservoirs on Spring Brook include the Spring Brook Intake, the Nesbitt Reservoir, the Watres Reservoir. There are three dams on the stream. The watershed is mainly forested, with only a small amount of urban land. In the past, industries in the watershed of Spring Brook included timbering, coal mining, and agriculture. Two railroads also passed through the watershed in the early 1900s, at least one of which was established by the 1880s. The stream's watershed has served as a water supply since at least the early 1900s and still serves as a water supply for the Lackawanna Valley. Several bridges have also been constructed across the stream in the 20th century. The stream has been part of several studies since 1970. Part of its length is navigable by kayaking, paddling, and rafting. Course Spring Brook begins near Interstate 380 in Covington Township, Lackawanna County. It flows south for a short distance before meandering west for a few miles, crossing Interstate 380 and entering Spring Brook Township. The stream then turns south for several tenths of a mile before turning northwest for several tenths of a mile. It turns southwest before turning north-northwest and flowing around The Hogback. On the northern side of that hill, the stream turns south and then northwest, entering the Watres Reservoir. The stream exits the reservoir on its western side and flows northwest for a few miles, passing Pinnacle Hill and receiving the tributaries Panther Creek and Plank Bridge Creek from the left. It eventually bends east and enters the Nesbitt Reservoir after crossing Pennsylvania Route 502. Here, it receives the tributary Rattlesnake Creek from the right and flows between high hills. On the northern side of the reservoir, the stream flows north, receiving the tributary Green Run from the right before turning west-southwest. A few miles further downstream, it passes through the Spring Brook Intake before exiting Lackawanna County. Upon exiting Lackawanna County, Spring Brook enters Pittston Township, Luzerne County. It receives the tributary Monument Creek from the left and turns north-northwest for a few miles, flowing alongside Pennsylvania Route 502. On this stretch, it leaves behind the hills that it flows through, crosses Pennsylvania Route 502, and exits Luzerne County. Upon exiting Luzerne County, the stream enters Moosic, Lackawanna County and continues flowing north-northwest and receives the tributary Covey Swamp Creek from the right. The stream then turns west- southwest for a short distance before turning south and then west, crossing Interstate 81. It then turns northwest for a few tenths of a mile, crossing US Route 11 before reaching its confluence with the Lackawanna River. Spring Brook joins the Lackawanna River upriver of its mouth. Tributaries Spring Brook has numerous named tributaries: Panther Creek, Plank Bridge Creek, Rattlesnake Creek, Green Run, Monument Creek, and Covey Swamp Creek. Panther Creek joins Spring Brook upstream of its mouth. Its watershed has an area of . Plank Bridge Creek joins Spring Brook upstream of its mouth. Its watershed has an area of . Rattlesnake Creek joins Spring Brook upstream of its mouth. Its watershed has an area of . Green Run reaches its confluence with Spring Brook upstream of its mouth. Its watershed has an area of . Spring Brook also has numerous unnamed tributaries. Hydrology Spring Brook experiences noticeable flow loss. As of 2009, it has high levels of sodium and alkalinity. Pittson Township and the borough of Moosic have permits to discharge stormwater into it. However, the water quality and habitat quality of the stream are relatively unimpacted. The stream has relatively high water quality even where it flows through a concrete channel. In a study by the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, it was found not to fail any water quality standards either during base flow or storm flow conditions. However, a study from the previous year found concentrations of sodium and alkalinity exceeding the threshold for concern. In the early 1900s, Spring Brook was a clear stream in its upper reaches. However, by the time it reached the property of the Du Pont Powder Company, it was affected by slush pumped into it by the Pennsylvania Coal Company. Between 1971 and 1990, the streamflow of Spring Brook ranged from 0.900 to 27.0 cubic feet per second. The discharge ranged from 0.06 to 22 cubic feet per second in the 1970s. The gage height of the stream in the 1970s ranged from . The peak annual discharge of the stream at its mouth has a 10 percent chance of reaching 5050 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 10,900 cubic feet per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 14,700 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 29,500 cubic feet per second. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in Spring Brook at the community of Spring Brook was measured to be 10.6 milligrams per liter in 1975. The concentration of hydrogen ions was measured to range from 0.00013 to 0.00040 milligrams per liter in the 1970s. The concentration of carbon dioxide ranged from 2.2 to 6.2 milligrams per liter and the bicarbonate concentration ranged from 9 to 12 milligrams per liter. The sulfate concentration in Spring Brook ranged from 12.0 to 19.0 milligrams per liter. The chloride concentration ranged between 3.7 and 8.0 milligrams per liter. The concentration of organic nitrogen in Spring Brook at the community of Spring Brook was measured to be 0.09 milligrams per liter in 1975. The concentration of ammonia in the form of nitrogen was measured to be 0.040 milligrams per liter. The concentration of nitrates in the form of nitrogen was 0.74 milligrams per liter and the concentration of nitrites in the form of nitrogen ranged from 0.045 to 0.29 milligrams per liter in 1971. The concentration of sodium and potassium (as Na) in Spring Brook ranged from 1.4 to 3.9 milligrams per liter. The concentration of magnesium ranged from 0.90 to 1.60 milligrams per liter and the calcium concentration ranged from 7.30 to 8.80 milligrams per liter. The concentration of recoverable iron in the stream was measured to be 60 micrograms per liter in 1975. The concentration of alkalinity in the waters of Spring Brook between the Watres Dam and the Nesbitt Reservoir is 11 milligrams per liter. In the 1970s, the stream's pH ranged from 6.4 to 6.9. The total concentration of water hardness ranged from 23 to 28 milligrams per liter. The turbidity of the stream at the community of Spring Brook was one measured to be less than 5 Jackson Turbidity Units. The specific conductance of the stream ranged from 60 to 78 micro-siemens per centimeter at during five measurements in the 1970s. The concentration of dissolved solids in the stream was measured to be 54 milligrams per liter in 1975. Geography, geology, and climate The elevation near the mouth of Spring Brook is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is approximately above sea level. The gradient of the creek is per mile. The topography of the watershed of Spring Brook is mainly mountainous, with swampy land in its upper reaches. Some bogs are also present in this area. Wetlands near the stream's headwaters include the Yostville marshes. In the stream's middle and lower reaches, its valley is flanked by steep, high mountains. Its channel is sinuous and flows through rock formations consisting of sandstone and shale. There is also some coal in the lower reaches of the watershed. There are some culm dumps along the stream between Pennsylvania Route 502 and US Route 11. Spring Brook flows across the Pocono Plateau and passes through the Moosic Mountains via a water gap known as the Spring Brook Gap. Its mouth is in the Lackawanna Valley. In its lower reaches, the stream is channelized in a large open concrete channel. A number of bank stabilization projects have been done on the stream from Belin Village downstream to its mouth. Some land in the vicinity of the stream is designated as a 100 year floodplain. There are a number of dams on Spring Brook. One of these is the Spring Brook Intake Dam, which was determined in 1980 to be in good condition. Another is the Nesbitt Dam and a third is the Watres Dam. Most of the Group A and Group B soils in Spring Brook Township, Lackawanna County are located along Spring Brook. These soils groups consist mainly of Pope soils. The average annual rate of precipitation in the watershed of Spring Brook is between . The water temperature of the stream at the community of Spring Brook ranged from in five measurements during the 1970s. Watershed The watershed of Spring Brook has an area of . The watershed is in southern Lackawanna County and northeastern Luzerne County. It is in the lower part of the Lackawanna River watershed, in its south-central and southwestern section. The watershed is part of the North Pocono Watershed region of the Lackawanna River watershed. The mouth of the stream is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Avoca. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Moscow. The creek mainly flows in a northwesterly direction. Spring Brook is the second-largest tributary of the Lackawanna River, after Roaring Brook. It is a third-order stream. A significant portion of the watershed is forested. However, some residential areas, such as Yostville, Maple Lake, and Spring Brook Village are in the stream's vicinity. The stream also flows through an urban area in Moosic. Its headwaters are near Yostville. However, only a few square miles of the watershed is urban. Approximately 60 percent of the stream's watershed is owned by the Theta Company as of 2006. Reservoirs and ponds in the watershed of Spring Brook include the Spring Brook Intake, the Nesbitt Reservoir, the Watres Reservoir, and Maple Lake. The first three are used as drinking water reservoirs and the lakes also serve as flood protection. The Pennsylvania American Water Company owns all four lakes and several hundred acres of the surrounding land. There are flood levees at the mouth of the stream. There is some evidence of coal mining on a ridge overlooking the area in the stream's vicinity. However, residential encroachment on the stream's floodplain is a more significant environmental concern. Spring Brook is the main source of flooding in Spring Brook Township, Lackawanna County. History and industries Spring Brook was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1188206. Spring Brook provided power for early lumbering in Spring Brook Township, Lackawanna County. In the early 1900s, the main industries in the watershed of Spring Brook included coal mining and agriculture. The Pennsylvania Coal Company historically had a washery that discharged into the stream. The Du Pont Powder Company also operated in the watershed at that time. A railroad line along the stream was present by the 1880s. The Wilkes-Barre and Eastern Railroad also crossed the stream's watershed and the Scranton and Spring Brook Railroad followed the stream between Rockdale and its mouth. During this time period, major communities in the watershed included Moosic, which had a population of 3964 at the time. The main stem and several tributaries were also historically used as a water supply by the Spring Brook Water Supply Company. The stream is still used as an important water supply in the Lackawanna Valley, as of 2001. Together with Roaring Brook and Stafford Meadow Brook, it serves as a water supply to a substantial part of the valley. Some areas of the watershed have been subjected to extensive timbering programs as recently as 2001. The Nesbitt Water Filtration Plant is in the watershed, in Pittston Township, Luzerne County. It is owned by the Pennsylvania American Water Company. Spring Brook flooded during Hurricane Diane in 1955, reaching a discharge of near Moosic and destroying three homes and inundating the basements and first floors of many others. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection constructed a levee on the stream after this flooding event. The stream also experienced bank failure during floods in October 1985 and January 1996. It also flooded homes and trailers in its vicinity. A two-span steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying Main Street/State Route 3024 over Spring Brook was built in 1956. It is long and is situated in Moosic. Another bridge of the same type was built over the stream in 1957. This bridge is long and is in Pittston Township. A two-span prestressed box beam or girders bridge was built over the stream in Moosic in 1958. It is long and carries Pennsylvania Route 502. Another bridge of the same type (but with only one span) was built in Moosic in 1959 and repaired in 1985. It carries US Route 11 and is long. In 1961, a two-span steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge was built over the stream in Moosic. It is long and carries Pennsylvania Route 502. A prestressed box beam carrying Pennsylvania Route 502 over the stream was constructed in 1987. This bridge is in Pittston Township and has a length of . Spring Brook has been studied several times. It was studied by the United States Geological Survey from 1971 to 1975, by Daniels (working for the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission) in 1976, by Rider and Blacksmith (working for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection) in 1985, by Copeland (working for the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission) in 1992, by Moase (working for the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission) in 1993, and Popp and McGurl in 2003. The stream is on the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Bureau of Abandoned Mine Restoration's priority list for restoration. Biology The drainage basin of Spring Brook is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from its headwaters downstream to the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 476). From that point downstream to its mouth, the drainage basin of the stream is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in Spring Brook from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. A 2.4-mile (4-kilometer) section of the stream from the Watres Dam downstream to the Nesbitt Reservoir is considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters for both brook trout and brown trout. The tributaries Green Run and Panther Creek are Class A Wild Trout Waters for brook trout and part of the tributary Rattlesnake Creek is Class A Wild Trout Waters for both brook trout and brown trout. Numerous macroinvertebrate species have been observed in Spring Brook. A total of 18 genera are from the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera. A short distance upstream of the Watres Reservoir, the most common genera taxa were the family Chironomidae and the genera Drunella, Ephemerella, and Hydropsyche. Of a 200-individual sample, 34, 28, 25, and 20 individuals of each taxon have been observed, respectively. Slightly less common are the genera Epeorus, Hexatoma, Leuctra, and Lepidostoma. Of the 200-individual sample, 15, 13, 11, and 10 individuals of each taxon have been observed, respectively. Still less common are the genera Baetis, Paraleptophlebia, Acroneuria, Stenonema, Nigronia, Agapetus, DoIophilodes, and Optioservus. In the 200-individual sample, 8, 6, 5, 4, 4, 3, 2, and 2 individuals of each taxon have been observed, respectively. Only one individual each of the genera Isonychia, Amphinemura, Cheumatopsyche, Rhycophila, Neophylax, Psephenus, Boyeria, Tabanus, and Cambarus were observed. The wetlands at the headwaters of Spring Brook are home to boreal forest trees. These include black spruce, paper birch, and tamarack. Huckleberry, lady's slipper, leather leaf, mountain laurel, pitcher plant, and rhododendron plants inhabit bogs in the area. The modified Hilsenhoff Biotic Index value of Spring Brook a short distance upstream of the Watres Reservoir is 2.56. The modified EPT Index value at this location is 15. The taxa richness value is 26. Recreation A trail known as the Spring Brook / Wilkes-Barre and Eastern Greenway was proposed in the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan in 2001. There are plans for trails on the flood levee at the stream's mouth and on the old Wilkes-Barre and Eastern Railroad corridor. A stretch of at least of Spring Brook are navigable by kayaking, paddling, or rafting. This stretch runs from the Nesbitt Reservoir to Moosic. The difficulty of the stream ranges from Class II to Class IV. Spring Brook is an approved trout stream. In 1996, it was opened for trout fishing on April 29.

Her writings were centred on love and sex, as was her own life. Biography Henningsen was born on the Skovsbo estate in the south of Funen where her father was the farmer. After both her mother and father died when she was young, she and her sister were sent by the family to the girls boarding school at Antvorskov near Slagelse. After the unfortunate events in her family, Henningsen remained an atheist for the rest of her life. She married Mads Henningsen, a schoolteacher, with whom she had three children before the marriage ended in divorce after he left her to emigrate to America. The father of her fourth child, the architect and designer Poul Henningsen, was the writer Carl Ewald. As a single mother, Agnes Henningsen earned a living for a time as a hairdresser in central Copenhagen but later devoted all her time to writing. While still married, she developed a friendship with Herman Bang who in 1891 helped her to have a number of short stories published in the newspaper K√∏benhavn using the pen name Helga Maynert. After a number of difficult years in Copenhagen, in 1898 Henningsen moved to Roskilde where she was able to concentrate on writing. In 1899, she published her first novel, Glansbilledet (Scrap Picture), immediately followed by Str√∏mmen (The Current). Influenced by Bang's impressionism, both depict somewhat frigid, depressive women who suffer from a lack of work and staid egocentric attitudes. In 1900, she began a period of frequent travel, successive new lovers and interesting friendships with figures from Copenhagen's cultural scene which led to her portraits of Gustav Wied, Holger Drachmann and Georg Brandes. After spending a lengthy period in Poland, in 1901 she gained literary fame with Polens D√∏tre (Poland's Daughters), an intimate work describing the unhappy relationships two women have with the same man, as a result of their platonic views and misgivings about sex. Here Henningsen develops a much more direct style of her own, free from Bang's influence. In 1919, she married the writer Simon Koch but continued her extramarital relationships, refusing to adopt the conventions of the bourgeoisie. Her most successful works are her eight volumes of memoirs (Erindringer) from 1941 to 1955, tracing the various episodes of her life: Let Gang paa Jorden (Stepping Lightly on the Ground), Letsindighedens Gave (Gift of Recklessness), Byen erobret (City Conquered), K√¶rlighedssynder (Sins of Love), D√∏dsfjende-Hjertensk√¶r (Mortal Enemy- Heartthrob), Jeg er Levemand (I'm Alive), Den rige Fugl (The Rich Bird) and Skygger over Vejen (Shadows on the Road). For most of her life, Henningsen was disliked by her contemporaries for her free sexual views and behaviour but she later saw more positive interest in her work from the younger generation. When the Danish Academy was founded in 1960, she was one of its two female members, the other being Karen Blixen.

The timber extended to the upper deck; it was in two layers from the keel to 3 ft (.9 m) above the water line, and one layer above.Osbon (1963), p. 196. It was fitted with 3-cylinder compound engines with one high-pressure cylinder of diameter being flanked by two low- pressure cylinders of diameter.

Under the lower deck were spaces for water, provisions, coal, and magazines for shell and powder. Amidships were the engine and boiler rooms. These were covered by an armoured deck, 1.5 inches (38 mm) thick and approximately 100 ft (30 m) long. This armour was about 3 ft (90 cm) below the lower deck, and the space between could be used for additional coal bunkerage. The machinery spaces were flanked by coal bunkers, affording the machinery and magazines some protection from the sides. The lower deck was used for berthing of the ship's company; officers aft, warrant and petty officers forward, and ratings amidships, as was traditional. The tops of the coal bunkers, which projected above deck level, were used for seating at the mess tables.

He served as director of finances of Egypt and Syria under the Tulunid dynasty and the Abbasid Caliphate, as well as becoming vizier for the Tulunid ruler Harun ibn Khumarawayh, and later occupying high office under the Ikhshidids.  Life  Born in 871, Muhammad was the son of Ali ibn Ahmad al-Madhara'i and grandson of the family's founder, Abu Bakr Ahmad. Ahmad had been appointed head of finances of Tulunid Egypt in 879, and his family were likewise appointed to senior positions in the fiscal bureaucracy. As its nisba shows, the family hailed from the village of Madharaya near Wasit in lower Iraq. Muhammad came to Egypt in 885, where his father had become vizier to the Tulunid ruler, Khumarawayh (reigned 884‚Äì896). Ali appointed him deputy director of finances. His father was murdered along with Khumarawayh's short- lived successor, Jaysh, in 896, and Muhammad became vizier of the new Tulunid ruler, Harun (r. 896‚Äì904). Following the overthrow of the Tulunids and the re- establishment of direct control over Egypt and Syria by the Abbasid Caliphate in 904‚Äì5, Muhammad and many of his followers were deported to the Abbasid capital, Baghdad, while his uncle, Abu Ali al-Husayn, thanks to his contacts in the Abbasid court, managed to survive the regime change and become financial director of Egypt. The family now became involved in factional struggles between the leading bureaucratic factions in Baghdad, siding with the opposition to the Banu'l-Furat clan. Its fortunes fluctuated as a result: in 913, al-Husayn was moved once more to Syria, while Muhammad departed Baghdad to take over the finances in Egypt, but both were dismissed in 917, when the Banu'l-Furat regained the vizierate in Baghdad. Muhammad then retired to private life in the Egyptian capital, Fustat. The family had already amassed an enormous fortune through its control of the province's finances, but Muhammad went on to increase it further. At the same time, he publicly expressed his religious piety, by going to the annual hajj to Mecca every year between 913 and 934, and distributing lavish presents to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina and their inhabitants. He was re-appointed to the direction of Egyptian finances in 930, under the governorship of his friend Takin al- Khazari, but lost it again after Takin's death in 933. In the factional strife that engulfed Egypt after Takin's death, Muhammad played a major role, and was an opponent to Takin's son Muhammad. In 935, Muhammad ibn Tughj was appointed governor of Egypt by the Abbasid vizier Abu'l-Fath al-Fadl (another member of the Banu'l-Furat). Although Ibn Tughj reached out to him and sought an amicable agreement, Muhammad refused to recognize his appointment and tried to resist his takeover of Egypt, but his troops defected to Ibn Tughj without a fight. Following Ibn Tughj's entry into Fustat in August 935, Muhammad went into hiding, but when Abu'l-Fath al-Fadl himself abandoned Baghdad and came to Egypt in 937, the al-Madhara'i were arrested, and Muhammad had to surrender much of his fortune to the treasury. After the death of Abu'l-Fath al-Fadl in 939, he was released from prison and soon regained his rank and power in the Ikhshidid court. By the time of Ibn Tughj's death in 946, he was strong enough to become the de facto regent for Ibn Tughj's under-age son Unujur, but he was soon overthrown and imprisoned in a coup orchestrated by Abu'l-Fath al-Fadl's son Ja'far. He was released in 947 by the new strongman, Kafur, and retired once more into private life. His death at Fustat on 16 January 957 ended the al-Madhara'i line.

These flights usually follow a great circle route, often passing over a polar region. In some cases, non-stop ultra-long-haul routes could be less preferable to stopover flights as passengers on ultra-long-haul nonstop flights must sit in the aircraft for those long hours. A low-oil-price environment would favor the establishment of ultra-long-haul flights. The longest commercial flight in the world is currently Singapore Airlines Flight 22, which flies from Singapore Changi Airport to Newark Liberty International Airport History From 1943 to 1945, Qantas operated \\"The Double Sunrise\\", a weekly flight between Perth, Australia and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), with average flight times of 28 (maximum of 33) hours using a Consolidated PBY Catalina.Defence, Australian Government, Department of. \\"RAAF Museum: Royal Australian Air Force\\". www.airforce.gov.au.

On October 1‚Äì2, 1957, a Trans World Airlines Lockheed L-1649 Starliner, the ultimate piston-engine airliner in terms of range and endurance, flew the inaugural London‚ÄìSan Francisco polar route in 23 hours, 19 minutes.Peter J. Marson, The Lockheed Constellation. Tonbridge, Kent, England: Air-Britain (Historians), 2007 In June 1961, El Al began a route from New York City to Tel Aviv. Previously tested in December 1957 on trial runs with a Bristol Britannia, the scheduled flight used a Boeing 707 and averaged 9 hours, 33 minutes. In February 1963, Aeroflot started a Moscow-Havana flight via Murmansk with its Tu-114D. It was around 16 hours from Havana to Murmansk, the longest for a scheduled turboprop flight. In August 1967, Aerolineas Argentinas established nonstop Boeing 707 service on a route between Madrid and Buenos Aires, with a flight time of 12 hours. This route is the world's first nonstop flight to exceed the 10,000-km distance threshold, and was the longest scheduled flight by distance until 1976, when the Boeing 747SP entered service. In April 1976, Pan Am set the new record with its JFK‚ÄìTokyo route. In December, the airline set another record with Sydney‚ÄìSan Francisco, covering . On February 10, 1974, a LAN Chile Boeing 707 flown by captain Jorge Jarpa Reyes made the world's first transpolar non- stop flight between South America (Punta Arenas Airport) and Australia (Sydney Kingsford-Smith Airport), completing a 5935 nmi trip. In May 1988, El Al introduced its long-haul passenger flight from Tel Aviv to Los Angeles, completing its journey in 13 hours, 41 minutes. The dissolution of the Soviet Union eventually opened the airspace over Russia, allowing new circumpolar routes to come into use for commercial airlines. On 1 March 2001, Continental Airlines launched a nonstop service from Newark to Hong Kong--the first nonstop, long-haul route for any airline with a flying duration exceeding 16 hours. A few days later, United Airlines started its own JFK‚ÄìHong Kong service, adding 3 kilometers to the distance. On 3 February 2004, Singapore Airlines introduced a flight from Singapore to Los Angeles, scheduled for 16 hours, 30 minutes in the summer, 15 hours, 35 minutes in the winter. It took 17 hours, 20 minutes in summer and 18 hours, 5 minutes in winter on the return trip. In June 2004, Singapore Airlines introduced Flight SQ 21, using the Airbus A340-500 (now an Airbus A350-900 ULR since October 2018) on a great circle route from Newark to Singapore, passing within of the North Pole, taking a little over 18 hours. This was immediately surpassed by return Flight SQ 22, which flew the current record of back to Newark. Despite the greater distance, Flight SQ 22 averaged a slightly shorter 17 hours, 45 minutes because of prevailing high-altitude winds. In the late 2000s/early 2010s, rapidly rising fuel prices, coupled with an economic crisis, resulted in cancellation of many ultra-long-haul nonstop flights. This included the services provided by Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Newark and Los Angeles, as well as similar lengthy flights from New York to both Mumbai and Bangkok. However, in recent years the fuel prices have fallen back and more economical aircraft have been introduced to the market. The economics of ultra-long-haul flights improved with more and more distant markets being served by new services. On 2 December 2015, Air India launched a nonstop flight from Delhi to San Francisco, which was the world's longest flight by distance at 15,128 kilometres (8,168 nmi). Similar lengthy flights have been launched from Auckland to both Doha and Dubai in the past 2 years, as well as new double-daily service by United and Singapore Airlines from San Francisco to Singapore. As of , Singapore Airlines currently operates the world's longest flight by distance from Singapore to Newark at 15,357 kilometres (8,292 nmi). Airliners The longest range jetliner in service is the Airbus A350 XWB Ultra Long Range, capable of flying up to . The A380 is capable of flying with 544 passengers. The A350-900 can fly with 325 passengers. The longest range Boeing airliner in service is the 777-200LR, which is capable of flying with 317 passengers in a 2-class configuration. New airliners like the A330neo, A350 and B787 enable economically sustainable nonstop ultra-long haul operations on thinner routes with fewer demands, because all the previous planes capable of providing nonstop ultra-long haul services are larger and thus more expensive to operate compared to these planes, which in turn require more tickets to be sold and more demands between both destinations to maintain the profitability of those service. On 25 August 2018, Air India challenged Airbus and Boeing to extend the range of their long haul aircraft to enable flights from India to Santiago or Lima by 2022. The Maharaja Route between New Delhi and Santiago Airport is long, a 20 hour flight at Mach 0.8. Both airframers want to avoid a specific design and Airbus sees a market for 50-100 airliners as other operators could join Air India, for which those could reach the whole world nonstop instead of 70% of its population. Aimed at business travelers, ultra-long-haul flights can charge a 20% premium over one-stop direct flights.  Planned long flights  Iran Air had planned a nonstop Tehran‚ÄìLos Angeles flight, which never materialized due to the 1979 Iranian Revolution. In November 1979, it suspended its scheduled nonstop service between New York and Tehran, flown eastward in 11h 15min, begun after its 747SP delivery on March 12, 1976. Emirates is contemplating a direct Dubai-San Juan flight. It would be the longest nonstop flight to and from the Caribbean with . Philippine Airlines is replacing its A340-300 with an A350-900 HGW, a high gross weight version available from 2017 enabling nonstop Manila-New York connections without payload limitations in both directions, a flight. Qantas introduced a nonstop flight from Perth, Australia to London Heathrow, England with a flight time of 17 hours to travel 14,492 kilometres with Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners in 2018. This was the first regular nonstop flight connection between the continents of Europe and Oceania. In 2019, Qantas also used the same aircraft fleet to debut its first experimental nonstop flights between New York and Sydney (with a distance of more than 16,000 km), and London and Sydney (with a distance of more than 17,000 km), making both routes the two longest flights ever attempted by any modern aircraft in history.

Biography  Born at Xenia, Ohio, she graduated from Monmouth College where she was a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma.The Key of Kappa Kappa Gamma, Vol. 37, p. 289. She taught at Monmouth for a while until she was dismissed by the Board of Trustees for wearing her Kappa Kappa Gamma key.May 1882: The dismissal of Miss Lizzie Gowdy, art instructor She studied at the Cooper Union, Art Students' League, New York School of Art, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, Cowles Art School in Boston; under Frederick Freer, William Chase, and Harry Siddons Mowbray. She medaled at Cooper Union. She was a member of the Boston Art Students' Association and the Art Workers' Club for Women, New York. This artist painted numerous portraits and was especially successful with pictures of children. She had a method of her own, claiming that it was excellent for life-size portraits in watercolors. The paper she used was heavier than any made in the US at the time, and was imported. Her watercolors were very strong. She stated that in this method, she got \\"the strength of oils with the daintiness of water-colors, and that it is beautiful for women and children, and sufficiently strong for portraits of men\\". She rarely exhibited, and her portraits were kept in private houses. Baker demonstrated skill and manipulation of large washes of color. She exhibited aquarelle works at Knoedler's Galleries, including one of Mrs. James S. Clarkson, in which the painting of lace gown, blue scarf, pearls and other accessories demonstrated careful detail work. A less conventional likeness of Mrs. James A. Stillman showed the subject in picturesque gown of iridescent silk draped with scarf of delicate lace. Three portraits were exhibited in the artist's studio in the Tiffany and Company Building, those of Mr. and Mrs. James A. Baker and their daughter, of Houston, Texas. These were admirable examples of the artist's ability to secure a likeness.

Finally Indian started producing their own parts and Aurora then went on to produce their own complete motorcycle known as Thor motorcycles. The agreement between the two companies expired in 1907. Before that time, Thor did not make complete bikes and Indian used the Thor manufactured engines of Hedstrom's design.Bonhams Lot 817 1913 Thor 61ci Model U Twin After the split Thor began to innovate new features and this included the F-head engine, a V-twin engine, and automatic (aka mechanical) valves on the engine. In 1908 Thor achieved automatic intake valves on their engine and offered many typical options for the day. During this time there was options like battery ignition and belt drive. In 1913 Thor offered a Schebler carburetor on its 1200 cc twin.Thor 1916 1000cc 7hp 2 cyl ioe Thor also used updraft carburetors on their engines. In 1916 they offered a 3-speed transmission on their cycle. Another option was an acetylene lamps for light. 1913 Thor Motorcycle 9/28/2011 11:23:07 AM by Christian Williams A Thor motorcycle was used in the 1913 Charlie Chaplin film (18 minutes long) Mabel at the Wheel. Thor stopped making motorcycle engines in 1916, and production dwindled in the late 1910s. In the early 1910s sales began to decline, and one of the factors may have been the rise of the Ford Model T. An example of a Thor product was the Model 13U, which had an overall blue color scheme with white tires and a 7-horsepower twin cylinder internal combustion engine. One of the four surviving Thor Model 13U is at the National Motorcycle Museum in Iowa, USA. Racing Two people on motorized bicycles race on a board track in 1911. Thor hired William Ottaway in 1909, and he led Thor to success in motorcycle racing during his tenure until he left the company in 1913. Ottaway was noted for his ability to tune engines and Thor set national records with Thor bikes.Pioneers of American Motorcycle Racing [small red square] by Daniel K. Statnekov At this time much of the racing was on dirt tracks or tracks of wooden boards, and racing was noted as important for of recognition on the motorcycle market. (see also Board track racing) An example of a Thor racing bike was the 1912 Thor Board Track Racer, which shipped in special Thor box. They were called board track racers because in this day, the racing courses were made of planks of wood to make the race track, hence a 'board track'.The Early, Deadly Days of Motorcycle Racing The wooden tracks were called motordromes and were quite dangerous to drivers and the crowds. Most of the sport's stars died racing and its popularity had diminished by the 1920s according to the Smithsonian Institution. Engines Thor supplied engines to many manufacturers including: *Sears (Sears Roebuck sold via mail- order motorcycles from 1913 to 1916) *Chicago *Reading Standard *Indian (Hendee co) *Torpedo motorcycles Thor also made parts and castings for Flying Merkel, Reading Standard, Henderson Motorcycle, and Harley-Davidson. *Henderson sold motor bikes from 1912 to the end of 1931. *Flying Merkel sold motor bikes from 1911 to 1915. *Sears sold from 1913 to 1916. Models Here is some examples of models offered: *Model 13-M (4 hp single) *Model 13-W (5 hp single) *Model 13-U (7 hp twin) *A two-speed was offered as an option on each of the motorcycles for an extra fee.

These rules were historically kept secret and passed on to the most senior students of a school only near the death of the head of the organisation. Without such a rule set describing how kata are constructed, the likelihood of deciphering the original combative meaning of the movements in the kata is very low. Theory The theory behind Kaisai no genri is that originally kata began as sets of paired drills or \\"sparring sets\\" practised by ancient martial artists. Over time large numbers of these drills became difficult to remember and so the defensive portion of the drills were assembled together into units and became the first kata. It is worth noting that these would probably have been Chinese martial art forms. By the time kata were created in Okinawa, the concept would have been well established. The attacking methods were not recorded in the forms and are therefore unknown. However, they may be inferred from limb and body positioning and preceding and following movements through the process of bunkai or in G≈çj≈´-ry≈´ karate the process of Kaisai. It has been theorised by Seikichi Toguchi Sensei and copy by :Patrick McCarthy that the drills and defensive routines recorded were responses to Habitual Acts of Physical Violence (HAPV Theory). The rule set The rule set is broken down into three basic rules and nine advanced rules. Shuyo san gensoko - Three basic rules # Don't be deceived by the shape (embusen) of the kata. #: The kata embusen is designed to allow the kata to be performed within a small space. The shape of the embusen has no bearing on the meaning of the techniques in the kata. # Techniques executed while advancing are offensive. Those executed while retreating are defensive. # There is only one opponent and he is in front of you. #: Turning to face a new direction while performing the kata does not mean you are turning to face a new opponent. Hosoku joko - Advanced rules # Every movement in kata is significant and is to be used in application. #: There are no \\"salutation\\", religious or empty movements in kata. All movements in the kata have meaning. # A closed pulling hand returning to chamber usually has some part of the opponent in it. #: When pulling a hand to the chamber position, particularly if it is closed, it should be considered to have some part of the opponent in its grip. e.g. an arm, wrist or even head. # Utilize the shortest distance to your opponent. #: The kata will typically attack the opponent with the closest part of your body. # If you control an opponent‚Äôs head you control the opponent. #: Kata techniques often target Kyusho (vital or weak points of the body), many of the most important of these are in the head. e.g. eyes or throat. # There are no blocks. #: Uke are not blocks, they are \\"defences\\", however in kata they may not even represent defences, but simply be the movements of the limbs required to execute a more complex technique like a throw. # Angles in kata are very important. #: The angle to which you turn represents the angle which you must take relative to the opponent for the technique to work. It does not represent turning to face a new opponent. # Touching your own body in kata indicates that you are touching part of your opponent. #: In the absence of a partner to practice with, where the kata touches your own body, you would be touching or holding part of the opponent's body. # Don't attack hard parts of your opponent with hard parts of your body. #: The kata typically strikes hard parts of the opponent with soft parts of your body and soft parts with hard parts of your body. # There are no pauses in the application. #: The rhythm of the performance of kata has no bearing on the performance of the techniques extracted from it. Rule sets used by other karate masters Kenwa Mabuni In his book Kobo Kenpo Karatedo Nyumon, Shit≈ç-ry≈´ karate master Kenwa Mabuni wrote that when kata change direction, the angle turned to does not indicate turning to face additional attackers, but instead indicates the angle taken with respect to a single opponent attacking from the front.

He played an important role in the first years of the period known as the Anarchy at Samarra, during which he rapidly became one of the most powerful officials in the government. He was appointed as vizier upon the caliph al-Musta'in's ascension in 862, but was assassinated after approximately a year in office.  Biography  Utamish was born in Iraq, the son of a man named Khatrakin; he may also have been a nephew of Bugha al- Kabir. He appears during the reign of al-Wathiq (r. 842‚Äì847) as one of the caliph's ghilman. At some point he was attached to the service of al-Muntasir, the eldest son and heir of al-Mutawakkil (r. 847‚Äì861). Utamish eventually established a strong relationship with the young prince, and was known as \\"sahib al-Muntasir.\\" According to al-Mas'udi, Utamish was instrumental in al- Muntasir's attempts to win over the loyalty of the Turks in the army, a move which caused hostility between al-Mutawakkil and al-Muntasir. Al-Ya'qubi states that Utamish was one of the officers who assassinated al-Mutawakkil in December 861, although this is not verified by other accounts of the incident. In any case, al-Mutawwakil's killing resulted in al-Muntasir becoming caliph; during his short reign (861‚Äì862), Utamish and the vizier Ahmad ibn al-Khasib were among the most prominent men in his government. Following al-Muntasir's death in June 862, Utamish and the officers Bugha al-Kabir and Bugha al- Sharabi met to select a new caliph, eventually deciding on al-Musta'in (r. 862‚Äì866), a grandson of al-Mu'tasim. Utamish seems to have held a strong influence on al-Musta'in and became one of the most powerful individuals in the new administration; he was appointed as vizier and given control over the treasury, and additionally received the governorships of Egypt and the Maghrib. Al-Musta'in further entrusted him with the supervision of his son al-'Abbas. Over the course of the first year of al-Musta'in's reign, Utamish enjoyed full control over the caliph and his affairs; in the opinion of the historian Dominique Sourdel, he was \\"un v√©ritable r√©gent de l'empire.\\" As vizier, he seems to have managed little of the day-to-day administration, leaving his secretary Shuja' ibn al-Qasim to handle it instead. Utamish and Shuja' seem to have initially shared power with Ahmad ibn al-Khasib, until the latter was exiled in July 862. Utamish's dominance over the government soon caused him to make enemies in the army and bureaucracy. He and several other officials stole from the treasury, which caused discontent among the poorly- paid mawlas. Utamish also excluded the influential officers Bugha al-Sharabi and Wasif al-Turki from power, and the two retaliated by plotting his downfall. On June 4, 863, the Turks and Faraghina marched out from their cantonments in Samarra and advanced toward the Jawsaq Palace against Utamish. The vizier attempted to seek refuge with al-Musta'in but was refused; two days later, the troops entered the palace and seized Utamish. He and Shuja' were killed and Utamish's residence was plundered.

History  CAUFA was founded in 1919 in the foyer of the Civil Union Franco-American Reims (7 Peace Boulevard became the CRDP Reims). In 1915, Emmanuel Sautter, a French general secretary of the National Alliance of YMCAs / YMCA of France from 1895 to 1910 and the World Alliance of YMCAs / YMCA from 1910 to 1915, founded the home of the soldier, funded by the American YMCA (Protestant youth movement at the origin of basketball in 1893). The association took the company name of the Franco-American Union in honor of the American patrons. In 1919, the association introduced basketball. In the 1930s, the male and female teams were at the top of the poster of French basketball. In 1939 the section was mothballed, war approached and the buildings were requisitioned. In 1942, the club attempted recovery and became a sports structure. In 1949, the basketball section merged and came under the control of the Stade Reims but, for lack of funds, the activity stopped immediately and the club closed.

He was a former slave of the artist Charles Willson Peale. Early life, slavery, and education Moses Williams was born in 1777 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Scarborough and Lucy Peale, who were slaves in the home of renowned artist and museum-owner Charles Willson Peale.DuBois Shaw, Gwendolyn , American Philosophical Society, Retrieved 28 March 2015. It is believed that Williams' parents began to work for Peale sometime between 1769 and 1775. In 1786, Peale emancipated Williams' parents, and Williams' father Scarborough changed his name to John Williams, passing along his new last name to his son. Although Williams' parents were freed, the law mandated that nine-year-old Moses remain in Peale's service until his twenty-seventh birthday and so Williams grew up in the Peale household among Peale's many artistic children, including Rembrandt Peale, Raphaelle Peale, Franklin Peale and Titian Ramsay Peale. Silhouette maker Growing up in the Peale household, Williams was instructed in skills that would help him to work at Peale's Museum, including taxidermy, object display, and silhouette-making. As a slave, he was not taught the \\"higher art\\" of painting. After showing skill at silhouette-making, Williams was given a physionotrace machine to make silhouettes and he continued to work at Peale's Museum as a freed man and a professional silhouettist, making black-and-white paper silhouettes for visitors of the museum. Williams also created silhouettes of the Peale family, including Charles Willson Peale and his wife Elizabeth.Farago, Jason. \\"Represent: 200 Years of African American Art review\\", The Guardian, Retrieved 28 March 2015.

It is at the corner of Lever Street and Central Street, and shares in King Square Gardens to the west. It is two green courtyards, one of a semi-private nature hemmed in by mid-rise blocks at the corner of Lever Street and Central Street; and King Square Gardens which takes the only street named as the 'Square', namely as its east side, and uses Lever Street and part of Goswell Road (designated part of the A1) for its other sides. Surroundings The square is surrounded by restaurants, cafeterias, a newsagent's, a florist shop, a pub and somewhat modernist, mid-rise housing. 19th century St Clement's Church stands in the corner of the square. On the other side of Central Street stands Thistle City Barbican Hotel. History The square originally lined with spacious housing for wealthy Londoners to live in a convenient distance from the City was laid out between 1822 and 1825 on land belonging to St Bartholomew's Hospital. It was named after King George IV, the ex-Prince Regent and constitutional monarch of the British Empire. In 1824 the construction of a church at the square (then called St Barnabas) was completed. During Victorian times, the social composition of the area changed and the housing was occupied mostly by poorer Londoners, with houses divided into smaller flats. The area now occupied by the square was badly damaged during the Blitz and the houses were demolished in the 1950s. In 1959 Finsbury Borough Council ordered the construction of the King Square Estate surrounding the square; work was completed in 1965. The estate was designed by Emberton, Franck and Tardrew and built from pre-cast concrete. Turnpike House, the tallest tower was completed in 1965; it stands to the west of King Square Gardens, with a ground-level arch providing entrance to the park. President House, a collection of six-storey blocks, was built to the north of the park. Transport The nearest bus stops are located on the nearby Goswell Road (London Bus routes 4 and 56) as well as City Road (route 43). The square is approximately 10 minutes walk from Angel, Barbican, and Old Street tube stations, and 12 minutes from Farringdon station.

The author of six books and over seventy scholarly articles, review essays, and book chapters, she has published on literary theory, academic politics, US proletarian literature, the Harlem Renaissance, and the writers Ralph Ellison and Jean Toomer. Throughout her career, her work has emphasized the centrality of antiracism and Marxist class analysis to both literary study and social movements. Life Born in New York City, Foley attended Radcliffe College from 1965‚Äì69, graduating Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude; she earned her Ph.D. with Honors from the University of Chicago in 1976. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, in the antiwar, antiracist, and feminist movements, she began what became an extended involvement with left-wing politics. She taught at the University of Wisconsin from 1976‚Äì80 and at Northwestern University from 1980-87. She was denied tenure by the Provost at Northwestern University on the grounds of ‚Äúgrave professional misconduct‚Äù‚Äîstemming from her participation in a 1985 campus demonstration against Adolfo Calero, a Nicaraguan contra leader- even though she had been approved for tenure by her department, the A&P; Committee, and the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. In 1987, the Modern Language Association (MLA) passed a resolution appealing to NU's President Arnold Weber to overrule the Provost's decision and grant tenure to Foley. Since 1987 Foley has been on the faculty at Rutgers University-Newark. Foley has been the recipient of awards for both teaching and scholar-activism at Rutgers University-Newark, as well of fellowships from the National Endowment for the HumanitiesNational Endowment for the Humanities and the American Council of Learned Societies.American Council of Learned Societies Foley was elected to the MLA Delegate Assembly four times, for a total of twelve years, as representative of Politics and the Profession; she served as the President of the MLA Radical Caucus from 2005 to 2017.Modern Language Association Since 2000 she has been on the Editorial Board and Manuscript Committee at the Marxist journal Science & Society, where she is currently Vice-President.Science and Society She has lectured on American literature and Marxist theory in France and Cuba, as well as during four trips to China, where several of her works have been translated into Chinese. Since 1990 she has served as Chair of the National Organization for Women-NJ Task Force on Combating Racism.National Organization For Women of New Jersey Work Foley's first book, Telling the Truth: The Theory and Practice of Documentary Fiction (Cornell University Press, 1986), is a Marxist commentary on texts combining fact and fiction. Taking issue with post-structuralist and reader-response theories of discourse, Foley argues that fiction contains propositional content; she offers a historical materialist overview of the novel's changing modes of conveying cognition of the world beyond the text. Telling the Truth was described in a review in Modern Philology as proposing \\"a powerful theory for dealing with the assertions made by fictional texts. . . This is one of those rare books that will change the very way we think about literature.\\" Radical Representations: Politics and Form in US Proletarian Fiction, 1929-1941 (Duke, 1993) reflects Foley‚Äôs interest in Depression-era literary radicalism. Arguing against the Cold War paradigms that continue to shape scholarship on left-wing writing, Foley examines contemporaneous debates over art and propaganda, investigates the relationship between left politics and literary form, and proposes an anatomy of the modes of proletarian fiction. The reviewer for MELUS wrote that Foley \\"has written a superbly researched and argued book . . . that is a must read for anyone interested in gaining a better understanding of the difficult project of creating a radical culture sensitive to issues of race, class and gender in the effort to build an egalitarian society.\\" Foley's third book, Spectres of 1919: Class and Nation in the Making of the New Negro (Illinois, 2003), explores the radical origins of the Harlem Renaissance. Alain Locke's formulation of the New Negro as culture hero in his influential 1925 The New Negro: An Interpretation, Foley argues, was premised upon banishing the figure of the New Negro as social revolutionary that prevailed in the late 1910s and early 1920s. The reviewer for American Literature designated Spectres of 1919 \\"a carefully argued, nuanced presentation of the genesis of the Harlem Renaissance. Foley's breadth of knowledge in American radical history is impressive.\\" In the Journal of American Studies, the book was described as \\"lucid and useful. . . . A heavyweight intervention, it prompts significant rethinking of the ideological and representational strategies structuring the era.\\" In Wrestling with the Left: The Making of Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man (Duke, 2010), Foley shifts the focus of her scholarship onto a detailed engagement with a single text. Here, she undertakes a reconstruction of the process by which Ellison composed his novel between 1945 and 1952. Her investigation of the thousands of pages of draft manuscript and notes yields the conclusion that the novel familiar to readers was the product of multiple reconceptualizations and revisions. Now viewed as a Cold War classic, Invisible Man was begun, she proposes, as a proletarian novel somewhat sympathetic with the left. The assessment appearing in African American Review asserted, \\"After Foley‚Äôs analysis of the material in Ellison's drafts, one in fact gains an even greater appreciation for the richness and complexity of what remains one of the great works of American literature.\\" The reviewer of Wrestling with the Left for Cultural Logic, noting Foley's treatment of politics and form, concluded that \\"Foley challenges not only prevailing views of Ellison and Invisible Man, and not only dominant views of early-to-mid-20th century U.S. history involving the Communist left (literary and otherwise), but. . . dominant conceptions of 'literature' and 'literary greatness' as such.\\" Foley's 2014 book, Jean Toomer: Race, Repression, and Revolution (Illinois, 2014), displays her growing interest in biography as a necessary component of Marxist criticism. Invoking hitherto unexplored portions of the Toomer archive and expanding upon Fredric Jameson‚Äôs formulation of the political unconscious, Foley offers a new approach to both Toomer the man and Cane the book. Nathan Grant, Toomer scholar and editor of African American Review, has written, ‚ÄúBarbara Foley‚Äôs contribution to Toomer studies newly places him in the contexts of both early twentieth-century Left politics and ‚ÄòNew Negro‚Äô sensibility. Any assessment of the Harlem Renaissance is made all the richer by Foley‚Äôs study, with which subsequent scholarship must contend.\\" According to Charles Scruggs, co-author of Jean Toomer and the Terrors of American History (1998), \\"Barbara Foley has written a brilliant book on Toomer. I would go so far to say it is also the best researched book on Toomer that exists.\\" In Marxist Literary Criticism Today, Foley focuses on matters of pedagogy. Although the ability of capitalism to meet the needs of the majority of the world's people is being increasingly called into question, and many people look to literature for insight into the relationship between consciousness and material reality, there have been no general introductions to Marxist literary criticism since the books published by Terry Eagleton (Marxism and Literary Criticism) and Raymond Williams (Marxism and Literature) in the late 1970s. Filling this gap with a study attuned to the concerns of the twenty-first century, Foley lays out the key principles of Marxist theory (historical materialism, political economy, and ideology critique) essential to the study of literature. After examining the ways in which Marxist criticism both overlaps with and differs from other analytical approaches, Foley outlines principal debates that continue to shape the field of Marxist criticism. The book culminates in an extended study of a wide range of literary works‚Äîfrom the poetry of Matthew Arnold to E. L. James's Fifty Shades of Grey to the proletarian verse of Langston Hughes‚Äîthat illustrate Marxism's distinct contribution to an understanding of the connections between literature and society. Foley's book-length studies have been accompanied over the years by a series of articles and anthology contributions that exhibit her concerns as both a scholar and an activist. Her attention to developments in China is reflected in critical analyses of politics and economics appearing in Science & Society and Cultural Logic. Articles appearing in such journals as Science & Society, Mediations, Biography (journal), Rethinking Marxism, Cultural Logic, Cultural Critique, Genre, American Quarterly, and Comparative Literature display her participation in debates over Post-structuralism, Deconstruction, Marxist theory, Intersectionality, and the connections between race and class. Her engagement with politics and the profession is reflected in several interviews‚Äîappearing in Dialogues on Cultural Studies, Reconstruction, Workplace, minnesota review, and Mediations‚Äîas well as in symposia and review essays featured in World Bank Literature, Contemporary Literature, New England Quarterly, and College Literature. Throughout her career, her interest in situating a range of US writers in political and historical context has resulted in readings appearing in such journals as African American Review, Obsidian, Cultural Logic, American Literature, Modern Fiction Studies, PMLA, Genre, and College Literature.

Weidenfeld & Nicolson) Jerusalem the Golden is a novel by Margaret Drabble published in 1967, and is a winner of the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1967.Stevenson, Randall (2004).The Oxford English Literary History: Volume 12: The Last of England?, p. 541. Oxford University Press. Development and title Jerusalem the Golden resembles a number of autobiographical elements: like Clara, Drabble grew up in Yorkshire, was the middle of three sisters, and some of the characters resemble family members. Mrs Maugham is \\"based on [Drabble's] maternal grandmother.\\" The title is taken from the hymn of the same name; frequently Drabble uses titles that point towards Biblical references: such as in The Millstone and The Needle's Eye. Characters *Clara Maugham - the main character for the novel. Clara is a young intelligent, attractive and bright student in her final year at a London university. *Clelia - an artist and actress whom Clara envies and wants to emulate. *Mrs. Maugham - Clara's \\"miserable\\" mother, loosely \\"based on [Drabble's] maternal grandmother.\\" Critic Lisa Allardice attributes the mean personality to a \\"pinched interior life\\". Themes Like many of Drabble's other novels, the novel focuses on topics relevant to women and gender. For example, G. Suchita describes the novel as exhibiting \\"liberationist tendencies\\" familiar with the feminist trends of 1960's. Suchita compares the female protagonist, Clara, to other women characters Emma from The Garrick Year and Louise from A Summer Bird-Cage, both which use \\"sex as a social advancement\\", creating power over men through sexual conquest. However, as critic Lisa Allardice noted she isn't writing \\"feminist\\" novels, but \\"merely writing about the world around her, and her own experiences as a young woman during the period\\". Similarly, in reviewing the novel for the Guardian, critic Lisa Allardice noted the importance of intense female relationships, in a format similar to other novels by Drabble, including her earlier novels: debut novel A Summer Bird-Cage and The Waterfall. Intertextuality Drabble writes the novel into the larger literary tradition, by evoking motifs and features from numerous other works. The title is a biblical reference, and she \\"frequently evokes\\" Thomas Hardy, making explicit references to Tess of the D'Urbervilles. When reviewing the book, critic Lisa Allardice also notes the close resemblance of the novel's structure and plot to the later An Experiment in Love by Hilary Mantel. Critical reception In rereading the novel at the time of its republication with Penguin Modern Classics, critic Lisa Allardice described the novel as \\" very much a fairytale of its time\\". Allardice described the novel as successful, and exhibiting the \\"moral ambiguity and wisdom of Drabble's early fiction, along with the wit and elegance of her prose.\\" She concluded by claiming that it should be as well read as its predecessor, The Millstone.

She was a part of the first wave of Mexican feminism and established the \\"Mujeres de la raza\\" (Women of the [Hispanic] Race) and the International League of Iberian and Latin American Women in co-operation with G. Sof√≠a Villa de Buentello. Biography Elena Arizmendi Mej√≠a was born 18 January 1884 in Mexico City to Jes√∫s Arizmendi and Isabel Mej√≠a, a family of privilege. She was the granddaughter of who served as Secretary of War, and was a Division General under the regime of President Benito Ju√°rez. Her great- grandfather was Lieutenant Colonel Manuel Crist√≥bal Mej√≠a, who fought in the Mexican War of Independence in the army of Agust√≠n de Iturbide. Arizmendi spent some of her early years with her grandfather in Oaxaca and then returned to Mexico City at about the age of 8. She was schooled in Mexico City, possibly at San Ignacio de Loyola, but when her mother died in 1898, Arizmendi took control of her siblings and the household. When her father remarried in 1900, Arizmendi hastily entered marriage with Francisco Carreto, but the union quickly crumbled and she decided to study nursing. Her family had close ties with Francisco I. Madero and the school in which Arizmendi was enrolled was next door to Madero's Texas retreat. In 1910, she was studying at the School of Nursing of the Santa Rosa Hospital (now the School of Nursing at the University of the Incarnate Word) in San Antonio, Texas when the war broke out. On 17 April 1911, a few weeks prior to her graduation, Arizmendi returned via train to Mexico City to help with wounded combatants, as the Mexican Red Cross refused to provide aid to insurgents. Arizmendi arranged a personal meeting with the head of the Red Cross, who reiterated the refusal to support revolutionaries. Determined to help her countrymen, Arizmendi founded an organization to help and with her brother Carlos rallied medical students and nurses to organise the Cruz Blanca Neutral (Neutral White Cross). Elena Arizmendi and volunteers of the Neutral White Cross, 1911 They formed an association under the guidelines of the Geneva Conventions and she became the fundraiser, enlisting the help of celebrities like Mar√≠a Conesa, Virginia F√°bregas, and Leopoldo Berist√°in. After numerous fundraisers, they collected sufficient funds for a field hospital and on 11 May 1911, set off for Ciudad Ju√°rez. Arizmendi and Carlos, formed the first brigade with Dr. Ignacio Barrios and Dr. Antonio M√°rquez and nurses Mar√≠a Avon, Juana Flores Gallardo, Atilana Garc√≠a, Elena de Lange, and Tomasa Villareal. The second brigade, led by Dr. Francisco, left the following day and on the 14th a third brigade, headed by Dr. Lorenzo and ten nurses including Innocenta D√≠az, Concepci√≥n Ib√°√±ez, Jovita Mu√±iz, Concepci√≥n S√°nchez, Mar√≠a S√°nchez, Basilia V√©lez, Mar√≠a V√©lez and Antonia Zorilla. Arriving in Ju√°rez, they found devastation and again Arizmendi had to rally for funds. By the end of 1911, the Neutral White Cross had established 25 brigades across Mexico. Arzimendi was elected as the first woman partner of the Sociedad Mexicana de Geograf√≠a y Estad√≠stica, but she rejected the honour. She did accept a gold medal presented to her for dedication with helping the wounded by the Gran Liga Obrera (Grand Worker League). Arizmundi was both revered for her philanthropy and disliked for her leadership, at a time when women were expected to be docile and submissive. There were attacks to her leadership of the White Cross, such as when she had a photograph taken as a joke with the revolutionary crossed cartridge belts of male soldiers and soldaderas and was accused of violating the neutrality of the health organisation. During the revolutionary era, she had a long-term affair with Jos√© Vasconcelos, who was married with two children; she has been described as \\"the first of many lovers in his life but certainly his most intense and madly beloved liaison.\\"Enrique Krauze, Redeemers: Ideas and Power in Latin America, New York: Harper Collins 2011, p. 55. Arizmundi fled Mexico in 1915 for the United States, briefly taking refuge in a convent in Victoria, Texas to hide from the public scandal of her relationship with Vasconcelos. She soon made her way to New York City, where the relationship ended. According to one scholar, Arizmendi accompanied Vasconcelos to Lima, Peru and she broke off the relationship as he prepared to return to Mexico.Krauze, Redeemer, p. 57. He wrote about her in his autobiography, La Tormenta, giving her the pseudonym \\"Adriana.\\" According to historian Enrique Krauze, Vasconcelos's description of the relationship \\"is the most famous depiction of 'mad love' in Mexican literature.\\"Krauze, Redeemers, p. 57. When Arizmendi was in New York, Vasconcelos attempted an unsuccessful reconciliation with her.Krauze, Redeemers, p. 61. Surrounded by feminists in New York, she recognised the Anglo-oriented perspective of European and US feminists. Wishing to give a voice to Latina women, she founded a feminist magazine, Feminismo Internacional (International Feminist) and began publishing articles reflecting Hispanic versions of feminism. She also co-founded with G. Sof√≠a Villa de Buentello a co-operative union \\"Mujeres de la raza\\" (Women of the [Hispanic] Race) in 1923 with aims of uniting Latina women in the struggle for rights. At the time, Latin America was seen as the next \\"staging ground\\", as suffrage had been gained in Europe and the US. Arizmendi, after her attendance at the 1922 Pan-American Conference of Women, understood Europeans and Americans did not grasp the cultural realities of Hispanic women. Villa and Arizmendi both saw matrimony and motherhood, an integral part of Latina identity, as making the experience of women \\"complete\\". Arizmendi also saw the anti-clerical movement of the post-Revolutionary governments as an attack on a central part of her Mexican identity. Arizmendi and Villa planned a conference for the Mujeres de la raza funded by the International League of Iberian and Latin American Women. Arizmendi used her press contracts and secured coverage in The New York Times to promote the event. On 2 March 1924, an extensive article about the feminist movement in Mexico entitled \\"New Women of Mexico Striving for Equality\\" carried an interview with Villa de Buentello giving an overview of their goals. The meeting occurred in July, 1925 in Mexico City with Villa as President of the conference. Arizmendi served as Secretary General, but did not attend due to a difference of opinion with Villa. In 1927, Arizmendi published an autobiography with the purpose of airing her side of the affair and silencing rumors about her public life. Since Vasconcelos had published two works, Ulises Criollo and La Tormenta vilifying Arizmendi, though as a fictionalised character, Arizmendi's autobiography is a reflection upon the \\"double standard\\" women encountered. For the 25th commemoration of the organization of the White Cross in 1936 and partly because President L√°zaro C√°rdenas supported suffrage, Arizmendi returned briefly to Mexico. She returned to New York, but moved permanently back to Mexico City in 1938, where she died in 1949.

Biography Bayard was, according to Bale, a Dominican theologian at Oxford, where he obtained his doctor's degree. Pits's account tends in the same direction, and both biographers praise their author for his knowledge of pontifical law. Bale adds that he was very skilled for his age in Aristotelian studies, but accuses him of distorting the Scriptures by \\"allegorical inventions and leisurely quibbles.\\" Bayard's principal work appears to have been entitled \\"Distinctiones Theologi√¶,\\" and, according to the last-mentioned authority, this book was largely calculated to corrupt the simplicity of the true faith, as it consisted, like Abelard's \\"Sic et Non,\\" of an assortment of theological opinions opposed to one another. A manuscript of this work is still preserved in Merton College library, and Tanner gives a list of other writings of this author that are to be found in English libraries. The date assigned to Nicholas Bayard by his English biographers is about 1410; but this can hardly be correct if Mr. Coxe is right in assigning the handwriting of the Merton manuscript to the previous century. The whole question of the era in which this writer lived, and his nationality, is minutely discussed by Qu√©tif in his \\"Scriptores Ordinis Pr√¶dicatorum,\\" who inclines to believe that Bayard was a Frenchman of the thirteenth century. This, according to Qu√©tif, is the opinion of an ancient French writer, Bernard Guido. Qu√©tif also shows how, in the collections of that age, preserved up to his days in the Sorbonne, Bayard's sermons constantly occurred in company with those of William of Auvergne, bishop of Paris (1228‚Äì48), and other great characters of Louis IX's reign. More conclusive as to the date is Qu√©tif's assertion that in the \\"Liber Rectoris Universitatis Parisiensis\\" Bayard's great work is mentioned as being for sale in Paris before the year 1303; that several other discourses of Bayard were for sale in Paris at the same time; and that his \\"Sermones Dominicales\\" formed part of a parchment folio in the Sorbonne library, containing Robert de Sorbonne's \\"Liber de Conscienti√¢\\". Qu√©tif does not, however, adduce any indubitable evidence that Bayard was a Frenchman. But if he was the writer of the \\"Summa de Abstinentia,\\" which Qu√©tif unhesitatingly assigns to him, and does really, as Qu√©tif asserts, mingle French words with the Latin text, the fact of his French residence, if not of his French birth, may perhaps be considered as proved. Lastly, as regards the order to which Bayard belonged, Qu√©tif observes that there is no certain evidence whether he was a Franciscan or a Dominican. In all the manuscripts excepting one he appears to be called simply Frater Nicholas de Bayard, and in the only one which is more precise he is called a Minorite. Only one of Bayard's works seems to have been printed, and that one of somewhat doubtful authenticity, the \\"Summa de Abstinentia,\\" which was published under the title of \\"Dictionarius Pauperum\\" by John Knoblouch at Cologne in 1518, and again at Paris in 1530.

Prehistory and exploration The site at the confluence of the Arkansas and Little Arkansas Rivers has served as a trading center and meeting place for nomadic hunting people for at least 11,000 years. Human habitation in the Wichita area has been dated, in archeological digs, as far back as 3,000 B.C. The area was visited by Francisco V√°squez de Coronado in 1541, while he was in search of the fabulous \\"cities of gold\\". While there, he encountered a group of Native Americans whom he called Quiviras and who have been identified by archaeological and historical studies as the Wichita. By 1719, these people had moved south to Oklahoma, where they met French traders. The first permanent settlement in Wichita was a collection of grass houses inhabited by the Wichita tribe in 1864. They had moved back to Wichita from Oklahoma during the American Civil War because of their support for the Union. Cowtown: Pioneer traders and boosters Pioneer trader Jesse Chisholm, a half-white, half-Native American who was illiterate but who spoke multiple Native American languages, established a trading post at the site in the 1860s, and Chisholm traded cattle and goods with the Wichita tribe at points south along a trail from Wichita into present-day Oklahoma (and eventually into Texas) that became known as the Chisholm Trail, which soon became legendary in Western lore. Chisholm was soon eclipsed in the area by three astute businessmen: commercial buffalo hunters and traders James R. Mead (of Iowa), William Greiffenstein (a German immigrant merchant), and Buffalo Bill Mathewson (not to be confused with Buffalo Bill Cody); these men led the initial commercial development of the area, becoming key landowners of what became the city of Wichita.Howell, Angela and Peg Vines, The Insider's Guide to Wichita, Wichita Eagle & Beacon Publishing, Wichita, KS, 1995 1915 railroad map of Sedgwick County Hunters, farmers and Native Americans in the area all turned to the newborn tiny settlement as a principal trading center for the area, while Wichita's entrepreneurs began an aggressive sales campaign to lure more settlers (their future customers and tenants) to the area, with the \\"boosterism\\" typical of successful early prairie settlements. The city, on the east bank of the Arkansas River, was officially incorporated in 1870. Among the signatories on the town charter was a lone woman, the town laundry operator, Catherine \\"The Widow\\" McCarty, whose elder teenage son, after leaving Wichita, would become the infamous gunman, Billy the Kid. Wichita's position on the Chisholm Trail made it a destination for cattle drives headed north to access railroads to eastern markets. The Chisholm Trail ran along the east side of the community from 1867 to 1871. In late 1872 the Wichita and Southwestern Railroad completed a 27-mile branch line from Wichita to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway at Newton. As a result, Wichita became a railhead for cattle drives from Texas and other south-western points, from which it has derived its nickname \\"Cowtown.\\" Wichita's neighboring town on the opposite (west) bank of the Arkansas River, Delano, a village of saloons and brothels, had a particular reputation for lawlessness, largely accommodating the rough, visiting cattlemen. The Wichita/Delano community gained a wild reputation, however, the east (Wichita) side of the river was kept more civil, thanks to numerous well-known lawmen who passed through, employed to help keep the rowdy cowboys in line. Among those was Wyatt Earp.Miner, Prof. Craig (Wichita State Univ. Dept. of History), Wichita: The Magic City, Wichita Historical Museum Assn., Wichita, KS, 1988 Following the incorporation of the city in 1870, rapid immigration resulted in a land boom involving speculation into the late 1880s. Wichita annexed Delano in 1880. By 1890, Wichita had become the third- largest city in the state (behind Kansas City and Topeka), with a population of nearly 24,000. After the boom the city suffered from 15 years of comparative depression and slow growth. Wichita reached national fame in 1900 when Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) member Carrie Nation decided to carry her crusade against alcohol to Wichita. On December 27 of that year she entered the Carey House bar in downtown Wichita and smashed the place with a rock and a pool ball. Although she had visited all the bars in Wichita the night before, demanding that they close their doors, the John Noble painting Cleopatra at the Roman Bath in the Carey House had drawn her particular wrath. An island in the middle of the Arkansas River, named Ackerman Island, was home to an amusement park and a dance pavilion. The island was connected to the West Bank of the river through a Work Projects Administration (WPA) project in the 1930s. Oil boom In 1914-1915 oil and gas were first discovered in nearby Butler county. These discoveries form part of the vast Mid-Continent oil province. Several local producers established headquarters, refineries, and retail outlets, in Wichita as it was the nearest large city. Archibald L. Derby (1875-1956) participated in oil booms in Southeast Kansas, Oklahoma, and in 1916 he drilled a successful well in Butler county. He went on to found Derby Oil Company that owned a refinery in Wichita at 21st and Washington Street. and had gas stations throughout the region. In 1955 Derby Oil was acquired by Colorado Oil & Gas, a subsidiary of Colorado Interstate Gas, which became part of Coastal Corporation in 1973. John (Jack) Vickers (1891-1940) was another Wichita oil mogul who got his start in the Butler oil fields. Founder of Vickers Petroleum, in 1920, he built a refinery in Potwin Kansas about 20 miles northeast of Wichita. In 1934, at 8500 E Central, he built one of the largest mansions (named Vickridge) seen in Kansas up to that time. In 1961 the estate became the new site for the Kapaun Mt. Carmel High School. Barnsdall Refinery (1941) By 1917 there were 5 refineries operating in Wichita. Seven more were built in the 1920s. But only 3 were still operating at the end of that decade. The Coastal-Derby refinery was the last to close in 1993 with none remaining thru 2010. It was demolished in 2004. In 1925 Fred C. Koch, a chemical engineer, joined a fellow MIT classmate, P.C. Keith, at Keith-Winkler Engineering in Wichita. Following the departure of Keith in 1925, the firm became Winkler-Koch Engineering Company. In 1927, Koch developed a more efficient thermal cracking process for turning crude oil into gasoline which allowed smaller players in the industry to better compete with the oil majors. The larger oil companies quickly sued in response, filing 44 different lawsuits against Koch, and embroiling him in litigation for years. Koch was to prevail in all but one of the suits (which was later over-turned due to the fact that the judge had been bribed). This extended litigation effectively put Winkler-Koch out of business in the U.S. for several years. Koch turned his focus to foreign markets, including the Soviet Union, where Winkler-Koch built 15 cracking units between 1929 and 1932. Koch and his family would go on to become the wealthiest residents of both Wichita and the state of Kansas. \\"The Air Capital of the World\\" Stearman (Boeing) Model 75 trainer aircraft were built during the 1930s and 1940s. Boeing B-29 assembly line in 1944 B-29 Superfortress delivery ceremony at Boeing in February 1945 B-47A Stratojet at Boeing plant in January 1951 Beechcraft Starship were built from 1983 to 1995. Wichita's principal industry is aircraft manufacturing, as it has been for several decades. The city claims the title \\"Air Capital of the World\\" based on having produced more aircraft than any other city, anywhere‚Äîan estimated over 250,000 aircraft in the last 100 years. The city produces approximately one-fifth of U.S. civilian aircraft, and has generally been the world leader in the production of light aircraft and business jets, in addition to substantial production of military and commercial aircraft, and their subassemblies, and related products.Tanner, Beccy, \\"Wichita aviation started 100 years ago Sept. 1,\\" September 1, 2016, Wichita Eagle retrieved August 8, 2017Tanner, Beccy, \\"Dreamers fuel Kansas' legacy of flight,\\" September 18, 2011, Wichita Eagle retrieved August 8, 2017Rowe, Frank J.

The aircraft manufacturers Laird, Swallow, Travel Air, Stearman, Cessna, Mooney, and Beechcraft were all founded in Wichita in the 1920s and early 1930s‚Äîleading to the city's rise to the nation's highest-volume producer of aircraft by 1929. Under those companies, and subsequently with added aircraft factories of Boeing, Learjet, Bombardier Aerospace, Raytheon, Culver, Belite, and others, Wichita eventually produced over a quarter-million aircraft, and aircraft manufacturing remains its principal industry today.Harris, Richard, \\"The Air Capital Story: Early General Aviation & Its Manufacturers\\", reprinted from In Flight USA magazine on author's own website, 2002/2003Bissionette, Bruce, The Wichita 4: Cessna, Moellendick, Beech & Stearman, (from interviews with Matty Laird, Lloyd Stearman, Olive Ann Beech, Dwayne Wallace, Rawdon, Burnham, and other principals), Aviation Heritage Books, Destin, FL, 1999.Sulzberger, A. G. in \\"Boeing Departure Shakes Wichita‚Äôs Identity as Airplane Capital,\\" January 18, 2012, New York Times retrieved August 8, 2017 In 1914 and 1915, oil was discovered nearby and Wichita became a major oil center. The money derived from oil allowed local entrepreneurs to invest in a nascent airplane industry. In 1917 the Cessna Comet became the first aircraft to be built in Wichita. Phillips, Edward H., Travel Air: Wings over the Prairie,' revised ed ., Flying Books International, 1982/1994, Eagan MN (coverage of Laird/Swallow, Travel Air and early careers of Cessna, Stearman & Beech) In 1920, oilmen Jacob M. \\"Jake\\" Mollendick and Billy Burke invited young Chicago barnstormer and aircraft builder Emil Matthew \\"Matty\\" Laird to come to Wichita to build his new airplane design, backed by their money. The Laird Swallow became an instant success, the first successful \\"commercial\\" airplane manufactured in the United States; Laird built 43 of them between 1920 and 1923. When Matty Laird returned to Chicago, the Wichita enterprise was renamed Swallow Airplane Company. Lloyd Stearman and Walter Beech were both employees of the Swallow Company, but in January 1925 they left Swallow and teamed up with Clyde Cessna to form Travel Air, whose airplanes soon outsold Swallow's. Stearman left Travel Air in 1926 to start Stearman Aircraft in Venice, California, and Cessna quit in January 1927 to start Cessna Aircraft Company in Wichita. In 1927, Stearman relocated his factory back to Wichita. By 1929, at least a dozen more Wichita aircraft manufacturers arose (most producing small‚Äîeven singular‚Äîquantities of aircraft). In 1927, ground on the southeast side of town was purchased to use as the site for the Wichita Municipal Airport. However the Great Depression interrupted construction. The terminal and runways were finished as WPA projects in the 1930s. In the 1940s the Municipal Airport site also hosted the Wichita Army Airfield and Boeing Airplane Company Plant No. 1. In the 1950s the military took full control of the site and named it McConnell Air Force Base. In 1954, civilian airline service moved to the new Wichita Mid-Continent Airport (now known as the Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport) on the west side of town. Other airports in Wichita include the Colonel James Jabara Airport and Beech Field. From 1927 to 1929, Travel Air, with Walter Beech at the helm, grew to over 600 employees and operated from a huge factory complex constructed a few miles outside the city. Due to so many employees working at such a large complex, it was dubbed \\"Travel Air City\\" by Wichita residents. The company merged with the huge Curtiss-Wright Corporation in the Roaring Twenties' heyday of company buyouts and takeovers just two months before the Stock Market crash in 1929. Workers were laid off by the hundreds during 1930 and 1931 and by the fall of 1932, the remaining Travel Air employees were let go, the equipment was sold, and the entire Travel Air plant sat empty. By 1928, Wichita's varied aircraft industry was producing the highest volume of aircraft of any city in the United States (927 airplanes that year) and established Wichita as the nation's \\"Air Capital\\"‚Äîa title officially accorded to Wichita in 1929 (for 1928 production), by the American airplane manufacturers' national trade association, then known as the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce.Aeronautical Yearbook, 1929, Aeronautical Chamber of CommerceHarris, Richard, \\"About Monocoupe Production Numbers,\\" sidebar to \\"Monocoupe: Speed for the Common Man,\\" in AAHS Journal, Vol. 56, No. 4 - Winter 2011, American Aviation Historical Society, Huntington Beach, Calif. : (Continuing to produce aircraft in exceptional quantities, until the present, Wichita has never relinquished the title, and eventually began claiming the title \\"Air Capital of the World\\" -- outproducing all other cities in the world in total aircraft production by the late 1960s.)Verhovek, Sam Howe, \\"Where Planes Are Built, a Setback,\\" October 24, 2001, New York Times retrieved August 8, 2017Dan Glickman, as told to Joan Raymond, /business/06flier.html \\"The In-Flight Movie Is Always Better When It‚Äôs Your Son's,\\" May 6, 2008, New York Times In the late 1920s, Wichita University, under engineering professor Alexander N. Petroff, became only the third college in the nation to offer a degree in aeronautical engineering. By the end of the 1930s, the college had extensive facilities, including a wind tunnel. : (The school, now Wichita State University, eventually expanded to offer Masters and Doctoral degrees in aeronautical engineering, and other related engineering disciplines, and its facilities expanded to include numerous engineering facilities, including multiple wind tunnels, and in recent decades a research alliance with the neighboring National Institute for Aviation Research (NIAR).) In March 1932, Beech quit the Curtiss-Wright Corporation to form Beech Aircraft, along with his wife Olive Ann, and hired Ted Wells as his chief engineer. The first few \\"Beechcraft\\" were built in the vacant Cessna Aircraft plant, which had also closed during the depression; Beech later leased and then bought the Travel Air plant from Curtiss-Wright and moved his factory to this plant. Beech's first aircraft, the Model 17 (later dubbed the \\"Staggerwing\\"), was first flown on November 5, 1932. Nearly 100 Staggerwings are still in existence, many in flying condition. However, the aircraft that would propel the small company into a huge corporation was the Model 18 \\"Twin Beech\\", of which thousands were built from 1937 to 1969-- the longest continuously produced aircraft in the world when production ended. Staggerwing production ended in 1946, replaced by general aviation's first successful, fully modern light aircraft, the V-tailed, four-seat, single- engine Beechcraft Bonanza. Approximately 750 were built and sold in the first year, despite a recession and a devastating aviation industry shakeout. In various forms, the Bonanza has now become the world's longest continuously produced aircraft, still in production in a straight-tailed, six-seat version. Other models evolved from the Bonanza, ultimately culminating in the twin- turboprop Beechcraft King Air and Beechcraft Super King Air, the world's most popular turbine-powered business aircraft. The Beech line added imported business jets from Britain and Japan, a military trainer from Switzerland, and also produced military drones. On February 8, 1980, Beech Aircraft Corporation was purchased by the Raytheon Corporation and later sold to Onex Corp., which renamed it Hawker Beechcraft. Major problems followed both takeovers, including troubled developments of the advanced business turboprop Beechcraft Starship and jets, and by late 2012 / early 2013 the company entered bankruptcy proceedings--emerging without its troubled business-jet line, as Beechcraft Corp., focused solely on its popular line of propeller-driven aircraft and military drones.McCoy, Daniel (interview with Beechcraft CEO Bill Boisture), \\"Back to Beechcraft,\\" Wichita Business Journal, Feb. 22, 2013Harris, Richard, \\"The Hawker-Beechcraft Story: A Quick History of HBC\\" from the Aviation Answer-Man website, 2013 In 2014, Cessna parent company Textron acquired Beechcraft and combined both Cessna and Beechcraft (including the Hawker brand) into a new division known as Textron Aviation. After the 1929 stock market crash, Stearman and Boeing were acquired by United Aircraft and Transport Corporation (UATC). In 1934, antitrust action broke up UATC, and Boeing was spun off to house all UATC manufacturing subsidiaries west of the Mississippi river, including Wichita's Stearman. That same year, the Wichita plant began production of the successful Boeing-Stearman Model 75 \\"Kaydet\\" Navy and Army - Air Corps primary biplane trainer. After the crash of the Boeing XB-17 prototype in 1935, Wichita banker Arthur Kinkaid (IV National Bank of Wichita) supported Boeing and ensured that the Boeing-Stearman plant would remain in Wichita. By mid-2014, Boeing had wound down its Wichita operations and put its remaining facilities in the city up for sale. B-47A pilots training at Wichita's McConnell AFB in 1955. The bombers were built across the runway at Boeing. The city experienced a population explosion during World War II when it became a major manufacturing center for the Boeing B-29 bombers needed in the war effort.Herman, Arthur. Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II, pp. 297-300, 307-8, 314-318, 321, Random House, New York, NY, 2012. . By 1945, an average of 4.2 bombers were being produced daily in Wichita. For several decades, Boeing was Wichita's (and Kansas') largest private-sector employer, and Boeing-Wichita was Boeing's largest factory complex outside Washington State, and one of the nation's largest factories of any kind. Wichita saw some of its fastest population growth of the 20th century during the peak of the Cold War when Wichita was the headquarters for the Boeing Military Airplane Company and home to the McConnell Air Force Base. BoMAC produced all Boeing B-47 Stratojet aircraft and 63% of the Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses in Wichita. At various times McConnell Air Force Base hosted the 3520th Combat Crew Training Wing (ATC) and 4347th Combat Crew Training Wing (SAC) B-47 training units, the 381st Strategic Missile Wing that controlled various LGM-25C Titan II missile silos around Wichita, the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing, 23d Tactical Fighter Wing, 91st Air Refueling Squadron, 384th Air Refueling Wing/Bombardment Wing, and the Kansas Air National Guard 184th Tactical Fighter Training Group. Wichita's mid-continental location made it ideal for basing strategic assets, allowing maximum time to react to a Soviet missile attack launched over the north pole or from oceangoing submarines. B-52D assembly Wichita BW-93529 (7251378576) Several aircraft from McConnell AFB crashed in the city, including: * On March 28, 1956 a Boeing B-47 Stratojet, 51-2175, of the 3520th FTW suffered an explosion in a bomb bay fuel tank and shed its wings over East Wichita crashing four miles (6 km) NE of the city, killing three crew. * On January 16, 1965 a fuel-laden Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker (57-1442, c/n 17513) crashed after an engine failure shortly after takeoff from McConnell. It incinerated an area near the intersection of 20th and Piatt in north-central Wichita, killing 23 on the ground plus the 7 crew members; the largest non- natural disaster in Kansas history. The site of the crash was turned into Piatt Memorial Park. A monument was erected at the park in 2007.Cotter, Cornelius P., Jet Tanker Crash, 1968, Univ. of Kansas Press, Lawrence, KS.Roney, Tiffany, \\"Piatt St. crash remembered\\" Wichita Eagle newspaper, Jan. 15, 2011.Leiker, Amy Renee, \\"New book to chronicle 1965 tanker crash near 21st and Piatt ,\\" Wichita Eagle newspaper, Jan. 12, 2013.Carter, David W., Mayday Over Wichita, book (Facebook promotional web page) as downloaded May 18, 2013. * On March 5, 1974 a Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker (57-1500, of the 91st Air Refueling Squadron, 384th Air Refueling Wing) carrying 136,000 pounds of fuel crashed 3,000 feet from the main runway, after it apparently lost power. Two of the seven crew were killed. In 1962, the Lear Jet Corporation was established when the Swiss American Aviation Corporation brought the tooling for building a failed ground-attack fighter to Wichita, with the objective of converting it to a business jet, and opened a plant at Wichita's airport. On February 7, 1963, assembly of the first Learjet aircraft began and the following year, the company was renamed the Lear Jet Corporation. The Lear Jet (later \\"Learjet\\") was an instant success, the nation's first \\"popular\\" business jet, selling over 100 units within two years, quickly becoming the global generic image of the business jet, and the popular icon of the glamorous, upper-class \\"jet-set\\" lifestyle‚Äîwhile establishing Wichita as a successful jet-aircraft design center. The company was acquired by a series of investors, particularly Gates Rubber Company which acquired the company in 1967, and renamed the enterprise Gates Learjet. Following three years of suspended aircraft production, the company was acquired in 1987 by a venture firm, Integrated Resources, which renamed the manufacturer Learjet Corporation, and resumed production. In 1990, the Canadian aircraft manufacturing firm Bombardier Aerospace purchased Learjet. By the end of 1999, Wichita had produced over 2,000 Learjets, and the factory was still producing aircraft as of mid-2017.Paur, Jason, Autopia: \\"The Lear Jet Turns 50 ‚Äî But It Almost Didn‚Äôt Make It Off the Ground,\\" October 07, 2013, Wired, retrieved August 8, 2017Huber, Mark, \\"Learjet Turns 50,\\" October 07, 2013, Aviation International News, retrieved August 8, 2017Glancey, Jonathan, Culture: \\"The Learjet: The private plane that changed travel,\\" August 13, 2015, BBC, retrieved August 8, 2017\\"50 Years of Learjets,\\" October 9, 2013, Flying magazine, retrieved August 8, 2017Guillemette, Roger, \\"Learjet 23/24,\\" in Centennial of Flight website, U.

Though small and slow, it was much safer, easier to fly, and less expensive to purchase and operate than the Learjet, and quickly gained prominence. Stretched versions followed, and eventually produced larger, faster business jets matching or exceeding Learjet performance and capacity. Today, Cessna business jets are the world's most popular, with over 3,000 flying. * Beechcraft, too, sold business jets, but not successfully at first. Eventually, Beech acquired the Mitsubishi Diamond I design from Japan, and later acquired the Hawker Business Jets division of British Aerospace (producing the Hawker 700) -- modifying and selling those products successfully under \\"Beech\\" and \\"Hawker\\" brands. In the 1970s, airplane designer/entrepreneur Jim Bede ‚Äî an aeronautical engineering graduate of Wichita State University who had just developed the Bede BD-1 into the American Yankee in Cleveland, Ohio, leading to the popular Grumman-American light aircraft line ‚Äî returned to the Wichita area to develop and market his Bede BD-5 micro-kitplane in nearby Newton, Kansas. Bede's chief aeronautical engineer was Burt Rutan‚Äîwho, in the 1980s (with his brother, test pilot Dick Rutan) helped Wichita's Beechcraft develop the world's first government- certified all-carbon-fiber composite airplane, the Beech Starship. In the late 1980s two Boeing 747s were modified at Boeing-Wichita to become VC-25s to serve as Air Force One. at Boeing's military aircraft conversion center. In August 1997, Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas. The company relocated the headquarters of the BMAC division to McDonnell Douglas' St. Louis facility. In the 1990s, Boeing responded to conflict with labor unions by eventually selling off most of its commercial-aircraft subassembly factory, and its operations, to a newly created subcontractor, Spirit AeroSystems (initially largely owned by Boeing, itself), which continued the extensive Boeing jetliner manufacturing operations there‚Äîbut without the financial burden of the original Boeing labor-union contracts. The facility continues as the supplier of major parts for all Boeing jetliners, including the front end of all Boeing jetliners, and 75% of Boeing's most popular plane, the Boeing 737, including the entire fuselage of that plane, which is shipped by rail to Seattle for final assembly. Other subassemblies for other Boeing aircraft (particularly engine nacelles), are built by Spirit at the Wichita factory. In the early 21st Century, Wichita aircraft manufacturing saw a return to its roots with the development of a small aircraft-manufacturing enterprise, Belite Aircraft Corp., at a local private airstrip (the Wichita Glider Port, northeast of town). Belite's initial product was the relabeled single-seat version of the popular SkyStar Kitfox, a metal-framed and fabric-skinned light sport aircraft. However, at the start of the century, Boeing-Wichita remained the city's (and the state's) largest single private-sector employer, with about 12,000 workers. The factory built Boeing jetliner subassemblies (including whole fuselages of Boeing's most popular plane, the 737, and nose sections of all other Boeing planes). Labor unrest, however, created friction.McMillin, Molly, \\"Boeing set to end 85-year history with Wichita,\\" January 04, 2012, Wichita Eagle retrieved August 8, 2017 A declining economy, followed by the 9/11 terrorist-hijacked airliner attacks, and subsequent war, drove the aviation industry into a depression, and Wichita was among the cities hardest hit. Of the 48,000 Wichita aircraft workers employed in 2000, nearly a quarter‚Äî11,000‚Äîwere laid off within the following two years, with several thousand more scheduled for layoff or furlough.Kilborn, Peter T., \\"Slump in Plane Travel Grounds Wichita, World's 'Air Capital',\\" January 18, 2012, New York Times retrieved August 8, 2017 In 2004, following a contentious workers' strike, and claiming economic necessity, Boeing announced it would sell off its commercial aircraft manufacturing operations in Wichita‚Äîthe bulk of its operations there. In 2005, the factory continued to operate, same as before, but under \\"Spirit AeroSystems\\"‚Äîan entity Boeing created with Toronto- based Onex Corporation‚Äîtechnically a separate entity from Boeing, allowing Boeing to discard its Wichita union contracts and obligations, and force factory workers' wages back down. Eventually, Boeing sold its stake in Spirit, but Spirit retains its role as Boeing's largest subcontractor‚Äîwhile also branching out to support other manufacturers (particularly Boeing's chief rival, Airbus) at factories elsewhere, particularly in Oklahoma. In 2006, Spirit became a publicly-traded company, and in 2014 Onex announced it was selling off its remaining stock.McMillin, Molly, \\"Onex director Tawfiq Popatia joins Spirit AeroSystems' board,\\" November 16, 2010, Wichita Eagle retrieved August 8, 2017McMillin, Molly, \\"Onex offers rest of Spirit stock up for sale,\\" August 7, 2014, Wichita Eagle retrieved August 8, 2017 Boeing retained ownership of much of the original Boeing-Wichita complex, however, and continued to operate its dwindling Military Division facilities there, with around 2,000 workers, chiefly performing aircraft modifications. Angling for an Air Force contract to replace its own, aging KC-135 aerial tankers, Boeing promised Wichita thousands of related jobs, if Wichita leaders would pressure Congress and the federal government to give Boeing the contract. Though Wichita leaders complied, and Boeing won the contract, Boeing then promptly announced it would close its remaining Boeing-Wichita facilities, and leave the city permanently by late 2013‚Äîending an 85-year presence in the city‚Äîa stunning shock to the city. However, Wichita remains a major manufacturing center for the aircraft industry today, with Textron (Cessna, Beechcraft and Textron Aviation) and Bombardier (Learjet) having major manufacturing centers in town, as well as design and engineering facilities run by Airbus, the international Bombardier Flight Test Center, numerous aerospace subcontractors and parts manufacturers, and several aerospace technology training centers, schools and research facilities. Entrepreneurial hub The original Pizza Hut building, which was moved to the campus of Wichita State University Wichita was also a significant entrepreneurial business center during the pre- and post-war period, with the Garvey Organization, Koch Industries, Coleman, Mentholatum, White Castle, Pizza Hut, Taco Tico, Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers, and having all been founded in Wichita. (Ironically, White Castle closed all of their restaurants in Wichita in 1938 and has not operated in the state of Kansas after a failed revival attempt in the Kansas City area in the early 1990s.) The entrepreneurial spirit of Wichita led to the creation of one of the first academic centers to study and support entrepreneurship at the Wichita State University Center for Entrepreneurship. Davis Manufacturing invented and mass-produced a popular trenching machine in the 1960s‚Äîthe Ditch Witch‚Äîand was later acquired by J. I. Case, who gradually turned the factory towards producing the company's skid-steer loaders‚Äîwhich it does today for Case's parent company, Case New Holland(CNH), under both \\"Case\\" and \\"New Holland\\" names. Another large Wichita industrial facility, Chance Manufacturing became a national leader in amusement park rides, including ferris wheels, and remains active today. Chance has also manufactured trolley- styled busses and miniature trains. In addition to Chance's vehicles, Wichita has been home to Big Dog Motorcycles. In October 1932, orchestra leader Gage Brewer introduced the electric guitar to the world from Wichita using an instrument developed by what would later become known as the Rickenbacker Guitar Company. Recent history has seen increased development in downtown and to the east and west sides of Wichita. In June 2005,Heck, J. \\"Wichita Business Journal\\", July 1, 2011. Sedgwick County voters approved a sales tax raise to build a new arena downtown to replace the aging Kansas Coliseum, located north of the city. This is considered by some as a stepping stone to launch new development downtown. Politics The Dockum Drug Store sit-in was one of the first organized lunch-counter sit-ins for the purpose of integrating segregated establishments in the United States. The protest began in July 1958 in Wichita at the Dockum Drug Store, a store in the old Rexall chain, in which protesters would sit at the counter all day until the store closed, ignoring taunts from counterprotesters. The sit-in ended three weeks later when the owner relented and agreed to serve black patrons, taking place 18 months before the more widely publicized Greensboro sit-ins in January 1960.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Ronald Walters, Rights Leader and Scholar, Dies at 72\\", The New York Times, September 14, 2010.

Until his identity was finally discovered by police, he was known as the \\"BTK killer\\". Rader was particularly known for sending taunting letters to police and the media. In 2005 a letter that Rader sent on a floppy disc included meta-data that led police to identify and arrest him. In August 1976, Michael Soles, an unemployed welder from Sand Springs, Oklahoma, set up a sniper position on the roof of the Holiday Inn Plaza, then the tallest building in downtown Wichita. Over the course of an eleven-minute shooting spree, he killed three people and wounded six. The gunman was wounded by police and taken into custody.

Ellery W. Stone, Pacific Radio News, June 1921, page 368. Radio station 6XC was established by radio inventor Lee de Forest following his March 1920 move from New York City to San Francisco. In late 1919, de Forest had restarted an experimental radio station, 2XG (also known as \\"The Highbridge station\\"), at his laboratory in New York City, in order to promote the DeForest Radio Telephone and Telegraph company and showcase developments in vacuum-tube technology. Beginning in November 1919, that station had featured a nightly broadcast of news and entertainment. However, in early 1920 de Forest moved 2XG's transmitter from the Bronx to Manhattan without first getting permission from the government, and due to this infraction the local District Radio Inspector ordered him to suspend the station's operations.Father of Radio: The Autobiography of Lee de Forest, 1950, pages 349-351. De Forest's response was to ship 2XG's 500-watt transmitter from New York to San Francisco, where it was used to start a new station, also operating under an Experimental license, now with the call sign 6XC. Ellery W. Stone made arrangements for the station to be located at the California Theater,Ellery W. Stone: An Interview Conducted by Frank A. Polkinghorn, April 24, 1974, IEEE History Center (ethw.org) thus 6XC was commonly referred to as \\"The California Theater Station\\". It began operating in April, and was initially licensed to Lee de Forest, Inc.\\"New Stations: Special Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, October 1, 1920, page 5: The \\"6\\" in 6XC's call sign indicated that the station was located in the 6th Radio Inspection District, while the \\"X\\" signified it held an Experimental license. The new station's broadcasts would be even more varied than what had been offered in New York, and de Forest personally oversaw the station's construction. The transmitter was located in the flies of the theater, with an antenna strung from the theater roof to the adjoining Humboldt Bank Building. Acoustics were a challenge, because the orchestra needed to be heard by both the auditorium audience and radio listeners. Because of this restriction, the normal radio studio practice of deadening echoes by the use of wall coverings was unavailable. The solution for radio pickup was to suspend a large horn 40 feet (12 meters) above the orchestra, with the horn located above the quieter string instruments and away from the louder drums and basses.\\"Broadcasting Service of 1920 Compared With Concerts Now\\", San Francisco Chronicle, June 18, 1922, page F7.

The station also featured professional singers, including Mary White and Frieda Hempel,\\"Hempel Heard in Honolulu\\", Musical Monitor, June 1921, page 441. plus lectures by prominent speakers including Ellery Stone\\"The First Lecture by Radiophone\\", Pacific Radio News, August 1920, pages 4, 8. and American Radio Relay League president Hiram Percy Maxim.\\"Talking to a Nation by Wireless\\", Journal of Electricity, September 1, 1920, page 219. Another special program had Robert Newton Lynch, Vice President and General Manager of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, sending greetings to the Japanese Armament Conference delegation as it approached the city aboard the Korea Maru.\\"Japan's Envoys to Limitation of Armament Conference Welcomed\\", San Francisco Business, October 21, 1921, page 6. An estimated 1,500 concerts were broadcast by the end of 1921. In mid-1921 control of 6XC was transferred to the Atlantic-Pacific Radio Supplies Company,\\"Alterations and Corrections: Special Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, September 1, 1921, page 7. which was the local DeForest company representative. In September, the station's primary schedule consisted of daily (except Sunday) concerts from 4:00-4:30 p.m., 7:15-7:45 p.m. and 9:00-9:45 p.m., plus Sunday at 10:00-12:00 noon, in addition to daily (except Sunday) \\"press\\" from 7:45-8:00 p.m.\\"New Radio Telephone Schedules\\" Pacific Radio News, September 1921, page 49.

Although initially there were no formal standards for U.S. radio stations that provided entertainment broadcasts, effective December 1, 1921 the Department of Commerce adopted a regulation requiring that stations engaged in broadcasting to the public now needed to hold a Limited Commercial license.\\"Amendments to Regulations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 10. The first California station to meet this standard was Arno A. Kluge's KQL, first licensed on October 13, 1921. Therefore a new license, with the randomly assigned call sign of KZY, was issued for the station on December 8, 1921. At the same time, it was decided to transfer the station to the home of Henry M. Shaw, the Atlantic-Pacific Radio Supplies president, located in the Rock Ridge section of Oakland, California, and operate KZY from there.\\"KZY‚ÄìA Record Installation\\" by Ellery W. Stone, Radio, February 1922, pages 11-12. After a rush to move the facility to the new site, KZY's official opening took place on Christmas morning, December 25, 1921, with a live concert of Christmas-themed music. 6XC had operated on its own longwave frequency, but the new regulations required that all broadcasting stations use a shared entertainment wavelength of 360 meters (833 kilohertz). Under the initial timesharing agreement, KZY's schedule was 3:30-4:30 p.m. and 7:00‚Äì7:30 p.m. daily (except Sundays), plus 3:00‚Äì4:00 p.m. on Sundays, 2:30‚Äì3:15 p.m. on Wednesdays, and 8:15‚Äì9:00 p.m. on Saturdays. Due to its more remote location, the station attracted fewer prominent artists than it had in San Francisco, although it did feature the radio debut of Glenhall Taylor, who on May 11, 1922 shared the microphone with Stanford University's first president, David Starr Jordan.Before Television: The Radio Years by Glenhall Taylor, 1979, page 15. The station also was known for picking up the signals of other distant radio stations, including WGY,\\"Concert by Radio Is Sent From New York Here\\", Riverside Daily Press, March 25, 1922, page 1. the General Electric station in Schenectady, New York. Although KZY was well-managed, the station would be short-lived, and gave its last known broadcast the evening of June 17, 1922.\\"Rockridge Station Gives Last Concert\\", Oakland Tribune, June 17, 1922, page 20. At the time it was stated that this was only a temporary suspension, necessitated because Henry M. Shaw had resigned as Atlantic- Pacific's president and the station needed to be moved from his home. There were plans to move KZY back to San Francisco\\"Rockridge Radio Station to be Moved to S.F.\\", Oakland Tribune, June 17, 1922, page 20. with the new location said to be the Atlantic-Pacific headquarters at 646 Mission Street.\\"Alterations and Corrections: Broadcasting Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, July 1, 1922, page 9.

He joined the French Royal Army in 1776 and became a non-commissioned officer by 1791 when he reentered civilian life. The following year he joined a volunteer battalion and fought at Jemappes. He was badly wounded at Famars in May 1793 and was appointed general of brigade in the Army of the North in September that year. After being wounded again he was promoted general of division in March 1794. After commanding a division at Grandreng and Erquelinnes in May 1794, he was transferred to another division which he led in operations around Ypres in June. During the winter of 1794 he participated in the invasion of the Dutch Republic. After garrison duty in Holland he commanded interior posts in France during the Napoleonic Wars. The exception came in 1809 when he led a reserve infantry division. He lived long enough to be awarded the Grand Cross of the L√©gion d'Honneur in 1856 in the reign of Napoleon III before dying a few months later at the age of 95. Early career Despeaux was born on 14 October 1761 at Malassine. This hamlet was located near Beauvais in the Oise department. His father Laurent Despeaux was a woodcutter who married Marguerite Petit, his second wife, on 25 November 1759. Despeaux enlisted in the Flandre Infantry Regiment on 2 November 1776 at the age of 15. He was promoted corporal on 15 June 1780 and sergeant on 20 May 1784. He was at the Palace of Versailles when the mob came for King Louis XVI of France. French Revolution Despeaux took a leave of absence from his regiment in August 1791 before emerging as adjutant-major in the 9th Battalion of the Nord National Guard on 25 October 1792. Another source stated that he was not appointed adjutant-major until after the Battle of Jemappes, a French victory on 6 November 1792. A 1793 order of battle for the Army of the North listed the 9th Nord Battalion, but the month and day were not given. The French were defeated by the Coalition in the Battle of Famars on 23 May 1793. After greatly distinguishing himself and suffering a serious wound, he received a battlefield promotion to chef de bataillon (major). However, a second source stated that he became commanding officer of the 9th Nord on 28 April 1793. He was promoted to general of brigade on 3 September of the same year. He was sent on a mission along the Sambre River in the course of which he was wounded again. Soon after, he was elevated to the rank of general of division on 19 March 1794. Jacques Desjardin At the beginning of May 1794, Despeaux's 7,042-man division was at Limont-Fontaine guarding the Sambre between Berlaimont and Maubeuge. The French plan was to form the right wing of the Army of the North under Jacques Desjardin and the Army of the Ardennes under Louis Charbonnier into a 60,000-strong army and send it toward Mons. Unfortunately, the overall commander Jean-Charles Pichegru neglected to appoint a single commander of the army and the generals were hampered by two of the most arrogant representatives on mission in Louis Antoine de Saint-Just and Philippe-Fran√ßois-Joseph Le Bas. The results were not happy and the army suffered three defeats between 11 May and 3 June. Despeaux's division was joined to the divisions of Desjardin (14,075 men), Jacques Fromentin (15,719 men) and Fran√ßois Muller (6,815 men) of the Army of the North and Philippe Joseph Jacob's 19,000-man division of the Army of the Ardennes. In Despeaux's division the regular troops consisted of the 1st Battalions of the 17th and 25th Line Infantry Demi-brigades, 127 horsemen of the 6th Cavalry and 83 gunners from the 3rd and 6th Artillery. His volunteer battalions were the 1st Loiret, 1st Hainaut Chasseurs, 3rd Meurthe, 4th and 9th Nord and 6th Pas-de- Calais. All infantry battalions numbered between 783 and 919 soldiers. Muller assumed command of Desjardin's division while his own division remained as the Maubeuge garrison. On the morning of 10 May 1794 the French army launched its offensive in seven columns with Despeaux's division on the far left marching towards Hantes. After serious fighting near Merbes-le-Ch√¢teau on the 12th, the Coalition forces abandoned the entrenched camp at Hantes and Despeaux's troops camped near Solre-le-Sambre. On 13 May 1794, Franz Wenzel, Graf von Kaunitz- Rietberg and his Coalition army defeated the French in the Battle of Grandreng. Despeaux was in a second line behind Muller's division which attacked Grand-Reng while Fromentin advanced on Croix-lez-Rouveroy to their right. Though the French cannons bogged down in the mud, the infantry of Muller and Despeaux were able to seize a few outlying redoubts while subjected to intense artillery fire and slashing cavalry attacks. The battle raged until the early evening when Kaunitz assembled a mounted force under Michael von Kienmayer and hurled it at the French. This cavalry charge decided the battle and caused the French withdraw south of the Sambre. Charbonnier's Army of the Ardennes failed to intervene while Desjardin's 35,000 troops futilely rushed at Kaunitz's 22,000 men behind entrenchments. One French general later wrote, \\"We were children in the art of war\\". The French recrossed the Sambre on 20 May 1794, with Despeaux's division again taking position in a second line behind Fromentin and Muller, facing west. This time Jean Adam Mayer's division of the Army of the Ardennes was posted on the right flank near Binche. Kaunitz launched an attack at 8:00 am on 21 May and quickly overran Erquelinnes. Desjardin and Jean Baptiste Kl√©ber organized a counterattack which retook the village. Fighting continued until 3:00 pm when Despeaux's division somewhat belatedly advanced with his battalions arrayed in checkerboard formation. At this the Coalition forces withdrew. On 22 May Despeaux was replaced in command of his division by Anne Charles Basset Montaigu. On the 24th Kaunitz beat the French again in the Battle of Erquelinnes, inflicting heavy casualties and capturing 32 artillery pieces. Jean-Charles Pichegru Despeaux assumed command of a division from the left wing of the Army of the North. Assailed on both left and right wings, the Coalition armies allowed the French to seize the initiative. On 1 June 1794, Jean Victor Marie Moreau's division began the Siege of Ypres. The besieging troops were covered by Joseph Souham's division which was supported by the divisions of Pierre Antoine Michaud on the left and Despeaux on the right. The three covering divisions fought an action at Roeselare on 10 June, driving back a Coalition corps led by Fran√ßois S√©bastien Charles Joseph de Croix, Count of Clerfayt. On 13 June Clerfayt launched a surprise attack on Despeaux's division, routing Philippe Joseph Malbrancq's brigade and pushing Jean-Baptiste Salme's brigade back toward Menen (Menin). However, Jacques MacDonald's brigade of Souham's division held off repeated attacks at Hooglede. After six hours, Jan Willem de Winter's brigade came up on MacDonald's left while Salme's rallied brigade moved forward on MacDonald's right. At this, Clerfayt's worn out soldiers withdrew. Ypres surrendered to the French on 18 June. On 26 June 1794, the French right wing under Jean- Baptiste Jourdan beat the Coalition army at the Battle of Fleurus. By 1 July, Pichegru's army occupied Bruges and on the 10th took Brussels. The next day, the armies of Pichegru and Jordan linked hands. The two armies soon diverged, with Pichegru following the British and Dutch northward while Jourdan turned eastward in pursuit of the Austrians. Pichegru's army occupied Antwerp on 27 July. An order of battle for the Army of the North on 1 September showed Despeaux leading the 4th Division with Salme as the only brigadier. The units included three battalions each of the 38th and 131st Line Infantry Demi- brigades, 3rd Battalion of Tirailleurs, 5th Battalion of Chasseurs, four squadrons of the 19th Cavalry and two squadrons of the 13th Chasseurs √† Cheval. On this date the 4th Division numbered 5,432 infantry and 647 cavalry with 283 gunners serving 16 cannons and two howitzers. The fortress of Grave fell to the division on 29 December, but by that time Salme seems to have been in command. Despeaux was first appointed to command Tournai, then Antwerp. Later he was in charge of Western Brabant where he oversaw the suppression of the religious houses. On 13 June 1795 he was not listed in the organization of chiefs of staff. He was several times put in retirement and then brought back into active service. In 1797 he was governor of Flanders. In 1798 the French Directory named him to command the 18th Military Division at Dijon. Empire On 24 April 1805 Despeaux was made a member of the L√©gion d'Honneur. During the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809, a Reserve Corps was assembled under Marshal Fran√ßois Christophe de Kellermann with its headquarters at Frankfurt. There were four divisions, the 1st under Olivier Macoux Rivaud de la Raffini√®re, 2nd under Despeaux, 3rd under Joseph Lagrange and Reserve under Marc Antoine de Beaumont. Despeaux commanded six provisional infantry battalions divided into two brigades, a total of 2,520 soldiers. He was appointed to division command on 8 May 1809. He was assigned to Jean-Andoche Junot's corps but when that general departed, Despeaux assumed command for a time. He spent several days in the fortress during the Siege of Flushing in the Walcheren Campaign. On 20 September 1809 he was assigned to command the 20th Military Division at P√©rigueux. During the remaining years of the First French Empire he served in various interior posts. He was named Officer of the L√©gion d'Honneur on 21 January 1814. Later career After the First Restoration Despeaux was placed in command of Metz and made a Chevalier of the Order of Saint-Louis. On 25 March 1815 he was appointed governor of Le Quesnoy. After the Second Restoration he was put on the inactive list. After a brief stint of active service for two tours of inspection, he was retired from military service. The king made Despeaux a baron on 11 June 1819 and named him a Commander of the L√©gion d'Honneur on 1 March 1821. He was also awarded the Swedish Order of the Sword. Despeaux was named Grand Officer of the L√©gion d'Honneur on 22 August 1853 and awarded the Grand Cross of the L√©gion d'Honneur on 7 February 1856. He died on 23 October 1856. He is buried in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in the 15th Division along Chemin de Gramont.

This is one of many sections of the sports club Championnet Sports whose socio-educational and cultural activities as well as the very important real estate is managed by a third association, the Association Championnet. The club is best known for its good performance in the championship of France basketball from 1940, counting among its members several prominent players.  History  In 1891 Championnet founded in the parish \\"St. Genevieve Great Careers.\\" Various activities are pushing to declare in 1907 a multi-sports association affiliated to the Sports Championnet FGSPF. It was not until 1914 to identify the first game of basketball. Then the section is gradually developing into Champion of France in 1945 and provide three players to the team of France in 1948 during the London Olympic Games. The club then participates in first five France championship seasons of basketball (1950‚Äì1954) and descends the 1954‚Äì55 season in Division Excellence. It goes back to a season in National Division in 1955‚Äì56 and reappears there one last time in 1961‚Äì62.

She participated at the 2015 IIHF Women's World Championship. In the autumn of 2015, Lacquette joined the Calgary Inferno of the CWHL. In 2018, Lacquette became the first First Nations woman to play for the Canadian women's Olympic hockey team. To honour her accomplishment, Lacquette's Olympic hockey stick was included in the diversity exhibit in the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2018. Early life Lacquette grew up in the remote M√©tis community of Mallard, Manitoba. Her father is from the O-Chi-Chak Ko Sipi First Nation of Manitoba, while her mother is from the Cote First Nation in Saskatchewan. Lacquette has a sister named Tara and a brother named Taren, both of whom play hockey. Lacquette began skating at the age of four, and was soon introduced to hockey by her father and cousins. Since there were no hockey rinks in Mallard, Lacquette's father built one in their family yard. By the time she was five, Lacquette knew she wanted to play in organized hockey, and her father began taking her to the nearest indoor rink, located in the community of Winnipegosis. As she grew up, Lacquette began facing racism at hockey games. At the age of twelve, she played a tournament in Winnipeg where she encountered taunts such as \\"dirty Indian\\" and \\"go back to the reserve\\". Hateful comments have come from opponents, tournament fans, parents of hockey players, and even a few of her own teammates. Despite being tempted to quit at times, Lacquette was supported by her father and decided to continue playing hockey. Lacquette's father has expressed pride at his daughter's perseverance: \\"She basically kicked that door over and knocked it down and it's not a barrier anymore in her life, and that's something that's important for not only her but anybody who's faced a barrier in their life.\\" Playing career University and NCAA teams Lacquette has played for the University of Manitoba Bisons and at the NCAA level at the University of Minnesota-Duluth. Shannon Miller, a former head hockey coach at the University of Minnesota Duluth, has described Lacquette as \\"the most naturally talented player to ever come through our program\\". CWHL Appearing with the Calgary Inferno in the 2016 Clarkson Cup finals, Lacquette earned an assist as the Inferno emerged victorious in a convincing 8‚Äì3 final. In 2019, Lacquette led all CWHL players in an online vote, gaining the opportunity to serve as a captain at the 4th Canadian Women's Hockey League All-Star Game. Olympics In 2014, Lacquette was in the running for the Canadian Olympic hockey team, but was a late cut. In 2018, Lacquette became the first First Nations woman to join the Canadian women's Olympic hockey team, set to play defence at the 2018 Winter Olympics. Lacquette's first appearance with the Canadian Women's National Team was in 2013 at the Four Nations Cup tournament held in Lake Placid, United States. In 2015, Lacquette played her first IIHF Women's World Championship with team Canada in Sweden, where Canada finished second to the United States. Accomplishments Brigette Lacquette was named Top Defenceman for her performance at the 2010 IIHF World Women's Under-18 Championships. Where she also helped lead Canada to its first gold medal at the Under-18 Championships after assisting the overtime winner. Volunteer work Lacquette is a partner athlete with the sports mentorship organization Classroom Champions. As a participant of the organization's \\"Circle\\" program, which connects athletes and youth of Indigenous heritage, Lacquette has provided mentorship to children from the Piitoayis (Eagle Lodge) Family School in Inglewood, Calgary. Inspiration Lacquettes role model growing up was, fellow aboriginal athlete, Jordin Tootoo. Lacquette embraces her title as a role model to young First Nations kids across Canada. \\"I'm super excited to be that role model for those kids. Growing up I really didn't have that female role model to look up to,\\" said Lacquette. \\"It's just very special for me to be that role model for young First Nation girls across Canada, Indigenous kids across Canada. I'm just super excited to be that person for them.\\" References External links  * Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Calgary Inferno players Category:Canadian expatriate ice hockey players in the United States Category:Canadian women's ice hockey defencemen Category:Clarkson Cup champions Category:First Nations sportspeople Category:Ice hockey people from Manitoba Category:Ice hockey players at the 2018 Winter Olympics Category:Medalists at the 2018 Winter Olympics Category:Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs women's ice hockey players Category:Olympic ice hockey players of Canada Category:Olympic medalists in ice hockey Category:Olympic silver medalists for Canada Category:Sportspeople from Dauphin, Manitoba ","title":"Brigette Lacquette"},{"id":"46252898","text":"Richard Grelling (11 June 1853 ‚àí 14 January 1929) was a German lawyer, writer and pacifist who wrote the international best selling book J'Accuse in World War I, publicly criticizing the actions of Germany for waging a war of aggression in Europe. Early life Richard Grelling was born in Berlin, at that time the capital of Prussia. He studied law but after finishing his studies worked as a writer and dramatist. In 1892 he was a founder-member of the German Peace Society (German: Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft), of which he was vice-chairman. From 1903 he lived near Florence, until Italy joined the belligerents in 1915, after which he moved to Switzerland. World War I In 1915 Grelling wrote the anti-war book entitled J'Accuse, condemning the actions of Germany in causing the war through its foreign policies. The book was banned in Germany but was translated into many languages and enjoyed huge sales. Printed excerpts in the form of propaganda leaflets from its text were dropped by aircraft of the British Expeditionary Force into the Imperial German Army's trenches in France before the Battle of the Somme in 1916 in an endeavour to undermine the fighting morale of the German troops situated there.'Das Koniglich Preussische Reserve Infanterie Regiment Nr.15', by Maj. von Forstner. (Pub. 1929), P.285. He followed this success of J'Accuse with Das Verbrechen (The Crime), in which he attacked his critics, including his son, the philosopher Kurt Grelling. Later life He later worked for several newspapers, among them the Frankfurter Zeitung. During the Weimar Republic most of his writings were boycotted. Grelling died in Berlin.

Built between 1842 and 1849 in eclectic style, it is a national sanctuary dedicated to Saint Joseph, who has been the patron saint of Belgium since 1679. History and Architecture Inspired by the church of Trinit√† dei Monti in Rome, the architect Tilman-Fran√ßois Suys decided to created a church resembling one of Rome's many basilicas with a flat apse choir. The first stone of the building was laid by Cardinal Engelbert Sterckx on 6 April 1842. The Apostolic Nuncio, Cardinal Giacomo Cattani, consecrated the church on 24 June 1874 and also made it the National Shrine of Saint Joseph. The church was occupied by the Redemptorists for many decades until it was looked after by the Syriac Orthodox from 1989 to 2001. It was then acquired by the Priory of Christ the King of the Society of St. Pius X, offering a much needed place of worship for their growing number of parishioners. The church has three naves measuring a total of long and wide. Its vault is high and is supported by two rows of Corinthian columns that separate the two aisles of the main church. The building received protected status through a royal decree issued on 13 May 1981.

Apart from graduating from both the Rotterdam Dance Academy and the Hungarian Dance Academy she participated in dance courses all around the world. Thanks to her knowledge and experience in many genres of dance from ballet through broadway and jazz all the way to contemporary dance she contributed to the success of award-winning feature films, theatrical productions like Chicago (musical), television shows such as Britain's Got Talent, America's Got Talent, Eurovision (Moscow, 2009 and D√ºsseldorf, 2011) and Fake Off in addition to advertisements and other creative projects worldwide. Since 2004 she has been working on developing a special technique where she combines dancing with videomapping projections to create an interactive choreography supplemented by visual elements. From 2009 using videomapping technique has been a kind of \\"trademark\\" in her work. She is currently the artistic director and choreographer of the dance team called Freelusion.  Early life  T√≠mea Papp was born in Kaposv√°r, Hungary. She was raised in a family with three children, she has an older and a younger brother. Both her brothers grew up to be entrepreneurs; her younger brother became the co-founder of Freelusion. Her dad was a drummer who gave up being a professional musician for his family. Nevertheless, he never gave up creating rhythm with any object he could find around himself. T√≠mea's mother was an amateur dancer and a huge dance enthusiast her whole life. T√≠mea was infected with rhythm, music, and dancing from a very early age thanks to her parents. This impact was so great that she moved to P√©cs in her teenage years so she could start her professional dancing training in the High School of Arts.  Field of Scientific Research, Mission  As mentioned earlier, T√≠mea Papp growing up has been surrounded by inspiration which drew her towards dancing. Learning Latin dances and ballet in her childhood, she was fascinated by street dances in the early 80's. Beside the dancing she spent 4 years studying kung fu. Her body awareness in space became very important to her. Rudolf von Laban movement theoretic's space harmony theory has been a great influence on her work. All her research in movement, space and body awareness and her education and experience as a dancer lead to creating her own project: \\"Spacerider\\", which can be interpreted as her own avatar in her high-tech interactive choreographies.

Their music is largely instrumental with only a few songs containing vocal performances. The band consists of Mario Camarena (guitar), Erick Hansel (guitar), Esiah Camarena (bass) and Nathan Camarena (drums). History Early career Since 2008, they have been releasing demos via internet. In 2010, the band began a brief hiatus, but reunited in 2011 to record two new songs, \\"O.G.\\" and \\"Breathe\\". They returned in 2013 with the release of their debut EP entitled Newborn Sun. In 2014, Chon released their second EP, entitled Woohoo! and embarked on two consecutive nationwide tours with Animals as Leaders. Debut and departure with Pelisek In December 2014, Chon signed with the record label Sumerian Records, and announced they would be releasing their debut full-length album the following year. On February 5, 2015, the band announced their debut full length titled Grow would be released in March 2015. On March 5, the band premiered their song Can't Wait from the album via Red Bull. They released the album on March 24. Eight days prior the band embarked on a 27 date tour supporting Circa Survive. On December 16, 2015, Chon announced their first full US headlining tour, titled the Super Chon Bros Tour, with accompanying bands Polyphia and Strawberry Girls. They sold out every single show on the tour. Chon was also an opening band during the Sonic Unrest Tour, featuring headliner Periphery, and bands Sikth and Toothgrinder. On November 8, 2015, Chon stated via their Twitter feed that they parted ways with Drew Pelisek due to 'artistic differences'. It was also confirmed by Drew on a personal account. Second album and onward They recorded their second album Homey with Anthony Crawford on bass. Since Pelisek's departure, Chon has had 3 touring bassists, including original bassist Esiah Camarena, who played bass during the Journey's Unplugged tour. Esiah has returned as a permanent member of the band following his attendance on the Robot With Human Hair Vs. Chonzilla tour with Dance Gavin Dance. On June 7, 2019, Chon released their third full-length self-titled album, under Sumerian Records. Equipment Chon endorses Ibanez guitars and Overdrive Straps guitar straps. Guitarist Mario Camarena currently plays his signature Ibanez guitar, the MAR10, which is based on an Ibanez AZ series prototype in pink with a white pickguard. Earlier, he used the pink prototype in addition to a white Ibanez AZ prototype that went on to become a regular AZ Prestige model, as well as an Ibanez RG652fx with a custom floral print (including a black version of Yoshi, which Mario uses as his main character in the video game Super Smash Bros.), and an Ibanez S5521Q. He could also often be seen playing a custom Ibanez RG created by Seth Hollander. In YouTube video description. Before Chon's \\"Homey\\" album, Mario used a Vox AC30 tube amplifier and a Fender Super Sonic but has now switched to a Matchless amplifier. Erick Hansel primarily plays his signature Ibanez guitar, the EH10, which is based on the Ibanez AZ series. Earlier, he used a dark blue Ibanez AZ prototype, an RG652FX with a custom paint dip, an RG321MH (on early albums and performances), and an Ibanez Talman Prestige. Recently, Erick has been seen with either a Vox AC30 or a Matchless amplifier. Chon's early work was known to largely shun the use of effects pedals, but the band has since started experimenting heavily with pedals during the writing process for Homey. Musical style and influences In the early days the band were influenced by metal bands such as Necrophagist and post-hardcore band The Fall of Troy, but the band have also listed pianists such as Hiromi Uehara, Tigran Hamasyan, and Alex Argento as influences in their sound. Chon's music is noted for its use of complex harmony with heavy emphasis on seventh chords, as well as the odd time signatures and polyrhythms typical of the progressive rock genre. Their second album, Homey, saw the band incorporating elements of trip-hop and electronic music, which can be heard in tracks such as 'Nayhoo.'

Early life Thomas was born in November 1832 at Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn, Cardiganshire, Wales to Thomas Thomas, carrier, and his wife Mary (n√©e Hughes).Thomas, Lewis (1832‚Äì1913) - Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 28 March 2015. At age nine he was working at a woolen factory and at fifteen was employed in the lead-mines of Esgair and Bwlch Gwyn. He moved on to working in the coal and iron mines of South Wales and in 1859 he set off to Australia. Landing in Victoria, he worked as a gold miner but was unsuccessful and relocated to Queensland some two years later where he turned to coal mining in the West Moreton district. This time his venture was such a success that he opened up many of the coalfields in the area and with the building of railways across Queensland the demand for coal become even greater, earning him a vast fortune and eventually became known as the 'Coal King'. In 1890, Thomas retired from mining and handed over the business to his employees, who formed the Aberdare Co-Operative Coal Co. Ltd. Political career Thomas, representing the Ministerial Party, was a candidate for the seat of Bundamba at the 1893 colonial election. He easily defeated the sitting member, Thomas Glassey, and remained as the member until he decided not to stand in the 1899 election. Three years later, Thomas was appointed by premier Robert Philp to the Queensland Legislative Council, remaining there until his death in 1913. Personal life In 1859, Thomas married Ann Morris at Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn and together had 1 daughter, Mary, who grew up to marry Thomas Cribb Jr., the son of Thomas Bridson Cribb, the then Treasurer of Queensland. He had a great love of music, and for many years sponsored the annual Queensland Eisteddfodau, to which he gave between ¬£60 to ¬£100 to the chief choral contest. He was also patron of the Blackstone-Ipswich Cambria Choir and was often seen at the festivals in which they competed. An aerial view of Brynhyfryd mansion at Blackstone, Ipswich, ca. 1930 Thomas was a trustee of the Ipswich Girls' Grammar School and also donated the annual 'Thomas Lewis Scholatship' to the boys Grammar School. Around 1905, Lewis was on a tour back to Wales, and while there he donated ¬£1000 to establish a scholarship at the Aberystwyth University.The Thomas Lewis Scholarship -- What Uni?. Retrieved 28 March 2015. In 1890, Thomas built 'Brynhyfryd Mansion' at Blackstone. It was an elaborate home, three stories high and containing 49 rooms including a basement and a tower. It was built on top of a rich coal seam, and while Thomas was alive, refused to mine the coal as it would mean having to demolish his home. After his death his wife, daughter, and her husband continued to live there and it was eventually sold in 1934 to Rylance Collieries and Brickworks who demolished the mansion in 1937 to mine the coal deposits below.Site of former Brynhyfryd Mansion for sale -- Old estates for sale.

Snaregade extends from the small square at the Gammel Strand metro station to Knabrostr√¶de where it turns into Magstr√¶de. The streets are among the few streets in the Old Town of Copenhagen which still feature their original cobbling. Magstr√¶de is associated with Huset i Magstr√¶de (\\"The House in Magstr√¶de\\"), now officially referred to as Huset KBH (\\"The House CPH\\"\\", \\"CPH\\" being short for \\"Copenhagen\\"), a culture house. History Gedde's map of Copenhagen Magstr√¶de in 1834, painting by Edvard Lehmann Magstr√¶de was created in the 1520s when the coastline was moved to present day Nyropgade. The first part of the name, Mag-, is an old word for a lavatory, referring to a public latrine, Vestre Mag (\\"Western Mag\\"), which was located at the site. Another one, √òstre Mag (Eastern Mag\\"), was located at the end of Hyskenstr√¶de. Snaregade received its current name in 1607. It takes its name after Erling Jonss√∏n Snare, a former member of the city council who had owned a property on the street from 1501.

All the other houses in the street date from after the fire in 1795. No. 4 is from 1902 and was built by Jacob Laurids Thrane. No. 6 (1799) and No. 8 (1807) were built by Poul Egeroed. No. 10 is from 1808 and was built by Johan Martin Quist. Magstr√¶de The oldest building in the street is the symmetrical house at No. 17-19 which dates from the 1640s. No. 20 also dates from the time before the fire of 1728. The Sch√§ffer House (No 6), also called Hofsnedkerens G√•rd (\\"The Court Carpenter's House\\"), was built by Philip de Lange in 1733-34 for Court Carpenter Diderich Sch√§ffer who had been called to Denmark to work on Christiansborg Palace. Sch√§ffer's rich interior Rococo decorations from his house are now on display in the National Museum. It is five bays wide and has a three-bay central projection. The rounded pediment was added in 1850. Sch√§ffer also owned Sch√¶fferg√•rden at J√¶gersborg north of Copenhagen. No. 11 is a former warehouse from before 1797.

A supporter of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and his policies, Skwarczynski also was a Freemason and a publicist. Adam Skwarczy≈Ñski Skwarczynski was born on 3 December 1886 in the village of Wierzchnia, near Kalusz, Austrian Galicia (today Ukraine). He was raised in a patriotic family: his father Wincenty Skwarczynski fought in the January Uprising, his mother Maria (n√©e Gnoiska) was the daughter of a soldier of the November Uprising. After the death of Wincenty Skwarczynski (1888), whole family moved to Lw√≥w, where Adam, as a teenager, joined Polish independence organizations. A conservative, Skwarczynski was influenced by left-wing writers, such as Edward Abramowski. While in Lw√≥w, he met J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. After graduation from high school Skwarczynski began studies at Lw√≥w University, as he planned to be a teacher of the Polish language. In the late 1900s, he completed officer course at a military college of the Union of Active Struggle (ZWC). He joined the ZWC and was a lecturer in the college. In 1910, he joined the Riflemen's Association, at the same time becoming a teacher at Rohatyn. Skwarczynski also published his articles in several local newspapers and magazines. Before the outbreak of World War One, he returned to Lw√≥w. In the summer of 1914, he joined 1st Brigade, Polish Legions. As a staff officer, he fought in the area of Kielce, and was later transferred to intelligence department of the Polish Legions in World War I. In May 1915, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski sent him to former Russian Poland, to look for volunteers, willing to join the Legions. Skwarczynski then joined Polish Military Organisation, and settled in Warsaw. Arrested by the Germans, he was sent to Modlin Fortress, to be released on November 12, 1918. In early 1919, Skwarczynski began working for Gazeta Polska daily, becoming its editor in chief. He also worked for other publications, such as ‚ÄúGovernment and Nation‚Äù and ‚ÄúNation‚Äù, and wrote a brochure ‚ÄúThe purpose of the war in the East‚Äù, in which he stated that Poland has a peaceful mission to fulfill in Ukraine and Lithuania. In the early 1920s, he married Anna (n√©e Pradzynska), and together with Adam Koc, Janusz Jƒôdrzejewicz and Tadeusz Ho≈Ç√≥wko founded the ‚ÄúRoad‚Äù (‚ÄúDroga‚Äù) monthly magazine. In 1925, he issued a pamphlet, in which he harshly criticized General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, who was regarded as one of main opponents of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. During the 1926 May Coup, Skwarczynski supported Pi≈Çsudski. At that time, he wrote several press articles about moral revolution (see Sanation), which should be introduced in Poland. After the coup, Skwarczynski was employed in the chancellary of the President of Poland. In 1929, due to a Tuberculosis infection, both his legs were amputated. Nevertheless, he remained a very active person, organizing anti-Endecja youth organizations, and supporting the creation of Central Committee of the Country Youth and Association of Country Colleges. Adam Skwarczynski died on 2 April 1934 in Warsaw, and was buried at PowƒÖzki Cemetery. In Communist Poland, all his publications were banned.

History  In 1939, Sn. H.H.B.V. Narasimha Swamiji, Sri. C.Varadaraja Ayyah, Sri A.V. K. Chari started the Sai movement in Coimbatore. The temple was established in 1939. The Institution named for Sri Saibaba Mutt was put up darsana of the Devotees. Swamiji entrusted the center to the care of Sri. A.V. K. Chari. In 1942, the late Sn. C.Varadaraja Ayyah donated around one acre of land on Mettupalayam Road, and Thatched Shed was evicted from the donated land meant to house the Sri Sai Baba Mission- later named Sri Sai Baba Madam. The place was opened for worship to everyone regardless of class, creed, caste or religion. The Sai Baba Madam was the meeting ground of Sai Devotees in and around Coimbatore. Sai Bhajans were held regularly on Sundays and Thursdays. A marble statue of Shirdi Sai Baba was installed by Sathya Sai Baba (the Indian guru thought to have been the reincarnation of Shirdi Sai Baba himself) on February26,1961. This was the first time that Sathya Sai Baba formally installed an idol of Shirdi Sai Baba for daily worship. The temple is called Naga Sai Mandir after a story told by Shirdi Sai Baba‚Äôs followers of a snake, N√£ga, that rose from the flowers in the garden to listen to Shirdi Sai when he was giving darshan to devotees before disappearing.

Background In early March 2014, ISIL surrounded the Koban√Æ Canton and launched an offensive on its southern villages, capturing the town of Sarrin. On 2 July 2014, the city of Koban√Æ and its border villages came under attack from fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). However, ISIL forces were largely repelled from the remainder of the Koban√Æ Canton. On 13 September 2014, ISIL launched a massive offensive to take the Koban√Æ Canton and the city of Koban√Æ, with at least 4,000 fighters, During the advance, ISIL forces captured the villages of Robey and Tall Ghazal, and the nearby grain silos. pushing into the villages at the western and eastern borders of the Canton. On 17 September 2014, following the capture of a strategic bridge over the Euphrates on 16 September, In response to the growing crisis, the US-led Coalition began conducting airstrikes in and around Koban√Æ on 26 September, continuing for five days, until 2 October, during which the US performed no strikes on that day, before reportedly carried out further strikes late on 3 October. By early October 2014, most of the Koban√Æ Canton had fallen under ISIL control, with the city of Koban√Æ itself besieged, causing at least 90% of the Kurdish inhabitants in the region to flee to Turkey. By mid-October 2014, at least 9,000 militants had been dispatched to capture Koban√Æ, and at least 400,000 Kurdish civilians had fled to Turkey. In late October 2014, Turkey allowed some Free Syrian Army and Peshmerga reinforcements to cross over into Koban√Æ, allowing the Kurdish defenders to counter the ISIL advance. By mid-November 2014, the YPG and other defenders had managed to make some reversals in Koban√Æ city. On 19 January 2015, the YPG-led forces captured the strategic Mistanour Hill to the southeast of Koban√Æ city, allowing the Kurdish forces to turn the tide of the battle. During the next week, the YPG-led forces gradually advanced, before fully expelling ISIL from Koban√Æ city on 27 January 2015. ISIL admitted defeat in the city three days later, but vowed to return. At that time, ISIL redeployed much of its initial invasion force to other \\"more important fronts\\". After retaking Koban√Æ city, the YPG and FSA launched an offensive to retake the rest of the Koban√Æ Canton. Consequently, ISIL dispatched reinforcements to the region, to prevent the Kurdish-led forces from reaching the ISIL-held territory in the northern Aleppo Governorate, and to prevent them from reaching the ISIL capital of Raqqa. On 10 February 2015, the YPG built on their recent gains and launched an assault on Sarrin from the northwest.Kobani Canton Situation Map: 10 February 2015 Despite being stalled for nearly 2 weeks, the Kurdish forces nearly reached the western outskirts of the town of Sarrin in late February 2015.Kobani Conflict Map: 24 February 2015 However, on 27 February, an ISIL counter-attack drove the YPG away from Sarrin, back to Qara Qozak, just beyond the M5 Highway.Kobani Situation: 27 February 2015 Despite this setback, YPG-led forces slowly continued advancing in other parts of the canton, capturing Qara Qozak on 15 March, recapturing most of the territory lost to ISIL during their September 2014 offensive, with the exception of three villages in the southern part of the Canton near Jill, and a few dozen villages captured by ISIL in the eastern Koban√Æ Canton and the northwestern Raqqa Governorate. The assault thumbleftupright=1.2The situation after the end of ISIL's siege of the Koban√Æ Canton, on 29 April 2015. Most of ISIL's advances since September 2014 had been reversed, and YPG- led forces were battling for control of Sarrin. Initial advance and ISIL counterattack Between 17 and 19 March, the YPG seized a hill overlooking Sarrin, the last remaining ISIL stronghold in the southern part of the Koban√Æ Canton. ISIL gathered reinforcements and massed its forces near Sarrin, to prevent Kurdish and allied forces from reaching the town, while the US-led Coalition conducted numerous airstrikes in the area. The clashes on 18 March resulted in the deaths of at least 27 ISIL militants. On 20 March, the YPG and the allied Euphrates Volcano, backed by Coalition air support, launched an assault towards Sarrin, which led to hit-and-run fighting until 28 March. On 21 March, YPG and FSA forces completely besieged the Sarrin Grain Silo. A total of 71 ISIL militants and 1 FSA fighter were killed during the clashes and Coalition strikes. On the night between 22 and 23 March, ISIL dispatched reinforcements to Sarrin, across the Tishrin Dam, which the Coalition did not target, due to the risks that destroying the dam would pose to those living downstream. On 25 March, ISIL forces attacked the village of Qara Qozak by boat, but the attack was repelled by the YPG and airstrikes struck the gathered ISIL forces on the other side of the river. The clashes left at least 71 ISIL militants and 4 YPG fighters dead. Two days later, fighting in the southern villages of Sebti and Khani left three ISIL militants dead. On 28 March, ISIL launched a counter-attack and managed to break through the Kurd's M4 highway defensive line and reach ISIL fighters at the Grain Silos, and at the Lafarge Cement Plant, near the southeastern boundary of the Koban√Æ Canton, where the militants had been besieged for almost two weeks. On the next day, YPG fighters began shelling ISIL positions in Sarrin. In early April, ISIL continued forcing Kurdish forces back from the outskirts of Sarrin, to the north and the northwest towards Qara Qozak. Still, the YPG continued to hold the higher ground in the area. Eventually, the ISIL advance cut the M4 highway between Dar Al-Kharab and Mitras and allowed the jihadists to reinforce their positions at the Sarrin Grain Silos. By 9 April, ISIL forces, after receiving more reinforcements, broke across the M4 highway near Mitras and the Grain Silos, and at Nur Ali and Hamdoun, to the east. Besieging Sarrin In mid- April, a YPG counter-offensive, aided by US-led Coalition airstrikes, allowed the YPG-led forces to advance towards Sarrin again. On 13 April 2015, the YPG massed reinforcements to take over the Sarrin Grain Silos, retaking the village of Manifa Avi in the process. On 19 April, YPG forces captured the village of Ras al Ayn, allowing the Kurds to sever ISIL's supply line to Sarrin from the east, and effectively besieging the town from both the east and the west.YPG Capture of Ras al Ayn Severs ISIL Supply Lines to Sarrin The clashes resulted in the deaths of at least 10 ISIL militants. Also, YPG-led forces began attacking the last ISIL supply route to Sarrin, which lay south of the town.Kobani Canton: 20 April 2015 On 21 April, YPG and allied forces had retaken the territory lost to ISIL up to the M4 Highway, capturing the Sarrin Grain Silos, Septe, and the other neighboring villages, allowing YPG forces to resume their southward advance towards Sarrin.Kobani Canton Situation Map: 21 April 2015 However, on the next day, it was reported that the Sarrin Grain Silos was still held by around 50 ISIL militants, but that a ‚Äúnear total‚Äù siege had been imposed on them.

The YPG claimed that ISIL forces had retreated into the urban areas of the town. According to at least one source, YPG and FSA forces managed to enter the northern part of Sarrin.Sarrin Battle Map: 26 April 2015 As of 27 April, ISIL forces in Sarrin continued receiving more reinforcements from the south, which caused the YPG-led offensive in Sarrin to stall at that point. Meanwhile, recurring ISIL attacks to the north on the village of Mitras, which started early on 22 April, were repelled, while up to 50 ISIL fighters were still holding out at the Grain Silos. Aftermath Early on 29 April 2015, the last 124 Peshmerga fighters stationed in Koban√Æ returned to Iraqi Kurdistan, as the city had been secured. Iraqi Kurdistan also stated that no more troops would be sent to Koban√Æ. On 9 May 2015, it was reported by local sources that ISIL commander Abu Omar al-Shishani was personally leading the ISIL ground forces in Sarrin. By 11 May, after several more days of repeated breakout attempts from Khirbat al-Burj and the Sarrin Grain Silos, it was reported that the number of remaining ISIL militants in those two YPG- besieged pockets had dwindled significantly. In mid-May 2015, it was revealed that the YPG sieges of the Sarrin Grain Silos and Khirbat al-Burj were not completely secure, as ISIL was infiltrating fighters and supplies from Sarrin to the two besieged pockets. On 25 May, ISIL launched an assault to the north of Sarrin, breaking through Kurdish lines, capturing the villages of Mitras and Jabiriyah, and temporarily relieving the sieges of the Sarrin Grain Silos and Khirbat al-Burj. ISIL fighters also reduced Kurdish control of Sarrin to the western outskirts of the town.Kobani Canton conflict map: 25 May 2015 By 31 May, clashes erupted in the area that ISIL had recently captured, as YPG- led fighters attempted to retake the area.Kobani Canton conflict map: 31 May 2015 On 5 June, YPG-led fighters recaptured the village of Jabiriyah, to the east of Mitras, while clashes continued in the area stretching from Sarrin to the Sarrin Grain Silos. ISIL also retook the western part of the Sarrin, while YPG-led fighters pushed towards the eastern outskirts of the town.Kobani Canton conflict map: 5 June 2015 On 18 June 2015, it was reported that the FSA and YPG had launched a new offensive on the town of Sarrin. The goal of taking Sarrin became more crucial after the Koban√Æ massacre at the end of June.

It most likely originated in France or Spain (as triunfo) and later spread to the rest of Europe. When the game arrived in Italy, it shared a similar name with the pre-existing game and deck known as trionfi; probably resulting in the latter becoming renamed as Tarocchi (tarot). While trionfi has a fifth suit that acts as permanent trumps, triomphe randomly selects one of the existing four suits as trumps. Another common feature of this game is the robbing of the stock. Triomphe became so popular that during the 16th century the earlier game of trionfi was gradually renamed tarocchi, tarot, or tarock.Vitali, Andrea. Triumphs, Trionfini and Trionfetti at Le Tarot Cultural Association. Retrieved 17 February 2017. This game is the origin of the English word \\"trump\\" and is the ancestor of many trick-taking games like Euchre (via √âcart√©) and Whist (via Ruff and Honours). Spanish rules The earliest surviving description was written by Juan Luis Vives in his Exercitatio linguae latinae around 1538 in Basel. As he left Spain in 1509 never to return, the rules may date to his youth. However the game was already widespread by then. In 1541, Juan Maldonado (d. 1554) expanded on Vives's rules and later revised them in 1549. Both Vives and Maldonado described the rules in the form of dialogues between the players. It is an ancestor of Ombre. The game is played by four players either individually or as partners. Maldonado uses a pack of 48 Spanish playing cards but Vives uses a French deck by discarding the 10s. In the suit of clubs and swords, the ranking from highest to lowest is King, Knight, Jack, 9 ... Ace while in the suit of cups and coins it is King, Knight, Jack, Ace ... 9. In the trump suit, the Ace is promoted above the King. Partners are chosen by drawing cards from the deck with the two highest and the two lowest going together. They sit opposite of one another. Each player is dealt nine cards with the top card of the remaining stock of 12 flipped to reveal the trump suit. If the exposed card is an Ace or a face card, the dealer has the right to exchange it for a card in his hand and get awarded three points. Players must follow suit, if devoid of that suit then they can play trumps or a card from another suit. Players with a weak hand can concede at any time and force a redeal but this is considered losing that particular hand. This game was used for gambling with players raising stakes before each trick. Each card is worth 1 point and points are counted after each trick, if a side neglects to add points then they are not counted. The side that wins a hand gets their points for that particular hand doubled. The first side to obtain 32 points wins. English rules Hugh Latimer referred to the game of \\"Triumph\\" in 1529. The game is played in Gammer Gurton's Needle, a comedy written around 1553 and William Shakespeare also mentioned the game in Antony and Cleopatra (c. 1607).Gammer Gurton's Needle at Project Gutenberg. Retrieved 30 January 2018. An incomplete description of \\"Trumpe\\" was provided by Jacques Bellot, a Huguenot from Caen residing in London, in his Familiar Dialogues (1586). Like Vives and Maldonado, the game is described in a dialogue. He describes a four- player partnership game where the one who cuts the highest card becomes the dealer. Twelve cards are commonly dealt counterclockwise to each player but his characters opt for a shorter game of nine cards. The dealer cuts the stock to reveal the trump suit. The player who holds the ace of trumps gets to rob the stock. Only trumps have value. Kings are high and worth 6, queens 4, jacks 2, and all other trumps 1. Players declare their trumps before trick-taking takes place. The game is abruptly interrupted, leaving the rest of the rules a mystery.Familiar Dialogues (excerpt, 1586) at jducoeur.org. Retrieved 17 February 2017. German rules Incomplete rules from Strasbourg when it was still part of the Holy Roman Empire were recorded in both French and German (as Tr√ºmpfspiel) in 1637. Its rules are similar to the Dutch game of Troeven (\\"Trumps\\"). Aces are high and deuces are low. Each player takes a card from the deck; the lowest becomes the dealer. The dealer passes out nine cards to each player with the remaining cards forming the stock. The dealer exposes one card from the stock which will be the trump suit. If the dealer exposes an ace, he can exchange a worthless card for it. He can do the same with the remainder of the stock taking any trumps until he exposes a non-trump. The highest trump cards are fixed: the Ace of Hearts, the King of Diamonds, the Queen of Spades, and the Jack of Clubs. The object of each hand is to capture cards with the most points. Aces are worth four, kings three, queens two, and jacks one; in total there should be 40 points. If a player achieves a slam (winning all the tricks), he will get 80 points. French rules Though Triomphe can be traced back to the 1480s in France, the earliest surviving rules date to 1659. French Triomphe was played by four players divided into two partnerships with a 52-card deck.Cotton, Charles, The Compleat Gamester (reprint of 1674 original) The order of the cards from highest to lowest is King, Queen, Jack, Ace, 10, 9 ... 2. Each player takes a card from the deck, the one with the highest card becomes the dealer and passes five cards face down to everyone. The remaining 32 cards form the stock. The dealer then turns up a card from the stock, the suit of that card will be the trump suit. An optional rule is that the player with the Ace of trumps gets to exchange the exposed card with one from his hand. He can do the same with the remainder of the stock taking any trumps until he exposes a non-trump.Parlett, David, Euchre:Five-trick trump games. Retrieved 9 December 2016. This is called robbing the stock. If the dealer exposes an ace as the trump, then he gets the right to rob the stock. The current dealer picks the next dealer out of the opposing team. The object of each hand is to win at least three tricks. Winning three or four tricks awards one point while winning all five tricks is worth two points. The first team to get five points wins the game. The eldest to the right of the dealer sets the first trick's suit with the winner of each trick leading to the next one. All players must follow suit if possible. Trumps must be used if void of the trick's suit. If the next player is also void, then she must over-trump if possible. If void in suit and trumps, then any card can be played but won't win. Since there are only 20 cards in play, any attempt to cheat by revoking is easily caught and the culprit loses the game. Since the 18th century, the game has been played with a 32-card stripped deck.La Triomphe (French) at Acad√©mie des jeux oubli√©s.

Formally inaugurated in 1955, it is headquartered in an 1890s palace in the city center. Topics of its permanent exhibits include history, ecology, folk art and minerals. Additionally, a fine arts gallery is located in the former city hall, while three other sites elsewhere in the county are also administered by the museum. Background and description The museum is headquartered at 44 Armand CƒÉlinescu Street, in the former Arge»ô County Administrative Palace. The structure was built in 1898‚Äì1899 according to the plans of architect Dimitrie Maimarolu, while Mihail Manolescu was prefect. The land previously belonged to the Buliga skete, and the funds for construction came in the form of a loan of 140,000 lei from a Bucharest bank, guaranteed by the Dimitrie Sturdza-led Liberal government. Done in an eclectic style, it fits within the framework of French academicism. The plan is symmetric and U-shaped, with a basement, ground floor and second floor; the building forms an imposing presence in the city center. The grooved columns are both Ionic and composite. The pediment features symbolic bas-reliefs and acroteria. The cornices are denticulate, there is egg-and-dart moulding, as well as meanders, decorative balustrades, semicircular niches, bossage in strong relief and medallions. Local artist Iosef Materna painted the ceiling of the staircase hall. The building housed the Arge»ô County Prefecture from 1899 to 1950, the Arge»ô Region Council from 1950 to 1968 and the Arge»ô County Council from 1968 to 1970. It has been used by the museum since 1970, and is considered a historic monument by the country's Culture Ministry, Enciclopedia Arge»ôului »ôi Muscelului ‚Äì P , at the University of Pite»ôti Enciclopedia Arge»ôului »ôi Muscelului site , p. 191-92 as are the adjacent park and public garden. The museum's roots lie in the Gheorghe Ionescu-Gion Popular Athenaeum, which was hosted by a Pite»ôti primary school from 1928 to 1946, and by the Arge»ô Cultural Center from 1948 to 1950. From 1950 to 1955, its collections were kept in storage. The museum as such was founded in 1955, and was located in the Arge»ô Tribunal or Cultural Palace from 1955 to 1957 and in the Fostiropol House or Popular Art School from 1957 to 1970, before moving to its present location. The building was expanded in 2000 and in 2004. Permanent exhibitions include fine arts (1971‚Äì), folk art (1971‚Äì), history (1974‚Äì), ecology and environmental protection (1977‚Äì), sports (2008‚Äì), a planetarium (2008‚Äì), mineral crystals (2009‚Äì), numismatics (2009‚Äì) and an astronomical observatory. There are storage spaces as well as restoration laboratories. Annexes Other sites administered by the museum include the Dacian Castrum of Jidava in C√¢mpulung (1969‚Äì), the Dinu Lipatti House at Ciolce»ôti (1985‚Äì) and Poenari Castle at Arefu (2009‚Äì). The museum formerly had charge of D√¢mbovicioara Cave (1960‚Äì2002) and the Liviu Rebreanu Memorial House at Valea Mare (1969‚Äì2008). The museum has a photographic archive and runs archaeological digs. It also has a specialized library (1957‚Äì), a journal (1968‚Äì), an annual scientific conference (1970‚Äì) and a publishing house (2007‚Äì). Enciclopedia Arge»ôului »ôi Muscelului ‚Äì M , at the University of Pite»ôti Enciclopedia Arge»ôului »ôi Muscelului site , p. 123 While the folk art section is located in the main building, the fine arts gallery, named after Rudolf Schweitzer-CumpƒÉna, has been housed since 1970 at the old city hall on 33 Republicii Boulevard. The building is itself a historic monument, as is the abutting park. Planned by architect Ion N. Socolescu and built in 1885‚Äì1886, it is in the French style of the time, with a ground floor and upper story. The main entrance is surrounded by four columns, the central hallway has a wide staircase, and the interior features decorative elements such as stucco ornamentation. The ceiling of the former city council room was also painted by Materna.

At one stage, it was owned by the Knatchbull- Hugueson family. The widowed Constance Borgstr√∂m n√©e Paterson (from Finland) started to live there as a tenant in the 1890s.

History It resulted from a commission by the Jesuit church of Santa Mar√≠a del Pilar de Calatayud, now known as San Juan el Real. After the Jesuits were expelled from Spain in 1767, the painting went to the sanctuary of the Virgin of Jaraba, where it was rediscovered in 1985. Description It shows saint Aloysius Gonzaga being consecrated as the patron saint of young people by pope Benedict XIII, who taught young Italians to take the saint as their example, as indicated by the Latin words on the pope's speech-bubble \\"Inspice, FAC ET secundum EXEMPLAR\\" (Look and follow his example). The pope points at the saint, who appears in glory in Jesuit robes among angels and bearing a bouquet of lilies, alluding to his purity. Goya was probably influenced by his tutor Joseph Luz√°n.

The map is made by equally dividing a spherical surface into 96 triangles, transferring it to a tetrahedron while maintaining area proportions, and unfolding it onto a rectangle. The map substantially preserves sizes and shapes of all continents and oceans while it reduces distortions of their shapes, as inspired by the Dymaxion map. The projection does not have some of the major distortions of the Mercator projection, like the expansion of countries in far northern latitudes, and allows for Antarctica to be displayed accurately and in whole. Triangular world maps are also possible using the same method. The name is derived from \\"authalic\\" and \\"graph\\". The method used to construct the projection ensures that the 96 regions of the sphere that are used to define the projection each have the correct area, but the projection does not qualify as equal-area because the method does not control area at infinitesimal scales or even within those regions. The AuthaGraph world map can be tiled in any direction without visible seams. From this map-tiling, a new world map with triangular, rectangular or a parallelogram's outline can be framed with various regions at its center. This tessellation allows for depicting temporal themes, such as a satellite's long-term movement around the earth in a continuous line. In 2011 the AuthaGraph mapping projection was selected by the Japanese National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation (Miraikan) as its official mapping tool. In October 2016, the AuthaGraph mapping projection won the 2016 Good Design Grand Award from the Japan Institute of Design Promotion.

An army of the Western Roman Empire, led by the general Ricimer, drove off an invading force, a fleet of sixty ships, sent by the Vandal king Gaiseric to raid Sicily. Ricimer then led the Roman fleet against the Vandals and defeated them in a naval battle off the coast of Corsica. The victory gave the Romans only temporary relief from Vandal raids. Prelude The Vandals led by their king Gaiseric (sometimes spelled Genseric) had earlier conquered North Africa after passing through Spain, frequently raided prosperous cities or areas of the European coast and sacked Rome in 455 A.D. In spring or early summer of 456 A.D., Ricimer led an army and navy of Romans, auxiliaries, and Germanic foederati to Sicily with the intention of repelling a known or suspected forthcoming Vandal attack. Battle The Vandals initially forced the Romans onto the defensive in a partly forested battlefield. The Vandals were unable to break Ricimer's troops and after a hard fought battle, the Romans drove off the Vandal force. The Vandals who survived the battle boarded their ships which sailed north toward Corsica. Ricimer followed the Vandals and defeated them in a naval battle off the coast of Corsica. Aftermath Ricimer returned home to Italy where he and the generals Majorian and Aegidius, seized power from the Western Roman emperor, Avitus.

The primary site was in Boscombe but for a period of time it was merged with a Westbourne site. The Westbourne site was the first named Royal Victoria Hospital of the two but the name was applied to both sites after merger in 1911. It has had several name changes during its history. History Royal Victoria Hospital c.1890 Early in May 1876 a dispensary scheme was launched in Bournemouth. This assisted those on low incomes to obtain treatment and medicines by means of a weekly subscription. In 1872 a formal decision was made to establish a 'branch hospital' for that purpose. In January 1877 it was announced that the premises were to be the permanent home of the dispensary, and were opened as the Boscombe, Pokesdown, and Springbourne Infirmary, with accommodation for twelve patients. This infirmary was the nucleus of Boscombe Hospital. In February 1877, the Boscombe Cottage Hospital and Provident Dispensary opened in Shelley Road Boscombe. It initially had beds for 12 patients. It was expanded dramatically over time. It was later variously identified as the Boscombe Hospital, Royal Boscombe Hospital or the Royal Boscombe Hospital and West Hants Hospital. The first named Royal Victoria Hospital of the two was at 17 Poole Road, Westbourne. The hospital was raised through public subscription and founded in 1887. The building was designed by Messrs Creeke & Gifford, in the Queen Anne style, and erected by Messrs George & Harding, growing from 38 to 50 beds. It was officially opened by the Prince of Wales, on 16 January 1890. In 1911, the two hospitals merged as the Royal Victoria and West Hants Hospital. The two sites were also simply identified as the Royal Victoria Hospital. Comedian and actor Tony Hancock's father died of cancer at the Royal Victoria Hospital (Boscombe site) in 1935. After the Second World War, the Royal Victoria Hospital (Westbourne site) became an Ear, Nose & Throat (ENT) Hospital. It was then renamed Westbourne Eye Hospital. The site was sold and the buildings converted into apartments around 2002. After services transferred to the Royal Bournemouth Hospital in 1989, most of the buildings forming the Royal Victoria Hospital (Boscombe site) were demolished in 1993. Some parts of the hospital are still in use as NHS Clinical Commissioning Group administrative offices and an ENT clinic. Sixteen of the original W. B. Simpson tile panels from the Boscombe site can be found mounted on the stairs of the Royal Bournemouth Hospital. The panels, which date from 1910, show nursery rhymes and fairy tales.

She is based in Brooklyn, New York. Early life and education Born in 1971, in Baltimore, Maryland, Smith's artistic training began in childhood, encouraged toward the creative arts by her mother, a fashion editor. She began studying ballet at age four, and later attended the Baltimore School for the Arts. In high school, Smith was influenced by artists in the Baltimore graffiti scene, an aesthetic also visible in her mature work. Her studies of Japanese calligraphy and abstraction in college also influenced her artistic development. After earning her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at Maryland Institute College of Art, Smith worked as a costumer and props assistant on movies such as Disclosure, Guarding Tess, Serial Mom, and That Night. From 1995‚Äì2000, Smith served on the Advisory Board of 911 Media Arts Center in Seattle, where she launched Seattle's first festival of African American film and video called Flav'a Fest. Described in the press as \\"an annual journey through the visions, lives and dreams of media makers of African ancestry,\\" the festival hosted films by emerging and established filmmakers such as Cheryl Dunye, Cauleen Smith, Barbara McCullough, Kasi Lemmons, and Charles Burnett (who was honored by Flav'a Fest and Seattle Mayor Norm Rice at a special screening of Killer of Sheep in 1997). After working in the film industry, Smith returned to her studies and earned a Master of Arts degree in Education from Tufts University in 2000 and a Master of Fine Arts degree from the Maryland Institute College of Art in 2003. In 2003, Smith moved to New York and participated in The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council's artist studio residency, where she began making sculpture. Art and career An exhibit of Smith's work at the David Castillo Gallery Shinique Smith combines fine art media with text, bright colors, and found objects, such as stuffed animals and clothing. She began to include used clothing in her work after reading a New York Times Magazine article about secondhand garments shipped to Africa from thrift stores. She describes her process as a personal one: \\"It all begins with emotion, an expression and I allow myself to go on a journey in the making of each work, a journey of associations between object and color, between lyrics and fabric, between the viewer and me.\\"shinique smith Smith's art has been described as \\"kaleidoscopic,\\" collecting \\"the vibrant, carefully collected debris of her life and career\\" and creating \\"graceful yet forceful combinations of many different materials and ideas.\\" The Frist Art Museum has interpreted Smith's work as conveying her personal history as well as \\"a greater sense of cultural concern and connectivity.\\" Her work gained critical attention when The Studio Museum of Harlem exhibited her first bale sculpture in Frequency in 2005, an exhibition that helped launch the careers of other artists of Smith's generation such as Nick Cave, Kalup Linzy, Xaviera Simmons, and Hank Willis Thomas. Smith's sculptural works were also prominently featured in the acclaimed launch exhibition of the New Museum, Unmonumental: The Object in the 21st Century, which featured works by Sam Durant, Urs Fischer, Isa Genzken, Elliott Hundley, and Jim Lambie to name a few. Smith's art was featured in 30 Americans, an exhibition of works by African American artists (including Jean-Michel Basquiat, Rashid Johnson, Kerry James Marshall, Lorna Simpson, Mickalene Thomas, Carrie Mae Weems, and Kehinde Wiley among others) in the permanent collection of the Rubell Museum in Miami that has toured extensively since 2009 and been a favored by critics and viewers at many museums across the U.S. Since these exhibitions, Smith's works have been exhibited at numerous venues internationally, including a recent 2014 survey of her work BRIGHT MATTER at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, where Jen Mergel, Senior Curator of Contemporary Art described the palette of Smith's works in the exhibition and use of found materials as \\"a product of United States culture especially from the 1980s.\\" Mergel said the exhibition \\"reflects an essential aspect of Smith's practice: how to visually manifest emotional connection, belief and the resilience of human energy through gestures and materials that shape daily life. Her work is an embodiment of the powerful spectrum of expression that for Smith, leans toward joy. Also in 2014, Smith was commissioned by The Rose F. Kennedy Greenway in Boston to create a mural for their rotating exhibition wall. Smith's work, Seven Moon Junction was nationally recognized as one of the Best Public Art Projects Annually by Americans for the Arts Public Art Year in Review. The Greenway also commissioned Smith to create an accompanying dance performance video, Gesture III: One Great Turning, a collaboration with Boston-based KAIROS Dance Theater, which was filmed on The Greenway in front Smith's mural.

The wing consists of three squadrons and a wing staff, and employs over 1,300 active-duty sailors and 100 contractors to provide maintenance, security, operations, administration, training and logistic support for the E-6 Mercury aircraft fleet. The E-6B Mercury enables the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense to directly contact submarines, bombers and missile silos enforcing the country's national security through nuclear deterrence. The Wing provides a secure communications link designed to for use in the event of nuclear war or other major incident in order to maintain communications between the decision makers comprising the National Command Authority (NCA) and the triad of U.S. strategic nuclear weapon delivery systems, i.e., manned bombers, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). The wing's primary mission is to receive, verify and retransmit Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) to US strategic forces. With the retirement of the USAF EC-135 Looking Glass airframe, the E-6 Mercury upgraded with the Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) have also assumed the airborne command post mission for the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM).

Four general censuses were held in the Ottoman Empire. These were 1831 census, 1881‚Äì82 census, 1905‚Äì06 census, and 1914 census. There were many special census, which Istanbul (Capital) is well known. There is considerable evidence that the census was taken throughout the empire, but it was accomplished under such severe difficulties that its results must be considered no more than estimates. The census takers were untrained and mostly unsupervised.  Types   General Census  Sultan Mahmut II recorded the first general census as part of his effort to create a new army (Nizam-ƒ± Cedid Army) and bureaucracy, a period known as Nizam-ƒ± Cedid, following the destruction of the Janissary Corps, known as Auspicious Incident, in 1826. The first Ottoman general census was completed in 1831. To provide general supervision and control and to compile and keep empire-wide population records, a separate Census Department (Ceride-i Nufus Nezareti) was established for the first time as part of the Ministry of the Interior. The 1831 census remained the only empire-wide count for official and private use for at least fifteen years, that was the beginning of Tanzimat. The Tanzimat provincial reforms included provisions for census counts as part of the process by which the tax and property systems were reformed. In fact that is a system, for military and tax which state based its existence, which constantly updated and provided very accurate population change. Local mayors (muhtars) and millet religious officers were assigned locally to count the people, to announce and enforce state regulations, and, ultimately, to issue the census receipts (niifus tezkeresi) and travel permits (murur tezkeresi) which became the basis for population control as well as for the count in subsequent decades.  Special Census There were cities, regions that were essential to Ottomans. While empire-wide census reports performed only sporadically, these cities or regions had multiple tallies. The city Istanbul had tallies in 1835, 1838, 1844, and 1857. There are not yet been uncovered summaries distributed in Ottoman Archives (around the Europe and Middle East) after the dissolution and partitioning of the Empire.  Department of the Census  The organizational structure of the Department of the Census (Niifus-u Umumi Idaresi) was an independent unit (mudurluk) in the Ministry of the Interior. It was separated from the army, that had its own personal records, and cadastral, that tracked the values for taxation reasons, departments. Department of the Census was divided into three major bureaus: for correspondence (Tahrirat Kalemi), statistics (Ihsaiyat Kalemi), and archives (Evrak Kalemi), with an additional Forwarding Department (Irsalat Memuriyet) which cared for the dispatch and receipt of correspondence. Outside the main office in the capital, the district staffs headed by directors (nazir) were assigned to each provincial capital to direct the work of the officials stationed along the Administrative divisions of the Ottoman Empire.  Ottoman census system  Like the modern census system, the most important part is the initial compilation of permanent population registers (sicil-i niifus) in each village and each quarter of the larger towns and cities. Census scribes, in doing their job required to accompanied by the religious leaders and mayors, which the data recorded not just the name and characteristics of each person found in their districts, including for the first time their gender, \\"women\\" was included in the register sheet ahead of many counterparts. The registration form was standardized. Standard form had types based on the persons stated religion. Separate registers for each recognized millet. All register pages numbered consecutively and sealed so that false pages could not be substituted for the real ones. Instead of the empty pages left at the ends of the original registers in previous censuses, separate registers of daily census changes (vukuat) were now introduced, with the kaza and provincial administrative councils being required to certify their accuracy before the information was sent on to Istanbul for incorporation into the empire-wide statistics. Printed information certificates were now provided, and most of the fees went to the local informants so that reports would be regular and prompt. The census questions: *Place of birth *Gender (subsection for men; military status, the style of mustache, the style of beard) *Residence *Age *Craft or occupation *Marital status *Health *Religion  Population Certificate  Population Certificate was an important paper to hold for the subject of the Ottoman Empire. During census each person recorded and counted in return with a signed and sealed Population Certificate (Nufus Tezkeresi), more or less a receipt for the registration, which contained the same information set down in the register. All practical purpose Population Certificate served both as birth certificate and identity card and had to be produced in all governmental and legal dealings.

It is issued upon discovery of an unlawful event, and is due and payable subject only to any rights of review that may be available under the AMP's implementing scheme. It is regulatory in nature, rather than criminal, and is intended to secure compliance with a regulatory scheme, and it can be employed with the use of other administrative sanctions, such as demerit points and license suspensions. Nature AMPs differ from ordinary fines, such as those for parking tickets, in that, under the relevant legislation: #the AMP applies to a narrower segment of the general population (for example, a regulated industry); #imposing an AMP involves a number of steps, for instance, the person may first be given a warning and/or an opportunity to address the statutory decision-maker's concerns (that is, to comply with the scheme); #the decision to impose an AMP is made by a senior official such as a Director or a person designated by that Director; #the criteria to guide the determination whether to impose and how to set the amount of an AMP is set out; #within those criteria, the person empowered to levy the penalty may be given significant discretion to decide whether to impose an AMP and to determine the appropriate amount of the AMP; and #the reconsideration or review/appeal of an AMP by the statutory decision-maker and/or an independent, specialized tribunalis allowed. AMPs by jurisdiction United Kingdom Legislation enabling general schemes of fixed and variable monetary penaltiesin addition to other sanctionshas been introduced through Part 3 of the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008. Under the Road Traffic Act 1991and subsequently expanded under part 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004AMPs known as \\"penalty charge notices\\" have replaced fixed penalty notices where local authorities have adopted schemes of decriminalised parking enforcement. In some areas such as London, the challenge process for PCNs can be completed online, via the Internet. Canada In Guindon v Canada, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that AMPs are generally considered to be administrative in nature and thus not subject to the legal protections provided under s.11 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. They are held not to arise from criminal proceedings, as \\"the purpose ... is to promote honesty and deter gross negligence\\"Guindon, par. 62 and \\"it is rational that the state would only wish to impose a penalty on those who engage in misconduct knowingly, recklessly, or with a particular intention.\\"Guindon, par. 72 They also do not attract a true penal consequence, as \\"high administrative monetary penalties [are] required to encourage compliance with the administrative regime. The relevant question is not the amount of the penalty in absolute terms, it is whether the amount serves regulatory rather than penal purposes.\\"Guindon, par. 81 However, normal standards of judicial review continue to apply. In Guindon, the Federal Court of Appeal provided more guidance in its judgment as to when an administrative penalty would be considered disproportionate. The Ontario Court of Appeal has given a reasoned evaluation for a monetary penalty that arose from a securities proceeding, and the Administrative Tribunal of Quebec has recognized that a person can bring forward the \\"reasonable, prudent and diligent person\\" defence that exists in civil law against the imposition of AMPs., citing Excavation Ren√© St-Pierre Inc. c Qu√©bec, 2015 QCTAQ 02386 The Government of Canada has introduced various AMP schemes on a sector-by-sector basis,including the Aeronautics Act, the Customs Act, the Income Tax Act, the Employment Insurance Act and the Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Act although some agencies prefer to pursue ticketing schemes for specified summary offences, notably under the Contraventions Act. Ontario is considering creating a new AMP system to address minor offences that are currently prosecuted under its Provincial Offences Act. The Attorney General of Ontario has requested input into the new system being proposed. In response, some have suggested that, with proper planning, an online system would be more cost-efficient and promote easier access to justice for people in rural areas and for those with language barriers. However, some people fear that a new system will be cumbersome and will not allow access to justice.

He began his racing career in France as a three-year-old where he won the Prix du Prince d'Orange and the Prix du Conseil de Paris in 2010. He was later transferred to Dubai where he was based at Meydan Racecourse. He made occasional returns to compete in Europe and won the September Stakes in both 2013 and 2014. In March 2015 he won the world's most valuable race, the Dubai World Cup. Background Prince Bishop is a chestnut gelding bred in Ireland by Thurso Ltd. He was sired by Dubawi a top-class son of Dubai Millennium, whose wins included the Irish 2,000 Guineas and the Prix Jacques Le Marois. At stud, Dubawi has been a highly-successful breeding stallion, siring major winners such as Monterosso, Al Kazeem, Makfi, Lucky Nine and Night of Thunder. Prince Bishop's dam North East Bay was a North American-bred mare who finished unplaced in her only race. North East Bay was descended from Topsy, a half-sister to The Derby winner Teenoso and a close relative of Sir Percy, Harayir and Rule of Law. As a foal, Prince Bishop was consigned to the Tattersalls sale in November, where he was bought for 80,000 guineas by Meadowlands Bloodstock. He entered the ownership of Sheikh Mohammed and was sent into training in France with Andr√© Fabre. Racing career 2010: three-year-old season Prince Bishop made his racecourse debut at Chantilly Racecourse on 3 May 2010 when he finished third in a maiden race over 1600 metres. He finished unplaced in his next two starts before recording his first success over 2000 metres at Vichy Racecourse, winning by ten lengths on heavy ground. After winning at odds of 3/5 at Deauville-Clairefontaine Racecourse in August Prince Bishop was moved up in class to contest the Group Three Prix du Prince d'Orange at Longchamp Racecourse on 18 September. Ridden as in all of his previous races by Maxime Guyon he appeared outpaced in the early stages but produced a strong late run to win a four-way photo finish from Wealthy, Rajamah and Lancelot. Commenting on the winner, Guyon said \\"He's a very progressive colt and the soft ground suited him\\". Olivier Peslier took over the ride when Prince Bishop was matched against older horses for the first time in the Prix du Conseil de Paris at Longchamp on 17 October. he raced in fifth before taking the lead 200 metres from the finish and holding off the challenge of the favourite Cirrus des Aigles to win by a short neck. 2011: four-year-old season In early 2011, Prince Bishop was transferred to Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin in Dubai where he was trained by Saeed bin Suroor. He made little impact on the Tapeta surface at Meydan Racecourse, finishing fifth in the third round of the Al Maktoum Challenge and tenth behind Victoire Pisa in the 2011 Dubai World Cup. Later that year he returned to Europe and finished unplaced in the Winter Hill Stakes at Windsor Racecourse and the Stand Cup at Chester. On his final appearance of the season he was dropped in class and started at odds of 6/1 for the Listed Floodlit Stakes on the Polytrack surface at Kempton on 2 November. Ridden by Silvestre De Sousa he took the lead two furlongs from the finish, went clear of the field and won by three and three quarter lengths from Parlour Games. 2012: five-year-old season In 2012, Prince Bishop was campaigned exclusively at Meydan, and recorded his first win at the track when carrying top weight of 132 pounds to a five and a quarter length victory in a handicap race on 20 January. He finished fifth in the second round of the Al Maktoum Challenge and third in the third round of the series before running for the second time in the Dubai World Cup. Starting a 33/1 outsider he finished seventh of the thirteen runners, seven and a half lengths behind his stablemate Monterosso. 2013: six-year-old season As a six-year-old, Prince Bishop finished third to his stablemate Hunter's Light in the second and third rounds of the Al Maktoum Challenge. On Dubai World Cup Night he was moved up in distance to contest the Dubai Sheema Classic over one and a half miles on turf. Ridden by Mickael Barzalona he never looked likely to make a serious challenge and finished tenth of the eleven runners behind St Nicholas Abbey. Prince Bishop made his first appearance in Europe for twenty-two months when he contested the Group Three September Stakes at Kempton on 7 September. Ridden by Kieren Fallon started 7/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Royal Empire (winner of the Geoffrey Freer Stakes), Main Sequence and Masterstroke (Grand Prix de Deauville, third in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe). He tracked the leaders before producing a sustained run in the straight to catch Main Sequence in the final strides and win by a head. On his final run of the year, Prince Bishop ran very poorly in the St Simon Stakes on heavy ground at Newbury Racecourse, finishing tailed-off last of the eight runners. 2014: seven-year-old season Prince Bishop began his fifth season in the second round of the Al Maktoum Challenge at Meydan. Ridden by Fallon, he started at 14/1 and was the least fancied of the three Godolphin runners behind African Story and Hunter's Light. The other runners included Dunaden, Heavy Metal (Durban July Handicap), and Battle of Marengo (Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial). Fallon sent Prince Bishop into the lead 700 metres from the finish and stayed on in the straight to win by one and a quarter lengths from African Story. Prince Bishop faced African Story again in the third round of the challenge on 8 March and started 5/1 second favourite behind his stablemate. He raced in mid-division before taking the lead in the straight and winning by one and a quarter lengths from Sanshaawes with Joshua Tree in sixth and African Story in eighth. Three weeks later, Prince Bishop started at odds of 8/1 in his third bid for the Dubai World Cup. He started slowly, never looked likely, and finished ninth of the sixteen runners behind African Story. On his only European run of 2014, Prince Bishop attempted to repeat his 2013 success in the September Stakes at Kempton. He started at odds of 15/2 in a field headed by his stablemate Secret Number (winner of the Cumberland Lodge Stakes), with the other runners including Red Cadeaux ,(Hong Kong Vase) and Dandino (winner of the race in 2012). Ridden by Frederik Tylicki and carrying top weight of 138 pounds he took the lead a furlong out and won by two lengths from Secret Number. After the race Tylicki said, \\"He's not run for 161 days but he felt like there was a lot left. It was a very smart performance giving weight away in what was probably one of the best Group 3s you'll see\\". 2015: eight-year-old season Before the start of the 2015 season, the Tapeta surface at Meydan was removed and replaced with a dirt track. For the fifth year in succession, Prince Bishop began his campaign by contesting the Al Maktoum Challenge, finishing second by a head to Frankyfourfingers in the second round on 5 February. He started 6/4 favourite for the third leg on 7 March but failed by a neck to overhaul African Story with Frankyfourfingers in fourth place. On 28 March, Prince Bishop, ridden by William Buick, ran for the fourth time in the Dubai World Cup. The return to dirt saw a strong challenge from North America, and the betting was headed by the American Horse of the Year California Chrome at odds of 5/4 with the Donn Handicap winner Lea next in the market on 4/1. Japan was represented by the Japan Cup winner Epiphaneia and the Japanese dirt champion Hokko Tarumae. African Story was made an 8/1 chance to repeat his 2014 success whilst Prince Bishop started at odds of 14/1. He raced towards the rear of the field and appeared to be struggling as Hokko Tarumae set a strong pace from African Story and California Chrome. He began to make progress at half distance and moved up on the outside to challenge for the lead on the final turn. He overtook California Chrome 300 metres from the finish and drew away to win by two and three quarter lengths. After the race, Buick said, \\"I don‚Äôt go numb very often but I can‚Äôt explain what I‚Äôm feeling right now. He has a very unorthodox was of racing so I took him out of the kickback in the back and when I got onto California Chrome's tail, he picked up the bridle and ran on well in the end. He likes the surface now that he has the experience, he is better than he was. This is just nuts.\\" On 23 April, it was announced that Prince Bishop would be retired from racing. African Story was retired on the same day, and Saeed bin Suroor paid tribute to the pair, saying, \\"They were very tough and reliable racehorses... they could adapt quickly to their environment no matter where in the world they were taken to race.\\" Pedigree *Prince Bishop is inbred 4x4 to Mr. Prospector, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generations of his pedigree.

It is one of the most famous paintings by the painter. The common interpretation suggests that the scene depicts two lovers entwined in a bedroom, the man locking the door. The painting is preserved in the Louvre Museum, in the section of the Department of Paintings devoted to eighteenth-century French painting on the second floor of the Sully wing. It stands together with some of the most famous pictorial masterpieces of the same period, in a chronologically organized path. This painting, a true symbol of the libertine spirit of the 18th century, reflects the state of mind adopted by the painters of the era, notably that of Fran√ßois Boucher, one of Fragonard's teachers and a great representative of rococo painting.  History of the work   Commissioned work  The work was commissioned in 1773 by Louis-Gabriel V√©ri-Raionard, Marquis de V√©ri (1722‚Äì1785). Having been produced for such a reputable and demanding collector, this erotic painting, ostensibly light but asserting a real ambition, formed part of a collection of depictions that were amorous, at times coarse and yet eminently representative of the spirit of French society at a time when the Enlightenment movement was about to waver. The canvas seemed to unveil a profound revitalization of Fragonard's inspiration that first distinguished itself in historical paintings, in particular Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols, first prize of Rome 1752. The obtaining of this distinction allowed Fragonard to enjoy a great fame. His scenes of gallantry were extremely popular, and the nobility offered him many commissions, like that of Baron Saint-Julian for The Swing (1767). Originally, Fragonard had given The Bolt \\"a more suitable twin: The Contract,\\" itself following on from another called The Armoire. The painting, which belonged to the Marquis of V√©ri's collection, was brought to us thanks to the etching of Maurice Blot, who had, 8 years previously, made an etching of The Bolt. This print, considered as mediocre, had great success, however, attributable in large part to the fame of Fragonard. Indeed, a theory claimed that the two works, The Contract and The Bolt, constitute, along with another painting of Fragonard, The Armoire, the three chapters of a novel in which the heroes would be the two lovers. The Bolt illustrated the passion of the couple, The Armoire, the discovery of their affair and being caught in the act, and The Contract, their reconciliation. Pendant Adoration of the Shepherds (1775) The Bolt is often considered alongside a work of more sacred inspiration, The Adoration of the Shepherds (1775). This canvas, also commissioned by the marquis, was suggested by Fragonard himself. It shows Fragonard's will to revive holy artwork and draw contrast between two types of love: carnal or libertine love, belonging to the 18th century, and sacred, religious love.  Analysis   Source of inspiration and realization  Painting tall lover of the drawing Fragonard started by making several sketches and surveys of The Bolt. We suppose that the Master used models for the realization of his work, like he sometimes was used to, as could illustrate his canvas The Model's First Sitting. He also liked to draw his inspiration from writings of his time. Gault de Saint- Germain said about him that \\"Ariosto, Boccaccio, La Fontaine were his inspirers and his ingenious teachers, spiritual in the inventiveness, he got sometimes the freshness of the color of his inimitable models.\\" Just like Francis Boucher, Fragonard used a sublayer of printing red or gray, said \\"printer\\", like colorful background and this before putting the paint. This sublayer allowed to avoid medium absorbing the paint. After making sketch of the subject by an outline, he applied the paint in several superimposed layers. The stroke was fine, light but precise, nervous and effective. The stroke of Fragonard besides is easily recognizable by his spontaneity, his genius. Note the example of \\"figures de fantaisie\\" made, they say, in an hour and which reveal all the mastery of the painter.

She had a successful career as a painter at the turn of the century, exhibiting her works internationally and winning awards. She had a mental breakdown that caused a break in her career, and she returned to have a successful second career, creating modern watercolor paintings. She was a resident at three artist colonies, with notable artists, writers, and musicians. Sparhawk-Jones' works are in American art museums, including the Art Institute of Chicago, Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Museum of Modern Art. Personal life Family  Elizabeth was the daughter of Rev. John Sparhawk Jones, D.D. and Harriet Sterett Winchester, who grew up in Northern Baltimore County on the Clynmalira estate. John Sparhawk Jones was a clergyman at the Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church in Baltimore's Bolton Hill until 1890. The Sparhawk-Joneses moved to Philadelphia after John suffered a deep depression and he became the pastor of the Calvary Church in 1894. Her mother was a domineering woman who nonetheless believed in allowing children to follow their talents and interests. She introduced Elizabeth and her sister Margaret to classic literature. Both of her parents encouraged Elizabeth to pursue her interest in art, which began at about seven years of age. She won first place in a nationwide art contest as a child and left school at about 15 years of age to attend the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA). Sparhawk-Jones chose to hyphenate her last name, unlike her father or other members of her family. Sparhawk-Jones' first love was Morton Livingston Schamberg, who was a fellow artist and student at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Her parents, though, did not approve of her relationship with Schamberg, likely because he was Jewish. In 1906, she was persuaded by her parents to turn down the coveted two-year traveling scholarship from PAFA, which would have had her in Paris at the same time as Schamberg. Their relationship then ended. While the family of four was on vacation, Elizabeth's father died on August 20, 1910, in Vermont at Bread Loaf. That year, Margaret graduated from University of Pennsylvania with a Master's Degree. Margaret married Bayard Turnbull in Paris in October 1913 against her mother's wishes. Harriet pressed Elizabeth to side with her, which resulted in a strained relationship between the sisters for many years. Elizabeth became exhausted from her career efforts, the strain in the relationship with her sister Margaret, and family financial losses. Mental breakdown Sparhawk-Jones struggled with depression, like her father, and when she was not well she burned her paintings, which reduced the number of works available for sale. In 1913, Sparhawk-Jones had a mental breakdown and lived in the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane for three years. The experience was hard on her and she was forever changed. Sparhawk-Jones was terrified and lonely at the asylum, and may have been subject to opium or sedative drugs. She moved in with her mother after she was released from the hospital in 1916. Sparhawk-Jones dealt with the losses of her teacher William Merritt Chase, who died in 1916, and Morton Shamburg, who died in 1918. She said that she did not work as an artist for about 12 years. Relationships Lilla Cabot Perry, Edwin Arlington Robinson, 1916, Colby College Special Collections, Waterville, Maine Sparhawk-Jones appreciated the company of writers over other artists, and enjoyed the periods when she lived at artist retreats, like MacDowell Colony and Yaddo, which had resident writers, musicians, and artists. Edwin Arlington Robinson (1868‚Äì1935), a Pulitzer Prize winning poet, and Sparhawk-Jones visited the MacDowell Colony at the same times over a cumulative total of ten years. They had a romantic relationship in which she was in love with him, devoted to him, understood him, and did not press for a more intimate relationship. He called her Sparhawk and was courteous towards her. They had a relationship that D. H. Tracy described as \\"courtly, quiet, and intense.\\" When he died, Sparhawk-Jones attended his vigil and then painted several paintings in his memory. She described him as a charming, sensitive, and emotionally grounded man with high moral values. Sparhawk-Jones was a friend of Nancy Cox-McCormack, with whom she corresponded between 1935 and 1956, Marsden Hartley, and Hudson Walker (of the Hudson Walker Gallery). Sparhawk-Jones was known for her humor and wit, but confided in a 1964 oral history interview that she always felt lonely, preferring a quiet lifestyle. Residences Sparhawk-Jones lived part of her adult life in and around Philadelphia, including the rural Westtown, Pennsylvania. She visited Paris often for up to six months at a time, returning to spend time with her family. In the mid-1950s, she moved to Paris and lived there at least through the mid-1960s. She died in 1968 and is buried in the same cemetery as her sister and her parents in northern Baltimore County, Maryland. Education Elizabeth Sparhawk-Jones, The Porch, 1907 Sparhawk-Jones studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA). From about 1900, when she was 15 through about 1903, when Thomas Anshutz, Charles Sheeler, and Morton Livingston Schamberg were there. Anshutz taught sketch classes with plaster cast models and dressed models. She received letters of encouragement and critiques by William Merritt Chase, who taught a portrait and life class. During one of the summers at PAFA, she studied in Paris at the Academie de la Grande Chaumiere, where she found the life drawing classes freer than in the United States. In Paris, models included adolescents and pretty young women, and there was an openness and comfort with nudity. Sparhawk-Jones attended Darby School of Painting at Fort Washington, under Anshutz, who was co-founder of the summer school and taught there through 1910. She learned modern art through Schamberg, who was a romantic interest at PAFA. Career Early career Elizabeth Sparhawk-Jones, Shoe Shop, 1911 Sparhawk-Jones was supporting herself through the sales of her oil and watercolor paintings by the time she was eighteen. She painted scenes of women reading or shopping as well as mothers and children walking through a park. Her Impressionist works, known for their vivid colors, were exhibited internationally in 1908, like the Carnegie Institute's international exhibition where she was the only woman to win anything and the only artist from the United States to receive an honorable mention. That year, The New York Times called her \\"the find of the year\\", having found her painting The Porch to be the \\"most unforgettable canvas\\" in the exhibition that they reviewed. Her use of color and expressive brush strokes were compared by art critics to William Merritt Chase's style. She exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and in 1908 and 1912 was awarded the Mary Smith Prize. The 1908 prize was won for Roller Skates and the 1912 prize was won for a painting of a flower shop in Paris entitled In the Spring, noted for its radiant colors. Sparhawk-Jones's portrait, painted by Alice Kent Stoddard before 1911, is in the collection of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Shoe Shop, which she painted in 1911, captures the chaotic shopping excursions of the cosmopolitan New Women of the 20th century. This is compared to the more sedate painting by William Glackens entitled The Shoppers (1907). Both paintings, though, capture wealthy women who have a new-found interest in shopping in the city, evidenced by the crowded figures in the paintings. The Journal of the American Medical Association, which used Shoe Shop as its March 24, 1999 cover, described Sparhawk-Jones as \\"witty, spirited, and talented\\". She received positive critical attention for her paintings, but Sparhawk-Jones did not enjoy and avoided promoting her work. Her painting Shop Girls was exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago as part of an intention to pick \\"eye-popping\\" or \\"little masterpieces of compactness and stimulation\\" from American artists' works of the late 19th century and early 20th-century. Now in the Art Institute's collection, Shop Girls was the first woman's painting bought by the Friends of American Art of the Art Institute. It was purchased in 1913 from Sparhawk-Jones for $550. Women's paintings were not generally as revered as paintings by men, which could fetch several thousands of dollars per painting at that time. The painting was made into a poster in the 1980s by the New York Department of Labor, which had the following quotation: Elizabeth Sparhawk-Jones, Shop Girls, 1912 Low point She hit a low point in her career when she suffered from mental illness and was admitted to an asylum in 1913. She exhibited work in the mid 1910s, for example at the 1916 exhibition at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts when she exhibited The Gardener. Artist colonies Main House, MacDowell Colony, Peterborough, New Hampshire She was one of the resident painters in the MacDowell Colony, run by Marian MacDowell in Peterborough, New Hampshire. Lilla Cabot Perry was another of the resident painters. The colony provided residence and a place for men and women to develop their literary, artistic, or musical talent. Sparhawk- Jones was identified as one of the \\"men and women who have gone on to enrich American life\\". Among the other named influential people were Puerto Rican Governor and poet Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, novelists Willa Cather and Thornton Wilder, and poet Edwin Arlington Robinson. According to Starhawk-Jones, she was there for a sum total of about ten years, and Robinson was there during each of her stays. In 1928, she was a resident at Yaddo, a 400-acre estate and artist community in Saratoga Springs, New York founded by Spencer and Katrina Trask. She continued to receive invitations to visit Yaddo for one- to two- month stays over the years, and her works were exhibited with those of Yaddo residents after her stays, such as in 1956 when two of her watercolor paintings incorporated in a Yaddo exhibit at Schenectady Museum while she was living in Europe. Other former Yaddo residents include Langston Hughes, Katherine Anne Porter, Truman Capote, and Sylvia Plath. Research Institute, now Maitland Art Center, Maitland, Florida For two or three years, she lived and worked in Florida at the Research Institute (now Maitland Art Center), which was run by Mary Louise Curtis Bok, later the wife of Efrem Zimbalist, and Andre Smith. Her works were exhibited at the Research Studio Gallery in late March and early April 1940. Later career She encouraged gallery and Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts shows of the works of self-taught Horace Pippin, of whom she said: \\"For me he is one of the few real artists in our century, when he is at his best.\\" In the 1940 book Pennsylvania; a Guide to the Keystone State, Sparhawk-Jones was identified as one of the state's \\"important young artists\\". William Alexander Newman Dorland also identified her as a talented woman painter, along with Cecilia Beaux and other American and English painters in his book The Sum of Feminine Achievement. She reestablished a successful career of modern works in the 1940s, during which she lived in Philadelphia. Sparhawk-Jones has particularly had a following in Chicago and Philadelphia. In 1940, she combined watercolor and oil in The Generations. Of her talent, realized in the painting, Marsden Hartley said, \\"It seems to be with something of a mental rapier that she conceives her subject matter for [her] pictures border on the exceptionally forceful and they are different in thought, as well as execution, from the work of most of the soft painters among men and women. She is a thinking painter with a rare sense of the drama of poetic and romantic incident.\\" She painted with watercolor in the 1940s, producing works such as The Dreamer which is in the permanent collection of the Delaware Art Museum. ::Curator Heather Campbell Coyle compared it to Michelangelo's The Dream (c.1533) and Francisco Goya's Capricho 43: The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters (1799). In Sparhawk-Jones' painting, the dreamer is a sleeping nude woman surrounded by images that seem to reflect her eerie nightmare. A skeleton lies against a stone in the foreground and above her nude women are carried by \\"winged creatures\\" into the darkness. Women are also carried away by men with wings, dressed in business suits. The painting has a composition similar to Michelangelo's painting, but Coyle states that, to her, the work is more similar to Goya's painting that also includes winged creatures above the sleeping subject of the painting. Sparhawk-Jones was called a phenomenon in 1944 in an American Artist magazine, in which the author questioned, \\"Strange, that she is not recognized far and wide as among the ablest, most distinguished women painters in the United States.\\" Sparhawk-Jones may not have attained greater fame, because at that time there was a \\"glass ceiling\\" for women artists that prevented them from attaining significant notoriety, according to biographer Townsend Ludington. Jerry Saltz of the Village Voice, for example, found that modern women painters, born 1879 to 1969, only accounted for 5% of the paintings in the Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection, which includes one of her paintings, Startled Woman. Barbara Lehmen Smith postulated about additional theories. For instance, it could also have been because she didn't promote her paintings, further complicated by her destruction of paintings when she was ill. Another theory is that she was not taken seriously because of her periods of mental illness. An exhibition of her watercolor paintings was held at PAFA in April 1948. Beginning in the mid-1950s and into the mid-1960s, she lived and enjoyed painting in Paris at the Saint Roman hotel near Tuileries Garden and the Louvre. Her work was featured in a story in the summer 1954 issue of the New Mexico Quarterly. Sparhawk-Jones was described as an emotional painter who created spiritual works of art in the 1960s. She was interviewed in 1964 for an oral history project by Ruth Gurin Bowman, curator of New York University's art collection, who gave the interview materials to the Archives of American Art. That year she won an award for her painting of a seascape at the Silvermine Guild of Artists show in New England. Papers about her career, including exhibition catalogs, sketches, artist's statements, and newspaper clippings are held at the Victor Building in the Smithsonian American Art Museum / National Portrait Gallery Library. In 2010, Elizabeth Sparhawk-Jones: The Artist Who Lived Twice, a biography of her life, was written and published by Barbara Leham Smith.

Younis initiates journeys in archives and narratives, and reinterprets collective experiences that have collapsed into personal ones. Through research, she builds collections of objects, images, information, narratives, and notes on why/how people tell their stories. Her practice is based on found material, and on creating materials when they cannot be found or when they do not exist. Early life and education Born in Kuwait in 1974, Younis moved to Amman in 1984. She graduated as an architect from the University of Jordan in 1997. She holds a Masters in Research in Visual Cultures from Goldsmiths, University of London. Career Younis has produced art installations, video works, publications, temporary collectives, publishing projects, and curated exhibitions. Her curatorial projects include Kuwait's first national pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 2013, the nomadic collection of Museum of Manufactured Response to Absence, and \\"An Index of Tensional and Unintentional Love of Land\\" at New Museum in the context of \\"Here and Elsewhere\\" exhibition organized in 2014. Her work was shown at the Institute du Monde Arabe (2013), 9th Gwangju Biennial (2012), Museum of Modern Arab Art in Doha (2012), New Museum Triennial (2012), 12th Istanbul Biennial (2011), Home Works '5 Beirut (2010), The Jerusalem Show (2009), PhotoCairo 4 (2008) and other places.

Curatorial projects In 2013, for Kuwait's first national pavilion at the 55th Venice Biennale, Ala Younis curated \\"National Works\\". The show disassembled symbols of grandeur in paused/post glorious times, in an attempt to re-interpret Kuwait's modernization project, while the exhibition's publication explored the emotional and theoretical contexts of works at a time when national identity was not questioned, and when modernist projects, cultural or contractual, were national works.Website of \\"Kuwait's Pavilion at La Biennale di Venezia, 2013\\" , Retrieved 20 March 2015. \\"\\"The sleeper hit of the summer among the pavilions from this part of the world is Kuwait's pavilion, nimbly curated by Ala Younis. It features a curious installation delving into the heart-stopping history of Sami Mohammad's statues, alongside a ruminative, achingly lonely series of photographs mounted on light boxes by the artist Tarek al-Ghoussein. Younis' sensitive excavation of Mohammad's work allows for some searching self criticality on nationalism and modernity from within the pavilion itself. Ghoussein's \\"K-Files\\" represent a seamless and gorgeous continuation of his staged self-portraiture series, working in a mode he calls performance photography.\\"Taking Venice for the world, by Kaelen Wilson-Goldie, The Daily Star on 11 June 2013, page 16 in printed version This show followed her curated \\"Museum of Manufactured Response to Absence (MoMRtA)\\" which premiered at Museum of Modern Art in Kuwait and Museum of Modern in 2012.

Yet once the old, elegant, curvaceous Nefertiti was retired, the market was flooded with aesthetically inferior Western machines. The Nefertiti became a focus for nostalgia, and this video explores people's attachment to their old sewing machines.\\" Her found objects become part of a web of stories in which the personal is inextricable from the collective, like in the publication version of \\"Tin Soldiers\\" (2010‚Äì2) which is made of text and image portraits of contemporary (in)formal Middle Eastern soldiers, and the virtual and alternative spaces they practice their version of militarism in. \\"Tin Soldiers\\" is also an installation of 12,265 metal figurines depicting nine armies of the Middle East. The project was produced and shown at HomeWorks 5 in Beirut (2010) and at the Istanbul Biennial (2011).Istanbul Biennial embraces Middle East, Hurriyet Daily News, Istanbul, 2011 The publication version was also installed as an exhibition at the New Museum TriennialQuiet Disobedience, by Holland Cotter, New York Times, 16 Feb 2012 and at the Gwangju Biennial, both took place in 2012. \\"UAR\\" (2014) is a series, of drawings and found objects, that studies the stories and mechanisms that produced Gamal Abdel Nasser's historical figure in the time of the United Arab Republic (1958‚Äì1971).

Her project \\"Plan for Greater Baghdad\\" was selected for \\"All the World's Futures\\" curated by Okwui Enwezor for the 56th International Art Exhibition ‚Äì La Biennale di Venezia, and show in Arsenale in 2015. Produced in two and three-dimensional prints, \\"Plan for Greater Baghdad\\" traces the stories and links around Saddam Hussein Gymnasium in Baghdad that was designed by Le Corbusier. Activated by a set of 35mm slides taken by architect Rifat Chadirji in 1982, the project reproduces documents that relate to monuments, architects, governments, and the shifts and tensions between ideals and ideologies. The project borrows its title from Frank Lloyd Wright's proposal for a cultural center and an Opera House in Baghdad. His \\"Plan for Greater Baghdad\\" was a result of his visit to Baghdad in 1957, yet it was never built.

The publication collects personal responses to questions that emerge around the place of consumer products in the lives of people and in society at large in Egypt. The people's answers illustrate how objects become iconic and acquire personas, and they tell some of the myths that surround them. The publication is named after Gamal Abdel Nasser's famous slogan of industrial promise. Her \\"Tin Soldiers\\" publication project, released in 2012, explores persistent realities of formal and informal fighters in the Middle East. The 280-page book collects stories that illustrate the fragility of individuals against militarism, notions of nationalism, and ideological agency.

The film also faced criticisms of plagiarism for its noticeable similarities with the 2013 Iranian short film Zan Va Shohar Karegar (The adventures of Married Couple) by Keywan Karimi. The story as well many shots have striking resemblance to Zan Va Shohar Karegar.Sengupta, however, claimed that in a private communication between Sengupta and Karimi, director of the short film, Karimi has said both are different films.

The film follows that young married couple as they go about their day, how they stay apart all day long except one brief moment when they get to be with each other. The entire movie has no dialogues.

It is a part of the Episcopal Diocese of Iowa, and is a contributing property in the Heritage Hill Historic District listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Old Zion Church After the opening of what is now eastern Iowa to American settlement in 1832, the town of Flint Hills was established the following year along the shores of the Mississippi River. The name \\"Shoquoquon\\", or Flint Hills, had been given to the area by the Sauk and Meskwaki tribes. Three years after the town was founded, the Right Rev. Jackson Kemper, Missionary Bishop of the Northwest, met an attorney named David Rorer, on the steamboat Olive Branch. Rorer was on his way to set up a practice in the young town and he convinced the bishop to establish a mission there. The town's name had been changed to Burlington in 1838 and the bishop established a mission of the Episcopal Church the same year. The Rev. John Bachelder from Rhode Island volunteered to serve the station and on March 15, 1839, he held the first service in Old Zion Church, Burlington's only religious building at that time. The mission was organized into a parish the following year. The Methodists continued to allow the Episcopalians to use Old Zion for their services in the parish's early years. The vestry acquired the property at Fifth and High Streets in 1849 and built a church. The same year it adopted the name Christ Church. As the congregation continued to grow the vestry looked to buy a different property to build a new church. After several years and some conflict over a new site, they decided to tear down the old church in 1884 and build a new one at the same location. The present church was completed the following year and consecrated by the Right Rev. William Stevens Perry, Bishop of Iowa, on May 16, 1886. The church was destroyed by a fire in 1973. The stone walls were all that were left standing. The Flemish carillon, pipe organ, and the church's records were all destroyed. Christ Church also lost its priceless collection of stained glass windows with the exception of the resurrection window that was located above the Altar. Sunday services were held at First Presbyterian Church while the church building was rebuilt using its original stone walls. Architecture Christ Church was designed by Burlington architect Charles A. Dunham in the Romanesque Revival style. It was constructed by a Mr. Phelps and the stonework was done by a Mr. Smith. The interior walls were decorated by Burlington artist W.H. Johnson, who was also responsible for decorating First Baptist Church. The east wall featured a large stained glass window from Chicago. The side windows were designed and made by the church's rector, the Rev. Dr. Johnson. The exterior of the church is composed of local limestone. It is laid in tandem courses of rubble masonry. The structure also features a unique round tower that terminates in a square belfry, and it is capped with a high pitched gabled roof. The parish house was built in 1901 and it reflected the church in its style and composition. With the exception of a dormer on the north side, the church building's exterior was completely restored after the 1973 fire. Prominent buttresses were added to the side walls to stabilize the weight of the roof. The congregation obtained impressive stained glass windows from an Anglican church in England from the Redundant Churches Program. The program encourages the adaptive use or preservation of unused church properties.

Vernantius Emeka Ndukaihe wrote in \\"Achievement as Value in the Igbo/African Identity: The Ethics,\\" section The 'Ofo' as a sacred symbol of worship: \\"The most important 'Ofo' is the lineage 'Ofo', believed to have been acquired by the founder of the 'Umunna' (family lineage group), as head. At the death of such a head, the next 'Okpara' (first male child) inherits it. So it goes, handed from generation to generation. There are also personal 'Ofo'. A young man acquires his first 'Ofo' when he is initiated into his first 'Ozo' (a sacred institution reserved for the honourable elders of the community) title. As one advances into the more senior 'Ozo', one acquires the corresponding 'Ofo'. Thus, to possess 'Ofo' is a symbol of great social, religious and moral achievement. The individual 'Ofo' of the 'Ozo' titled man can only be inherited by his eldest son after all the burial rites have been completed. It is regarded a calamity when a dead father has no son to inherit his 'Ofo'\\". The Igbo cultural and religious worldview is further explained with great detail in this book. In Nsukka cultural settings,\\"ofo\\" is called \\"ohoo\\" and is used as a symbol of identity by the Onyishi. It in turn acts as a symbol of worship too since an Onyishi being a village head hardly prays without an ofo/ohoo on his hand. Ohoo in Onyishi, is gotten from a tree known as ukwu ohoo.You can not use ohoo in Nsukka culture unless you are an Onyishi. Chinwe M. A. Nwoye wrote in \\"Igbo cultural and religious worldview: An insider‚Äôs perspective\\": \\"among the Igbo, the Obi (Obu) house which the first-born of a dead father takes over after the ceremony of Ikpocha Obi/Abam n‚ÄôObi, embodies the social principles of achievement and leadership as well as continuity as the survival ideology of Igbo life. [...] Ofo is the ritual symbol of authority among the Igbo (Ejizu, 1986). An Ofo is obtained from the twig of the ofo tree (Delarium Senegalese). This falls naturally away from the branches of the parent tree. These twigs represent the authority of a man to control his wives, and children. Thus according to Afigbo (1972:21) the Ofo was among the Igbo ‚Äúthe supreme ancestral symbol, the staff of traditional authority and influence as well as the symbol of justice, truth and right living. [...] Among the Igbo the eldest son of a man inherits the family Ofo on his death, through the ceremony of Abam n‚ÄôObi. The custody of the lineage or village community Ofo lies with the eldest male member of the lineage or village. [...] These observations show that its most important aspect is its symbolism of ancestral authority, especially when it is formerly handed on to Okpara (the first-born son) through the Abam n‚ÄôObi Ceremony.

The organisation was founded in Oslo, Norway in 1977 as the International Computer Archive of Modern English, before being renamed to its current title. The portal to their materials is hosted at the University of Bergen, where they have set out the aim of the organization to \\"collect and distribute information on English language material available for computer processing and on linguistic research to compile an archive of English text corpora in machine-readable form, and to make material available to research institutions.\\" Creating computer corpora, i.e. collections of texts in machine-readable form, is the most accessible way to study both transcribed spoken language and various genres of written texts for modern scholars, including both \\"descriptive and more theoretically-minded linguists\\". The ICAME group hosts academic conferences that focus on corpus linguistic studies of historical changes and contemporary grammatical descriptions of English, and makes corpora of different varieties of English available to scholars, starting with editions of the 1960s Brown Corpus. Their first academic conference was held in Bergen, Norway in 1979, and scholars who were interested in corpus linguistics continued to meet each spring in different European and English-speaking countries. At these meetings, the compilation and distribution of corpora they enabled played a key role in the creation of the field of corpus linguistics in the 20th century, a precursor to current big data analytics. In summarizing the field, Kennedy's Introduction to Corpus Linguistics notes that \\"for corpus linguists with an interest in the description of English, the International Computer Archive of Modern and Medieval English has been the major resource\\". The influence of ICAME on the field has also be laid out in Facchinetti's history, Corpus Linguistics Twenty-five Years On. One influential resource that ICAME made available was a CD of 20 different corpora, including those covering different regional Englishes (such as the Australian Corpus of English, the Wellington Corpus of Spoken New Zealand English, the Kolhapur Corpus of Indian English, the Bergen Corpus of London Teenage Language (COLT), the Helsinki Corpus of Older Scots, and the International Corpus of English‚ÄîEast-African component), as well as versions of the Brown Corpus and the Lancaster-Bergen-Oslo (LOB) corpus tagged for part of speech. ICAME also published an annual journal, the ICAME Journal, formerly ICAME News, that contains articles, conference reports, reviews and notices related to corpus linguistics. The current editors of the ICAME Journal are Merja Kyt√∂ and Anna-Brita Stenstr√∂m.

Fragmentary remains of Oswestry Castle The first reference to the castle in Oswestry was in 1086, when castelle Lurve (or castle L‚Äôoeuvre) is recorded in the Domesday Book as being built by Rainald, Sheriff of Shropshire in the Hundred of Meresberie. No town was recorded until around 1272 when references appear to the settlement of Blancminster (named after its white stone church). The Welsh were already referring to Croes Oswallt (Cross of Oswald) in 1254, regarding St Oswald, the Northumbrian king killed at the Battle of Maserfield (reputed to have taken place near Oswestry) in 641 AD. After Rainald the castle passed to Alan fitz Flaad. The civil war between Stephen and Matilda (1135‚Äì54) saw the Marcher Lord of Oswestry, William FitzAlan, join forces with Matilda. As a consequence he was deprived of his lands, including the castle and its area, and titles by Stephen after 1138, when he fled into exile. The castle was reclaimed by Madog ap Maredudd the Prince of Powys between 1149 and 1154, along with the lordship of the area. This was short-lived; on the accession of Henry II in 1154, William FitzAlan recovered his estates and was restored as High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1155 until his death in 1160. A period of conflict between the Welsh and the English followed and the castle was sacked numerous times. In 1165, Henry himself adopted it as a base for his unsuccessful campaign against Owain Gwynedd. In 1211 King John moved against Llywelyn the Great and the castle came under attack. By 1270 the castle‚Äôs walls had been extended to embrace the town, but its military significance declined. The castle was the scene of a parliament held by Richard II in 1398. It was garrisoned by Royalist troops during the Civil War, and captured by the forces of Oliver Cromwell in 1644. It had been largely demolished by the Roundheads by 1650. The motte is about 12m high and 52m by 72m at its base. The collapsed remnants of the stone keep, possibly dating to the 13th century, are in situ. The remains of the keep are a Grade II Listed Building. The internal layout of the keep is not known, but an inventory compiled in 1398 notes three chambers, hall, chapel dedicated to St Nicholas, kitchen, larder and buttery. To the south east of the keep are the remains of a bastion, largely rebuilt in the late 19th century, it is a Grade II Listed Building. The walls and the gate piers are also Grade II Listed. The castle bailey, which lies to the south of the motte, probably served as the initial focus for the development of the town. The town had grown beyond the limits of the bailey before the second half of the 13th century when the town walls were constructed. The location of the bailey is recorded in the street names Bailey Street and Bailey Head.

Composed in January 1914, it is the only work he published for violin-piano duet.In March 1917 Satie planned to write a violin-piano piece, L'embarquement pour Cyth√®re, for violinist H√©l√®ne Jourdan- Morhange, but abandoned it after some sketches. These were completed by Robert Orledge and published in 1995 (Salabert). See http://data.bnf.fr/14793709/erik_satie_embarquement_pour_cythere/ A typical performance lasts about 5 minutes. Description One of Satie's infrequent excursions into chamber music, the Choses vues is contemporaneous with the bulk of his humoristic piano suites (1913-1914) and was conceived in a similar spirit.Robert Orledge observed that the concluding Fantaisie musculaire acquired its title and \\"mock-virtuosic concept\\" before Satie wrote a note of its final version. See Robert Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 100. It has been interpreted as a spoof of academic musical training, in particular that of the Schola Cantorum in Paris,Jane F. Fulcher, \\"French Cultural Politics and Music: From the Dreyfus Affair to the First World War\\", Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 203. where the composer had recently ended his studies (at age 46) with Vincent d'Indy. The suite's three brief pieces are satirical reinventions of Baroque musical forms, enhanced by Satie's characteristic droll titles and performance directions. 1\\\\. Choral hypocrite (Hypocritical Chorale) - G Major - Grave Satie had a singular attitude towards the chorale, that \\"symbol of Protestant piety and music pedagogy\\"Mary E. Davis, \\"Erik Satie\\", Reaktion Books, 2007, p. 98. much employed by Bach. In his own compositions he associated it with boredom and conformity.Satie made this attitude explicit in his prefatory Unappetizing Chorale to Sports et divertissements (1914), which he claimed contained \\"everything I know about boredom\\" and dedicated to \\"those who do not like me.\\" See Rollo H. Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", Dover Publications, Inc., NY, 1968, p. 87. Originally published in 1948 by Denis Dobson Ltd., London. The 10-bar Choral hypocrite, played on muted strings, is built of stark self-contained phrases and hardly resembles the sort of singable \\"tune\\" one would expect from the genre. An almost painful dissonance at the halfway point (bars 5-6) is marked in the score \\"with the hand on the conscience.\\" As a postscript Satie added a statement designed to annoy his critics: \\"My chorales equal those of Bach, with this difference: there are not so many of them, and they are less pretentious.\\"All of Satie's extramusical texts quoted in this article are English translations from the original 1916 score available at http://imslp.org/wiki/Choses_vues_%C3%A0_droite_et_%C3%A0_gauche_(Satie,_Erik). See also Rollo H. Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 93. 2\\\\. Fugue √† t√¢tons (Groping Fugue) - C Major - Pas vite A repetitive, childlike theme provides the subject for a loosely woven fugue, initiated by the piano \\"with silly but convenient na√Øvet√©.\\" It wanders off on tangents that Satie's annotations suggest should evoke \\"tenderness and fatality\\" and \\"dry and distant bones.\\" The score urges both players to tackle the theme's grandiloquent final restatement \\"with a big head.\\" 3\\\\. Fantaisie musculaire (Muscular Fantasy) - C Major - Un peu vif This playfully ironic showpiece burlesques violin virtuosity but nevertheless requires considerable skill from the performer.William Thomas Walker, review of Gidon Kremer recital performance of the Choses vues at Page Auditorium, Duke University, Durham NC, February 28, 2003 http://cvnc.org/reviews/2003/february/KremerCole.html It presents often dissonant send-ups of string techniques (harmonics, pizzicato, trill, glissando), culminating with a cadenza, which the player is advised to launch into \\"with enthusiasm\\" and end \\"very sheepishly and coldly.\\" The suite fades out on an anticlimactic pianissimo. Title page of the first edition (1916) of Choses vues √† droite et √† gauche (sans lunettes) Humor aside, Satie was painstaking in his efforts to redevelop these old musical forms in modern terms, harmonically and structurally. He rejected the first movement he completed, an untitled 31-bar chorale in G Major, and experimented with several fugue subjects (including a quotation of the folksong Au clair de la lune) for the Fugue √† t√¢tons.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 96.Satie would quote Au clair de la lune in his next work, Sports et divertissements (in the piece Le Flirt). See Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 202. In his analysis of Satie's composing methods Robert Orledge remarked on \\"how ordinary his first thoughts often were\\",Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 77. and this certainly applies to the Choses vues. Satie's original order for the pieces - Fantaisie, Choral, Fugue Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 302. \\\\- would have given the suite a conventional fast-slow-fast pattern, with the cadenza appearing in the first movement in the manner of a traditional concerto, and the coda of the Fugue providing a conclusive-sounding finish. In the end Satie chose to scramble this clich√©d sequence, and by positioning the Fantaisie as the finale saved most of the suite's musical jokes for last. Performance of the Choses vues - along with the rest of Satie's 1914 compositions - was delayed by the start of World War I in July. Satie dedicated it to violinist Marcel Chailley (1881-1936), who with pianist Ricardo Vi√±es gave the premiere at the Ecole Lucien de Flagny in Paris on April 2, 1916.

It is notable as the southern end of both State Highway 1 and the Te Araroa Trail; both these facilities span the length of the country. Stirling Point hosts a signpost with multiple directional signs; it is one of the most photographed items in Southland. Stirling Point has an anchor chain sculpture which replicates the sculpture on Stewart Island. Captain William Stirling The site is named for Captain Stirling (1812‚Äì1851) who operated a whaling station for Johnny Jones in this location from 1836 to 1844 when he took on the site's ownership. Stirling, whose real name is believed to be Pankhurst or Pankhirst, was born in Broadstairs, England and ran away to become a seafarer when he was aged 14. Stirling Point signpost The Stirling Point signpost was first erected in 1960. The original wooden signpost had six destination blades including Dog Island, Ruapuke Island, Wellington, London and the South Pole. After repeated vandalism, a metal post was cemented into place and twelve destination blades were fitted. Administratively, Bluff is part of Invercargill City and the signpost includes sister cities of Invercargill. The sister-city relationship with Hobart broke down in the late 1990s. The relationship with Kumagaya in Japan was formalised in 1993 and with Suqian in China in 2013. When a Scottish tourist pointed out in 2017 that directions, distances and the coordinates displayed by the signpost were wrong, officials reviewed the setup and confirmed the errors. As part of the corrections implemented in late 2018, Tokyo in Japan was removed from the signpost and replaced with Suqian, but the former sister city Hobart was kept on the sign.

The devastating category four hurricane damaged or destroyed many historical coastal-Carolina buildings and left much of Charleston's iron, plaster and fine wood work in disrepair. It took ten years to rebuild and restore the city's damaged homes and historical buildings, in part, because of a shortage of skilled artisans. In 1999, in response to this gap in the building arts, a group of local movers and shakers planted the seeds that led to the founding of ACBA. Initially, classes and workshops that focused on the building arts were offered at a number of different Charleston area locations. However, the original educational model proved difficult to execute, and the college founders regrouped to establish a degree-granting college, integrating the American liberal arts degree model with the artisan teaching styles of Europe. In 2004, ACBA was licensed by the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education to recruit students for a Bachelor of Applied Science and an Associate of Applied Science in the building arts. In 2009 the college awarded its first degrees to seven students. During these same years, ACBA reconfigured its administration, hiring current president, Lt.(ret.) General Colby M. Broadwater III and other administrative team members with strong business experience.  Academics  Student at the American College of the Building Arts working with steel.American College of the Building Arts combines a traditional liberal arts education with programs in trade education that are based on European and other models. The framing and plaster programs are based on the French ‚Äúles Compagnons du Devoir,‚Äù a trade guild offering high-skill vocational and educational training rich in culture and humanity. The stone program is based on programs at Lincoln Cathedral and Wells Cathedral in the United Kingdom. The iron program has a long association with Colonial Williamsburg and also with the work of Philip Simmons, famed Charleston ironwork artisan and one of the founders of ACBA. Pieces designed and made by Simmons are displayed at the Smithsonian Institution, South Carolina State Museum and outside the United States in France and China. In addition to trade-specific classes, students pursue a course of general studies that includes not only typical college courses, such as English and mathematics, but also specialized courses in drawing, design, materials science and construction management. ACBA maintains a low student-to-faculty ratio to ensure the highest standards of quality in its programs.http://issuu.com/buildingartscollege/docs/acba.2013-2014.catalog.fincat.08141American College of the Building Arts freshman math class.

Carpentry and forged architectural iron programs were housed at a separate site. The Jail was originally constructed in 1802 and expanded in 1855 to include living quarters for the warden and jailers on the street side and an octagonal rear wing. Many infamous inmates were housed in the prison, including high seas pirates, the female mass murderer Lavinia Fischer and Denmark Vesey, a free African American who plotted a slave rebellion that was discovered before it could be executed. During the Civil War both Confederate and Union prisoners were incarcerated within its walls. Although it had no electricity or running water, the jail housed prisoners until it was decommissioned in 1939.http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/charleston/old.htmAmerican College of the Building Arts ground breaking of the Old Charleston Trolley Barn on May 7, 2015. During the years spent occupying and renovating the jail, the college viewed itself as caretaker of the building and its rich history. As part of ACBA's living learning laboratory, faculty members led students in assessing needs and proper methods of restoration, preservation and reconstruction.http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/2009/september- october/hands-on-education.html Having outgrown its existing facilities, ACBA launched a major fundraising effort in 2014 to establish a single, expanded campus that could consolidate the teaching of all trades under one roof. With a major donation from Parallel Capital and from Russell and Betty Joan Hitt, founders of Virginia-based HITT Contracting, early supporters of ACBA, the college raised funds to purchase and renovate the abandoned Charleston Trolley Barn on Upper Meeting Street. On May 7, 2015, 150 people attended the ground breaking ceremony. It took just over one year and approximately $6 million to build the new state-of-the-art ACBA campus that was formally opened in October 2016. The newly repurposed building maintains the historical ethos of the original structure while providing the students with modern academic and workshop space. Approximately 39,000 square feet were carved out of the barn's original 24,000 square foot footprint. The front third of the three-story building houses an exhibition lobby, administrative offices, classrooms, labs and a community room available to local civic groups. Workshops and trade classrooms are located in the back two-thirds of the building. A student lounge, faculty offices and conference spaces occupy the second floor. The third floor rafters house the computer lab and ACBA's unique library and its special collections. The building has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In September 2018, the College received national accreditation from the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges. Additional Programs A diverse lineup of evening courses was introduced to the public beginning in the fall of 2017, including AutoCAD, interior design and history of Charleston architecture. In January 2018, ACBA initiated intensive one-week courses in areas such as sculptural blacksmithing, decorative woodcarving, furniture restoration, furniture design and stained glass. In the fall of 2018, the addition of an undergraduate major in classical architecture and design will bring the list of ACBA majors up to seven.

For anti-torpedo boat defense, they carried four 45-caliber QF Canon de Mod√®le 1891 guns on the forecastle deck, as well as ten QF and four QF Hotchkiss guns.

In 1918, she was part of the Atlantic Naval Division, under Commander Paqu√©, and tasked with escort duty. On 7 August 1918, escorting a 24-ship convoy inbound from New York, she was torpedoed by the submarine , off Brest. At nightfall, at 20:51, a torpedo hit the port side underneath the forward bridge, followed ten seconds after by another under the aft bridge. The explosions killed three men, and neither the submarine nor her periscope were spotted, although a Lieutenant detected the first torpedo shortly before it hit. Assessment of the ship soon revealed extensive damage, but as the list was moderate, the officers deemed that although the ship was lost, she would not sink rapidly. They moved the ship off the route of the convoy, radioed a distress call, and stopped the engines to allow the crew to evacuate. The list then started to increase while the crew abandoned ship. Fifty minutes after the torpedo hit, Dupetit-Thouars rolled over and sank, killing ten sailors still aboard trying to launch the last raft. Following the sinking, U-62 surfaced to inquire as to the name and tonnage of the cruiser, and collect a ribbon from a sailor's hat.

Johnson describes her as a \\"modern\\" if not \\"modernist\\" writer. Early years She was born in 1867 in Almeria to a middle-class family, in which her father owned a gold mine. Her father Jos√© de Burgos Ca√±izares and her uncle Ferdinand were in charge of the vice-consulate of Portugal in Almeria. Her mother, Nicosia Segui Nieto, had come to the marriage with a substantial inheritance.Carmen der Burgos \\"La Columbine\\" , turismodealmeria.org. Retrieved March 29, 2015. Career She escaped her family when she met Arturo Asterz Bustos. He was fifteen years older than her; he was a poet, writer, and an alcoholic. Her new husband earned money as a typesetter on the family's newspaper, but she quickly discovered that this was to be her work. She and Arturo were unhappily married for 17 years, having four children - of whom only one survived. In 1898 her infant son died and she enrolled at the local college to obtain a teaching certificate. She quickly advanced, and within a year she was qualified to teach primary. By the end of 1898, she was qualified to teach secondary school and by 1900 she was qualified to teach teachers. Armed with her new achievements, she could anticipate employment for life. She and her remaining daughter left her abusive and unfaithful husband and they set up their own house in Guadalajara where her first book was written. During this time she had learnt how to write for a living, she had earned her independence and she had developed a contempt for the institution of marriage. Burgos regarded herself as a feminist but her gender meant that her writings were not included when evaluations were made of Spanish (male) modernism. However Burgos was nominally creating a number of novels for the \\"weekly novel\\" market that was popular at the start of the twentieth century. Burgos's novels however dealt with legal and political themes. Her novels dealt with taboo subjects including male and female homosexuality and transvestism. She highlighted the dual values applied that blamed women who were adulterers whereas men's involvement was forgiven. Women were given responsibility for illegitimate children and the law overlooked the abuse that some women found within their marriages. It has been noted that Burgos raised controversial subjects concerning gender, the law and rights but her writing did not offer a solution. She exposed to the readers the disparity between traditional values of female education and modern life. Burgos however exposed difficult issues as a dramatic event and in 1904 she had led a campaign to improve the availability of divorce. Recognition In 1906, Burgos became the first professional journalist in Spain in the capacity as editor of Madrid's Diario Universal. She served as the first president of the International League of Iberian and Latin American Women (Liga Internacional de Mujeres Ib√©ricas e Hispanoamericanas). During the dictatorship of General Franco Burgos was written out of the history books in Spain. Following the restoration of democracy she was again recognised and replaced into the history of women's rights in Spain.

United States: An East Gate Book, 1998.Print. She was known for her shingeki plays, but had written some classical puppet bunraku and kabuki dramas, and later became a scriptwriter for both radio and television shows.Goodman, David G. \\"The Quest for Salvation in Japan‚Äôs Modern History: Four Plays by Akimoto Matsuyo.\\" Modern Japanese Theatre and Performance. Eds. David Jortner, Keiko McDonald, and Kevin J. Wetmore Jr. United States: Lexington Books, 2006. Web. Along with Akimoto's childhood, World War II played a significant role in her career. As a realist playwright, she used her work to make political statements in order to warn the greater Japanese community that the government was trying to continue their pre-war imperial system which was fulfilled with capitalism, militarism, and patriarchy.  Childhood  Akimoto was born in Yokohama on January 2, 1911, to a family of six consisting of her mother, father, and four older brothers; one of them being Fujio Akimoto, who was a haiku poet.Japan Playwrights Association, ed. Half a Century of Japanese Theatre. Vol 7. Japan: Kinokuniya Company Ltd. 2005.Print. Earlier in her life at the age of 3 her father died. In addition, to her father's death at a young age she was diagnosed with pleurisy when she was in the third grade. Due to Akimoto's fatigue from her illness and her family's belief in traditional gender roles, the family did not see the need for Akimoto to extend her education, so she attended public school for the minimum required years. For many years of her childhood, Akimoto was home schooled with the help of her two older brothers. It was her brothers‚Äô novels, which were accessible to her in the house as a child, that sparked her fascination with drama. She became a voracious reader as child and acquired theatrical language from reading Japanese classics that later helped develop her career as a playwright. She gained inspiration to be a part of the literary field from reading western Greek tragedies, Ibsen‚Äôs modern plays, Japanese noh plays, and Chikamatsu Monzaemon's j≈çruri during her childhood.  Career  In 1945 at the age of 34 she became a student at the Drama Workshop Gikyoku Kenky≈´ (The Society of Drama Study) which was founded by leftist playwright Miyoshi J≈´r≈ç (1902-1958), a leading playwright of the time.Meyer-Dinkgr√§fe, Daniel, ed. Who‚Äôs Who in Contemporary World Theatre. United States and Canada: Routledge, 2000. Web. Not only did Miyoshi encourage Akimoto to write professionally, but he also inspired her. While, Akimoto disregarded comments that pertained to her as a disciple of Miyoshi, she was nevertheless influenced by his works of humanism, communism, and nationalism. In 1947 she debuted A Sprinkling of Dust with Miyoshi‚Äôs expertise. At the age of 35 and end of WWII, she became a professional playwright. She wrote for major shingeki companies, and even got to run her own company Theatre Troupe Engekza from 1967-1970. Akimoto wrote her plays in a realist style with a focus on interpersonal family relationships.Rimer, J. Thomas, Mitsuya Mori, and M. Cody Poulton, eds. The Columbia Anthology of Modern Japanese Drama. Chichester, NY: Columbia University Press, 2014. Print. \\"I want to use dialect in such a way that when hearing the dialogue, any person from the above areas will feel that is the language of their area‚Ä¶I feel that is a form of dialogue that people from Tokyo and other areas far away can understand and relate to\\" - AkimotoJapan Playwrights Association, ed. Half a Century of Japanese Theatre. Vol 7. Japan: Kinokuniya Company Ltd. 2005. 252- 257. Print. However, in her later plays she strayed from her realists approach and switched to a shamaness style that incorporated dark poetry in order to capture her vision on how she saw the Japanese community of her time. This can be seen in her award-winning masterpiece Kaison of Priest of Hitachi (1967 translated 1988) where the dialogue was used to present Japan's postwar culture.Akihiko, Senda. \\"Double Suicide, after Chikamatsu A T≈çh≈ç production.\\" The Voyage of Contemporary Japanese Theatre. Trans. J. Thomas Rimer. Honolulu, HI: University of Hawai'i Press, 1997. 104-108. Web. Her interest in human suffering and her compassion for those who suffer no doubt reflected her own experience as a child. A recurring theme in many of Akimoto's work is the human quest for redemption. This theme can happen in several of ways: redemption from feeling guilty or ashamed, from affliction of physical or emotional suffering, from exploitation, or from death.Goodman, David G. \\"The Quest for Salvation in Japan‚Äôs Modern History: Four Plays by Akimoto Matsuyo.\\" Modern Japanese Theatre and Performance. Eds. David Jortner, Keiko McDonald, and Kevin J. Wetmore Jr. United States: Lexington Books, 2006. 51-63. Web. Redemption is a consistent theme in all of Akimoto's works that in any play you will find that the main character is searching for some way to release themselves and others from what is holding them back from their quest. Many of Akimoto's main characters encounter either a social, political, or religious entity to guide them in their quest for redemption, but one of these systems obstructs them from doing so. By shining light on Japan's government through these types of references in her plays Akimoto was able to warn the Japanese community that the government does not want them to find redemption, but wanted their support in their pre-war empire efforts.  Major works  The following year after Akimoto enrolled into Miyoshi's Drama Workshop Gikyoku Kenky≈´ she published her first play Keijin (The Light Dust) in the journal Gekisaku in 1946. 1949 was when her second play, Mourning Clothes (Reifuku), was published, and when her career started to take off working with important directors such as Koreya Senda and Yukio Ninagawa who staged her plays. There was a time in her career where she felt under appreciated as a playwright. So she stopped writing plays for a while and chose to become a scriptwriter for radio and television shows instead, but did not make what she hoped to get out of it. Regardless, her play Kaision of Priest of Hitachi won over Hanada Kiyoteru, a well-known critic in 1967 at the Engeki Theatre and since then her plays have been performed. In Akimoto's work death reoccurs and the various Japanese customs developed to conquer it. Topics included mourning which can be found in (Mourning Clothes, 1949), immortality in (The Life of Muraoka Iheji, 1960), and shink≈ç sh≈´ky≈ç, or \\"new religions\\" in (Thoughts on our Lady of Scabs, 1968). Her 1964 work, Kaison the Priest of Hitachi, deals with a group of boys whose parents die in the 1945 firebombing of Tokyo, this play is considered to be a landmark in Japanese drama. Despite her serious and often tragic topics, one of Akimoto's strengths lies in injecting comic elements into her plays. Her collected works were published in five volumes in 2002, a year after her death. Namesake awards  In 1964 Akimoto received the Toshiko Tamura Award Gay Art Festival Award for her play Hitachi Boumimikoto. In 1969 she received the Mainichi Art Award. Then in 1975 she won the Yomiuri Literary Award for her play Nana-nin Misaki This play was popular all across Japan that it was also awarded the Purple Ribbon the following years in 1979. In 2001, the year of Akimoto's death, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper established the Asahi Awards for the Theater Arts (Asahi Butai Geijutsu Sh≈ç). The annual Asahi Awards consist of five prizes, one of which is named after Akimoto Matsuyo and is awarded for \\"theatrical works, individuals, or organizations that have succeeded in combining popular entertainment with artistic merit.\\" References  Category:1911 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Japanese dramatists and playwrights Category:Winners of the Yomiuri Prize Category:20th-century Japanese dramatists and playwrights Category:20th- century Japanese women writers ","title":"Akimoto Matsuyo"},{"id":"46255385","text":"FC Prykarpattia-2 Ivano-Frankivsk is a Ukrainian football team based in Ivano- Frankivsk, Ukraine.

They are a cooked sausage that are scalded (parboiled), as opposed to being raw. They are typically prepared from raw meat that is finely-chopped, are sometimes smoked, and are typically served hot. In the English-speaking world such sausages are usually divided into two classes: cooked sausages (e.g. hot dogs) and cooked smoked sausages (e.g. kielbasa). Characteristics and processing The consistency of a scalded sausage depends on the water binding capacity of the meat. This is particularly high immediately after slaughter, so that sausages were traditionally made from \\"still warm, freshly slaughtered\\" meat. In contemporary times, sausages are mainly produced using chilled or matured meat. In addition, fat stabilization and structure formation (gelation) are crucial factors in cooked sausage. Types casing According to German guidelines, parboiled sausages are divided for meat and meat products, broadly divided into four groups: * Cooked sausages (frankfurters, Debrecener) * Boiled sausage, minced (Lyon, Weisswurst (white sausage), meatloaf, Burenwurst) * Coarse cooked sausage (smoked sausage, Krainer sausage, beer sausage, Krakauer) * Cooked sausage with inserts (K√§sekrainer, ham sausage). Additional types of br√ºhwurst include Bierschinken, Knackwurst and Bierwurst.

Additionally, the tape is hosted by DJ Holiday. The tape was largely a solo effort, only featuring guest vocals on two of its tracks, from Andy Milonakis and Glo Gang labelmate, Benji Glo.

Composition On the album, David Drake of Complex, stated, \\"even over typical production Keef is more than a rapper,\\" claiming, \\"he's a pop songwriter at heart,\\" and adding, \\"records like \\"W.W.Y.D.\\" and \\"Yours\\" show his facility for choruses and melody, while \\"That's What\\" exemplifies his continued strength as a creator of hooky, ingratiating rhythmic patterns in the vein of \\"Love Sosa.\\" On \\"Get Money,\\" his use of ad-libs to call-and-response his own lead melody in the chorus shows considerably more compositional forethought than most performers today.\\" Included throughout the tape are audio samples of interviews featuring Keef, which Drake states, \\"sells the rapper as a more sympathetic figure than he's ever been in the public sphere,\\" later adding, \\"though undeniably charming, they do serve as something of a bluffer's guide for empathizing with a guy painted as a monster by the press.\\" Production The production of the album was done in-house, with Keef self-producing one track. Drake noted, \\"by and large, the beats slot in well with Atlanta trap production of the last several years, a statement of intent that Keef perhaps isn't as concerned with being a weird rap outsider as much as he is an original voice within a familiar milieu.\\" Keef's self-produced track was praised with Elliot Pearson of The Alibi commenting, \\"if \\"What Up\\" is any indication, he‚Äôs made serious progress as a beat-maker.\\" Jayson Greene of Pitchfork Media noted, \\"congas and bongos, clattering busily around the edges of the music, are the most noticeable new addition on Sorry 4 the Weight.\\" On Keef's production of \\"What Up\\", Greene writes, \\"He‚Äôs a formal innovator, one who finds lots of ways for his muttering vocals to mesh with the contrary moving lines of his music. His cadences have strange emphases everywhere, and the effect is similar to hearing someone clumping around a floor above you wearing a full leg cast.\\" Ps : this is fire Reception The mixtape received generally positive critical reception. Pearson noted, \\"This tape is hard as hell and by no means an easy listen, but paranoia, violence and tenderness sometimes come together in the delivery of a line like 'They don‚Äôt want me to feed my baby now,' and the effect is felt in the heart.\\" Awarding the tape 3 out of 5 stars, David Drake of Complex writes, \\"Sorry 4 the Weight finds the rapper in a more focused, writerly mode, when compared with the lunging blunt-force-trauma raps of Back From the Dead 2. Likewise a substantial step away from the pretty, melodic Nobody, Keef is not treading the same old ground.\\" Jayson Greene of Pitchfork Media awarded the tape a 7.1 out of 10 rating, stating, \\"The loneliness and poetry of \\"Nobody\\", say, in which Keef‚Äôs wandering, bluesy vocal take may as well be a wah-wah guitar solo for all you can make out of it, is missing.

He was the Communist Party First Secretary and top leader of Shanxi province until he was overthrown by the rebel Red Guards at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. He was tortured and committed suicide in January 1967. Early life Wei Heng was born in 1915 to a poor peasant family in Shapochi village () in Lingchuan County, Shanxi province. His father Wang Changju () was a manual labourer who struggled to make ends meet, and Wei Heng was adopted by a relative surnamed Wei in a neighbouring village. Wei attended primary and secondary school and then became a primary school teacher. However, his adoptive father began to gamble and smoke opium, and the Wei family fortunes began to gradually decline. Career After the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, Wei Heng joined the Communist Red Army in January 1938. He served as a guerrilla fighter and later political operative in his native Shanxi. He joined the Communist Party of China in October 1938, and was selected as a delegate to the 7th National Congress of the Communist Party held in Yan'an in 1945. He took part in the Yan'an Rectification Movement. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Wei served in a series of leadership posts in locales in Shanxi province, including a stint as Party Secretary of Yuncheng. In April 1952, Wei Heng began working as part of the Communist Party's Shanxi Provincial Committee as head of its Organization Department, and then the provincial Secretary for Commission for Discipline Inspection. He became the provincial governor, and by June 1965 began serving as First Secretary (i.e. top leader) of the province. Downfall and death Beginning with the 1967 January Storm at the early stage of the Cultural Revolution, the radical Red Guards started an intense wave of power seizures all over China, with the encouragement of the Central Cultural Revolution Group. The radicals toppled provincial governments and established revolutionary committees. In Shanxi, Wei Heng was outmaneuvered by his deputy Liu Geping, a Muslim who had the personal support of Mao Zedong and especially Kang Sheng, as well as top leaders of the Shanxi Military District. Liu became the leader of the Shanxi General Command of Revolutionary Rebels, and seized power of the Shanxi provincial government on January 12. Wei Heng was detained by the Red Guards and held in solitary confinement on January 15. He was tortured by the rebels and committed suicide on January 29. He was the third provincial-level chief to choose suicide as an escape from torture, after Wan Xiaotang of Tianjin and Yan Hongyan of Yunnan. On January 25, the People's Daily published an editorial celebrating the power seizure in Shanxi, and the national government certified the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee on March 28. Rehabilitation After the end of the Cultural Revolution, provincial party authorities posthumously rehabilitated Wei in January 1979. In June 1985, the party \\"completely vindicated\\" Wei Heng and denounced his persecution.

Structure  The current buildings of the temple were built in 1627, as witnessed by a patio slab where it is written in Chinese: \\"Built in the seventh month of the seventh year of the reign of Emperor Tian Qi\\". The temple is located in Coronel Mesquita Avenue, in the Parish of Our Lady of Fatima, close to Mong Ha and Temples of Kun Iam Tchai and Seng Wong. The temple has a large entrance gate and roofs decorated with porcelain figures. Inside the temple, there are 3 main pavilions. These pavilions are dedicated, respectively, to the Precious Buddhas, the Buddha of Longevity and Kun Iam. In the third pavilion, statue of Kun Iam is dressed in embroidered silk and decorated with a crown. To the rear, are terraced gardens, and one of them contains a commemorative arch. There are calligraphy scrolls and Chinese painting inside the temple of famous authors such as, Qu Dajun. During World War II, the Chinese painter Gao Jianfu lived and taught in the temple. It was precisely at a stone table located in the gardens of the temple which was signed the first Sino-American Treaty on July 3, 1844 by the Viceroy of Liangguang Keying and the US Minister Plenipotentiary Caleb Cushing. This treaty is known as the \\"Sino-American Treaty of Mong Ha\\". Near the table, there are 4 older trees with intertwined branches, best known for \\"tree lovers\\" and that symbolise marital fidelity. Elsewhere in the garden there are a small pavilion that contains a marble statue of a monk, several sources in the form of miniature Chinese landscapes, groves of bamboo and small shrines to deceased monks.http://www.macauholiday.com/kun-iam- temple.html The birthday of Kun Iam is celebrated on the 19th day of the second, sixth, ninth and eleventh lunar months.http://www.temple.mo/?mod=festival&id;=60‚ü®=en thumb  See also   References  Category:Buddhist temples in Macau Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1627 Category:1627 establishments in China Category:1627 establishments in the Portuguese Empire Category:17th-century establishments in Macau ","title":"Kun Iam Temple"},{"id":"46255545","text":"St. Luke's Episcopal Church, formerly known as Hope Episcopal Church, is an historic church building located in Fort Madison, Iowa, United States.

History The congregation was founded in 1847 as Hope Episcopal Church. They built the brick, Gothic Revival-style church on a stone foundation in 1857. Burlington architect Charles A. Dunham designed the renovation of the church in 1886, and electric lights were added two years later. A rectory to house the parish priest was built from 1889 to 1890. It was torn down sometime around 1958. The choir room in the church was enlarged and opened to the sanctuary in 1896. In 1905 the congregation changed its name to St. Luke's. The sanctuary floor was lowered and other remodeling projects were completed in 1925. The parish house was added to the rear of the church from 1928 to 1929. It was designed by Fort Madison architect Robin Carswell and constructed by Alhen Brothers contractors. Another extensive remodeling of the church occurred in the late 1940s or early 1950s. The church office addition was constructed in 1966.

In 1953, it moved to its current location on Ventura Boulevard. Learning the craft from his brother-in-law, Carl Becker Sr., Paul Toenniges worked in William Lewis & Son in Chicago, and later under Rudolf Wurlitzer, finally opening his first studio in Los Angeles. Crafting up to five instruments a year, they sell for approximately 30-42 thousand dollars. Nancy, one of founder Paul Toenniges' daughters, together with her husband, Hans Benning, took over the studio in 1978 after Paul's retirement. Nancy and Hans studied violin making at the Violinmaking School in Mittenwald. Luthier Eric Benning, Nancy and Hans' son who trained with celebrated maker Carl Fredrick Becker, currently runs the business, while his son Nathan also performs as a luthier. Notable musicians who bought Benning instruments include Paul Coletti, Sid Weiss, Victor Gaskin (used while recording Duke Ellington's 70th Birthday Concert) and Arnold Jacobs, while Hans Benning restored and maintained several of Jascha Heifetz's instruments during the latter part of his life. Benning Violins also maintained some of Nathaniel Ayers' violins. The Benning family has donated numerous instruments and taught students in Vicente Guerrero, Baja California. One of their students, Tito Quiroz, founded a music school in Ensenada named the Benning Academia de Musica. The Bennings have visited the academy in Ensenada about once a fortnight since 1978.

During WWII, Paul resorted to American curly birch, given European wood became unavailable. In 1946, he moved to LA together with his wife, and started working at the Wurlitzer Violin Collection, making instruments at home during his own time. Realising he wanted to dedicate to the restoration and sale of fine instruments, he set up shop in 1953.

Early years and education Born in Ramsgate, Kent, in 1876, her parents were Josiah Austin, a Cornish naval surgeon, and Fanny (n√©e Mann) Austin. She was educated privately by a Mrs. Louise Jopling-Rowe and Mr. Cuthbert E. Swan. Career Hyena Dholes pack Jackals Austen's favorite subjects were wild animals, and she was successful in the illustration of books. Her etchings of animals and birds were popular in the 1940s and 1950s. At the Royal Academy in 1903, she exhibited \\"The Day of Reckoning\\", a wolf pursued by hunters through a forest in snow. A second show a snow scene, featured a wolf baying, while two others are apparently listening to him. \\"While the wolf, in nightly prowl, bays the moon with hideous howl,\\" is the legend with the picture. Austen was described as having great talent with the rare gift of sympathy with the animal world. For many seasons, she exhibited regularly at the annual exhibition of the Royal Society of Painter Etchers, and in 1922, she was elected a member of that society. Austen's early plates were overloaded with background, which the artist ultimately completely discarded. The Little Egret is lost in its surroundings. The plate lacked atmosphere, however much it may have appealed to the ornithologist. The otherwise nicely done Country Mouse suffered from the same fault. Austen was overly engrossed in the animals such that her work upon branches, leaves and blossoms demonstrated signs of a weakened interest. She was also not at her best when drawing exotic birds or beasts, such as a stork or a bear. The Belgian Hare and the Rabbit are works of a middle period. While the Rabbit is considered the finer of the two. Austen, without over- labouring her plate, adopted a severe method for some of her strokes. Austen etched two game birds, the Little jap and A Surrey Fowl. The first is considered good, the second bears comparison with F√©lix Bracquemond's work. Austen's etched line was bold and firm, with an absence of fumbling and indecision. The drypoints were her most recent works. Austen came under the inspiration of the Japanese. A drawing by Keibun ≈åta in the British Museum of mallard flying by moonlight may be compared with Austen's Mallard Pitching. Mallard Rising deals with a similar subject. Widgeon in Winter and A Little Covey are considered good drypoints, the latter showing strong Japanese influence. Austen was elected to the Society of Women Artists (1902), the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers (1907), the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours (1933), and from 1903, she was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society. Austen married her agent Oliver O'Donnell Frick in 1917 and was widowed in 1923. In 1926 she moved to a cottage in Suffolk where she remained for the rest of her life. She died at Bickley, in 1964. Her pictures are held in private collections. Her work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

The Iraqi community is made up of ethnic Arabs, Kurds, Iraqi Turkmen, as well as smaller minority groups. History and population The number of Iraqis in Germany is estimated at around 300,000. In 2015, out of 2,727 asylum applications for Iraqi refugees, only 8.3 percent were accepted.The Iraqi Exodus:Number of Iraqi refugees in Germany Surges Some sources claim there to be just around 40,000 Iraqi refugees residing in Germany. In 2006, Germany granted just 8.3 percent of Iraqi asylum demands, according to the ministry.Refugees find Germany \\"1000 times better than Iraq\\" In 2006, Germany received 2,117 applications for asylum from Iraqis, which is the third highest number in the EU. The country is already home to a sizeable Iraqi population, many of whom were granted protection by the German authorities after fleeing persecution from Saddam Hussein‚Äôs former regime. However, the recognition rate for Iraqis has fallen from an average of 57 per cent between 1997 and 2001, to a mere 11 per cent for the year 2006, which is one of the lowest in the European Union. However, Germany has adopted another policy towards Iraqi refugees which has distinguished it from all other EU states, the German Federal Ministry of the Interior has taken the unique step of systematically revoking the refugee status of thousands of Iraqis who were granted protection before 2003. Since the threat of persecution from the Iraqi Ba‚Äôath regime is no longer present, 18,000 Iraqi refugees who entered the country before the 2003 invasion have thus had their refugee status revoked, placing them in a situation of uncertainty and precariousness. In June 2007, the German government asked the asylum authorities to temporarily suspend the revocation of refugee status for certain groups of Iraqis such as those from Baghdad, single women, and members of religious or ethnic minorities such as Iraqi Assyrians. 70,000+ It was estimated in April 2007 that 14,000 Iraqis were living with 'tolerated status' in Germany, with the threat of possible imminent deportation hanging over them.

It is approximately long and flows through Moosic. Dams in the watershed of the creek include the Glenwood Lake Dam, the Covey Dam, and the Stark Dam. All three dams have associated reservoirs. The creek is a small mountain stream. Course Covey Swamp Creek begins on a hill in Moosic, not far from Scranton. It flows northwest for a few tenths of a mile, off the hill, before turning west- southwest for more than a mile, receiving an unnamed tributary from the left. The creek then turns south-southwest for a short distance before entering Glenwood Lake. It northwest for several tenths of a mile before turning west, crossing Interstate 476, and reaching its confluence with Spring Brook. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Covey Swamp Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. Covey Swamp Creek is a small mountain stream. Its headwaters are on Moosic Mountain. Covey Swamp Creek is dammed by the Glenwood Lake Dam. It is a small dam that is in poor condition as of 1981. The Covey Reservoir and the Stark Reservoir are also in the watershed. Watershed Covey Swamp Creek is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Avoca. Covey Swamp Creek drains a swamp known as Covey Swamp. It also drains a glen known as Rocky Glen. The swamp is situated at an elevation of above sea level. History Covey Swamp Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on January 1, 1990. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1202402. The creek appears on Patton's Philadelphia and Suburbs Street and Road Map, which was published in 1984. It is for this reason that it was added to the Geographic Names Information System. The Covey Creek Coal Company was incorporated in 1900 in Moosic. Two dams in the watershed of Covey Swamp Creek were approved in 1917: Covey Dam and Stark Dam. Both were owned by the Spring Brook Water Supply Company.

These operations include: ‚Ä¢ taking a product g¬∑h of elements g and h, ‚Ä¢ taking an inverse g‚àí1 of element g, ‚Ä¢ deciding whether g = 1\\\\. This class is defined to include both the permutation groups and the matrix groups. The upper bound on the order of G given by G ‚â§ 2N shows that G is finite.  Applications  The black box groups were introduced by Babai and Szemer√©di in 1984. They were used as a formalism for (constructive) group recognition and property testing. Notable algorithms include the Babai's algorithm for finding random group elements,L. Babai, Local expansion of vertex-transitive graphs and random generation in finite groups, Proc. 23rd STOC (1991), 164‚Äì174. the Product Replacement Algorithm, and testing group commutativity. Many early algorithms in CGT, such as the Schreier‚ÄìSims algorithm, require a permutation representation of a group and thus are not black box. Many other algorithms require finding element orders. Since there are efficient ways of finding the order of an element in a permutation group or in a matrix group (a method for the latter is described by Celler and Leedham-Green in 1997), a common recourse is to assume that the black box group is equipped with a further oracle for determining element orders.See H–ælt et al.

During his four decades at McGill, he served terms as Associate Dean of the Faculty of Arts, as well as Director of Undergraduate Studies, Graduate Program Director, and Chair of the Department of Linguistics. He was the Vice-President and President-Elect of the Canadian Linguistic Association from 2002 to 2003. To commemorate his retirement in 2010, a conference entitled \\"Phonology in the 21st Century: In Honour of Glyne Piggott\\" was hosted by McGill University.  Contribution to linguistics  A celebrated scholar in the fields of Phonology and Morphology, Piggott completed his graduate studies at the University of Toronto with a focus on Amerindian languages, particularly Ojibwa. His research on Ojibwa phonology has been instrumental to the analysis of nasal vowels in that language. Further research on syllabification and stress assignment has established a dichotomy between languages whose syllabification relies on the use of codas and those whose right-edge constituents are best analyzed as the onsets of empty-headed syllables. Piggott has been on the editorial board of journals such as The Linguistic Review, member of the advisory board for numerous conferences including the Manchester Phonology Meeting, and an evaluator on departmental review committees, such as for the Linguistics Department of Memorial University in Newfoundland.  Educational outreach  Born and educated in Barbados, Glyne Piggott has been an outspoken supporter of universal education in the Caribbean. His contribution to scholarship, education, and the Barbadian community was celebrated at the 30th anniversary ceremony of the Modernite Association of Toronto in 2014. He is a Special Advisor for the Superkutz Scholarship Foundation, a not-for-profit organization providing scholarships for Montreal youth who lack the funds to pursue higher education, and a member of the Board of Directors and Scholarship Selection Committee for the Quebec Black Medical Association.

Nance was educated at Eltham College. He graduated from Birmingham University with a BSc in chemical engineering in 1976. Nance served for 33 years in the Royal Navy. Since his retirement in 2006 has devoted himself to disaster relief activities in southern Africa and to other high value work. In 2007 he founded the Wings Like Eagles charity, whose purpose is to send helicopters faster to disasters in southern Africa. Wings Like Eagles helped provide 46 hours of helicopter relief along with Mercy Air for the 1.8 million people affected by cyclone IDAI in Mozambique in 2019, and also coordinated the disaster response air group with the UN, which peaked at 23 aircraft. The helicopter company he founded owns one Bell Jet Ranger helicopter, which is based in South Africa and is available for commercial hire, and stands available for disaster relief when possible. Since his retirement, Nance has also been a consultant specializing in transformational leadership and growth. He served for 6 years as the financial trustee of the Humanitarian Logistics Association, assisting in its transformation from zero income, overseeing a major project with the EU, and helping set its strategic direction until 2018. His service for 8 years as the Deputy President of the Royal Naval Association included overseeing a strategic review, a relocation, and the redevelopment of the trustees board, and resulted in him being appointed a Life Vice President on his leaving in 2013. In other charity work, he was a trustee and later the naval vice president of the Officers' Christian Union for 5 years until 2007, who with others in 2005 helped its transformation into the Armed Forces Christian Union of today. He is currently (2019) the Treasurer of Eastleigh Parish, overseeing 7% growth in 7 months, and engaged in its fiscal transformation and its transition to a stand-alone charity. He is also currently a founder trustee of the Chandler's Ford Chaplaincy. He is a public speaker for the charities he supports. He is a member of the Institute of Directors. The performance of all these charities or companies can be checked with the Charity Commission or Companies House, the regulators of charities and companies for England and Wales, or with the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission in the Republic of South Africa. Nance started his long association with naval operations and military aviation in 1977. Most recently from a naval perspective, he was commodore of the Royal Navy Maritime Warfare School based in HMS Collingwood from 2004 to 2006, training commanding officers and 20,000 other naval personnel per year. This included him having the pleasure of accommodating the heads of the navies of the world who came to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar. He was also commanding officer of from 2003 to 2004, notably for the sea trials of the GR9 Harrier jet and the Merlin helicopter. He commanded the 6th Frigate Squadron, at the time the Navy's largest, of 7 frigates based from in 1997 and 1998. His experience in government finance, international policy (in the embassy in Washington, D.C.) and in operations in the UK's Ministry of Defence has proved immensely valuable working with governments, the UN and NGOs in the disaster relief work he now does. Earlier, Nance was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, Military Division, in June 1991, for his service as commander aboard the destroyer in the first Gulf War. During the 1991 Gulf War, HMS Cardiff's Lynx helicopter claimed two Iraqi TNC-45 fast attack craft, two ZHUK fast patrol craft and one Landing Craft resupplying Iraqi forces in Saudi Arabia. He was one of the youngest commanding officers in the Royal Navy when he was promoted to command of the destroyer in 1990. He was twice the senior anti-air warfare officer for all British naval forces in the Gulf Tanker war, and was awarded the General Service Medal (Gulf clasp). As a result of that high intensity front line experience, Nance became a senior trainer on the elite staff of the Flag Officer Sea Training, and for 18 months he was the trainer of UK frigate, destroyer and aircraft carrier commanding officers, with other commanders from Holland, Germany, Portugal, Belgium and Italy. This early experience in high-level, international, cross cultural working in high output delivery is hugely helpful in the disaster response aviation and consultancy work Nance now does. He also survived the sinking of in the Falklands Conflict in 1982. HMS Sheffield was part of the task force sent to the Falkland Islands during the Falklands War. She was struck by an Exocet air-launched anti-ship missile from a Super Etendard aircraft belonging to the Argentine Navy on 4 May 1982 and foundered on 10 May 1982. Nance was awarded the South Atlantic Medal in 1982.

The notion of political subjectivity is an emerging idea in social sciences and humanities. In some sense the term political subjectivity reflects the converging point of a number of traditionally distinct disciplinary lines of investigation, such as philosophy, anthropology, political theory, and psychoanalytic theory. Above all, the current conceptualization of political subjectivity has become possible due to a fundamental shift in humanities and social sciences during the 20th century, commonly known as the linguistic turn. Major figures associated with the question of political subjectivity come from diverse disciplinary backgrounds, such as German philosopher GWF Hegel, French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, French historian Michel Foucault, American literary critic Fredric Jameson, American cultural anthropologist Clifford Geertz, American medical anthropologist Byron J. Good, American philosopher and gender theorist Judith Butler, Canadian medical anthropologist Sadeq Rahimi, Argentine political theorist Ernesto Laclau, Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek, Greek political theorist Yannis Stavrakakis, and many others. The term \\"political subjectivity\\" had been used in earlier literature, such as Steven Brown's book, Political subjectivity: Applications of Q methodology in political science to refer to individual political view points as affected by social and personal psychological processes. But the term was later re-appropriated to refer to the much more intricate idea that the very experience of subjectivity is fundamentally political. According to Sadeq Rahimi in Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity, \\"Politicality is not an added aspect of the subject, but indeed the mode of being of the subject, that is, precisely what the subject is.\\" An early (1981) book by Fredric Jameson, The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act, can be considered one of the forerunners of the notion of political subjectivity. In his book Jameson attributed what he termed a \\"political unconscious\\" to text, asserting that all text has embedded in it, albeit in an implicit form, the encodings of the political history of the environment in which they have been produced. He then proposed ‚Äúthe doctrine of a political unconscious,‚Äù as an analytic method for unearthing the hermeneutically repressed political memories of text, and ‚Äúrestoring to the surface of the text the repressed and buried reality of this fundamental history‚Äù (p. 20). While Jameson's original theory of the political unconscious was primarily a neo-Marxist approach to literary criticism, later proliferation and interdisciplinary cross-fertilization of theories of subjectivity have greatly expanded Jameson's original ideas to include the range of political, cultural and psychological processes within the framework of political subjectivity.

Over Worton was a separate civil parish until 1932, when it was merged with Nether Worton to form the current civil parish of Worton. Archaeology Just north of Holy Trinity parish churchyard is an Anglo-Saxon hlaew (barrow), about in diameter and high. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Worton has the remains of a medieval village cross. In the 20th century it was restored as the parish war memorial. Manor The Domesday Book records that until 1066 one Leofgeat held the manor of Ortune, probably at what is now Nether Worton. After the Norman Conquest of England an estate of three hides and half a yardland at Worton passed to William the Conqueror's half-brother Odo of Bayeux. By 1086 there were 15 households consisting of 10 smallholders and five villagers. Parish church The chancel of Holy Trinity parish church. The east wall is filled by an arcade of seven stepped lancets, the middle three of which have windows. Over Worton has had a parish church since at least the 13th century. The earliest known record of it is from 1254. It had a Norman font, which is now in St John's church, Hempton. In the 1820s Over Worton's curate was the evangelical priest Walter Mayers, who in the 1800s had taught classics at Great Ealing School in what was then Middlesex. His pupils had included John Henry Newman, who then went up to Oxford University. In 1824 Newman was ordained as a Church of England deacon at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. It was at Over Worton in 1824 that Newman preached his first sermon, and thereafter served on several occasions. In the 1840s the curate was William Wilson, an evangelical whose family had owned the manor of Over Worton since 1799. In the 1840s Wilson had the medieval church demolished and the present Church of England parish church of the Holy Trinity built in its place. It is a Gothic revival building, designed by the architect JM Derick and completed in 1844. The north tower was added in 1849 and has two bells. In the churchyard east of the chancel is a pair of stone medieval coffin lids that may be a remnant from the previous church. Other remnants are a memorial tablet and effigy inside the present church. The tablet is in memory of the lawyer Edmund Meese, who died in 1617. The effigy is of a late 16th- or early 17th-century lawyer, and may also represent Edmund Meese. Until 2015 Holy Trinity was part of a single benefice with St James' church, Nether Worton. In March 2015 Nether Worton and Over Worton parishes became part of the Benefice of Westcote Barton with Steeple Barton, Duns Tew and Sandford St. Martin and Over with Nether Worton, also called the Dorn and Ridge Benefice.The Dorn & Ridge Benefice ~ Oxfordshire, UK References Over Worton cross.

He was the biological grandfather of film producer and director Brett Ratner. Early life Leonard Lee Ratner was born in 1918 and grew up on the west side of Chicago. As a young child, he learned to be a salesman selling groceries and other merchandise at his father's produce stand. At age 17, he took an active role in the business. One day Ratner heard about a truck load of bananas that were about to spoil from over ripening. He struck a deal with the truck owner to buy them for $250. By the end of the day, he had resold the bananas to other grocers and fruit stands for a total of $1,750. Ratner graduated from Marshall High School in 1937 before enrolling at Northwestern University. There, he studied accounting in the School of Commerce before dropping out to pursue his business interests. Business career Early career While still in college in 1940, Ratner formed his first company, a mail-order business called United Enterprises Inc. The business, which Ratner ran from his home, sold books, medicine, and novelty merchandise. One of his first big successes came from a pocket-sized adding machine which \\"no decent-sized agency would touch\\". Another product, stainless steel flatware, taught him what would become his signature marketing method - mail order products backed by aggressive radio advertising. Once he showed demand for the product this way, he would then obtain retail distribution (which was generally more cost effective.) The business grew rapidly and by 1942, Ratner was a millionaire. d-CON and The Grant Company After serving in World War II, Ratner returned to Chicago and continued to look for new ventures. In 1950, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation patented warfarin, a new chemical compound which had been in development since the 1930. In the Summer of 1950, Ratner learned of the product and decided to investigate further. He made a trip to Madison and after 30 minutes of discussion was convinced warfarin would be a big seller and signed a licensing agreement. Ratner formed the d-CON Company as an 80% owner and contracted with the S.B. Penick Company, which was already distributing the compound, for an initial supply. By 1951, around 75 companies were distributing warfarin, but none had the impact of d-CON. 1950 d-CON meeting. From left to right: Jermone Garland, d-CON vice president of sales; Joe Abrams, d-CON public relations director; Lee Ratner, d-CON president; Alvin Eicoff, Marfree vice president On September 5, 1950, a trial run of radio advertisements for d-CON commenced. Targeting farmers, the ads aired between 5:30 am and 7:30 am on farm or news programs on stations that reached a large rural audience. The 15 minute infomercials instantly created high demand for the product and advertising spending was quickly increased. Within a short period of time, warfarin/d-CON \\"revolutionized the art of rodent control\\" by replacing manual extermination and highly toxic poisons. To increase momentum for the new product, Ratner organized a 15-day experiment in Middleton, Wisconsin, a town with a particularly bad rat problem. On November 4, d-CON was distributed throughout the community free of charge. By November 19, the town's rat problem was over with no \\"signs of rats in the entire area\\". By December, d-CON was spending $30,000 a week on coast- to-coast ads across 425 radio stations. According to company claims, d-CON was selling more rodent killer in a week than their nearest competitor sold in a year. Explaining d-CON's success over its competitors, Ratner remarked \\"exterminators has a terrific market but no one had ever advertised the product properly.\\" Ratner continued the aggressive advertising campaign, turning to the relatively new medium of television. McKesson & Robbins was contracted for retail distribution. On May 1, 1951, Ratner ceased mail-order distribution of d-CON, having placed the product in more than 40,000 drug, grocery, and hardware stores. Over the first eight months of its existence, d-CON had spent approximately $1 million on advertising, generating sales of $100,000 a week. The success of d-CON led Ratner to expand the business, announcing plans to introduce 10 to 12 household products as subsidiaries of d-CON over the next several years. The first was an insecticide called Fli- Pel. Around 1955, Ratner formed The Grant Company as a subsidiary of the d-CON Company and as a joint venture with his brother Walter. An offshoot, Glenn Chemical Company Inc., was also formed. Products sold by these companies included cleaning supplies under the M-O-Lene brand name, Sonfa cosmetics, various household tools sold by the Grant Tool Company, and the Auto Grant \\"rocket ignition device\\". Leeds & York was formed to handle the advertising of Ratner's products. A 1955, eleven-week-long campaign costing $480,000 featured 1 minute spot ads and 5 minute \\"special service\\" programs for d-CON across 382 radio stations. Simultaneous, a $180,000 mostly television campaign supported M-O-Lene Dry Cleaning products, and approximately $40,000 was being spent weekly on Grant Company mail-order products. d-CON in particular was a huge success and Ratner sold the brand for approximately $7 million in 1956. He continued to sell his other mail-order products under The Grant Company, but Leeds & York ceased operations shortly after the sale of d-CON. Walter left the company in 1962. Lucky Lee Ranch Around 1951, Ratner moved his family to Miami, Florida to explore new business interests. In February, he purchased 18,460 acres of farmland in eastern Lee County for $675,000. The property was ideal to raise livestock and the sale included \\"no less than 1400 healthy cattle\\". It has been suggested that Ratner bought the property as a tax dodge, although his son Joel disputes this saying that Ratner intended the property to continue to be a working farm, with any tax benefits being secondary. Along with the property, Ratner obtained the rights to the \\"CJ\\", \\"OS\\", and \\"Star-B\\" brand names along with the property. On a visit to Lucky Lee Ranch, as the property became known, Ratner's brother-in-law Jim Richmond fell in love with the property and climate. He agreed to be the farm manager and relocated his family there in the summer of 1952. A runway was built on the property so that Ratner could fly his private jet from his home in Miami to the ranch to check up on his investment and/or relax with his family on a regular basis. Joel recalled vacationing on the property regularly and learning to drive there. Within a year, more than 130 acres of vegetables and more than 700 acres of alfalfa, an unusual crop for the area, were planted on Lucky Lee Ranch. The farm had success with the alfalfa crop, attracting the attention of local university researchers, and causing the farm to turn a profit. A deal was soon signed to export hay, the first recorded incidence of hay being exported from Florida. Lehigh Acres Also in 1952, Ratner first met Gerald Gould, who would become one of his closest friends and business associates. Ratner had called a local advertising agency where Gould was working to place an ad in Harper's Bazaar for a perfume he was selling. The advertising manager was suspicious because of a perfume scam run by another party the previous year. Gould was asked to investigate to make sure Ratner was not running a similar scam. He quickly found Ratner's business to be legitimate and the two became friends. Gould and Ratner would often ride horses together on Lucky Lee Ranch. It was on one of these rides in 1954, that Gould suggested Ratner develop the property by slicing it up into a checkerboard pattern and selling off half acre lots. Ratner liked the idea and formed a corporation named the Lee County Land and Title Company for that purpose, naming Gould as president. Ratner brought in two business associates, Manuel Riskin and Edward Shapiro, who had real estate experience. Ratner maintained 48% ownership of new company, while Gould received 22%, and the other partners 15% each. On a fund raising flight to New York, Ratner and Gould drew up what would become the company's signature marketing plan ‚Äì a small flat fee, followed by a small monthly payment. (Initially, $7.50 down and $7.50 a month and most famously $10 down and $10 a month.) After hiring engineers to prep the ranch for development, Lee County Land and Title Company began to sell plots in the new community of Leeland Heights. Advertisements were purchased in major newspapers across the Northeastern and Midwestern United States offering plots of land. The payment structure made the land attractive to average Americans and plots sold quickly. An ad run in a Friday newspaper would lead to $10 bills flowing in by Tuesday. At one point the cash was coming in so fast, trash cans were used to store extra money. Within a year, 12,000 lots were sold, with a minimum total price of $495. However, deeds were not given until payments completed. If payments stopped, the customer lost their investment and the land was resold. Little thought was given to partitioning the land along natural features, or leaving space for basic community needs. Gould later remarked \\"We gave so much thought to selling the land that the normal reservations for commercial properties, schools, all the ancillary things you need in a community, weren't made. We even had canals that ran uphill. I don't know any mistake you could make that we didn't make.\\" Much to the amazement of the partners, soon customers were asking the company to build them homes. Thus, the Lehigh Building & Development Company was formed to expand the operation into home building. The Lehigh Industries & Investing Corporation was formed to offer central water and sewage systems under its Lehigh Acres Utilities Company subsidiary, and later took ownership of the building company. Ratner owned 51% of the investment arm of Lehigh Acres. The Sheldon Leasing Company was formed to build a shopping center around 1958. Lehigh Memorial Park Inc. was created to operate a cemetery in 1962. With demand high, the Lee County Land and Title Company started purchasing more land in the area. By 1959, it owned 30,000 acres of land in what would become Lehigh Acres, of which 18,000 were under active development. By using a limited set of pre-made designs consumer could pick from, the company was able to complete a new home build in 90 to 120 days. The Lee County Land and Title Company also operated a motel on the property, and built a civic auditorium dedicated to public use. Earlier failures to plan for utilities created a constant cash crunch. Marketing was ratcheted up. In the middle of winter, bikini-clad models under heat lamps showed off Lehigh model homes. Elephants were paraded around the Midwest carrying banners saying \\"Fly to Florida for peanuts!\\" Private planes were used to fly Northerners to Lehigh to view the \\"Charmed Circle\\" of model homes and luscious gardens. On September 14, 1963, Ratner and the other original partners sold the Lee County Land and Title Company to Sacred Heart Parish (the territorial division of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Austin, Texas) for $12.5 million in the form of notes and a purchase-money mortgage. Sacred Heart in turn lent the legal ownership of the property to the Lehigh Acres Development Corporation, which was wholly owned by Howard M. Lawn. Ratner was retained by the new company in a consulting role. Ratner was a 25% owner and chairman of the board of the Southern Radio and Television Company (originally Lehigh Acres Radio & Television Company), which was founded in 1960 with the aim of serving the Lehigh Acres community and making the area more attractive to live in. Southern's application to build a broadcasting tower was approved in December 1966 on land donated by the Lee County Land and Title Company. The population of Lehigh Acres boomed from 500 families in 1960 to 5000 by the end of the decade. In 1969, Lehigh Acres Development Corporation was purchased by the Scientific Resources Corporation in an all-stock deal. Two years later, Scientific Resources went bankrupt. Further real estate ventures & oil exploration Spurred by the apparent success of Lehigh, Ratner bought property throughout Florida. In 1957, he was part of a lawsuit against the Florida government seeking to overturn a new law preventing the filling of submerged land in Boca Ciega Bay. (To create valuable waterfront property, developers would buy unusable partially submerged coastline and fill it to create usable land.) From 1958 to 1964, the sought to develop property on the Venetian Islands in St. Petersburg under the Venetian Isle Development Corporation, a subsidiary of the Lee County Land and Title Company. In 1965, he and Gould conceived of a \\"traveling house.\\" The house consisted of two 10 ft by 40 ft sections carried on separate trailers that were bolted together at points of display. Its purchase was to show northerners \\"something about the types of new houses that are available in the south\\", according to press coverage. In June 1958, Ratner formed the Leeco Gas & Oil Company for purposes of oil exploration. Three gas wells were placed in Brown County in December, with a combined operating capacity of 2.5 million cubic feet daily. A number of additional drilling permits were obtained in Texas, but by 1960 the business had \\"practically petered out\\" according to a 1963 FCC hearing on Southern Radio & Television. At some point the business was revived. Additional Texas gas wells were drilled in 1964. By 1975, had expanded westward into Colorado and California. Ratner's Four R's Producing Company, formed in 1958, initially sought to develop oil producing properties before becoming involved in real estate investment. It became part of Lehigh Acres by early 1962 and was inactive by 1964. Other ventures From 1956 until 1961, Ratner owned a carpet business called Leonard Carpet Manufacturing Company. He was involved in soilless farming through Hydroponics International, a subsidiary of the Lee County Land and Title Company until it was dissolved in 1963. In 1962, he formed the Bahamas corporation Sutters International the distribute product internationally. Ratner was an elected director of the Miami National Bank from May 1961 until May 1963, when he was not re-elected \\"due to his inactivity.\\" In 1969, Ratner launched a computer programming correspondence course under the name Computer College of Technology. He claimed his 50-part course could teach even a high school dropout to program for a one-time payment of $545. The price included teleconferencing support if the student got stuck. Initial response to the product was strong due to high employment demand in the computer industry, which was paying novice programmers $700 a month to start at the time. Ratner based his later operations out of Miami Beach. Business strategy Ratner's motto was \\"you can sell anything if you use radio to introduce it.\\" In 1951, he outlined his business strategy as follows: #Mail order is the only way to start a new product that you want to get in the big time. With the right dramatized appeal, distribution can be forced by arousing public demand. #Once you've got a brand started, get out of mail order. #Spend money to make money. #Radio is the best means of getting a product started. Later, Ratner would use television to sell products directly to consumers in a manner similar to later telemarketers such as Ron Popeil. For example, if he was selling a vegetable slicer for $2.98, he would offer consumers who called within the next fifteen minutes a bonus peeler \\"worth\\" an additional $2.98. And the first 100 callers got a bonus french fry slicer \\"worth\\" $2, offering $7.96 of value for only $2.98. In reality, the three products combined only cost Ratner about 40¬¢, leaving plenty of profit. The $2.98 price point (which was also used for d-CON) was chosen because his research showed that products above $3 were unappealing to many consumers. As of 1954, Ratner was spending more than $1 million a year on 10-minute infomercials across 300 TV stations. Reputation Ratner had \\"dark curly hair, [a] charismatic smile, and [an] electric personality\\" according to his friend and long-time business associate Gerald Gould. He maintained diverse business interests and had a passion for developing new products. Sponsor magazine described him as \\"a hustling, rough- hewn Chicago merchandiser\\" and compared him to the Pied Piper due to Ratner's rat removal prowess. In 2009, Gould reminisced \\"I loved Lee Ratner ... He had the uncanny ability to figure out what to say to a prospective buyer. He knew price was not the deciding factor.\\" He was considered generous with his money, refusing to leave less than a $5 tip at restaurants, for example. The rapid rise of d-CON has been cited as a case study in effective mail-order advertising and called \\"as brilliant a record for a new product as you're likely to find anywhere, anytime.\\" At one time, Ratner's businesses were the eight largest purchaser of television ads in the United States. He has been described as \\"the king of telemarketers\\" from the early days of television. A 1954 article in Broadcasting Telecasting declared \\"no mention of mail order on TV would be complete without mentioning the success of the active Lee Ratner.\\" Personal life Ratner had a brother named Walter and a sister. He married Esther Richmond and the couple had three sons ‚Äì Joel, Ronald, and Ira. In 1959, Ratner purchased a race horse named Illinois and hired famous jockey Lester Piggott to ride it. Together with Gould, he formed Lehigh Acres Throughbread Farms in 1964 for breeding and training race horses. Footnotes : The story is often told that Ratner bought Lucky lee Ranch specifically to protect him from capital gains taxes on the recent sale of the d-CON company. An alternate suggestion is the development of Lehigh Acres was begun to offset the sale of d-CON. Neither suggestion is possible, as the property was purchased in 1951 and development began in 1954, but d-CON was not sold until 1956. There was still a tax advantage locally, as the land received an agricultural income designation for valuation in property taxes, as opposed to the (almost always) higher 'Fair Market Value'.

In 2013 the system was being used by at least 11,500 branches, and was processing some six million transactions every day. It has come under criticism since at least 2000 for errors in the system which, according to press reports, may have caused the loss of dozens of jobs, unwarranted prison sentences, bankruptcies, and one documented suicide.\\"How to suppress a scandal, Pt 94,\\" Private Eye, issue 1388 - Archived page Original In September 2020, the Post Office declared it would not oppose many postmasters' appeals against conviction.https://news.sky.com/story/post- office-wont-block-appeals-of-33-wrongfully-convicted-horizon-scandal- postmasters-12087598  Purpose and design  The system cost ¬£1 billion and was designed by ICL/Fujitsu Services. According to Post Office Ltd, the name Horizon encompasses: * the software, both bespoke and software packages * the computer hardware and communications equipment installed in branch and the central data centres * the software used to control and monitor the systems * the testing and training systems The system was originally introduced in 1995 on a pilot basis in a small number of Post Offices, alongside a joint work programme between the Department of Social Security's Benefits Agency and Post Office Counters Ltd. The objective of this programme (known as the BA/POCL Programme) was to provide an automated system for making benefits payments through Post Offices and thereby reduce fraud. At the Conservative Party conference in October 1995, the social security minister Peter Lilley brandished a smartcard as the intended replacement for the benefit book, declaring that, with the Benefits Agency and ICL, Post Office Counters Ltd would install smartcard reading terminals at every branch, through a private finance initiative (PFI) to be delivered under a commercial contract. At the time smartcards were under consideration as part of the full system, but a final choice of technologies had not been made. After a lengthy competitive procurement exercise which began in late 1994, the contract for further development and full implementation in all Post Offices was awarded in May 1996 to ICL's Pathway division, which had been created for the purpose. ICL later became part of Fujitsu. In 1999, four years and ¬£700m of taxpayers' money after the pilot scheme began, the Government, by now Labour, stopped the scheme in its tracks. The Department of Social Security withdrew from the deal, leaving ICL/Fujitsu to run the system. ICL has since criticised the PFI payment criterion: it would have been paid partly on how many customers Post Offices attracted. \\"Looking back, I think it was over-ambitious,\\" said Stuart Sweetman in 2001, as the then group managing director of customer and banking services for Consignia, the name used at the time for Post Office Counters Ltd. \\"You can't export all the risk to a supplier.\\"  Problems  Problems with the system were first reported by Alan Bates, the sub-postmaster at Craig-y-Don, in around 2000, he reported his concerns to Computer Weekly in 2004, who finally gathered sufficient evidence to publish them in 2009. A campaign group on the issue, Justice for Sub-postmasters Alliance (JFSA) was formed by Bates and others in September 2009.  Initial Post Office Ltd investigation  An initial investigation failed, at first, to find the cause of the problems. As a result, an independent investigative firm Second Sight were brought in to conduct a separate, independent inquiry, in 2012. At around this time, Paula Vennells became CEO of the Post Office.  Second Sight report  In July 2013, Post Office Ltd admitted (after an interim review by Second Sight) that software defects with Horizon had indeed occurred, but that the system was effective. The review discovered problems in 2011 and 2012, when Post Office Ltd discovered defects which had caused a shortfall of up to ¬£9,000 at 76 Post Office branches. However, more than 150 sub-postmasters continued to raise issues with the system, which they claimed had, by error, put them in debt by tens of thousands of pounds, and that in some cases they lost their contracts or went to prison. The report ‚Äì which was treated as confidential ‚Äì described the Horizon system as, in some cases, \\"not fit for purpose\\". The lead investigator for Second Sight claimed that there were about 12,000 communication failures every year, with software defects at 76 branches and old and unreliable hardware. The system had, according to the report, not been tracking money from lottery terminals, tax disc sales or cash machines ‚Äì and the initial Post Office Ltd investigation had not looked for the cause of the errors, instead accusing the sub-postmasters of theft The report was dismissed by the Post Office. However, it was leaked to the BBC in September 2014. The BBC's article on the report also said that training on the system was not good enough, that \\"equipment was outdated\\", and that \\"power cuts and communication problems made things worse\\". Post Office Ltd then went into mediation with the affected sub-postmasters. By December, however, MPs had criticised Post Office Ltd for how it handled the sub-postmasters' claims, and 140 of those affected had withdrawn their support for the Post Office-run mediation scheme. 144 MPs had been contacted by sub-postmasters about the issue, and James Arbuthnot, the MP leading on the matter, accused the organisation of rejecting 90% of applications for mediation. Post Office Ltd said that the claims by Arbuthnot were \\"regrettable and surprising\\". Arbuthnot further claimed that Post Office Ltd had been \\"duplicitous\\", and said that: In February 2015, ComputerWorld UK, a UK trade magazine for IT managers, reported that Post Office Ltd were obstructing the investigation by refusing to hand over key files to Second Sight. Post Office Ltd claimed in the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee hearing of 3 February 2015 that they \\"have been working with Second Sight over the last few weeks on what we agreed at the outset. We have been providing the information.\\", but the lead investigator for Second Sight, when asked by Adrian Bailey if that were the case, said \\"No, it is not.\\", as he had not been given access to prosecution files, which he needed to back up his suspicions that Post Office Ltd had brought cases against sub-postmasters with \\"inadequate investigation and inadequate evidence\\". He said that these files were still outstanding eighteen months after they had been requested.  Investigation cancelled  In March 2015, Private Eye and other sources reported the news that Post Office Ltd had ordered Second Sight to end their investigation just one day before the report was due to be published, and to destroy all the paperwork which they had not handed over. Post Office Ltd then scrapped the independent committee set up to oversee the investigation, as well as the mediation scheme for sub- postmasters, and published a report which cleared themselves of any wrongdoing. Of the 136 cases, 56 had been closed, and Post Office Ltd would put the rest forward for \\"mediation\\" unless a court ruling prevented them from doing so. After ending the inquiry, Post Office Ltd said that there were no widescale problems, and that:  Civil action  In 2019, class action civil litigation, Bates & Ors v Post Office Ltd,Case No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 and HQ17X04248 brought by 550 sub-postmasters was settled by the Post Office. Significant fees for counsel, repayment of legal financing, and payment of the legal financing \\"success fee\\" will be deducted from the ¬£58 million settlement. Mr Justice Fraser, the judge overseeing the civil action noted that the approach of the Post Office to the case: Vennells subsequently apologised to workers affected by the scandal, saying: In March 2020 the Criminal Cases Review Commission has so far decided to refer for appeal the convictions of 39 Post Office applicants. The Commission will be referring all those cases, which involve convictions for theft, fraud and false accounting, on the basis of the argument that each prosecution amounted to an abuse of process. In May 2020 the Criminal Cases Review Commission has decided to refer a further eight Post Office workers‚Äô convictions for appeal ‚Äì this brings to 47 the number of cases to be sent for appeal so far on grounds related to the Horizon computer system.  Possibility of criminal action  In December 2019, The Register reported that Mr Justice Fraser would be passing a file on to the Director of Public Prosecutions. A number of cases are under review by the Criminal Cases Review Commission raising the possibility of actions for malicious prosecution. Arbuthnot, by now sitting in the House of Lords as Baron Arbuthnot of Edrom, said in November 2019:  Other enquiries  Evidence about the case was also heard by Parliament's 'Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee' on 10 March 2020. In February 2020, Prime Minister Boris Johnson committed to an independent inquiry. On 19 March 2020, in a debate in the House of Commons, Kevan Jones MP criticized former Post Office CEO, Paula Vennells, for her role in the scandal. In a written ministerial statement on 10 June 2020 Paul Scully (Minister for Small Business, Consumers and Labour Markets) announced the scope of the Independent Review into the Post Office Horizon IT System and Trials.  Individual cases  * Jo Hamilton, from South Warnborough in Hampshire, claims she first noticed problems with the Horizon system in 2005 and lost ¬£36,000; she pleaded guilty to false accounting after trying to hide the resulting incorrect deficit. She was originally charged with theft, but was told that if she repaid the money and pleaded guilty to 14 counts of false accounting, she would be less likely to go to prison. At the time, she was told that she was the only person who had had these problems. She pleaded guilty, and, under the terms of her contract, she paid her wages for the next ten months to Post Office Ltd, and had to remortgage her house to pay the money. James Arbuthnot was her MP. * Noel Thomas, a man who had worked for the Royal Mail for 42 years, spent his 60th birthday in prison as a result of the errors. * Sarah Burgess Boyd, from Newcastle upon Tyne, said she lost her life savings in repaying an incorrect shortfall. * Rubina Nami was jailed for 12 months in 2010 for false accounting of ¬£43,000. She and her husband fell behind on mortgage payments and in February 2013 bailiffs seized their home and changed the locks. They slept in their van for six weeks before being given a one-bed housing association flat by the local council. * According to Private Eye, there has been one documented suicide.

The ship, laid down in 1923 and launched 12 November 1925, had been completed by Aktien-Gesellschaft ‚ÄûWeser\\", Bremen and delivered to the French as part of World War I reparations. After a 1937 refit, including boilers increasing speed to , Athos II resumed Far East service. The ship started World War II in French national service until captured by the Allies in North Africa and then being turned over to the United States War Shipping Administration by Free French authorities at Casablanca for operation as a troop transport allocated to the United States Army until returned to the French government in March 1946. Athos II transported French troops to French Indochina, Korea, during the Suez intervention and lastly Algeria in the postwar years as well as a period carrying North African pilgrims to Jeddah. World War II French national service At the outbreak of World War II Athos II was still on the Far Eastern route but on 1 February 1940 at Colombo, Celyon joined the Australian/New Zealand convoy, designated US1 for secrecy and transporting about 13,500 troops to North Africa, under an escort then led by . After passage through the Suez Canal and return to France Athos II began Marseilles, Egypt and Syria service until the 22 June 1940 German-French armistice when the ship was laid up at Alexandria, Egypt along with other French ships seized in the Suez Canal and Egyptian waters. In addition to the merchant ships was a French naval force, Force X, under Admiral Rene-Emile Godfroy that had been operating with the British fleet out of Alexandria. After the fall of France with German controlled Vichy France controlling French ports the French were faced with the options of continuing with the Allies under General de Gaulle, demilitarizing or being sunk by the British. The British action against the French fleet at Oran stalled demilitarization but that resumed after further negotiations with the result reduction of French fleet's manpower, some 4,000 men, to one-third was required. Two thousand French sailors had already left Alexandria when Athos II was allowed to sail on 13 July 1940 with the 1,000 remaining personnel of Force X and some merchant crew members to France. In September 1940 repatriated French troops from Syria and then became the guard ship at Algiers until captured by the Allies in November 1942 during Operation Torch. Allied service with United States War Shipping Administration On 8 March 1943 Athos II was turned over to United States War Shipping Administration (WSA) control by French Authorities at Casablanca and on 1 April 1943 began operation as a WSA transport allocated to the United States Army and operated by French Lines, Inc. as agent.Though never bareboat chartered to or operated by the Army the association was such that the ship is sometimes seen as USAT Athos II. Athos II underwent conversion May‚ÄîNovember 1943 for WSA troop service by Turbine Engineering Corporation of New York. In December the ship made a voyage to the United Kingdom, returning in January, 1944.

Many breweries and microbreweries produce seasonal beers. Seasonal beers may be produced when fresh ingredients are available during various seasons, per climatic conditions during the time of the year, and also as a tradition. Furthermore, seasonal beer is produced based upon seasons, holidays, festivals and events. By season Spring Gueuze lambic beer, produced by Cantillon Brewery Bock was traditionally produced during winter for consumption during Lent and Easter in the spring. It was also traditionally produced for consumption during winter. Lambic has been described as a seasonal beer that is prepared during the winter for consumption in spring and summer months. Traditionally, the preparation of lambic includes leaving the wort mixture outside overnight to absorb wild yeasts in the air. It is also prepared with beer yeast for fermentation and bacteria such as lactobacillus and acetobacter for aging, after which time during the warmer spring and summer seasons, the wild yeasts and souring bacteria in the mix predominantly influence the final product's flavor and characteristics. They are aged in wooden barrels or stainless steel tanks. Lambics are typically liberally hopped as a preservative to control bacteria levels, however the hops are usually aged as to not add too much bitterness. Some varieties are aged for years. They typically have a slight sweetness, along with a distinct sourness. Summer A saison beer Summer seasonal beers are typically formulated for warmer weather, and are typically light-bodied. They may have citrus or fruity flavor, which may be accented with the use of honey, brewing spices and floral hops. Many summer seasonal beers are ales and wheat ales. Saison (literally the French translation of season) has been described as a summer seasonal beer. As a beer style, the saison originated from ales brewed during the cooler and less active months in farmhouses in Wallonia, the French-speaking region of Belgium, and then stored for drinking by the farm workers during the summer months. General characteristics include a fruity flavor and smell, light or bitter hoppiness, pale orange body, thick head, and a light- to medium-body. Autumn Autumn seasonal beers may incorporate the use of spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg, which serves to associate the season with the beer's flavor, or to create a \\"frame of reference unique to that season\\". In Germany and the United States, Oktoberfestbier or M√§rzen, originally produced for the Oktoberfest celebrations held in Munich, are commonly released throughout September and October. Beers served at modern Oktoberfests tend to be lighter lagers, while traditional recipes are amber-colored, dry, and malty. Bi√®re de Garde (English: \\"beer for keeping\\") is a seasonal beer that is traditionally brewed in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France. It is brewed in Autumn, after which it is stored during the winter, to be consumed during the next year. Bi√®re de Garde was originally brewed in farmhouses in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. Varieties of Bi√®re de Garde are produced by some American craft brewers. Some of these American varieties have a high alcohol by volume content, ranging from 7-9%. Pumpkin ale is often brewed as an autumn seasonal beer. Well-known examples include Saint Arnold's Pumpkinator, Shipyard's Pumpkinhead, and Schlafly's Pumpkin Ale. Winter Founders Brewing Company's Curmudgeon Old Ale Traditionally, bock was a seasonal beer brewed at winter for consumption at both winter and during Lent and Easter in the spring. Winter warmers are a type of winter seasonal beer. These include old ales and mild ales that have been brewed during the winter months. Prior to the times of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-eighteenth century in England, some winter warmers were aged in barrels for months, and even years, which added to their flavor profile. The barrels were typically made from oak. During this time, tannins from the wooden barrels served to add flavor notes to winter warmers, and wild yeasts added a mild sour flavor. Winter warmers also sometimes have spices added for additional flavor and tend to be full-bodied, darker, and malt-driven styles. Wassail-style beer is sometimes described or categorized as a winter warmer. By holiday Seasonal beers produced for Thanksgiving and Christmas include pumpkin ale and gingerbread-flavored beer. Holiday spiced beers may also be brewed with orange zest to add flavor. Christmas beer Christmas beer is seasonal beer brewed for consumption during Christmas or the winter in a number of countries. Some varieties of Christmas beer may be strong and spiced with a variety of unusual ingredients. Spices used in Christmas beer varieties includes allspice, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg and star anise. Christmas beers are sometimes referred to as winter warmers. The style of beer dates back to at least 2,000 years, when it was produced to celebrate the Saturnalia during winter. This tradition was carried on in the Middle Ages by monks, who would produce beer for the Saturnalia. By festival Oktoberfest A waitress with Hacker-Pschorr, one of the traditional Oktoberfestbiers brewed for Oktoberfest festival. She wears a dirndl, a traditional women's dress of Bavaria. Some seasonal beers are produced for the Oktoberfest festival. Oktoberfest seasonal beers include those named and labeled as \\"Oktoberfest\\" (e.g. Oktoberfestbiers), ales, spiced ales, pumpkin ales, and others. Oktoberfestbiers are the beers that have been served at the festival since 1818, and are supplied by six breweries: Spaten, L√∂wenbr√§u, Augustiner-Br√§u, Hofbr√§u-M√ºnchen, Paulaner and Hacker-Pschorr.

Buag, Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines. The parish church, dedicated to Saint Catherine of Siena, is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bayombong. Parish history Christianity had its origins in Bambang when the Dominicans, led by Father Tomas Gutierrez, established the mission called Ytuy in 1609 to convert and serve the local tribe called Isinay. The present-day towns of Bambang, Bayombong, Aritao, and Kayapa comprised the said mission. Bambang, then called San Bernardo, was officially created as a town on July 5, 1747. The Dominicans established their convent in Bambang in 1751 with Father Cristobal Rodriguez as its first vicar. Years later, the construction of the present church started. In 1772, the construction of the church commenced under Father Domingo Caro, OP. The church was completed before the turn of the century, in 1791. The remains of a certain Rosa de Santa Maria is recorded to have been interred in the church, under one of the side altarpieces dedicated to Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary. Rosa de Santa Maria, an Igorot woman, is one of the two native Filipina \\"flowers of sanctity\\". Architecture The church fa√ßade has been described as \\"nearly identical\\" to the fa√ßade of the Dupax del Sur Church, save for a few differences with regards to its details such as the absence of the blind windows on the first level, a slightly steeper pediment, and the presence of clay insets adorning oculus on the third level. A concrete canopy covering the main portal is a later addition into the structure. The four level bell tower is also very similar to that of the Dupax del Sur Church except for the plainer, plastered look and more pronounced cornices marking the boundaries of each level. Clay insets bearing the years 1775 and 1779 suggests the dates when the belfry level was completed.

Led by Ian Edwards (1943-2007), the band existed in relative obscurity until relocating to Germany in 1964 where they achieved national success. During the band's three- year stint in Germany, they released three albums under their name, exclusive to the country until their re-release. They also released two cover albums featuring material by The Beatles with the name, The Koppykats. History The band formed as a jazz group in 1958, and performed under the name, The Zodiacs. The group came together following an audition at a local venue called Savoy Hall. In the spring of 1960, Ian Edwards departed from his band, The Deltones, and joined The Zodiacs. From that point on, the band became known as Ian and the Zodiacs, and shifted their style from jazz to rock and roll. Following several personnel changes, the lineup for the group included Edwards as lead vocalist, Pete Wallace on lead guitar, Geoff Bethell on piano, Charlie Flynn (stage name: Wellington Wade) on bass guitar, and Cliff Roberts on drums. The band played top venues in the area, and became the resident group for St. Lukes Hall (The Jive-Hive). During their touring, they found their manager, Ralph Webster. On 4 January 1962, Mersey Beat released a poll citing the band was the eleventh most popular Merseyside group. The band released their first single on the Oriole label in 1963 to limited success. Edwards recalled, regarding their inability to achieve success in England, \\"We spent too much time at the Grapes\\". The Grapes being the place where bands would take breaks from performing. In May 1964, the band got rid of Bethell and auditioned Geoff Bamford to replace Roberts on drums. Later in 1964, the band travelled to Hamburg, Germany for what was supposed to be a month of touring. The band would remain in the country for the next three years after gaining widespread popularity amidst their touring and television appearances. During the summer of 1965 they were a resident group at Butlin's Skegness, a UK Lincolnshire holiday camp. Edwards' distinctive vocals helped develop the group's reputation, and set them apart from other acts. Their act was centered around US, and UK hits along with some of their own original material. They became promoted by Manfred Weissleder, owner of the Star-Club, who featured them in his various clubs, and were joined by drummer Joe Walsh. Following a car accident in May 1965, Wallace and Walsh departed, and were replaced by Freddie Smith and Arthur Ashton. The band released three albums, all of which charted in Germany, during their stay in the country. The albums, Star Club 7, Just Listen to Ian and the Zodiacs, and Locomotive!, were all released on the Star Club label. The material from the albums ranged from rock and roll, pop rock, and later soul influences. Outside the band name, they released two cover albums consisting of The Beatles' compositions under the name, The KoppyKats. Their biggest selling hit in the UK, 1965's double album The Beatles Beat, was recorded on a limited budget, but was still relatively successful. Another Beatles cover album, Gears Again, followed with less success. In support of the albums, they released \\"Nowhere Man\\" and \\"Help!\\" as singles. The albums sold well thanks to the lower prices in comparison to The Beatles' releases. The band released several singles, all on different labels, to the UK and the United States, and, despite failing to chart in the UK, still managed to achieve a regional hit in the US. Their single, \\"The Crying Game\\", became a number one hit in Texas, selling 250,000 copies. The band would have toured the US, but could not as they did not have green cards. The band continued to tour throughout Germany until July 1967. Edwards' wife had fallen ill so he disbanded the group to return to England. He reformed the band the following year with German musicians, to lesser success. Two other incarnations of the band formed, one in 2000, touring Germany until 2003, and another in 2004. From 2004 until his death in 2007 he made a comeback in Germany, performing at festivals in Hamburg, Weimar, Berlin and Cologne, as well as in Liverpool¬¥s Cavern Club. He was backed by the German musicians Manfred Jung (bass), J√ºrgen Pfingst (lead guitar), Dr.Joachim Wagner (rhythm guitar) and Raimund Jung (drums). The backing group from Cologne, Germany, still performs as Ian's Zodiacs and as The Roaring Fourties, and is also well known in Liverpool. In the 1990s, the band's albums were re-released by the Repertoire label. Five of the group's tracks, \\"Beechwood\\", \\"It Ain't Necessarily So\\", \\"Secret Love\\", \\"Let's Turkey Trot\\", and \\"You Can Think Again\\", have also appeared on the 1989 compilation album, This Is MerseyBeat. A greatest hits album called Wade in the Water was distributed by RPM which was composed of re-mastered songs by the band.

Before it was built, the former seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ilagan was located in San Fernando Church in Barangay Bagumbayan, Ilagan City, Isabela. Old Saint Ferdinand Cathedral History Ilagan had its beginnings as an encomienda of Don Hernandez de Paz circa 1617. The town was also founded as a mission of the Dominican priests called San Miguel de Bolo on April 21, 1619. After the local revolt in 1621 by the locals of Ilagan and nearby towns of Naguilian and Baculud, nothing has been written about the town‚Äôs history until it was re-found by Father Pedro Jimenez, O.P. in 1678. During that time, it was officially named as San Fernando de Ilagan. It was also formally accepted as a Dominican mission in March 1686. Architectural History Records tell that the construction of the church of Ilagan started at around 1696 to 1700. In 1777, Father Pedro de San Pedro, O.P. started the construction of the belfry. Later on, the tower was competed by Father Joaquin Sancho, O.P. in 1783, the date indicated in the clay inset found at the top of the tower. The church was recorded to have sustained heavy damages during a typhoon in 1866. It was torn down by the parish priest in the hopes of erecting a new structure. The current church structure is no longer the old stone structure erected in the Spanish-era. Only the tower remains intact. New Gamu Cathedral In 2013, the episcopal seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ilagan was transferred from the Saint Ferdinand Parish Church to a new structure in Barangay Upi, in the town of Gamu, Isabela in reference to the decree by Pope Francis. The decree also re-dedicates the Cathedral to Saint Michael the Archangel and in honor of Bishop Miguel Gatan Purugganan, although the diocese remains under the patronage of Saint Ferdinand of Castile.

The novel was made into a 1974 feature-length film of the same name. Plot Sheikh Nuruddin is a respected dervish in an Islamic monastery in eighteenth century Bosnia. He learns his brother Harun has been arrested by the Ottoman authorities but he struggles to determine exactly what happened and what he should do. He narrates the story as a kind of elaborate suicide note ‚Äúfrom a need stronger than benefit or reason‚Äù and regularly misquotes (or misunderstands) the Quran, the sacred scriptures of his faith. Slowly the Sheikh starts to probe and question society, power and life in general. Speaking the truth leads to his being physically assaulted in the streets and even arrested briefly. Ultimately he fights and challenges the injustice of the world by employing deceit which succeeds at the expense of innocent life. Nuruddin replaces the old Kadƒ± but is in turn corrupted by the need to uphold the original deceit. Principal characters * Sheikh Ahmed Nuruddin‚Äîthe protagonist who is a religious everyman. His name Ahmed means friend in Arabic, whilst Nuruddin means ‚Äúlight of the Religion‚Äù. * Hasan‚ÄîNuruddin‚Äôs principal friend outside the tekke. * Mullah Yusuf‚Äîthe young student Nuruddin has brought into the tekke as an orphan, who spies on him for outside interests. Subject Matter The principal theme of Death and the Dervish is ‚Äúmalodu≈°nost,‚Äù a Bosnian word meaning diminished or reduced soul (translates as faint-heartedness, cowardice or indifference). The most popular interpretation of this popular novel is that Selimoviƒá employed a fictional Ottoman setting to obscure a real critique of life in Communist Yugoslavia. Another important component is the fact that the story reflects a real-life incident in the author‚Äôs own life, when his brother, an ardent Communist functionary, was imprisoned and executed by Communist authorities after the war as an example to others for a very minor offense.

Career  Lee published a book, Will China fail? - the limits and contradictions of market socialism, in 2007. An updated second edition was released in 2009. The subject of this book is the complexities and risks associated with China's approach to economic development, which Lee asserts to be flawed, unsustainable, dangerously unstable, and unlikely if not incapable of providing a foundation for the continuation of China's 'peaceful rise' or 'peaceful development'. In 2014, he co-authored a report with Paul Dibb titled Why China Will Not Become The Dominant Power in Asia which received considerable attention.The Australian The report rejects the idea that America should step back from the region and treat China as a strategic equal in Asia; that China's military, economic and demographic shortcomings are considerable; that a China-dominated Asian region is unlikely without American strategic withdrawal; and defence planning in Australia should not assume Chinese dominance as inevitable. Lee has also emphasised the importance and desirability of Japanese power for a stable balance in the Indo-Pacific in the current century.
