It is best known for containing the United States' largest and the world's second largest non- subglacial underground lake, The Lost Sea. In addition to the lake, the caverns contain an abundance of crystal clusters called anthodites, stalactites, stalagmites, and a waterfall.  History  Located in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains, the caverns are named after their former owner, a Cherokee native American, Chief Craighead. The caverns were formerly used by the Cherokee as a meeting place and later they were mined by Confederate soldiers for saltpeter, a commodity necessary to the manufacture of gunpowder. It was also used as a hideout for moonshiners https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-lost-sea-exploring-americas-largest- underground-lake-tennessee/ In 1939, explorers found the remains of a Pleistocene jaguar. The persons who made the discovery were cave guides Jack Kyker and Clarence Hicks, who were exploring in the cave during their off hours. They reported their find to Dr. W. J. Cameron and W. E. Michael of Sweetwater, who were the current owners of the cave. The owners submitted the bones to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where they were identified as bones of a very large jaguar and an elk fawn. George Gaylord Simpson, a vertebrate paleontologist at the museum, subsequently visited Craighead Caverns in May 1940. During his visit, he recovered additional jaguar bones and made casts of several jaguar footprints in the mud floor of the cave. His excavation and findings are reported in American Museum Novitates, No. 1131 (August 6, 1941) on pages 1‚Äì12. The report includes photographs of the bones and footprints. A mushroom farm was operated in the cave from 1939 to 1940. The manure for this operation was supplied from Fort Oglethorpe, where many horses were stabled. The mushroom beds were located in the Big Room, a few hundred feet northeast of the Historic Entrance. In 1947, a wooden dance floor was built in this same area of the cave, and a nightclub, known as the \\"Cavern Tavern\\", was operated in the cave. Craighead Caverns was added to the National Park Service list of National Natural Landmarks in 1974.  The Lost Sea  Visitor's Center The lake was discovered in 1905 by a thirteen-year-old boy named Ben Sands. As the story goes Sands, who often played in the cave, happened upon a small opening and crawled through. The room was so large he was unable to see the ends of the room with his lantern, so he threw balls of mud in all directions and heard splashes. When he went back home and told people of his discovery they were hesitant to believe him. By the time Ben convinced his father to go back down with him to explore it further, the water level had risen, hiding the cave entrance from them. It was rediscovered by local explorers several years later. The visible surface of the lake measures long and wide () at normal \\"full\\" capacity. Cave divers have explored several rooms that are completely filled with water, without reaching the end of the cave. This exploration was conducted in the 1970s. For many years The Lost Sea was considered the world's largest underground lake and is still recognized as the world's second largest non-subglacial underground lake after Dragon's Breath Cave, Namibia. Boat tours of the lake are still given and for many people are the highlight of the tour. In times of extreme drought (such as 2007-08) the lake recedes significantly and the management had to extend the walkway and the boat dock in order to be able to provide the boat tours. According to the management of the Lost Sea, the water level in the lake dropped 28 feet below its normal level at the height of the drought. At such times visitors see a much larger cavern above the lake surface. The sea was featured on CBS's America Wonders series. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-lost-sea-exploring-americas-largest- underground-lake-tennessee/ References Further reading * * Larry E.

The power of a military depends on its economic base and without this financial support, soldiers will not be paid, weapons and equipment cannot be manufactured and food cannot be bought. Hence, victory in war involves not only success on the battlefield but also the economic power and economic stability of a state. War finance covers a wide variety of financial measures including fiscal and monetary initiatives used in order to fund the costly expenditure of a war. Such measures can be broadly classified into three main categories: * levy of taxes - Taxation * raising of debts - Borrowing * creation of fresh money supply - Inflation Thus these measures may include levy of specific taxation, increase and enlarging the scope of existing taxation, raising of compulsory and voluntary loans from the public, arranging loans from foreign sovereign states or financial institutions, and also the creation of money by the government or the central banking authority. Throughout the history of human civilization, from ancient times until the modern era, conflicts and wars have always involved the raising of resources and war finance has since remained, in some form or the other, a major part of any defense economy plan. For example, economics played a key role in the Roman Empire. The brutal wars between the Roman empire and the Carthage proved to be very costly so much that Rome even ran out of money altogether at one stage. The Roman economy during this period were a pre- industrial economy which meant the majority of workers up to 80% of them were involved in the area of agriculture. Virtually all the taxes that would be collected by the government were spent on the military operations which turned out to be about also 80% of the entire budget in c. 150. Due to the huge financial burden that the maintenance of the military operations would have on the economy, techniques were thought up to help solve the burden. One such technique was the process of debasing the coinage. This was used in many countries that used coins from precious metals and they would debase the coins. This however didn't last very long as inflation started to increase. Various governments in charge attempted to curb the high cost of inflation through new reforms but some of their attempts just got steadily worse with the increasing bureaucracy that the government had to maintain as well as the huge amounts spent on welfare payments to the growing population worse. Loot and plunder - or at least the prospect of such - may play a role in war economies. Compare: This involves the taking of goods by force as part of a military or political victory and was used as a significant source of a revenue for the victorious state. During the first World War when the Germans occupied the Belgians, the Belgian factories were forced to produce goods for the German effort or dismantled their machinery and took it back to Germany ‚Äì along with thousands and thousands of Belgian slave factory workers. Taxation Taxation can be one of the more politically contentious ways to finance war. Raising taxes is often domestically unpopular, as people know that higher taxes reduce their individual abilities to invest and consume. As a consequence, raising taxes on a tax-averse population in order to fund a war might result in widespread anti-war sentiment. Moreover, taxes confiscate a part of the labor and the capital of the population. During World War 1, the United States and Great Britain financed approximately one quarter of their war costs via increased taxation, while in Austria the contribution of taxation towards the expenditure was zero. [3] The British government felt that they were an exception to this general rule and they saw their wealth and financial stability as one of their strongest warfighting assets. The income tax was therefore increased from 5.8% in 1913 to just over 30% in 5 years in 1918. The threshold was reduced in order for millions more people to be liable to pay the income tax. Borrowing For the government another possible solution to finance war was for the government to increase its debt. It could thus transfer the war costs to future generations. The government can issued bonds that are bought by creditors, usually the Central Banks. The sacrifices are as a result differed, the government would need in the future to pay it back with some interests. There are many examples in war history, referred to as War bond. The economic consequences of this method of finance is less direct for the population, but equally important. The interests paid can be seen as pure wealth redistribution. Moreover, an accumulation of debt, which is too important, can affect the economy of a country, through its ability of refunding its debt. It can alter the confidence of people in the country's economy. by H.A. Scott Trask in: MisesInstitute Austrian Economics, freedom, and peace, \\"War Finance : Theory and History\\" World War 1 War Bond Poster For the government another solution to finance war is for the government to increase its debt. When the Great War began, the majority of countries assumed that the war would be short especially in the eyes of the most powerful ally countries United States, Great Britain and France. They saw no need to raise taxes as it would have been politically difficult. It turned out however that it came at an extraordinary financial expense and as such thought it was best to pay for it by borrowing money and could thus transfer the war costs to future generations. The government can issue bonds that are bought by creditors, usually the Central Banks. The sacrifices are as a result differed, the government would need in the future to pay it back with some interests. There are many examples in war history, referred to as War bond. The economic consequences of this method of finance is less direct for the population, but equally important. The interests paid can be seen as pure wealth redistribution. Moreover, an accumulation of debt, which is too important, can affect the economy of a country, through its ability of refunding its debt. It can alter the confidence of people in the country's economy. The war bonds were debt securities that would be issued by the government to finance the military operations and defense mechanisms during the time of a war. In practice, war can be financed through the creation of a fresh money supply adding additional money to the financial system and the function of these bonds were to help to control the increase of inflation and to keep it stable. The United States government during World War 1 spent over $300 million which converts to over $4 billion in today's financial market. People would then buy these bonds which looked like stamps for 10 or 15 cents each from the government and the government promised to return them with an interest after a period of 10 years or more. During a war especially during World War 1, governments needed all the extra money they could get their hands on to help pay for the war equipment and supplies. The advertisement of these bonds were carried out through many media outlets and through propaganda materials on radio, cinema adverts and newspapers in order to convince the large multitude of the countries population. Inflation The government can also use a monetary tool to finance war, it could print more money in order to pay for troops, military complex and arms. But inflation is created, which reduces the purchasing power of people and can be thus seen as a form of taxation. However, it distributes the war costs in an arbitrary manner, especially on people with fixed incomes. At some point, such inflation could even reduce the production level of a country. During the great war, countries decided to turn on the printing presses with almost every country abandoning the gold standard in 1914 and started to inflate their individual currencies by printing more banknotes. E.g., in Britain money supplied was multiplied by almost 1151% and 1141% in Germany. Much of the extra money supply was absorbed by the war loans fortunate for the western countries while rationing out the controlled prices.  Borrowing vs. Taxing  When a conflict leads to higher governmental expenditures, the population financing the war is either paying directly (and immediately) or indirectly (and maybe delayed). Hence, war finance is can be divided into two categories: Direct or indirect financing. The former comprises taxes through which the population bears directly the burden, the latter includes borrowing or increasing the money supply. Empirical studies have established a connection between a leader's tax policy and subsequent punitive electoral consequences as they represent a permanent transfer of purchasing power by the taxpayer to the government. From a political perspective, borrowing is a more convenient way to finance wars because it can minimize the potential electoral consequences. Levying higher tax rates has an immediate effect on the population, whereas borrowing goes along with delayed repercussions. The advantage of borrowing is that it likely transfers the financial burden to a future government and consequently does not affect the current leader's prospects of a potential re-election. Second, borrowing itself is an accepted tool for the state to carry out its duties such as exerting expansive fiscal policies. That means because borrowing affects people only indirectly and is an accepted measure in general, it makes war a more diffuse target for critics, because it will be just one of the government's numerous debt sources. Of course, borrowing contributes to the increase of debt that causes also contentious debates. But particularly in the case of the United States, it can be observed that the hazard of a government shutdown is politically an undesirable outcome, even for the opposition. Having no alternatives, the Congress invariably passes legislation to increase the debt ceiling. This certainty guarantees that borrowing minimalizes any political costs. To conclude, wartime borrowing is politically advantageous relative to war taxation: It is just an - although often a significant one - additional source of debt, which blurs the traces of the initiator as the ultimate repayment takes place long after the leader who started the war has stepped down. These characteristics reduce the political costs for the current leader and causes borrowing to generally be more attractive and politically viable than introduction of war taxes. History of different perspectives on War finance in the US Financing a war requires the government to seek for additional revenue sources because government expenditures increase significantly during war or when a war is about to break out. The consequences of policies that focus to secure enough income sources have tremendous impact on the economy and often go even beyond the war itself. The determinants of how to provide financial funds are therefore driven by political interests giving different parties the opportunity to conceptualize and secure certain fiscal interests of their core constituencies. In the United States, the Republicans and their predecessors - the Whigs and Federalists - favoured to impose taxes, when the taxation was introduced as an ad valorem tariff or excise tax. These tax modes favoured manufacturing and business interests, the Republican base. The Democrats, however, traditionally tended to abstain from taxes because their support came from the South, a strong exporting region that would suffer from tariffs and excise taxes. With the constitutionality of income taxes in 1913, the Democrats advocated a progressive income tax due to the important role of labour in their political base. With the business sector being its main political base, the Republicans opposed higher income taxes, rather favouring less fiscal policy, including on war taxation. The high repercussions and redistribution effects of taxes lead to various political interests. Thus, different lobby groups formed trying to have determining influence on the tax mode, when political leaders tried to generate revenues from taxing or other alternatives.  Case Study: War costs of Afghanistan and Iraq  Not surprisingly, instrumental politicians tend to avoid war taxes, especially when the reasonableness of a war is publicly challenged or when the real cost of a war a difficult to calculate. This was also confirmed in the case of the Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003) war. Both wars were financed through heavy borrowing. In 2003, the Bush-Administration reckoning with a fast conquering expedition estimated the cost of the Iraq war at $50 billion to $60 billion. This turned out to be a severe miscalculation, when it became clear that the conquering of Iraq was much more complicated and that stability of Iraq required a long-term engagement of the US military. Three years later, in February 2006, a working paper authored by economists Linda Bilmes and Joseph Stiglitz already believed the true cost to be more than one trillion dollars, taking a conservative approach and supposing a troop withdrawal by 2010, not even including costs borne by other countries. A subsequent paper, published in March 2013, figured that the cost of the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts will be at least $4 trillion. However, taking into consideration macroeconomic costs such as higher oil prices would be likely to raise the cost to $5 or $6 trillion.

In Lebanon, KY 55 separates from US 68 and proceeds northward through Springfield in Washington County, Bloomfield in Nelson County, and Taylorsville and Elk Creek in Spencer County. In Shelby County it passes through Finchville and Shelbyville and continues north through Eminence in Henry County. Roughly three miles south of New Castle, KY 55 intersects U.S. Route 421. The two routes run concurrent for eight miles (13 km) before splitting near Campbellsburg. KY 55 continues north to Prestonville, where it ends at an intersection with U.S. Route 42 and Kentucky Route 36 on the bank of the Ohio River. Route description =Russell County through Taylor County= The route originates at a junction with U.S. Route 127 in the southern Russell County community of Freedom. The route continues into Adair County through Columbia. In the 2010s, KY 55 was rerouted onto the Columbia Bypass, while the original KY 55 alignment, which went through town and provided Cumberland Parkway access, was re-designated as KY 55 Business. The route continues northward, bypassing the Green River Lake State Park, and on to U.S. Route 68 in Campbellsville, Taylor County, where KY 55 joins US 68 east, and also runs concurrently with KY 70 for the remaining of that route's concurrency with US 68. US 68 and KY 55 continues north into Marion County. =Marion County through Spencer County= At Lebanon, KY 55 splits from US 68 and continues to Springfield, Washington County, running into downtown Springfield and crossing US 150. It continues north-northwestwardly into eastern Nelson County, providing access to the Bluegrass Parkway and US 62 at Bloomfield. KY 55 goes further north to Spencer County, and goes through Taylorsville. =Shelby County through Carroll County= From Spencer County, KY 55 runs northeast into Shelby County. The route runs through open fields with occasional houses lining the road. into Shelby County, KY 55 intersects with KY 148 and enters the community of Finchville. In Finchville the route is lined with houses and a few businesses, and the speed limited is reduced to 35 MPH. After meeting the eastern terminus of KY 1848, KY 55 leaves Finchville and heads north toward Shelbyville. In Shelbyville, KY 55 crosses Interstate 64 at Exit 32. Currently, KY 55 widens to 4 lanes with a center turning lane a few tenths of a mile north of the Interstate. However, construction is currently going on to widen the road to 4 lanes starting just south of the interstate as part of the I-64 widening project. North of I-64, many businesses line KY 55 as well as 3 industrial parks. north of the interstate, KY 55 intersects with US 60 / KY 55 Business and becomes the Shelbyville Bypass (Freedom's Way). The Shelbyville Bypass opened up in November 2010, and is a 4.5 mile 4-lane divided highway. The Shelbyville Bypass runs north then curves east, crossing KY 53 near Shelby County West Middle School. The route continues east, crossing over Clear Creek and ends north of Shelbyville at an intersection with KY 55 Business. North of the Shelbyville Bypass, KY 55 becomes Eminence Pike and narrows to two-lanes as it heads north passing open fields and houses before entering into Henry County roughly further north. In Henry County, KY 55 enters the city of Eminence and forms a concurrency with KY 22 for . It continues north out of town and forms a concurrency with US 421 north of KY 22. After passing by Henry County High School and traveling through New Castle, US 421 and KY 55 split in Campbellsburg. Roughly north of US 421, KY 55 passes over Interstate 71 and enters into Trimble County, where it travels for a short distance. The route intersects KY 316 at its eastern terminus and continues northward into Carroll County just over from the Trimble County-Henry County line. In Carroll County, KY 55 curves toward the northeast, passing KY 549 and KY 389 in rural sections of the county. After the intersection with KY 389, the route turns toward the northwest and travels along the Kentucky River on the east, with mainly woods on the west. As it nears Presntonville, KY 55 turns toward the west, then northeast, then north at New Castle Pike. In Prestonville, it passes by a few homes before it ends at an intersection with US 42/KY 36, just west of the Kentucky River and south of the Ohio River. The entire route remains two-lanes throughout Henry, Trimble, and Carroll counties.

Biography Born Charles Sylvan Atkinson, a native of Pratt City, Alabama, Cholly Atkins began dancing in the late 1930s before entering military service in 1942 during World War II. Upon leaving the U.S. Army. Atkins first found fame as one-half of Atkins & Coles, a top vaudeville dance act with partner Charles \\"Honi\\" Coles, debuting at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York. Atkins and Coles toured extensively nationally and internationally, performing in showcases with major jazz and swing bands, including those led by Louis Armstrong, Charlie Barnet, Count Basie, Cab Calloway, and Lionel Hampton. The pair also performed from 1949 to 1952 on Broadway in the stage production, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. In the mid-1950s, Cholly began teaching dance steps to the Cadillacs, Shirelles, Moonglows, Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers, Little Anthony & The Imperials, and other vocal groups. His dance steps were a new style coined \\"vocal choreography\\", as singers enhanced their vocal performances with stylish combinations of gestures and steps. After working as a freelance choreographer in 1962 for The Miracles, Atkins was hired by Berry Gordy to work as a Motown choreographer in 1964, and set about developing the routines that would later become the trademark moves of other Motown acts like The Supremes, The Temptations (Atkins was also featured in the video for their hit single \\"Lady Soul\\"), The Four Tops, The Marvelettes, Gladys Knight & The Pips and others. Atkins would, in fact, continue working with Motown artists well into the 1980s. He choreographed for non-Motown artists as well, namely the dance routines of The Cadillacs in the 1950s, and the Sylvers, as well as The O'Jays during the mid-1970s, appearing with them on an episode of Soul Train. He also worked with Detroit rock band DC Drive and is featured in the \\"You Need Love\\" video. In 1989, Atkins received a Tony Award for choreographing the Broadway show Black and Blue. He also accepted a 1993 National Endowment for the Arts three-year fellowship to tour colleges and universities teaching vocal choreography. He continued to teach dance in Las Vegas until February 2003.  Death  Diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in March 2003, Atkins died of the cancer several weeks later on April 19, 2003 in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was five months short of his 90th birthday.  Family  Marriages * Atkins married Catherine Gayle Williams (maiden; born 1914) November 27, 1936, in Los Angeles. They were divorced in 1944. She had been a dancer at the chorus line of Cotton Club productions.

It was founded in 1825 by members of the German Reformed Church in the United States to provide theological education for prospective clergy and other church leaders. History After a failed attempt to open the school in Frederick, MD and another in Harrisburg, PA, the school opened in Carlisle, Pennsylvania on the campus of Dickinson College on March 11, 1825 with a class of five students. Later lectures were held in the \\"old Reformed Church of Carlisle.\\" At this time the seminary struggled financially and due to the fund raising campaign of James Ross Reily (1788‚Äì1884) the seminary was able to relocate to York in 1829. Here attendance averaged between 12-25 students. In 1836/7 the seminary moved again to Mercersburg, Pennsylvania under the charter of Marshall College. Here the work of such celebrated professors as John Williamson Nevin, Friederich Augustus Rauch, and Philip Schaff gave rise to the \\"Mercersburg Theology,\\" noted for its historic concerns for worship, sacraments, and Church in its ecumenical expressions. In 1853 Marshall College moved to Lancaster, PA, consolidating with Franklin College to form Franklin and Marshall College. In 1871, the seminary moved to the campus of Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster. While viewed as a temporary arrangement, the present site of the seminary was not purchased until 1893. The buildings were completed and occupied in 1894. For most of its history (109 of its 168 years), LTS was the sole seminary of the Reformed Church in the United States (German Reformed Church). With the formation of the Evangelical and Reformed Church in 1934, the seminary became one of three seminaries serving that newly united denomination. LTS is currently one of seven seminaries holding full relationship with the UCC, a denomination formed in 1957 by the union of the E&R; Church and most of the Congregational Christian Churches.

Due to a lack of reliable source material, it is difficult to separate the legends concerning Emese from her actual role as a historical person. Emese is also a feminine Hungarian name. The word originates from the Old Turkic eme, ana or ene, which mean mother.T√ºrk Mitolojisi Ansiklopedik S√∂zl√ºk, Celal Beydili, Yurt Yayƒ±nevi, 608‚Äì610. old. Emese in legend Emese's Dream, the legend concerning the conception of Prince √Ålmos, is one of the earliest known tales from Hungarian history. The legend can be tentatively dated to around 860-870, and with certainty to between 820 and 997 (the birth of √Ålmos and the acceptance of Christianity). In the legend, Emese, the wife of Chief √ñgyek (√úgek), was impregnated by a turul bird. The turul appeared to her in a dream and told her that from her womb a great river would begin, and flow out over strange lands. According to dream interpreters, this meant that she would give birth to a son who would lead his people out of their home in Levedia, and that her descendants would be glorious kings. Emese's son was named √Ålmos; his name derives from the Hungarian word √°lom, meaning dream, thus \\"√Ålmos\\" can be interpreted as \\"the Dreamt One\\". The legend has several variants, namely regarding whether Emese was impregnated by the turul bird or whether she was already pregnant at the time of her dream,Gyula Krist√≥, editor. Korai Magyar T√∂rt√©neti Lexikon. (9-14. sz√°zad) (Encyclopedia of the Early Hungarian History - 9-14th centuries). Budapest: Akad√©miai Kiad√≥, 1994. p. 39. and whether the bird appeared to her literally or in a dream while she was asleep. Some variations of the legend may have been introduced in the 19th century during the reemergence of Hungarian nationalism at that time.\\"Feminism, the Murderer of Mothers\\" by Eva V. Huseby-Darvas, in Women out of place: the gender of agency and the race of nationality. Brackett F. Williams, (editor) New York: Routeledge, 1996. pp. 161‚Äì185. Emese in written sources Emese is mentioned in two historical works: the Gesta Hungarorum and the Chronicon Pictum. Neither are contemporary sources, as both were written several centuries after her death (the Gesta around 1200 and the Chronicon Pictum in the 14th century). Both works freely intermingle actual historical events with legend and chivalric tales, so it is impossible to know if Emese is mentioned as legend or as an actual historical personage. In the Gesta Hungarorum (\\"The Deeds of the Hungarians\\"), the anonymous author writes \\"In the year of the Lord 819 √úgek, noble Lord of Scythia descending from the great house of Magog, took in marriage the daughter of Eunedubelia of Dentumoger, Emesu. From her a son was born and given the name Almus. The child was given this divine name for when his mother was pregnant with him there appeared to her a in a dream a bird, and instantly it seemed to her that from her womb a spring began and from her loins spread a great line of kings but they did not propagate in their own lands.\\" The Chronicon Pictum contains the text \\"Eleud, the son of Ugek by the daughter of Eunodbilia in Scythia had a son, who was named Almus because in a dream of his mother there appeared a bird in the shape of a hawk who impregnated her, and from her womb a fast-flowing stream began to flow, but it was in foreign lands that it grew and propagated.

Its body was made by the Italian design studio Ghia, and Chrysler completed its assembly in Detroit. The Chrysler turbine engine program that produced the Turbine Car began during the late 1930s, and created multiple prototypes that successfully completed numerous long-distance trips in the 1950s and early 1960s. The A-831 engines that powered the Ghia-designed Turbine Car could operate on many different fuels, required less maintenance, and lasted longer than conventional piston engines, although they were much more expensive to produce. A total of 55 cars were built: five prototypes and a limited run of 50 cars for a public user program. The car's design was created by Elwood Engel and the Chrysler studios. A two-door hardtop coupe, it featured power brakes, power steering, and a TorqueFlite transmission, and was coated with a metallic, root beer- colored paint known as \\"turbine bronze\\". After testing, Chrysler conducted a user program from October 1963 to January 1966 that involved 203 individual drivers in 133 different cities across the United States cumulatively driving more than one million miles (1.6 million km). The program helped the company determine a variety of problems with the cars, notably with their complicated starting procedure, relatively unimpressive acceleration, and sub-par fuel economy and noise level. The experience also revealed key advantages of the turbine engines, including their remarkable durability, smooth operation, and relatively modest maintenance requirements. After the conclusion of the user program in 1966, Chrysler reclaimed all of the cars and destroyed all but nine of them; Chrysler kept two cars, five are displayed at museums in the United States, and two are in private collections. Chrysler's turbine engine program ultimately ended in 1979, largely due to the failure of the engines to meet government emissions regulations, relatively poor fuel economy, and as a prerequisite of receiving a government loan in 1979. Background Chrysler began researching turbine engines for aviation applications during the late 1930s, led primarily by executive engineer George Huebner. After World War II, Huebner was part of a group of engineers who began exploring the idea of powering a car with a turbine. Other members of the secretive Chrysler research team which worked on automotive turbines included fellow engineers Bud Mann and Sam B. Williams. The concept intrigued them, largely because turbine engines have fewer moving parts than their piston-powered counterparts and can run on a variety of fuels. According to historian Charles K. Hyde, by the mid-1950s Chrysler \\"led the way in terms of gas turbine research\\" (although General Motors and Rover also built operational turbine cars after World War II). After improving their turbine design, most notably by engineering a regenerator to resolve an issue with heat exchange, the Chrysler team's efforts reached early maturity when they mated a turbine to an otherwise-stock 1954 Plymouth Belvedere. Heating and cooling and emissions and exhaust were among the principal engineering challenges which faced the turbine engine. Chrysler tested the Belvedere, claiming that its turbine engine contained 20 percent fewer parts and weighed less than comparable, conventional piston engines. On June 16, 1954, the company publicly unveiled the turbine-powered Belvedere at its Chelsea Proving Grounds in Chelsea, Michigan, in front of over 500 reporters. Chrysler unveiled its next turbine car, a 1956 Plymouth, on March 23, 1956; Huebner drove it on a four-day trip from New York City to Los Angeles. Although the car was shadowed by a 14-person convoy of mechanics with fuel and spare parts, it only required two minor repairs on the trip (neither of which were engine-related). The coast- to-coast journey's success led Chrysler to double the size of its turbine program and move it from Highland Park, Michigan, to a larger facility on Greenfield Road in Detroit. The program began generating a number of patent applications in 1957, due largely to the contributions of metallurgist Amedee Roy and engineer Giovanni Savonuzzi. The next iteration of the Chrysler turbine engine (the second-generation engine) was placed into a 1959 Plymouth, which averaged on a trip from Detroit to Woodbridge, New Jersey. This mileage was substantially higher than the achieved with the first-generation turbine on the 1956 New York-to-Los Angeles journey. After Chrysler named former accountant Lynn Townsend its new president in 1961, the company unveiled its next, third-generation turbine engine on February 28; the CR2A was the first Chrysler turbine engine to be officially named. Unlike its more-experimental predecessors, the CR2A was designed with an eye on costs and production methods. While the engine was under development in May 1960, Huebner said that it would serve as its own torque converter, generate , have an acceleration lag of 1.5 seconds (compared with nine seconds for its predecessor), and weigh ‚Äî less than a comparably sized piston engine. Third-generation turbines were mated to a variety of vehicles, including a 2.5-ton 1960 Dodge truck and the Chrysler Turboflite concept car. Refined CR2A turbines were installed into a 1962 Dodge Dart and Plymouth Fury; the Dart was driven from New York City to Los Angeles in December 1961, and the Fury completed a journey from Los Angeles to San Francisco in January 1962. After Huebner arrived in Los Angeles with the Dart, he spent two hours giving journalists rides in the turbine- powered car. Chrysler had barnstormed its fleet of turbine cars to dealers across North America, Europe and Mexico by February 1962, visiting 90 cities, giving rides to almost 14,000 people, and being seen by millions more. The third-generation turbine program ended at the 1962 Chicago Auto Show that month, where the company displayed its turbine-powered fleet. Shortly before the show Chrysler announced an upcoming fourth-generation turbine engine it planned to install in a limited run of 50‚Äì75 cars which would be loaned to the public at no cost in late 1963, a decision largely due to enthusiastic public response to the barnstorming tour. Engine Exploded view of the A-831 turbine engine at the Walter P. Chrysler Museum The Chrysler Turbine Car is powered by the A-831, Chrysler's fourth-generation turbine engine. The most notable difference from its predecessor, the CR2A, was its use of twin regenerators (one mounted on either side of the gasifier) instead of a single top cover-mounted heat exchanger. This design helped the A-831 trim from the CR2A's weight, reducing it to a relatively-light . Huebner described the turbine as similar to a jet engine, noting that it had only one spark plug and about 80 percent fewer parts than a typical automotive piston engine. Due to their construction, the engines did not require antifreeze, a cooling system, a radiator, connecting rods, or crankshafts. The A-831 could operate on diesel fuel, unleaded gasoline, kerosene, and JP-4 jet fuel; leaded gasoline damaged it. According to Chrysler, it could burn a variety of unusual fuels ranging from furnace oil and perfume to peanut and soybean oils. Mexican president Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos ran one of the cars on tequila after Chrysler engineers confirmed that it would do so. The engine produced at 36,000 revolutions per minute (rpm), of torque, and idled between 18,000 and 22,000 rpm. At idle, its exhaust did not exceed . When driven at , the turbine ran at its maximum of 60,000 rpm. The A-831's compressor had a pressure ratio of 4:1 and an efficiency of 80 percent; its combustor operated at 95 percent efficiency. Compared to conventional piston engines, turbine engines generally require less maintenance, last longer, and start more easily in cold conditions; the A-831 started properly at temperatures as low as . The first car to receive an A-831 was a Plymouth Fury. In this Ghia-built turbine car, the engine had a 0-to- time of about 12 seconds. Due to the exotic materials and strict tolerances needed to build the engines and the investment casting method with which they were made, the A-831s were very expensive to produce; Chrysler never disclosed their actual cost. Design The Turbine Car was designed in the Chrysler studios under the direction of Elwood Engel, who had worked for the Ford Motor Company before moving to Chrysler. Due to its resemblance to the Engel-designed Ford Thunderbird, the car is occasionally called the \\"Englebird\\". According to Huebner, the design was intended to compete with the Chevrolet Corvette in addition to the Thunderbird. The car's bodies were handmade by Italian design studio Ghia, which had built a number of concept cars for Chrysler (including an Imperial limousine and the Norseman). The mostly completed Turbine Car bodies, which were assembled, painted, trimmed, and upholstered by Ghia in Italy, were shipped to Chrysler's Greenfield Road turbine facility in Detroit for final assembly; this consisted of installing the turbine engines, TorqueFlite transmissions, electrical wiring, and components such as radios and heaters. Building an individual car may have cost as much as between $50,000 to $55,000 ( to ); Virgil Exner, Jr., estimates that the bodies themselves cost about $20,000 (), although Chrysler never revealed the cost of each turbine engine. The first five cars were completed in early 1962 as prototypes used for troubleshooting; each was slightly different from the others, varying in exterior color, interior upholstery, and roof material. Early problems discovered from the prototypes included sluggish acceleration (attributed in part to the relatively heavy hand-built bodies) and vibration, ultimately determined to be caused by the tire treads and noticeable due to the unusual smoothness of the turbine engine. A total of 50 identical Turbine Cars were built between October 1963 and October 1964. They were all two-door hardtop coupes, with air-over-oil power brakes and power steering. The cars had independent front suspension with a coil spring at each front wheel, eschewing Chrysler's contemporary- standard independent front longitudinal torsion bar system (although their rear suspension utilized off-the-shelf leaf springs). All four wheels were equipped with power-assisted drum brakes. The Turbine Car interior The car body is finished in a metallic, root beer-colored paint known as \\"turbine bronze\\". Its headlights, deeply-recessed taillights, turn signals, and pod- shaped backup lights are mounted in chrome bezels. The turbine-inspired style carries through to the center console design of the interior, which has bronze-colored leather upholstery, deep-pile bronze carpet, and brushed aluminum accents. The cars have black vinyl hardtop roofs, leather-upholstered bucket seats, and whitewall tires. The Turbine Car's dashboard is dominated by three large gauges: a speedometer, a tachometer, and pyrometer, the latter monitoring the temperature of the turbine inlet (the engine's hottest component). Its appearance is mostly stock, although the tachometer and pyrometer display abnormally high readings compared to piston-engine cars: 46,000 rpm and , respectively. All 55 turbine cars had identical ignition keys. User program Chrysler Turbine Car at the 1964 New York World's Fair Two of the cars gave rides to visitors at the 1964 New York World's Fair, and another went on a worldwide tour; 50 were lent to the general public as part of a user program. The cars were given to drivers for a three-month period at no charge, aside from fuel costs; participants also gave Chrysler in-depth interviews within two weeks of returning their cars. During the user program, which ran from October 1963 to January 1966, the cars' operational downtime was reduced from four percent early on to one percent by its conclusion. The user program helped identify a variety of problems with the cars, including starter malfunction at high altitudes, difficulty in mastering the unusual eight-step starting procedure (which, for some users, resulted in engine damage), and the cars' relatively unimpressive acceleration. Nonetheless, the turbine engines were remarkably durable in comparison to contemporary piston engines. The most-cited advantages of the turbine engine, according to the participants' interviews, were its smooth and vibration-free operation, reduced maintenance requirements, and ease of starting in different conditions; the most-common complaints concerned its slow acceleration, sub- par fuel economy, and relatively high noise level. Investigating the latter complaint, Chrysler found that the distinctive sound of the car's turbine (reminiscent of a jet engine) was positively received by about 60 percent of those involved in the user program and disliked by about 20 percent of their fellow users. The cars had conspicuous warning labels cautioning drivers to avoid using leaded gasoline; although the turbine engine could run on it, the lead additive left debilitating deposits in it. The only fuel which Chrysler recommended not be used, it was by far the easiest to obtain during the user program. Fuels commonly used by those participating in the user program included diesel and home heating oil. More than 1 million miles (1.6 million km) were accumulated in testing by the 50 cars given to the public, which were driven by 203 users before the program ended in January 1966. The users lived in 133 cities in the 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C.; 180 were male and 23 were female, their ages ranged from 21 to 70, and 60 percent were Chrysler owners. Legacy Chrysler Turbine Car at the 1999 Antique Automobile Club of America show in Hershey, Pennsylvania Chrysler Turbine Car at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles Still of a turbine car in the 1964 film The Lively Set In April 1966, product planning and development vice president Harry E. Chesebrough noted that the 50 test cars would be taken off the road regardless of whether the Chrysler Turbine Car went into production. Chrysler destroyed 46 of the cars after it finished the user program and other public displays. Forty-five of the cars were burned and crushed at a scrapyard south of Detroit, and the other was destroyed at Chrysler's Chelsea Proving Grounds. A widely circulated explanation was that the cars were destroyed to avoid a substantial tariff on the imported Ghia bodies, although author Steve Lehto claims that this has been \\"largely discredited.\\" The destruction of the cars was in line with the automobile industry's practice of not selling non- production or prototype cars to the public. According to Lehto, the decision was influenced by Chrysler's public relations concerns: the potential difficulty of keeping the cars running and fears that owners would replace the turbine powerplants with piston engines. A Chrysler executive was quoted in Look: \\"Our main objective is research, and we did not want turbines turning up on used-car lots.\\" A similar practice was later used by General Motors with its EV1 when it terminated the program and destroyed most of the cars in 2003. Chrysler's development of turbine engines continued from the late 1960s into the 1970s, resulting in the creation of fifth- and sixth-generation engines. The turbines ultimately failed to meet government emissions regulations and had relatively poor fuel economy, despite promising early results and a $6.4 million contract from the Environmental Protection Agency. According to Charles K. Hyde, the company's effort to enlarge and diversify its turbine program was unsuccessful and spread its \\"already-thin executive talent pool even thinner\\". An October 1967 Department of Commerce report concluded that the turbine engine was \\"unsuited to automobiles\\". Development continued on automotive turbines, in part because turbine exhaust contains fewer unburned hydrocarbons and lower concentrations of other pollutants. In March 1971, the Williams Research Corporation continued developing a turbine engine with funding from the National Air Pollution Control Administration. Chrysler's turbine engine development continued through the mid-1970s, with later compact versions of the engines being installed in the Dodge Aspen. However, the program as well as the seventh-generation engine were discontinued in 1979 as a requirement of the Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979, as well as due to its inability to attain enough fuel economy. One Chrysler Turbine Car appeared in the 1964 film The Lively Set, painted white with blue racing stripes; it was the only Turbine Car not painted bronze. Only nine Chrysler Turbine Cars have survived. Two are kept by Chrysler, out of three initially retained by the company; five are on display at museums around the United States, and two were acquired by private collectors. Chrysler has displayed one of its cars at the Walter P. Chrysler Museum in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The five cars on museum display were donated to the Detroit Historical Museum, the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, the Museum of Transportation in Kirkwood, Missouri, the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. In 2005, the Detroit Historical Museum lent its car, which had been in warehouse storage, to the Gilmore Car Museum in Hickory Corners, Michigan. All the cars donated to museums had their fan assemblies removed to render their engines inoperable, although the car owned by the Museum of Transportation was restored and returned to operating condition in the 1980s, allowing it to appear at car shows. Two Chrysler Turbine Cars have been acquired by private collectors. One is owned by Frank Kleptz of Fort Wayne, Indiana which was originally donated to the former Harrah Collection in Reno, Nevada, before being purchased by Domino's Pizza founder Tom Monaghan and sold to Kleptz. The second is owned by comedian and television host Jay Leno who purchased one of the three Turbine Cars originally retained by Chrysler in 2009. Leno's car was featured in the BBC television show James May's Cars of the People. Both privately owned Chrysler Turbine Cars are operational. =Locations of surviving cars= Chrysler Turbine Car at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan * #991211: Museum of Transportation, Kirkwood, Missouri * #991225: Detroit Historical Museum, Detroit, Michigan * #991230: Walter P.

He created the French ski resort of Courchevel located in the Trois Vall√©es and in doing so practically wrote the rule book on how to design a ski resort. Chappis was a keen ski tourer exploring the mountains around Grenoble in the 1930s before joining the army and serving in the early stages of World War II. A decorated war hero he was captured in an attack on a German position in the final days before the French surrender and served five years in a PoW camp in Austria. He completed his doctorate in captivity, the subject was the development of a ski resort in the Trois Vall√©es area. His ideas were often controversial, especially with developers more concerned with profits than aesthetics. This led him to be nicknamed the Anarchitecte. In the 1960s he was appointed as a United Nations expert on mountain development. A nomination that came not from his native France but from Italy. Chappis is also credited along with the architect Denis Pradelle with creating a modern, functional style of mountain architecture which rejected both traditional Savoie styles and the Tyrolean chalet style of architecture. Works Laurent Chappis worked on studies in many countries including France, Italy, Argentina, Morocco, Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, his most notable works are: * Courchevel * Chamrousse - Le village d'enfants de Bachaboulou * San Sicario - Clos de la Chapelle References * l'Anarchitecte, Philippe R√©vil * History of Courchevel * Philippe R√©vil, Rapha√´l Helle, Les pionniers de l'or blanc, (2004), page 84, Category:1915 births Category:2013 deaths Category:People from Aix-les-Bains Category:People from Savoy Category:20th-century French architects Category:French military personnel of World War II Category:World War II prisoners of war held by Germany Category:French prisoners of war in World War II ","title":"Laurent Chappis"},{"id":"2512752","text":"≈ò in upper- and lowercase The grapheme ≈ò, ≈ô (R with h√°ƒçek, example of Czech pronunciation: ) is a letter used in alphabets of the Czech and Upper Sorbian languages.

The second theory posits that ≈ô evolved from the phoneme r followed by the Proto-Slavic vowel yer (—å). Finally, it is possible that the phoneme evolved from the Proto-Slavic combination of r and the nasal ƒô, or from the cluster rj (alternatively spelled r').

Coherence in statistics is an indication of the quality of the information, either within a single data set, or between similar but not identical data sets.

In personal probability When dealing with personal probability assessments, or supposed probabilities derived in nonstandard ways, it is a property of self-consistency across a whole set of such assessments. =In gambling strategy= One way of expressing such self- consistency is in terms of responses to various betting propositions, as described in relation to coherence (philosophical gambling strategy).Dodge, Y.

The slightly reticent Boyle was chosen as captain for the 1880 tour but a shipboard team meeting voted to replace him with the more outgoing Billy Murdoch before their arrival. An outstanding medium-pacer, Boyle's greatest strengths were said to be the accuracy of his deliveries and his ability to probe a batsman's weaknesses. His bowling was considered to be particularly effective under English conditions. His achievements with the ball were often overshadowed by the exploits of his brilliant team mate, \\"The Demon Bowler\\", Fred Spofforth. He was an exceptionally good close-in fielder, too, and a brave if limited batsman. In all, he played 12 Tests, taking 32 wickets at an average 20.03.

He studied at the department of economics at University of Tokyo and worked his way through school through various jobs, including singing at a cabaret. Upon graduation in 1960, he entered Sumitomo Seika, and joined the National Police Agency in 1962. In 1972, he took charge of a number of high-profile cases, including the Red Army Asama-Sanso incident, the Narita Airport incident, and the Tel Aviv highjacking. Kamei is one of the few major politicians to oppose the death penalty, and wrote a book, Shikei Haishi ron, asserting his opposition. Political career In 1977, he left the agency and received 3.5 million yen in severance pay, which he used to run for the Diet in Hiroshima. He was elected in 1979 as a member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). In 1989, he formed the Freedom Reform Alliance, criticizing the LDP's system of factions and strongly supported Shintar≈ç Ishihara. He became Minister of Transport in 1994 and Minister of Construction in 1996. In 1998, he left the Mitsuzuka faction and formed the \\"Nakayama-Kamei group\\" with Minister of Foreign Affairs Taro Nakayama. In 1999, he headed up the LDP's Policy Research Council and founded the Kamei faction. In 2003, he unsuccessfully ran for the position of Prime Minister against the incumbent, Junichiro Koizumi.

According to Abelard, \\"Jesus died as the demonstration of God's love,\\" a demonstration which can change the hearts and minds of the sinners, turning back to God. Doctrine =Abelard= It was not until Anselm, with his satisfaction theory of atonement, that a theory of atonement was specifically articulated. The moral influence theory was developed, or most notably propagated, by Abelard (1079-1142), as an alternative to Anselm's satisfaction theory. Abelard not only \\"rejected the idea of Jesus' death as a ransom paid to the devil,\\" which turned the Devil into a rival god, but also objected to the idea that Jesus' death was a \\"debt paid to God's honor.\\" He also objected to the emphasis on God's judgment, and the idea that God changed his mind after the sinner accepted Jesus' sacrificial death, which was not easily reconcilable with the idea of \\"the perfect, impassible God [who] does not change.\\" Abelard focussed on changing man's perception of God as not offended, harsh, and judgemental, but as loving. According to Abelard, \\"Jesus died as the demonstration of God's love,\\" a demonstration which can change the hearts and minds of the sinners, turning back to God. Beilby and Eddy note that Abelard was \\"challenged in his views by Bernard of Clairvaux, condemned by the Council of Sens (1140), and eventually excommunicated. His general approach to the atonement, however, has lived on in various forms throughout the last millennium.\\" = Moral example theory = A related theory, the \\"moral example theory,\\" was developed by Faustus Socinus (1539-1604) in his work De Jesu Christo servatore (1578). He rejected the idea of \\"vicarious satisfaction.\\" According to Socinus, Jesus' death offers us a perfect example of self- sacrificial dedication to God.\\" A number of theologians see \\"example\\" (or \\"exemplar\\") theories of the atonement as variations of the moral influence theory. Wayne Grudem, however, argues that \\"Whereas the moral influence theory says that Christ's death teaches us how much God loves us, the example theory says that Christ's death teaches us how we should live.\\" Grudem identifies the Socinians as supporters of the example theory. Influence on Reformation thought During the Protestant Reformation in Western Christianity, the majority of the Reformers strongly rejected the moral influence view of the atonement in favour of penal substitution, a highly forensic modification of the honor-oriented Anselmian satisfaction model. Fausto Sozzini's Socinian arm of the Reformation maintained a belief in the moral influence view of the atonement. Socinianism was an early form of Unitarianism, and the Unitarian Church today maintains a moral influence view of the atonement, as do many liberal Protestant theologians of the modern age. During the 18th century, versions of the moral influence view found overwhelming support among German theologians, most notably the Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant.Alister McGrath, 'The Moral Theory of the Atonement: An Historical and Theological Critique' in Scottish Journal of Theology, 38, pp 205-220. In the 19th and 20th century, it has been popular among liberal Protestant thinkers in the Anglican, Methodist, Lutheran and Presbyterian churches, including the Anglican theologian Hastings Rashdall. A number of English theological works in the last hundred years have advocated and popularised the moral influence theory of atonement.Hastings Rashdall, The Idea of Atonement in Christian Theology (London: Macmillan, 1919).David A.

A strong division has remained since the Reformation between liberal Protestants (who typically adopt a moral influence view) and conservative Protestants (who typically adopt the penal substitution theory). Both sides tend to believe that their position is taught by the Bible.

In Wix√°rika cosmology, the world was believed to have been created in Wirikuta. Wirikuta is the focus of a yearly pilgrimage in which community members, led by maraka'ames (shamans), travel approximately 250 miles (400 kilometers) from Jalisco to San Luis Potos√≠. The area in which the pilgrimage occurs is protected as a UNESCO Natural Sacred Area, but is at risk for exploitation and environmental damage by the foreign mining company First Majestic Silver.  Sacred places  The sun made its first appearance in Wirikuta, and it is the sacred land of the Wix√°rikas (Huichol's) deified ancestors. They have sacred places on each one of the cardinal directions and the center. * Teakata (Santa Catarina, Jalisco), Center * Huaxamanaka (Cerro Gordo, Durango), North * Haramara (San Blas, Nayarit), West * Xapawleyeta (Isla de los Alacranes del Lago Chapala, Jalisco), South. * Wirikuta, East. Huichols carry out yearly pilgrimages to Wirikuta or Huiricuta. Between October and March, they follow the journey of their deities from Haramara's sea to the place where the Sun appeared (Reunax), the Cerro Quemado (Leunax√º). Those Gods were guided by Tatewari, the Grandfather Fire. There, a Deer (maxa) used his horns to rise the sun to the sky, illuminating the world.  Pilgrimage  In order to follow the sacred journey, every year the maraka'ames (shamans) travel 250 miles (400 kilometers) from Wixarica's area in Jalisco to San Luis Potos√≠. At the beginning they walk towards Takata, a sacred area in Sierra Madre Occidental where the temple guard (xuxuricare) will ask for a safe journey. The next step is kalihuey, a Main Temple where they join Wixarica's authorities. They collect peyote - a cactus containing hallucinogens - along the way, they believe the peyote enables the Wixarica (Huichol) to commune directly with their ancestors and deities. At the end they collect hikuri and take it back to their homes, recreating life's cycle. Groups travel under the direction of a leading shaman, but may include other shamans who assist on the journey, apprentice shamans, and family groups which may include children. The lead shaman advises participants on their ingestion of peyote and other behavior. Abstinence and purification are important parts of the journey. Participants abstain from sex, and abstain from or limit food, water, and sleep. Early in the journey, participants undergo a rite of public confession and purification, to prepare themselves for further healing and growth as they travel. This includes a retelling of each person's transgressions in front of the group. The most significant transgressions are those of theft, murder and adultery. Confession therefore includes the public recitation of a full personal sexual history. The intention is to create an experience of cleansing and renewal, free of jealousy, shame or blame. A fire invokes Tatehuari while a Maraka'me hits each speaker's legs with a stick so that they may remember correctly and not omit any occurrence.  Proposed mining  The Wirikuta, a sacred place for the Huichol peoples, is being threatened by the Canadian mining company First Majestic Silver, which has obtained permission from the Mexican government for its proposed La Luz Silver Project for the extraction of silver in the Sierra Decatorce, even though it is transgressing the law in covenants that protect the area Wirikuta and the Wixarika peoples at national and international levels. The La Luz Silver Project is 100% owned by First Majestic Silver Corp. The property was acquired in 2009 as a result of the acquisition of Normabec Mining Resources. The site consists of mining concessions that cover 6,327 hectares and is located within Real de Catorce, a historically significant mining district with an estimated historic production of 230 million ounces of recovered silver between 1773 and 1990. The La Luz Silver Project is located in the northern portion of San Lu√≠s Potos√≠ State, Mexico. The property is approximately 25 km west of the town of Matehuala and 170 km due north of the city of San Lu√≠s Potos√≠, the state capital. The mining site represents a threat to the environment balance and health of the population in the area. It is adding greater social impacts through the division of local peoples. Chemical substances used in the mining process from previous mines are destroying resources at various levels, which are creating impact on the environment and human health. For example, the mining sites will consume vast quantities of water in an already arid region.  Flora and Fauna  Wirikuta is home to 223 animal species of which 53 are mammals, 141 are birds, 32 are reptiles and 7 are amphibious. The 141 birds registered in Wirikuta represent 15% of Mexico's birds. Some of the fauna of Wirikuta includes: *Cynomys mexicanus or Mexican prairie dog *Vulpes macrotis or Northern desertic fox *Taxidea taxus or giant badger *Choeronycteris mexicana *Leptonycteris curasoae *Leptonycteris nivalis *Spizella wortheni *Aquila chrysaetos *Falco mexicanus or Mexican hawk *Asio flammeus *Parabuteo unicinctus *Cophosaurus texanus *Crotaphytus collaris *Thamnophis cyrtopsis *Phrynosoma orbiculare *Kinosternon integrum or mud turtle In Wirikuta there are 567 registered plant species. Most of the cactaceaes of Wirikuta are on the list of Mexican endangered species (Norma Oficial Mexicana de Plantas Amenazadas y en Peligro de Extinci√≥n). A big portion of its flora and fauna is endemic, meaning it can only be found there. These are some of the flora of Wirikuta: *Lophophora williamsii or peyote *Ariocarpus retusus *Manfreda brunnea *Sagittaria macrophylla *Pinus culminicola *Pinus nelsoni *Pinus pinceana *Echinocactus *Larrea tridentata *Agave lechuguilla *Yucca *Mezquite *Brahea berlandier *Sedum catorce *Astrophytum myriostigma *Lophophora alberto-vojtechii *Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus *Pelecyphora strobiliformis *Cactaceae - there's 73 species *Opuntia - there's 300 species *Echeveria sp. - there's 393 species  References  External links *Art at ISI *Erowid Experience Vaults Category:Huichol Category:Religion in Mexico Category:Religious places of the indigenous peoples of North America Category:World Heritage Sites in Danger ","title":"Wirikuta"},{"id":"2512811","text":"Graeme \\"Foxy\\" Fowler (born 20 April 1957) is an English former professional cricketer and cricket coach, who played for Lancashire County Cricket Club, England, and later for Durham. He appeared in 21 Test matches and 26 One Day International (ODIs) for England, averaging 35.32 in his Test batting career. After his playing career he founded the centre of excellence scheme at Durham MCCU based at Durham University in 1996, the success of which led the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to establish five more centres; Fowler stepped down as head coach in 2015, after changes in the scheme. The cricket writer Colin Bateman noted: \\"a risk-taking left-hander, Fowler rarely bored anyone with his batting\\". Lancashire and England career Fowler was born in Accrington, Lancashire. Educated at Accrington Grammar School and Durham University, Fowler made his debut in first-class cricket in 1979. He usually opened the batting for both county and country, and his most successful opening partnership was with Gehan Mendis between 1986 and 1993. He made his Test debut in 1982, when sixteen England players were banned for three years for participating in the rebel tour of South Africa during the apartheid era. His highest Test score was 201, made in a nine-hour innings in Madras (now Chennai); this was the first double century by an English cricketer in India. Mike Gatting also scored a double century in the same innings, the first time that two English batsmen had made double centuries in the same Test innings. However, he lost his place in the England team when the rebel tourists were reinstated, and he had neck trouble. He was not re-selected in Tests for the remainder of his career. Against New Zealand at The Oval in 1983, Fowler scored his first Test hundred (105 off 303 balls), as Chris Tavare and he became the first England openers to score a century in the same Test innings for twenty three years.Cricinfo ‚Äì The real deal.

Content-usa.cricinfo.com. Retrieved 26 August 2011. He is the only batsman to score two complete hundreds in a match with the aid of a runner. Playing for Lancashire at Southport in 1982, he strained his thigh while fielding on the first day during Warwickshire's innings of 523‚Äì4 declared, but batted without a runner to score 26 not out at stumps. He then scored exactly 100 before lunch on the second day with David Lloyd as his runner. In the second innings, Ian Folley ran for him (and acknowledged the crowd's applause for the century) when Fowler scored 128 not out on the third day. In 1987, Fowler scored an unbeaten century in a Sunday League match against Somerset, despite an injury which forced him to bat with a runner.1987 Lancashire v Somerset - Old Trafford , Matt Proctor, Old Trafford Cricket Ground, Manchester].

Subsequently, he was posted as Station Commander at RAF Tangmere, and in early 1956 accepted his final posting to RAF Newton as Station Commander.Gray 2006, p. 152. On 1 December 1956, Kent retired from the RAF with the rank of group captain.Kent 2008, p. 235. He joined Kelvin-Hughes Aviation Limited as sales manager. His first marriage in 1939 was dissolved and he remarried in 1948. His family with a son and two daughters lived at Hartley Wintney, Hants. Kent died on 7 October 1985 in Woking, Surrey at the age of 71 years. Quotes \\"I cannot say how proud I am to have been privileged to help form and lead No. 303 squadron and later to lead such a magnificent fighting force as the Polish Wing. There formed within me in those days an admiration, respect and genuine affection for these really remarkable men which I have never lost. I formed friendship that are as firm as they were those twenty-five years ago and this I find most gratifying. We who were privileged to fly and fight with them will never forget and Britain must never forget how much she owes to the loyalty indomitable spirit and sacrifice of those Polish fliers. They were our staunchest Allies in our darkest days; may they always be remembered as such!\\" In popular culture Kent was portrayed by Milo Gibson in the 2018 film Hurricane: 303 Squadron.

(ACS) was a company that provided information technology services as well as business process outsourcing solutions to businesses, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. ACS was based in Dallas, Texas. ACS was ranked at number 341 on the 2010 Fortune 500 list. Founded in 1988, by Darwin Deason, ACS operated in nearly 100 countries, generating over $6 billion annually. As of September 2009, ACS employed approximately 74,000 people. On September 28, 2009, Xerox Corporation announced plans to acquire ACS in a $6.4 billion transaction. The deal closed on February 8, 2010. Company history Affiliated Computer Services, Inc. (ACS) was founded by Darwin Deason in 1988. Initially created as a data services provider to the financial services industry, Deason led ACS's expansion into the communications, education, financial services, government, healthcare, insurance, manufacturing, retail, and travel and transportation industries. ACS expanded beyond banking BPO services when it signed a 10-year data processing outsourcing contract with Southland Corporation (7-Eleven). In 1995 ACS became a public company and divested bank data processing. By FY 1996 ACS became the fourth largest commercial outsource provider in the U.S. More recently, ACS was best known for its Transportation Solutions Group (TSG), which supported transportation services including electronic toll collection, management of cities‚Äô parking systems, and photo traffic enforcement. In 2009, ACS ranked #401 on the FORTUNE 500 list and employed about 74,000 people around the world who served thousands of commercial and government clients. In February 2010, following its acquisition by Xerox, ACS was replaced by Urban Outfitters on the Standard & Poor 500 Index. On July 1, 2015, Xerox sold the IT Outsourcing business to Atos. Xerox indicated that ITO did not line up with its vision of integration of BPO (business process outsourcing) and the legacy document handling concerns. On July 29, 2016 the US District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the lawsuit pursued by Matthew Sciabacucchi. The lawsuit contended that some Xerox Corp directors and officers had abrogated their fiduciary duties in connection with the company's $6.4 billion acquisition of ACS in 2010. On January 3, 2017, a company called Conduent was spun off as a divestiture from Xerox. The business scope of Conduent was generally understood to be essentially identical to that of the former Affiliated Computer Services (ACS). In February 2020 efforts to demolish the company's former headquarters building in Dallas failed. SEC Investigation In 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) notified ACS that they were conducting an informal investigation into certain stock option grants made by the company from October 1998 through March 2005. This was due to the improper and unethical practice of back-dating stock options to specific low points in the stock value. ACS said the executives improperly backdated the price of options grants during a period from 1994 to 2005. During that time, ACS said the executives deliberately chose days on which ACS's stock took a dip as the effective date for the options, making them more valuable when exercised. Rich, King, and Edwards \\"used hindsight to select favorable grant dates,\\" ACS said in a statement. CEO Mark King and CFO Warren Edwards, both implicated in the wrongdoing, resigned immediately. The former CEO Jeff Rich previously retired at the beginning of the year.

The study began in 1994. The first results were published in The Lancet in 2002, and the 10 year data were published again in The Lancet in early September 2005. 2,143 study participants were mostly drawn from U.K. hospitals with the rest drawn from North American and European hospitals. The study found better results with endovascular coil treatment compared to surgical clipping, however subsequent studies have questioned this conclusion.AJNR Am J Neuroradiol. 2005 Feb;26(2):367-72. The study was criticised by many clinicians and not well accepted by surgeons.Michael Forsting, Isabel Wanke, Intracranial Vascular Malformations and Aneurysms: From Diagnostic Work-Up to Endovascular Therapy, Springer 2008, . Primary criticisms were related to the study's patient population's generalisability to the wider population, and the long term prognosis of coil embolisation.Michael J. Alexander, Robert Friedrich Spetzler, Pediatric neurovascular disease: surgical, endovascular, and medical management, Thieme: 2006, , page 145. Study design and results ISAT sought to measure outcomes of cerebral aneurysm patients at 2 and 12 months using a type of a Rankin scale.Michael S. Horowitz, Elad I. Levy, Neuroendovascular surgery, Karger Publishers, 2005, . The study was halted in 2002 after the oversight committee found increased morbidity with clipping over endovascular coiling. Criticism ISAT was criticised on a number of factors, many related to the randomization of the patient population. The patient population was on average younger, and the majority had aneurysms under 10 mm and in anterior circulation. The randomized patient population in the ISAT was younger on average than the population of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients in the U.S. and Japan.Adnan I. Qureshi, Textbook of Interventional Neurology, Ed. Adnan I. Qureshi, Alexandros L. Georgiadis, Cambridge University Press: 2011, . In response to these criticisms a facility that participated in ISAT compared the clinical outcomes of their patients that were not selected for the study to those that were. They reported finding outcomes similar to the ISAT. Subsequent analysis Although the initial ISAT analysis appeared to favor endovascular coiling over microsurgical clipping, subsequent meta-analysis have questioned that conclusion, finding higher incidences of recurrence.See, Raja PV, Huang J, Germanwala AV, Gailloud P, Murphy KP, Tamargo RJ. Microsurgical clipping and endovascular coiling of intracranial aneurysms: A critical review of the literature. Neurosurgery 62: 1187-1202, June 2008 A large meta-analysis from Johns Hopkins University published in Neurosurgery concluded that \\"there is no clear consensus in these two studies or in the 45 observational studies included.\\" Updated data from the ISAT group in March 2008 shows that the higher aneurysm rate of recurrence is also associated with a higher rebleeding rate, given that the rebleed rate of coiled aneurysms appears to be 8 times higher than that of clipping treated aneurysms in this study.Mitchell P, Kerr R, Mendelow AD, Molyneux A. Could late rebleeding overturn the superiority of cranial aneurysm coil embolization over clip ligation seen in ISAT? Journal of Neurosurgery 108: 437-442, March 2008 The ISAT authors conclude that \\"when treating ruptured cerebral aneurysms, the advantage of coil embolization over clip ligation cannot be assumed for patients < 40 years old.\\" Other subsequent studies have questioned the ISAT's conclusions directly.See, J Neurosurg. 2010 Oct;113(4):795-801. This conclusion is based on a number of methodological assumptions itself and other authors have cautioned about extending it to other patient populations.J Mocco, L. Nelson Hopkins, \\"International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial analysis\\", Journal of Neurosurgery, March 2008 / Vol. 108 / No. 3 / Pages 436-436. It appears that although endovascular coiling is associated with a shorter recovery period as compared to surgical clipping, it is also associated with a significantly higher recurrence rate after treatment. The long-term data for unruptured aneurysms are still being gathered.

This festival is dedicated to Sri Krishna. On this auspicious day, an image of Krishna, richly adorned and besmeared with colored powder (Abir in Bengali and Odia and Assamese languages), is taken out in procession in a swinging palanquin, decorated with flowers, leaves, colored clothes and papers. The procession proceeds forward to the accompaniment of music, blaring of conch shells, trumpets and shouts of 'Joi' (victory) and 'Hari Bol' in odisha. Odia women wash their Angans with cowdung and decorate with rice powder and flowers. Milk items like home made curd, cream, butter and 'panchamrit' are offered. The people who accompany are offered sweets and drinks. In villages, drinks made of curd are distributed among people and rejoiced by putting Vermillion on each other. Dol Purnima becomes all the more significant for Bengalis, because this is also the birthday of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1485‚Äì1533). He was a great Vaishnava saint, who popularized modern sankirtana. He elevated the passion of Radha and Krishna to a high spiritual plane. He underlined the emotional at the cost of the ceremonial side of devotion. Followers of Chaitanya School of Vaishnavism believe Chaitanya to be the manifestation of Krishna. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu believed that the essence of sadhana is always the loving remembrance of Hari. Days of Celebration The first day of Deul is known as gondh. In the evening time, the full incarnation of Lord Vishnu, god Krishna become ready to visit Ghunucha's (one of the wife of Krishna) place. His followers make a bonfire in front of the kirtan-ghar and with the beat of Vaishnavite drums, cymbals, idol of Krishna carried round the firework and then to the doul. During the festival, all the regular religious functions of kirtan ghar (prayer house) are performed. The second day of Deul is known as Bhor-Deul, meaning main Dol. Bhor Deul is celebrated for just one day in the month of Chot and two three days in the month of Phalgun. The idols are coloured with faku on this day. The third day of Deul is also spent in the same manner as that of the second day. The last and the fourth day of Doul festival is called Sueri. On that day, god Krishna is supposed to go back to the house of mother Lakshmi from the house of Ghunucha. Devotees bring down god Krishna to a palanquin (dola) and carried in a procession. Participation of people from various regions creates a sea of devotees there. In the rhythm of the Vaishnavite drums, cymbals, conches, etc., Holi songs rend the sky. People throw coloured powders to one another. When the procession arrived at kirtan ghar, the gate is block with bamboos by the followers of Mother Lakshmi. It is believed that, Mother Lakshmi become angry with her husband god Krishna, because He stayed at Ghunucha's place for all these days. The followers of Mother Lakshmi therefore stop the opposite group from entering her house. But at last, the bamboos are broken and Lord Krishna entered the campus and takes seven round of kirtan ghar. ‚ÄòHe tires and takes rest for a while. Taking advantage of the peace, a devotee from Lakshmi‚Äôs side ‚Äòreproves‚Äô him; one of his devotees returns the reproof. An interesting verbal duel thus ensues. In the end he admits defeat, like a peace loving husband, satisfies her with money and other presents and earns His admittance into the shrine. There ends the great Deul festival‚Äô (Das, 1972:89-90). Bibliography *Verma, Vanish (2002). Fasts and Festivals of India. New Delhi: Diamond Pocket Books.

Leslie gained prominence as a catwalk model in 2000, working for stores including David Jones. That same year, she was a finalist on the television series Search for a Supermodel and the runner-up for Miss World Australia. In 2005, Leslie was arrested in Bali after police reported discovering two ecstasy tablets in her handbag. She was convicted and sentenced to three months' imprisonment. Upon returning to Australia, Leslie stated police had planted the drugs in her bag and then demanded a US$25,000 bribe to avoid going to prison, which she could not afford to pay. While in custody, Leslie dressed in Islamic clothing, stating she did so to shield herself from both the media and sexual assault from corrections officers. The decision faced a backlash from some Muslims, who accused her of using Islam as a stunt to gain the court's favour. Leslie's arrest and her choice of clothing in custody resulted in considerable attention from the Australian media. After returning to Australia, Leslie travelled to Cambodia to help raise money for local orphanages. She returned to the catwalk in Australia in 2006, but struggled to find regular work as a model following the publicity from her arrest. In 2007, she launched a line of clothing for dogs, and the following year, began a career as an interior designer. Early career Michelle Leslie was born in Adelaide, South Australia, to Albert and Violeta Leslie. Violeta was a nurse and one of 12 siblings born in the Philippines. Albert played for the Australian basketball team, and met Violeta while on a layover in the Philippines before travelling to the Olympics. Violeta emigrated to Australia, and Albert went on to become an assistant coach to the Adelaide 36ers. A self-confessed tomboy when young, Leslie was educated at Sacred Heart College in Adelaide, and became interested in modelling only after her father gave her a course at a modelling school as a 15th birthday present. She enjoyed it enough to undertake a second course, and shortly thereafter left school in order to pursue a full-time modelling career. She soon emerged as one of the \\"most prominent catwalk and catalogue models\\" in Adelaide, working for stores such as David Jones, Harris Scarfe and Myer. In 2000, she appeared as one of the 20 finalists in the first series of the Australian Search for a Supermodel reality show, and was first runner-up in the 2000 Miss World Australia pageant held in Darwin. She was \\"catapulted on to the international catwalk\\" when Asian Australian models became in demand. As a result, she gained work within Asia, appearing under the name \\"Michelle Lee\\". She also moved to New York temporarily in 2003 for modelling opportunities. Off the catwalks she gained prominence as one of the two models involved in a 2004 advertising campaign for Antz Pantz underwear and, prior to this, as the face of the Crystelle lingerie brand. Arrest and trial On 21 August 2005, Leslie was travelling in a vehicle to an open-air dance party at Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park on the Indonesian island of Bali. Police stopped the vehicle and reported discovering two pills in Leslie's handbag. Forensic tests subsequently found the pills to be the drug ecstasy. Urine tests conducted at the time of her arrest showed no evidence of the use of the drug; a later blood test found traces of amphetamines. According to Indonesian police, Leslie stated the pills were given to her by a friend, \\"Mia\\". Mia was later revealed to be Nameera Azmaan, who was also a model based in Singapore and working for Chic Management, the same agency Leslie worked for. Leslie denied making the allegation, and Azmaan also denied any involvement. Leslie denied other statements attributed to her by police reports, including that she had been taking ecstasy for a year and could not enjoy parties without it. Police reports also stated she declared her religion as Christianity upon her arrest. According to Balinese newspapers, Leslie was arrested while in the company of a son of the then Coordinating Minister for the Economy Aburizal Bakrie and two unidentified men, one said to be the son of a man with \\"strong influence in the law and justice system\\". Police gave \\"vague and contradicting\\" reports regarding who Leslie was with when she was arrested, with media alleging this was an attempt to protect their identities. Leslie was one of five people arrested by police during their raid that night; according to Leslie's lawyers, two of the people arrested quickly bribed their way out of any further trouble. The incident marked the third arrest of Australians in Bali on drugs charges in twelve months following the Schapelle Corby and Bali Nine cases, and resulted in considerable media attention. Her arrest prompted then Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer to warn Australians about the dangers of drug possession while travelling in Asia, and led then Australian Prime Minister John Howard to comment that Australians caught with drugs \\"can't expect the Government to bail them out.\\" In October 2005, it was reported that Leslie's lawyers had provided a report from a Sydney doctor stating that Leslie was addicted to prescription medication. Under Indonesian law this would allow her to be tried as a \\"user\\"; the maximum sentence for a user is three months' imprisonment, whereas the maximum penalty for possession is 15 years. Leslie was tried in the Denpasar District Court, and was found guilty of using a prohibited substance on 18 November. She was ordered to pay court costs and sentenced to three months in jail but, due to the three months already spent in custody, was freed from Kerobokan Prison on 19 November. She was deported from the country due to her conviction. Leslie flew out of Bali to Singapore where she spent time with friends and family before returning to Sydney. =Return to Australia= Professor Catharine Lumby, then head of media studies at the University of Sydney, said many Australians would have sympathy for Leslie, and predicted she would be highly sought out by companies for modelling after returning to Australia, as she would be perceived as a \\"cult figure\\". Leslie declined to sell her story upon her return to Australia, on the grounds she believed she would face further criticism for profiting from the ordeal. She instead gave unpaid interviews to 60 Minutes and New Idea, the latter of whom donated money to a Cambodian orphanage she was raising funds for; Leslie received an AU$70,000 payment from New Idea for an interview while she was still in prison prior to being convicted. In the 60 Minutes interview, Leslie professed her innocence, noting that she had been detained for several minutes at the police road block and would have had plenty of time to better conceal or throw away two ecstasy tablets. She instead freely gave her handbag to police on request, whom she accused of planting the drugs and then demanding a US$25,000 bribe to make the charges disappear. Leslie believes police targeted her on the belief she was wealthy and well-connected because she was a model; her parents had to mortgage their home to help pay her legal fees, which came close to AU$300,000. Leslie states police tampered with her blood to make it test positive for drugs in front of her and her lawyer, and mocked her when she protested. Her lawyer subsequently advised her to plead guilty, saying that such tactics were commonly used by police in Bali and she would likely spend 15 years in prison if she maintained her innocence. =Islam controversy= During her incarceration, Leslie announced through a spokesman that she had converted to the Islamic faith eighteen months prior to her arrest. Leslie chose to wear a burqa on one occasion when she appeared in court, and opted to wear Islamic dress, such as a hijab, until she was released. Her conversion and choice of dress sparked debate among Australian Muslims, some of whom accused her of using Islam as a stunt to gain the court's favour. Her lawyer offered an apology to any Muslims who were offended, saying that Leslie had worn the clothes to avoid unwanted attention from the prison guards and journalists. Professor Tim Lindsey, then director of the Asian Law Centre at the University of Melbourne, stated that wearing Islamic clothing would make no sense as a legal defence, as Indonesian prisons were full of \\"Muslims convicted by Muslims\\". Criticism also emerged when she was seen wearing tight- fitting clothing on her departure from the prison. After her release Leslie stated she had no regrets regarding how she conducted herself in prison, though apologised for any offence caused by wearing the burqa. The Australian Federation of Islamic Councils initially stated they had no problem with Leslie being a Muslim; their president Ameer Ali recommended that she refrain from returning to her former career as \\"a model for lingerie and underwear\\" after returning to Australia, as such behaviour was \\"not allowed in Islam\\". In the 60 Minutes interview, Leslie stated she wore Islamic clothing because she was afraid of being sexually assaulted by male prison guards, and to protect herself when she faced the media. When asked if she had even been a Muslim, she replied \\"Yeah, but I don't really know what makes you or not makes you a Muslim. I'm not a practising Muslim, no.\\" Following the 60 Minutes interview, Leslie's former friend Norah Cullen told journalists Leslie fabricated the story about being a Muslim, and only wore the burqa to conceal her face from the media. Cullen, a Muslim herself, had previously told journalists Leslie's conversion to Islam was genuine. Later career Upon her return to Australia, Leslie left her then modelling agency, Chic Management, to sign with Max Markson. Shortly thereafter she travelled to Cambodia to help raise money for the charity Krousar Thmey, meeting with King Norodom Sihamoni and spending time in local orphanages. Leslie arrived back in Australia shortly before Australian Fashion Week, and returned to the catwalk there for the first time in April 2006, modelling swimwear for designer Michael Azzollini. Leslie had several modelling jobs after returning to Australia, but struggled to find steady work as a model. In 2007, she launched a range of clothing for dogs, \\"Miyow & Barkley\\". Working with her friend Traci Griffith, they experienced early success when their first range of clothing and accessories sold out shortly after being launched. In 2008 she launched an interior design business, Michelle Leslie Design, which she was still running as of December 2018. Personal life In September 2003, Leslie began a relationship with Scott Sutton, heir to the Suttons Holden chain of Holden dealerships in Sydney. Leslie separated from Sutton in July 2007, and began dating magazine publisher Adam Zammit the following month. Leslie and Zammit were married in New Zealand in October 2012, but separated two years later. In October 2016 she met singer Daniel Johns via a mutual friend. Following months of media speculation as to whether they were dating, the couple went public with their relationship in July 2017.

After the attention received by his novel Rituelen (Rituals, 1980), which received the Pegasus Prize, it was the first of his novels to be translated into an English edition, published in 1983 by Louisiana State University Press of the United States. LSU Press published his first two novels in English in the following years, as well as other works through 1990. Harcourt (now Houghton Mifflin Harcourt) and Grove Press have since published some of his works in English. Nooteboom has won numerous literary awards and has been mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in literature. Life Cornelis Johannes Jacobus Maria \\"Cees\\" Nooteboom was born on 31 July 1933 in The Hague, Netherlands. Dick Welsink, \\"Cees Nooteboom: een leven in data\\", Cees Nooteboom. Ik had wel duizend levens en ik nam er maar √©√©n! (1997). Retrieved on 2012-10-10. His father was killed there in 1945 by a British air raid during World War II. After his mother remarried in 1948, his Catholic stepfather enrolled Nooteboom in several religious secondary schools, including a Franciscan school in Venray and a school run by the Augustinians in Eindhoven. He finished his secondary education at a night school in Utrecht. After his first job with a bank in Hilversum, Nooteboom traveled throughout Europe. In addition to his independent writing, he worked for the weekly magazine, Elsevier, from 1957 to 1960, and at the newspaper de Volkskrant from 1961 to 1968. In 1967, he became the travel editor of the magazine Avenue. In 1957 Nooteboom hired on as a sailor on a freighter to Suriname in order to earn money and ask for the hand of his first wife, Fanny Lichtveld. They married but later divorced in 1964. Some of his travel experiences are recounted in the book De verliefde gevangene (1958). He was also in a relationship with the singer, Liesbeth List. Nooteboom is married to Simone Sassen and divides his time between Amsterdam, Germany and the island of Menorca. On 2 September 2019 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from UCL, London. Literary works Nooteboom (right, holding the Sunday Times) with singer/actress Liesbeth List, and Frans Myts, (1967) Nooteboom's first novel, Philip en de anderen (Philip and the Others, 1988 English translation), was published in 1954 and won the Anne Frank Prize. His second novel, De ridder is gestorven (1963) (The Knight Has Died, English edition, 1990) was his last for 17 years. During that period, he was working for publications and writing poetry and travel books. In 1980, his third novel Rituelen (Rituals, 1983) brought him wide acclaim in the Netherlands, winning the Pegasus Prize. It was his first novel to be translated into English and was published by Louisiana State University Press, which published two of his earlier novels in English, as well as others through 1990. Other novels include Een lied van schijn en wezen (A Song of Truth and Semblance, 1984); Allerzielen (1998)(All Souls' Day, 2001), and Paradijs verloren (Paradise Lost, 2007). His best-known work to English-speaking audiences is perhaps The Following Story (Het volgende verhaal, 1991), which was written for the Dutch Boekenweek in 1991. It won the Aristeion Prize in 1993. Nooteboom is also a well-known travel writer. Some of his travel books include Een middag in Bruay, Een nacht in Tunesi√´, and De omweg naar Santiago (Roads to Santiago, 1997), an anthology of his writings on Spain. This last book inspired the musical work Six Glosses (2010) by Spanish composer Benet Casablancas. Nooteboom's experiences living in Berlin are detailed in the book Berlijn 1989-2009, which collects his earlier books, Berlijnse notities and Terugkeer naar Berlijn, and new material.Nooteboom, Cees. Berlijn 1989/2009 (De Bezige Bij, 2009), p. 413. The book De omweg naar Santiago inspired several Spanish and Dutch composers. It has been the subject of the tourn√©e of concerts celebrated in 2010 in The Netherlands by the Ensemble 88 from Maastricht.

The show was produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and broadcast on NBC from September 9, 1978, to September 1, 1979. The Galaxy Guardians‚Äîa.k.a. the \\"Galaxy Goof-ups\\"‚Äîconsisted of Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, Quack-Up and Scare Bear as space patrolmen under the leadership of Captain Snerdley; the four of them always goofed up while on duty, and spent most of their time in disco clubs. Despite their constant bumbling, however, they always emerged victorious. The show originally aired as a segment on Yogi's Space Race from September 9 to October 28, 1978, and was the most popular segment on that show. Following the cancellation of Yogi's Space Race, Galaxy Goof-Ups was given its own half-hour timeslot on NBC beginning November 4, 1978. The show has been rebroadcast on USA Cartoon Express, Nickelodeon, TNT, Cartoon Network and Boomerang. Characters The \\"Galaxy Goof-Ups\\" characters (Yogi Bear, Scare Bear, Huckleberry Hound and Quack-Up) are all from Space Race, except for the following two new characters who are exclusive to this series: Captain Snerdley: The Commander of the Galaxy Goof-Ups, Captain Snerdley is forced to put up with their clumsiness since they somehow solve the cases that they are assigned to. In \\"The Dopey Defenders\\", to make sure the new equipment will work better, he had installed a mechanism which keeps them from touching it. General Bullhorn: Bullhorn is Snerdley's superior. He is unaware of the Goof-Ups' incompetence and blames Snerdley for whatever goes wrong. In one episode he is seen removing medals (along with pieces of uniform) from Snerdley every time they commit a blunder.

The \\"needles\\" may be quill-like or feathery. Most anthodites are made of the mineral aragonite (a variety of calcium carbonate, CaCO3), although some are composed of gypsum (CaSO4¬∑2H2O). The term anthodite is first cited in the scientific literature in 1965 by Japanese researcher N. Kashima,Kashima, N. (1965), Mem. Ehime Univ., Sect. 2, Ser. D, 5, 79. who described \\"flower-like dripstone\\" composed of \\"an alternation of calcite and aragonite\\".Hey, M.H. and P.G. Embrey (1974), \\"Twenty-eighth List of New Mineral Names\\" , Mineralogical Magazine, December 1974, Vol. 39, pp 903‚Äì932.See also the abstract in Min. Abstr. 18-282. Structure, composition and appearance  The individual crystals of anthodites develop in a form described as \\"acicular\\" (needle-like) and often branch out as they grow. They usually grow downward from a cave's ceiling. Aragonite crystals are contrasted with those made of calcite (another variety of calcium carbonate) in that the latter tend to be stubby or dog- tooth-like (\\"rhombohedral\\", rather than acicular). Anthodites often have a solid core of aragonite and may have huntite or hydromagnesite deposited near the ends of the branches. Anthodite crystals vary in size from less than a millimeter to about a meter, but are commonly between 1 and 20 millimeters in length. Occurrence Anthodites may occur sporadically throughout some limestone caves, but may be spectacularly abundant in others, with clean white crystals growing all over the calcite or other rock surfaces. Examples of sites with abundant anthodite displays include Carlsbad Caverns, Craighead Caverns, Skyline Caverns in the United States and the Grotte de Moulis in France. Types Among the \\"quill-like\\" varieties of anthodite is sometimes included the \\"sea urchin-like\\" formation known as flos ferri,Hill, C. A. and P. Forti, eds (1997), Cave Minerals of the World, 2nd ed., Huntsville, Alabama: National Speleological Society. although othersShaw, T. (1992), History of Cave Science: The Exploration and Study of Limestone Caves to 1900, 2nd ed., Sydney Speleological Society, Broadway, NSW, Australia. have considered them a slender variety of helictite. Among the \\"feathery\\" varieties of anthodite is \\"frostwork\\", a type of speleothem consisting of \\"bushes\\" of fine acicular aragonite crystals in radiating clusters. Their appearance is often compared to that of a cactus or thistle plant. In its composite stalagmite form, frostwork may possess spiny limbs like a miniature fir tree. The term was first used by cave guides at Wind Cave in South Dakota, USA, during the 1890s to describe speleothems which looked like ice \\"frostwork\\". Anthodite-like formations *Helictites are curved or angular twig-like lateral projections of calcium carbonate, which appear to defy gravity. Rather than radial clusters, helictites often occur in tangled masses. The \\"twigs\\" have a tiny central canal. *Cave flowers (also known as \\"gypsum flowers\\" or \\"oulopholites\\") consist of gypsum or epsomite. In contrast to anthodites, the needles or \\"petals\\" of cave flowers grow from the attached end. *Cave cotton (also called \\"gypsum cotton\\") is very thin, flexible filaments of gypsum or epsomite projecting from a cave wall.

Production While in pre-production, Hanna-Barbera originally proposed an updated version of The Jetsons, in which Elroy would be a teenager and Judy would have a steady job as an ace reporter. CBS, under the leadership of Fred Silverman, discarded the idea and decided to make an animated version of The Partridge Family instead. The Partridge Family had already been recurring characters on a previous Hanna-Barbera production, Goober and the Ghost Chasers. In this new iteration of the series, The Partridge Family is‚Äîwithout any explanation‚Äîliving in a Jetsons-like futuristic environment in 2200 A.D. The family's \\"galaxy-famous\\" musical act is notably more successful than in the live-action show, and they appear to manage themselves: the character of Ruben Kincaid is not a regular. Danny has a robotic dog named Orbit, and Keith and Laurie have two good friends that travel with the family (though they are not part of the musical act): Marion, a two-toned green and blue Martian who can fly, and Veenie, a purple-haired Venusian with a distinct buzzing vocal tic. Danny Bonaduce, Suzanne Crough and Brian Forster voiced their respective characters from the live action series. Susan Dey provided Laurie's voice for only two episodes before she was replaced by former Mouseketeer Sherry Alberoni. Chuck McLenan served as both the speaking and singing voice of Keith Partridge instead of David Cassidy; Joan Gerber voiced Shirley Partridge in place of Shirley Jones, while John Stephenson took over the role of Reuben Kincaid from Dave Madden in the few episodes in which he appears. Micky Dolenz, a member of a previous made-for-television band (The Monkees), had various recurring roles in the series, one of his first voice-over roles. Sixteen half-hour episodes were produced for Partridge Family 2200 A.D., which lasted half a season on CBS Saturday morning (September 7, 1974 ‚Äì March 8, 1975). In 1977‚Äì78, it was retitled The Partridge Family in Outer Space when episodes were serialized on the syndicated weekday series Fred Flintstone and Friends. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the series contained a laugh track created by the studio. Due to its ties to The Partridge Family, Partridge Family 2200 A.D. is one of only two Hanna-Barbera produced series since H-B's 1967 sale to Taft Broadcasting that are owned outright by Sony Pictures Television (whose predecessor, Screen Gems, produced the live-action series); Jeannie (an animated spin-off of I Dream of Jeannie) is the other (the copyrights to both animated series are currently held by CPT Holdings).

He was a significant influence on studio pottery of the twentieth century, and a major figure of the mingei folk-art movement, establishing the town of Mashiko as a world-renowned pottery centre. In 1955 he was designated a \\"Living National Treasure\\".  Biography  Hamada was born in Kawasaki, Japan, in 1894 named . After finishing elitist Hibiya High School, he studied ceramics at Tokyo Institute of Technology, then known as Tokyo Industrial College with Kawai Kanjir≈ç under Itaya Hazan. As the sole students in the school interested in becoming artist-potters, Hamada and the slightly elder Kawai were soon friends, touring the city in search of inspiration.Leach, 1990:93 They worked together in Kyoto at the former body of the Kyoto Municipal Institute of Industrial Technology and Culture where they experimented on glazes using various minerals. They were acquainted by Yanagi S≈çetsu and Tomimoto Kenkichi while visiting potteries and exhibitions. Hamada was deeply impressed by a Tokyo exhibition of ceramic art by Bernard Leach, who was then staying with Yanagi S≈çetsu, and wrote to Leach seeking an introduction. The two found much in common and became good friends, so much so that Hamada asked and was granted permission to accompany Leach to England in 1920 when the latter decided to return and establish a pottery there.  Pottery in Mashiko  Having spent three years in St Ives with Bernard Leach, he returned to Japan in 1923 and traveled to potteries and stayed at Tsuboya in Okinawa Prefecture for weeks, then eventually established his workshop in Mashiko, about north-east of Tokyo. Here, he built his own pottery and committed himself to using only locally sourced materials, not only in the clay he used, but also the glazes he created and the brushes he manufactured himself from dog hair and bamboo. In 1955 the Japanese government designated him \\"Living National Treasure\\", the first time for someone from the field of crafts. The previous year on 29 May 1954, the Cultural Property Protection Act had been amended, and a new Preservers of Important Intangible Cultural Properties (J≈´y≈ç Mukei Bunkazai Hojisha) designation was passed the bill in November for its criteria and approval details. Following Yanagi Muneyoshi, Hamada was enthusiastic about folk art movement in Japan. When Yanagi died in 1961, he succeeded as the second director of the Japanese Folk Crafts Museum, and in 1977, he opened his own museum at his home, Mashiko Sank≈çkan (present Shoji Hamada Memorial Mashiko Sankokan Museum), and exhibited his collection of folk crafts from Japan and abroad. Hamada Shoji was very supportive of young artists who moved to Mashiko such as his student Shimaoka Tatsuz≈ç, and Kamoda Sh≈çji, and was also important in establishing Mashiko as a destination for day tourism. He provided housing and hosted workplace for visiting potters from abroad as well. Hamada died in Mashiko on January 5, 1978.  Preserving local architecture  Sh≈çji Hamada Memorial Mashiko Sankokan Museum Since he moved to Mashiko, Hamada bought, relocated, and refurbished traditional farm houses, stone warehouses, and nagaya-mon gatehouses of Edo period unique to southern Tochigi Prefecture on his property. The first was his residence in 1930, followed by others he used as workshops and for entertaining guests and apprentices, with the last one used since 1942 as his workshop. In 1989 his residence was donated to and rebuilt at Mashiko Museum of Ceramic Art, or Ceramic Art Messe Mashiko, after the house was designated a cultural property of Mashiko. The museum is still open today and visitors can view Hamada's studio, living quarters, and various craft collections.  Influence  Throughout a lifetime dedicated to making pottery he achieved international recognition and his works have been collected by museums across the world. Hamada influence was felt not only in his native Japan, particularly in Mashiko, but also in the West. In the United Kingdom and the US his style and philosophy became well known amongst studio potters, and he was revered as the archetypal \\"Oriental\\" potter.

On August 22, 1851, America won the Royal Yacht Squadron's regatta around the Isle of Wight by 18 minutes. The Squadron's \\"One Hundred Sovereign Cup\\" or \\"¬£100 Cup\\", sometimes mistakenly known in America as the \\"One Hundred Guinea Cup,\\" was later renamed after the original winning yacht.  America's origins  A syndicate of New York Yacht Club members, headed by NYYC charter member Commodore John Cox Stevens, with members Edwin A. Stevens, George Schuyler, Hamilton Wilkes, and J. Beekman Finley, would build a yacht to sail to England. The purpose of this visit was twofold: to show off U.S. shipbuilding skill and make money through competing in yachting regattas. Stevens employed the services of the shipyard of William H. Brown and his chief designer, George Steers. She was launched on May 3, 1851, from the Brown shipyard, near Elventh Street, East River, New York. She cost $30,000.  Designer  America was built on the lines of Mary Taylor (1849) America 1851, by James Bard America was designed by James Rich Steers and George Steers (1820‚Äì1856) (See George Steers and Co). Traditional \\"cod- head-and-mackerel-tail\\" design gave boats a blunt bow and a sharp stern with the widest point (the beam) placed one-third of the length aft of the bow. George Steers' pilot boat designs, however, had a concave clipper-bow with the beam of the vessel at midships. As a result, his schooner-rigged pilot boats were among the fastest and most seaworthy of their day. They had to be seaworthy, for they met inbound and outbound vessels in any kind of weather. These vessels also had to be fast, for harbor pilots competed with each other for business. In addition to pilot boats, Steers designed and built 17 yachts, some which were favourites with the New York Yacht Club.  Captain  America was captained by Richard Brown, who was also a skilled member of the Sandy Hook Pilots group, renowned worldwide for their expertise in manoeuvering the shoals around New York Harbor. They were highly skilled racers as a result of impromptu races between pilots to ships in need of pilot services. Brown had sailed aboard the pilot boat Mary Taylor No. 17, designed by George Steers, of whom he was a personal friend. He chose as first mate Nelson Comstock, a newcomer to yacht racing.  Events leading to the race  Mus√©e de la Marine. Crewed by Brown and eight professional sailors, with George Steers, his older brother James, and James' son George as passengers, America left New York on June 21, 1851, and arrived at Le Havre on July 11. They were joined there by Commodore Stevens. After drydocking and repainting America left for Cowes, Isle of Wight, on July 30. While there the crew enjoyed the hospitality of the Royal Yacht Squadron while Stevens searched for someone who would race against his yacht. The British yachting community had been following the construction of America with interest and perhaps some trepidation. When America showed up on the Solent on July 31 there was one yacht, Laverock, that appeared for an impromptu race. The accounts of the race are contradictory: a British newspaper said Laverock held her own, but Stevens later reported that America beat her handily. Whatever the outcome, it seemed to have discouraged other British yachtsmen from challenging America to a match. She never raced until the last day of the Royal Yacht Squadron's annual members-only regatta for which Queen Victoria customarily donated the prize. Because of Americas presence, a special provision was made to \\"open to all nations\\" a race of 'round the Isle of Wight, with no reservation for time allowance.  The race  The race was held on August 22, 1851, with a 10:00 AM start for a line of seven schooners and another line of eight cutters. America had a slow start due to a fouled anchor and was well behind when she finally got under way. Within half an hour however, she was in 5th place and gaining. The eastern shoals of the Isle of Wight are called the Nab Rocks. Traditionally, races would sail around the east (seaward) side of the lightship that marked the edge of the shoal, but one could sail between the lightship and the mainland if they had a knowledgeable pilot. America had such a pilot and he took her down the west (landward) side of the lightship. After the race a contestant protested this action, but was overruled because the official race rules did not specify on which side of the lightship a boat had to pass. This tactic put America in the lead, which she held throughout the rest of the race. At one point the jib boom broke due to a crew error, but it was replaced in fifteen minutes. On the final leg of the race the yacht Aurora closed but was 18 minutes behind when America finished shortly after 6:00 PM. Legend has it that while watching the race, Queen Victoria asked who was second, and received the famous reply: \\"There is no second, your Majesty.\\"  Subsequent owners John Cox Stevens and the syndicate from the New York Yacht Club owned the America from the time that she was launched on May 3, 1851, until ten days after she won the regatta that made her famous. On September 1, 1851, the yacht was sold to John de Blaquiere, 2nd Baron de Blaquiere. In late July 1852, America ran aground at Portsmouth, Hampshire and was damaged. De Blaquiere raced her only a few times before selling her in 1856 to Henry Montagu Upton, 2nd Viscount Templetown, who renamed her Camilla but failed to use or maintain her. In 1858, she was sold to Henry Sotheby Pitcher, a shipbuilder in Northfleet, Kent. He rebuilt Camilla and sold her to Henry Edward Decie in 1860, who brought her back to the United States. Decie sold the ship to the Confederate States of America the same year for use as a blockade runner in the American Civil War, though he remained aboard as captain. The yacht was renamed Memphis, but the details of her Confederate service are unclear. In 1862, she was scuttled in Dunns Creek, north of Crescent City, Florida when Union troops took the city of Jacksonville. She was raised, repaired, and renamed America by the Union and served the United States Navy on the blockade until May 1863. She was armed with three smoothbore bronze cannon designed by John A. Dahlgren and cast at the Washington Navy Yard. A 12-pounder was located on the bow and two 24-pounders were placed amidships. She was assigned to the federal blockading squadron off Charleston, South Carolina, and was on patrol the night of March 19, 1863, when she spotted the smoke of a blockade runner near Dewees Inlet, South Carolina. She immediately launched colored signal flares to alert the rest of the fleet. The runner proved to be the CSS Georgiana, which was described as the most powerful Confederate cruiser then afloat. America's action ultimately resulted in the Georgianas wreck and destruction. Georgiana was the most important vessel to be captured or destroyed by the federal blockade. In 1863 America became a training ship at the United States Naval Academy. On August 8, 1870, the Navy entered her in the America's Cup race at New York Harbor, where she finished fourth. thumb America remained in the Navy until 1873, when she was sold to Benjamin Butler for $5,000. Butler hired James H. Reid who was in charge of her for sixteen years. They raced and maintained her well, commissioning a rebuild by Donald McKay in 1875. Butler and Reid sailed a race with the schooner Resolute, off the Isles of Shoals and won the race. Later, she sailed a squadron race and won. In the winter 1881, when she was lengthened 6 1/2 feet, Reid and Butler sailed her on a cruise to the West Indies returning to Boston in 1882. A total refit of the rig was done in 1885 by Edward Burgess to keep her competitive. Butler died in 1893 and his son Paul inherited the schooner, but he had no interest in her and gave her to his nephew Butler Ames in 1897. Ames reconditioned America and used her occasionally for racing and casual sailing until 1901, when she fell into disuse and disrepair. America was sold to a company headed by Charles Foster in 1917, and in 1921 was sold to the America Restoration Fund, which donated her to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. =Fate= In 1923 America was given the hull designation of IX-41. She was not maintained there either and became seriously decayed by 1940. The shed which housed America collapsed during a heavy snowstorm on March 29, 1942. The remains of the shed and ship were scrapped and burned in 1945. America was one of only three ships in commission in the U.S. Navy in both the Civil War and World War II, joined by the USS Constitution and USS Constellation. Legacy The New York Yacht Club acquired several relics from America after her destruction. These include her transom eagle, rudder post and one of her masts. The mast serves as the flag pole for the Club's summer station in Newport, Rhode Island.  Replicas  The first replica of America was built by Goudy & Stevens Shipyard in Boothbay, Maine, and launched in 1967. She was built for Rudolph Schaefer, Jr., owner of F. & M. Schaefer Brewing Co. Construction was supervised by her first skipper, Newfoundland born Capt. Lester G. Hollett. A second replica of America was built in 1995 by Scarano Boatbuilding of Albany, NY for Ray Giovanni and was operated by him for commercial events until his death. It had several modifications from the original design including widening the beam by 4 feet to accommodate interior layouts. The original design had only one lantern (skylight) so three were added to bring light into the interior of the yacht. The yacht spent several years in Key West Florida and now operates whale watching and racing tours out of San Diego. She was exhibited in June 2011 in San Francisco Bay in concert with exploratory preparations by the Oracle Racing team for the 2013 America's Cup race, to be held within the bay. She was subsequently owned by Troy Sears's company Next Level Sailing, and sailed around the world as an official licensed partner for the America's Cup Tour. A third replica was built in Varna, Bulgaria in 2005. Christened Skythia, the boat's home port later was Rostock, Germany, where she was used for commercial charter.

This topic is typically indexed under the larger rubric of 'Ecological (or Environmental) Psychology'. However, the notion of behavior setting is offered here in more detail and with more specificity than is found in the larger entry under 'Ecological Psychology' or 'Environmental Psychology'. There has been a tendency in the social sciences generally to polarize arguments about consciousness, identity, behavior, and culture around either the mind existing 'in the head' or the mind being an artifact of social interaction. 'Mind'‚Äîin the sense used here‚Äîis understood as the motivation for behavior. Evidence indicates that both of these 'facts' are accurate. One of the problems social scientists have is understanding this paradox. Behavior settings are mediating structures that help explain the relationship between the dynamic behavior of individuals and stable social structure. Social scientist Roger Barker first developed this theoretical framework in the late 1940s. Behavior settings also may serve as a bridge between the foundational work of Humberto Maturana & Francisco Varela on Autopoiesis and the insights developed in American Pragmatism and Continental Activity Theory. A behavior setting exists at the interface between the standing patterns of behavior and the milieu (environment), wherein the behavior is happening in the 'milieu', and the 'milieu' in some sense \\"matches\\" the 'behavior'. In technical parlance, the \\"behavior-milieu interface\\" is called the synomorph, and the 'milieu' is said to be circumjacent and 'synomorphic' to the 'behavior'. In a dentist's office, for example, \\"patients get their cavities filled\\". This is the standing pattern (the behavior/milieu part or 'synomorph') because we are in the office (the 'milieu' surrounds us, i.e. 'circumjacent') and the pieces of the 'milieu' 'fit' the standing pattern (the drill is meant to fit in my mouth and drill my tooth, i.e. 'synomorphic' with the 'behavior'). Further, to be considered a 'behavior setting', these 'behavior/milieu parts' or 'synomorphs' must have a specific degree of interdependence that is greater than their interdependence with other parts of other settings. There is an empirical test that can determine the relative robustness of behavior settings, depending on the index of interdependence between and among specific standing patterns of behavior. By itself, a standing pattern of behavior is meaningless; it would be like watching a person pretending to go to the dentist's office and having a cavity filled. Also, a dentist's office without patients (or the possibility of patients) would be a meaningless artifact. So, a behavior setting is a self-referenced (internally interdependent and self-defined) entity that consists of one or more standing patterns of behavior. Just as the standing pattern is synomorphic with the artifacts in the milieu, so are standing patterns synomorphic with other standing patterns in the behavior setting. We see in the eminent ecological psychologist, Roger G. Barker‚Äôs conception, an elegant and stable view of the nested interrelationships that exist within our common experience. The pieces fit, and in their fitting we see the larger structure-in-a-context that is necessary for making claims about development, causality, or purpose. Ecological units \\"Ecological units\\" exist at the interface between the ecological environment and certain practice of molar behavior. These units exist in the physiological, social, psychological, and behavioral realms and share three common attributes: * they are self- generated, as opposed to resulting from the observer‚Äôs or researchers interest or manipulation; * they have a time-space locus; and * they have a boundary separating the internal pattern of the unit from the external pattern of surround. An ecological unit is a composite of an 'environment piece' and a 'behavior piece'. They are hybrid artifacts that exist as quasi-objective entities, much like Searle‚Äôs \\"observer-relative features of the world\\" (Searle, 1995). An example that Barker (1968) uses (p.11) is a road--a road is a track (physical feature) used for travelling or carrying goods (expression of 'molar behavior'). The coupling of a molar behavior to an environmental feature (affordance) is the mechanism through which the reciprocal relations between different levels of nested or related phenomena occur. The ecological unit is the foundation for the concept of a 'behavior setting' which was defined above. More generally, it seems that this notion captures the relationship of any organism to its niche and is captured by Reed (1996) in his discussion of the 'affordance'. Barker also develops a useful analogy for conceptualizing this relation, as well as preparing readers for later claims about behavior settings. He observes that 'molar behavior' is to the 'ecological environment', just as 'visual perception' is to 'light'; i.e. in order to understand visual perception, you have to understand light, independent from visual perception. If we were only to look at the eye-optic channel at the instant that light hit the receptor surface, we would know nothing of depth of field, focus, or perspective. The behavior setting concept could be very useful in the field of architectural programming, architectural design, as well as in urban planning and design. It is the very challenge for behavior setting theory today to be used in those fields: architects and behavioral scientists still are not in full contact in design and research issues. The kind of ecological unity devised by Roger Barker connects strongly and consistently behavior and physical features of ordinary - and those not- so-ordinary settings in universities, labs, hospitals, etc. Surveying a behavior setting According to Barker (1968), conducting a behavior setting survey consists of the measurement of eleven key descriptive attributes: * Occurrence * Duration * Population * Occupancy Time * Penetration * Action Patterns * Behavior Mechanisms * Richness * Pressure * Welfare * Local Autonomy There are two temporal attributes: Occurrence (O), the number of days in a year the behavior setting is capable of occurring, and Duration (D), the number of hours the behavior setting functions during a year. Population (P) is the number of different persons who inhabit the behavior setting during the year. These three basic attributes allow for a calculation of Occupancy Time (OT), the number of person-hours spent in the behavior setting. It is the product of the occurrences (O), the average number of inhabitants per occurrence (P/O), and the average duration per occurrence (D/O). Penetration (Pe) is the degree to which an inhabitant is involved in the setting and consists of six incremental zones, ranging from onlooker to leader. Using these divisions, the average depth of penetration can be determined for population subgroups (e.g., frequency of minority students being leaders in a club). Action Patterns (AP) are the functional attributes of the patterns of behavior (e.g., religion, education, and recreation). For each action variable, researchers note the activity's frequency (participation subscale), its production of materials for use in another setting (supply subscale), and whether the activity is evaluated (appreciation subscale). Behavior Mechanisms (BM) are the modalities through which behavior is implemented in the setting, such as gross motor activity, talking, or thinking. Researchers note each mechanism's frequency (participation subscale), the speed of the behavior (tempo subscale), and the expenditure of energy (intensity subscale). Richness is a composite measure of the variety of behavior within the setting. It is computed from the prior attributes using the following formula: (‚àëPe + ‚àëAP + ‚àëBM)OT/100 Pressure is the degree to which external forces act upon a person to approach/enter or avoid/withdraw from the setting. For example, a setting can be required (a child is for a class at school), invited (a child welcomed to a Sunday School class), or prohibited (a child is excluded from a bar). Welfare is the relevance of the setting to a particular group of inhabitants; that is, whether the group is served by the setting, whether the group serves others in the setting, or whether the setting instigates and supports other settings relevant to the group. Finally, the Local Autonomy of the behavior setting is the geographic level at which the setting's operations are determined (e.g., town, district, county, state).

The events resulted in early federal elections in the same year. Background Following the 1999 elections, the FP√ñ became part of a coalition government led by √ñVP leader Wolfgang Sch√ºssel, despite the FP√ñ having garnered the larger number of votes. During the summer of 2002, tension rose within the FP√ñ, following losses in several local elections. J√∂rg Haider, former FP√ñ leader and still Landeshauptmann of Carinthia, called for changes in government policy to reinvigorate the party's popularity, especially a tax reform. However, such a reform was out of reach in view of the catastrophic flood of August 2002. Events at Knittelfeld On September 7, a party meeting was held at Knittelfeld, but the party chair and Vice Chancellor of Austria at that time, Susanne Riess-Passer, was not present. Most of the functionaries attending represented the opposition within the FP√ñ of its traditional nationalist right wing. The key symbolic moment of the meeting was a public tearing of a compromise paper between Riess-Passer and Haider by the Carinthian delegate Scheuch (some witnesses report that Haider instructed Scheuch to publicly tear the paper, so even though it was Scheuch who actually tore the paper up, it was Haider in reality who was engaging in the destruction of the accord). The following day, Riess-Passer, Minister of Finance Karl-Heinz Grasser (who was later reappointed in this position by the √ñVP) and the chairman of the FP√ñ parliamentary club, Peter Westenthaler, announced their resignation, as did some other relatively pragmatic functionaries. Chancellor Wolfgang Sch√ºssel then renounced the coalition pact, which led to early elections being called, where the FP√ñ lost approximately two thirds of its voters of 1999 and fell from 26.9% of the public vote to 10.0%. Symbolic meaning Since that time in the Austrian media the term \\"Knittelfelder\\" has been used to refer to party rebels in the FP√ñ. You can also refer simply to \\"Knittelfeld\\" to refer to the events of the congress.  Aftermath  The coalition between √ñVP and FP√ñ was renewed after the elections in spite of the FP√ñ's weak showing at the polls. As the FP√ñ continued to lose even more dramatically in subsequent local and also the 2004 European elections, tensions did not subside. In April 2005, J√∂rg Haider founded the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZ√ñ), a new party, this time with the more pragmatic wing of the party, including all current FP√ñ members of the federal government and most of the FP√ñ's parliamentary representatives. Since then the BZ√ñ obtained 4.1% of the vote in the 2006 general election and got 7 seats in the National Council. The FP√ñ rose from 10% to 11% in that election. Since then the FP√ñ grew again, receiving 10.5% in the 2008 Lower Austria \\"Landtag\\" (provincial) election, more than doubling its 2003 result (4.5%). The BZ√ñ also participated in the Lower Austria election, but received only 0.72%, failing to pass the 4% threshold.

The film stars the voices of Daws Butler, Don Messick, Julie Bennett, Mel Blanc, and J. Pat O'Malley. Based upon Hanna-Barbera's syndicated animated television show The Yogi Bear Show, Hey There, It's Yogi Bear! was the first theatrical feature produced by Hanna-Barbera, and the first feature-length theatrical animated film based on a television program. In keeping with the limited animation of the television series, the film was not fully animated, but did contain more detailed animation work than the show. Plot Boo-Boo Bear wakes up from winter hibernation, excited about the new Spring. Then Yogi Bear wakes up, his only interest finding some food to eat. Cindy Bear unsuccessfully tries to woo Yogi. After Ranger Smith thwarts Yogi's latest attempts to grab some food, Yogi gets angry and convinces the Ranger to transfer him out of Jellystone National Park. Smith prepares Yogi to be sent over to the San Diego Zoo along with an identification tag. Yogi first says goodbye to everything, but tricks another bear named Corn Pone into going to California instead of him and Boo-Boo and Cindy remain unaware of this, thinking Yogi has departed for good. Soon, Yogi is stealing food from all over the park under the alter ego \\"The Brown Phantom\\", but Smith believes it is another bear. He threatens whoever it is to be sent to the zoo. Cindy, wishing to be with Yogi at the zoo, angers Smith into mistakenly sending her away. However, she gets sent to the St. Louis Zoo instead, as the San Diego Zoo does not need any more bears. When she realizes her true destination, she gets very sad, crying since she knows she would be far from Yogi now. Late that night, Cindy falls out of the train and becomes lost. A traveling circus is looking for a great act to raise their ratings, when suddenly, their dog runs off and scares Cindy into walking on the telephone wires, the perfect opportunity for the circus. Yogi has recently missed Boo-Boo and, above all, Cindy. Yogi goes to Ranger Smith and hears about her disappearance. Soon, Yogi and Boo-Boo escape from Jellystone to find Cindy. Meanwhile, Ranger Smith decides to let them find their way home to avoid trouble with the Park Commissioner. After an extensive travel, Yogi and Boo-Boo locate Cindy, who is being kept a prisoner for the greedy circus manager's nest egg. As Yogi confronts the manager, he is made to join the circus, too. Boo-Boo releases Yogi and Cindy and they make their exit. As they make their way home, they crash a barnyard party, somehow escaping afloat a river with the barn's door. Then, while Cindy & Yogi dream about a honeymoon in Venice, they find themselves suddenly being chased and hunted by the police, as they somehow became fugitives, but make their escape. They hitch a ride, but find themselves in the middle of a busy city (later revealed to be New York City) and make a run from the police to the top of a hotel and across to a high rise under construction. The next morning, Ranger Smith sees the three bears on television and decides to pick them up in a helicopter. All the commotions have made great publicity for Jellystone and Ranger Smith gets promoted to Chief Ranger by the Park Commissioner.

Cartoons storyman Warren Foster. Another Warner Cartoons alumnus, Friz Freleng, served as story supervisor.Barrier, Michael (1999). Hollywood Cartoons. New York: Oxford University Press. Pg. 562-563. . When the Warner Bros. Cartoons studio closed in May 1963, several of its animators, including Gerry Chiniquy and Ken Harris, also joined Hanna-Barbera to work on this film. Release and reception A review from the May 27, 1964 issue of Variety pointed out that the scarcity of theatrically released feature animated films made Hey There, It's Yogi Bear! highly marketable. The review called the film \\"artistically accomplished in all departments\\". The review commented that the script was a bit redundant, but that the songs were \\"pleasant, if not especially distinguished\\". After its 1964 release, the film was reissued on January 17, 1986, as part of Atlantic Releasing Corporation's short-lived Clubhouse Pictures label. Home media The film was released on VHS a few times in the United States by Paramount Home Video, KVC Home Video, and GoodTimes Home Video respectively in the 1980s and 1993. These releases use the 1986 Clubhouse Pictures reissue version, but it is not known if it contains the Columbia references. In 2000, Warner Home Video included this film on its VHS Bumper Collections (with several other TV shows) in Australia. This release also lacks the original Columbia Pictures card and credit references. On December 2, 2008, Warner Home Video released the film on DVD in North America. However, like a concurrent DVD release of another Hanna-Barbera feature, The Man Called Flintstone, this release alters the opening of the film by removing the Columbia Pictures logo and its credit references. Unlike the former, it is presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen (both films were animated in 1.33:1 and matted to 1.85:1 for theaters). A R2 DVD was released in the UK on January 31, 2011, and is also presented in 1.78:1.

More than fifty editions (including \\"reprintings\\") have been published, making the novel the most widely sold novel in the history of Chilean literature, with more than a million copies sold.Lafourcades's official site It was written at a conflictive time in Chile's history (events leading into the election of Salvador Allende as President) and it was a sentimental time in world popular culture (events such as rock concerts and drug use). Most critics saw the novel as a knee-jerk response to Erich Segal's Love Story. A New York Times No. 1 bestseller, Segal's book became the top selling work of fiction for all of 1970 in the United States, and was translated into more than 20 languages worldwide. The motion picture of the same name was the number one box office attraction of 1971. Thus most media comments in Santiago called Lafourcade's novel \\"the Chilean love story.\\" Lafourcade's marriage with Maria Luisa Se√±oret had ended three years earlier, and he reportedly wrote the novel inspired by his later pareja, about whom he remained quite secretive. A film based on the novel was made in 1973 by Ra√∫l Ruiz, which was at one time believed lost forever, but a print was later found in the vaults of ChileFilms. Music for the film was written and performed by Los Jaivas. A translation to Portuguese was published in Brazil, but a translation to English by Joel Hancock of the University of Utah has remained unpublished. The story is of a working class naive teenage girl (Mar√≠a = Palomita) who meets a posh boy (Juan Carlos) in the Piedra Roja music festival. The love story goes wrong because of the class differences between the characters, and the naivet√© of the girl who believes in the Cinderella story of a poor girl rescued by a rich and handsome prince. Juan Carlos is involved in extreme right-wing terrorism, and needs to leave the country in a hurry, leaving Palomita behind. The political tension that would later culminate in the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat is brilliantly observed and described by writer Lafourcade. Film adaptation The novel was adapted into the 1973 film Little White Dove by Chilean director Ra√∫l Ruiz. Music It is also the name of a popular tango from 1929 by Anselmo Aieto.

Background and early life William Frederick Webb was born in Sussex in March 1829, one of four children of Frederick Webb and Mary Shiel. His father, who died on 4 February 1846, was an illegitimate son of Sir John Webb, having a brother John who had been declared a lunatic. John Webb, who stood to inherit an income from the estates of Sir John, was at that time under medical care, in France, and had an illegitimate daughter. A court case began in April 1846. Ultimately, William Frederick Webb inherited estates in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and County Durham, making him a wealthy man. Webb was educated at Eton College and later joined the army, becoming a Captain in the 17th Lancers. Later life After the Lion Hunt, 1857 painting by Alfred Corbould, showing William Frederick Webb and Captain William Codrington A big-game hunter, particularly of rhinoceros, Webb spent time in Africa with a friend, Captain William Codrington. In 1851 Webb became ill with fever and they summoned the explorer David Livingstone to assist. Webb recovered and came to know the Livingstones at Kolobeng Mission. In 1860, Webb, now married, resided at Pepper Hall in Yorkshire. He purchased Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire from Thomas Wildman, a deal completed in 1861, for ¬£147,000. Another potential purchaser had been Queen Victoria. He moved his family into the Abbey, and set about improvements, installing heating and gas lighting and also redecorating the old chapel. His wife sought out memorabilia of Lord Byron, who had owned it. Webb's hunting trophies remain in Newstead today: the tusks, skins and heads of the animals he killed while in Africa. Livingstone made regular trips to Newstead, sometimes staying for months. Newstead Abbey today Webb was also a magistrate. In 1865 he became High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire. In 1889, Emilia Jane Webb became ill with tuberculosis and journeyed to Africa in October that year, in hope that the warm climate would help her recovery. On 28 December 1889, she died, aged 63. She was buried in the cemetery of St John's church, Wynberg, Cape Town, South Africa.The white marble grave is still in good condition as at 2009 and states her age at death as being 55. It features a design on it that reflects motifs seen throughout Newstead Abbey. Ten years later, in 1899, Webb contracted laryngitis while in Africa. He died from it and is buried at Luxor in Egypt. When Webb died, Newstead Abbey was passed through each of his surviving children until Webb's grandson Charles Ian Fraser sold it to Sir Julien Cahn, who then gave it to Nottingham City Council in 1931. Family On 15 July 1857, Webb married Emilia Jane, daughter of Thomas Mills Goodlake of Wadley House at Littleworth in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), and sister of Gerald Goodlake VC. Together they had seven children: * Wilfred Webb (1858) (died at three months) * Augusta Zelia Webb (1859), writer, married Philip Affleck Fraser. * Geraldine Katharine Webb (1860), married Herbert Chermside. * Ethel Mary Webb (1863) * Mabel C.

College career During his time playing for LSU, Davey threw for 4,415 yards and 29 touchdowns. As a freshman (1998), Davey was a backup to Herb Tyler and Craig Nall, and saw no playing time. As a sophomore (1999) and a junior (2000), Davey shared the QB position with Josh Booty. As a sophomore, Davey led unranked LSU to a 35‚Äì10 victory over #17 Arkansas (televised by CBS), passing for 224 yards and three touchdowns. As a junior Davey's led unranked LSU to a 38‚Äì31 OT victory over #11 Tennessee (televised by ESPN), passing for 318 yards and 4 touchdowns. As a senior (2001), Davey had the QB position to himself (Booty had gone to the National Football League); and he led LSU to its first Top 10 finish since 1987 and its first SEC Championship since 1988. During the regular season, Davey passed for 3,347 yards, becoming the first QB in LSU history to pass for over 3,000 yards in a season. Davey also beat Peyton Manning's junior-year performance at Tennessee in 1996 (Manning threw for 3,287 yards that year), which was 9th best in SEC history. With 3,351 yards of total offense (3,347 yards passing, 4 yards rushing) on 405 plays, Davey had an average of 8.27 yards of total offense per play, making him the 5th person in SEC history to finish a season with more than 8.0 yards of total offense per play (minimum 300 plays). Davey's best performance during the regular season was at Alabama (televised by CBS), when he passed for 528 yards (becoming the first LSU quarterback to throw for more than 500 yards in a game). By passing for 528 yards against Alabama, Davey also became #3 in SEC history for most passing yards in a game (beating Peyton Manning's 523 passing yards against Kentucky in 1997). Davey's major victories included unranked LSU's 41‚Äì38 victory over #24 Arkansas (televised by CBS) and #22 LSU's 27‚Äì14 victory over #25 Auburn (televised by ESPN). Against Arkansas, Davey threw for 359 yards and 3 touchdowns. Against Auburn, Davey threw for 245 yards and 1 touchdown. In the SEC Championship game against #2 Tennessee, Davey had 84 yards passing before having to sit the rest of the game out due to injury. Davey capped off his senior season by passing for 444 yards and 3 touchdowns in the Sugar Bowl against #7 Illinois (televised by ABC), leading the Tigers to a 47‚Äì34 victory. At that time, the only other LSU quarterback who had ever thrown for more than 400 yards in a game was Tommy Hodson in 1989. For his performance, Davey was named Sugar Bowl MVP. For this performance, Davey was enshrined in LSU's Hall of Fame. As a result of his performance during the 2001 season, Davey was voted to the second team of the All-SEC Team. Professional career Davey was rated the fourth best quarterback in the 2002 NFL Draft by NFLDraftScout.com. =National Football League= Davey was selected by the New England Patriots coming off a record- setting career at LSU, taken in the 4th Round as the 117th pick of the 2002 NFL Draft (Davey was the 6th quarterback taken in the 2002 NFL Draft, behind David Carr of Fresno State, Joey Harrington of Oregon, Patrick Ramsey of Tulane, Josh McCown of Sam Houston, and David Garrard of East Carolina). While still with the Patriots, Davey showed potential in 2004 playing in NFL Europe. He had a record-setting season, was named \\"Player of the Year\\", and won the World Bowl with the Berlin Thunder. Upon returning to the Patriots, he lost his back-up job to Doug Flutie and lost the third-string slot, losing that job to 7th-round pick Matt Cassel. He was subsequently released by the Patriots on August 29, 2005. On September 28, 2005, Davey signed with the Arizona Cardinals as the quarterback behind Kurt Warner, Josh McCown, and John Navarre. On August 28, 2006, he was released. =Arena Football League= Davey was signed by the Arena Football League's New York Dragons on October 26, 2006. He played in his first career game on March 4, 2007, replacing an ineffective Leon Murray at the start of the second half. He finished the game having completed 12-of-21 passes for 131 yards, one touchdown and two INTs. Following this game, he was named the Dragons' starting quarterback. Davey was waived in 2008, and signed a contract with the Cleveland Gladiators on April 3 of that year.Gladiators add former NFL quarterback He was released when the league went bankrupt. After sitting out for five seasons, Davey returned in 2013 as a member of the San Antonio Talons. Personal life Davey is the cousin of football player Trevon Coley.

These stories follow an almost dreamtime-like description of humans and other animal species living completely harmoniously. The animals are depicted as demi-gods, and are always referred to as proper singular nouns (for instance, \\"Raccoon\\" and \\"Raven\\"). There are other similar stories including how Raccoon got the rings on his tail and why Puma hides in the forest so much. Tlingit box drum with painted Blackfish motif, 19th c. Blackfish is arguably the most important creature in Haida culture. Blackfish is also highly revered in Tlingit culture because of his apparent affinity with humans. He represents an extremely powerful force of nature, deadly and terrifying to every creature except man, whom he is said to look after. The story describes why this is so. There are many variations to the tale, some considerably more brutal than others, and the exact details vary widely according to the storyteller, but the main theme of the story is always the same. Story The tale begins with a young warrior, Natsilane, who is destined to become chief due to his skills, intelligence and generally pleasant demeanour. His brothers are extremely jealous of this, and plot to depose him. The brothers take Natsilane out to sea fishing, taking him further away from the shore than they have ever been before. As he becomes concerned, the brothers throw Natsilane overboard and row away. As Natsilane is beginning to drown, he is found and rescued by Sea otter, who floats him to a large island saying it is too far back to the mainland for Sea otter to help him back. Instead, he promises to look after Natsilane and shows him the best hunting and fishing grounds. Once Natsilane is settled on his new island, alone, Sea otter confers one last gift to him, a pouch of seeds, and instructs Natsilane to sow them. Natsilane does so, and over the years the seeds grow into a bewildering array of tree species, all of which are now native in the Pacific Northwest. Natsilane uses wood from the trees to carve tools and a boat. Haida grave totem with Blackfish motif, 19th c. In appreciation of Sea otter, Natsilane then tries to carve a new totem. He tries all the trees, but settles on using a large yellow cedar tree and carves a huge fish from it, and leaves it on the shore for Sea otter to find. The next morning, when Natsilane goes down to the shore, the fish carving is gone and in the bay is swimming Blackfish, the first killer whale. With a boat and supplies, Natsilane travels back to his home, guided by Blackfish. When he arrives, he finds his brothers out fishing again, squabbling. He orders Blackfish to destroy their boat and drown his brothers, which it does immediately. When it returns, Natsilane orders that from this day forward it must never harm a human again, and that when it finds a human in trouble at sea it must help him. He then sends the whale off to sea. Natsilane returns to his village, which had been terrorised by his brothers, and becomes chief. =Variant= In another variant, Natsilane has married into a distant village; he is a skilled carver and hunter, and it is the jealous older brothers of Natsilane's wife who betray him. During a sea lion hunt, Natsilane leaps onto a rocky island, wounding a sea lion with his spear; rather than help, the older brothers-in-law fail to follow and maroon him on the deserted island, despite the protestation of the youngest brother-in-law, who idolizes Natsilane. As night falls, without a way to start a fire, Natsilane begins to freeze until he is rescued by a sea lion in the shape of a man. It turns out his rescuer has been sent by the King of the sea lions, asking Natsilane to help save his son; Natsilane recognizes the king's son as the one he had wounded during the hunt. He is able to pull the broken spear from the sea lion's side, allowing the infected wound to drain. Overjoyed, the king safely conducts Natsilane back to his adopted village, where he briefly reunites with his wife, who had presumed him drowned after her brothers returned from the hunt without him. She brings his carving tools for him, and he takes them with him into the surrounding forest to camp in secret and plot his vengeance. He first carves a Blackfish from spruce; testing the carving in a series of four pools leading to the cove, it briefly floats, then sinks in the first pool. The second carving is from red cedar; it leaps from the first pool to the second, but shortly thereafter sinks like the spruce carving. The third carving is from hemlock, which leaps from the first and second pools, but sinks in the third. His fourth carving, from yellow cedar, swims out to sea after successfully navigating the pools. Natsilane praises the King of the sea lions and instructs the yellow cedar Blackfish to sink the canoe of his brothers-in-law, who have set out on another hunt, but to spare the youngest. After successfully sinking the canoe, Blackfish returns to Natsilane, who instructs him to never hurt another human; the youngest brother-in-law washes up ashore in the cove and eventually succeeds his father to become village chief. As for Natsilane, he is never seen again, although some claim to have seen him riding two killer whales far out to sea. Interpretation The story has obvious themes of self-preservation, a reliance on the earth and karma, but it must be interpreted in a Tlingit mindset, where life and animals are equal (if not more worthy) to humans. The Blackfish therefore represents the force of nature that can be achieved when nature and humankind are joined (whilst the carving is created by Natsilane, it is assumed Sea otter brings it to life). The rather brutal ending should not be misinterpreted either: this is a happy ending, where good and the natural world (Natsilane and the Blackfish) have prevailed over man alone (the brothers). In the wild, orcas do not attack people; it is not clear if this is due to orca societal norms or because humans are not part of their regular diet. The only known orca-related human fatalities have all occurred at marine mammal parks where orcas were held in captivity. In popular culture *A minor human character in the animated Disney series Gargoyles is named Natsilane. *A variant of the Natsilane story (captioned as 'Natsaclane') is recounted in the 1993 film Free Willy (timemark: 47 minutes).

The archaeological site of ancient Vitcos, called Rosaspata, is in the Vilcabamba District of La Convenci√≥n Province, Cusco Region in Peru. The ruins are on a ridge overlooking the junction of two small rivers and the village of Pucyura. The Incas had occupied Vilcabamba, the region in which Vitcos is located, about 1450 CE, establishing major centers at Machu Picchu, Choquequirao, Vitcos, and Vilcabamba.Bauer, Brian S., Halac- Higashimori, Madeleine, and Cantarutti, Gabriel E. (2013), Voices from Vilcabamba: Accounts Chronicling the Fall of the Inca Empire, Boulder: University Press of Colorado, p. 4. Downloaded from Project Muse. Vitcos was often the residence of the rulers of the Neo-Inca state until the Spanish conquest of this last stronghold of the Incas in 1572. The location of Vitcos was later forgotten until 1911 when explorer Hiram Bingham identified the ruins known to local Peruvians as Rosaspata () as ancient Vitcos.Hemming, John (1970), The Conquest of the Incas, New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc., pp. 484-485 The ruins of the Inca ceremonial center of √ëusta Hispana (the \\"White Rock\\") are about south of the Inca palace that is the outstanding feature of Rosaspata.

Vitcos (Rosaspata) and other important places are circled. 250px 250px The Vilcabama region in which Vitcos is located is extremely rugged, occupying the north-eastern slopes of the Andes and sloping down to the Amazon Basin. The terrain includes snow-covered mountains, forest, lowland jungle, and rivers running through deep canyons. Access and transportation within the area was difficult and would hinder Spanish efforts to destroy the last outposts of the Inca Empire.Hemming, pp. 255, p. 331-332; Google Earth The Incas had occupied the Vilcabamba region since about 1450 CE, establishing major centers at Vitcos, Machu Picchu, Choquequirao, and Vilcabamba.Bauer, et al, (2013), Brian S., p. 4. Downloaded from Project Muse. Thus, the Incas were familiar with the region when Inca emperor, Manco Inca Yupanqui, won the Battle of Ollantaytambo against the Spanish and their Indian allies in January 1537. Despite the victory Manco was under intense pressure from the Spanish. He decided that Ollantaytambo was too close to Cusco, which was controlled by the Spanish, so he withdrew westward to Vitcos. Almagro sent his lieutenant Rodrigo Org√≥√±ez in pursuit with 300 Spaniards and numerous Indian allies. In July 1537, Orgo√±ez occupied and sacked Vitcos taking many prisoners, but Manco escaped.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 222‚Äì225. Manco Inca survived another Spain raid in 1539 by Gonzalo Pizarro, 300 Spanish soldiers, and Indian allies. The Spanish and the Incas fought a battle at Huayna Pukara (Huayna Fort), west of Vitcos. Several Spaniards and Indians were killed, but Manco again escaped. Pizarro stayed in the region for more than two months searching for Manco unsuccessfully, but capturing Manco's principal wife. The Spaniards wrote of the region that \\"great resources are needed to undertake a penetration of that land. It can be done only with very heavy expenditure.\\" As the two Spanish raids demonstrated, Vitcos was accessible to the Spanish and Manco developed Vilcabamba as a more remote refuge.Bauer et al (2013), pp. 5-6; Hemming, p. 255Bauer et al (2013), p. 4.. However, throughout the decades that the Neo-Inca state survived, Vitcos would continue to be the residence of many royal Incas and the site of many religious ceremonies, especially at the nearby shrine of √ëusta Hisp'ana (Yurak Rumi, also called the \\"White Rock).Bauer, Brian S., Araoz Silva, Miriam Dayde, Burr, George s. (2012), \\"The Destruction of the Yurak Rumi Shrine (Vilcabamba, Cusco Department), Andean Past 10, p. 196 The Incas preferred Vitcos as a place of residence because of its higher elevation () than Vilcabamba (). Vitcos has a cooler climate and the environment was more similar to the highland home of the Incas.MacQuarrie, Kim (2007), The Last Days of the Incas, New York: Simon and Schuster, pp. 307-308 Spanish attempts to conquer Vilcabamba floundered because of internecine warfare among the Spaniards. A group of seven Spanish renegades, included the assassin of Francisco Pizzaro, took refuge with Manco Inca. In 1544, they murdered him in Vitcos in an attempt to win back favor with the Spanish crown. The Spanish fled, but Manco's guards pursued and killed them. The decades following Manco's death were mostly peaceful as the Incas survived in the remote remnant of their empire while the Spanish were consolidating their conquest elsewhere.Hemming, pp. 277-279 In 1570, relations between the Spanish and the Incas were sufficiently friendly that two Roman Catholic friars were allowed to settle in villages near Vitcos. The friars repaid their hosts by leading their congregation in an attack which damaged the shrine of ≈áusta Hisp'ana. One of the priests was expelled. The other one was killed by the Incas, accused of killing by poison Emperor Titu Cusi Yupanqui, son of Manco Inca. Titu Cusi's brother Tupac Amaru became emperor. MacQuarrie pp. 360-365 Tupac Amaru was much more hostile to the Spaniards than Tuti Cusi and his supporters killed an envoy sent by Vicerory Francisco de Toledo. In response Toledo ordered the invasion of Vilcabamba by two armies totaling more than 300 Spaniards and 2,000 allies, including 500 Ca√±ari, long-time allies of the Spaniards. In June 1572, the Spanish force was successful, capturing Vitcos, Vilcabamba, and Emperor Tupac Amaru and ending the Neo Inca state.Hemming, pg. 421-440 left Rediscovery The location of Vitcos was forgotten in the centuries following the conquest of the Incas. In his 1911 expedition Hiram Bingham III was searching for Vilcabamba, the last capital of the Incas. Following descriptions left by various conquistadors, he came upon a site called \\"Rosaspata\\" by local villagers. Through the same descriptions that had led him there, he was able to determine that he was in fact at the palace of Vitcos and oracle of √ëusta Hisp'ana, also called Chuqip'allta. After cursory mapping of both sites he continued on in search of the last city of the Inca. Knowing roughly where in relation to Vitcos he might find Vilcabamba, he continued on what he believed was, and actually was, the road to his goal, and he both rediscovered and correctly identified both Vitcos and Vilcabamba. In the 1980s, Vincent Lee's work in the Vilcabamba led to his finding and description of more than thirty buildings and engineered structures on the eastern flank of the hill between Vitcos and Chuquipalta. Amongst these are kalankas (meeting houses), several qollqa (storehouses), and a large usnu (religious observation platform), as well as terraces and built-up trails.Lee, Vincent R. (2000). Forgotten Vilcabamba: Final Stronghold of the Incas. Sixpac Manco Publications. The Rosaspata ruin Vitcos stands on the northern side of the hill between the modern villages Huancacalle and Pucyara, and is the principal portion of a complex that covers the entire hill and portions of the valleys to the south and east. South of the hill there is √ëusta Hispana, also called Chuqip'allta and the White Rock, a giant carved stone said to have been an Inca oracle, and a series of terraces that stretch along the eastern side of the hill within the valley, which are believed to have been decorative or ceremonial gardens. The palace itself consists of two groups of buildings. The upper group is made up of eight large rooms, arranged in four pairs of two rooms back to back, all joined by a common outer wall. The common wall has doors that lead to passages between the pairs. Each room has three doors to the exterior of the common wall, but no doors to either the room behind it of the passageways between the four pairs. Each pair of rooms had a common roof. To the north of the upper group is a terrace wall, below which is the lower group of buildings. This group is made up of a dozen or more buildings arranged around an open courtyard. The exact number of buildings in this group is unclear, as it is in considerably worse condition than the upper group. Bingham measured the royal residence as being 245 feet long by 43 feet wide, and stated, \\"There were no windows, but it was lighted by thirty doorways, fifteen in front and the same in back.\\" He went on to say, \\"It contained ten large rooms, besides three hallways running from front to rear.\\" The lintels were made of solid block of white granite. Opposite the long palace, Bingham measured a structure 78 feet long and 25 feet wide, \\"containing doors on both sides, no niches, and no evidence of careful workmanship.\\" Footnotes External links *Hiram Bingham's search for Vitcos *Peru Guide images of the area *St. Petersburg Times, \\"Empires of Mystery\\" *Images of Vitcos' reconstruction Category:Inca Category:Archaeological sites in Peru Category:Archaeological sites in Cusco Region Category:16th-century disestablishments in the Inca civilization Category:1911 archaeological discoveries Category:Ruins in Peru ","title":"Vitcos"},{"id":"2513217","text":"Valentines Park is a park, south of Gants Hill, it is the largest green space in the London Borough of Redbridge..

The park, including Valentines Mansion, is managed on behalf of Redbridge Council by Vision RCL, a registered charity. History Valentines Park was acquired in various purchases and gifts of land, starting in 1898 and culminating in the 1920s. =Cranbrook Estate= In 1899 the Cranbrook Estate, which now makes up an area in the west of the park, was about to be sold for housing. The Municipal Borough of Ilford had acquired its first section of parkland a year previously and was keen to enlarge its size as soon as land became available. Local officials believed that, unless an area of \\"relaxation and pleasure\\" was retained for the growing urban population, all traces of a rural Ilford could be lost. The park was opened in the same year under the name of Central Park. =Valentines Mansion= Valentines Mansion viewed from the back Valentines Mansion was built in 1696 for Lady Tillotson, the widow of John Tillotson, Archbishop of Canterbury. For twenty years until around 1780 it was the family home of Sir Charles Raymond who had considerable interests in the East India Company as a ship owner and later became a banker. The house remained a family house until Sarah Ingleby, its last inhabitant, died on 3 January 1906. Following the death of the mansion's owner the local council acquired the remainder of its grounds and expanded the park. =Cricket Grounds= County Cricket was first played at Valentine's Park in Ilford in 1922 and a pavilion was completed a year later after a Mrs Ingleby, who owned 136 acres of land surrounding it, donated the venue to Ilford CC.

After attending the gymnasium in Wels, Nelb√∂ck studied philosophy at the University of Vienna from 1925 on with Moritz Schlick, who was his doctoral advisor, and graduated as a Doctor of Philosophy on March 21, 1931, with the doctoral thesis \\"The Importance of Logic in Empirism and Positivism\\".Johann Nelboeck: Die Bedeutung der Logik im Empirismus und Positivismus. Dissertation, Vienna 1930. Twice Nelb√∂ck was sent to a mental hospital with the diagnosis of schizoid personality disorder. He had threatened to kill Schlick. On June 22, 1936, Nelb√∂ck shot Schlick in the chest, killing him on one of the central staircases of the University of Vienna. The substantiation of the judgment of the Provincial Court for Criminal Matters of Vienna (dated May 26, 1937) summed up: The court declared Nelb√∂ck to be fully compos mentis, he confessed to the act, was detained without any resistance, but was unrepentant. He used the judicial proceedings as a chance to present himself and his ideology in the public. A significant part of his defence was the claim that Schlick's anti-metaphysical philosophy had undermined his native moral restraints, a line of thought which Austrian Nazis, asserting Schlick's Jewish connections within the Vienna Circle, quickly developed and exploited. In another version of the events Nelb√∂ck covered all political causes up and claimed, that he was motivated by jealousy over his failed attachment to the female student Sylvia Borowicka, leading to a paranoid delusion about Schlick as his rival and persecutor. Nelb√∂ck was found guilty and sentenced, but in the event he became a distorted cause c√©l√®bre, around which crystallized the growing nationalist and anti-Jewish sentiments in the city. Although a German Protestant from minor Prussian nobility, Schlick was subsequently characterized in the press as a pivotal figure in disaffected Jewish circles, and the murder was applauded by Vienna's austrofascists. On May 26, 1937, Nelb√∂ck was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, but only two years later - after the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany in 1938 - asked for a pardon. In his application he pointed out \\"that by his act and the result elimination of a Jewish teacher who propagated doctrines alien and detrimental to the nation he rendered National Socialism a service and also suffered for National Socialism as a consequence of his act. Since the world-view, the rightness of which he recognized even then and out of which he committed his act, is now the ruling national ideology, he considers it a hardship if he still has to remain in a disadvantaged position because of an act which sprang from his world-view.\\" Because the Senior Public Prosecutor concluded that Nelb√∂ck's act was accompanied primarily by personal motives, Nelb√∂ck was only released on probation on October 11, 1938.Wolfgang L. Reiter: Die Vertreibung der j√ºdischen Intelligenz: Verdopplung eines Verlustes ‚Äì 1938/1945, S. 6, Fu√ünote 17. In: Internationale Mathematische Nachrichten, Nr. 187 (2001), 1‚Äì20. Online From 1938 on, Nelb√∂ck worked in the geological department of the wartime economic oil authority. When the period of probation ended in 1943, he worked as a technical employee in the Main Measurement Office. In 1951, Nelb√∂ck sued Victor Kraft, a member of the Vienna Circle, who had called Nelb√∂ck a \\"paranoid psychopath\\" in his (Kraft's) book Der Wiener Kreis.

LaPierre, (November 21, 1929 ‚Äì December 16, 2012) was a Canadian Senator, professor, broadcaster, journalist and author. He was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. Fluently bilingual, LaPierre was best known for having been co-host with Patrick Watson of the CBC's influential public affairs show This Hour Has Seven Days in the 1960s. After the show's much publicized cancellation, LaPierre moved to politics as a \\"star candidate\\" for the New Democratic Party in the 1968 federal election. The party was hoping that he would help achieve an electoral breakthrough in Quebec, but he came second in the riding of Lachine with 19.5% of the vote. He returned to teaching, broadcasting and writing until his appointment to the Senate in June 2001. As a member of the Liberal caucus, LaPierre was an outspoken supporter of Jean Chr√©tien against supporters of rival Paul Martin.  Early life and education  LaPierre was born in Lac-M√©gantic, Quebec, after which his family moved to Sherbrooke, Quebec, where he completed high school before entering the Paulist Fathers in Baltimore, Maryland, as a novitiate. After four years, he moved to St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto. He received a Bachelor of Arts (1955) from the University of Toronto (St. Michael's College), Master of Arts (1957) and Ph.D. in History (1962) from the University of Toronto. During those university years he was a part-time teacher at Upper Canada College in Toronto. He taught History at the College of Christ the King (now King's College), University of Western Ontario (1959‚Äì61); Loyola College, Montreal (now part of Concordia University) (1961‚Äì63); and McGill University (1963‚Äì78). In 1978, he moved to Vancouver to work in television but also taught briefly at Simon Fraser University. In 1960, he married Paula (Jo) Armstrong and they had two sons: Dominic born 1962 and Thomas born 1965. They were divorced in 1982. He had five grandchildren - Paige, Alex, Georgia, Toby and Owen LaPierre. He moved to Ottawa in 1990, continued to work in broadcasting and writing, and lived there until his death, in the later years, with his partner Harvey Slack. He wrote several popular histories including Quebec: A Tale of Love; Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the Romance of Canada; 1759: The Battle for Canada; Qu√©bec hier et aujourd'hui; and, The Apprenticeship of Canada, 1876‚Äì1914. He also wrote articles for The Financial Post, International Review, Canadian Forum and Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. He was an activist with EGALE, a lobby group for gay and lesbian rights, after coming out as gay in the late 1980s. He was Canada's first openly gay senator.  Death  Appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1994, he was cited as one of Canada's \\"most valuable political commentators and respected champions of social justice.\\" He died on December 16, 2012, aged 83.Laurier LaPierre ‚Äì Obituary. Ottawa Citizen, December 21, 2012. Retrieved December 22, 2012. LaPierre's ashes were scattered off the coast of British Columbia, as his will requested.

The Terminators franchise was owned by Jeff Parnell. The team office was based in Austin, and played their games in the Travis County Expo Center, known as \\"The Barn\\" for Terminators games. The team colors were: Purple, Teal, Black, Grey & White. On September 1, 1998, Texas announced Duane Duncum as its head coach for the Terminators' inaugural season. Duncum's resume included four years of professional football experience: Hamilton Tiger-Cats (CFL), 1991; Orlando Thunder (WLAF), 1992; San Antonio Force (AFL), 1993; and Dallas Texans (AFL), 1994. Prior to his professional career, Duncum was a standout linebacker at the University of Texas. The team held tryouts at Austin High School on October 17, 1998. The Terminators won a perfect 8-0 at home, 12-4 overall for the 1999 season.

Behind an opportunistic defensive effort, the Hammerheads held the Texas offense, the league's highest-scoring unit well below its regular-season average of 40.8 points per game. In doing so, Texas finished with just eight first downs and 144 yards of total offense. Aside from recording four turnovers (two fumble recoveries and two interceptions), Hawaii also held the regular-season champion Terminators scoreless for two quarters. Notable players The Terminators were stocked with a great deal of local talent and former stars of the University of Texas including: James Brown, Butch Hadnot, and Lance Gunn (who had signed but opted to work for Frito Lay instead.) The defense was led by Aaron Hamilton, who had 11.5 sacks on the season.  Terminators to skip the 2000 IPFL season  As posted on the official Texas Terminators website right after the 1999 IPFL Championship Game loss.... Texas Terminator fans, It is with great regret that I announce that the Texas Terminators Indoor Professional Football team will not be participating in the up coming IPFL 2000 season. We were looking forward to defending our regular season championship in pursuit of winning it all this year. Last season the Austin metro area fans and media rallied behind our franchise providing an Inaugural season that was second to none in the IPFL. Our games were well attended by football savvy fans and with their support we posted a perfect 8-0 home record. All of the teams in the IPFL knew they were in for a war when they entered \\"the Barn\\" as we referred to our home the \\"Travis County Exposition Center\\". It is that respect for our fans that have led me to forgo participating in the 2000 season. The Exposition Center is a wonderful facility and we were thankful for them allowing us the opportunity to play there. The facts sadly can not be ignored and the conditions were less than optimal for indoor football in July and August. The IPFL as a league will continue to grow as evidenced by the addition of Portland, Omaha, and Shreveport this year. The play of the Texas Terminators reaffirmed that Texas is the home of football. To the media, our fans and friends rest assured the Texas Terminators will a find suitable venue to continue bringing you the same \\"Wall-to-Wall\\" football excitement that you have come to expect from your team. WE'LL Be BACK! Thank you Jeff Parnell Texas Terminators owner However, neither Parnell nor the Terminators were ever heard from again publicly.

Origins  = 1910 = A left communist section, the Sinistra, emerged at the Italian Socialist Party's (PSI) Congress of Milan in opposition to what they perceived as \\"reformism\\" in the leadership of the party and the trade unions. The Sinistra strongly opposed the Italo-Turkish War, in attempting to demonstrate their belief in Proletarian internationalism and organized itself nationally as the Left Communist Faction at the Reggio Emilia Congress of 1912. A similar conflict broke out in the Socialist Youth Federation against alleged \\"reformists\\" by Sinistra. The Sinistra asserted that both the communist party and Young Federation were \\"organs of struggle\\". Amadeo Bordiga was a large influence on the party ideologically. = 1914 = At the time of World War I the Sinistra espoused revolutionary defeatism, a Leninist theory. = 1917 = At the outbreak of the October Revolution, the Sinistra aligned itself with Lenin and his ideology of Leninism, the first sign of what they thought would be an international revolution. ‚ÄúBolshevism, A Plant for Every Clime‚Äù, a piece written by party ideologist Bordiga, favorably spoke of the revolution. = 1919 = 1919 was seen as a \\"crucial year\\" by Left Communists due to the German and Hungarian revolutions, which they viewed as being part of a trend of world revolution that the great October socialist revolution began. In Italy, a polemic began between the Sinistra and Antonio Gramsci over the role of soviets in Italy. Sinistra then started an Abstentionist faction was founded in the PSI, due to Sinistra's left communist views in regards to participation in elections and trade unions. = 1920 = At the Second Congress of the Third International, the Sinistra opposed the Third International's structure, preferring an international party, as well as its requirement of democratic centralism. = 1921 = = 1923‚Äì1924 = After the arrest of Bordiga and many of the party‚Äôs leaders in early 1923, Sinistra was voted out by the party. Now led by Gramsci and Togliatti. The new majority within the party successfully opposed Sinistra and purged their remaining members. = 1926‚Äì1930 = = 1930‚Äì1940 = With Bordiga under continuous police surveillance and isolated in Naples, the Sinistra voted out of the party, its members largely disappeared as a result of migration to the west and no stable organization keeping them together.  History  In 1943, the Internationalist Communist Party was founded as Partito Comunista Internazionalista in Italy around Onorato Damen and Bruno Maffi. They opposed the anti fascist partisans that resisted the fascist mussolini government, leading to accusations of being german agents due to their opposition to anti fascism. Partito Comunista Internazionalista formed several federations, what they saw as leading ones being in Turin, Milan and Parma. It agitated in factories by forming \\"Internationalist Communist Factory Groups\\", advocating for the formation of workers' councils. In December 1945, Partito Comunista Internazionalista held its first national conference in Turin, now as a larger party. Bordiga was absent from this conference, since he did not become a member of the party until 1949, although he made individuals contributions to it. In the congress, the hints about the future split in the Party appeared. Disagreements crystallized with Damen and Stefanini on one hand and Maffi and Bordiga's absent support on the other on the question of the function of the party, on the union question, and on the question of parties participation in elections. Partito Comunista Internazionalista kept growing, claiming to possess 13 federations and 72 sections. Splits broke out in the party regarding achieving socialism through reform, approach to trade unions, and support for national liberation. In 1952, a majority supported Damen, who rejected any hope of conquering the unions and any support for national liberation. In 1952, there were two Partito Comunista Internazionalistas in Italy, both laying claim to Lenin and the Italian left. The party as led by Bordiga and Maffi soon started publishing Il Programma Comunista where the majority group held on to Prometeo and Battaglia Comunista. The party (publishing Il Programma Comunista) took the name International Communist Party soon after the split. In 1964, a new split gave its birth based on its opposition towards Bordiga's thesis presented in party meeting in Florence, which tried to define new criteria built on organic centralism. This new split got named as Rivoluzione Comunista (RC) and made its critique of party's programmatism and proposed to intervene more actively in the class. Until his death in 1970, Bordiga devoted himself to contributing to the task of reconstructing the theoretical and political basis of the Party. The \\"Fundamental Theses of the Party\\" (1951), \\"Considerations on the Organic Activity of the Party in a Situation which is Generally and Historically Unfavorable\\" (1965), \\"Theses on the Historic Duty, the Action and Structure of the World Communist Party\\" (1965), and \\"Supplementary Theses\\" (1966) gave the party its theoretical, political, and organizational structure. In late 1973 the ICP underwent a serious split, which led to the militants (mostly based in Florence) reorganizing and moving forward, publishing Il Partito Comunista. The International Communist Party continues publishing in several languages, including the English press \\"Communist Left\\". Meanwhile, in 1982, the Il Programma ICP was decimated by further splits within their ranks, particularly in France and Italy. From one of these splits came a new organization under the ICP banner which publishes Il Comunista. There have been several tendencies and organizations over the years which have more or less claimed their heritage to International (Italian) Communist Left or directly to the original International Communist Party. One of these tendencies, which started in 1981, is a group (expressly not a party) called 'n + 1' which publishes the review under same name and collects their volumes and booklet including articles and more detailed treatments of various subjects in the series \\"Quaderni Internazionalisti\\".  Thesis of the party  = On Marxist theory = The International Communist Party holds that the doctrine of the party is founded on the principles of the historical materialism of the critical communism set out by Marx and Engels in the Communist Manifesto, Capital, and their other fundamental works and which formed the basis of the Communist International constituted in 1919 and of the Italian Communist Party founded at Leghorn in 1921 as a section of the Communist International and was a unitary and invariant body. The class party is accepted as the indispensable organ for the proletarian revolutionary struggle. It has always held that the party must historically get rid, once and for all, of the practice of alliances, even for transitory issues, with the middle class as well as with the pseudo-proletarian and reformist parties. = On tasks of the Communist Party = Holding that the Communist Party consists of the most advanced and resolute part of the proletariat, uniting the efforts of the working masses transforming their struggles for group interests and contingent issues into the general struggle for the revolutionary emancipation of the proletariat; the International Communist Party states that the duties of the party are propagating the revolutionary theory among the masses, organizing the material means of action, leading the working class all along its struggle, by securing the historical continuity and the international unity of the movement. According to the International Communist Party, the party is not made up of all members of the proletariat or even of its majority. It is the organization of the minority which has, collectively, reached and mastered revolutionary tactics in theory and in practice; in other words, which sees clearly the general objectives of the historic movement of the proletariat in the whole world and for the whole of the historical course which separates the period of its formation from that of its final victory. The party is not formed on the basis of individual consciousness; the International Communist Party emphasizes that it is not possible for each worker to become conscious and still less to master the class doctrine in a cultural way, neither is this possible for each militant nor even for the leaders of the Party as individuals. To them, this consciousness lay in the organic unity of the Party. The Party is the organic tissue whose function inside the working class is to carry out its revolutionary task in all its aspects and in its successive phases. Stressing the importance of the unity of the proletariat, the International Communist Party states that the party should never set up economic associations which exclude those workers who do not accept its principles and leadership. All forms of closed organizations that separate the working class are rejected. The ICP remains resolutely against the participation in the parliamentary elections, rejecting the idealist and utopian outlook which makes social transformation dependent on a circle of ‚Äùelected‚Äú apostles and heroes. = On opportunism = The International Communist Party defines opportunism as a wave of degeneration of proletarian parties. In opposition to opportunism, it rejects the subordination of the party's action to that of political committees of fronts, coalitions or alliances even if this subordination was to restrict itself to public declarations and be compensated by internal instructions to militants or the party and by the subjective intentions of the leaders. It holds that in the West all alliances or proposals of alliances with social democratic or petit- bourgeois parties should be refused at all costs; in other words that there should be no united political front. According to the International Communist Party, what made the parties unable to foresee and face the opportunist danger was a fundamental deviation in principles: the party states that it was neither internal democracy nor free elections which give the Party its nature of being the most conscious fraction of the proletariat and its function of revolutionary guide. It is instead the matter of a deep discrepancy of conceptions about the deterministic organicity of the party as a historical body, living in the reality of the class struggle. = On party action = The principal activity today is accepted to be the re-establishment of the theory of Marxist communism by the International Communist Party. The party will bring forward no new theory, but reaffirm the full validity of the fundamental theses of revolutionary Marxism, amply confirmed by facts and falsified and betrayed by opportunism to cover up retreats and defeats. The International Communist Party denounces and defends combating the Stalinists as revisionists and opportunists just as it has always condemned all forms of bourgeois influence on the proletariat. Oral and written propaganda are seen as an important party action. The cult of the individual is rejected as a very dangerous aspect of opportunism which should be fought, while the Party retains complete autonomy from all other political groups, parties, formations and fronts.

History Marrickville station opened on 1 February 1895 when the Bankstown line opened from Sydenham to Belmore.Marrickville Station NSWrail.netMarrickville Railway Station Group NSW Environment & Heritage When the station opened, it consisted only of the island platform. In 1916, the station's platforms were reconstructed with a new platform, now platform 2, built to the south of the island platform and the northern side of the island platform closed to make way for the Metropolitan Goods Line. The station has retained this set-up to date. The line through the station was electrified in 1926. The booking office on Platform 2 underwent alterations in 1944. New stairs down from Illawarra Road were built in 1985. In June 2016, an upgrade was completed with lifts and a new concourse built.Work to begin on Marrickville Station makeover Transport for NSW 27 May 2014Marrickville Station upgrade - Construction underway Transport for NSW During this work, the stairs to platform 1 were closed and replaced with a temporary footbridge from platform 2. Both platforms can be accessed from New Illawara Rd via the new concourse. Even though a concourse was built, the station remains ungated. Platforms & services Station prior to upgrade. Marrickville is a fairly major station on the Bankstown line. All trains make a stop at Marrickville, except for eastbound during the morning peak, when two trains per hour skip Marrickville. There will also occasionally be other services that don't stop, such as empty trains, or diverted services during trackwork. Transport links Transit Systems operate two routes via Marrickvile station: *423: Martin Place to Kingsgrove *L23: Martin Place to Kingsgrove Marrickville station is served by one NightRide route: *N40: East Hills station to City (Town Hall)  Description  The Marrickville station complex consists of two station buildings: the Platform 1 building (1895) and Platform 2 building (1911), with associated platforms built at the same time, along with a booking office on Platform 2 (1917). It also includes two sets of pedestrian steps: a northern set (1917) and a southern set (mid-1980s), along with an overbridge on Illawarra Road (1911). Marrickville railway station consists of one wayside platform to the south and an island platform to the north. Passenger rail only uses the south side of the island platform, with the Metropolitan Goods Line running on the north. The station buildings are original, as is the booking office at the western end of Platform 2. The station is accessed via stairs or lifts to both platforms from the concourse, or at a level entry onto Platform 2 from Station St. Illawarra Road is a major commercial shopping strip. ;Platform building - Platform 1 (1895) The Platform 1 building is a rectangular polychromatic face brick building with gabled roof and surrounding cantilevered awning clad in corrugated roof sheeting. The exterior was restored to original condition during upgrades in 2016. It contains a number of rooms, such as a ticket office, waiting rooms and toilets. The ticket office is no longer in use, as all paper tickets have been phased out on the Sydney Trains network in favour of smartcard ticketing (Opal card). All other rooms, except the toilets, are also locked off and not accessible to the public. ;Platform building - Platform 2 (1911) The Platform 2 building is a rectangular face brick building with gabled roof and integral shallower sloped single cantilevered awning. Internally, the building comprises a general waiting room; ladies room and ladies toilets, a store and men's toilets. As with the building on Platform 1, the exterior was restored during the 2016 upgrades. The whole building is closed to the public, mostly used as a storeroom. ;Booking office (1917) The original timber framed overhead booking office dating from 1895 was demolished and the existing timber framed booking office located on Platform 2 built in 1917‚Äì18. The building is a simple, rectangular weatherboard clad timber framed structure, with a gable roof clad in corrugated steel which extends as an awning with exposed rafters on the platform side. The building is currently used as a storeroom. ;Platforms Platform 1 has an asphalt surface with the original brick face and edge. The northern side of this platform (not used and fenced off) has a brick edge with the original brick face. Platform 2 also has its original brick face but with a concrete edge. Both platforms are approximately 160 metres long, enough to fit an 8 carriage suburban train. Both platforms are slightly curved and are equipped with LCD screens displaying next trains, together with automated announcements. Due to the lack of shelter at the eastern end of both platforms, there are no screens at this end. There are two small waiting shelters around the middle of platform 1, to encourage waiting passengers to spread out when it is raining, as all the station buildings are at the western end of the platform. ;Overbridge (1911) Steel girders and a concrete slab supported on central brick piers and side brick abutments. The original access stairs from the overbridge to Platform 1 had the original steel stringers but had new concrete treads and a new steel balustrade. The later stairs on the south were constructed from steel stringers supported on steel columns and with precast concrete treads. Both of these stairs were removed and replaced by the concourse during the 2016 upgrades.  Heritage listing  The railway station at Marrickville is significant as it is a station on the Sydenham to Bankstown Line which was constructed to relieve congestion on the Main South Line as well as to encourage suburban development and the growth of agriculture in the late 19th and early 20th century. The highly intact main platform building represents the period of transition from the boom time of the 1880s to the standardisation of NSW railway building design from the 1890s onwards, while the booking office on Platform 2 reflects a later period of expansion in the first quarter of the 20th century. Marrickville Railway Station is significant at a State level as the platform building demonstrates the high level of aesthetic design of the pre-1900 standard buildings, which included the use of polychromatic brickwork, decorative dentil coursing, ornate awning brackets and carved bargeboards. The platform building is intact and is representative of a small group of such ornate platform buildings including Canterbury and Belmore on the Bankstown Line. The platform building on Platform 2 provides an interesting contrast, demonstrating the simpler design of the standard platform buildings of the 1910/20s. Also of significance is the intactness of the weatherboard booking office which is unusual for being one of the few examples of a booking office located on a platform with street entry only and no access from the footbridge or overbridge, though the structure itself is representative of a standard design. Marrickville railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. * The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales * The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales * The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons * The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales * The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales * The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales Trackplan Track layout References = Attribution = External links *Marrickville station details Transport for New South Wales *Marrickville Metro station Sydney Metro Category:Easy Access railway stations in Sydney Category:Railway stations in Sydney Category:Railway stations in Australia opened in 1895 Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:Marrickville, New South Wales Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:Bankstown railway line ","title":"Marrickville railway station"},{"id":"2513427","text":"Dhoom 2 is a 2006 Indian Hindi-language action thriller film directed by Sanjay Gadhvi and produced by Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra at an estimated budget of under the Yash Raj Films.

It received an 83% approval rating among critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Critics praised Dhoom 2 for its exotic locales and elaborate action sequences. However, there was an appeal by the Mumbai city police commissioner to censor the fast-paced rash driving scenes due to fears that it would inspire Indian youths to ride their motorcycles rashly, resulting in an increase in the number of road accidents. A sequel titled Dhoom 3 was released on 20 December 2013, which also went on to become the twelfth-highest-grossing Bollywood film to date, and the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time as well at the time of its release. Plot Dhoom 2 The film opens in the Namib Desert. Mr. A (Hrithik Roshan) skydives onto a train that is carrying the Queen. He steals her crown by disguising himself as the Queen, beats her guards easily, and escapes. ACP Jai Dixit (Abhishek Bachchan) and the newly-promoted Sub- Inspector Ali Akbar Khan (Uday Chopra) are introduced to Shonali Bose (Bipasha Basu), a special officer assigned to investigate Mr. A's case, who also happens to be a former classmate of Jai. After the initial investigation, Dixit analyses the underlying trend in Mr. A's heists. He concludes that the theft will follow in one of 2 famous Mumbai city museums. When Dixit realizes that the artifact in the museum he is guarding happens to be imperfect, he rushes to the other museum, where a disguised Mr. A steals a rare diamond and escapes. While he is about to catch a flight, Mr. A sees on the TV that someone else claiming to be himself, challenges the police, saying that he will steal an ancient warrior sword. In response, Dixit, Bose, and Khan enforce a strict guard at the location of the sword. At night, Mr. A meets the real thief, the one who made the claim on TV, in the room that holds the sword. The police are alerted, but they manage to steal the sword, Shonali is injured in the confrontation and they manage to escape. The impersonator turns out to be Sunehri (Aishwarya Rai), a woman who idolises Mr. A; Sunehri convinces Mr. A to form an alliance but he turns her down. Later, after a game of basketball between the two, he finally agrees to work together. In Rio de Janeiro, Mr. A and Sunehri plan their next heist. As Dixit's analysis has named Rio the location of Mr. A's next heist, Jai and Ali travel to the city. There they meet Monali (Bipasha Basu), Shonali's twin sister, who only speaks English, and Ali immediately falls for her. Later Sunehri meets with Jai to discuss how things are going between her and Mr. A, revealing that they are working together, and Jai is using her by ensuring her freedom from prison. To get close to Mr. A and find out what his next plan is, they can catch and arrest him, but Sunehri begins to have her doubts. Meanwhile, the relationship between Mr. A and Sunehri evolves into romance and he unveils his real identity, Aryan, to her. However, during the Rio Carnival, disguised as one of the entertainers, he sees Sunehri and Jai together and realizes that Sunehri has been working undercover for Jai. The next day, Aryan forces Sunehri to play a game of Russian roulette. Sunehri cries and refuses to shoot him, but Aryan forces her to play. After six attempted shots, neither is killed, because Aryan never loaded the gun. Sunehri admits she betrayed Aryan and confesses her love for him. In their final heist, Aryan and Sunehri successfully steal some early Lydian coins while disguised as performing dwarfs. With the heist successfully pulled off, Jai realises that he has been betrayed and she called him on phone to confirm that she wants to stay with Aryan and does not wish to remain allied with Jai, forcing Jai and Ali to go after them. After the chase, all of them end up on the top of a waterfall, where Ali catches Sunehri. Sunehri, despite conveying her feelings for Aryan, shoots him. Aryan falls from the waterfall, after which Jai allows Sunehri to go free. Six months later, it is revealed that Aryan survived and has opened a restaurant in the Fiji islands with Sunehri. Jai meets Aryan and Sunehri at the restaurant and states that despite their crimes, he does not wish to imprison the couple. Aryan tells him where all the stolen artifacts can be found via a digital watch. Jai is aware of the couple's feelings towards each other but warns them against returning to their life of crime.

The film became a commercial box office hit and received positive reviews from audiences, but mixed-to-negative reviews from critics. As a result, producer Yash Chopra announced plans for a sequel, titled Dhoom 2: Back in Action. John Abraham, portrayer of Kabir Sharma, the villain of the predecessor, was eliminated from the sequel because Chopra did not want Dhoom 2 to repeat the stories featured in its predecessor. Instead, Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai were introduced into the franchise as the sequel's main villains. Aishwarya Rai's character was summarised as Catwoman, a female fictional comic book femme fatale or anti-hero . Rai stated, \\"All I can tell you is it would be nothing like anything you've seen me do before.\\" Producer Aditya Chopra told Rai to lose weight after she gained it for her role in 2004's Bride & Prejudice. Yash Chopra stated, \\"But yes, the role does require Aishwarya to convey oodles of sensuality. She has asked for a couple of months to get into shape. We (at Yash Raj Films) are very clear about every character in every script and what's required of the actors. Before Dhoom, Esha Deol was specifically briefed about the look and the attitude she needed to cultivate. She readily agreed, and look at what Dhoom did to her career!\\" Roshan also lost 5 kgs for his role at Aditya Chopra's request. With the exception of Abraham and Esha Deol, all of the other main actors in Dhoom were hired again for Dhoom 2. =Filming= Dhoom 2 was filmed in Mumbai (India), Namibia, Durban (South Africa), and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), making it the first Bollywood movie to be shot in Brazil. In total, production lasted 18 months and cost of . To ensure the sequel would be different from the original, which became famous for its brash motorcycle stunts, director Sanjay Gadhvi included very few motorcycles in Dhoom 2. Nonetheless, Roshan's role required him to perform several dangerous stunts involving activities such as roller-blading, sand boarding and snow-boarding. Dhoom 2 made extensive use of visual effects, which were filmed at Yash Raj Studios. While shooting at Yash Raj Studios, the film suffered from a flood that destroyed the studio sets and delayed production. Fight and action sequences were storyboarded before being shown to Gadhvi and Allan Amin, who would make changes. The scenes were then sketched, given \\"proper shot-list[s]\\", and shared with Tata Elxsi, who oversaw the pre- visualization of the sequences. Several scenes were filmed with the use of green screen and computer-generated imagery. For example, the stunts Roshan's performed on a train in the Namib Desert used green screen; after Roshan recorded the stunts on a set, Gadhvi traveled to the desert to film the background. Other stunts were performed by stuntmen whose faces were later digitally exchanged with the actors'. The bullet effects and Hrithik's gadgets and the mechanical arm were also computer-generated. The scene involving Abhishek Bachchan coming out of a lake using a jet ski was created using a green screen. The stunt came out at 90 degrees, but Sanjay Gadhvi wanted a 60 degrees jump. So, it was shot with a Super 35, and hence the angle could be changed. Gandhvi discussed the use of technology in an interview: Soundtrack The soundtrack of Dhoom 2 was recorded at YRF Studios. The music was composed by Pritam with background score by Salim-Sulaiman. The lyrics were penned by Sameer except \\"Dhoom Again\\" by Asif Ali Beg and \\"Crazy Kiya Re ‚Äî Remix\\" was remixed by Bunty Rajput. Although most of the song's lyrics are primarily written in Hindi with some English, \\"Dhoom Again\\" is almost entirely in English. The soundtrack received mixed reviews from critics but high praise from the audience. It became the best selling Bollywood soundtrack of the year. Release Dhoom 2's teaser trailer was released with Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna which released on 11 August 2006. Dhoom 2 was released on 24 November 2006 in India, where it received the widest release in Indian cinema history at the time with over 1800 prints, including 250 digital copies. Some locations raised ticket prices for the film. It was promoted with several tie-ins. Coca-Cola promoted the film as \\"Coke Uthale, Dhoom Machale\\". India's video game producing company FXLabs developed a game based on the film. Pepe Jeans sold Dhoom 2-related garments, including shirts, jeans, bandannas, caps, and metal accessories. Chetan Shah, the country head of Pepe Jeans London, stated: \\"Pepe Jeans is tremendously excited to be associated with the most awaited movie of the year Dhoom:2. The incredible starcast of Hrithik Roshan, Aishwarya Rai, Abhishek Bachchan, Bipasha Basu and Uday Chopra and the exciting and explosive content of the movie encapsulates everything that the Pepe Jeans brand stands for- young, cool, trendy, hip, fashionable and innovative. While promoting Dhoom 2, Hrithik Roshan admitted feeling foolish over his past statements about his co-star Aishwarya Rai being a \\"pretty face with no talent\\" after they worked together for the first time in Dhoom 2, where they became one of the most successful onscreen pairs in Bollywood that also met in other films such as Jodhaa Akbar and Guzaarish. =Legal issues= The city of Mumbai's police commissioner called for censoring of the fast-paced rash driving scenes in the film due to fears that it would inspire Indian youths to ride their motorcycles rashly, resulting in an increase in the number of road accidents. Unlike the original, the robberies depicted in Dhoom 2 were not inspired by any real-life crimes. Dhoom 2, allegedly inspired the robbery of a man by his nephew, who wore clothing similar to Hrithik's in the film while committing the crime. Box office In India, Dhoom 2 broke several box-office records, mainly those for opening day and opening weekend grosses, including a first week of in Mumbai and for all of India. In Mumbai, distributors received a profit of on the first week's business. Box Office India awarded it a \\"blockbuster\\" rating after the film netted in India and grossed worldwide on a budget of . It is currently the 13th highest-grossing film in India (unadjusted for inflation). Dhoom 2 grossed US$979,000 in North America in 63 theatres over its three-day opening weekend ($1.3 million over four days), becoming the third largest opening weekend for a Bollywood film in North America. Overall, it was the seventeenth ranked film at the American box office. Box Office Mojo reports it earned a total of $2,643,586 inside the United States and a total of $29,752,841 in other countries, including India. In Dubai, it achieved the highest first day opening for a Bollywood film. Dhoom 2 ranked sixth among opening weekends for international films at the United Kingdom box office with a gross (average per screen) of ¬£8,151. At the Australian box office, it had the twelfth highest opening and collected approximately A$176,462. It grossed approximately NZ $51,453 on five screens in New Zealand. Dhoom 2 is estimated to have grossed US$8,750,000 total in the overseas markets. Reception =India= In India, the film received positive reviews from critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 4.5 out of 5 stars, reporting \\"On the whole, Dhoom 2 is a winner all the way. For Yash Raj, who've not only produced but also distributed the film, Dhoom 2 should emerge as one of the biggest hits of their career.\\" Rajesh Karkera of Rediff gave it 3.5 stars out of 5, calling it \\"A complete roller-coaster ride which left me completely enthralled and exhausted. Sure, there are faults when you stop to think rationally. But that does not stop you from being dazzled by the film.\\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it a 3 star rating, saying that Dhoom 2 is without doubt better than its predecessor, and that Hrithik Roshan is the heart and soul of the film. Vijay Venkataramanan of Planet Bollywood gave it 7 out of 10 stars; while complaining about flaws in the plot and Aishwarya Rai‚Äôs performance, he still called it a good adrenaline-pumping entertainer. =International= Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported 83% of 6 critics were positive and gave it a \\"fresh\\" certificate. Variety commented, \\"Loaded with enough attitude, Bollywood starpower and buff bodies to stop a speeding train, Dhoom 2 has been doing humongous biz since its November 24 worldwide opening, and provides adequate proof that Yash Raj Films is good for more than just family-oriented comedy-dramas.\\" Rachel Saltz of The New York Times reviewed, \\"The pleasure principle is palpable in the giddy, slick Dhoom 2, a satisfying example of the new, thoroughly modern Bollywood. It may represent the new-fangled Bollywood, but old-fashioned star power is what animates and elevates it above its occasional narrative flaws and longueurs.\\" Film Journal Internationals Ethan Alter said, \\"Dhoom 2 has all of the benefits of a big-budget Bollywood production: big-name stars, exotic locales, well-produced musical numbers and elaborate (by Bollywood standards, anyway) action sequences. It makes no lasting contributions to world cinema, but if two-and-a-half hours of disposable entertainment are all you're after, you could do far worse.\\" L.A. Weeklys David Chute stated the film was, \\"A movie meal as satisfying as this one can make you feel that nothing else matters.\\" Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC gave it a two-star rating, writing \\"By roping in acclaimed action director Alan Amin to take care of the thrills and spills, you'd expect Gadhvi to have spent time crafting out a sophisticated storyline instead of simply sending his cast on a cat-and-mouse chase around the globe. It's only Roshan's charismatic performance as the criminal mastermind, and the sizzling chemistry he shares with Rai's sassy cohort, that rescues this adventure from becoming an elongated tourism commercial.\\" Manish Gajjar, Bollywood Correspondent for BBC Shropshire said, \\"With its high-powered action sequences matching Hollywood standards, Dhoom 2 is a winner all the way at the box office!\\" Accolades Dhoom 2 was nominated for several awards that year, but only picked up a few of the major ones. At the Filmfare Awards, Hrithik Roshan won Best Actor, out of 5 total nominations for the film. At the International Indian Film Academy Awards (IIFA), the film won for Best Makeup and Best Costume Design. At the Stardust Awards, Aishwarya Rai won Star of the Year ‚Äì Female and director Sanjay Gadhvi won the Hottest Young Filmmaker title.

Early life George William Foote was born in Plymouth, the son of William Thomas Foot (a customs officer) and Ann Winzar. Career In his Reminiscences of Charles Bradlaugh he recalls coming to London in January 1868 with \\"plenty of health and very little religion\\". He was taken to Cleveland Hall by a friend, and \\"heard Mrs. [Harriet] Law knock the Bible about delightfully. She was not what would be called a woman of culture, but she had what some devotees of 'culchaw' do not posses--a great deal of natural ability...\\" A few weeks later Foote heard Charles Bradlaugh speaking at the hall. He became involved with the secularism, freethought and republicanism, joining the Young Men's Secular Association, the National Secular Society, and contributing to Bradlaugh's National Reformer. In 1877 Foote joined the anti-Bradlaughites in the breakaway British Secular Union. The split was caused by several factors: Bradlaugh's alleged autocratic style; Bradlaugh's association with Annie Besant; and Bradlaugh and Besant's involvement in promoting birth control and Neo-Malthusianism. The BSU was relatively short-lived, and Foote himself was reconciled to Bradlaugh within a few years, becoming an NSS vice-president from 1882. The Secularist: A Liberal Weekly Review (1876-1877), Foote's first attempt to launch his own publication, in collaboration with George Jacob Holyoake, did not last long. In May, 1881, Foote started a serial publication called The Freethinker, which is still published. As a result of contents of this journal, Foote was charged with blasphemy, and eventually imprisoned for one year with hard labour. On receiving his sentence from Mr Justice North (a devout Catholic), Foote said \\"with great deliberation\\" to the Judge \\"My Lord, I thank you; it is worthy of your creed\\".\\"Central Criminal Court, March 5\\", The Times, 6 March 1883, p 12 His description of this experience was published in 1886 as Prisoner for Blasphemy. Once released, Foote continued to be active promoting his ideals, writing books and pamphlets, lecturing, and debating. Foote was well-versed in literature, and had extensive knowledge of ancient and contemporary writers, and ecclesiastical history. In 1890 Foote succeeded Bradlaugh as President of the National Secular Society and remained in that role for twenty-five years. His death was related by Chapman Cohen in The Freethinker (31 October 1915): > When I saw him on the Friday (two days) before his death he said, \\"I have > had another setback, but I am a curious fellow and may get all right again.\\" > But he looked the fact of death in the face with the same courage and > determination that he faced Judge North many years ago. A few hours before > he died he said calmly to those around him, \\"I am dying.\\" And when the end > came his head dropped back on the pillow, and with a quiet sigh, as of one > falling to sleep, he passed away.

Completed in 1968, it is in the Streeterville neighborhood on the Near North Side. Located adjacent to Navy Pier, the building is the only skyscraper that sits east of Lake Shore Drive in the city. Its tall curved three wing 'Y' shape was an inspiration for the Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai, United Arab Emirates by Chicago-born architect Adrian Smith. Development The architects for Lake Point Tower were John Heinrich and George Schipporeit, working under the firm name of Schipporeit and Heinrich; the two were students of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, one of the best known architects of the Bauhaus movement and International Style school, who taught at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. Lake Point Tower was completed in 1968, is approximately tall, and was the tallest apartment building in the world at that time. The project developer was William F. Hartnett, Jr., chairman and founder of Hartnett-Shaw Development Company, which was responsible for more than 260 residential and commercial real estate developments in the United States from 1961‚Äì1983.  Architecture  Lake Point Tower was inspired by Mies van der Rohe‚Äôs 1922 design for a glass- curtained skyscraper in Berlin. Schipporeit and Heinrich took van der Rohe's unbuilt office building concept and converted it to a residential building. Despite differences -- Lake Point Tower is much taller than van der Rohe‚Äôs original project, more regular in form, and its exterior glass curtain wall is tinted -- many consider it a Mies van der Rohe building executed by two of his prot√©g√©s. Because of its height and lakeside site, the skyscraper had to be designed to withstand high winds. At the center of the building is a triangular core, 59 feet wide, that contains nine elevators and three stairwells. This core holds all of the vertical weight of the building, allowing the perimeter columns on the facade to be much smaller. Radiating from the core are three arms that form an asymmetrical Y-shaped floor plan. The original four-armed design was changed to a three-armed design (120¬∞ apart). The outer walls are curved to prevent residents from seeing into other condominiums. The fa√ßade of the building is a curtain of bronze-tinted glass framed by gold-anodized aluminum, which reflects the sunlight off of Lake Michigan and looks golden. Other features Looking up at the tower in July 2018 Well known for its graceful curves and enviable location, Lake Point Tower is the only major private structure on the east side of Lake Shore Drive and likely to remain that way for the foreseeable future, given the city's rare occasions of building large structures on the east side of Lake Shore Drive. At the top of the building, on its 70th floor, is the upscale restaurant Cit√©. Lake Point Tower was one of the first high-rise residential buildings in the world to feature all-electric appliances and utilities and pioneered the concept of the \\"Park in the City,\\" being the first residential complex in a major city to have its own two-and-one-half acre park‚Äîincluding a playground, pool, duck pond, and waterfalls ‚Äî three stories above ground. The building also features an assortment of shops and restaurants on the second and ground levels of the complex, under the third-floor park. Lake Point Tower's position between Lake Shore Drive and Navy Pier gives it unimpeded views in all directions that are protected, for the foreseeable future, by ordinances controlling the use of construction exactly on the city's waterfront. On some sites such as Reddit, some have stated the tower appears to look like a fidget spinner from the top. In actuality, the tower debuted in 1968, decades before fidget spinners debuted in 1993, so a better statement may be that fidget spinners look like the tower. Lake Point Tower likely inspired the fictional Merlaut Hotel featured in the video game Watch Dogs. Movies shot on location Lake Point Tower has been host to many film shoots including: * Raw Deal (1986) * Folks!, (1991) * Straight Talk, (1992) This film featured Dolly Parton and James Woods, and had Parton's character living in Lake Point Tower. * While You Were Sleeping, (1995) Parts of this film, starring Sandra Bullock and Peter Gallagher, were shot in Lake Point Tower. * Meet the Parents, (2000) * Category 6: Day of Destruction, (2004) In an outtake of this film, it is destroyed by a tornado in news footage. * The Lake House, (2006) Hospital reception area filmed in Lake Point Tower's lobby. * Divergent (2014) Briefly shown abandoned and decayed in a future Chicago.

Biography Hu was of Hakka ancestry from Ji'an, Jiangxi. His father had moved to Panyu, Guangdong to take up an official post. He was qualified as juren at 21 years of age. He studied in Japan starting in 1902, and joined the Tongmenghui (Chinese Revolutionary Alliance) in 1905 as an editor of the newspaper Min Bao. From 1907 to 1910, he participated in several armed revolutions. Shortly after the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, he was appointed the governor of Guangdong and chief secretary of the Provisional Government. He participated in the Second Revolution in 1913, and followed Sun Yat-sen to Japan after the failure of that revolution. There they established the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party). Hu lived in Guangdong between 1917 and 1921 and worked for Sun Yat-sen, as the minister of transportation first and principal consultant later. Hu was elected to be a central executive committee member in the first conference of the Kuomintang in January, 1924. In September, he acted as vice generalissimo, when Sun Yat-sen left Guangzhou to Shaoguan. Sun died in Beijing in March, 1925, and Hu was one of the three most powerful figures in the Kuomintang. The other two were Wang Jingwei and Liao Zhongkai. Liao was assassinated in August of the same year, and Hu was suspected and arrested. After the Ninghan split in 1927, Hu supported Chiang Kai-shek and was head of the Legislative Yuan in Nanjing. Later on February 28, 1931, Hu was placed under house arrest by Chiang because of disputes over the new provisional constitution. Internal party pressure forced Chiang to release him. After that, Hu became a powerful leader in South China, holding three political principles of resistance: resistance against Japanese invasion, resistance against warlords, and finally resistance against the self-proclaimed leader Chiang Kai-shek. The anti-Chiang factions in the KMT converged on Guangzhou to set up a rival government. They demanded Chiang's resignation from his dual posts of president and premier. Civil war was averted by the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Hu continued to rule southern China, the heartland of the KMT, with the help of Chen Jitang and the New Guangxi clique. There he attempted to create a model government free of corruption and cronyism to discredit Chiang's Nanjing regime. Hu was an advocate of action against Japanese aggression, criticizing Chiang Kai-shek for \\"his spineless failure to adopt a strong policy towards the foreign power which has torn and ravaged our homeland!\\" Hu visited Europe and stopped his political attack on Chiang Kai-shek in June, 1935. In the first session of the fifth conference of Kuomintang in December 1935, he was absently elected as the Chair of Central Committee of Common Affairs. Hu returned to China in January, 1936, and lived in Guangzhou until he died of cerebral hemorrhage on May 12, 1936. His death sparked a crisis. Chiang wanted to replace Hu with loyal followers in southern China and end the autonomy the south enjoyed under Hu. As a result, Chen and the New Guangxi clique conspired to remove Chiang from office. In the so-called \\"Liangguang Incident\\", Chen was forced to resign as governor of Guangdong after Chiang bribed many of Chen's officers to defect and the conspiracy collapsed. Hu's political philosophy was that one's individual rights are a function of one's membership in a nation.

Her debut, Smashed: Story of a Drunken Girlhood, was released in 2005 by Viking Penguin and became a New York Times bestseller. Zailckas attended Nashoba Regional High School in Bolton, Massachusetts and Syracuse University. She is a 2014 recipient of the Alex Awards. Personal life Zailckas grew up in a middle-class family in the northeast. On September 1, 2008 Zailckas married Eamon Hamilton, singer and songwriter of the band Brakes, whom she met on the social networking site Myspace, in Romainville, France. Memoir-writing As a writer, Zailckas says her writing is informed by memoirists Mary Karr, Nick Flynn, Tobias Wolff, as well as novelists T.C. Boyle, Jeffrey Eugenides, A.M. Homes, Richard Ford, Haruki Murakami. She has also admitted she is heavily influenced by music and song lyrics. Zailckas has been quoted as saying, \\"If you're a writer, there's a lot of inspiration to be found in lyrics. That's the first thing I do before I get to work in the morning: have a cup of coffee and put on a record.\\" Zailckas downplays the catharsis of memoir-writing, saying, \\"All said and done, I'm reluctant to say writing Smashed was cathartic. For one, I think we assign that term to women far more often than we assign it to men. All too often, men's works are deemed 'literature' and women's are dismissed as 'therapy.' On a personal level, sure, it's easier to discuss old indignities. Talking, for instance, about a horrifying blackout doesn't rattle me the way it used to. I'm not convinced I've come to term with old aches as much as I've had to numb myself to them for the sake of spreading the book's message. Ultimately, I think a memoir leaves its author with more terror than comfort, more questions than closure. More than anything, I feel a growing breach between 'me' and the 'me' on the page. It's an occupational hazard, I guess. I feel sort of exiled from my own experiences.\\" She also says she finds writing fiction more challenging than writing narrative non-fiction. \\"For me, fiction-writing is about escapism. Whereas memoir-writing is about facing cold, harsh realities. I'll let you guess which one is more of a party... Naw, in reality, there are challenges to both. In memoir, there's the burden of truth. And in fiction, there's the burden of fantasy. Me, I find fiction harder. There are so many possibilities in fiction. The story can go absolutely anywhere. And that overwhelms me. That strikes fear in my timid, little heart. I like being restricted to the cage of fact, the coop of reality. Without it, I feel a certain agoraphobia.\\" =Smashed= Smashed chronicles Zailckas' decade-long struggle with alcohol abuse, beginning at fourteen, in an effort to explain the binge drinking phenomenon that plagues America's youth. Around the time she quit drinking, Zailckas became preoccupied with an old memory, which involved a night that she had her stomach pumped when she was 16. According to Zailckas, she had not thought about that night in a number of years, but she suddenly could not get it out of her head. Eventually, she sat down and wrote about it. The piece later became a chapter in her book. Around the same time, Zailckas was hearing a lot in the news about \\"girls of her generation\\" and how they were drinking younger and more than all the generations of women who'd gone before them. The Harvard School of Public Health reported, between 1993 and 2001, there was a threefold increase in the number of women who reported being drunk on ten or more occasions in the previous month. Time magazine ran a cover story about female binge drinkers. Zailckas did not agree with what the psychologists and the sociologists, the clinicians and the statisticians had to say, which was: \\"girls today are drinking more because they‚Äôre just so damn liberated, because they‚Äôre bursting with confidence and girl power, because they believe they can match boys everywhere, including the bar.\\" In her own experience, the author says, she and her female friends drank largely because it was an expression of their unhappiness and lack of confidence. It occurred to Zailckas, then 23, that she could offer a younger perspective. Alcoholism Zailckas has been challenged by some readers who want to dispute her assertion that she is \\"not an alcoholic.\\" In interviews, Zailckas maintains: \\"I‚Äôve talked to a lot of addiction counselors who say alcoholism is made up of two things: abuse and addiction. God knows I had that abuse down pat. But I don‚Äôt know that I necessarily felt (or feel) that addiction. And so no, I don‚Äôt identify myself as an alcoholic. That identity didn‚Äôt feel true to me, so I didn‚Äôt write it. I also think the brand 'alcoholic' prevents a lot of people, especially young people, from seeking help or even reevaluating their relationship with alcohol. In my mind, the whole point of Smashed is to say, you don‚Äôt have to be a quote-unquote alcoholic in order to examine the underlying reasons why you're drinking.\\" =Fury= In February 2010, Zailckas announced a sequel to Smashed on her Facebook page. Her follow-up, Fury: a Memoir was published on September 7, 2010. It was published by Viking Penguin, who described it as relating her exploration with her feelings of anger, the effects of that anger and the psychological aspects of repression and the turmoil of her own life which caused it. The book combines psychological research with her personal story. Bibliography *Smashed: Story of a Drunken Girlhood.

It is the oldest surviving single-arch railway bridge in the world, and a key element of the industrial heritage of England. It was built in 1725‚Äì26 by stonemason Ralph Wood, funded by a conglomeration of coal-owners known as the \\"Grand Allies\\" (founded by Colonel Liddell and the Hon. Charles Montague and George Bowes the owner of Gibside Estate on which the bridge is situated) at a cost of ¬£12,000. Two tracks crossed the Arch: one (the \\"main way\\") to take coal to the River Tyne, and the other (the \\"bye way\\") for returning the empty wagons. Over 900 horse-drawn wagons crossed the arch each day using the Tanfield Railway. When the bridge was completed in 1726, it was the longest single-span bridge in the country with an arch span of , a record it held for thirty years until 1756 when the Old Bridge was built in Pontypridd, Wales. After he designed the bridge, Ralph Wood was so afraid that his arch would collapse that he committed suicide, but the bridge still stands today. An inscription on a sundial at the site reads \\"Ra. Wood, mason, 1727\\". Use of the Arch declined when Tanfield Colliery was destroyed by fire in 1739. The Arch has been Grade I listed since 1950. It was restored and reinforced in the 1980s. There are a series of scenic public paths around the area and the Causey Burn which runs underneath it. The quarry near the bridge is a popular spot for local rock climbers. Causey Burn itself flows into Beamish Burn which then flows into the River Team eventually discharging into the River Tyne. References * Skempton, A.W.

Lake Shore Drive along Lake Michigan in the Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. Construction began in 1949 and the project was completed in 1951. The towers were added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 28, 1980, and were designated as Chicago Landmarks on June 10, 1996. The 26-floor, 254-ft (82 m) tall towers were designed by the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and dubbed the \\"Glass House\\" apartments. Construction was by the Chicago real estate developer Herbert Greenwald, and the Sumner S. Sollitt Company. The design principles, first expressed in the 1921 Friedrichstrasse Skyscraper competition in Berlin and built thirty years later in 860‚Äì880 Lake Shore Drive, were copied extensively and are now considered characteristic of the modern International Style as well as essential for the development of modern High-tech architecture. The towers were not entirely admired at the time they were built, yet they went on to be the prototype for steel and glass skyscrapers worldwide. Initially, it was difficult to acquire financing for the project, turned down by lenders like Baird & Warner, who considered the design scheme to be too extreme.Handley, John. \\"Looking Forward-Is Chicago shifting into a modern mode?\\" Chicago Tribune 2 June 2002: Real Estate 1. 860‚Äì880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments embody a Modernistic tone with their verticality, grids of steel and glass curtain walls (a hallmark of Mies' skyscrapers), and complete lack of ornamentation. Tenants had to accept the neutral gray curtains that were uniform throughout the buildings;no other curtains or blinds were permitted lest they mar the external appearance. Since Mies was a master of minimalist composition, his principle was \\"less is more\\" as it is demonstrated in his self-proclaimed \\"skin and bones\\" architecture.\\"Mies and the Mastodon.\\" New Republic 6 August 2001: 25‚Äì30. The structural engineer for the project was Georgia Louise Harris Brown, who was the first African American to receive an architecture degree from the University of Kansas, and second African Americans woman to receive an architecture license in the United States. Controversy 860-880 Lake Shore Drive (left) has windows attached to structure, not to mullions; Esplanade Apartments at 900-910 Lake Shore Drive (right) were first true curtain-wall high-rises. This building, like many of his Chicago high-rise structures, causes controversy in the pure minimalist community due to its mullions. Mies is hailed as the father of \\"less is more\\"; however, 860‚Äì880 Lake Shore Drive is covered in non-functional I-beam mullions. Mies explains how the mullions do not violate his less is more philosophy in a 1960 interview: \\"To me structure is something like logic. It is the best way to do things and express them\\".Puente, Moises. \\"Conversations With Mies\\" p31. New York, Princeton Architectural Press, 2008. The mullions on his buildings reflect the inner structure and therefore give truth to the aesthetic of the building. The idea of truth in architecture aligns with the aesthetic and principles of the international style as taught at the Bauhaus. Although the 860-880 buildings were the first high-rises to look like they were sheathed with a curtain wall, they in fact were not, because the windows were attached to the structure, not to the decorative-only mullions. It was Mies van der Rohe's 900-910 North Lake Shore (aka Esplanade Apartments) just to the north that were the first high- rises to actually have an uninterrupted glass/aluminum curtain wall, although not the first with a curtain wall. Renovations Krueck and Sexton Architects of Chicago were commissioned to renovate the historical towers. Teaming up with them were the preservation architects, Harboe Architects along with forensic and structural analysis firm, Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc. This team was directed to fix prior renovations done to the buildings. The preceding renovations took away from the historical accuracy of the towers. Architects were assigned to restore the distorted lighting scheme with original translucent glass, replace the deteriorating travertine plaza, which connects the two towers, and exchange for stones with more historical precision.

History In September 1908 Devonport High School for Girls (DHSG) was recognised as a girls' secondary school. It was originally located at Paradise Road, Stoke in Plymouth, and known as Devonport Municipal Secondary School for Girls. It was established approximately 15 years after its sibling Devonport High School for Boys. The school moved to its current location which overlooks the Plymouth Argyle football ground, Home Park, on 10 September 1937. The school was divided into four houses- St.Joan, St.Margaret, St.Monica and St.Ursula. They were then changed to Falcon, Kestrel, Hawk and Eagle. Today the house system still exists but are now named Flete, Kitley, Hartland and Edgecumbe after local houses. During World War II the girls were evacuated to Tiverton Grammar School, whilst the DHSG building was initially used by the fire service who were drafted in from across England to fight fires created by the aerial bombardment. It was also used as a machine shop for the dockyard during this period. The building suffered bomb damage during the war. The tennis and netball courts added in 1952 can now be seen at a lower level than the playing field due to a crater left by an exploded mine. Honour boards which hang at the back of the main hall were paid for by the money each of the pupils received to mark the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. In 1971 DHSG started to accept girls from all areas of Plymouth and by the 1980s girls were coming from outside Plymouth. In 2005 DHSG acquired Specialist Language College status bringing with it funding to provide better facilities, not just in building updating and expansion but in technology also. The new Learning Centre constructed in 2005 housed a modern library, new language laboratories and two fully equipped computer rooms. Academics DHSG is a grammar school, catering for students at the top end of the academic ability range. These students are selected by means of the 11-plus entrance exam, which tests potential students' English comprehension and Mathematical skills. DHSG is a specialist language school and in 2011 acquired Academy Trust Status. As of 2013/14 it has some 826 students, of whom around 198 are sixth form students. The school has maintained its Specialist Language College status, and introduced Chinese into the curriculum in September 2006. On entering the school students choose to study either French or Spanish. In Year 8 all students can choose a second language to study which includes Chinese, French, German, Latin or Spanish. DHSG has achieved the full International School Award from the British Council in 2005,2009,2012 and 2015. In the summer of 2013 the school achieved 100% five GCSE grades A*-C including English and Mathematics and the highest EBacc measure in the local area. The school has qualified for an Educational Outcomes Award by being in the top 20 per cent of schools nationally for progress made by pupils between their key stage 2 results and their GCSE results. Sue Williamson, Chief Executive of SSAT, the national schools' membership organisation for improvement and collaboration, said: \\"Devonport High School for Girls should be congratulated for their exceptional achievement. They have proved themselves to be leading the field in improving GCSE outcomes for their students.\\" \\"These results are testament to the commitment and hard work of the students, teachers and leadership team, and show what can be achieved when skilled teachers have high expectations and ambition for every young person. \\" In August 2017 and 2018 DHSG was voted the Best State Funded Secondary School in the Greater Plymouth Area by the Real Schools Guide. The school has continued to maintain high academic standards having achieved the highest Progress 8 and Attainment 8 score in the Greater Plymouth Area in 2017 and 2018.

It can excavate 240,000 tons of coal or 240,000 cubic metres of overburden daily - the equivalent of a football field dug to deep. The coal produced in one day fills 2400 coal wagons. The excavator is up to 220 m (721 ft) long (slightly shorter than Baggers 287 and 293) and approximately 96 m (315 ft) high. The Bagger's operation requires 16.56 megawatts of externally supplied electricity.Die gr√∂ssten Bagger der Welt (The biggest excavators in the world) It can travel per minute (0.1 to 0.6 km/h). The chassis of the main section is wide and sits on 3 rows of 4 caterpillar track assemblies, each wide. The large surface area of the tracks means the ground pressure of the Bagger 288 is very small (1.71 bar or 24.8 psi); this allows the excavator to travel over gravel, earth and even grass without leaving a significant track. It has a minimum turning radius of approximately 50 metres, and can climb a maximum gradient of 1:18 (5¬∞ incline). The excavating head itself is in diameter and has 18 buckets each holding of overburden. By February 2001, the excavator had completely exposed the coal source at the Tagebau Hambach mine and was no longer needed there. In three weeks it made a trip to the Tagebau Garzweiler, traveling across Autobahn 61, the river Erft, a railroad line, and several roads. The move cost nearly 15 million German marks and required a team of seventy workers. Rivers were crossed by placing large steel pipes for the water to flow through and providing a smooth surface over the pipes with rocks and gravel. Special grass was seeded to smooth its passage over valuable terrain. Moving Bagger 288 in one piece was more economical than disassembling the excavator and moving it piece by piece. The Bagger 288 is one of a group of similar sized and built vehicles, such as Bagger 281 (built in 1958), Bagger 285 (1975), Bagger 287 (1976), Bagger 293 (1995), etc. 288 and related excavators at the Garzweiler stripmine  In popular culture  * In the film Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2012), the rider possesses a Bagger 288 turning it into a fiery vehicle of destruction against his enemies. * In the popular videogame Rust (2013), there is a large monument with the title \\"Giant Excavator Pit\\". The developers of the game told in a press release that the location was modeled after the Bagger 288.

There are no stoplights and very few commercial businesses. History As early as 1712, meadows in Speonk were leased to cattle-owners from Southampton. Most of the early settlers of Speonk came west from Southampton and Bridgehampton in the 1740s to clear the forests and build farms. During the 1880s, duck farms thrived in Speonk, but few survived past the turn of the century. The name Speonk was inspired by a Native American word meaning high place. An 1897 Long Island Rail Road catalog listed Speonk, noting that that name \\"certainly sounds like the call of a frog.\\" Some residents pressed to change the name to Remsenburg, to honor a prominent resident, Charles Remsen, who had donated a new Presbyterian Church. Today, both names remain in use, each covering different areas of the community. The area close to the bay is called Remsenburg, and the more bucolic inland area is still called Speonk. During the twentieth century, its most famous resident was the English writer P.G. Wodehouse. He wrote many of the escapades of Bertie Wooster and his manservant, Jeeves, from a home on Basket Neck Lane in Remsenburg. Other residents of note include the songwriter Frank Loesser, who wrote for Broadway shows including Guys and Dolls; the playwright Guy Bolton, who collaborated with Wodehouse on Anything Goes; Marvel Comics editor Stan Lee; Sandy Becker, a New York children's television host, and Dave Garroway, the original host of NBC's Today Show when it first aired in January 1952.

The zoo has become a part of the city's history. Although, the original pre-revolutionary buildings are no longer standing, the overall layout of the zoo is very similar to the original zoological gardens of the late 19th century. The new entrance to the zoo, built by the architect N. D Strukov after 1910 The first owners of Saint Petersburg zoo were Sofia and Julius Gebhardt. The zoo's first collection of animals included tigers, bears, lions, small predators, birds and parrots. The years 1872 to 1897 were some of the best years for the zoo. The owner during this time was the second husband of Sofia Gebhardt, E. A Rost. Under his management, the zoo's collection included around 1161 species. Funds to maintain the collection came from the commercial ventures of the zoo, namely the restaurant and theatre. Since 1879, ethnographic exhibitions were held at the zoo. Rost retired in 1898. The zoological gardens fell into decline and closed in 1909. Around this time, discussions were held about creating a zoo for scientific studies in the capital. The idea was also put forward to move the zoo to Udelny Park. In 1910, S. H. Novinkov became the new owner of the Zoo. Under his management, old enclosures were renovated and new were ones built, as well as a new pond. The animals that were acquired by him lived for a long time, even after the Russian Revolution in 1917. The children's favourite elephant, Betty, died during the Leningrad Blockade, whilst the female hippo, called Beauty, survived the Second World War. The zoo was nationalised in 1918. An academic board was formed to manage the zoo. The Scientific Library and Animal Programmes Department was also created. In 1929 the Young Zoologists Club was formed, which still exists today. Since 1932, the polar bears began to breed, which at that time was extremely rare, and this is why the zoo's emblem is a polar bear. For the zoo's 75th anniversary in 1940, it was gifted 422 acres of land in Udelny Park. Advertisement for the Zoological Gardens, 1930. However, before the construction could start, World War II started. The zoo suffered greatly during the war, but did not stop its work even during the most difficult times of the Leningrad Blockade. The workers were able to save part of the collection of animals, and the animals even had offspring. On site lectures were held and in the summer the zoo was open to visitors again. In memory of the heroic actions of the workers who saved the Zoo during the Leningrad Blockade, the zoo, disregarding the city's renaming to Saint Petersburg, remained named as Leningrad Zoo. The zoo was opened permanently in the spring of 1944, and since development in the new area was not possible, restoration work began on the old site. The most intensive construction was carried out in 1951. In 1952 the zoological gardens was renamed to zoological park. During the 1950s and 60s, many new and interesting animals were acquired. The number of different species in the collection, as well as the scientific and educational work being carried out at the Zoo, meant that it was one of the leading zoos in the Soviet Union. The zoo observed its 100-year anniversary in 1965. Commemorative coin for the zoo's 150 year anniversary. At this time, the zoo's collection was one of the largest in the Soviet Union, but the majority of buildings and facilities were in unsatisfactory condition. Therefore, the decision was made to carry out complete renovation work, which started in 1967. Since the renovation was planned to last 3 to 5 years, the plan was to construct new buildings on site of the old ones. The fact that the work took such a long time was one of the main reasons for the decline of such an excellent collection of animals, and the majority of difficulties in the further acquisition of animals. The zoo lost both its elephant and hippo enclosures. The hippopotamuses were moved to Kiev, the rhinoceros was moved to Belarus, and the African elephant to Tashkent. By 1988 only 8 buildings had been built as part of the renovations. In 1996, construction of a Terrarium begun, but this was stopped due to lack of funding. This building was only opened for visitors in 2007, renamed as ‚ÄòExotarium‚Äô, which houses fish, snakes, lizards, turtles, crocodiles and other animals. In 2005 the government developed a strategy to develop Leningrad Zoo at its historical site, where it is currently located. According to this document, the Zoo must comply with European standards. In 2015 the Bank of Russia released a commemorative coin to mark the zoo's 150-year anniversary. Animal Exhibits View of the entrance to the Exotarium Commemorative stamp for the zoo's 150 year anniversary Leningrad Zoo is an important cultural and educational centre in Saint Petersburg, as well as a traditional place for families and tourists to visit. Educational actives are often held, such as the Young Zoologists Club, as well as a variety of courses, lectures and guided tours. The zoo's current collection of animals is diverse and consists of around 600 types of animals, including large and small predators, hoofed animals, birds, camels, alpacas and llamas, primates, rodents, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates, and fish. Priority has been given to the smaller species which don't require a lot of space, as the zoo has limited area. * Predator's House is home to big cats such as jaguars, African lions, pumas and snow leopards. Inside the exhibit, there are open air winter cages for the lions and jaguars. There are also separate smaller enclosures for mongooses and meerkats. * Primate's House houses a variety of primates, and includes lemurs, armadillos, and a few other that live in warm environments. The animals are moved to an outside enclosure during the summer period. * Exotarium covers two floors. The aquarium is located on the first floor, and is home to different types of coral, marine and freshwater fish and other aquatic life. The second floor houses reptiles and amphibians and insects, as well as a winter enclosure for birds, and other small predators.

It is also home to meerkats and mongoose during the summer. * European Forest Exhibit houses typical animals of the European forest, such as squirrels, hares, lynx, and beavers. * Tropical House houses porcupines, peccaries, parrots, squirrel monkeys and other species that require a warm environment. In the summer, all the animals are moved to an outdoor enclosure. Birds are housed in the outer enclosures of the tropical house during the winter. * Deer Circle has reindeer, Pere David's deer and elk. * Kangaroo and Emu Enclosure is a complex of enclosures, which house Bennett's tree-kangaroos and emus. In the summer, you can see them in open air enclosures and in the winter, they are kept in a building with large, panoramic windows. * Educational Animals House is where the animals used in the zoo's lectures and educational programmes are housed, including lynx, steppe marmot, owls, foxes, amongst others. * Children's Zoo has domestic animals such as different breeds of chickens, geese, cows, rabbits, and turkeys. Children can feed Cameroonian goats animal feed that can be purchased at the entrance. * House of Birds houses owls (hawk owl, artic owl, long- tailed and great grey owl and the eagle owl) as well as magpies, crows, peregrine falcon, western capercaillie, kestrel and other animals. In the summertime it also houses parrots, toucans and other birds that require warm temperatures. * Birds of Prey Enclosure has a variety of different species, such as the white-tailed eagle, Stellar's sea eagle, black vulture, raven, tawny eagle, saker falcon, and Andean condor. * Bird Pond is a large, round pond, which houses greylag and bar-headed geese, Canadian and barnacle geese, and whooper swans. Pelicans are also housed here during the summer. * Camel Enclosure houses Bactrian camels, llamas and alpacas. * Ranger Path is a path with questions and riddles that children can answer along the way, giving information about the animals and plants in the Leningrad region. There are also small bird aviaries along this path. Separate enclosures and exhibits were built for polar bears, Siberian tigers, giraffes, wolves, Japanese Macaques, Japanese cranes, black swans (in summer, they are housed in the artificial pond), and otters. In addition, the zoo has enclosures which showcase a mixed collection of birds, as well as an enclosure for horses, ‚ÄòEagle Hill‚Äô, and a summer enclosure for monkeys. There is also a riding circle, where you can ride a horse or pony. The zoo is actively working on renovating the old buildings, as well as creating new exhibitions. Therefore, the list of exhibits and enclosures may change.

It was the last time J-class yachts would race for the America's Cup. Design Harold Stirling Vanderbilt funded construction of Ranger, and she was launched on May 11, 1937. She was designed by Starling Burgess and Olin Stephens, and constructed by Bath Iron Works.

Sawyer and published by Tor. It depicts the effects of the opening of a connection between two versions of Earth in different parallel universes: the world familiar to the reader, and another where Neanderthals became the dominant intelligent hominid. The societal, spiritual and technological differences between the two worlds form the focus of the story. The trilogy's volumes are Hominids (published 2002), Humans (2003), and Hybrids (2003). Hominids first appeared as a serial in Analog Science Fiction, won the 2003 Hugo Award for Best Novel, and was nominated for the John W. Campbell Award the same year; Humans was a 2004 Hugo Award finalist. In 2017, the full trilogy was presented the Aurora Award for Best of the Decade. The initial contact between the two worlds takes place at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Sudbury, Ontario, which is also the location of a scientific research facility in the Neanderthal world. Terminology As the books unfold, the term human is used to refer to both species; both species agree to use the Neanderthal terms‚Äîgliksin for members of Homo sapiens and barast for members of Homo neanderthalensis‚Äîto distinguish between them. Barast society Barasts (Neanderthals) are dedicated hunter-gatherers, and have no developed concept of agriculture. Despite this, they are still technologically advanced, possessing quantum computers, helicopters, communications, and biological recording instruments. They live in harmony with their environment, using clean energy, living homes, and keeping a constant population. They measure long periods of time in lunar months, not years. The total barast population is much lower, numbering only 185 million worldwide compared to the gliksins' (humans') 6 billion. =Family life= Due to their advanced senses of smell, barasts are very sensitive to pheromones. Accordingly, women and men live in separate communities for 25 out of every 29 days. The four days when they do come together ‚Äî known as two becoming one ‚Äî are the cause of a monthly celebration and holiday. All barast women have synchronized menstrual cycles, and the meeting-times are set so that conception is unlikely ‚Äî except every 10 years, when another generation is purposely conceived. Generations thus grow in synchronized, ten-year cycles; no barast needs to give his age, as simply stating his generation (if this is not simply inferred from his appearance) will give the needed information. All children live with their mothers until they reach the age of ten; boys then go to live with their fathers. Children remain with their appropriate parent until the approximate age of 18. Despite this separation of sexes, the barast find the idea of considering either sex better than the other for any reason to be completely foreign (female barast do not suffer any large-scale physical incapacity due to pregnancy). The separation is a voluntary and cultural thing, and people of both sexes are free to go where the other lives at all times, but find it physically and socially discomfiting to do so when two are not one. However, facilities and living styles are fully and truly 'separate but equal' in barast society, and in the rare event that it is too difficult or resource intensive to do so (for example, large scale scientific facilities), this separation is ignored without incident. While opposite-sex couples form long-term bonds similar to marriage, the same is true of life during the rest of the month. All barasts would consider themselves bisexual by the gliksin definition; they form same- sex bonds while two are not one. Thus each adult who so chooses, no matter their gender, has a man-mate and a woman-mate; one for procreation and the genetic family basis, the other for companionship and a family unit base when their opposite-sex partner is not present. The larger, intertwined family networks that result add cohesion to barast society. =Government and justice= The barast world has a single government hierarchy: each region of the globe is governed by a local Gray Council; these in turn answer to the High Gray Council, the world government. About eight decades before the time of the novels, companion implants were perfected and issued to all barasts. These are comprehensive recording and transmission devices, mounted in the forearm of each person. Their entire life is constantly monitored and sent to their alibi archive, a repository of recordings that are only accessible by their owner, or by the proper authorities when investigating an infraction, and in the latter case only in circumstances relevant to the investigation. Recordings are maintained after death; it is not made clear what the reasoning is for this and under what circumstances and or by whom a deceased person's archive can be accessed. Any serious crime has a single punishment: the castration of the offender and all others who share at least half his genes (parents, siblings, and children). This eugenic practice serves to keep any undesirable elements out of the gene pool without severely punishing an offender, beyond his loss of genetic heritage. As a result, serious crimes of almost any sort are virtually unknown in the barast world. The exception is sexual crimes committed by a partner. Because the punishment for such crimes, such as spousal abuse, would include the castration of the complainant's own children, these crimes are unreported. While divorce for barast is generally a simple matter of deciding and declaring not to be with another person, those in such relationships find themselves trapped, as freeing their partner to seek a new mate opens the possibility that the new mate will report the violent activity. Because barast physical strength is much higher than that of a gliksin, any physical violence between them is almost certain to result in death or serious injury. They thus lack any direct physical confrontation sports and martial arts (the second is lacking additionally because barast do not believe in conflict; they have had only one war in their recent history, with the loss of 83 people being considered a horrendous tragedy). Any physical violence, if reported, results in immediate imposition of castration. However, because the punishment is so severe, these incidents are not always reported officially, and if the injured party is willing to forgive, and the aggressor undertakes counseling for anger management, an incident may go unpunished. Such incident is admissible in a future legal hearing as evidence of a prior disposition to violence, however. =Environment= Lower population levels and the absence of large-scale agriculture mean that many species exist which are extinct on the gliksin version of Earth. These include not only birds such as the passenger pigeon, but also megafauna such as the woolly mammoth. Also, forests are much more extensive because there was no need to cut them down on a large scale. Barasts have domesticated wolves as companions, but have not bred them into the many varieties of the domestic dog. A gliksin may become fearful upon seeing a barast dog, thinking it a wild wolf. A barast, seeing a gliksin's dog such as a dachshund, may wonder if the creature really is a dog. It is heavily implied that the barast did not spread to large areas of their world until after they had achieved a high level of civilization. One scene has a gliksin and a barast ancestor looking across the Mediterranean; the gliksin ancestor eagerly sets off to explore the new, strange place, while the barast ancestor notes its existence and goes home. This is consistent with their hunter-gatherer lifestyle which favors high levels of knowledge concerning the land and low migration, including a general avoidance of danger. Also, it is mentioned that barast are naturally of higher intelligence than gliksin, with average IQ being 10% higher before a several generation eugenic campaign, during which the least intelligent 10% were voluntarily sterilized to increase the species intelligence (no data is given on the post campaign IQ comparison). It is theorized that this difference is an additional reason for the lower occurrence of extinction events: because of their higher intelligence, the barast were able to recognize far earlier in their civilization that over-hunting would deplete a species. The climate in the barast world is also somewhat cooler, because of the lack of greenhouse gases compared to the gliksins' Earth. Barasts are not as heat-tolerant as gliksins, probably because they evolved on a cooler Earth and also due to their greater muscle mass. As a result, tropical regions of their Earth are just as underpopulated as the polar regions on the gliksins' Earth. A significant story feature is the state of the Earth's magnetic field. In the barast world a reversal of polarity happened shortly before the story starts and caused no noticeable harm to the barasts. As to why the pole reversals are off by several years, it is ascribed to random small differences over the intervening 40,000 years. In the gliksin world it is happening as the stories take place; this has an effect on the minds of gliksins, whose brain structures are different from the barasts' (see Religion). =Language= With the use of computer-aided communication devices, readers get to see only a glimpse of barast language. A dooslarm basadlarm refers to something like a judicial preliminary hearing with a literal translation of \\"asking small before asking large.\\" The phrase Dusble korbul to kalbtadu is translated as \\"In a quantum-computing facility.\\" Barast language is rendered as English when the action takes place in the barast world. One aspect of the language which can be discerned through the use of words like \\"gristle!\\" and \\"marrowless bone\\" for curses is that this register of speech is derived directly from real-world items. The customary barast greeting is \\"Healthy day.\\" =Economy= Barast do not have a monetary economy. Each person is given what they need when they need it, and in turn is expected to work at providing a meaningful 'contribution' to society. No barast would ever dream of attempting to take more than they need from society, and because of their stable population, there are no issues with scarcity (the population level was stabilized at the point it was in order to prevent such issues from even developing). Barast always consider their work in terms of how it contributes to society, and any work which does not contribute sufficiently is stopped. This leads to a lack of knowledge in certain areas, such as astrophysics, as such pursuits are stopped once they ceased to produce meaningful improvements in ordinary life. This also leads to some over-specialization, as driving is considered a specialized contribution and how to do so is known only to public conveyors whose sole contribution is to taxi people from point to point or to drive public buses. Occasionally, a Barast may voluntarily remove themselves from society in order to continue work that has been deemed not meaningful or to protest when work is purposefully stopped as dangerous. This individual would move away from the community to an isolated area, and would thereafter support themselves. They would not be able to generally ask for assistance from the greater community, and would also in some cases remove their Alibi Archive implant as protest (so their life after leaving the community would not be recorded) or have it removed involuntarily (to prevent any further recording regarding dangerous work). This isolation is voluntary, and they can have visitors or opt to return to the community at any time, although returning requires that they resume providing a meaningful contribution (and cease any dangerous work, if that was the reason for leaving). =Medicine= Barast medicine has become largely automated, and most doctors, aside from first aid (excepting researchers), simply operate and maintain this technology. This technology is highly robust and is able to be adapted to Gliksin physiology fairly quickly after contact. A notable difference in medical practice is a result of the lack of squeamishness displayed by the Barast. Rather than using anesthesia for surgery, this technology uses direct neural blocks to cut off signals from any body part being operated on while the operation is performed in full view of the doctor and the patient being operated on. The Barast do not find this disturbing in the least, which one Gliksin theorizes is because, as they are still a civilization completely composed of active hunters, they have been exposed to such scenes since childhood. =Religion= The Barasts have no religion and no concept of religion. This is not due to a simple disbelief or worldwide atheism. The Barasts never had a religion and are not physically capable of believing in a god or gods or having religious experiences due to the structure of their brains. Prior to contact between the gliksins and the Barasts, the Barasts had no concept of a creator; an afterlife or souls never occurred to them. The Barasts do not understand how the gliksins can possibly believe in the stories their religions tell, and are sometimes frustrated with the gliksins' insistence of the truth of their beliefs. Nevertheless, the Barasts do accept religion as a part of who the gliksins are. The Barasts also do not believe that the universe had a beginning and do not adhere to the Big Bang theory. Instead, they believe the universe has always existed, and can point to scientific evidence and verified theory to back up this belief. They believe that the gliksin theories concerning an origin of the universe exist because of the gliksin need to believe in a creator, and thus a beginning, which biases gliksin science. The story ends before any large-scale intermingling and rationalization of the two races' science can begin, so the ultimate outcome of detailed comparison between these viewpoints is unknown.

Jean-Claude van Damme stars as Gibson Rickenbacker, a mercenary who battles a group of murderous marauders led by Fender Tremolo (Vincent Klyn) along the East coast of the United States in a post-apocalyptic future. The film is the first in Pyun's Cyborg Trilogy. It was followed by 1993's Knights (originally entitled The Kingdom of Metal: Cyborg Killer) and Omega Doom in 1997. Cyborg was followed by the sequels Cyborg 2 (1993) and Cyborg 3: The Recycler (1994). Plot A plague known as the living death cripples civilization. A small group of surviving scientists and doctors ‚Äî located in Atlanta, home of the CDC ‚Äî work on a cure to save what remains of humanity. To complete their work they need information stored on a computer system in New York City. Pearl Prophet volunteers for the dangerous courier mission and is made into a cyborg through surgical augmentation. Pearl, accompanied by bodyguard Marshall Strat, retrieves the data in New York but is pursued by the vicious Fender Tremolo and his gang of pirates. Fender wants the cure so he can have a monopoly on its production. Strat, badly injured while fighting the pirates, tells Pearl to leave him and find a mercenary, known as a \\"slinger\\", who can escort her to safety. She gets cornered but is saved by a slinger named Gibson Rickenbacker. After she explains her situation, they are overrun by Fender's gang, and Gibson is knocked out by falling debris. Fender demands that she accompany him to Atlanta or die. Fender's gang slaughters a family and steals their boat. They head south for Atlanta via the Intracoastal Waterway with the captive Pearl. Gibson, who had been tracking the pirates, arrives at the scene of slaughter later that night. A shadowy figure attacks him, but he disables her. She turns out to be Nady Simmons, a young woman who mistook him as a pirate. Nady, whose family was wiped out by the plague, joins Gibson. Gibson is less concerned with a cure for the plague than with killing Fender. Gibson and Nady trek southward through the wastelands, where bandits ambush them. Concerned for Nady, Gibson unsuccessfully attempts to convince her to stay away. After declining sex with Nady, Gibson reveals that all he cares about is revenge against Fender, who killed his lover and destroyed his chance to have a normal life and family. Intercepting Fender and his crew near Charleston, South Carolina, Gibson defeats most of his men, but Fender shoots him with an air rifle. Now nursing a gunshot wound, Gibson realizes Haley (his dead lover's younger sister whom Fender kidnapped) is now a loyal member of Fender's crew. He flees the pirates and ends up alone with Pearl and Nady. Pearl refuses to go with him ‚Äî she calculates that Gibson is not strong enough to defeat Fender and will be unable to get her to Atlanta safely. She says she will go along with Fender and lure him to his death in Atlanta, where she has resources at her disposal. Tired, wounded and badly outnumbered, Gibson flees with Nady through the sewer into a salt marsh, where they are pursued by the rest of the pirates and eventually separated from each other. Gibson is thoroughly beaten by Fender and crucified high on the mast of a beached, derelict ship. Haley lingers at the scene but still leaves with Fender. Gibson spends the night on the cross. In the morning, near death, he kicks the mast repeatedly with his dangling foot in a last fit of rage. The mast snaps, sending him crashing to the ground, his arms still tied and nailed to the cross. Finally, Nady appears out of the marsh to free him. Gibson and Nady intercept Fender once again in Atlanta, this time better prepared. Fender's gang is taken down one by one until he and Gibson face off. During their fight, Nady rushes Fender with a knife, but he stabs and kills her. Gibson in turn stabs Fender in the chest. Thinking him dead, Gibson embraces Haley, who, during the battle turned decisively against Fender. However, Fender gets back up, and they continue to battle in a nearby shed, where Gibson finally kills Fender by impaling him on a meat hook. Gibson and Haley escort Pearl to her final destination, before heading back off.

Both projects were planned to be shot simultaneously by Albert Pyun. Cannon, however, was in financial trouble and had to cancel deals with both Mattel and Marvel Entertainment Group, the owners of He-Man and Spider-Man, respectively. Cannon had already spent $2 million on costumes and sets for both films and decided to start a new project in order to recoup that money. Pyun wrote the storyline for Cyborg in one weekend. Pyun had Chuck Norris in mind for the lead, but co-producer Menahem Golan cast Jean-Claude van Damme. The film was shot for less than $500,000 and was filmed in 23 days.Loreti, Nicanor. Interview with Albert Pyun. La Cosa Fantastico #113 (July 2005). Retrieved on September 6, 2010. The film was shot entirely in Wilmington, North Carolina. Several of the characters' names are references to well-known manufacturers and models of guitars and other musical instruments. *Gibson Rickenbacker: Gibson, Rickenbacker *Fender Tremolo: Fender, Tremolo arm *Marshall Strat: Marshall Amplifiers, Fender Stratocaster *Les: Gibson Les Paul *Pearl Prophet: Pearl drums, Prophet 5 synthesizer *Nady Simmons: Nady Systems, Inc. and Simmons electric drums After the success of Bloodsport, Cannon films offered Jean-Claude van Damme the lead in Delta Force 2, American Ninja 3 or Cyborg. He chose the latter although he later admitted \\"I didn't like [the film] so much.\\" Jackson \\"Rock\\" Pinckney, who played one of Fender's pirates, lost an eye during filming when Jean-Claude van Damme accidentally struck his eye with a prop knife. Pinckney sued Van Damme in a North Carolina court and was awarded $485,000. Violent scenes were heavily cut to gain an R rating rather than an X, including a throat-slitting and some blood and gore during the village massacre. Also excised was the death of a man Van Damme was fighting, which caused an inconsistency that made him look like he suddenly disappeared. Reception Cyborg received a generally negative reception from critics despite the box office success. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports a 19% positive score based on 16 reviews and an average rating of 2.93/10. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 24 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". The film debuted at number four at the American box office and went on to gross $10,166,459. Legacy =Sequels= Cyborg 2, starring Elias Koteas and Angelina Jolie, was released in 1993. Cyborg 3: The Recycler, a direct-to- video release, followed in 1995. Both films bear little to no relation to the first film and were heavily panned by critics, even more than the original. =Alternate cut= In 2011, director Albert Pyun's Curnan Pictures got hold of the missing tapes of the original cut of Cyborg through Pyun's original choice for score artist, Tony Riparetti. This director's cut of the film features Pyun's editing and previously unreleased scenes. It is commercially available through the director himself. Pyun's director's cut was released in 2014 in Germany with the film's original title \\"Slinger\\". =In popular culture= American rapper Method Man sampled most of Fender's opening words as the opening lyrics in the song \\"Judgement Day\\" from his 1998 album Tical 2000: Judgement Day. The lyrics are slightly modified. The intro is also in the opening of the song \\"World Damnation\\" by the death metal band Mortician. The intro of Fender talking about death and starvation is thought as the official opening of metal band Chimairas' song \\"Resurrection.\\" It is often played at live shows as an intro. The same intro is also played the beginning of a song by Australian, Christian, gore-grindcore band Vomitorial Corpulence.

He was also thought to be an alchemist (his house in Montpellier, France, had a carved door showing a roaring lion and dragon that bit his tail, also known as Ouroboros, both recognized alchemical symbols). The fact that several renown alchemists recognized him as an adept reinforces the thesis that he was an alchemist. He was also, like most wisemen of his time, an astrologer. He was born in the Crown of Aragon, probably Villanueva de Jiloca (Aragon) or Valencia, and he studied medicine and he also took some courses of theology. After living at the court of Aragon and teaching for many years in the Montpellier School of Medicine, he went to Paris, where he gained a considerable reputation; but he incurred the enmity of ecclesiastics. In 1311 he was summoned to Avignon by Pope Clement V, but he died on the voyage off the coast of Genoa. He is credited with translating a number of medical texts from Arabic, including works by Ibn Sina Avicenna, Abu-l-Salt, and Galen.D. Campbell, Arabian Medicine and Its Influence on the Middle Ages, p. 5. Many alchemical writings, including Rosarius Philosophorum, Novum Lumen, or Flos Florum, are also ascribed to him, but they are not authentic. Collected editions of them were published at Lyon in 1504 and 1532 (with a biography by Symphorianus Campegius), at Basel in 1585, and at Lyon in 1686. He is also the reputed author of important medical works, such as Speculum medicinae and Regimen sanitatis ad regem Aragonum, but many others, such as Breviarium Practicae, were falsely attributed to him. In addition, he wrote many theological works for the reformation of Christianity in Latin and in Catalan, some of them including apocalyptical prophecies. Biography Generic portrait of Arnald[us] de villa noua, woodcut from the Nuremberg Chronicle, 1493 Thesoro de los pobres (1584). Arnaldus' place and date of birth are debated: some historians believe he was born in Villeneuve-l√®s-Maguelone, a village near Montpellier; others are doubtful, because there are also towns of the same name in Aragon, in the Kingdom of Valencia (now in Spain), in Catalonia, in Languedoc, in Provence. Regardless, he is known in Catalonia, Valencia, and Balearic Islands by the name \\"Arnau de Vilanova,\\" and it is certain that he wrote most of his works in Valencian (Confessi√≥ de Barcelona, Raonament d'Aviny√≥). Whatever the reality, Arnaldus had a great reputation as a doctor, theologian and alchemist.Arnauld de VILLENEUVE (Arnau de Vilanova ou Arnaldus de Villanova). M√©decin, th√©ologien, diplomate, astrologue et alchimiste catalan He studied medicine in Montpellier until 1260. He wandered France, Catalonia, and Italy, as part doctor, part ambassador. He was the personal doctor of the King of Aragon from 1281. At the death of Peter III of Aragon in 1285, he left Barcelona for Montpellier. Influenced by Joachim of Fiore, he claimed that in 1378 the world would end and the Antichrist would come (De adventu Antichristi, 1288). He was condemned by the University of Paris in 1299, accused of heresy, and imprisoned for his ideas of church reform. He was saved through the intervention of Boniface VIII, whom Arnaldus had cured of a painful illness.Robert E. Lerner, ‚ÄúThe Pope and the Doctor,‚Äù The Yale Review 78, no. 1 (Autumn 1988): 62‚Äì79. He was once again imprisoned in Paris around 1304, under pope Benedict XI. The Sorbonne ordered his philosophical works to be burned. He was the master of the school of medicine between 1291 and 1299. His fame as a doctor was immense: among his patients were three popes and three kings. He was the first physician that used alcohol as an antiseptic. He became ambassador for James II, king of Aragon and Sicily. He sought refuge from the Inquisition at the court of Frederick III in Sicily, and was later called to Avignon as doctor for pope Clement V. He is certainly behind the papal bull of 8 September 1309, which required of medical students knowledge of some fifteen Greco-Arabic treatises, including ones by Galen and Avicenna. He died in a shipwreck near Genoa in 1311 while on a diplomatic mission. The inquisitor of Tarragona condemned him, and fifteen of his propositions were censured. A list of writings is given by J. Ferguson in his Bibliotheca Chemica (1906). See also U. Chevalier, Repertoire des sources hist., &c.;, Bio-bibliographie (Paris, 1903).

History Wildberg was founded by County of Hohenberg around 1281 at the foot of a castle built around 1200 by the County Palatine of T√ºbingen. Over the course of the 14th century, Wildberg became a possession of the Electoral Palatinate, who sold it and the towns of Sch√∂nbronn, Sulz am Eck, and G√ºltlingen to the County of W√ºrttemberg in 1440. The latter town would not be fully controlled by W√ºrttemberg until 1445, when it purchased the properties of other local nobles. These towns would exist in their own district until 1807, when the government of the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg assigned them to , which was dissolved in 1938 and replaced by Landkreis Calw. After World War II, Effringen, G√ºltlingen and Sulz am Eck established new residential areas but it was not until the 1970s that Wildberg also began growing. In 1971, Sch√∂nbronn merged into Wildberg and was followed four years later by Effringen, G√ºltlingen and Sulz am Eck. Growth slows in G√ºltlingen, Sch√∂nbronn, and Sulz am Eck, but continued in Wildberg into the 1990s. Geography The township (Stadt) of Wildberg is situated on the eastern edge of the district of Calw, in the German state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, and lies along the border with the district of B√∂blingen to the east. Wildberg is physically located in the valley of the Enz, between the Northern Black Forest to the west and the to the east. Elevation above sea level in the municipal area ranges from a high of Normalnull (NN) to a low of NN. Portions of the Federally protected , , and nature reserves are located in Wildberg's municipal area. Politics Wildberg has five boroughs (Ortsteile) ‚Äì Effringen, G√ºltlingen, Sch√∂nbronn, Sulz am Eck, and Wildberg ‚Äì and nine villages: Haselstaller H√∂fe, K√§pflesh√∂fe, Kengelh√∂fe, Lerchenberg, Obere Papierm√ºhle, Reuthin, Tr√∂lleshof, Untere Papierm√ºhle, and Untere S√§gm√ºhle. Also located in the municipal area are the minor administrative area of Ziegelh√ºtte and the abandoned villages of Berfeldingen, Gaisburg, and Weiler. =Coat of arms= The municipal coat of arms of Wildberg is divided party per fess into an upper, white half containing a black , and a lower, red half containing a white \\"W\\". The fields and the overall red-white tincture are taken from the arms of the Counts of Hohenberg and first began appearing in town seals in 1297. The \\"W\\" became a local motif some time before 1660, first appearing in local seals in 1593. The stag antler is also a long-lived local motif and was first used around 1612. The municipal coat of arms was approved on 26 January 1976 by the Federal Ministry of the Interior and a municipal flag issued to Wildberg. Transportation Wildberg is connected to Germany's network of roadways by and its system of railways by Nagold Valley Railway.

Located in Phoenix, Arizona, the zoo was founded by Robert Maytag, a member of the Maytag family, and operates on of land in the Papago Park area of Phoenix. It has been designated as a Phoenix Point of Pride. The zoo has over 1,400 animals on display and contains of walking trails. It is divided into four main themed areas or trails: The Arizona Trail (American Southwest flora and fauna), the Africa Trail (animals from Africa), the Tropics Trail (residents of the rain forests), and the Children's Trail, which includes a petting zoo. The zoo has been conservation minded from its inception. Soon after it opened it hosted what was thought to be the last few Arabian oryx, which formed the basis of the world herd created for Operation Oryx and eventually allowed the reintroduction of the species into the wild. It now includes a sanctuary to care for animals that are endangered or unwanted. History The Phoenix Zoo began as a personal project of Robert Maytag, who formed the Arizona Zoological Society (now the Arizona Center for Nature Conservation) with the intention of opening a zoo in Phoenix; before this time, there were a few modest proposals to establish a zoo in the fast- growing city, but none moved past the discussion stage. Although Maytag died unexpectedly a few months before its opening, the zoo opened on schedule in November 1962. It was originally named the \\"Maytag Zoo\\", but was renamed the following year to \\"Phoenix Zoo\\" to identify it more closely with the community. The zoo was established on the site of a fish hatchery operation built as a Works Progress Administration project in the 1930s, and operated by the Arizona Game and Fish Department until 1959. The zoo has always been a privately owned, non-profit venture.Papago Park: A History of Hole-in-the-Rock from 1848 to 1995, Pueblo Grande Museum Occasional Papers No. 1, by Jason H. Gart, 1997. African Savanna habitat Although the zoo had some financial struggles in the early 1960s, it grew substantially during the 1970s as it added numerous new exhibits, landscaping features, and visitor amenities. The 1980s saw continued growth, with the addition of African Savanna habitat areas, a children's zoo, a new entrance complex, and other exhibits. During this time, the zoo also underwent a renovation project to divide it into four themed zones (called \\"trails\\"), featuring different types of exhibits. The zoo expanded again in 1998 with the opening of Harmony Farms, home to a petting zoo and many domestic farm animals. In 2000, the zoo opened Desert Lives, and in 2004 it added a new primate walk-through exhibit called Monkey Village. In November 2006, aquatic species were added to the zoo with the opening of Stingray Bay,. In November 2009, two Komodo dragons were brought to the zoo as a part of the zoo's capital campaign. In April 2011, as a part of the zoo's capital campaign, Orang-Hutan: People of the Forest, the new orangutan exhibit opened to the public. Areas and attractions The Phoenix Zoo has four major themed areas, or \\"trails\\", where visitors can experience exhibits representing different areas of the world and their native wildlife: the Arizona Trail, the Africa Trail, the Tropics Trail, and the Discovery/Children's Trail. =Arizona Trail= The Arizona Trail is designed to emulate the wildlife and plant life of the state of Arizona. It features several plants native to the Sonoran Desert including the saguaro cactus, and animals such as the coyote, collared peccary (more commonly known as the javelina), cougar, bobcat, raven, turkey vulture, coati, thick billed parrot, Sonoran pronghorn, and the Mexican wolf. =Africa Trail= The Africa Trail showcases many of the most popular animals in the world, including the African painted dogs, hamadryas baboon, mandrill, ostrich, Mhorr's gazelle, white rhino, Gr√©vy's zebras, lions, cheetahs, Reticulated and Masai giraffes. The Desert Lives (pronounced like \\"life\\") trail, diverts off of the Africa Trail before and after the lion and hyena exhibits, and features bighorn sheep and Arabian oryx among the natural buttes. =Tropics Trail= The Tropics Trail has two parts. The inner trail following the lake is home to the \\"Tropical Flights\\" aviary as well as Bornean orangutans and the common squirrel monkeys of \\"Monkey Village\\". The outer tropics trail passes by the Komodo dragons in the \\"Land of the Dragons\\" exhibit, Asian elephants, jaguar, Gal√°pagos tortoises, Aldabra giant tortoises, iguanas, anteaters, Sumatran tigers of the \\"Isle of the Tiger\\" exhibit, and an assortment of tropical birds. It includes the Forest of Uco, a lush rainforest landscape that surrounds visitors along a 1-mile walking trail and includes reproductions of a South American mercado and a scientific expedition and ruins, and highlights several tropical animals including the Andean bear. =Children's Trail= The Children's Trail lets children get close to many small animals from around the world, including emus, an ocelot, a caracal, siamang gibbons, and golden lion tamarins. Next to the Wallaby Walkabout is a rectangular display called \\"Feel the Difference\\", with three vertebrate charts (reptile, fish, and amphibian), and an invertebrate chart created by Frank Schaffer Publications. Continuing on the trail will take you through Harmony Farm, featuring many farm animals, a petting zoo, and demonstrations on farming and agriculture oriented toward children. =Hunt Bass Hatchery House (\\"Ruby's House\\")= The Hunt Bass Hatchery Caretaker's House The Hunt Bass Hatchery Caretaker's House was built in 1936 and is located in the Phoenix Zoo grounds. Following the Great Depression, Governor George W. P. Hunt (Arizona's first elected governor) commissioned a bass fish hatchery to be established in Papago Park during 1932. The hatchery was built as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project. The hatchery, operated by the Arizona Game and Fish Department, was a success, and was in operation until 1959 (as it was considered obsolete by this time); around this time, the state of Arizona ceded the majority of Papago Park to the City of Phoenix. The City of Phoenix leased the hatchery grounds, including its man-made lakes, to the Arizona Zoological Society in 1962 to establish the Zoo. The hatchery property was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on January 23, 2003, reference: #02001723.Az Central The Caretaker's House was renovated in the late 1990s, and is now known as \\"Ruby's House\\", as it is dedicated to the memory of Ruby, the famous painting elephant at the zoo (see her biography below). Ruby's House has become a popular venue for weddings, receptions, and other special events. =Other attractions= In addition to the trails, the zoo has several specialty attractions. *Stingray Bay was opened in November 2006, and included more than 30 cownose rays and southern stingrays in a 15,000 gallon \\"touch tank.\\" The \\"touch tank\\" lets visitors to touch the rays, whose barbs have been trimmed for safety. The exhibit is now permanent after installation of equipment to adjust water temperatures in the summer. In October 2007, bamboo sharks were added to the exhibit. *An endangered species carousel is featured by the Leapin' Lagoon Splash Pad. *The Safari Train provides a nonstop guided tour of the zoo. *Camel rides. *Giraffe Encounter *ZooLights - an annual December lighting show, which began in 1991. =Programs= The zoo has a wide array of youth programs and animal encounters, including field trips, Night Camp, an outreach program which includes a zoomobile for outreach to locations outside the city, a summer camp, and a large volunteer program for teenagers 13‚Äì17, known as the Zooteen program. Palms near the zoo entrance Conservation efforts Since opening in 1962, the zoo has focused on animal conservation efforts. Programs at the Phoenix Zoo include captive breeding for reintroduction (for instance the Arabian oryx, black-footed ferret, Mexican wolf, Ramsey Canyon leopard frog, and thick-billed parrot, sanctuary for animals that are no longer breeding (for instance the African painted dogs at the zoo), and rescue and rehabilitation (for instance lead poisoning treatments for the California condor). The Phoenix Zoo participates in the Species Survival Plan (SSP) for 29 species with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The goal of the SSP is to engage in animal husbandry and research projects for selected species that are in need of conservation efforts. =Reintroduction= In its first years, the zoo hosted a captive breeding program (\\"Operation Oryx\\") with the specific goal of reintroducing the almost extinct Arabian oryx to the wild. By the early 1990s this program was still one of only two programs (the other being the golden lion tamarin) to have gone through the full wilderness-zoo- wilderness sequence. Nine oryx had been caught or donated for the breeding program. However, two pairs were delayed, so the \\"World Herd\\" was started in Phoenix in 1963 with only five animals shipped to the zoo and two born quickly after. The two delayed pairs arrived in 1964 to increase the herd to 11 individuals.Tudge, Colin: Last Animals At the Zoo, page 127. Island Press, 1992. The program was very successful, and the zoo celebrated its 225th Arabian oryx birth in 2002. The Arabian oryx became extinct in the wild in 1972,The Arabian Oryx Project ‚Äì Timeline and reintroduction efforts were started in 1982 when oryx were released to the wild in the Omani Central Desert and Coastal Hills. Additional captive herds have been discovered and used as the basis for reintroductions, for instance in Saudi Arabia, but there has been some interbreeding even with these herds and most of the Arabian oryx in the wild today have ancestors from the Phoenix Zoo. =Sanctuary= The zoo provides sanctuary to many animals that need a place to live for various reasons. Some (like the Arabian oryx, Bali mynah, rhinoceros hornbill, Mexican gray wolf, and white rhinoceros) participate in captive breeding programs, some (such as the African spotted dogs) have retired from such programs and need a home, some have behavioral problems, and some are being rehabilitated to return to the wild. Animals that are in of sanctuary are treated somewhat differently from other animals by the zoo. While normal exhibits balance the needs of the animals with those of visitors (for example, incorporating large viewing areas), the sanctuary exhibits are almost completely focused on the comfort and well-being of the animals. After the 1998 death of Ruby, the zoo's famous painting elephant, the zoo abandoned its elephant breeding program and began to focus on elephant behavior. The zoo is currently home to three Asian elephants that have a variety of behavioral issues, the most common being aggressive toward other elephants. One elephant is a former performer at a circus and was subject to mistreatment, while the other two were captured in remote regions where they were never properly socialized. =Rescue and rehabilitation= The zoo provides lead poisoning treatment for California condors from the Grand Canyon area. These birds are one of the most endangered species on the planet, having at one time been reduced to 22 individuals in the wild. In February 2006, they treated a female (#149) who had been released in the 1990s and her son (#304) who survived a very rare birth in the wild. Both birds were captured in the Grand Canyon region and brought back to the zoo to be treated. A California condor (#133) was still being treated for lead poisoning at the zoo as of March 2010. Ruby the elephant The Phoenix Zoo garnered worldwide attention for one of its animals, an Asian elephant named Ruby. Ruby came to the zoo in 1973, just months after being born in Thailand. After noticing Ruby doodling in the sand with sticks, her keeper decided to give her a brush and paint. Ruby quickly became known for her paintings, the sales of which raised over US$200,000 for the zoo. Art collectors all over the world joined 18-month waiting lists and paid hundreds of dollars for original prints. In 1997, Ruby became pregnant. Near the end of her 22-month pregnancy, veterinarians discovered that the calf was dead. Ruby's uterus had ruptured, and the calf had slipped out and into Ruby's abdomen. Due to complications during the surgery to remove the 320-pound fetus, Ruby had to be euthanized. Controversies A balancing act at the zoo In 1997, then-zoo director Jeff Williamson merged some departments of the zoo in a business move that was intended to provide a clearer direction for zoo operations. Many of the zoo's approximately 350 volunteers interpreted the merger as an elimination of volunteer training efforts. As a result, more than half of them left the zoo by 1999. In May 2005, a veterinarian named Kris Nelson filed a series of complaints against the zoo regarding animal care and management. Her complaints were backed by two former zoo employees: a chief veterinarian and an animal nutritionist. The complaints stated that dozens of animals had been harmed or died as a result of poor management, feeding practices, and quarantine procedures. Another veterinarian, 15-year zoo employee Kathy Orr, discounted many of Nelson's claims as being either invalid, or having been corrected already. The following June, an independent committee of zoological experts from other areas of the country cleared the Phoenix Zoo of the charges. In a published report, the committee outlined some minor flaws in the zoo's operation, but reported no \\"serious deficiencies\\". Fundraising for redesign A Phoenix municipal bond election in March 2006 provided $2 million to the project, marking the first time the zoo has received public funds in its history. On 8 June 2006, then-zoo director Jeff Williamson announced a major fund-raising drive over the next 10 years to update the zoo's infrastructure and many of its aging exhibits. The zoo needs to raise $70 million to complete the project. In 2009, a shorter term goal is to raise $20 million by 2012 to pay for a number of improvements that are already under way.

He was hanged at Newgate on 18 January 1803, shortly after which his body was taken to a nearby house where it was used in an experiment by Italian scientist Giovanni Aldini. At his trial the events were reconstructed. Forster's mother-in-law recounted that her daughter and grandchild had left her house to see Forster at 4 p.m. on Saturday, 4 December 1802. Joseph Bradfield, in whose house Forster lodged, reported that they had stayed together that night and gone out at 10 a.m. on the Sunday morning. He also stated that Forster and his wife had not been on good terms because she wished to live with him. Various witnesses saw Forster with his wife and child in public houses near Paddington Canal during the day on the Sunday. The body of his child was found on the Monday morning; after the canal was dragged for three days, his wife's body was also found. Forster claimed that upon leaving The Mitre he set out alone for Barnet in order to see his other two children who were in the workhouse there, though he was forced to turn back at Whetstone due to the failing light. This was contradicted by a waiter at The Mitre who said the three left the inn together. Scepticism was also expressed that he could have walked to Whetstone in the time he claimed. The jury found him guilty. He was sentenced to death and also to be dissected thereafter. This sentence was designed not only to provide medicine with corpses on which to experiment, but also to ensure that the condemned could not rise on Judgement Day, their bodies having been cut into pieces and selectively discarded. Forster was hanged on 18 January, shortly before which he made a full confession. He said he had come to hate his wife and had twice before taken his wife to the canal but his nerve had both times failed him. A recent BBC Knowledge documentary (Real Horror: Frankenstein) questions the fairness of the trial. It notes that friends of George Forster's wife later claimed that she was extremely suicidal and had often talked about killing herself and her daughter. According to this documentary, Forster attempted suicide by stabbing himself with a crudely fashioned knife. This was to avoid awakening during the dissection of his body, should he not have died when hanged. This was a real possibility owing to the crude methods of execution at the time. The same reference suggests that his 'confession' was obtained under duress. In fact, it alleges that Pass, a Beadle on Aldini's payroll, fast-tracked the whole trial and legal procedure in order to obtain the freshest corpse possible for his benefactor. An illustration of a galvanised corpseAfter the execution Forster's body was given to Giovanni Aldini for experimentation. Aldini was the nephew of fellow scientist Luigi Galvani and an enthusiastic proponent of his uncle's method of stimulating muscles with electric current, known as Galvanism. The experiment he performed on Forster's body was a demonstration of this technique. The Newgate Calendar (a record of executions at Newgate) reports that, \\"On the first application of the process to the face, the jaws of the deceased criminal began to quiver, and the adjoining muscles were horribly contorted, and one eye was actually opened. In the subsequent part of the process the right hand was raised and clenched, and the legs and thighs were set in motion.\\" Several of those present believed that Forster was being brought back to life (The Newgate Calendar reports that even if this had been so, he would have been re-executed since his sentence was to \\"hang until he be dead\\") and one man, Mr Pass, the beadle of the Surgeons' Company, was so shocked that he died shortly after leaving. The hanged man was certainly dead, since his blood had been drained and his spinal cord severed after the execution.

The village of Gorna krepost (\\"Upper Fortress\\") is located at the foot of the hill and the gold-bearing Perpereshka River flows nearby. Perperikon is the largest megalith ensemble site in the Balkans. The name \\"Perperikon\\" The name Perperikon dates from the Middle Ages ‚Äì 11th‚Äì13th centuries. The original name Hyperperakion was shortened by scribes to Perperakion or Perperikon. There are at least two theories about the origin and meaning of the name, both associating it with gold-mining: The city may have been named after a Medieval high-temperature gold-refining process (Medieval Greek hyperpyros), or the resumed use of a classical-era name for the site, derived from a word for altar-fire (ancient Greek hyperpyros). History left Human activity in the area dates back to 5000 BCE. The first traces of civilization on the hill date from the Bronze Age, while the ceramics found on the place date from the Early Iron Age, as well as the impressive round altar, almost 2 m in diameter, hewn out of the rocks. It is thought that a famous Temple of Dionysius was located at Perperikon during the classical era. Perperikon is the site from which Medokos declared himself the king of Thrace in 424 BCE, after Sitalces's death, but was overthrown. Bulgarian archaeologist Nikolay Ovcharov started the excavation works at Perperikon in 2000, and revealed the remains of ancient architectural complex. Archaeologists have uncovered a giant multi- story palace and an imposing fortress built around the hill, with walls as thick as 2.8 m. This dates from the time of the Roman Empire. Temples and residential quarters were also constructed in the fortress. The megalithic complex has been laid in ruins and re-erected many times throughout history. A 2.4 million Euro visitor centre is being constructed with funds provided by the EU. Church The Perpericon church site A church pulpit was found by Bulgarian archeologists at the peak of the Thracian rock sanctuary on 10 September 2005. It is thought to be the first found in Bulgaria. The pulpit was probably built at the end of the 4th century CE or the early 5th century during the reign of Byzantine Arcadius and coincided with the period of the christening of the Thracians in the Rhodopes area. The church foundations are laid out in the form of a single nave basilica of 16.5 m length, which is the most typical form of an early Christian temple. The pulpit is exceptionally well preserved and is richly decorated with ornaments incised on the stone, including a clearly-visible eagle with outstreached wings. It also bears five inscriptions in Greek. Gallery Image:Perperikon, grobnitsa na vladetelite.jpgThe tombs of the rulers. File:Perperikon-Medieval- Walls.jpgOther ancient buildings in Perperikon.

History  Dickerson Park was established by the Springfield Park Board in 1922 and developed with the aid of Works Progress Administration (WPA) labor and funds in the 1930s. From then until the 1970s, very little development or support occurred, and by 1975, the zoo became rundown. It was on the verge of being closed, but a commitment was made by the City of Springfield, and a support group was created known as Friends of the Zoo, to save the zoo. The Friends organization developed a membership base, launched education programs and gathered support from donors for new projects and improvements. The City of Springfield committed budget dollars and instituted an admission fee to help offset expenses. The zoo's mission had the objectives of advancing recreation, education, conservation and research. A master plan, adopted in 1985, visualized a new zoo, with geographic themes and phased development. The zoo became involved in Species Survival Plans, most notably Asian elephants, maned wolves and cheetahs. In-house and outreach education programs were offered to the community. The growth of tourism in the region contributed to increases in attendance and offered visitors to the community another attraction when visiting the Ozarks. An update and revision of the master plan for the park was completed in 1996. Accidents and incidents On October 4, 2013, the zoo euthanized one of its four elephants, the matriarch, a 41-year- old female known as Connie (AKA Pinky), who had been suffering from kidney disease and had lost nearly 1,000 pounds. Later, on October 11, another one of the zoo's elephants named Patience, (who had been reported as \\"hesitant and submissive\\" since the death of its Matriarch,) made a sudden movement and killed the zoo's head of elephants zookeeper John Bradford, age 62, who had been with the zoo since 1990. It is thought that Patience, (not understanding the reason for the euthanasia,) may have blamed the head zookeeper for Connie's death.

He was joined by Anthony Bautovich (Lonely Hearts), Mitch Easter (an American indie producer- manager) on vocals, and Ken Stringfellow (The Posies) on lead vocals. The group issued two albums, Assorted Creams (1997) and Humblin' (Across America) (2001) before disbanding later that year. They reformed in March 2012 and issued a third album, Depressing Beauty, in May 2015. Biography The Orange Humble Band's founding mainstay, Darryl Mather (ex-Lime Spiders (1979‚Äì82)), had returned to the music scene in 1994, following a three-year absence after the break-up of his previous band, The Someloves (1986‚Äì90). He had more than an album's worth of new songs, which he took to his friend, Bill Gibson. Early in 1995 Mather with Gibson on bass guitar formed The Orange Humble Band in Sydney. Recording of their debut album, Assorted Creams, started at 48 Volts and Charing Cross Studios, Sydney, with Anthony Bautovich (ex-Lonely Hearts) on vocals, Matt Galvin on lead guitar and Peter Kelly on drums. The final recordings took place in Mitch Easter's studios in North Carolina at Brickhenge and Reflection Studios in October 1996. Easter provided vocals, prior to Ken Stringfellow (ex-The Posies) being recruited. Assorted Creams was released in 1997 on the Half a Cow label in Australia, and on 14 July 1998 in the United States. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described it as \\"full of chiming guitars and sunshine-drenched 1960s melodies.\\" James Chrispell of AllMusic found it was \\"a decidedly updated version of good-time music. Song after song comes along with a great melody and some interesting hippie-esque lyrics; here, there, and everywhere, there are hooks, hooks, and more hooks.\\" The album provided their first single, \\"Apple Green Slice Cut\\", in August 1998, which was followed by a five-track extended play, Down in Your Dreams. Alongside the title track, Chrispell felt the group \\"enhance their musical knowledge of pop by adding four extra tracks that vary in length and sound... A very nice added bonus for anyone who has picked up on one of Australia's little secrets of joy.\\" One of its tracks, \\"Step on the Gas\\", had appeared on a Various Artist's compilation album, Cop It Sweet, on Antfarm Records in 1997. The band's second album, Humblin‚Äô (Across America) appeared in 2001, with work commencing on it eighteen months earlier. The line-up of Mather, Bautovich, Easter and Stringfellow were joined by Jody Stephens (Big Star, Golden Smog) on drums and Jamie Hoover (The Spongetones) on bass guitar. Spooner Oldham (Dan Penn, Aretha Franklin, Neil Young), and Jim Dickinson provided organ and piano on several tracks. Carmine Pascuzzi of Mediasearch website determined that \\"the listener is taken on an engaging journey. The whole exercise works cohesively. The country rock and rootsy atmospheres are very simple and effective, from the adept musicianship.\\" Ahead of the album, in 2000, they issued a single, \\"Any Way You Want It\\", which included three non-album B-sides. By the end of the following year the group had disbanded. In March 2012 Mather attended a preview of a documentary, Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me, at SXSW as guest of Stephens, where together with Easter and Stringfellow they agreed to reform The Orange Humble Band. Mather returned to Australia to write songs for a new album. Whilst preparing material, he contacted Dwight Twilley with a view to recording the latter's song, \\"You Close Your Eyes\\". Twilley agreed and additionally offered to help Mather write bridge sections for two of the new tracks and to appear as a guest backing vocalist. The Orange Humble Band recorded their third album in October 2012 at Ardent Studios in Memphis, which was produced by Easter.

Founded in 1982 by Steve and Linda Kuntz, the organization provides educational programs on wolves, engages in wolf-related activism, and operates a sanctuary that houses displaced, captive-born wolves. It also fosters and participates in captive-breeding programs for two highly endangered types of wolves, the red wolf and the Mexican wolf. Wolf Haven is one of three facilities in the United States that provides pre-release housing for Mexican gray wolves bred for Southwest restoration programs. Over 55 animals are harbored at its refuge, and a smaller public area can be toured by visitors with reservations. These include gray wolves, Mexican wolves, red wolves, wolfdogs and two coyotes. With the recent acquisition of a second wolf sanctuary in Bridger, Montana, which has 35 wolves, Wolf Haven International cares for a total of 95 animals. History =Foundation= Steve and Linda Kuntz, who are considered the founders of Wolf Haven International, first became involved with wolves after purchasing a wolf pup while living in Colorado in 1978, having no idea that wolves were endangered at the time. They would later meet and befriend Ed Andrews and his wife, two naturalists who ran Wolf Country Foundation, an educational organization that also provided homes for eight wolves in their care. The wolves had been acquired from research programs, federal agencies, and the Fairbanks Zoo after it went bankrupt and ceased operation. In 1980, the Andrews moved from Colorado, stating it was too expensive to operate there. At the time, the Colorado wildlife authorities stated that they had begun investigating the couple's activities, which were halted by their moving. The couple originally went to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, but were denied a permit to import the wolves into the area and were forced to leave. The Andrews then moved to Washington state, setting up their compound on of land in South Prairie. Their neighbors, primarily ranchers, objected to the new facility, and complained that the wolves were noisy. One neighbor killed two of the Andrews pet Doberman Pinschers, claiming the dogs were on his land and had killed his wife's cat. Though the facility was legal by state standards, the city passed an ordinance requiring the Andrews to obtain their neighbors' approval for it. The city later passed an ordinance making it illegal to own wolves, so the group packed up once again, relocating to Tenino, Washington (near Olympia), with its now 22-strong pack of wolves. With thousands of yards between the wolf pens and the nearest neighbors, the group was able to settle in and find acceptance on land donated by an anonymous supporter. The Kuntzes joined the Andrews as their assistants, and the volunteers of Wolf Haven continued giving educational lectures and caring for captive-bred wolves needing homes. After Wolf Haven's arrival, Washington also made it illegal to own wolves, but the organization was granted an exemption. In early 1982, the Andrews turned the organization over to the Kuntzes, who incorporated it as a nonprofit organization, Wolf Haven America, on September 10, 1982. Operated by volunteers, it continued focusing on the dual purposes of education and housing wolves that might otherwise be destroyed. By 1990, the group was renamed Wolf Haven International, to reflect its dedication to wolves around the world, and expanded to have a dedicated board of directors and paid staff positions. According to the organization, it has provided a home to over 250 wolves that were rescued from \\"roadside zoos, animal collectors, private owners, research and other facilities.\\" In 2018, Wolf Haven acquired a second existing wolf sanctuary, formerly known as the McCleery Buffalo Wolf Foundation, located in Bridger, Montana. Now called the McCleery Ranch, the sanctuary is home to 35 wolves. Organizational model Wolf Haven International operates under a license issued by the USDA. Staffed primarily by volunteers and 16 paid staff, its overall operations are managed by a board of directors, led by an executive director. Activities Wolf Haven International was accredited by the American Sanctuary Association (ASA) in 2014 and the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries (GFAS) in 2015. Wolf Haven is the only wolf sanctuary in the world to earn global accreditation. The photo essay book Wolf Haven: Sanctuary and the Future of Wolves in North America, with photos by Annie Marie Musselman and essay by Brenda Peterson, was published by Sasquatch Books in 2016. A follow-up children's book by the same people, called Lobos, A Wolf Family Returns to the Wild, told the true story of a family of Mexican gray wolves born at Wolf Haven and released into the wild in Mexico. According to The Olympian, Wolf Haven International is \\"one of the top wolf sanctuaries in the country\\". When the center first opened, it housed 22 wolves. By 1991, it was up to 36 wolves, and in 2006 the compound housed 47 wolves. Approximately 12,000 visitors tour the facility each year. A variety of wolves are kept in residence, including, gray wolves, Mexican gray wolves, and red wolves. There are also some wolfdogs. While wolves generally live 4‚Äì9 years in the wild, those at Wolf Haven International have lived to reach 15‚Äì19 years of age. Wolf Haven publishes a quarterly magazine, Wolf Tracks, which is distributed to donating members. The Winter 2009 issue won an APEX Award for Publication Excellence in the \\"One-of-a-Kind Scientific & Environmental Publications\\".

Since the entry into force of the \\"Kallikratis\\" reform on 1 January 2011, there are 325 municipalities. Thirteen administrative regions form the second-level unit of government. The regions consist of 74 regional units, which mostly correspond to the old prefectures. Regional units are then divided into municipalities. The new municipalities may be subdivided into municipal units (Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒøœÑŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ ŒµŒΩœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒµœÇ, dimotik√©s en√≥tites), consisting of the pre-Kallikratis municipalities. These were further subdivided into municipal communities (Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒøœÑŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ Œ∫ŒøŒπŒΩœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒµœÇ, dimotik√©s koin√≥tites) and local communities (œÑŒøœÄŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ Œ∫ŒøŒπŒΩœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒµœÇ, topik√©s koin√≥tites) according to population, but are simply named communities (Œ∫ŒøŒπŒΩœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒµœÇ, koin√≥tites) since the entry into force of the \\"Cleisthenes I\\" reform on 1 September 2019. Constitutional provisions for communities and municipalities Article 102 of the Greek constitution outlines the mandate of municipalities and communities and their relationship to the larger State: *Municipalities and communities exercise administration of local affairs independently. *Leadership of municipalities and communities is elected by universal and secret ballot. *Municipalities may voluntarily or be mandated by law to work together to provide certain services, but elected representatives from the participating groups govern these partnerships. *The national Greek government supervises local government agencies, but is not to interfere in any local initiatives or actions. *The State is required to provide funds necessary to fulfill the mandate of local government agencies. Organization of communities and municipalities Administrative division of Greece following the \\"Kallikratis\\" reform: each colour denotes a region, regional units are outlined in black, and municipalities in white Communities are governed by a council (œÉœÖŒºŒ≤ŒøœçŒªŒπŒø, symvo√∫lio) made up of 7 to 11 members and led by a president (œÄœÅœåŒµŒ¥œÅŒøœÇ Œ∫ŒøŒπŒΩœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒ±œÇ, pr√≥edros koin√≥titas). A deputy chairperson from a communal quarter (if the community has been further divided) may also take part in council meetings when specific issues of a communal interest are being discussed. Municipalities are governed by a municipal council (Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒøœÑŒπŒ∫œå œÉœÖŒºŒ≤ŒøœçŒªŒπŒø, dimotik√≥ symvo√∫lio) and municipal consultation committee (Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒøœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒµœÄŒπœÑœÅŒøœÄŒÆ Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ≤ŒøœçŒªŒµœÖœÉŒ∑œÇ, dimotik√≠ epitrop√≠ diavo√∫lefsis), led by a mayor (Œ¥ŒÆŒºŒ±œÅœáŒøœÇ, d√≠marchos). Depending on the size of the municipality, municipal councils are made up of anywhere from 11 to 41 council members representing \\"municipal departments\\" (many of which were small communities that had been merged into the municipality). In addition, the council elects 2 to 6 town hall committee members. In the case of mergers, local village or town councils (like communal quarters) may still exist to provide feedback and ideas to the larger governing body. Council members are elected via public election every four years on the basis of a party system. Three-fifths of all seats go to the party winning a plurality of the vote and the remaining two-fifths of the seats go to other parties based on their share of the vote on a proportional basis. The municipal council elects the town hall committee for a term of two years. The State ultimately oversees the actions of local governments, but the Municipal and Communal Code still provides communities and municipalities with legal control over the administration of their designated areas. Participation of citizens in local decision-making Citizens have very few opportunities for direct participation in decision-making outside the elections held every four years. Beyond national referendums that may be called for critical issues, citizens cannot request local referendums. The only other possibility for direct input by citizens is if the local municipality establishes district councils or if the community president calls a people's assembly to discuss issues of concern. The organization of these public opportunities, however, is solely at the discretion of the community or municipal leadership. Responsibilities of municipal governments The Municipal and Communal Code (art. 24) states that municipalities and communities have responsibility for the administration of their local jurisdiction as it pertains to the social, financial, cultural and spiritual interests of its citizens. More specifically, communities and municipalities have responsibility for the following: *Security and police *Fire fighting *Civil protection *Nurseries and kindergartens *Repair and maintenance of all schools, including the issuing of permits *Adult education *Hospitals and health departments *Family and youth services *Rest homes *Public housing and town planning *Water and waste treatment *Cemeteries *Environmental protection *Theatres, museums, libraries *Parks, sports and leisure facilities *Urban road systems *Gas supplies *Irrigation *Farming and fishing *Commerce and tourism *Licensing certain business enterprises Local government finances Revenues come from both ordinary and extraordinary sources. Ordinary revenue is derived from the State budget, property revenues, and established taxes and fees. By law, the State funds first level governments on the basis of a fixed formula: 20% of legal persons‚Äô income tax, 50% of traffic duties and 3% of property transfer duties. For smaller populated communities and municipalities, the State has also allocated additional revenue based on other expenses (e.g. the cost of supplying water, maintaining road networks, and climate). Local governments are required to direct any property or resource fees to related expenses (e.g. drinking water fees must go towards the maintenance and improvement of the water system). Other forms of taxation or fines (e.g. parking fees) can be used wherever the government deems necessary. Extraordinary revenue originates from sources like loans, inheritances, auctions, rents and fines. Income generation is not limited to traditional service sources. Local governments can also initiate or participate in entrepreneurial activities that include a wide range of possible partnerships. Each year communities and municipalities formulate their budgets in terms of expected revenues and expenses. Financial management and auditing is then based on this plan. History of community and municipal governments *In 1831, the first governor of independent Greece, Ioannis Capodistrias administratively reorganized the Peloponnese into seven departments and the islands into six. These departments were then subdivided into provinces and, in turn, into towns and villages. Opponents of these reforms later assassinated Capodistrias. *The Constitution of 1952 (article 99) clearly identified the administrative role of municipal and community authorities. *The Constitution of the Hellenic Republic was established in 1975 and in article 102 stated that the first level of government were those of communities and municipalities. *Law 1416 was passed in 1984 to reinforce municipal authority over local government. *In 1986, the Constitution was modified with the addition of articles 101 and 102 that established local government parameters and relationships. *Presidential Decree 410 (Municipal and Communal Code) codified the legislation concerning municipalities and communities in 1995. *Law 2539 in 1997, named ‚ÄúIoannis Kapodistrias,‚Äù took 441 municipalities and the 5382 communities and merged them into 900 municipalities and 133 communities. Newly merged municipalities and communities could further subdivide their territory into municipal or communal departments to give some local authority to merged areas. *Law 2647 in 1998 transferred responsibilities from the State to local authorities. *Law 3852 in 2010, named ‚ÄúKallikratis,‚Äù took the 900 municipalities and the 133 communities and merged them into 325 municipalities. The new municipalities can subdivide their territory into municipal or local communities.

The team was founded in 1904 as VG Oostende and has the matricule No. 31. History In 1911, another club was created, AS Oostende, which would soon become the best club of the city, playing regularly in the second division in the 1930s. In the mid 1970s, AS reached the first division while VG was playing at the second level. The two clubs merged in 1981 to become KV Oostende. The new club played in the third division for eleven years, before finally promoting. In its first season on the second level, Oostende immediately promoted again, to the first division, where it would achieve its best result in the club history: a seventh place, in 1993‚Äì94. From 1995 to 2013, Oostende has been playing in the second division, except in 1998‚Äì99 and 2004‚Äì05, when it was at the higher level again, and in 2001‚Äì02 and 2002‚Äì03, when it played in the third division. In 1982, one year after the merger, VG Oostende had been re- founded at the lowest level of the Belgian football competition. The club first used the Armenonville stadium, which was the original ground of VG. In 2001, the stadium was declared unsafe, so the club had to groundshare with KV Oostende in the Albertparkstadion, until 2010. In 2013, the new VG Oostende also disappeared, after a financial breakdown. In August 2013, shortly after a new promotion to the highest level, it was announced that chairman and majority shareholder Yves Lejaeghere would be succeeded by a new chairman, businessman Marc Coucke. In the spring of 2016, the main tribune of the Albertparkstadion was rebuilt and the stadium was renamed the Versluys Arena with the capacity increased to 8,432.

It is very similar to the red-eyed damselfly. Appearance Eyes The species is a small damselfly, about long, predominantly black with iridescent blue markings. Its large, spaced eyes are a deep red. Like the red-eyed damselfly, both sexes lack pale spots behind the eyes and have pale brown pterostigmata. The male has a bronze-black top and blue sides. The sides of the female's thorax are yellow, green or blue. The rear edge of the pronotum is rounded. Viewed from the side, the second and eighth segment of the abdomen of the male are mostly blue, which distinguishes it from the red-eyed damselfly where these are mostly black. Breeding This damselfly breeds in ponds, lakes and ditches and, in continental Europe, sluggish rivers. It seems to be well able to tolerate brackish water. It seems to be associated with floating vegetation such as Hornwort and Water Milfoil (Myriophyllum). Eggs are laid while in tandem, into the stems and leaves of floating plants. The larvae live amongst pondweed and probably emerge after a year. Behaviour Comparison between males of Erythromma viridulum (top) and Erythromma najas (bottom); notice the differences in the distribution of the blue markings Mating occurs either on floating plants or at the margins. When perched on floating plants, the male holds its abdomen slightly upcurved (the red-eyed damselfly holds it straight). Colonisation of Britain The populations of this species in northwest Europe increased in the latter part of the 20th century, and in 1999 the species was recorded in Britain for the first time. It has since increased its range considerably and become an established breeding resident. The first British record was in Essex on 17 July 1999 and is documented in Dewick and Gerussi (2000). Breeding was finally proven in 2002.

He is an Honorary Research Fellow in the School of Government and International Affairs at Durham University. He is known as an essayist and a scholar of nationalism. Life Nairn was born on 2 June 1932 in Freuchie, Fife. He attended Dunfermline High School and the Edinburgh College of Art before graduating from the University of Edinburgh with an MA in Philosophy in 1956. During the 1960s he taught at various institutions including the University of Birmingham (1965-6). He came to national prominence as a lecturer at Hornsey College of Art during 1968, involved in a student occupation.What happened at Hornsey in May 1968 ‚Äî Nick Wright . The occupation offered a major critique of the education system at the time. After the authorities regained control he was dismissed. He was at the Transnational Institute, Amsterdam from 1972‚Äì76, and then worked as a journalist and TV researcher (mainly for Channel 4 and Scottish Television, Glasgow) before a year at the Central European University with Ernest Gellner (1994‚Äì95) and then setting up and running a Masters course on Nationalism at University of Edinburgh (1995-1999). In 2001 he was invited to take up an Innovation Professorship in Nationalism and Cultural Diversity at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Australia, leaving in January 2010. Returning to the UK he was fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study of Durham University (2009). Outline of his arguments He is considered one of the key thinkers of the British New Left. From 1962, with Perry Anderson in New Left Review, he developed a thesis (the \\"Nairn-Anderson thesis\\") to explain why Britain did not develop in a 'normal' way, which was defined as the continental European movement to anti-clericalism and Republicanism since the 1789 French Revolution. Nairn has long been an advocate of European integration, an argument he put forward in The Left Against Europe (1973), when leftist opinion in the UK was very much against the idea. He has been an advocate of the devolution of power to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, and criticised the 1990s‚Äì2000s Blair Labour government for not giving those bodies enough power. Nairn considered that Scotland‚Äôs economic potential had been limited by the concentration of power in London in combination with the archaic nature of the British state. An anthology of NLR articles, The Break-Up of Britain (1977, revised 1982) is the best known of Nairn's books on the nationalism theme. It is a Marxist critique of the emergence of worldwide nationalism. Essentially, Nairn contends that imperialism from the core countries (Western Europe) amongst the peripheral nations (Africa, Asia, Australia, etc.) motivated the peripheral elites to mobilize their exploited masses. As such, they created powerful myths and stories based on local artefacts and local happenings. The peripheral intelligentsia, as he denotes them, were inspired by both romanticism and populism. In a chapter devoted to him, Enoch Powell is placed in both traditions. His republican inclinations meant that his The Enchanted Glass (1988) was one of the earliest serious modern investigations into the British monarchy from an abolitionist perspective. It won the Saltire Society Scottish Book of the Year Award. Here and elsewhere Nairn uses the term 'Ukania' to suggest the irrational and Ruritanian nature of the British constitutional monarchy. His original source for the term is the nickname \\"Kakania\\" that Robert Musil uses for the dual Austro-Hungarian monarchy in The Man Without Qualities. An updated edition of The Enchanted Glass (published by Verso) appeared in 2011. Honours In 2009 he was elected a fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia.

He made 57 Test, and 639 first-class cricket appearances in total, taking 1,473 catches. The 2,069 victims across his entire career is the most of any wicket-keeper in first-class history. He is considered as one of the world's most accomplished wicket-keepers. He made his first-class debut for Minor Counties against South Africa in 1960, having made his Staffordshire debut in 1958. He became Derbyshire's first choice wicket- keeper when George Dawkes sustained a career-ending injury. His final First Class appearance was at the Scarborough Festival in 1988. He remained first choice until his retirement except for a short period in 1964 when Laurie Johnson was tried as a batsman-wicketkeeper. Taylor made his Test debut in 1971 in New Zealand at the end of the successful Ashes winning tour. Though highly regarded, Taylor was unable to displace incumbent Alan Knott, a talented keeper and a superior batsman. It was only when Knott joined World Series Cricket in 1977 that Taylor appeared in more Tests and was selected as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1977. He continued to be England's choice keeper through the 1970s, falling three short of a maiden Test century in the 1978-79 Ashes, and retiring from Tests in 1984 ‚Äì though he would make an emergency appearance for a day of Test cricket in 1986 ‚Äì and all first- class cricket in 1988. Early life Taylor was born in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. He began cricketing early, keeping wicket in a car park next to Stoke City Football Club's home ground, before playing for his schools Under-15 XI aged 12. He also was on the books of Port Vale F.C. as an apprentice, though he never played football professionally. At 15 years he played for Bignall End Cricket Club in the North Staffs and South Cheshire League and for Staffordshire in the Minor Counties cricket league. On his debut he was confused for a spectator because of his youth. He continued playing for Staffordshire from 1958 to 1960, whereupon he moved to Derbyshire and joined the Second XI of Derbyshire County Cricket Club. Career =County stalwart= Taylor played in 639 first-class matches. His 1,649 dismissals (1,473 caught, 176 stumped) in 639 games remains a first-class record. With the bat, Taylor averaged only 16.92, and he is one of only two players to have passed 10,000 first-class runs without scoring a century though he subsequently scored exactly 100 against Yorkshire at Sheffield in 1981, his only first-class century. He also took one first-class wicket as a bowler. He played his debut first-class match against South Africa on 1 June 1960, appearing as keeper for a Minor Counties XI. He scored 11 and a duck and did not take any catches behind the stumps. Thanks largely to recommendations by Cliff Gladwin, he went on to make his County Championship and Derbyshire debut on 7 June the follow year, scoring another duck and eight as well as taking two catches as Derbyshire drew with Sussex at the County Ground, Derby. His first victim was Sussex's Ken Suttle, yet several players observed that he had much to learn; many bowlers condemned him for standing up to the stumps and missing edges. Taylor would go on to play 17 matches in his debut 1961 season for his county, scoring 20 runs at 11.38 with a best of 48, taking 47 catches and 6 stumpings behind the wicket. 29 more games followed in 1960, however his batting remained unimpressive, scoring 300 runs at 10.71 with a best of 44. He remained dependable behind the stumps, with 77 catches and three stumpings. His 77 catches set a new Derbyshire-record. He notched his first half-century in the 1963 season, though averaged under 10.00. His 32 first-class games that season, what would be a career high, and a career-best season total of 81 catches behind the timbers. This included all ten wickets in a match against Hampshire falling courtesy of his glove-work. The 1964 season was marked for Taylor's mid-season ankle injury. Though it occurred when he was playing football, he told his county that he had slipped on an escalator. According to Wisden the experience taught Taylor to be fastidious in his attention to physical fitness. He nevertheless scored his second half- century and took 58 catches. Nevertheless, Derbyshire considered dropping Taylor for Laurie Johnson, a more capable batsman. An effort with the pen from several Wisden contributors secured his reinstatement, however. Taylor's strong keeping continued to secure his place in the side, though despite a career best 719 runs in the 1966 season his batting struggled, with no half- centuries to add to his tally. In 1967 his career was again put on hiatus through injury, when he edged a delivery into his own eye and suffered a detached retina which put him on his back for three weeks. He nevertheless took another 63 catches from 23 appearances, but managed only 442 runs at 18.41. His batting in the County Championship saw marginal improvement over the next two seasons, with a half century in 1968 and a career best 65 in 1969. The 1969 season also saw Taylor make his first major forays into List-A cricket. He made 19 appearances that year, having made only seven others over the previous six. He only scored 180 runs, however he took 28 catches behind the stumps which would be a season best for the rest of his career. Over the winter of 1969, he was selected to tour Sri Lanka with the Marylebone Cricket Club. He played one match, on 20 February 1970, against Ceylon at Colombo. He scored 7 and 19*, and stumped Anura Tennekoon as the MCC moved to a convincing victory. Taylor returned to England for the 1970 county season, continuing his good form behind the stumps with 21 List-A and 51 Championship catches. He also snared 11 stumping victims, a career best. He toured with the MCC over the winter in Australia, with 16 more victims from four matches though his batting disappointed, with 94 runs at only 18.80. =New Zealand Test debut= With his experience with the MCC, and his county success behind the stumps, Taylor had been coming to the notice of England captain Ray Illingworth. Though Knott was incumbent, Illingworth rewarded Taylor's patience with a Test cap. Taylor made his Test debut against New Zealand at Christchurch on 25 February 1971. In an eight-wicket England victory, he took two catches and a stumping, but scored only four runs before being stumped by his opposite number. His quiet debut escaped any reference in Wisdens match report. He did not play another match on the tour, and would not play another Test for six more years. =County interim= Taylor instead returned to England for the 1971 season, improving with the bat and scoring 619 runs at 24.76, with three half-centuries and a best of 74*. He secured another 68 victims from behind the stumps across all matches. Over the winter of 1971/72, he was selected for the World Test XI tour of Australia, playing seven four-day matches under captain Rohan Kanhai. He took 21 catches, performed three stumpings and although he only scored 128 runs at 16.00 this including a half century against Western Australia on 4 December. He returned to England for the summer of 1972, scoring another half century and snaring fifty batsmen from behind the stumps in the County Championship, and a further 23 in the one day arena. A further 77 batsmen fell to Taylor in 1973, and he earned a place on the MCC winter tour of the West Indies. Although not being selected for the Test series over the incumbent Knott, he scored 65 against Jamaica on 9 February, outscoring Knott's five. In doing so, he passed 6,500 first-class runs in his career. Taylor became a regular back-up keeper for Knott on England's winter tours. After a solid 1974 season with another County Championship half century and 86 victims with the gloves, he toured New Zealand with the England national side, and following 111 more wickets in 1975 toured South Africa with the International Wanderers under Greg Chappell. On facing a South African Invitation XI in Johannesburg on 2 April Taylor, batting in the second innings, scored a career best 97 before being dismissed by Howard Bergins. Over 1976 and 1977, he took 164 more dismissals, and scored 910 runs including another half-century. He was selected as Wisden Cricketer of the Year for 1977, along with Mike Brearley, Gordon Greenidge, Michael Holding and Viv Richards. =Return to Tests= Knott, the incumbent keeper for England, turned to World Series Cricket in 1977 on the encouragement of Tony Greig and was thus banned from Test cricket. Taylor was the next in line to take up the gloves, and returned to Test cricket on 14 December 1977 against Pakistan at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. Although there had been three first-class warm- up fixtures, Taylor had not impressed with the bat and had been rotated out of the second game in order for Paul Downton to have a chance at the gloves. Taylor nevertheless got the nod for the first Test. Captained by fellow Wisden Cricketers of the Year Brearley, he took two catches and a stumping, and score a lengthy 32 from 158 deliveries supporting Geoff Miller who was eventually stranded on 98. He played in the following two Tests of the series, and though keeping tidily he was dismissed for a first ball duck ‚Äì a score of zero ‚Äì in the second Test, though improved with a slow (and then career best) 36 from 200 balls and 18 not out in the third match. He also played in the 2nd and 3rd One Day International fixtures. He remained the incumbent gloveman for the New Zealand leg of the tour, appearing in two warm up games and three Tests. He took four catches in the first, all from the bowling of Chris Old, and scored a career-best 45 in the second. His 236 runs across the entire tour came at 21.45, and he took 20 catches and a stumping. Taylor returned to the County Championship for three matches before the home Pakistan Test series. Taylor played in all three Tests, keeping well with eight catches but batting poorly, with 12 runs at only 6.00. Although he took five catches and three stumpings in the ODI series, he batted only once and did not score. He only had two more County Championship appearances before the home Test series against New Zealand on 27 July, where despite 12 catches and a stumping he again averaged low with the bat ‚Äì 31 runs at 10.33. Nevertheless, he retained his place in the team. =1978/79 Ashes series= The Adelaide Oval, scene of Taylor's career-best 97. Taylor joined the England team for the winter Ashes series of 1978/79, commencing the tour by facing South Australia on 3 November 1978. Though it was a quiet game with the bat, Taylor was in strong form behind the stumps ‚Äì collecting eight victims though the tourists went on to lose the match. Facing New South Wales on 17 November, Taylor hit a forgettable nine, however four more scalps came, two of them from what was becoming a prolific partnership, both for England and Derbyshire, with Geoff Miller. England went into the first Test on 1 December with mixed success in the warm up matches behind them. Australia batted first, however with wickets for Bob Willis, Old and Ian Botham, and five catches for Taylor, they were removed for only 116. Taylor, batting at number four, scored 20 runs as England replied with 286; however, the tourists' bowling success would not strike twice as Australia reached 339 in the second innings and Taylor was quiet behind the stumps during that innings. England reached the required total with 170/3 and thus won by seven wickets. England, however, took a 166 run victory in the second Test, commencing on 15 December at the WACA. Taylor made only 14 runs, but he held onto six catches for England's potent bowling attack. Australia replied with a 103-run victory in the third Test, and Taylor was quiet both with the gloves and the bat. The fourth Test was equally unspectacular for Taylor, though England took a series-lead with a 93-run victory. On 27 January 1979, Geoffrey Boycott and Brearley walked out to bat at the Adelaide Oval for the fifth Test, having been put in by Australia. The tourists were routed for 169 all out with Taylor only making four runs. He partnered with Botham to take two catches as Australia were, in return, routed for 164. England, needing to set a commanding total, reached 267/7 when Taylor walked out to bat with his Derbyshire colleague Miller. Miller went on to make 64 before he was dismissed and John Emburey came to the crease, however, by the time Taylor was sent back England had reached 336/8, Taylor having scored 97 runs from 300 balls. He passed his previous Test best of 45, and with his 97th run he both equalled his first-class best and reached 9,500 first-class runs. His dismissal was to a \\"tiny leg-side tickle\\" though, despite being three from a hundred, he chose to walk off the field. John Thicknesse in 2004 wrote that \\"it said everything about his sportsmanship.\\" Though Taylor took no catches in the final innings, Willis and Mike Hendrick combined to reduce Australia to 160 all out and give England victory. Taylor made 36 in the final Test match, three catches and a stumping as England took a convincing nine-wicket victory to seal the series. Taylor's 208 runs at 26.00 outscored captain Brearley, and he ended the Test series with 18 catches and two stumpings. Taylor played a one-day warm up match against Tasmania, however his ODI place was taken by David Bairstow. =1979 World Cup= Taylor returned to England to make several Benson and Hedges Cup and John Player League List-A appearances, and resumed his capable keeping for Derbyshire in the County Championship ‚Äì in a match against Leicestershire on 2 May he took four catches and performed two stumpings. In June, the 1979 Cricket World Cup commenced in England, and Taylor was selected as keeper for the tournament which consisted of 60 overs per innings. England were seen as good prospects for the tournament, having won five of their previous six Tests thanks, according to Wisden, to \\"the bowlers, Bob Taylor's skilful wicket-keeping, and the all-round excellence of Ian Botham.\\" 9 June saw the opening match of Group A, where England faced Australia at Lord's. Taylor took one catch, but was not called on to bat as the hosts won by six wickets. Nor was he required to bat on 13 June when, in a two-day game where England demolished Canada for 45 all out and won by eight wickets. Against Pakistan on 16 June at Headingley he scored 20 from 59 balls and took two catches as England won by a narrower margin of 14 runs. England thus reached the semi-finals, and faced New Zealand at Old Trafford on 20 June. Taylor, batting at nine, scored 12 runs from 25 before he was run out, and New Zealand fell to 212 chasing 221. The final took place at Lord's on 23 June against the West Indies. The host team ‚Äì minus an injured Willis ‚Äì put the West Indies into bat, however a century from Viv Richards took them to 286/9 ‚Äì with Taylor taking one catch. Despite an opening partnership of 129 between Brearley and Boycott, England fell 92 runs short at 194 all out. Taylor, batting at ten, was dismissed for a first-ball duck from Joel Garner before Hendrick was bowled by Colin Croft to seal the West Indies' victory. Taylor's returns were modest, scoring only 32 runs at 16.00 with a best of 20*, and taking four catches but no stumpings. Taylor returned to Derbyshire, who had reached the Semi-Final of the Benson and Hedges Cup, however despite taking two catches and scoring eight runs, Surrey took a six-run victory and knocked Derbyshire out of the competition. On 12 July, Taylor was back with the England team for three Tests against India, where he proved himself more formidable with the bat ‚Äì with a knock of 64 inflating his average to 32.50. =Australia 1979/80, 1981= From August 1979 to November 1981, Taylor and England would play Australia in two Ashes series, with one other Test against India. Taylor acquitted himself well over the winter tour of Australia and India, scoring 145 runs from four matches at 20.71, and his polished glovework took 20 catches and performed one stumping. On 15 February 1980, during the only Test against India in Bombay to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Taylor took seven catches in India's first innings, and three more in the second, all but two off the bowling of Botham. England won convincingly by ten wickets. His ten wickets for the match set a new world Test record. Taylor's 43 runs with the bat set a partnership of 171 runs with Botham, also a record sixth-wicket partnership for England against India. This included Taylor begin dismissed leg before wicket only to protest the decision and have his reservations supported by the Indian captain Gundappa Viswanath. Taylor returned for the 1980 County Championship in England, and although he scored only 238 runs at 14.87 from 20 appearances he took 34 catches and performed seven stumpings, Derbyshire camp joint ninth that season. On 10 June 1981, the touring Australian side faced Derbyshire in Derby in a three-day drawn match. Taylor had as quiet game. remaining five not out and not taking part in any wickets. On 17 June, however, during a county Championship match against Yorkshire, Taylor hit the only century of his career. Having taken two catches and performed two stumpings in Yorkshire's first innings of 374, he helped Derbyshire reach 480 with an innings of exactly 100 before being caught and bowled by Phil Carrick. The match was drawn before the third innings could begin. Taylor again missed out on a place in the ODI team for the Prudential Trophy against Australia, with Geoff Humpage making the only three international appearances of his career. Paul Downton also took his place for the first Test of the 1981 Ashes series, where Australia took a four-wicket victory. Taylor was on the pitch for the 2nd Test, however, and despite scores of zero and nine took four catches as the match was drawn. In the third Test at Headingley, Taylor took seven catches though was outshone by Botham's all-round performance in England's 18-run victory. Two catches and eight runs came in England's 29 run win at Edgbaston on 30 July. Before the fifth Test, however, Knott ‚Äì having returned from the Packer series and been admitted back into the Test fold, was awarded Taylor's place for the final two Tests. Taylor, his 1981 Ashes series truncated, finished with only 23 runs at a dire 3.83 average ‚Äì the lowest of the entire England team including specialist bowlers. His keeping has netted him 13 catches, however. Knott, selected for his superior batting skills, scored 178 runs from his two Test matches at 59.33. Taylor instead returned to Derbyshire, and ended his season with 231 runs at 19.25, including his maiden century, 33 catches and 12 stumpings. =Final years= Taylor toured India and Sri Lanka over the winter of 1981/82, playing in seven Test matches. Though his keeping accounted for 19 batsmen, he scored only 88 runs over eight innings at 14.66. He kept for only two of the ODI matches, with Jack Richards taking the gloves from him for the rest. After a brief return to Derbyshire for the County Championship in May, he was again in the Test squad for the home series against India, taking nine catches but again a low 12.00 runs per innings from the three matches. Pakistan swiftly followed, and Taylor made 54 in England's second innings of the first Test at Edgbaston on 29 July, On 22 October he commenced his 1982/83 tour of Australia by passing 11,000 first- class runs in a match against Queensland, before keeping wicket for all five Tests. Though he scored only 135 runs at 19.28, he took another 13 catches. He again missed out on the one day position, however, this time to Ian Gould. Upon his return he played several matches for Derbyshire in the County Championship. His batting would continue to struggle, only 267 runs at 17.80, though he kept tidily with 37 catches and two stumpings through the season. Commencing in mid-July, he also took part in a four-Test home series against New Zealand, taking 11 catches but failing to make an impression with the bat ‚Äì 63 runs at 10.50. He returned to New Zealand that winter, and then on to Pakistan, though despite keeping well he failed to score more than 83 runs at 9.22. He featured in all three ODI matches, however, taking two catches but scoring only 10 runs at 5.00 per innings. His batting was consistently below par despite his keeping ability, and the third test against Pakistan on 19 March 1984 at Lahore was to be his last. It was a quiet game for him, scoring only one and five, and taking one catch in a drawn fixture. Taylor played a full stint in the 1984 County Championship, playing 18 matches and scoring 303 runs at 20.20, as well as taking 32 victims with the gloves. Derbyshire could only manage twelfth. Taylor fared well with the gloves in the one day tournaments also, taking 10 catches in the Benson and Hedges Cup, and eight more in the John Player Special League. On 8 September Taylor commenced his final four days playing for Derbyshire's First XI. On that day, his last County Championship match began against Hampshire. No play took place on the following day, 9 September, to allow the John Player Special League match between the two counties, where Taylor look two catches but was not called on to bat. Following this game, on 10 September, the County Championship resumed with Hampshire on 535/4, Taylor having taken one catch to remove Trevor Jesty from the bowling of Ole Mortensen. Derbyshire declared without losing another wicket, and Derbyshire reached 322/3 declared without Taylor having to bat thanks to centuries from Kim Barnett and Bill Fowler. Taylor completed a stumping from Miller to restrict Hampshire to 245/8, and Derbyshire chased down the final total for a five-wicket victory without Taylor needing to come out of the pavilion. He then retired. This would not be Taylor's last outing with the club, however. He captained Derbyshire Second XI in 1985 for eight games, though he did not keep wicket. Batting last in the order, he was rarely called on to bat. During New Zealand's 1986 Test match at Lord's, Taylor was present in the hospitality tent when Bruce French was injured by a Richard Hadlee delivery. After trialling Bill Athey behind the wicket, New Zealand captain Jeremy Coney permitted Taylor to come on the field to keep for the remainder of the day. Wisden recorded \\"[Taylor] equipped himself with an assortment of borrowed kit, although he did, far-sightedly, have his own gloves in his car... Despite having retired from first-class cricket two years earlier, Taylor ... kept without a blemish.\\" Bobby Parks was brought in to keep for the following day. Also in 1986, Taylor was selected as part of Brian Close's invitational XI to play New Zealand at Scarborough on 31 August. Taylor kept wicket, and scored 21 as well as taking two catches. He was part of Michael Parkinson's World XI in 1988, playing against the MCC where Taylor again kept wicket and scored four runs. Style and equipment Taylor's wicket keeping abilities have been oft praised. In his citation for Cricketer of the Year for 1977, Wisden noted that \\"artistry ‚Äì there is no other word for it ‚Äì behind the stumps has long illumined even the darkest hours of Derbyshire cricket.\\" He was known both for his acrobatic fielding behind the stumps, and his diligence and stamina, \\"he has been without peer in the world for some years and would clearly have graced the England team but for Alan Knott.\\" He was noted for standing up to the stumps on nearly all occasions, stating that \\"Any decent slip catcher could do it standing back.\\" By keeping his weight forwards and planted on his left foot, he was a skilled leg side stumper ‚Äì considered a difficult skill in wicket keeping.Andrew, p. 89. Taylor was careful with his fitness, following an ankle injury in 1964 kept him from the first seven games of the season. Taylor wore two pairs of thin Chamois inners and Mitre wicket-keeping gloves from which he cut away all the padding from inside the palms and removed the webbing. His reasoning for this was that he liked to feel the ball in his palm and if taking the ball correctly most of the time the bruising wasn't too troublesome. This can be contrasted with Knott who preferred plenty of padding on his palms.The Cricketer, 1988 Equipment supplement, p. 23. Taylor was a popular member of the England and Derbyshire squads, his nickname \\"Chat\\" deriving from his willingness to talk to his teammates and listen to their problems. Himself a mediocre batsmen but skilled keeper, Taylor has continued to advocate the picking of capable wicket-keepers over those with lesser ability behind the stumps but greater talent with the bat. He has been vocal over English selection policies since retirement, particularly those of Geraint Jones, Chris Read and Matt Prior.

He was a firm fixture on the professional tennis tour for over 60 years and is considered the foremost designer of tennis dresses of the 20th century. Early life Tinling was born in Eastbourne, on the south coast of England, the son of James Alexander Tinling, a chartered accountant. In 1923, suffering from bronchial asthma, his parents sent him to the French Riviera on doctor's orders. It was there he began playing tennis, particularly at the Nice Tennis Club where Suzanne Lenglen practiced. Despite Tinling's youth, Lenglen's father asked him if he would umpire one of her upcoming matches. He became her personal umpire for two years in between a short career as a player himself. This friendship with Lenglen led him to his first Wimbledon Championships in 1927, where he became player liaison until 1949. During the Second World War, he was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Intelligence Corps in Algiers and Germany.  Career as designer  A Tinling dress for Billie Jean King (1973) Tinling designed a wedding dress for the British two-time Wimbledon singles champion, Dorothy Round on the occasion of her marriage in 1937. He also designed dresses for almost all of the great female players throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. His dresses were worn by the Wimbledon ladies' champion throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The last Wimbledon champion to wear a Tinling creation was Martina Navratilova in 1979 when she wore his designs to triumph in both the singles and doubles events. In 1983, Billie Jean King wore a Tinling dress in a final for the last time, when she reached the Wimbledon Mixed Doubles final. The last Tinling dress worn at Wimbledon was by Rosemary Casals in 1984, when she lost in the first round. Although he only ever designed dresses for Chris Evert's Federation & Wightman Cup appearances, he designed her wedding dress when she married John Lloyd in 1979. A close friend of Billie Jean King ‚Äì designing her dress for the famous \\"Battle of the Sexes\\" tennis match in 1973 ‚Äì he became player liaison on the Virginia Slims Women's Tennis Association tour that King helped to create. He continued to design daring and unusual dresses for stars such as Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert, Evonne Goolagong and Virginia Wade throughout this time but his role in the infrastructure of tennis became more important and he became an official media spokesperson for the game.  1949 Wimbledon controversy  It was a design in 1949 that led to him being asked to take leave from his position at Wimbledon. That year he designed not only the dress for Gussie Moran, but also a pair of white underwear that were adorned with lace, creating a sensation, with photographers fighting for positions where they could get low-angle shots of Moran. This led to Wimbledon chairman Sir Louis Greig to become furious with Tinling for \\"having drawn attention to the sexual area\\". He was banned from the tournament for 33 years, only being invited back on the grounds of the All England Lawn Tennis Club in 1982, when he retook his position as player liaison. The incident created a media frenzy, drawing public attention to both Tinling and Moran. While the Wimbledon officials accused Moran of \\"putting sin and vulgarity into tennis\\", the media dubbed her \\"Gorgeous Gussie\\". According to Tinling himself, \\"the situation snowballed out of all proportion. Gussie was inundated with requests for personal appearances ‚Äì hospitals, garden fetes and beauty contests. The Marx Brothers, in London at the time, invited her to join their act. A racehorse, an aircraft and a restaurant's special sauce were named after her. She was voted the best dressed sports woman by the US Fashion Academy. The whole thing was staggering.\\"  Later life  Ted Tinling and Rod Humphries in 1979 In 1975, Tinling moved to Philadelphia. He remained a consultant to the women's tour even after he gave up design in his old age. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1986. He wrote several books on tennis in the 1980s, but respiratory problems continued to affect him and he died in 1990. After his death it was revealed he had been a British Intelligence spy during the Second World War.  Personal life  Tinling was openly gay. His brother, RAF officer James Collingwood Tinling, was a member of the team that built the first jet engine.  Portrayals  Tinling has been portrayed in two movies concerning the Battle of the Sexes tennis match played in 1973 between Bobby Riggs & Billie Jean King. In the 2001 TV Movie When Billie Beat Bobby, he was portrayed by American actor Gerry Becker and in the 2017 cinema release Battle of the Sexes, Tinling was played by British star Alan Cumming. Cumming played the role with a full head of hair, whereas Becker had played the part bald; accurately reflecting Tinling's appearance.

CDOs usually report to the chief executive officer (CEO), although depending on the area of expertise this can vary. The CDO is a member of the executive management team and manager of enterprise-wide data processing and data mining. Role definition The Chief Data Officer title shares its abbreviation with the Chief Digital Officer but the two are not the same job. The Chief Data Officer has a significant measure of business responsibility for determining what kinds of information the enterprise will choose to capture, retain and exploit and for what purposes.http://www.bigdataparis.com/presentation/mercredi/PDelort.pdf?PHPSESSID=tv7k70pcr3egpi2r6fi3qbjtj6#page=11 However, the similar-sounding Chief Digital Officer or Chief Digital Information Officer often does not bear that business responsibility, but rather is responsible for the information systems through which data is stored and processed. History and evolution The role of manager for data processing was not elevated to that of senior management prior to the 1980s. As organizations have recognized the importance of information technology as well as business intelligence, data integration, master data management and data processing to the fundamental functioning of everyday business, this role has become more visible and crucial. This role includes defining strategic priorities for the company in the area of data systems and opportunities, identifying new business opportunities pertaining to data, optimizing revenue generation through data, and generally representing data as a strategic business asset at the executive table. With the rise in service-oriented architectures (SOA), large-scale system integration, and heterogeneous data storage/exchange mechanisms (databases, XML, EDI, etc.), it is necessary to have a high-level individual, who possesses a combination of business knowledge, technical skills, and people skills, guide data strategy. Besides the revenue opportunities, acquisition strategy, and customer data policies, the chief data officer is charged with explaining the strategic value of data and its important role as a business asset and revenue driver to executives, employees, and customers. This contrasts with the older view of data systems as mere back-end IT systems. More recently, with the adoption of data science the Chief Data Officer is sometimes looked upon as the key strategy person either reporting to the Chief Strategy Officer or serving the role of CSO in lieu of one. This person has the responsibility of measurement along various business lines and consequently defining the strategy for the next growth opportunities, product offerings, markets to pursue, competitors to look at etc. This is seen in organizations like Chartis, AllState and Fidelity Early CDO appointments * Cathryne Clay Doss of Capital One was appointed chief data officer in 2002. *Manish Pandey, CDO of Oracle from 2020 * Usama Fayyad, Chief Data Officer and Senior Vice President of Yahoo! in 2005.

Education Following working in a teaching post in the Economics Department in the University of Indonesia, he undertook further studies in the Nederlandse Economische hogeschool (currently Erasmus University Rotterdam) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Career After a few years working in the Netherlands following his graduation he returned to Indonesia and held several executive positions and became an entrepreneur. He maintained a strong interest in politics and education, and said to the press that, \\"I now have enough money to pay for anything I can wish for,\\" and with that started his involvement with the PDI-P opposition political party of Megawati Sukarnoputri. He also founded Institut Bisnis & Informatika Indonesia (IBII) which is now known as Kwik Kian Gie School of Business, a well-known business/management school in Indonesia, with his colleagues. Candidacy During the rise of Megawati Sukarnoputri he was mentioned as a possible candidate for the important post of Coordinating Minister of Economics and Finance. He was appointed to the position by Abdurrahman Wahid in the Wahid Cabinet in October 1999. However, various political hurdles prevented him from making much progress during his term in office. He was later moved to the position of Minister of National Development and Planning. His period as minister was seen by some as a disappointment.

It was Glitter's first number-one single on the UK Singles Chart, spending four weeks at the top of the chart in July 1973. Description The song \\"I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)\\" was a top hit for Gary Glitter; the song reached number-one in the UK Singles Chart in July and August 1973. It was written by Gary Glitter and Mike Leander and produced by Mike Leander. As a result of its popularity, Glitter's nickname became \\"The Leader\\". The song is a glam rock anthem typical of Glitter's early 1970s output, based on a simple mid-tempo rhythm (the so-called \\"Glitter Stomp\\") and loud chanted backing vocals such as \\"Hey!\\" and \\"Come on, come on!\\". Glitter had a backing band, the Glitter Band, but with the exception of saxophonists Harvey Ellison and John Rossall, they did not participate in his recording sessions, and precisely who else, if anyone, helped Glitter and producer/co-writer Mike Leander in the studio remains unknown. Glitter said in interviews that he and Leander preferred to play everything themselves, since it allowed them to record the songs as they were being written. The song became a concert favourite with the crowd chanting the \\"Come on, come on!\\" refrain before Glitter took to the stage. Although Glitter's version failed to chart in the U.S., the following year a version by Brownsville Station made the Top 30 on the Cashbox Top 100 and reached No. 48 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 1986, still a popular live act, Glitter re-recorded the song with Girlschool. This version missed the UK charts but reached No.8 on the indie chart Show Heavy Metal charts. In 1997, girl group Spice Girls covered the song for their musical comedy film Spice World. Glitter originally made a cameo appearance in the film, but his scene was deleted after he was arrested for possession of child pornography.The Truth Behind The Deleted Gary Glitter Cameo In The Spice Girls Movie The song was used in the 1997 movie The Full Monty where it is credited in the trailer section.

Gladkov joined a Communist group in 1904, and in 1905 went to Tiflis (now Tbilisi) and was arrested there for revolutionary activities. He was sentenced to three years' exile. He then moved to Novorossiisk. Among other positions, he served as the editor of the newspaper Krasnoye Chernomorye, secretary of the journal Novy Mir, special correspondent for Izvestiya, and director of the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow from 1945 to 1948. He received the Stalin Prize (in 1949) for his literary accomplishments, and is considered a classic writer of Soviet Socialist Realist literature. Teacher, exile and revolutionary Gladkov was born in 1883 in Bolshaya Chernavka, Saratov Governorate (present-day Penza Oblast) to a family of Old Believers. In 1904, Gladkov began propaganda work for the Social Revolutionary party in Chita, Irkutsk, joining the teachers' institute of Tiflis in the following year. In 1906 he began propaganda work for the Bolsheviks, and was exiled that November for four years to Manzurka village in Irkust province. After completing his exile, Gladkov returned to Novorssiisk and to the Kuban where he was appointed the head of a primary school in Pavlovskaya. In the spring of 1918 he returned to Novorssiisk to reorganise schools after the revolution in October 1917, though was forced into hiding when the Whites (pro-monarchist forces) captured the village in August of that year. In 1920, by which time the Whites had been driven out, Gladkov was appointed as the head of education in the town. He would also serve in the Red Army, before being made editor of the newspaper Krasnoye chernomorye. In 1921 he moved to Moscow where he was appointed as the head of a factory school, then secretary of the journal Novy mir (New World). Gladkov was a member of The Smithy writers group, who were engaged in polemics with the Association of Proletarian Writers (RAPP). While a proponent of portraying the revolution in literature, he was anxious about the tone in which groups such as RAPP and MAPP (Moscow Association of Proletarian Writers) conducted their discussions, and the \\"working over\\" that non-RAPP writers were given in particular journals. In 1941 he became a special correspondent for the newspaper Izvestiya, reporting from Sverdlovsk, specialising in war-time industrial topics. After the war, he was director of the Gorky Literary Institute in Moscow. He died in Moscow in 1958. Cement (1925) Gladkov's Cement was published in a multitude of editions, including this 1928 Finnish translation from Astoria, Oregon, USA. Gladkov's first major novel after the revolution, titled Cement, became a literary standard for socialist realist writing during the 1930s; in various speeches to the Writers' Congress in the USSR, Gladkov's contemporaries upheld Cement as one of the key exemplars that authors should emulate in Soviet literature.Katerina Clark, The Soviet novel: history as ritual, The University of Chicago Press (1981), pp. 261-262 Throughout his lifetime, Gladkov rewrote passages of Cement both to suit contemporary political concerns and to fit with the Socialist Realist aesthetic established in 1932.Robert L.

The range was named on 12 June 1861 by explorer Francis Thomas Gregory after Edward Hamersley, a prominent promoter of his exploration expedition to the northwest. Juukan Gorge lies within the ranges, about from the mining town of Tom Price, as does Karijini National Park. History The traditional Aboriginal owners of the area that the range runs through are the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura peoples. In 1999 a small range within the Hamersley was named the Hancock Range after the Hancock family, who were pioneers in the area. The Hancock range is east of Karijini National Park in a region of broad valleys and peaks that rise to almost . The Hancock Range is close to Mulga Downs Station, a property owned by the Hancock family and where Lang Hancock is buried. Geography The range runs from the Fortescue River in the northeast, to the south. The range contains Western Australia's highest point, Mount Meharry, which reaches approximately AHD. There are many extensively eroded gorges, such as Wittenoom Gorge. The twenty highest peaks in Western Australia are in the Hamersley Range. Peaks in the range include Mount Bruce (), Mount Nameless/Jarndunmunha (), Mount Reeder Nichols (), Mount Samson (), Mount Truchanas () and Mount Tom Price (). Karijini National Park (formerly Hamersley National Park), one of Australia's largest national parks, is centred in the range. Paraburdoo and the Hamersley Range from the air Juukan Gorge A cave in Juukan Gorge, about from Mt Tom Price, was one of the oldest in the western Pilbara region, and the only inland site in Australia to show signs of continuous human occupation through the Ice Age. Mining company Rio Tinto received ministerial consent to damage the site in 2013 in the pursuit of expanding their iron ore mining operations, but a year later, an archaeological dig discovered the site was more than twice as old as previously thought and rich in cultural artefacts, including sacred objects. One particularly significant finding was a length of plaited human hair, woven together from strands from the heads of several different people, about 4,000 years old. DNA testing revealed that the hair had belonged to the direct ancestors of Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people alive today. PKKP heritage manager Heather Builth told Rio Tinto that the site was one of the \\"top five\\" most significant in the whole of the Pilbara region, and archaeologist Michael Slack told them that one of the rock shelters, Juukan 2, was of \\"the highest archaeological significance in Australia\\", saying that its significance \\"could not be overstated\\", being \\"[the only] site of this age with faunal remains in unequivocal association with stone tools\\". The cave was ultimately blasted along with another Aboriginal sacred site on 23 May 2020 as part of their expansion of the Brockman 4 mine, despite the PKKP having said many times that they wanted to preserve the site, and issuing an urgent request to halt the blasts five days beforehand. The Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 (WA) does not allow for mining consent to be renegotiated on the basis of new information, and the blasting was legal under a Section 18 exemption in the Act. WA Aboriginal Affairs Minister Ben Wyatt was as of August 2020 reviewing the Act. After this aroused widespread international media coverage and public outcry, Rio Tinto apologised to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and the Pinikura peoples for the destruction of the caves and for causing distress. The CEO of the iron ore group apologised on behalf of the company on 17 June. The National Native Title Council (NNTC) issued a request to the federal government asking for national legislation for Indigenous cultural heritage. The \\"Inquiry into the destruction of 46,000-year-old caves at the Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia\\" was referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia on 11 June 2020, to report by 20 September 2020. Rio Tinto appeared before the inquiry in August and admitted that it did not advise the traditional owners of other options besides blasting. Senior executives did not learn of the significance of the site until 21 May. The chair, Liberal MP Warren Entsch, requested permission from WA Premier Mark McGowan for a small group of politicians and staff to travel to the region in order to have face- to-face hearings with traditional owners early in September. Hansard will ensure accurate reporting of the meetings, and extra precautions are necessary because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. A Rio Tinto board internal review under Michael L‚ÄôEstrange, an independent non-executive director of Rio Tinto and former Australian high commissioner to the UK, ascribed the mistake to a series of flaws in their systems, sharing of information, engaging with the Indigenous people and decision-making, and promised to implement new measures, including \\"the need for a greater prioritisation of partnerships and relationships with Traditional Owners and First Nations people from senior operational leaders and teams\\". CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques would be losing in bonuses. They had missed many opportunities to halt the plan. The board review was published on their website on 24 August 2020. On 11 September 2020, it was announced that, as a result of the destruction at Juukan Gorge, CEO Jean- Sebastien Jacques and two other Rio Tinto executives would step down. The National Native Title Council (NNTC) welcomed the move, but said that there should be an independent review into the company's procedures and culture to ensure that such an incident could never happen again. Rio Tinto admitted their error, issued an apology via media and on their website, and also committed to building relationships with the traditional owners as well as getting Indigenous people into leadership roles in the company. One analysis of what went wrong in Rio Tinto to allow the destruction to occur suggested that processes failed at several levels, but mainly due to its \\"segmented organisational structure\\", a poor reporting structure, and Indigenous relations not being properly represented at a high enough level. Mining The range contains large deposits of iron ore, producing a large proportion of Australia's iron ore exports. It is predominately associated with banded iron formation.MacLeod, W. N.

Bulletin (Geological Survey of Western Australia), No. 117 Western Australia's major iron producers have mines, communities and railways that occur along the range.Iron fact sheet - Australian Resources and Deposits Geoscience Australia website, accessed: 7 November 2010 Rio Tinto operates several iron ore mines within the range, including Mount Tom Price, Marandoo, Brockman, Channar, West Angelas, Mesa A mine, and Paraburdoo. Over 100 million tonnes of iron ore is removed from the range every year.

It stars Swedish-born actress Greta Garbo and John Gilbert in their fourth and last film together. The film portrays the life of Queen Christina of Sweden, who became monarch at the age of six in 1632 and grew to be a powerful and influential leader. As well as coping with the demands of being a war-leader during the Thirty Years' War, Queen Christina is expected to marry a suitable royal figure and produce an heir. However, she falls in love with a visiting Spanish envoy whom she is forbidden to marry because he is a Roman Catholic; she must choose between love and her royal duty. The film was a major commercial and critical success in the United States and worldwide. Plot Queen Christina of Sweden (Greta Garbo) is very devoted to her country and the welfare of her people. As queen, Christina favors peace for Sweden. She argues convincingly for an end to the Thirty Years' War, saying: > Spoils, glory, flags and trumpets! What is behind these high-sounding words? > Death and destruction, triumphals of crippled men, Sweden victorious in a > ravaged Europe, an island in a dead sea. I tell you, I want no more of it. I > want for my people security and happiness. I want to cultivate the arts of > peace, the arts of life. I want peace and peace I will have! Christina, who first took the throne at age six upon the death of her father in battle, is depicted as so devoted to both governing well and educating herself that she has spurned any kind of serious romance or marriage despite pressures from her councilors and court to marry her heroic cousin Karl Gustav (Reginald Owen) and produce an heir. One day, in an effort to escape the restrictions of her royal life, she sneaks out of town, disguised as a man, and ends up snowbound at an inn, where she has to share a bed with the similarly stranded Spanish envoy, Antonio (John Gilbert), who is on his way to the capital. They become friends; in the bedroom, she reveals that she is a woman. They share the same bed as lovers; however, she still has not revealed that she is the queen. After a few idyllic nights together, Christina and Antonio are compelled to part, but Christina promises to find him in Stockholm. She does: When the Spaniard presents his embassy to the Queen, he recognizes her as his lover. Antonio is angry, because he has come to present an offer of marriage from the King of Spain to Queen Christina, and he feels that his loyalty to the king has been compromised. She makes it clear that she will not accept the king's proposal, and Christina and Antonio patch up their differences. When Count Magnus (Ian Keith), who wants the Queen's affections for his own, rouses the people against the Spaniard, Christina abdicates the throne, naming her cousin Karl Gustav as her successor while refusing to marry him. She leaves Sweden to catch up with Don Antonio, who has just left for a neighboring country, but she finds him gravely wounded from a sword duel with Magnus, which he lost. Antonio dies in her arms. She resolves to proceed with her voyage to Spain, where she envisions residing in Antonio's home on the white cliffs overlooking the sea. Production The film was released in December 1933. It was directed by Rouben Mamoulian and written by H. M. Harwood and Salka Viertel, with dialogue by S. N. Behrman, based on a story by Salka Viertel and Margaret P. Levino. Leading roles are played by Greta Garbo and John Gilbert, in his penultimate film. Gilbert died in January 1936 from heart attacks exacerbated by alcoholism. He had been a huge star in the silent era, but the enmity of studio head Louis B Mayer cast a pall over his career. Garbo herself insisted on Gilbert as her co-star. It was the fourth and last time that they were in a film together. Queen Christina was billed as Garbo's return to cinema after an eighteen-month hiatus. Prior to the shooting, while on holiday in Sweden, the actress read a treatment by Salka Viertel about the life of Christina and became interested in the story. At the time of shooting the film, Garbo was 28, the same age as her character. Queen Christina is a historical costume drama, loosely based on the life of 17th-century Queen Christina of Sweden and still more loosely on Strindberg's history play Kristina. A number of historical characters appear in the film, including Charles X Gustav of Sweden and Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie. Some historical events, such as the Thirty Years' War, are represented in the work, although Queen Christina is not a film that adheres closely to the facts. In this highly fictionalized account, it is falling in love that brings Christina into conflict with the political realities of her society. In real life, Christina's main reason for abdication was her determination not to marry, to live as she pleased and to openly convert to Catholicism. The romance with Antonio is fiction. In real life, Christina was devoted to her maid of honor, friend and ‚Äúbedfellow‚Äù, Ebba Sparre. Ebba does appear in the film. Christina kisses her twice, chastely, and any suggestion of a mutual relationship is firmly blocked by a scene in which Christina comes upon Ebba and Count Jakob meeting on a staircase. Christina immediately leaves for what will be her encounter with Antonio, When Christina returns, she apologizes to Ebba and promises she may marry her beloved Count. The real Ebba did marry Count Jakob, but the marriage was unhappy. The film is correct in stating that Christina's father had her raised as if she were a boy, with the education and responsibilities expected of a male heir. Her habit of dressing as a man continued throughout her life: \\"I shall die a bachelor!\\" she declares in the picture, wears men's clothes and disguises herself as a man. She was indeed adamant about making peace, and was a patron of science, art and culture, dreaming of making Stockholm the \\"Athens of the North\\". The film is remembered for two iconic scenes. The first one, more than three minutes long, shows Christina walking around the room, having spent two nights with Antonio at the inn. She examines and caresses various objects to imprint the space on her memory. The second one, arguably the most famous image in the film, is the closing shot, showing Christina standing as a silent figurehead at the bow of the ship bound for Spain. With the wind blowing through her hair, the camera moves into a tight close-up on her face. Prior to shooting the final scene, Mamoulian suggested that Garbo should think about nothing and avoid blinking her eyes, so that her face could be a \\"blank sheet of paper\\" and every member of the audience could write the ending of the film themselves. Amusingly, this shot also contains one of the greatest continuity errors in movie history: The wind blowing Garbo's hair is moving in the opposite direction from the wind filling the ship's sails.

Queen Christina turned out to be a success with the critics, gathering many positive reviews. Critic Mordaunt Hall, writing for The New York Times, gave the film a positive review and liked the screenplay, calling the dialogue \\"a bright and smooth piece of writing\\" and referred to Mamoulian's direction as \\"entrancing\\". Positive opinions came also from Modern Screen's Walter Ramsey, who proclaimed it a \\"triumph for Garbo\\", and a reviewer for Photoplay, who acclaimed Garbo's \\"glorious reappearance\\". Motion Picture Daily called the film \\"creaky in spots\\" but reported that Garbo \\"does beautifully\\" and that the film was \\"well above the average in content and value.\\" The New York Daily News wrote, \\"The picture moves a little slowly, but with grace, from one lovely setting to another. It is a picture that must not be missed, because Garbo is at her best in some of its scenes.\\" Some reviews were more mixed. \\"Garbo overwhelms the picture\\", wrote John Mosher in The New Yorker. \\"The story, the setting, her support cannot live up to her.\\" Variety found the film \\"slow and ofttimes stilted\\", though it wrote that Garbo's \\"regal impression is convincing, which counts for plenty.\\" The Sun of New York wrote that \\"Garbo seems to be suffering from an acute case of glamour. And that is probably not her fault. Gilbert tried very hard, but his performance is a little stilted. Queen Christina misses fire, somehow, and that is disappointing.\\" According to the AFI Catalog and to TCM's Frank Miller, despite the critical acclaim, the film did not do well at the American box office, grossIng $632,000 on an investment of $1.4 million. ‚ÄúIt would be years before foreign revenues and reissues brought the film into the profit column.‚Äù According to Barry Paris, writing in 1994, that final tally was: ‚ÄúCost: $1,144,000. Earnings: domestic $767,000; foreign $1,843,000; total $2,610,000. Profit: $632,000‚Äú . It was nominated for the Mussolini Cup award at the Venice Film Festival in 1934, but lost to Man of Aran. The part of Queen Christina is regarded as one of the best in Garbo's filmography. The film is especially notable for its resoundingly disproving rumours that John Gilbert's lack of success in the sound era was due to an unsuitable voice.Leonard Maltin, commentary. Dawn of Sound: How Movies Learned to Talk (documentary). Warner Bros. Entertainment, 2007. DVD. Leonard Maltin gives the film 4 out of 4 stars: ‚ÄúProbably Garbo's best film, with a haunting performance by the radiant star as 17th-century Swedish queen who relinquishes her throne for her lover, Gilbert. Garbo and Gilbert's love scenes together are truly memorable, as is the famous final shot...‚Äù As of June 2020, Queen Christina has a 90% \\"Fresh\\" rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 21 reviews. Historical accuracy One of the most educated women of the 17th century and the guest of five consecutive popes in Rome, Queen Christina abdicated her throne and converted to Roman Catholicism. She is one of few women buried in the Vatican grotto. The Spanish connection in the film makes little sense except as a typical \\"Hollywood\\" distortion of history‚Äîunless it is understood as an allegory, with her love for Don Antonio representing her love of the intellectual life and her embrace of the Catholic faith.

Background facts Following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, American public opinion initially stood by the large population of Japanese Americans living on the West Coast, or at least did not openly question their loyalty to the United States. Six weeks later, however, public opinion turned against Japanese Americans, as the press and other Americans became nervous about the potential for fifth column activity. Though the administration (including President Roosevelt and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover) dismissed rumors of Japanese American espionage on behalf of the Japanese war effort, pressure mounted upon the administration as the tide of public opinion turned against Japanese Americans. On February 19, 1942, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing Lieutenant General John DeWitt (as head of the Western Defense Command) to exclude certain persons from \\"military areas\\", regardless of their ancestry or country of citizenship. Over the course of several weeks, LTG DeWitt issued several public proclamations, which first imposed a curfew upon Japanese American citizens and resident \\"aliens\\" of Japanese descent. (The Issei, or first-generation immigrants, were prohibited from naturalized citizenship as members of an \\"unassimilable\\" race.) Later orders confined Japanese Americans to Military Area No. 1, which included Seattle, where Hirabayashi lived. On May 3, 1942, DeWitt issued an order requiring Japanese Americans in the Seattle area to report to assigned assembly points for \\"evacuation\\" to isolated inland camps. (At the time, the terms \\"relocation centers\\", \\"internment camps\\", and \\"concentration camps\\" were used interchangeably.) The case The defendant, Gordon Hirabayashi, was a University of Washington student who was accused of violating the curfew and exclusion order, designated a misdemeanor by Public Law 503, a Congressional statute introduced to enforce Executive Order 9066 and any subsequent military orders. Hirabayashi turned himself in for disobeying the curfew at the FBI's Seattle office on May 16, 1942, announcing that he also planned to disobey the impending removal order. He was held in King County Jail for five months, until his trial on October 20. The jury deliberated for just ten minutes before returning two guilty verdicts, one for the curfew violation and another for the exclusion order, and Hirabayashi was sentenced to consecutive thirty- day jail terms. (After requesting to serve his time in an outdoor labor camp rather than prison, Judge Lloyd Black handed down two ninety-day sentences, to be served concurrently at the Catalina Federal Honor Camp outside Tucson, Arizona.) Hirabayashi's lawyers appealed the conviction and, after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco declined to rule on the case, it eventually landed in the Supreme Court. The Justice Department expected a legal challenge to all of the three substantive elements of Roosevelt's and DeWitt's directives to Japanese Americans: curfew, exclusion, and internment. The FDR administration, and particularly the Department of Justice and Francis Biddle sought out test cases it could use to establish favorable precedent and prepare itself for a case that could challenge the entire internment policy. The Supreme Court heard both the Hirabayashi case and Yasui v. United States during the 1942‚Äì43 term, and released the opinions as companion cases on June 21, 1943. The Court upheld the curfew order in both the Hirabayashi and Yasui cases. (Although Hirabayashi had been convicted of two violations, because the two sentences had been served concurrently the Justices chose only to consider the curfew and not the more controversial exclusion of Japanese American citizens.) Minoru Yasui was \\"released\\" to the Minidoka concentration camp on time served, while Hirabayashi, who had been living in Spokane, Washington since finishing his sentence at Catalina, briefly remained free before being sent to the McNeil Island Federal Penitentiary when he refused to comply with a draft order. Later developments This case has been largely overshadowed by Korematsu v. United States,. decided the following term, in which the Court directly addressed the constitutionality of the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. But, though the Korematsu case (challenging the exclusion portion of Executive Order 9066) overshadowed the Hirabayashi case (challenging only the curfew portion of the order), the Court's opinion in Korematsu cited its Hirabayashi ruling, upholding the restrictions placed on Japanese Americans. The Hirabayashi case is notable also in that the three dissenters in Korematsu, Justices Roberts, Jackson, and Murphy had either been persuaded by fellow justices to vote with the majority or, in the case of Murphy, to concur. An article by historian Sidney Fine published in Pacific Historical Review in May 1964, \\"Mr. Justice Murphy and the Hirabayashi Case\\", pp. 195-209, shows how that Justice's initial draft opinion was a vigorous dissent, but that he eventually yielded to the arguments of his fellow Justices and issued a concurrence -- which, in Fine's view, \\"bore a striking resemblance to the dissenting opinion he had intended to issue.\\" In the Korematsu decision, Murphy's dissent was vehement, calling the majority opinion \\"legalization of racism.\\" In 1986 and 1987, Hirabayashi's convictions on both charges were overturned by the U.S. District Court in Seattle and the Federal Appeals Court, because evidence arose that the Solicitor General's office (led by Charles H. Fahy) had cited examples of Japanese American sabotage in its 1943‚Äì44 Supreme Court arguments, despite having researched and debunked all the rumored incidents. In 2011, the Acting Solicitor General officially confessed error in that regard. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued the final decision as Hirabayashi v. United States in 1987. In May 2012, President Obama awarded Gordon Hirabayashi posthumously the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honor. Eleven lawyers who had represented Fred Korematsu, Gordon Hirabayashi, and Minoru Yasui in successful efforts in lower federal courts to nullify their convictions for violating military curfew and exclusion orders sent a letter, dated January 13, 2014, to Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr.. In light of the appeal proceedings before the U.S. Supreme in Hedges v. Obama, the lawyers asked Verrili to request the Supreme Court to overrule its 1943 decisions in Korematsu, Hirabayashi and Yasui. If the Solicitor General shouldn't do this, they asked that the United States government \\"make clear\\" that the federal government \\"does not consider the internment decisions as valid precedent for governmental or military detention of individuals or groups without due process of law [...].\\" See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 320 *Ex parte Endo  References  External links  Japanese Relocation (1943 Film ‚Äì viewable for free at not-for profit The Internet Archive) * Eric L.

It is a mental phenomenon by which viewers derive more meaning from the interaction of two sequential shots than from a single shot in isolation. Specifics Example of a Kuleshov sequence, with the last shot changed Kuleshov edited a short film in which a shot of the expressionless face of Tsarist matinee idol Ivan Mosjoukine was alternated with various other shots (a bowl of soup, a girl in a coffin, a woman on a divan). The film was shown to an audience who believed that the expression on Mosjoukine's face was different each time he appeared, depending on whether he was \\"looking at\\" the bowl of soup, the girl in the coffin, or the woman on the divan, showing an expression of hunger, grief, or desire, respectively. The footage of Mosjoukine was actually the same shot each time. Vsevolod Pudovkin (who later claimed to have been the co-creator of the experiment) described in 1929 how the audience \\"raved about the acting... the heavy pensiveness of his mood over the forgotten soup, were touched and moved by the deep sorrow with which he looked on the dead child, and noted the lust with which he observed the woman. But we knew that in all three cases the face was exactly the same.\\" Kuleshov used the experiment to indicate the usefulness and effectiveness of film editing. The implication is that viewers brought their own emotional reactions to this sequence of images, and then moreover attributed those reactions to the actor, investing his impassive face with their own feelings. Kuleshov believed this, along with montage, had to be the basis of cinema as an independent art form. The effect has also been studied by psychologists and is well-known among modern film-makers. Alfred Hitchcock refers to the effect in his conversations with Fran√ßois Truffaut, using actor James Stewart as the example. In the famous \\"Definition of Happiness\\" interview which was part of the CBC Telescope program, Hitchcock also explains in detail many types of editing to Fletcher Markle The final form, which he calls \\"pure editing\\", is explained visually using the Kuleshov effect. In the first version of the example, Hitchcock is squinting, and the audience sees footage of a woman with a baby. The screen then returns to Hitchcock's face, now smiling. In effect, he is a kind old man. In the second example, the woman and baby are replaced with a woman in a bikini, Hitchcock explains: \\"What is he now? He's a dirty old man.\\" The experiment itself was created by assembling fragments of pre-existing film from the Tsarist film industry, with no new material. Mosjoukine had been the leading romantic \\"star\\" of Tsarist cinema, and familiar to the audience. Kuleshov demonstrated the necessity of considering montage as the basic tool of cinema art. In Kuleshov's view, the cinema consists of fragments and the assembly of those fragments, the assembly of elements which in reality are distinct. It is therefore not the content of the images in a film which is important, but their combination. The raw materials of such an art work need not be original, but are pre-fabricated elements which can be disassembled and re-assembled by the artist into new juxtapositions. The montage experiments carried out by Kuleshov in the late 1910s and early 1920s formed the theoretical basis of Soviet montage cinema, culminating in the famous films of the late 1920s by directors such as Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin and Dziga Vertov, among others. These films included The Battleship Potemkin, October, Mother, The End of St. Petersburg, and The Man with a Movie Camera. Research The Kuleshov effect has only been studied by psychologists in recent years. Prince and Hensley (1992) recreated the original study design but did not find the alleged effect. The study had 137 participants but was a single-trial between-subject experiment, which is prone to noise in the data. Mobbs et al. (2006) did a within-subject fMRI study and found an effect for negative, positive, or neutral valence. When a neutral face was shown behind a sad scene, it seemed sad; when it was shown behind a happy scene, it seemed happy. More recently, Barratt, R√©dei, Innes-Ker, and van de Weijer (2016) tested 36 participants using 24 film sequences across five emotional conditions (happiness, sadness, hunger, fear, and desire) and a neutral control condition. Again, they were able to show that neutral faces were rated in accordance with the stimuli material, confirming Mobbs et al. (2006) findings. Thus, despite the initial problems in testing the Kuleshov effect experimentally, researchers now agree that the context in which a face is shown has a significant effect on how the face is perceived. To find out whether the Kuleshov effect can also be induced auditorily, Baranowski and Hecht intercut different clips of faces with neutral scenes, featuring either happy music, sad music, or no music at all. They found that the music significantly influenced participants‚Äô emotional judgments of facial expression.

The film is a sequel to the 1999 film Analyze This. The film starred Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal who respectively reprise their roles as mobster Paul Vitti and psychiatrist Ben Sobel. Following the success of the first film, Warner Bros. developed a follow up to the film, with much of the same cast and crew returning. Analyze That was released on December 6, 2002, however, did not achieve the commercial success that the first film had, grossing only $55 million domestically against its $60 million budget. Plot Near the completion of his sentence in Sing Sing prison, Paul Vitti's life is threatened by assassins and corrupt guards while incarcerated. He starts singing showtunes from West Side Story to get the attention of Ben Sobel, who previously hung up on him while attending his father's funeral. The FBI calls in Ben to perform psychiatric tests on Paul to determine if he is feigning insanity. After the tests, it appears Paul's mental state is deteriorating, and the FBI approves Paul's release for one month, into Ben's custody, for further therapy. As Ben drives Paul from prison, Paul immediately reveals that he was faking. Ben talks Paul into finding a regular job as requested by the FBI. Paul attempts to find a legitimate job (he tries a car dealer, a restaurant, and a jewelry store), but his rude manners and paranoia only complicate things further. This ends up in him getting fired each time. At the same time, Paul is told by de facto boss Patti LoPresti that the Rigazzi family wants him dead. He responds to this by telling the Rigazzis that he is \\"out\\" and seeking a new line of employment. He eventually finds employment working as a technical advisor on the set of a mafia TV series. Meanwhile, FBI agents inform Ben that Paul has his former crew back together, and may be planning something major. This rouses Ben's suspicion, and he visits Paul. Both get caught up in a car chase with Rigazzi hitmen, which ends up with Paul escaping. The FBI blames Ben, and gives him 24 hours to locate Paul. After locating Paul through Ben's son Michael, who is now working as Paul's chauffeur, Ben discovers Paul is planning a big armored car heist with LoPresti as a partner. He attempts to intervene and talk Paul out of it but Paul proceeds and Ben is forced to go along as well. The crew ambushes the armored car with smoke grenades, and lift it over a fence in the midst of the confusion. They extract over $22 million of gold bullion, but LoPresti's thugs take over, revealing themselves to actually have been working for Rigazzi. Ben, in a fit of anger, beats one of them, and Paul's men apprehend the others. They use the gold bullion to frame the Rigazzi family, leaving three Rigazzi goons locked in the armored truck suspended from the crane. This leads to the arrest of the entire Rigazzi family, and in turn, prevents a mob war. Ben meets with Paul and Jelly near bridges on the New York waterfront, and they part ways again as friends, singing another West Side Story showtune together. During the credits, bloopers are shown. Cast Production =Pre-production= Initially, there was no plan to create a sequel to Analyze This, but the critical acclaim and box office success generated by the first film encouraged the producers to consider a sequel and discuss it with the studio and actors. They believed, as said by Crystal, that \\"there was an unfinished relationship between Ben Sobel and Paul Vitti from the first film\\" and \\"there was a good story to tell\\", so the sequel was commissioned. The story of the sequel was inspired by an article in The New York Times about the psychotherapy used in the mafia TV show The Sopranos. Ramis said the article \\"raised questions about human nature and morality...Can the criminal mind be turned?\\" and he became interested in what would happen if \\"Paul Vitti got out of jail and committed himself to going straight.\\" The production arranged for Dr. Stephen A. Sands, a psychiatrist and faculty member of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons to be a technical adviser for the film, and he remained on set during the filming of scenes that involved psychiatric issues. Sands was very familiar with the details of mobster Vincent \\"The Chin\\" Gigante's alleged mental illness, after studying the case during his post-doctoral training. Sands also arranged for De Niro to visit Bellevue Hospital's psychiatric unit to meet patients and psychiatrists to discuss the character's symptoms, and De Niro sometimes participated in group therapy sessions during these visits. =Filming= Filming began in April 2002, and most of the scenes were shot in and around New York City, 7 months after the 9-11 attacks. There is a scene in Analyze This where a helicopter eerily passes through the buildings in the background at the 1h22m mark of the movie. Producer Jane Rosenthal said they decided to shoot the film there because \\"[i]t would have been unpatriotic not to shoot the picture in New York... As a New Yorker it was extremely important for me to get back to work and business as usual after 9-11.\\" Filming locations for Vitti's attempts at lawful employment include an Audi dealership on Park Avenue in Manhattan, a jewelry store in the Diamond District on West 47th Street, and Gallagher's Steak House on West 52nd Street. The prison scenes were filmed at the Riker's Island prison in Queens, with the prison release scene shot outside the entrance to Sing Sing Prison in Ossining, New York. The funeral for Ben's father was filmed at Riverside Memorial Chapel on Manhattan's Upper West Side, and the Sobel household scenes shot in Montclair, New Jersey. The dinner at Nogo restaurant was filmed at West 13th Street in a restaurant that had closed down, and been refurbished by the film's art department. The scenes of Patty LoPresti's home were filmed in Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey, and the Little Caesar set in Washington Square Park, Manhattan. Car chases were filmed on New Jersey Turnpike service roads in Kearney. The heist- planning scenes were shot in two locations: a derelict building in the meat packing district near West 14th Street, and a club called Exit on West 56th Street. The majority of the heist scenes were shot in an empty lot in West 57th Street between 11th and 12th Avenues, and below a West Side Highway underpass. While filming part of the heist sequence at the New York State 369th Regiment armory, on 145th Street and Fifth Avenue, the film set was visited by former President Bill Clinton, who was pleased the movie was being filmed in New York. The scene at a drive-through bank where the money flies before the police chase was filmed in Carlstadt, New Jersey. Cinematographer Ellen Kuras said that in shooting the film, the intention was to highlight the contrast between Vitti and Sobel's environments, because the film \\"exists in two different worlds... We wanted to evoke the contrast so we made Vitti's world cool, blue and blue-green, whereas Ben's world has a brighter, warmer palette, yellows and oranges that provide a neutral tone.\\" Reception =Box office= Analyse That opened in 2,635 theaters and grossed $11 million in its opening weekend. The film went on to gross $32 million at the domestic box office and a further $23 million at the international box office for a worldwide total of $55 million against its $60 million budget. =Critical reception= On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 27% based on 150 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"The one joke premise is stretched a bit thin in this messy sequel, but a few laughs can be had here and there.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on reviews from 34 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B. Roger Ebert gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, and wrote \\"If the first film seemed to flow naturally from the premise, this one seems to slink uneasily onto the screen, aware that it feels exactly like a facile, superficial recycling job.\\" The film won the award for Worst Sequel at the 2002 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards.

Early life Jeni was raised in an Italian-American Roman Catholic family in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. He graduated with honors from Hunter College, earning a bachelor's degree in comparative politics. After graduating, Jeni went on to do public relations work, but was let go from five different firms in two years before doing an open-mic night in Brooklyn and deciding to pursue standup comedy as a career in 1982. Career Jeni first received recognition through a series of Showtime stand-up specials and frequent appearances on The Tonight Show.

History  = Summary of the history of Santa Rosa de Osos = Before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors, Indians Nutabes inhabiting the territory of Santa Rosa de Osos' , were fighters and agile. Working tissue cotton and exploited the gold. They had patriarchal social organization and believed in life after death, hence buried their dead with utensils, jewelry, food and clothing. The northern region of Antioquia where today this municipality is located is a valley that in 1541, discovered the captain Spanish 'conquistador' Francisco Vallejo . The captain called it Valley of the Bears' because there were there many of these animals. And by 1600 explorers and colonists found gold metal abundance in the region. They came by the hundreds, led by another captain, Antonio Serrano y Espejo, whom he corresponded decree the foundation of a settlement on the site, in 1636, which was approved by His Majesty the King Philip IV of Spain. In 1659 district stands in parish, from the bishop of Popayan Bishop Jacinto Vasco de Contreras y Velarde and changes the name to 'San Jacinto de los Osos' . In 1792 was renamed 'Villa de Nuestra Se√±ora de Chiquinquir√° de los Osos' . In 1811 he acquired the name it has today, Santa Rosa de Osos' . The district was built as a municipality in 1814 ordered by the dictator Juan del Corral. In 1917 the Diocese of Santa Rosa de Osos by order of Pope Benedicto XV was established, and investment by Yarce Betancur family, one of the most powerful families in those days and founders of one of the santarosan¬¥s schools. By 1924 was appointed the Bishop Miguel Angel Builes Gomez (missionary bishop of Colombia), who led their destinations for over forty years and founded four religious communities of great importance to the diocese and to the Colombian Catholic Church (the Sisters Teresitas Comtemplativas, Teresitas Missionary Sisters, the Daughters of Our Lady of Mercy and the Xaverian Yarumal) Missionaries. Currently, runs the destinies of the diocese the Bishop Jorge Alberto Ossa Soto. Perhaps that is why this district acquired the nickname The City Religious' . Its history is full of events and characters that defined their Catholic vocation and, therefore, many of its attractions are related to religious tourism: the Cathedral, chapels and monuments that show the fervor that has characterized the santarosan people. Santa Rosa is a great producer of milk and water for the metropolitan area of Aburr√° Valley, which has enabled the construction of reservoirs as the Lakes Riogrande I and II . = Discovery and colonization of Valle De Los Osos = Marshal Jorge Robledo arrived in nearby Anz√° in September 1541, from this place he sent several commissions, including one led by Captain Francisco Vallejo. This came with 40 men heading for the \\"Llanos de Ovejas\\" (Current district of San Pedro de los Milagros), the same San Pedro and Entrerr√≠os. Then, later that same year he discovered a very cold temperature valley which he called \\"\\" Bear¬¥s Valley \\"\\" by many who found. This valley was inhabited by indigenous Nutabes that forced to Vallejo to leave the industry because of the hostilities shown by the native people. How these Indians did not appear to abundant wealth, \\"the Bear¬¥s Valley\\" not made interesting for the ambitious Spanish conquerors; they left in oblivion this place for nearly a century. The apparent poverty of the inhabitants, the Spaniards led to believe that the earth lacked precious minerals and the territory remained \\"virgin\\" and state neglect for a long time; although Don Andres De Valdivia and Don Gaspar De Rodas visit in the mid-sixteenth century the Valley of the Bears in the office of governor of the city of Santa Fe de Antioquia; territory to which it belonged at the time. The first colonizations occurred at the hands of Pedro Gutierrez Colmenero (first mayor of the town of Medellin (1675)) and Don Antonio De Mesa, both natives of Jerez with Juan Nu√±o De Sotomayor discovered in 1645 the minerals of the valley and began operating in the streams: San Juan, La Trinidad, Orobajo, San Jose, San Antonio, Santa Ana and San Lorenzo. How also in the Guadalupe River and Los Martires stream. While Gutierrez Colmenero toiled these mines, Fernando Toro Zapata, captain and official judge of the royal house of the city of Santa Fe de Antioquia, came to work the mines of the Caruquia stream = The Rancheria = The first village was located south of the current city, on the site now occupied by the Arenales neighborhood, which was called to the eighteenth century La Rancheria; the ore of this place was owned by Captain Ignacio Velez De Rivero, like the chapel that existed there in 1740; where the Catholic tradition that the city would have evoked. The rich mineral deposits that were found near the Bramadora, San Juan and San Antonio streams, just at the precise moment when the city of Antioquia gold was running out; attracted a lot of people from this and . C√°ceres estimated that there were over 700 black people dedicated exclusively to tilling mining and more than 500 Spaniards or children of Spaniards in 1650, which in its most, were wealthy gentlemen and distinguished at the time. * 'Destruction of the topography of the urban center of the current Santa Rosa:' In the early years of this settlement gold extraction was done with relative ease on the banks of streams and rivers, always they are characterized by having a calm path; however difficult tilling went slowly when there was need to undertake work on sections of the flow points where it was necessary to conduct the streams in canoes, through the trees or poles anchored to the floor. But often there were points where the waters could not climb, finding far apart or higher than the level thereof; this work forced to the people to carry on their backs the material to be transformed into the precious metal, where in rainy seasons had to fill large reservoirs of water to be used in the ore beneficiation process. Given the \\"technological\\" low knowledge of the time large tracts of land were excavated pits between 10 and 30 meters deep, depending on where it was located the mine site. How many times the material should be taken to other places for washing, gradually the land was changed as it progressed mining, to the point that nowadays huge scars within the city limits of the city are. These processes were improved by then hearer Mon and Velarde who established laws for mining processes, accompanied by Monsieur Laneret or Moneret that the late seventeenth century began riding mills, a much more modern technology for the time. = Party of San Jacinto de los Osos = In the early eighteenth century began a large immigration from Medellin and Rionegro, the population increased so that by 1770 the name was changed to San Jacinto of the Bears. The first priest was Juan Bautista D√°vila Knight, but on previously had lived in the village of Toro Jacinto, who came with Pedro Martin de Mora and Fray Pedro Simon; who wrote a story about the mines. San Jacinto was so widening the eighteenth century there were five chapels outside the parish, among which stands out the Tierradentro. The parish chapel was dedicated in honor of Our Lady of Guadalupe. It was built to commemorate a miracle happened to the person of Pedro Bustamante, Spanish adventurer, who finding himself alone and harassed by the natives, he asked for help to the Virgin of Guadalupe, and come Juan Torres to his aid. However this native mauled Juan and Pedro escaped prodigiously appearing to his soldiers when they celebrated their funeral. The story brings what Dr. Julio Cesar Garcia as happened on the banks of Rio Grande, and this miracle that may give the name to Guadalupe River, although there is no hard historical facts that so affirm. The village cemetery was located where today the Simon Bolivar Park, the main square of the town. For its construction helped Don Pedro Rodriguez de Zea in 1775, who was then serving as governor Site of Los Osos and who gave permission for the foundation of the current municipalities of Yarumal, Don Mat√≠as and Carolina del Principe. * The customs of San Jacinto de los Osos were varied; the main celebrations were held in honor of the patron saint, Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Chiquinquir√° later. The arrival of the bishop of Popay√°n, the marriage of a rich or the coronation of a Spanish monarch was cause for celebration.  The Sombrer√≥n  One of the hidden stories of the past of Santa Rosa de Osos, is the great discrimination that existed towards the colored races. Although Antioquia was characterized as one of the first areas where freedom was given to the slaves, it did not happen in the valley where today the municipality sits, in it all kinds of inhuman treatment were given to the community black by the Spaniards. Within this macabre piece of history, known for its cruelty the marriage of Don Juan Jose Salazar and Mar√≠a del Pardo, who had for pleasure favorite whipping the backs of their slaves and load them with chains. Their acts of cruelty also extended to animals, it is said that flayed the cows to apply salt and then put to death cattle in the midst of the most excruciating pain and howls. Don Juan Jose Salazar who worked in La Trinidad mine, and the site currently occupied by the town of G√≥mez Plata, was characterized by wearing a huge hat, so he was nicknamed \\"The Sombrer√≥n\\". At his death, all residents of the region agreed to apply eternal punishment and among in to simple people the belief that every night going through the town, after death, accompanied by his 2 large dogs. The belief became popular and later became a famous urban legend. In Hoyorrico, santarosan district, it belongs to the historic mine and Chapel of La Trinidad, today remember this character in the name of one of its ancient streets. = Villa de Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario de Chiquinquir√° de los Osos = In 1792 was governor of the province Francisco Baraya and La Campa, was erected in Villa, taking the name in English of Village of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquir√° of the Bears, this fact corresponded to a new mining boom where characters recognized how Zulaibar, they replaced the old wealthy businessmen eighteenth century and established their forming a society of considerable economic and cultural wealth companies. Much of these developments were brought about by a scientific growth of gold mining; Lode mines began to benefit from huge returns, how in Las Cruces and Las Animas streams. Gold fell into a deep decline and this activity was quickly replaced by agriculture and livestock, creating better quality of life to its inhabitants, who were already living in an unhealthy environment caused by the exploitation of minerals. This respite was given to the land of Santa Rosa de Osos it has generdo to become a green city, which has remained so for more than 100 consecutive years with huge economic returns that put the municipality as a pantry of food and water for considered the most prosperous country in the region in terms of quality of life.

He also co-hosts a sports talk radio show on WBZ-FM with former Boston Herald columnist Michael Felger. Massarotti is a graduate of Waltham High School in Waltham, Massachusetts and a 1989 graduate of Tufts University, where he majored in English and Classics. He was also a member of Theta Chi fraternity. He currently resides in Sudbury, Massachusetts. Boston Herald Massarotti joined the Boston Herald in 1989 and covered the Boston Red Sox for the paper from 1994 through 2008. During his time with the Herald, Massarotti frequently covered the Red Sox for Fox Sports New England, and he appeared occasionally as a guest on WHDH's Sports Xtra. He also appeared on Boston's WEEI sports talk radio program The Big Show. These appearances ended with his later leaving the Herald for the Globe due to a long-standing ban on Globe staffers appearing on the station. While with the Herald, Massarotti was known for his staunch support of former Red Sox managers Jimy Williams and Grady Little, despite Little's controversial decisions during Game 7 of the 2003 American League Championship Series. The Boston Globe In September 2008, Massarotti joined the staff of the Boston Globe. In addition to writing a regular column for the paper, Massarotti became the voice and face of the Globe's online Boston.com sports feature. In March 2013, he left the Boston Globe. However, after his brief hiatus, Massarotti returned to writing for the Globe's online sports blog in early 2014. Notable columns =Theo Epstein contract negotiations= On October 27, 2005, Massarotti published a column in which he accused Larry Lucchino and the Red Sox management of smearing general manager Theo Epstein during contract negotiations. In the column, he also suggested that coverage of the negotiations at two local media outlets was compromised. He documented that the New York Times (parent company of the Boston Globe) owned a 17 percent ownership stake in the Red Sox and that local sports talk radio leader WEEI was currently in negotiations for Red Sox broadcast rights and paid Lucchino for a weekly radio appearance. The timing of the column was notable as it came four days after Globe ombudsman Richard Chac√≥n published an article in which he criticized Times management for accepting World Series rings from the Red Sox, and three days prior to a Dan Shaughnessy column in which he revealed information detailing the nuances of the relationship between Epstein and Lucchino, to the favor of Lucchino. The information in the column was widely thought to have originated from Lucchino and may have contributed to Epstein breaking off negotiations and resigning his position as General Manager. =Jon Lester cancer story= In August 2006, Massarotti received some criticism for publishing a column detailing rumors that Red Sox pitcher Jon Lester was being tested for cancer. In fact, the rumors turned out to be true, and Lester went on to be treated for a rare form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

The plot concerns a French officer who is seduced by an intriguing woman who is also a shapeshifting devil. The film is sometimes linked to Corman's Poe cycle, a series of movies based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe; however, The Terror is not based on any text written by Poe. The movie has become famous because of the circumstances of its production, including the fact all of Boris Karloff's scenes were shot in two days, the long time it took to complete, the number of people who worked on it that became famous, and the part the film played in the financing and production of Targets (1968), directed by Peter Bogdanovich, starring Karloff. Corman wrote in his memoirs that The Terror \\"began as a challenge : to shoot most of a gothic film in two days using left over sets from The Raven. It turned into the longest production of my career ‚Äì an ordeal that required five directors and nine months to complete. But like Little Shop [of Horrors], it's a classic story of how to make a film out of nothing.\\"Corman p 88 The film was also released as Lady of the Shadows, The Castle of Terror, and The Haunting. Plot In 1806, Andre Duvalier, a French soldier lost in the Confederation of the Rhine, is saved by Helene, a young woman who bears a resemblance to Ilsa von Leppe, the wife of Baron von Leppe who died 20 years before. Andre sets out to investigate Helene's true identity and, in doing so, learns the Baron's darkest secret: after he found Ilsa with another man, the Baron killed his wife while his servant killed her lover. Over the last two years, the Baron has been tormented by Ilsa's ghost, who has beseeched him to kill himself so that they can be together forever. After much hesitation, the Baron decides to do so and atone for his crimes. Unbeknownst to him, Ilsa's ghost is being commanded to haunt him by a peasant witch named Katrina. After preventing the Baron from killing himself, Andre and Stefan, the Baron's major domo, capture Katrina and force her into compliance. Katrina then reveals herself to be the mother of a man named Eric, whom she believes that the Baron killed 20 years before and hopes to avenge his death by damning his soul to Hell. In a stunning revelation, Stefan reveals that Eric was Ilsa's lover, that it was the Baron who had died 20 years ago, not Eric, and that Eric felt so guilty about it that he took the Baron's place, pretending to be him (thus explaining why the Baron had never left the castle in the past 20 years). Over the years, Eric has convinced himself that he is the true Baron von Leppe. Realizing her error too late, Katrina goes with Andre and Stefan to stop Eric from flooding the castle crypt. Katrina's pact with the devil, however, makes her unable to walk on consecrated ground and she ends up burning to death after being struck by lightning. At the von Leppe castle, Eric floods the crypt as Ilsa's ghost attempts to kill him and Stefan struggles to stop her. By the time Andre gains access to the crypt, it is already starting to cave in and he is only able to save Helene. The two share a moment outside the castle before Helene turns into a rotting corpse. Cast * Boris Karloff as Baron von Leppe/Eric, a corrupt aristocratic man who murdered the baron and his wife and poses as the baron of an abandoned castle. * Jack Nicholson as Andre Duvalier, a soldier of Napoleon's army who finds himself lost after fleeing his men during battle. * Dick Miller as Stefan, the Baron's son and trustful servant who serves the impostor. * Sandra Knight as Helene/Ilsa, the shapeshifting demon of the witch who poses as the baron's deceased wife. * Dorothy Neumann as Katrina the witch, a peasant woman and the mother of Eric who was driven out of the village for heresy and witchcraft. * Jonathan Haze as Gustaf, a lost village man who became the mentally ill servant of the witch. Boris Karloff segment =Development= Roger Corman had enjoyed considerable success in the early 1960s producing and directing films based on the stories of Edgar Allan Poe for AIP: The House of Usher, The Pit and the Pendulum, The Premature Burial, Tales of Terror and The Raven, as well as the Poe-influenced Tower of London. Corman wrote in his memoirs that he was inspired to make The Terror because \\"I was getting so familiar with the standard elements of Poe's material ‚Äì or at least our adaptations ‚Äì that I tried to out-Poe himself and create a Gothic tale from scratch.\\" Corman was making The Raven (1963) featuring sets built by Dan Haller. The weekend before filming was scheduled to end, Corman was meant to play tennis but the game was washed out. Corman came up with the idea of shooting footage of a movie star on the sets of The Raven over two days, which could then be used as the basis of another movie. Corman contacted Leo Gordon, an actor and writer who had written several films for the director, including The Cry Baby Killer and The Wasp Woman, and asked him if he had a script with a castle in it. Gordon did not but went over to Corman's house for a \\"brainstorming\\" session. Corman he asked Gordon for a sixty-page script written by the following weekend which could be shot over two days. Corman says his only other requirement was that the script finish with a flood, as several Poe pictures had finished with a fire sequence, and he wanted to do something new. Corman reportedly paid Gordon $1,600 for the script. According to Dick Miller's account of making The Terror, Corman \\"called Chuck Griffith and said, \\"Write me a bunch of scenes for Boris Karloff and this castle.\\" Chuck said, \\"What's the story?\\" Roger said, \\"No story, just a lot of castle, you know, in and out of doors, very mysterioso.\\" And that's exactly what he did.\\"Miller may have confused Griffith for Leo Gordon. The main role in Gordon's script was that of the Baron, which was devised to be played by a star. All of Corman's Poe films except The Premature Burial had starred Vincent Price but that actor was unavailable, so Corman made a deal with Boris Karloff, who had been in The Raven and Tales of Terror, to be available for two days' filming for a small amount of money, plus a deferred payment of $15,000 that would be paid if the film earned more than $150,000. (Corman says he offered Karloff 10% of the profits above \\"a certain amount.\\"Corman p 141) Gordon's script had three other characters, two male and one female. Corman hired Jack Nicholson and Dick Miller, with whom he had worked several times previously, to play the other male roles. Nicholson suggested his then-wife Sandra Knight for the female role and Corman agreed. (It would be the only time Nicholson and Knight would act together in a film.) The plan was to shoot sixty pages of script over two days, then shoot the rest at a later date when the rest of the script was completed and other sets were available. =Shooting= The first two days of filming on The Terror took place on the weekend after The Raven finished on a Friday. Corman directed all these sequences using the crew from The Raven. According to one report \\"mostly Corman shot people walking down hallways, entering doors and having a few conversations.\\" The director says they had a rough storyline \\"but no one really knew what their character's motivations were because we didn't know what was supposed to happen to them.\\"Corman p 89 The uniform worn by Jack Nicholson was used by Marlon Brando in D√©sir√©e (1954).Mark McGee, Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures, McFarland, 1996, p. 211 Boris Karloff later recalled: > Corman had the sketchiest outline of a story. I read it and begged him not > to do it. He said \\"That's alright Boris, I know what I'm going to do. I want > you for two days on this.\\" I was in every shot, of course. Sometimes I was > just walking through and then I would change my jacket and walk back. He > nearly killed me on the last day. He had me in a tank of cold water for > about two hours. After he got me in the can he suspended operations and went > off and directed two or three operations to get the money, I suppose... [The > sets] were so magnificent... As they were being pulled down around our ears, > Roger was dashing around with me and a camera, two steps ahead of the > wreckers. It was very funny.Lawrence French, \\"The Making of The Raven\\", The > Raven novelisation by Eunice Sudak, based on script by Richard Matheson, > Bear Manor Media, 2012 Corman says they were so pressed for time towards the end of the second day, the crew shot footage without slating the shots. Dick Miller later recalled, \\"When we were shooting in the castle, none of it made any sense. Some of the things I did were ridiculous because I was a butler and I was there just for Karloff to talk to, for Jack to talk to, just a butler.\\" The Raven had been financed by American International Pictures (AIP), but The Terror was financed by Corman privately, albeit using sets that AIP had paid for without asking for their permission. Samuel Z. Arkoff of AIP later said he became suspicious when he attended the wrap party for The Raven and noticed that the sets had not been taken down. He says he later discovered Corman was using AIP sets for the director's own movie but Arkoff knew Corman would \\"put that film in a vault, finish, and come to us [AIP] with a distribution deal. So it turned out to be our picture anyway.\\" Extra footage =Francis Ford Coppola= After the Karloff scenes were shot, Gordon wrote the rest of the script for the movie. Dick Miller says \\"about three months later, when things slowed down\\" he \\"got a call: we were going to make a movie. I had forgotten all about it, literally. \\" Corman could not direct the rest of the film himself. He said after shooting the Karloff sequences \\"I didn't have the money to shoot the rest of the picture union, which meant I couldn't direct myself because I was personally signed with the unions.\\" Corman had recently hired Francis Ford Coppola to work as his assistant on Battle Beyond the Sun and The Haunted Palace, and assigned him to direct the rest of The Terror. Coppola went to Big Sur for what was meant to be three days to shoot additional footage using a crew of film students from UCLA. Nicholson says this involved \\"the stuff along the beach and the rocks with Jackie Haze, the horse, Helene, the young woman, and the witches raven.\\"Corman p 93 The crew included Jack Hill, who had done a number of jobs for Corman, and Gary Kurtz, who met Coppola during the making of the movie, starting a long collaboration between the men. The unit ended up staying at Big Sur for eleven days. Nicholson said Coppola went over schedule and budget because \\"he just went ahead and did whatever he wanted\\"Corman p 94 which infuriated Corman. \\"We all thought we'd be machine gunned or fired forever out of the business\\", said the actor.Corman p 93 Jack Hill, who worked mostly as a sound recordist and second unit director, recalled \\"a major portion of his [Coppola's] script was day-for-night and he did not tell the cameraman that it was supposed to be night and the cameraman shot it for day. Because of the continuity in the story it was impossible to use that footage because it had to intercut with real night scenes.\\" Nicholson says he almost drowned shooting a scene in the ocean at Big Sur ‚Äì he was knocked over by a wave and his uniform almost dragged him down. During the shoot at Big Sur, Sandra Knight fell pregnant to Jennifer, her daughter with Nicholson.Corman p 93 Corman says once there Coppola decided to \\"change and improve the script\\" and came back with footage that \\"didn't exactly mesh with what I had shot. But it still looked pretty good.\\" =Dennis Jakob= Corman still needed more footage for the flooding sequence, but then Coppola accepted a job at Seven Arts and was no longer available to do the required work. Coppola recommended a friend from UCLA, Dennis Jakob, who Corman hired to shoot shots of water at Hoover Dam. Corman says Jakob took three days and used Corman's camera and equipment to shoot his thesis movie on the side. Corman was annoyed but knew this was the sort of thing Corman liked to do himself. He used Jakob as Karloff's stand in for later scenes.Corman p 91-92 =Monte Hellman= Corman felt The Terror still required more work, so he hired Monte Hellman to shoot exteriors at the cliffs of Palos Verdes with Nicholson and Miller and scenes at Santa Barbara. Nicholson says this involved \\"more raven stuff, more scenes with Jackie Haze.\\" Jack Hill was hired to re-write the script for these sequences. Hill later said. \\"We salvaged whatever footage we could salvage that was usable from what Francis shot, which was quite a bit, and then I wrote yet a new story. It required a whole change in story... That's when I got the screen credit for working on the script because eventually quite a bit of what I wrote was in the final picture and a lot of what Francis did was thrown out.\\" Monte Hellman said he \\"found the challenge of making a movie in five days exciting, especially with no budget.\\" Corman says Hellman's footage changed the storyline once more \\"but it looked alright\\" .Corman p 92 =Jack Hill= More work needed to be done on the movie when Hellman was hired on another job, so Corman used Jack Hill to finish the movie. Corman says Hill was called away just before the end, so Jack Nicholson directed on the last day. It was the first time Nicholson had directed a film. However Hill denies Nicholson directed any footage on The Terror, claiming it was Corman who directed the last day. \\"This was about a year later\\", said Hill, \\"I mean it took about a year for all this to go down, and he brought in a double for Boris Karloff, Dennis Jakob, who looks as much like Boris as I do. That was kind of the ending, where the water comes in, the rocks and everything fall, and if you look carefully you‚Äôll notice that there's rocks floating on the water. He used a double for Sandra Knight.\\" Hill says by the end of the shoot Sandra Knight had become pregnant, \\"and that's why in those final scenes of the movie she's only shown above the waist and you‚Äôll notice her breasts are four times the size they are in earlier scenes.\\" Miller later reflected: > In the rewrite I became the heavy. Now all these scenes I were played with > different dimensions with fantastic character changes. So this came out at > different levels, as well as my hair length and body weight. I was walking > in and out of doors changing 20 pounds during this picture. And because the > one part was shot in the winter and the other in the summer, my color would > change. I would leave the castle white, come into the sunlight and I was > practically black, really suntanned. And my hair was a different length; my > sideburns were moving up and down. It was a wild thing. The tree against which Sandra Knight expires in The Terror is the same one to which Price was tied and burned in The Haunted Palace. =Corman reshoots= Corman says when he cut together the work of the five directors \\"we all had interpreted the story differently and it showed. I saw two things working against it. There were some gaps in logic; and frankly it struck me as a little dull.\\" Corman felt the story \\"made sense but it had no spark. It all seemed so predictable.\\" He also felt the lighting from the first two days was flat. Corman says that when he cut together Karloff's footage, he realized that \\"it didn't make sense\\" so he filmed a scene between Dick Miller and Jack Nicholson (in close-up because the sets had been taken down) and got them to explain the plot. This involved the twist that the Baron was not the Baron.Corman p 93 Corman says he shot this scene between Nicholson and Miller on the last day of The Haunted Palace using the crew from that film. Nicholson later reflected on the movie fondly, saying, \\"I had a great time. Paid the rent. They don't make movies like The Terror anymore.\\"Corman p 94 Reception The film was released on a double feature with Dementia 13 in September 1963.Horror bill announced. (1963, Sept. 19). Los Angeles Times =Critical= The Los Angeles Times thought The Terror was \\"spooky\\" with a \\"slow, lazy plot\\" and \\"Excellent photography and settings... it moves like a stately pavan but the authors exhibit some of that old Edgar Allan Poe touch for haunted happenings\\". Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes shows a 36% score based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 5.0/10. Targets In May 1966, Corman told Karloff he would not be getting his deferred $15,000 since the film never made $150,000. However, he said he would pay the money if Karloff worked on a new undetermined future project for Corman. This turned out to be the Peter Bogdanovich film Targets (1968).Fred Olen Ray, The New Poverty Row: Independent Filmmakers as Distributors, McFarland, 1991, p 50-58 Karloff was paid his deferred fee once he agreed to be in the movie. Bogdanovich says Corman told him he would finance a feature if Bogdanovich could use twenty minutes of new Karloff footage, twenty minutes of The Terror, and forty minutes of new material with other actors. Bogdanovich watched The Terror and felt he thought it was \\"an abomination\\", but said that gave him the idea of opening his movie with Karloff watching himself in The Terror and calling the movie terrible. Other appearances Clips from the film appeared in Hollywood Boulevard (1976). In 2010, the film was featured in the second episode of the revived, syndicated TV series Elvira's Movie Macabre. The climax scene was shown in the 2013 film Avenged. 1990s version Today, the film is in the public domain, since there is no copyright notice in the credits for the film. In the early 1990s, actor Dick Miller, who plays Karloff's major domo, was hired to shoot new scenes to use as a framing sequence for an overseas version of The Terror. Under this scheme, the main action of the film is presented in flashback. This was done for Corman to establish some sort of copyright in the movie. Dick Miller says the payment for these scenes was the most he had ever received from Corman. Home video The Terror, restored from original 35mm elements, was released April 26, 2011 from Film Chest and HD Cinema Classics. It is presented in widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16 x 9 and 5.1 surround sound mix.

It is part of the subregion of Northeastern Antioquia, located 108 km from Medell√≠n. History Yolomb√≥ is an indigenous term that comes from the area. In 1535, Don Pedro de Heredia, the founder of Cartagena de Indias, discovered, in the Antioquian region, a village of indigenous people of the same name, Yolomb√≥. The town was initially called, \\"San Lorenzo de Yolomb√≥.\\" No official date of its founding is known to exist. In the middle of the 17th century, gold was found in the area and made Yolomb√≥ a celebrated and important town. Parish records revealed the growing prominence of the town by the settlement of high ranking Spanish families. Up until 1750, its prosperity earned Yolomb√≥ the name, Ciudad Illustre (Illustrious City). However, the prosperity was short lived. Between 1760 and 1800 the gold mines were depleted with the advent and use of efficient mining technology. Following this economic decline, Yolomb√≥ was downgraded to a township of the city Santo Domingo in 1879 until 1883. In 1883 Yolomb√≥ was once again promoted to the status of District and Township and it has remained as such until 2009 when it became a municipality. Yolomb√≥ has a diverse climate and rich biodiversity. At 1,450 km above sea level, the mountainous landscape offers both scorching and frigid temperatures.

It was built in the usual Royal Dutch manner for camps in remote locations: with large comfortable modern houses, plenty of potable water, electricity, air conditioning, theater, social club with many amenities including olimpic pool, basquetball court, 18 hole golf course, bowling alley, large soccer field sewage system, schools, small hospital with many specialists, bilingual school, a small refinery to supply gasoline to domestic vehicles, excellent well maintained roadways, landing strip for small planes, radio and telephone communications, etc. These were (and would be today) considered luxuries and attracted -as many enclave developments in remote areas do- a large number of settlers in the periphery of the oil production facilities. The oil company had acquired rights for a 40 year exploitation of the oil fields, until 1985 but resigned in 1981 under pressure from FARC terrorist and invaders. The production facilities and camp installations were turned in to the government and were mostly ransacked and destroyed by thieves.

Geography Puerto Berr√≠o Puerto Berr√≠o is located in a region of Antioquia known as the Middle Magdalena (near the Magdalena River). It is bounded on the north by the municipalities of Yolomb√≥, Remedios and Yond√≥, on the east by the department of Santander, on the south by the municipalities of Puerto Nare and Caracol√≠, and on the west by the municipalities of Caracol√≠ and Maceo. It is some 191 km away from the city of Medell√≠n, capital of Antioquia. The municipality has an extension of 1,184 km¬≤. History Puerto Berrio was founded in 1875 by Colombian General Ricardo Maria Giraldo. It became a municipality in 1881. In 1801, Alexander von Humboldt drew up an official sketch of the place then known as Great Eddy in the region of the today Puerto Berr√≠o. Later, the Cuban engineer Francisco Javier Cisneros, constructor of the Antioquia Railway, selected this same place to construct a port for the department of Antioquia by the Magdalena river, and also establish it as a railroad station. In 1875, the government of Antioquia ordered by decree the official establishment of the town and named it after former governor of Antioquia and General of Colombia Pedro Justo Berr√≠o. Since then Puerto Berr√≠o's development has been tied to the railroad. When the railways extended to Medell√≠n in 1914 Puerto Berrio became an important port for shipments of products going over the Magdalena river, distributing Antioquia products to other main ports over the river and exports to through the Caribbean sea. In 1925, a fire devastated all the population, with the exception of the facilities of the Railroad. The town went through a reconstruction process to quickly recover. Puerto Berr√≠o became epicenter of the regional commerce and site forced for the transit of load, passengers and tourists. This although economic one lasted until 1963, when Railroad of Antioquia was nationalized. Due to intensification of the Colombian armed conflict the flow of the economy drastically decreased. In 1991 in an effort to recover the government helped establish an association to recover the navigation. This was created, with constitutional rank, the Corporation of the Great river of the Magdalena, in order to recover the navigability of the river. Nowadays, it is an intermediate city of great commercial movement, and is considered the capital of the Antioquian Mid-Magdalena, with a history related to Magdalena river and to Railroad of Antioquia . Its condition of multimodal port, the possibility of connection with Medell√≠n, Bogot√°, department of Santander and North Coast by land, and their airport, has been determining in the development of the region.

The official name of the City is \\"Ciudad Santiago de Arma de Rionegro\\". Rio Negro means \\"Black River\\" in Spanish, as the city received its name after a river that looks black because of the shadows cast by trees. The river traverses the city and it is the most prominent geographical feature of the municipality. Rionegro is also sometimes called the Cuna de la democracia (Cradle of democracy) as it was one of the most important cities during the era of the Colombia's struggle for independence and the 1863 constitution was written in the city.  History  The territory was first mentioned in 1541 by the Spanish Lieutenant √Ålvaro de Mendoza. When the Field Marshal Jorge Robledo took possession of the Valley of Aburr√°, he was commissioned by Alvaro de Mendoza. According to Fray Pedro Sim√≥n, Robledo was the first Iberian man who discovered the Valley of San Nicol√°s on 2 September 1541. Don Juan Daza, a Spaniard of illustrious lineage, took possession of the lands sometime later, and on 8 November 1581, in agreement with the rituals of the laws of Indias, nailed his sword in the ground marking it as an inhabited place and began constructing a farm. Immigration to Rionegro came from numerous regions of the country, including from the same provincial capital of the time, Santa Fe de Antioquia and the original ranch grew into a village and then a town in the first half of the 17th century. The chapel, Concatedral de San Nicol√°s el Magno, consecrated to Saint Nicholas was built as early as 1642, another reason why the territory reached a greater degree of independence for religious reasons. In 1783, Rionegro had become like a municipality, resulting in becoming the City of Santiago de Arma de Rionegro in 1786, with administrative powers under certification of King Carlos III, issued in the Palace of San Idelfonso on 25 September 1786. Rionegro grew in the 19th century and was an important center during the time it was a Spanish colony, and in the early years of Independence. The city then rivaled Santa Fe de Antioquia to compete for the capital of Antioquia, until the city of Medell√≠n grew prominently and far exceeded the growth of these cities. Geography and climate The municipality of Rionegro is located in the central mountain range of the Andes in eastern Antioquia. With a total area of 196 km¬≤, is part of the sub-region of Eastern Antioquia. The city is surrounded in the north by the municipalities of Guarne and San Vicente, in the east by the municipalities of Marinilla and El Carmen de Viboral, in the south by the municipality of La Ceja, and in the west by the municipalities of El Retiro and Medellin. The city of Rionegro is located at , at an average elevation of 2,125 metres above sea level. The average annual precipitation varies between 1,800 and 2,500 millimeters with an average temperature of 17 ¬∞C. Much of the land consists of volcanic ashes and soils with a high resistance to the erosion. Rural Rionegro The altitude of the rest of the territory varies between the 2,100 and the 2,600 metres, and the topography is characterised by a number of small hills, some of which may rise to a greater height and slope like Cerro del Capiro, located in limits with the municipality of La Ceja. A sharper mountainous system emerges towards the West of the municipality, which becomes a physical barrier between the Valley of the Aburr√° and the Plateau of Rionegro, from where the main affluents of the Negro River are born. The main hills of the mountainous chain that surround the Valley by Rionegro are: Alto Gordo, Alto de Amariles, Alto de Salazar o La Pilastra, Cerro Verde, Alto de Careperro, Alto de Pantanillo, Cerro Corcovado and Cerro del Capiro. Part of the city is an alluvial plain of the Negro River and its tributaries, which also include the Pantanillo River and the gorges such as Las Palmas and Esp√≠ritu Santo y Fizebad. Historically the Negro River divided the valley in two, with the Valley of Llanogrande and the Valley of San Nicholas. Hydroelectric companies operate in the area, and have constructed a Hydroelectric Power station at Guatap√© with the Santa Rita Dam. Today the hydroelectric complex of Eastern Antioquia consists of five power stations, two of which are public companies of Medell√≠n city.

The council is the associated executive organization of the municipality with obligation to take responsibility for Rionegro's territorial jurisdiction. Amongst its functions are approving the proposals and projects of the mayor, and with financial obligation to draw up the budget and to take responsibility of collecting rents and taxes. Administratively the Mayorship of Rionegro is divided in two main groups, the chief central administration and the decentralized organizations. These organizations are denominated Secretaries, whose main objective is the benefit of services to the community.  Economy  From many years ago, Rionegro has become the most important trade center in eastern Antioquia, due to its strategical position in the subregion. The city's dramatic growth has situated it as one of the richest cities in Colombia; its economy is mainly based on industries of all kinds, food industries, fabric industries, paper industries, chemical industries, and trade which brings Rionegro's people one of the highest standards of living in the country. Agriculture also plays an important role in the local economy; The main activities are: floriculture and poultry production.  Transport  Jos√© Mar√≠a C√≥rdova International Airport Rionegro has private shuttles that serve all the city's neighborhoods and bus routes throughout the city which connect it to Medell√≠n and the other surrounding municipalities. Taxis are also well used in the urban area. Located within Rionegro city is Jos√© Mar√≠a C√≥rdova International Airport, the second most important airport in Colombia, which serves Medell√≠n. Both domestic and international flights arrive and depart from this airport.

It is bordered on the north by the municipalities of La Estrella, Itag√º√≠ and Envigado, on the east by the municipality of Envigado, on the south by the municipality of Caldas, and on the west by the municipality of La Estrella. It is the smallest municipality in Colombia, with only 15 km¬≤. It is known as the Municipio Modelo de Colombia (\\"Model Municipality of Colombia\\") or the Vallecito de Encanto (\\"Charming little Valley\\"). The municipality owes its name to the diminutive \\"sabana,\\" a Spanish word meaning \\"savannah\\". The population receives an influx of visitors on the weekends because of its reputation for having outstanding entertainment venues.  History  Sabaneta was initially inhabited by the Anacona indigenous peoples (aboriginals from the other side of the An√°), who settled the eastern slope, starting from the hill of Pan de Azucar. In 1750, Spanish families settled here. The Montoya, Restrepo, V√©lez, D√≠az, D√≠ez, V√°squez, Guzm√°n, Garc√©s, Baena, Salazar, Mej√≠a, Mesas, √Ålvarez and Soto families were the second group to populate this region.  Geography  Sabaneta, which sits at the south end of the Aburr√° Valley, is part of the process of conurbation of the Medell√≠n Metropolitan Area, being located 14 kilometers from the center of the city of Medell√≠n. The municipality has an area of 15 km¬≤, of which 67% of the territory is urban. Its topography varies from flat reliefs and slight hills to places with steep slopes. Its most notable heights are those of Piedras Blancas (2,650 mamsl) in La Romera, the Cuchilla Santa Teresa (2,200 mamsl), the hill of Los Gallinazos in Pan de Az√∫car (1,800 mamsl), the hill Morr√≥n, La Siberia and the Anc√≥n. The main stream is the Medell√≠n River, which serves as its border with the municipality Itag√º√≠. The most important tributary of this river, in the municipality, is the La Doctora gorge, along with the streams Buenavista, La Escuela, El Gusano, El Canal√≥n, La Honda, La Sabanetica and La Cien Pesos, which mark its borders with Envigado.

In oceanography and limnology, the sediment‚Äìwater interface is the boundary between bed sediment and the overlying water column. The term usually refers to a thin layer (approximately 1 cm deep, though variable) of water at the very surface of sediments on the seafloor. In the ocean, estuaries, and lakes, this layer interacts with the water above it through physical flow and chemical reactions mediated by the micro-organisms, animals, and plants living at the bottom of the water body. The topography of this interface is often dynamic, as it is affected by physical processes (e.g. currents causing rippling or resuspension) and biological processes (e.g. bioturbation generating mounds or trenches). Physical, biological, and chemical processes occur at the sediment-water interface as a result of a number of gradients such as chemical potential gradients, pore water gradients, and oxygen gradients.  Definition  The location of the top of the sediment-water interface in the water column is defined as the break in the vertical gradient of some dissolved component, such as oxygen, where the concentration transitions from higher concentration in the well-mixed water above to a lower concentration at the sediment surface. This can include less than 1 mm to several mm of the water column.  Physical processes  Waves and tidal currents can alter the topography of the sediment-water interface by forming sand ripples, like the ones shown here that are exposed at low tide. Physical movement of water and sediments alter the thickness and topography of the sediment-water interface. Sediment resuspension by waves, tides, or other disturbing forces (e.g. human feet at a beach) allows sediment pore water and other dissolved components to diffuse out of the sediments and mix with the water above. For resuspension to occur the movement of water has to be powerful enough to have a strong critical shear stress that is greater than the bed shear stress. For example, a very consolidated bed would only be resuspended under a high critical shear stress, while a \\"fluff layer\\" of very loose particles could be resuspended under a low critical shear stress. Depending on the type of lake, there can be a number of mixing events each year that can influence the sediment interface. Amictic lakes are permanently stratified, similarly, meromictic lakes do not mix. Polymictic lakes undergo frequent mixing and dimictic lakes mix twice a year. This type of lake mixing is a physical process that can be driven by overlaying winds, temperature differences, or shear stress within the lake. Physical processes that affect the sediment-water interface include, but are not limited to: * Resuspension * Deposition * Rippling (either small wave ripples or giant current ripples) * Turbidity currents * Bed consolidation  Biological processes  Bioturbation mixes sediments and changes the topography of the sediment-water interface, as shown by time lapse photogrpahy of lugworms moving through sediment. Interactions between sediments and organisms living within sediments can also alter the fluxes of oxygen and other dissolved components in and out of the sediment-water interface. Animals like worms, mollusks and echinoderms can enhance resuspension and mixing through movement and construction of burrows. Microorganisms such as benthic algae can stabilize sediments and keep the sediment-water interface in a more stable condition by building mats. These microalgal mats' stabilizing effect is in part due to the stickiness of the exopolymeric substances (EPS) or biochemical \\"glue\\" that they secrete. Biological processes that affect the sediment-water interface include, but are not limited to: * Bioturbation * Biofilms * Bacterial use of different chemical \\"food\\" (see Redox reactions) * Remineralization of organic carbon and detritus  Chemical Processes  There are several chemical processes that happen abiotically (chemical reactions), as well as biotically (microbial or enzyme mediated reactions). For example, oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions can occur simply through the reactions of elements, or by oxidizing/reducing bacteria. The transformations and turnover of elements between sediments and water occur through abiotic chemical processes and microbiological chemical processes. = Abiotic Chemical Processes = Chemical reactions can occur at the sediment-water interface, abiotically. Examples of this would include the oxygenation of lake sediments as a function of free iron content in the sediment (i.e. pyrite formation in sediments), as well as sulfur availability via the sulfur cycle. Sedimentation is often the final scavenging process that takes trace chemicals and elements out of the water column. Sediments at this interface are more porous and can hold a larger volume of pore water in the interstitial sites due to high organic matter content and lack of settling. Therefore, chemical compounds in the water can undergo two main processes here: 1) diffusion and 2) biological mixing. Chemical diffusion into and out of the interstitial sites occurs primary through random molecular movement. While diffusion is the primary mode through which chemicals interact with the sediments, there are a number of physical mixing processes which facilitate this process (see Physical Processes section). Chemical fluxes are dependent on several gradients such as, pH and chemical potential. Based on a specific chemical's partitioning parameters, the chemical may stay suspended in the water column, partition to biota, partition to suspended solids, or partition into the sediment. In addition, Fick's first law of diffusion states that the rate of diffusion is a function of distance; as time goes on, the concentration profile becomes linear. The availability of a variety of lake contaminants is determined by which reactions are taking place within the freshwater system. The sulfur cycle is a great example of lake nutrient cycling that occurs via biologically mediated processes as well as chemical redox reactions. Chemical reactions at the sediment water interface are listed here below: * Oxygen Consumption- O2 \\\\--> H2O * Denitrification- NO3 \\\\--> N2 * Manganese Reduction- MnIV \\\\--> MnII * Iron Reduction- FeIII \\\\--> FeII * Sulfate Reduction- SO4 \\\\--> HS * Methane Formation- CH2O --> CO2, CH4 = Biologically Mediated Chemical Processes =  Lakes  When moving from the overlying waters to the sediment-water interface there is a 3-5 order of magnitude increase in the number of bacteria. While bacteria are present at the interface throughout the lake basin, their distributions and function vary with substrate, vegetation, and sunlight. For example, the bacterial population at the sediment-water interface in a vegetative littoral zone tends to be larger than the population of the deeper profundal zone, due to higher organic matter content in the former. And, a functional artifact of heavy vegetation at the interface might be a greater number of Azotobacter, a genus of bacteria that can fix N2 to ionic ammonium (NH4+). Even though basin morphometry plays a role in the partitioning of bacteria within the lake, bacterial populations and functions are primarily driven by the availability of specific oxidants/electron acceptors (e.g., O2, NO3‚àí, SO4‚àí, CO2). These constituents, diffused from the overlying water or the underlying sediment, can be used and/or formed during bacterial metabolism by different organisms or be released back into the water column. The steep redox gradients present at/within the sediment-water interface allow for a variety of aerobic and anaerobic organisms to survive and a variety of redox transformations to take place. Here are just a few of the microbial-mediated redox reactions that can take place within the sediment water interface. * Aerobic Respiration * Nitrogen Fixation * Denitrification [Anammox] * Manganese Reduction * Iron Reduction * Sulfate Reduction * Methanogenesis  See also  * Anoxic waters * Benthos * Benthic zone * Benthic boundary layer * Biogeochemical cycle * Nepheloid layer * Sediment transport  References  Category:Oceanography ","title":"Sediment‚Äìwater interface"},{"id":"2514007","text":"Fishing lake in San Jer√≥nimo San Jer√≥nimo is a town and municipality in the Colombian department of Antioquia.

The average temperature in San Luis is 28 Celsius or about 82 Fahrenheit. The municipality is located from the city of Medell√≠n, the capital of the department, and the municipality has an area of .  Initial settlement  Compared to other cities and municipalities in Antioquia, San Luis has a relatively short history. Migration to the region began in 1875 and continued throughout the late 19th century, driven by economic hardship in the region and a spirit of entrepreneurship and colonial expansion that was dominant during that time. The founder of San Luis is widely considered to be Clemente Giraldo, a Presbyterian priest who sought to create a trading outpost between the cities of Granada and the R√≠o Magdalena. Upon arriving in the region from Granada with several families, Giraldo reached a large stone cliff, named \\"el Castell√≥n\\" in Spanish, on August 25, 1876, ow considered the official founding date of the municipality. Having found a defensible site in the mountains with plenty of forestry and available wood, Giraldo decided that this would be a very suitable site for the outpost. The settlers tested the fertility of the soil by planting banana trees, beans, sugar cane, and yuca and, after a successful harvest, returned to Granada to deliver news regarding the new settlement.Descubrimiento, fundaci√≥n, historia del Departamento de Antioquia.

Once news of the successful settlement spread, additional settlers arrived from the nearby towns of El Pe√±ol, Marinilla, and El Santuario. By 1878, the town had constructed its first church, a central park and was integrated as a segment of the municipality of San Carlos.  Effects of the Colombian conflict  Since the 1960s, San Luis suffered a great deal during the Colombian Conflict, especially between 1994 and 2004. The city was frequently targeted by various terrorist and paramilitary organizations, including the FARC, ELN, and Frente IX and was subject to kidnappings, murders, and forced displacements. In 1997 alone there were 255 disappearances, 75 murders, 305 kidnappings and 51,513 displaced persons. By 1999, San Luis was an active war zone and many families fled to other parts of the country. The period between 1999 and 2003 included several direct attacks on police and soldiers in the municipality. On December 12, 1999, 300 members of the FARC from the 9th and 47th fronts attacked the city's police station killing 9 policemen and wounding 4. One of the dead was Irma Rosa Guti√©rrez, who was 6 months pregnant. On October 9, 2002, the FARC strapped bombs to an 11-year-old boy and sent him into the police station in the city's central park. The explosive was detected before it could be exploded.  Post-conflict history  San Luis has flourished since 2006, both economically and culturally. Argos S.A., Colombia's largest producer of cement, first set up operations in San Luis in 1985, but significantly expanded those operations in 2006, employing more than 500 people and investing more than $700 million US dollars. Since 2015, the city has seen accelerated construction including a new, ongoing investment named Porvenir II, creating a dam, a hydropower plant, and a lake that is expected to attract even more tourism.  Demography  * 'Total' Population: 10 939 hab. (2015) * 'Urban' Population: 4694 * 'Rural' Population: 6245  Economy  The economy of San Luis is agriculture based, which is heavily based upon fruits, vegetables, livestock, and an emphasis is placed on harvesting and on the exportation of wood. The city's exportation of wood is celebrated the last weekend of June each year in the \\"Fiestas de la Madera\\" (Festival of the Wood).  Ecotourism  San Luis is still emerging as a tourist destination, and the tourism industry is focused upon eco-friendly tourism. The municipality has several interesting tourism destinations that are utilized both by visitors and locals alike. * Cascada la Cuba (Waterfall The Cuba), is located at the side of the road that leads into the city, about 1.6 km from the Medellin-Bogota highway. The waterfall has a drop of more than 100m and is visited for its clean and clear water and natural environment. * Cascada La Planta (Waterfall The Plant). This second waterfall requires the traveler to walk down a steep and narrow stone path. The waterfall is 30m contains a 15m x 10m body of water at the bottom in which visitors can swim. There is also an unsupervised diving platform to dive into the water below. * El Dormil√≥n (River Dormil√≥n). The banks of the river are often used for picnics and the currents are such that one can swim in the river without much danger. * Iglesia de San Luis Gonzaga (Church of San Luis Gonzaga).

He is a saint in the Roman Catholic Church and in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Life and historicity According to a Veronese author named Coronato, a notary of the 7th century, Zeno was a native of Mauretania. He taught many children of Africa about the Catholic religion and he also helped them with their school work. The children could rely on someone who could help them. Another theory is that Zeno was a follower of Athanasius, patriarch of Alexandria, who accompanied his master when the latter visited Verona in 340. The style of the 90 or so Sermones attributed to Zeno has also been considered evidence of his African origins due to its literary style, since Christian African writers of the time frequently used neologisms and wordplay. Many of the Sermones concern Old Testament exegesis and \\"have a definite anti-Semitic element in them\\".Alban Butler, David Hugh Farmer, Paul Burns, Butler's Lives of the Saints (Continuum International Publishing Group, 1995), 85. Staying in the city, Zeno entered the monastic life, living as a monk until around 362, when he was elected successor to the See of Verona after the death of Bishop Gricinus (Cricinus, Cricino). Zeno had \\"received a good classical education\\",Alban Butler, David Hugh Farmer, Paul Burns, Butler's Lives of the Saints (Continuum International Publishing Group, 1995), 84‚Äì5. and as bishop baptized many people, won converts back from Arianism, lived a life of poverty, trained priests to work in the diocese, set up a convent for women, reformed how the Agape feast was celebrated, and forbade funeral masses being accompanied by attendees' loud groans and wailing. Zeno‚Äôs other reforms included instructions concerning adult baptism (which occurred by complete immersion) and issuing medals to people newly baptized to the Catholic faith. Zeno's episcopate lasted for about ten years, and the date of his death is sometimes given as 12 April 371. Zeno is described as a confessor of the faith in early martyrologies. Saint Gregory the Great calls him a martyr in his Dialogues; Saint Ambrose, a contemporary of Zeno, does not. Ambrose speaks of Zeno's \\"happy death\\", although as a confessor, Zeno may have suffered persecution (but not execution) during the reigns of Constantius II and Julian the Apostate. The entry in the current Roman Martyrology lists him on 12 April, but makes no mention of martyrdom.Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2004), p. 232. The first evidence for his existence is found in a letter written by Saint Ambrose to Bishop Syagrius of Verona in which Ambrose refers to the holiness of Zeno. Later, Bishop Saint Petronius of Verona (r. 412‚Äì429) wrote of Zeno‚Äôs virtues and also confirmed the existence of a cult dedicated to Saint Zeno. A poem written between 781 and 810, called the Versus de Verona, an elegy of the city in verse, states that Zeno was the eighth bishop of Verona. Veneration San Zeno Altarpiece. Zeno is on the far right. Zeno‚Äôs liturgical feast day is celebrated on 12 April, but in the diocese of Verona, it is also celebrated on 21 May, in honor of the translation of his relics on 21 May 807. St Zeno's body ready for his feast day procession on 21 May 2012 Tradition states that Zeno built the first basilica in Verona, situated in the area probably occupied by the present-day cathedral. His eponymous church in its present location dates to the early ninth century, when it was endowed by Charlemagne and his son Pepin, King of Italy. It was consecrated on 8 December 806; two local hermits, Benignus and Carus, were assigned the task of translating Zeno‚Äôs relics to a new marble crypt. King Pepin was present at the ceremony, as were the Bishops of Cremona and Salzburg, as well as an immense crowd of townspeople. The church was damaged at the beginning of the tenth century by Hungarians, though the relics of Zeno remained safe. The basilica was rebuilt again, and made much larger and stronger. Financial support was provided by Otto I, and it was re- consecrated in 967, at a ceremony presided over by the Bishop Ratherius of Verona. The present church of San Zeno in Verona is a work of the twelfth, thirteenth and early fifteenth centuries for the most part. It is well known for its bronze doors (c. 1100 - c. 1200) which depict, besides stories from the Bible, the miracles of Saint Zeno, images drawn from stories, including those recorded by the notary Coronato, the facade sculpture signed by Nicholaus and an associate Guglielmus, and the rose window (c. 1200), which is the work of Brioloto. Legends and iconography The Adige flowing through Verona Zeno is the patron saint of fishermen and anglers, the city of Verona, newborn babies as well as children learning to speak and walk. Some 30 churches or chapels have been dedicated to him, including Pistoia Cathedral. According to legend he was stolen at birth and briefly replaced by a demonic changeling. One story relates that Saint Zeno, one day fishing on the banks of the Adige, which he did in order to feed himself (rather than as recreation), saw a peasant crossing the river in a horse and cart. The horses began to get strangely skittish. Zeno, believing this to be the work of the devil, made the sign of the cross, and the horses calmed down. Zeno was often said to combat the devil, and is sometimes depicted treading on a demon. Another story relates that he exorcised a demon from the body of the daughter of the Emperor Gallienus (though Zeno probably did not live during the reign of Gallienus). The story relates that the grateful Gallienus allowed Zeno and other Christians freedom of worship in the empire. Saint Gregory the Great, at the end of the 6th century, relates a miracle associated with the divine intercession of Zeno. In 588, the Adige flooded its banks, inundating Verona. The floodwater reached the church dedicated to Saint Zeno, but miraculously did not enter it, even though the door was wide open. The church was donated to Theodelinda, an alleged eyewitness to the miracle and wife of king Authari. Zeno is most often represented with fishing-related items such as a fish, fishing rod, or as a bishop holding a fishing rod, or with a fish hanging from his crozier. \\"Local tradition says the bishop was fond of fishing in the nearby river Adige,\\" writes Alban Butler, \\"but it is more likely that originally it was a symbol of his success in bringing people to baptism.\\"  References  * Nicholas Everett, Patron Saints of Early Medieval Italy AD c.350-800 (PIMS/ Durham University Press, 2016), pp.60-72.

Career In the meantime the job had been taken on a caretaker basis by first Ruth Caleb (Head of Drama at BBC Wales) and then Alan Yentob (Director of Television). Adams had initially been brought in to assist Yentob in running the department in an administrative capacity, which eventually led to his being offered the full- time post. The department had been affected by the critical reception to many expensive projects such as Rhodes and the departure of senior producers such as Michael Wearing, and many more drama-related producers were reluctant to take the previously highly coveted position. Adams' appointment was not a particularly popular one with the drama staff, as he was seen as more of an administrator than a creative force. He occupied the post for three years, until 2000.

R. Herberger Inc. is a department store chain founded in 1927 with locations throughout the Midwestern United States. The chain was sold in the late 1990s amid growing consolidation in the department store industry, while continuing to operate as a separate nameplate and later sharing a corporate division headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with Carson's, Bergner's and other regional chains by the close of the century. The company's parent company Bon-Ton filed for bankruptcy in 2018 and liquidated.  History  Herberger's previous logo used until January 2004. The store now shares the six-hexagon logo carried by most Bon-Ton divisions. Herberger's began in Osakis, Minnesota, when G.R. \\"Bob\\" Herberger opened his first store in 1927. Herberger's was incorporated for the purpose of acquiring additional stores and expanding into other communities in 1943. By 1972, it grew to 11 stores in four states, with its headquarters in downtown St. Cloud, Minnesota. G. R. Herberger's, Inc., by then an employee-owned company, merged with Proffitt's Inc. in 1997 in stock deal valued at approximately $160 million. As Proffitt's Inc. evolved into Saks Incorporated with the company's acquisition of Saks Fifth Avenue, Herberger's eventually became part of the corporation's Northern Department Store Group, an assortment of store locations initially acquired by Proffitt's Inc. as Carson Pirie Scott & Company. On October 31, 2005, Saks announced that it was selling Herberger's and its other Northern Department Store Group stores (Carson Pirie Scott, Bergner's, Boston Store, and Younkers) to Bon-Ton Stores in a $1.1 billion deal; the transaction was completed on March 6, 2006. Bon-Ton announced on April 17, 2018, that they would be closing doors and began liquidating all 267 stores after two liquidators, Great American Group and Tiger Capital Group, won an auction for the company. The bid was estimated to be worth $775.5 million. This included all remaining Herberger's locations after 91 years of operation. According to national retail reporter Mitch Nolen, stores were closed within 10 to 12 weeks. According to the Fargo INFORUM newspaper, the Herberger's website has returned online with the text \\"Herberger's is coming back\\". According to the article, this coincides with the last location being closed as of August 31. The article did not disclose the financing or ownership of the brand or if the retirement liabilities of former employees remains lost after the transfer of assets. A Herberger's location in Roseville, Minnesota with the old logo. Herberger's was relaunched when CSC Generations purchased Bon Ton, Inc. and their associated brands and customer lists. On October 1, 2018, it was revealed that multiple Herberger's locations would potentially open or reopen around Minnesota, with the first store likely being in Rochester.

The route originates on the state's western border at Columbus in Hickman County, and stretches across the southern portion of the state, terminating southeast of Elkhorn City on the Virginia state line. It is the longest Kentucky State Highway, though the official distance as listed in route logs is much less due to multiple concurrencies with U.S. Route 68 (US 68) and U.S. Route 23. The route was split into two segments from 2003 to November 2009. Construction and relocation of Kentucky Route 80 in Graves, Calloway, and Marshall counties during this time caused the route to be split. A new, four-laned section of Kentucky Route 80 opened in Calloway County on November 25, 2009. The route is now four-lanes from Mayfield to Aurora with plans to complete the four-laning from Aurora to Cadiz over the next few years. Route description =Jackson Purchase region= From Columbus, the road passes through Hickman, Carlisle, and Graves Counties to Mayfield. Before 2003, the road passed through Mayfield and into Marshall County before converging with U.S. Route 68 in Aurora. The two-lane segment of former Kentucky Route 80 from Mayfield to Aurora now has two separate designations. From Mayfield to Brewers in Marshall County, the road retains its former co- designation as Kentucky Route 58. The segment from Brewers to Aurora is now designated as Kentucky Route 402. From Mayfield, Kentucky Route 80 travels along a new four-lane corridor into Calloway County and on to Murray. The route continues through eastern Calloway County and into Marshall County before converging with U.S. Route 68 near the eastern terminus of Kentucky Route 402 in Aurora. =Lake Barkley and Kentucky Lake to Somerset= From Aurora, it follows U.S. Route 68 through Trigg, Christian, Todd, and Logan counties to Bowling Green (Warren County). From Bowling Green through Glasgow to Edmonton, Kentucky Route 80 remains co-joined with US Route 68 serving eastern Warren, Barren and Metcalfe Counties until it goes a little past downtown Edmonton. From Glasgow to Somerset, Kentucky Route 80 is paralleled (and largely supplanted) by the Louie B. Nunn Cumberland Parkway, which is officially designated as the future route of Interstate 66 (I-66), although interest in that project has been lost. Kentucky Route 80 serves rural portions of Barren, Metcalfe (including the city of Edmonton), Adair, Russell, and Casey counties to Somerset (Pulaski County). =Somerset to Hazard= Between Somerset and London (Laurel County), Kentucky Route 80 is again the primary route. The state's I-66 proposals call for Kentucky Route 80 to again be bypassed in this area, with the new road sharing only the crossing over the Rockcastle River gorge. This proposal has met with controversy, with area residents preferring that the new Interstate be built on the existing Kentucky Route 80 right of way. From London to Hazard, Kentucky Route 80 is again supplanted, this time by the former Daniel Boone Parkway, renamed the Hal Rogers Parkway in 2003. Kentucky Route 80 serves rural portions of Clay, Leslie, and Perry counties before rejoining the Parkway near Hazard. =Hazard to Pikeville and the Virginia border= Kentucky Route 80 is a modern four- lane highway (though not controlled access) from Hazard through Knott County to Watergap in Floyd County where it converges with U.S. Route 23. This section of Kentucky Route 80 was completely new construction, with the old highway's segments renamed with several designations, primarily Kentucky Route 550. Kentucky Route 80 continues, concurrent with U.S. Route 460 until reaching Belcher in Pike County and continues into Virginia from Elkhorn City as Virginia State Route 80\\\\. History =Pre-1960s= KY 80's original western terminus was on the east side of Bowling Green during the 1930s and early 1940s. It was extended to its current length, including the concurrency with US 68, in around the late 1940s or early 1950s. Originally, westbound Kentucky Route 80 continued via ferry across the Mississippi River to Belmont, Missouri, where it connected with Missouri Route 80, which traveled west to US 61/US 62 near Sikeston, Missouri. That ferry has long since been discontinued. =Late 20th century realignments= KY 80's original alignments in Knott and Perry Counties were renumbered to KY 550 at some point around 1979‚Äì80. Several other segments of KY 80 were rerouted in various areas between Somerset and Prestonsburg between 1977 and 1984. When the US 68/KY 80 four-lane realignment was completed in the late 1990s, several of the route's old alignments were kept intact, notably in areas between Hopkinsville and Bowling Green. In towns like Fairview, Elkton, Russellville, and Auburn, the old alignments were converted into business routes of US 68. =Rerouting in the Purchase area= The KY 80 alignment from Brewers to Aurora was renumbered as KY 402 at some point during the 2002/03 fiscal year. In the late 2000s, KY 80 was re-routed onto a four-lane highway from Mayfield to Aurora via the northern outskirts of Murray. The segment from US 641 to US 68 was completed in 2006, while the remainder was built during the 2008/09 fiscal year. =Eggners Ferry Bridge collapse of 2012= On January 26, 2012, the Eggner's Ferry Bridge carrying KY 80 and US 68 over Kentucky Lake (Tennessee River) near Aurora collapsed because a cargo ship crashed into one of the bridge's support pillars. The bridge re-opened to traffic in May 2012,{{cite web url= http://www.kentuckyroads.com/news/1515.html title= US 68/KY 80 Kentucky Lake Bridge Reopens work= Kentucky Roads date= May 31, 2012 access-date= January 27, 2013{} but it was replaced by a four-lane bridge that was built more than three years afterwards. A new bridge with similar design over Lake Barkley was completed in 2018 to replace the old bridge there. Major intersections Special routes =Mayfield business route= Kentucky Route 80 Business (KY 80 Bus.) is a business route of KY 80 located in Mayfield, in Graves County. The main alignment of KY 80 has a gap within the city from the Purchase Parkway (Future Interstate 69) interchange to US 45 in downtown Mayfield. KY 80's main alignment resumes beyond the US 45 junction. =Pulaski County connector route= Kentucky Route 80 Connector (KY 80 Conn.) is a roadway in Pulaski County that connects KY 80 with KY 3261. It is located on the west side of Somerset just outside of the city limits. =Somerset business route= Kentucky Route 80 Business (KY 80 Bus.) is a business route of KY 80 located in Somerset, the Pulaski County seat. It begins on the west side of Somerset at KY 80's junction with the KY 914 bypass. It intersects US 27 and KY 1247 in downtown. Its eastern terminus after intersecting KY 912 is at mile point 21.161 of the main route of KY 80 on the east side of Somerset. =Floyd County spur route= Kentucky Route 80 Spur (KY 80S) is a spur route of KY 80 in southern Floyd County. It connects KY 80 with KY 1428 at Martin.

Ivonna Nowicka Her first heart operation was performed in Philadelphia, in 1958, her sea passage on the Polish ocean liner MS Batory, the costs of her stay, and the procedure itself, funded by monies gathered in collection by Polish-Americans, and was successful enough to enable her to live for nine more years. Instead of returning to Poland afterward, she enrolled at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, where she completed her undergraduate studies in 3 years, commencing with no command of the English language whatsoever. Then, turning down an offer of graduate admission with full financial support, extended to her by the faculty of Stanford University's Department of Philosophy, she returned to Poland, where she matriculated in Philosophy at the Jagellonian University, Krak√≥w, and died before continuing on to complete the doctorate, as a 4th year student. She died at 32 after a second heart operation, this time, performed in Poland, to correct an acquired chronic heart defect that limited her mobility and breathing, which befell her due to chronic chill as a 9-year-old child during the World War II German occupation of Poland.

Enlisting on 24 May 1812, he served against the French in Valencia and Catalonia, and retired with the rank of corporal on 8 March 1822. He obtained a minor post in the civil service under the liberal government, and on his discharge determined to earn his living by writing for the stage. This cites: * Marqu√©s de Mol√≠ns, Bret√≥n de los Herreros, recuerdos de su vida y de sus obras (Madrid, 1883) * Obras de Bret√≥n de Herreros (5 vols., Madrid, 1883) * E. Pi√±eyro, El Romanticismo en Espa√±a (Paris, 1904) His first piece, √Å la vejez viruelas, was produced on 4 October 1824, and proved the writer to be the legitimate successor of the younger Morat√≠n. His industry was astonishing: between October 1824 and November 1828, he composed thirty-nine plays, six of them original, the rest being translations or recasts of classic masterpieces. In 1831, he published a translation of Tibullus, and acquired by it an unmerited reputation for scholarship which secured for him an appointment as sub-librarian at the national library. But the theatre claimed him for its own, and with the exception of Elena and a few other pieces in the fashionable romantic vein, his plays were a long series of successes. His only serious check occurred in 1840; the formerly more liberal government had grown conservative, and when in La Ponchada the author ridiculed the National Guard. He was dismissed from the national library, and for a short time was so unpopular that he seriously thought of emigrating to America; but the storm blew over, and within two years Bret√≥n de los Herreros had regained his supremacy on the stage. He became secretary to the Spanish Academy, quarrelled with his fellow-members, and died at Madrid. He is the author of some 360 original plays, twenty-three of which are in prose.

The program emphasizes sound search and a good use of multiple processors. Earlier versions of Zappa are free (though not open-source software) and the current version (Zappa Mexico) is available at Shredder Computer Chess. History Zappa scored an upset victory at the World Computer Chess Championship in August, 2005, in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland where it won with a score of 10 out of 11, and beat both Junior and Shredder, programs that had won the championship many times. In the speed chess portion of the tournament Zappa placed second, after Shredder. Zappa's other tournament successes include winning CCT7 on the Internet Chess Club (ICC) and defeating Grandmaster Jaan Ehlvest 3-1. In Mexico in September 2007 Zappa won a match against Rybka by a score of 5 - 4. Many commentators had predicted a slew of draws based on the strength of the engines, but the differences in style provided an interesting match with several decisive games and many fighting draws. For some time, Zappa was considered one of the two strongest commercially available chess programs; see engine rating lists like CCRLCCRL engine ratings: http://computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/4040/ for current rankings. Some speculate that Zappa's more efficient SMP parallel search could make it stronger on enough processors. In March 2008 Anthony Cozzie announced that \\"the Zappa project is 100% finished\\", which includes both tournaments and future releases. In June 2010, Zach Wegner announced that he had acquired the rights to maintain and improve the Zappa engine. The improved engine competed in the 2010 WCCC under the name Rondo, achieving second place behind Rybka before the latter's disqualification.Rybka placed first but the program was found to have plagiarized Crafty and Fruit(the GPL'ed runner-up in 2005), and was stripped of its title. ()  Commercialization  Immediately after the successful WCCC 2005, there were plans to commercialize Zappa, but the first attempts with Vincent Diepeveen failed. In April 2006, a commercial version dubbed Zap!Chess running under the Fritz GUI was released by ChessBase. The version of Zappa that won the Zappa-Rybka match, Zappa Mexico, is sold by Shredder Computer Chess, is compatible with Windows and Linux computers with up to 512 CPU cores and supports multipv analysis and Nalimov tablebases.

The WCL changed its name prior to the 1980 season and has been known since as the South Atlantic League, a highly successful low Class A circuit with teams up the Eastern Seaboard from Georgia to New Jersey. Originally called the \\"Western Carolina League\\", the 1948‚Äì52 WCL was composed exclusively of teams located in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge sections of western North Carolina. It merged with the North Carolina State League to form the short-lived Class D Tar Heel League, which lasted only 1¬Ω seasons (1953‚Äì54) before folding. In 1960, the WCL was revived as a Class D circuit intended to house farm teams of the member clubs of a planned third major league, the Continental League. It featured teams in eight North Carolina locales: Gastonia, Hickory, Lexington, Newton-Conover, Rutherford County, Salisbury, Shelby and Statesville, but soon expanded to sites in South Carolina. When the Continental League was torpedoed by the Major League Baseball expansion in and , the member teams of the Western Carolinas League became affiliates of American and National League clubs. It was upgraded to Class A in the 1963 reorganization of the minor leagues.

It is located to the north and northeast of the city of Wilmington. Hundreds were once used as a basis for representation in the Delaware General Assembly. Brandywine Hundred and North Wilmington are commonly used colloquial names for this area. However, while their names still appear on all real estate transactions, all other hundreds in Delaware presently have no meaningful use or purpose except as a geographical point of reference. In the 2010 census, Brandywine had 77,182 people.  Grubb's Landing  Brandywine Hundred, also known as Grubb's Landing, was settled by two sons of John Grubb (1652-1708) -- Emanuel Grubb and John Grubb II (1684-1757). Boundaries and formation Brandywine Hundred is that portion of New Castle County that lies north of the Christina River and east of Brandywine Creek, excepting that portion in the south included in Wilmington Hundred. Its northern boundary follows a portion of the 12 mile arc drawn around the town of New Castle. It was one of the original hundreds in Delaware created in 1682 and was named for Brandywine Creek that flows along its western boundary. When created it included some of the area now in the Wilmington Hundred, which was split off 1833. Development Excepting a still wooded area along Brandywine Creek, the area is completely suburban with almost continuous industrial, commercial and residential development. The eastern portion was built out early in the twentieth century with the remainder in the decades following World War II. The town of Bellefonte, the villages of Arden, Ardencroft, and Ardentown, the Claymont and Edgemoor Census Designated Places (CDP), and the community of Talleyville are in Brandywine Hundred. Geography Important geographical features, in addition to the Christina River and Brandywine Creek, include the Delaware River, which forms its eastern boundary, Naaman's Creek and Shellpot Creek. It is mostly in the piedmont region with one of the more dramatic sections of the Fall Line being close enough to the Delaware River to allow many scenic views. Ebright Azimuth, the highest natural elevation in the state at (, is located along the northern edge of Brandywine Hundred, very close to the Pennsylvania line. Transportation Important roads include portions of Interstate 95, Interstate 495, Concord Pike (U.S. Route 202), Powder Mill Road (Delaware Route 141), Naamans Road and Thompson Bridge Road (Delaware Route 92), Marsh Road (Delaware Route 3), Foulk Road (Delaware Route 261), Delaware Route 491, and the old main highway between Wilmington and Philadelphia, now Philadelphia Pike (U.S. Route 13). A portion of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, subsequently the main north-south line of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and now Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, follows the Delaware River, and a portion of the old Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, now CSX Transportation's Philadelphia Subdivision, approximately follows the Fall Line. In media Mitchell Hundred, the fictional mayor of New York City and central protagonist of Brian K.

Life Crawford was the son of Sir Alexander Lindsay of Glenesk and Katherine Stirling. Succeeding his father in 1381, he was known until his elevation to the peerage as Sir David Lindsay of Glenesk. He was also the 10th baron of Crawford, Lanarkshire. In 1398, his father-in-law Robert II gave him the title of earl, along with Crawford Castle. Many historians believe that Lindsay was also the organiser for the Battle of the Clans at Perth in 1396. Additionally, Lindsay was a noted jousting champion who fought the English champion Lord Welles in a remarkable duel on St. George's Day 1390. In the duel, Lindsay unhorsed Welles so easily that the crowd began yelling that he had nailed himself to his saddle. To prove he had not, Lindsay jumped off his horse and then back on, while still wearing his full suit of armour. After he realized Welles was wounded he rushed to his aid and helped him to a nearby hospital. He visited Welles every day while he was recovering and they became good friends. Lord Crawford died at Finavon Castle in 1407 and was buried at the church of the Greyfriars at Dundee.James Balfour Paul, Scots Peerage, vol iii, p. 17.

The system flexibility allows SATMODE to be used in extreme scenarios by adjusting the modem parameters: * Very power limited scenarios (it‚Äôs the case for most VSAT Ku-band satellites) * Aggressive multi-beam satellite space segment allowing to increase the return channel speed for a given translit power To reach the flexibility goal and nevertheless keep full interoperatibility of terminals, SATMODE uses a fully specified waveform toolbox. The choice of constant envelope modulations is made to minimize the terminal cost. Thanks to this property, very low cost outdoor units (ODUs) operating at full saturation and in non-linear mode can be used. Moderate bit rates allow to use very low power transmitters (typically 100 mW), keeping the cost compatible with the mass-market. The selected access scheme -- slotted ALOHA -- is efficient on iTV traffic and very easy to scale up to a very high number of terminals only sending a few packets from time to time. The building blocks of the SATMODE toolbox are: * Binary or quaternary CPM * Programmable phase filter for CPM modulations (GMSK being a specific case) * Flexible Turbo or Turbo-like * Programmable interleavers (3) * Programmable constituent codes with bypass possibilities (2) * Programmable Unique Word structure * Tables extraction from a DVB TS (DVB-S or DVB-S2 broadcast) All the parameters are sent by the HUB through DVB tables, even allowing changes during operation: * FCT: Sprectrum organisation in Carrier Groups * FAT: Spectrum Allocation to services Signalisation information sent to specific terminals is also embedded in DVB tables (SMT tables). The terminal is fully defined: it must be able to play the complete waveform space. The HUB is in the ground station. The HUB usually only implements one scheme and sends the tables to the terminals to instruct them to play that scheme. SATMODE Project The SATMODE development project has been funded at 50% by ESA.

Early life  Gloeckner was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her mother was a librarian and her father, David Gloeckner, was a commercial illustrator. Her father's family was Quaker and she attended Quaker schools when she was young. She has a younger sister. Gloeckner's parents divorced when she was 4 years old. In 1972, when she was 11 or 12 years old, her mother remarried and the family moved to San Francisco. She attended several Bay Area schools, including The Urban School of San Francisco and Lick-Wilmerding High School. She was a boarding student at Castilleja (in Palo Alto) for a year, but returned to San Francisco to live with her mother, her mother's boyfriend, and her sister, when she was 14. Gloeckner began cartooning at the age of 12. Because her mother was dating Robert Armstrong, a cartoonist in Robert Crumb's band Cheap Suit Serenaders, she met many San Francisco underground comics figures who had a profound influence upon her, including Robert Crumb, Aline Kominsky, Bill Griffith, Terry Zwigoff, and Diane Noomin. Gloeckner attended San Francisco State University from 1980 to 1985, where she was a pre-med student and studied French and art. She spent the 1983‚Äì1984 academic year in Universit√© d‚ÄôAix- Marseille studying art, French, and biology, and from 1984 to 1985 spent about six months studying Czech and literature at Charles University in Prague. She has an M.A. in Biomedical Communications from University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, which she received in 1988. The degree was in medical illustration. Her 1987 dissertation was on the \\"Semiotic Analysis of Medical Illustration,\\" in which she studies narrative devices used in medical and surgical illustration. Gloeckner became interested in medical illustration through her maternal grandfather, an antique dealer who collected and sold old books, and her paternal grandmother, Dr. Louise Carpenter Gloeckner, who was a physician in Philadelphia and was the first woman to be elected vice president of the American Medical Association.  Career  Gloeckner worked prolifically as a medical illustrator since 1988, and her training is evident in her paintings and comics art, which are highly detailed and often prominently feature the human body. Her first prominent work in fiction publishing, a series of illustrations for the RE/Search edition of J. G. Ballard's novel The Atrocity Exhibition, used clinical images of internal anatomy, sex, and physical trauma in ambiguous and evocative combinations. Her early comics work, in the form of short stories published in a variety of underground anthologies including Wimmen's Comix, Weirdo, Young Lust, and Twisted Sisters, and in the tabloid zine, RE/Search (numbered volumes), was sporadic and rarely seen until the 1998 release of the collection A Child's Life and Other Stories. This was followed by her 2002 graphic novel The Diary of a Teenage Girl: An Account in Words and Pictures, which revisited the troubled life of the young character (usually referred to as \\"Minnie Goetze\\") previously featured in some of her comics, this time in an unusual combination of prose, illustration, and short comics scenes. Her novel and many of her short stories are semi-autobiographical, a frequent cause of comment due to their depiction of sex, drug use, and childhood traumas; however, Gloeckner has stated that she regards them as fiction. Sexual content led to A Child's Life and Other Stories being banned from the public library in Stockton, California, after it was checked out by an 11-year-old reader. The mayor of Stockton called the book \\"a how-to book for pedophiles.\\" The graphic novel was also classified as pornography and refused entry by customs officials in both France and England. Less controversial, and actually intended for children, is the book Weird Things You Can Grow, published by Random House, and books in the series beginning with Tales Too Funny to be True published by HarperCollins, for which she did the illustrations. A film version of The Diary of a Teenage Girl premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. The film was acquired by Sony Pictures Classics at the festival. Adapted and directed by Marielle Heller, it is based on Heller's earlier stage adaptation. The film stars Alexander Skarsg√•rd as Monroe, Kristen Wiig as Charlotte, and Bel Powley as the main character, Minnie Goetze. Heller developed the script at the Sundance Institute's Sundance Feature Film Program Lab. The film won \\"Best First Feature\\" at the 2016 Spirit Awards.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/diary-a-teenage-girl-wins-869784 Gloeckner briefly taught courses at Suffolk Community College and Stony Brook University. Gloeckner is an associate professor at the University of Michigan Stamps School of Art & Design, a position she has held since 2010. In recognition of her contributions to the comic art form, Comics Alliance listed Gloeckner as one of twelve women cartoonists deserving of lifetime achievement recognition.  Personal life  In 1986, Gloeckner married Czech artist Jakub Kalousek. They later divorced. She has two daughters, Audrey \\"Fina\\" Gloeckner- Kalousek and Persephone Gloeckner-Kalousek.

Typical nucleoproteins include ribosomes, nucleosomes and viral nucleocapsid proteins.  Structures  Cross-sectional drawing of the Ebola virus particle, with structures of the major proteins shown and labelled on the right Nucleoproteins tend to be positively charged, facilitating interaction with the negatively charged nucleic acid chains. The tertiary structures and biological functions of many nucleoproteins are understood.Graeme K. Hunter G. K. (2000): Vital Forces. The discovery of the molecular basis of life. Academic Press, London 2000, .Nelson D. L., Cox M. M. (2013): Lehninger Biochemie. Springer, . Important techniques for determining the structures of nucleoproteins include X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy. = Viruses = Virus genomes (either DNA or RNA) are extremely tightly packed into the viral capsid. Many viruses are therefore little more than an organised collection of nucleoproteins with their binding sites pointing inwards. Structurally characterised viral nucleoproteins include influenza, rabies, Ebola, Bunyamwera, Schmallenberg, Hazara, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Lassa.  Deoxyribonucleoproteins  A deoxyribonucleoprotein (DNP) is a complex of DNA and protein. The prototypical examples are nucleosomes, complexes in which genomic DNA is wrapped around clusters of eight histone proteins in eukaryotic cell nuclei to form chromatin. Protamines replace histones during spermatogenesis. = Functions = The most widespread deoxyribonucleoproteins are nucleosomes, in which the component is nuclear DNA. The proteins combined with DNA are histones and protamines; the resulting nucleoproteins are located in chromosomes. Thus, the entire chromosome, i.e. chromatin in eukaryotes consists of such nucleoproteins.Nelson D. L., Michael M. Cox M. M. (2013): Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman, . In eukaryotic cells, DNA is associated with about an equal mass of histone proteins in a highly condensed nucleoprotein complex called chromatin. Deoxyribonucleoproteins in this kind of complex interact to generate a multiprotein regulatory complex in which the intervening DNA is looped or wound. The deoxyribonucleoproteins participate in regulating DNA replication and transcription. Deoxyribonucleoproteins are also involved in homologous recombination, a process for repairing DNA that appears to be nearly universal. A central intermediate step in this process is the interaction of multiple copies of a recombinase protein with single-stranded DNA to form a DNP filament. Recombinases employed in this process are produced by archaea (RadA recombinase), by bacteria (RecA recombinase) and by eukaryotes from yeast to humans (Rad51 and Dmc1 recombinases).  Ribonucleoproteins  Cell nucleus with DNA stained blue, and nucleolin protein in red. The nucleolin protein binds some mRNAs (e.g. mRNA for Interleukin-6). This protects those mRNAs from degradation by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus when infected. This RNA-nucleolin complex is then safely transported to the cytosol for translation by ribosomes to produce the Interleukin-6 protein, which is involved in antiviral immune response.A ribonucleoprotein (RNP) is a complex of ribonucleic acid and RNA-binding protein. These complexes play an integral part in a number of important biological functions that include transcription, translation and regulating gene expression and regulating the metabolism of RNA. A few examples of RNPs include the ribosome, the enzyme telomerase, vault ribonucleoproteins, RNase P, hnRNP and small nuclear RNPs (snRNPs), which have been implicated in pre-mRNA splicing (spliceosome) and are among the main components of the nucleolus. Some viruses are simple ribonucleoproteins, containing only one molecule of RNA and a number of identical protein molecules. Others are ribonucleoprotein or deoxyribonucleoprotein complexes containing a number of different proteins, and exceptionally more nucleic acid molecules. Currently, over 2000 RNPs can be found in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). Furthermore, the Protein-RNA Interface Data Base (PRIDB) possesses a collection of information on RNA-protein interfaces based on data drawn from the PDB. Some common features of protein-RNA interfaces were deduced based on known structures. For example, RNP in snRNPs have an RNA-binding motif in its RNA-binding protein. Aromatic amino acid residues in this motif result in stacking interactions with RNA. Lysine residues in the helical portion of RNA- binding proteins help to stabilize interactions with nucleic acids. This nucleic acid binding is strengthened by electrostatic attraction between the positive lysine side chains and the negative nucleic acid phosphate backbones. Additionally, it is possible to model RNPs computationally. Although computational methods of deducing RNP structures are less accurate than experimental methods, they provide a rough model of the structure which allows for predictions of the identity of significant amino acids and nucleotide residues. Such information helps in understanding the overall function the RNP.ribonucleoprotein particle proteins, stained white, hijack active transport via the endosomes to move more rapidly within the cell than by simple diffusion. 'RNP' can also refer to ribonucleoprotein particles. Ribonucleoprotein particles are distinct intracellular foci for post- transcriptional regulation. These particles play an important role in influenza A virus replication. The influenza viral genome is composed of eight ribonucleoprotein particles formed by a complex of negative-sense RNA bound to a viral nucleoprotein. Each RNP carries with it an RNA polymerase complex. When the nucleoprotein binds to the viral RNA, it is able to expose the nucleotide bases which allow the viral polymerase to transcribe RNA. At this point, once the virus enters a host cell it will be prepared to begin the process of replication. = Anti-RNP antibodies = Anti-RNP antibodies are autoantibodies associated with mixed connective tissue disease and are also detected in nearly 40% of Lupus erythematosus patients. Two types of anti-RNP antibodies are closely related to Sj√∂gren's syndrome: SS-A (Ro) and SS-B (La). Autoantibodies against snRNP are called Anti-Smith antibodies and are specific for SLE. The presence of a significant level of anti-U1-RNP also serves a possible indicator of MCTD when detected in conjunction with several other factors. = Functions = The ribonucleoproteins play a role of protection. mRNAs never occur as free RNA molecules in the cell. They always associate with ribonucleoproteins and function as ribonucleoprotein complexes. In the same way, the genomes of negative-strand RNA viruses never exist as free RNA molecule. The ribonucleoproteins protect their genomes from RNase. Nucleoproteins are often the major antigens for viruses because they have strain-specific and group-specific antigenic determinants.

Typically, the leading edge also sweeps forward. Characteristics The forward-swept configuration has a number of characteristics which increase as the angle of sweep increases. =Main spar location= The rearward location of the main wing spar would lead to a more efficient interior arrangement with more usable space. =Inward spanwise flow= Spanwise airflow over a forward- swept wing is the reverse of flow over a conventional swept wing. Air flowing over any swept wing tends to move spanwise towards the rearmost end of the wing. On a rearward-swept wing this is outwards towards the tip, while on a forward-swept wing it is inwards towards the root. As a result, the dangerous tip stall condition of a rearward-swept design becomes a safer and more controllable root stall on a forward-swept design. This allows full aileron control despite loss of lift, and also means that drag-inducing leading edge slots or other devices are not required. With the air flowing inwards, wingtip vortices and the accompanying drag are reduced. Instead, the fuselage acts as a very large wing fence and, since wings are generally larger at the root, this raises the maximum lift coefficient allowing a smaller wing. As a result, maneuverability is improved, especially at high angles of attack. At transonic speeds, shockwaves build up first at the root rather than the tip, again helping ensure effective aileron control. =Yaw instability= One problem with the forward-swept design is that when a swept wing yaws sideways (moves about its horizontal axis), one wing retreats while the other advances. On a forward-swept design, this reduces the sweep of the rearward wing, increasing its drag and pushing it further back, increasing the amount of yaw and leading to directional instability. This can lead to a Dutch roll in reverse.Miller, J.; The X-Planes, Speciality Press, Second Printing (1985), Pages 175-177. =Aeroelasticity= One of the drawbacks of forward swept wings is the increased chance of divergence, an aeroelastic consequence of lift force on forward swept wings twisting the tip upwards under increased lift. On a forward-swept design, this causes a positive feedback loop that increases the angle of incidence at the tip, increasing lift and inducing further deflection, resulting in yet more lift and additional changes in wing shape. The effect of divergence increases with speed. The maximum safe speed below which this does not happen is the divergence speed of the aircraft. Such an increase in tip lift under load causes the wing to tighten into turns and may result in a spiral dive from which recovery is not possible. In the worst case, the wing structure can be stressed to the point of failure. At large angles of sweep and high speeds, in order to build a structure stiff enough to resist deforming yet light enough to be practicable, advanced materials such as carbon fiber composites are required. Composites also allow aeroelastic tailoring by aligning fibers to influence the nature of deformation to a more favorable shape, impacting stall and other characteristics. =Stall characteristics= Any swept wing tends to be unstable in the stall, since the rearward end stalls first causing a pitch-up force worsening the stall and making recovery difficult. This effect is more significant with forward sweep because the rearward end is the root and carries greater lift. However, if the aeroelastic bending is sufficient, it can counteract this tendency by increasing the angle of attack at the wing tips to such an extent that the tips stall first and one of the main characteristics of the design is lost. Such a tip stall can be unpredictable, especially where one tip stalls before the other. Composite materials allow aeroelastic tailoring, so that as the wing approaches the stall it twists as it bends, so as to reduce the angle of attack at the tips. This ensures that the stall occurs at the wing root, making it more predictable and allowing the ailerons to retain full control. History =Prewar studies= Belyaev, the author of the below mentioned DB-LK project, tested forward-swept wing gliders BP-2 and BP-3 in 1934 and 1935. http://www.airwar.ru/enc/glider/bp2.htmlhttp://www.k2x2.info/transport_i_aviacija/aviacija_i_vremja_2008_04/p9.php Other prewar design studies included the Polish PWS Z-17, Z-18 and Z-47 \\"Sƒôp\\" series. =World War II and aftermath= Forward-swept wings designs, some whose design had begun during the prewar period, were developed during the Second World War, independently in Germany, Russia, Japan, and the US. An early example to fly, in 1940, was the Belyayev DB-LK, a twin-boom design with forward-swept outer wing sections and backwards-swept tips. It reportedly flew well. Belyayev's proposed Babochka research aircraft was cancelled following the German invasion. The American Cornelius Mallard flew on 18 August 1943. The Mallard was powered by a single engine, but it was followed by the Cornelius XFG-1 prototypes, which were flying fuel tanks, unpowered and designed for towing by larger aircraft. These Cornelius designs were unusual for being not only forward swept but also tailless. A model of the Ju 287 V1 Meanwhile in Germany, Hans Wocke was studying the problems of swept wings at the near-sonic speeds of which the new jet engines were capable. He recognised many of the advantages that forward sweep offered over the backwards-swept designs then being developed, and also understood the implications of aeroelastic bending and yaw instability. His first such design to fly was the Junkers Ju 287, on 16 August 1944. Flight tests on this and later variants confirmed the low-speed advantages but also soon revealed the expected problems, preventing high-speed trials. Wocke and the incomplete Ju 287 V3 prototype were captured and, in 1946, taken to Moscow where the aircraft was completed and flown the next year as the OKB-1 EF 131. The later OKB-1 EF 140 was essentially the same airframe re-engined with a pair of Mikulin-design Soviet jet engines of greater thrust. In 1948 the Soviet Union created the Tsybin's LL-3.Russian Aviation Page: Sukhoi S-37 Berkut (S-32) The prototype would subsequently have a great impact on the Sukhoi's SYB-A, which was completed in 1982. When the German research reached the United States after the war, a number of proposals were put forward. These included the Convair XB-53 supersonic bomber and forward-swept variants of the North American P-51 Mustang, Bell X-1 rocket plane and Douglas D-558-I. The Bell proposal reached the wind tunnel testing stage, where the problems of aeroelasticity were confirmed. The structural problems confirmed by the Ju 287 series and the Bell X-1 studies proved so severe that the materials available at the time could not make a wing strong and stiff enough without also making it too heavy to be practical. As a result, forward sweep for high-speed designs was abandoned, until many years later new structural materials would become available. Throughout World War II, numerous fighter, bomber, and other military aircraft can be described as having forward-swept wings, due to the average chord of their wings being forward-sweeping. However, these designs almost always utilized a rearward-swept leading edge, which would technically render them as high aspect ratio trapezoidal wings. The Nakajima Ki-43 is notable for being the only successful fighter aircraft with a truly forward-swept wing, although the forward sweep of its leading edge is nearly unnoticeable. =Postwar general aviation= LET L-13 two-seat glider ARV Super2 Small amounts of sweep do not cause serious problems and even moderate forward sweep allows a significant aft movement of the main spar attachment point and carry-through structure. In 1954 Wocke returned to the German Democratic Republic, moving to West Germany shortly afterwards and joining Hamburger Flugzeugbau (HFB) as their chief designer. In Hamburg, Wocke completed work on the HFB 320 Hansa Jet business jet which flew in 1964. The forward sweep enabled the main spar to be moved aft behind the cabin so that the spar did not need to project into the cabin. Moderate forward sweep has been used for similar reasons in many designs, mainly sailplanes and light aircraft. Many high-wing training gliders with two seats in tandem have slightly forward-swept wings in order to enable the wing root to be located further aft to prevent the wing from obscuring the rear occupant's lateral visibility. Typical examples are the Schleicher ASK 13 and the Let Kunovice LET L-13 Blan√≠k. Other examples include: * Cessna NGP, a prototype single-engine aircraft intended to eventually replace the Cessna 172 and Cessna 182. * CZAW ParrotCZAW web site * Saab Safari, B√∂lkow Junior & ARV Super2 all have shoulder wings for increased visibility, necessitating forward-swept wings to maintain correct CofG. * Scaled Composites Boomerang, a prototype piston twin design which would allow for safe handling in the event of a single engine failure. * SZD-9 Bocian and PZL Bielsko SZD-50 Puchacz, multi-purpose two-seat sailplanes designed and built in Poland. =Return of the fast jet= Grumman X-29 displaying forward-swept wing configuration KB SAT SR-10 trainer The large angles of sweep necessary for high-speed flight remained impractical for many years. In the late 1970s, DARPA began investigating the use of newer composite materials to avoid the problem of reduced divergence speed through aeroelastic tailoring. Fly-by-wire technology allowed for the design to be dynamically unstable and improved maneuverability. Grumman built two X-29 technology demonstrators, first flying in 1984, with forward swept wings and canards. Maneuverable at high angles of attack, the X-29 remained controllable at 67¬∞ angle of attack.NASA. \\"Dryden Fact Sheet - X-29\\". Retrieved 22 August 2005. Advances in thrust vectoring technology and a shift in air combat tactics toward medium range missile engagements decreased the relevance of a highly agile fighter aircraft. In 1997, Sukhoi introduced the Su-47 fighter prototype at the Paris Air Show. It had not entered production, although it underwent a series of flight tests and performed at several air shows. KB SAT SR-10 is a prototype Russian single- engine jet trainer aircraft, fitted with forward-swept wings. It first flew in 2015.

The Sons of the Most Holy Redeemer monastery can be seen in the top right, and the Point of the Graand in the bottom right The Congregation of the Sons of the Most Holy Redeemer (; siglum: F.SS.R.), commonly known as the Transalpine Redemptorists or The Sons, are a religious institute of the Catholic Church canonically erected in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Aberdeen and based on Papa Stronsay in the Orkney Islands, Scotland, as well as in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand. They were formed in 1988 as a traditionalist offshoot of the Redemptorists, following a monastic rule based on that of St. Alphonsus Liguori, and was later formally erected as a religious institute in 2012. History The congregation was founded as the Transalpine Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer (C.SS.R.) on 2 August 1988 by the Redemptorist priest Father Michael Mary Sim C.SS.R. as a traditionalist Redemptorist religious community affiliated with the Society of Saint Pius X, and were called the Transalpine Redemptorists. Originally based at the Monastery of the Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, they moved to the Mother of Perpetual Succour Monastery in Joinville, Haute-Marne, France, in 1994, until they bought the island of Papa Stronsay on 31 May 1999. There they established the Golgotha Monastery, and have published The Catholic monthly since 1982. They promote a Redemptorist Purgatorian Confraternity. In July 2007 the institute established a second monastery in Christchurch, New Zealand. In June 2008, the community petitioned the Holy See for reconciliation and this was accepted by Pope Benedict XVI who declared them to be in \\"canonical good standing\\" within the Catholic Church. The motu proprio Summorum Pontificum was the main incentive which caused the community to reconsider their position. Most of the members accepted the move, while a remnant continue to be affiliated with the SSPX. They changed their official name to The Sons of the Most Holy Redeemer (F.SS.R.), and made alterations to their religious habit in order to more clearly differentiate themselves from that of the Redemptorists. However, they were not canonically established as a religious institute and thus their faculties for celebrating Mass were for some years restricted to the islands of Papa Stronsay and Stronsay. On 15 August 2012, the community of fifteen was granted canonical recognition as a Clerical Institute of Diocesan Right by Dom Hugh Gilbert, O.S.B., Bishop of Aberdeen. In June 2013, the congregation celebrated the ordination in Rome of two of its members.

The telethon benefits a wide range of children's charities throughout Kentucky and southern Indiana. The Crusade was begun in 1954, in large part through the efforts of Barry Bingham, Sr., the patriarch of the family that owned the stations and The Courier- Journal newspaper together. (WHAS-TV is currently under the ownership of Tegna, Inc.‚Äîspun off in 2015 from Gannett Company, which still owns the Courier-Journal ‚Äî while WHAS Radio is now owned by iHeartMedia) The first telethon was telecast from the Memorial Auditorium, and featured actor Pat O'Brien as the celebrity guest. Contributions on the first telethon totaled more than $156,000. The 2020 telethon, the 67th of the series, raised $4,800,000; the total was rounded upward to an even amount thanks to what has become an annual tradition, an additional gift from the family foundation of the late Louisville automobile dealer Sam Swope. The 2020 total was down significantly from the record total of $5,690,000 the previous year, a decrease attributed in large part to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The total does not include bequests, which go into a special endowment set up in 2004 that is used to pay the expenses of the Crusade organization so that 100 percent of all monies collected by the public go directly to children's special needs, a practice that the Crusade promotes in many of its promotions. The record tote board total for the Crusade, not including bequests, was more than $6 million (2004, the 50th edition). Since its founding, the Crusade has raised more than $180 million for local children's special needs. The Crusade has become a major local institution. For months before the telethon broadcast each June, grass-roots collection efforts are held throughout the area‚Äîfrom \\"pickle jars\\" at restaurants, to bingo games, to benefit concerts and hundreds of similar events. In the early days of television, local telethons were quite common. In recent years, most local telethons gave way to well-produced national telethons such as the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon, but many of those have since fallen by the wayside while the Crusade rolls on. The Crusade for Children may be an anachronism, but a hugely successful one. It is by far the most successful local telethon in America, by almost any measure, though its outreach has grown well past the Louisville metro area. It is second in longevity only to a local telethon in Green Bay, Wisconsin on WBAY-TV that benefits those with cerebral palsy; that telethon was first produced in March 1954, seven months before the first Crusade for Children. The Crusade broadcast is normally held on the first weekend of June each year, beginning on Saturday afternoon and ending sometime on Sunday night (in past years, it occasionally even into the wee hours of Monday). In 2019, the Crusade broadcast dates were June 21‚Äì2. In 2020, the Crusade was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic to August 8‚Äì9, with most of the broadcast done in large or outdoor venues to facilitate social distancing. The firefighters Fire Departments are preparing to go on-air with the WHAS Crusade for Children; this one is the Highview, Kentucky Fire Dept. The backbone of the collection efforts, and the signature of the Crusade itself, are the dozens of local fire departments who collect millions of dollars each year. Most of those donations come at road blocks set up at hundreds of intersections throughout the region, where firefighters ask motorists to put donations in boots. On a Saturday or Sunday in late spring, it's not uncommon for someone driving across metro Louisville to encounter multiple road blocks manned by volunteers. During the telethon, each fire department brings in those donations, dumping them out of the boots and into \\"fishbowls\\" (aquarium-like containers) before the cameras. Before the \\"dump,\\" a representative from each department usually reads a list of significant contributors, businesses who helped the department during fund-raising efforts, and numerous others who helped in any way, a process which can be lengthy. Crusade organizers have tried to streamline the process of the years in the same way awards shows have attempted to reduce acceptance speeches to reduce time, to mixed results. In the past, the fire departments brought the collections directly to the television studio, parading their trucks down the street outside with sirens blaring. But the number of participating departments has become so large that in recent years, remote broadcasts are set up in outlying communities such as Elizabethtown, Corydon and elsewhere, which also allows those fire departments to keep their equipment and trucks in their areas to allow emergency deployment. The increase in fire department donations forced the Crusade to broadcast a pre-telethon show, featuring the departmental reports and remotes from across the area. In 2007, Crusade organizers simply moved the official start of the broadcast to 1:30 p.m. local time, with a one-hour break for local and network newscasts. The 2008 Crusade followed a similar schedule, except for a two-hour break Saturday afternoon for the ABC broadcast of the 2008 Belmont Stakes; the telethon broadcast its final total during halftime of Sunday night's ABC broadcast of Game 2 of the 2008 NBA Finals. In 2011 the Crusade ended at 6:30 p.m., in order to clear the 2011 NBA Finals, the earliest on-air finish in many years; since then, the telethon has ended at or near the same time, mainly because of the NBA Finals commitment. Departments compete each year to win the Jim Walton Trophy, given to departments that record the largest percentage increase in donations from the previous year. The trophy is named for Jim Walton, a WHAS-TV personality who was the Crusade's master of ceremonies for 26 years, and was its first executive director. Fire department collections typically account for more than half of the Crusade's final total each year. On-air performers Almost every Crusade features a celebrity guest, who usually performs on Saturday night during a variety-show segment that leads off the traditional Crusade telecast. In 2006, Peabo Bryson made his second appearance as the headline guest, and returned for his third in 2013. In 2007, The Kentucky Headhunters‚Äîwhose origins are in Edmonton, Kentucky‚Äîare the headliners. Other past guests have included magicians Lance Burton and Mac King (two Las Vegas headliners with roots in Louisville), Kenny Rogers, Lee Greenwood, Steve Wariner, Ricky Skaggs, Tammy Wynette, Alan Thicke, Bobby Goldsboro, B. J. Thomas, Florence Henderson, Diahann Carroll, McLean Stevenson, Merv Griffin, Eydie Gorme, and Cab Calloway. Larnelle Harris, a popular Gospel singer and Louisville resident, has appeared on many Crusade telecasts. Other local artists with multiple Crusade appearances include Melissa Combs, JoAnn Hale, Judy Marshall, Karen Kraft and Kiks, The Monarchs, and Louisville's Thoroughbred Chorus, a world champion men's barbershop chorus. Mel Owen directed the Crusade Orchestra for many decades. WHAS radio and television personality Terry Meiners and WHAS-TV news anchor Melissa Swan are the co- hosts of the Crusade telecast. WHAS radio and television host Milton Metz is one of a handful of people who have been involved with every Crusade since the inaugural event; he appeared on every Crusade until his death in 2016. The Crusade broadcast goes on through Saturday night and Sunday morning, as is traditional with most telethons, but much of the overnight portion of the show consists of segments taped beforehand. Broadcast/Webcast outlets In recent years, all or portions of the Crusade have been telecast by stations other than WHAS television and radio. In 2007, television stations in Bowling Green (WBKO), Lexington (WKYT), Paducah (WQTV/WQWQ) and Hazard (WYMT-TV) carried portions of the broadcast, as well as sister station (WBKI-TV) in Louisville. Starting in 2010, WBKO has carried remote broadcasts of its own from locations in south Central Kentucky. On radio, stations from the Commonwealth Broadcasting Company group carried the telecast in Bowling Green, Glasgow, Bardstown, Campbellsville, Princeton, Madisonville and Elizabethtown. The Crusade is also webcast via the WHAS-TV website. Where the money goes Throughout the year, various agencies throughout Kentucky and southern Indiana apply for grants from the Crusade. These applications are considered and grants made by the Crusade Advisory Panel, a group of local clergy. This task was originally administered by the panel of The Moral Side of the News, a long-running public affairs program on WHAS-TV and Radio where local clergy discuss current events. (The program remains one of the longest-running continually aired broadcasts of any kind in radio history.) In later years, the panel's Crusade duties grew larger than the program, hence the name change in recent years; additionally, other members outside of the show have been added to the panel, so that the Moral Side panel members are now a subset of the Crusade Advisory Panel. Grants are made in all 120 Kentucky counties and in 50 Indiana counties. The Crusade returns donations from a certain area to that area‚Äîfor instance, donations from Hardin County will be assigned to grant requests from that county. This has been Crusade policy since the beginning. All grants are on an annual basis; thus, charities must reapply each year. Grant requests typically total about three times the amount collected. The Crusade prides itself in the fact that 100% of all donations go directly to grants, a fact particularly emphasized in its 2011 campaign and later. All overhead costs of the Crusade organization are covered by donations from businesses, and more recently from proceeds of an endowment set up for that purpose. During the years of Bingham family ownership of WHAS, the stations and the family covered many of such costs themselves. Former Jefferson County Judge-Executive Rebecca Jackson was named the Crusade's executive director in 2005. Jackson was the first Crusade director to come from outside the WHAS corporate organization. She replaced Dan Miller, a longtime WHAS-TV employee who left in 2004 to become vice president at Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky. Jackson retired at the end of 2008. Dawn Dison Lee became the new Crusade director in February 2009. Charges against chairman In 2010, an indictment was brought against Paul Barth, chairman of the Crusade's board of directors and then chief of the McMahan Fire Protection District volunteer fire department. The charges accused Barth of federal mail fraud, money laundering and embezzlement, among other charges. Barth was accused of embezzling at least $189,000 from the Crusade. Barth faced trial in October 2011, Barth pleaded guilty to 15 felony counts in June 2012. As part of a plea bargain agreement, the court ordered him to pay full restitution to the WHAS Crusade for Children and sentenced him to 41 months in federal prison without any possibility of an early parole.Paul Barth Receives Prison Time for Thefts As a result of the incident, tighter controls have been placed on money as it comes in to the Crusade. Money is placed in secure money bags by firefighters, and is deposited on arrival at the studio or remote broadcast location. The traditional pouring of money from boots and buckets into fishbowls during the broadcast now is merely a prop utilizing a smaller amount of money for show, with the contributed amount pre-counted and revealed at that time.

The school was not ready in 1908, but was opened early due to overcrowding. It was finished on February 6, 1910. The Oregonian reported in January 1922 that Jefferson was the largest high school in Portland, with 2,063 students. Hopkin Jenkins was principal at Jefferson from its opening until June 1940. Due to the baby boom and passing of a $25 million building levy by the school district in 1947, a new high school was slated. In September 1991, \\"at least six fires\\" were set at the school by an arsonist. On January 7, 2008, Mayor Potter relocated City Hall to Jefferson for a week. Potter held a City Council meeting and delivered the State of the City address there.

In 2009, 18% of students transferred into the school. In 2008, 67% of the school's seniors received a high school diploma. Of 132 students, 89 graduated, 23 dropped out, 11 received a modified diploma, and nine were still in high school the following year. In September 2011, all freshman students were required to participate in the Middle College for Advanced Studies. This program was explained as follows: Freshmen and sophomores will focus on their core subjects at Jefferson. They will learn such skills as study habits and organization to prepare them for college coursework and will move through classes in groups ‚Äî or academies - with the same set of teachers. As students are ready, they will move to college prep classes at Jefferson and college courses at PCC Cascade Campus, mostly in their junior and senior years. PCC pathways will range from preparation for a four-year college to careers such as EMT, medical assistant, firefighter, and heating, ventilation and cooling technician. College coursework is offered at no cost to Jefferson students. Students who receive special education services may participate in the Middle College as recommended by their individualized education plan teams. Students who are learning English may participate in the Middle College by taking credit-bearing ESOL courses and other courses consistent with their English language level. Counselors and advisers at PCC and Jefferson will closely support students as they progress. Self Enhancement, Inc., a youth-development nonprofit, will provide such core support services as tutoring and mentoring to all Jefferson students. Students will earn a high school diploma from Jefferson as well as 12 to 45 college credits from PCC that are fully transferable to other colleges and universities. =Dance program= In the mid-1970s, in an attempt to integrate the student body, Jefferson High School introduced the magnet arts program and the dance program to attract students from other Portland high school attendance areas. The dance program was founded by Mary Vinton Folberg, sister of Will Vinton (creator of Claymation). Folberg modelled the Jefferson Dance Department after the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts. While the magnet arts and dance program attracted some white students from other school attendance areas, some argue that this has not led to integrating the student body, and that only a small percentage of black students in this traditionally black school are able to enroll in the dance and arts programs. The Jefferson dance program teaches different levels of a broad range of dance styles, including ballet, tap, African, modern, hip hop and jazz. Twice each school year the students' achievements are publicly showcased in recitals in the school's auditorium: one in the winter and one in the spring. Considered a foundation of many types of dance, ballet is an essential part of many dance students' educations. However, the Jefferson dance program and school-based company, the Jefferson Dancers, lacked advanced ballet training for about a decade. In the 2009 winter recital, the Jefferson Dancers performed the school's first piece en pointe in about ten years. =The Jefferson Dancers= World-famous choreographer Donald McKayle (seated, center) posed with members of the Jefferson Dancers, in 1992, after a week-long rehearsal in which he taught the company two of his signature dances: \\"Games\\" and \\"Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder\\" In the late 1970s, Folberg founded the student dance company The Jefferson Dancers. Since its founding, the company has grown and changed, exposing its members to a diverse range of dance styles, including ballet, modern, African, tap, jazz and hip hop. The company's dance instructors are highly qualified and have led successful dance careers. Some instructors have continued to perform during their involvement with the Jefferson Dancers. Promising company members are awarded scholarships at each spring recital, and company auditions are held for two days each spring. The company performs twice annually at Jefferson High School's winter and spring dance recitals, as well as throughout Portland, Oregon, and the world. The company toured in Germany in April 2009, Italy in March 2011, and China in 2013. Athletics The Jeff High Democrat = Men's basketball= The men's basketball team has been one of the most successful programs in Oregon. Jefferson has produced 18 D1 basketball recruits since 1998. Some previous democrat recruits have chosen to play at Washington, Texas, Gonzaga, Kentucky, Oregon, USC, Kansas, Michigan, and other schools. 6 former players were ranked in the top 100 in the country and Terrence Jones was named a Mcdonald's All American in 2010. Jefferson has won state titles in 1951, 1972, 2000, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014, and 2017.

The Lunacy Act's most important provision was a change in the status of mentally ill people to patients. Background Prior to the Lunacy Act, lunacy legislation in England was enshrined in the County Asylums Act of 1808, which established institutions for poor and for criminally-insane, mentally ill people. The institutions were called asylums and they gave refuge where mental illness could receive proper treatment. The first asylum owing to the County Asylums Act opened at Northampton in 1811. By 1827 however only nine county asylums had opened and many patients were still in gaol as prisoners and criminals. As a consequence of this slow progress the Lunacy Act 1845 created the Lunacy Commission to focus on lunacy legislation.Unsworth, Clive.\\"Law and Lunacy in Psychiatry's 'Golden Age'\\", Oxford Journal of Legal Studies. Vol. 13, No. 4. (Winter, 1993), pp. 482. The Act was championed by Anthony Ashley- Cooper, Seventh Earl of Shaftesbury. Shaftesbury was the head of the Commission from its founding in 1845 until his death in 1885.Unsworth, 1993, pp. 482. The Lunacy Commission was made up of eleven Metropolitan Commissioners. The Commission was monumental as it was not only a full-time commission, but it was also salaried for six of its members. The six members of the commission that were full-time and salaried were made up of three members of the legal system and three members of the medical community. The other five members of the commission were all honorary members that simply had to attend board meetings. The duty of the Commission was to establish and carry out the provisions of the Act. Wright, David: \\"Mental Health Timeline\\", 1999 Provisions The Act established the Commissioners in Lunacy to inspect plans for asylums on behalf of the Home Secretary (s.3). The Act required asylums, other than Bethlem Hospital, to be registered with the Commission, to have written regulations and to have a resident physician (s.42). Under the Act, patients lost their right of access to the courts to challenge their detention. Detention could only be reviewed by the commissioners or county visitors. The Commission had many roles in carrying out the act. It established a network of public county institutions. It monitored the conditions in the asylums and the treatment of the patients. It made a point of reaching out to patients in workhouses and prisons and getting them to the proper institutions where they could be treated. It also focused on \\"single lunatics\\" who were not connected with any prisons or workhouse but needed psychiatric care. It monitored the treatment and mental condition of patients whom the Commission could not remove from prisons and workhouses.Wright, 1999 1845 County Asylums Act The Lunacy Act of 1845 was passed through Parliament simultaneously with the 1845 County Asylums Act. The two acts were dependent on each other. The Lunacy Act established the Lunacy Commission and the County Asylums Act set forth most of the provisions as to what was to be monitored within the asylums and helped establish the public network of the county asylums. Like the Lunacy Act, there had been several drafts of this act passed before 1845 and several afterward as well. The most notable of these were the 1808, and the 1853 County Asylum Acts. The Lunacy Act itself was amended several times after its conception. There was a new version written in both 1846 and 1847. Both of these versions were actually repealed by the 1853 County Asylums Act. The importance of these two acts together is that they consolidated Lunacy Law in England. However, no legislation has ever combined the entirety of Lunacy Law. Both of these acts were the basis for Lunacy Law in England until 1890 when both of them were repealed by the Lunacy Act of 1890.The Lunacy Commission Children and the Lunacy Act of 1845 When the Lunacy Act was passed in 1845, there were many questions raised about what to do with children in poor mental health. Insane children were more common than is commonly appreciated. The confusion arose because the Act gave no age limits on patients in the asylums. Adair, Forsythe, and Melling: \\"'A Proper Lunatic for Two Years': Pauper Lunatic Children in Victorian and Edwardian England. Child Admissions to the Devon County Asylum, 1845‚Äì1914\\", Journal of Social History, Vol. 31, No. 2. (Winter, 1997), pp. 371, Some of the inspections conducted by the Lunacy Commission involved inspecting workhouses where the Commission would often find mentally unhealthy children and press for them to be removed. However, many of the asylums were hesitant to admit children. Because of this, some children were admitted under the guise that they were in urgent need of help and constituted a serious danger to themselves and others.Adair, Forsythe, and Melling, 1997, pp.373  See also  *County Asylums Act 1808 *County Asylums Act 1828 *List of asylums commissioned in England and Wales Notes External links *Web pages by Andrew Roberts at Middlesex University: **Table of Statutes on Mental Health **The Lunacy Commission Category:1845 in law Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1845 Category:Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom concerning England and Wales Category:Legal history of England Category:Mental health law in the United Kingdom Category:History of mental health in the United Kingdom ","title":"Lunacy Act 1845"},{"id":"2514278","text":", also known as Ghosts at School, is a 20-episode anime series created in 2000 by Pierrot and Aniplex for Fuji Television, based on a book series by T≈çru Tsunemitsu. The series was licensed for the North American market by ADV Films whose English dub replaced the original script with a comedic one. It was also aired in Latin America by Cartoon Network, which had broadcast the entire series unedited on October 1, 2005. The series was also picked up by the anime television network, Animax, who broadcast the series with a different English dub unedited and uncensored under the title Ghosts at School within its respective networks across the world in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and other regions. Plot Ghost Stories tells the tale of Satsuki Miyanoshita, who moves with her family to the hometown of her deceased mother. On her first day of school, Satsuki, her brother Keiichirou ‚Äì a first-grader, Hajime Aoyama ‚Äì their neighbor, Momoko Koigakubo ‚Äì an older schoolmate, and Leo Kakinoki ‚Äì a classmate and friend of Hajime's with a penchant for the paranormal visit the abandoned school building adjacent the current school complex and discover that the building is haunted. It is soon after revealed that Satsuki's mother was responsible for sealing several ghosts who haunted not only the school but also the town, and now they are released due to the urbanization taking place in the surrounding area. Satsuki's mother left behind a book detailing how to exorcise the ghosts once and for all. In her first confrontation, Satsuki faces a demon called Amanojaku, but in the process Amanojaku is sealed within Satsuki's pet cat, Kaya. Although Amanojaku does not want to help Satsuki at first, the danger soon threatens to envelop the town and it is left up to Satsuki, her friends and Amanojaku to stop the ghosts. At last, with the help of Amanojaku, the friends finally are able to exorcise the ghosts. Characters ; : : Satsuki is the main character of the show. She moves with her father and her little brother Keiichirou to the hometown of her deceased mother, where she finds that her mother confronted several evil entities that haunted the town, which included Amanojaku, and wrote all her supernatural experiences in a diary, which is entitled \\"The Ghost Journal\\". Satsuki is very strong, brave and determined within, but sometimes a bit moody, mostly because of Hajime's reckless behavior. She has a crush on Hajime. Her name means \\"May\\". ; : : Momoko is a 6th grader and Satsuki's best friend. She seems to fear nothing, even in dangerous situations, and is very brave when it comes to helping Satsuki and the gang confront the ghosts. She also has a psychic connection with Satsuki's mother. In the ADV's English dub, she's a born again Evangelical Christian, and almost every sentence she utters contains a thinly- veiled reference to Christianity. Her name means \\"peach child\\". Momo means peach and -ko, a typical ending for female names, means child. ; : : Hajime is Satsuki's neighbor. He is strong and courageous, but has cowardly tendencies. Despite this, he is one of the most reliable of Satsuki's friends. In the ADV's English dub, Hajime has a big ego and is much more perverted with his comments and dialogue. His name means \\"beginning\\". ; : : Leo is Hajime's friend and has a big obsession with paranormal themes, and proclaims himself as a respected paranormal researcher. However, whenever Leo finds a clue pertaining to the existence of supernatural entities, it seems that the clue turns against him. Like Hajime, he tries to be brave, but most of the time shows cowardice. In the English dub by ADV, his name was romanized as \\"Leo\\", and he is Jewish. His name means \\"lion\\". ; : : Keiichiro is Satsuki's younger brother. He is easily frightened, fooled, manipulated and often cries, but on rare occasions shows courage in defeating the ghosts. Because of his weaknesses he often creates situations which the other characters have to solve. He creates a special friendship with the ghost Amanojaku. In the ADV's English dub, his incompetence was elevated to the state of being mentally challenged. In times of stress, as well as randomly, his speech turns into childish babbling. He behaves oddly and often busts into laughter, tears or squeals randomly. ; : : Amanojaku is a powerful entity that, long ago, was sealed by Satsuki's mother in a tree in the mountains, but was finally released from his magic prison when that tree was cut down during urbanization. However, he did not have his freedom long, as Satsuki accidentally sealed him in the body of her pet cat, Kaya. At first, Amanojaku is hostile toward the kids and takes great pleasure in seeing them in trouble, but throughout the series he develops an attachment to them (especially Satsuki and Keiichiro) and starts helping them in giving clues and sometimes gives direct help to the kids. He is the typical tsundere anime character. ; : : Mr Sakata is the teacher of the class where Satsuki, Hajime and Reo attend. Despite not believing in ghosts, he suffers as a victim from many supernatural incidents. Mr Sakata is often possessed, cursed and kidnapped by ghosts. A running gag in the English Dub has him exclaiming his hatred for an unseen teacher named Ms. Hadley. ; : : Reiichirou is Satsuki's father. He has no clue about his daughter's supernatural duties and also doesn't believe in ghosts. ; : : Kayako is Satsuki's and Keiichirou's deceased mother. Through her diary it is revealed that she was an avid exorcist during her childhood. She possesses Momoko two times throughout the series to aid Satsuki against the Piano Ghost and Kutabe and once helped Satsuki and the others to escape from a powerful haunting called Anamnaneki. Her maiden name was Kamiyama. It was revealed that she is haunting The Ghost Journal that she made for Satsuki (this was proven when The Ghost Journal content disappeared after Satsuki exorcised all ghost that she dealt with during her childhood) and assisting her through the diary or possessing Momomko. She's either lesbian or bisexual in the ADV English dub. Media =ADV dub= On the weekend of August 19, 2005, at the 2005 Otakon anime convention, ADV Films announced an October 2005 release of Ghost Stories on DVD for North American distribution. The original Japanese audio and literal subtitle translation are also included on the DVD. Volume one of Ghost Stories went on sale on October 22, 2005. On August 28, 2013 Discotek Media announced that they licensed the series and would release it in 2014 with the ADV dub and the Japanese audio with English subtitles. The entire series was released on a three-disc set on March 25, 2014. The dub deviated significantly from the original script in favour of less serious, comedically written dialog while retaining the basic plot structure and storyline. Jokes include topical pop culture references, politically incorrect jokes about race, religion, and sexuality; as well as jokes about the original show's poor animation quality. Although the dub wasn't very well received when it was first released, it has established a cult following over time. The English script was written by ADV screenwriter Steven Foster, but the majority of the dialog was ad-libbed by the English voice actors. =Music= *Opening Theme \\"Growup\\" **Music and Lyrics: Takuya **Arrangement: Sakuma Masahide, Hysteric Blue **Artist: Hysteric Blue *Ending Theme \\"Sexy Sexy,\\" **Lyrics: MASASHI, TAMA **Composer: MASASHI **Arrangement: CASCADE, Cozy Kubo **Artist: CASCADE See also * School Ghost Stories, the film from which the series was adapted * List of ghost films References External links *Studio Pierrot's Gakkou no Kaidan website Review at The Black Moon Category:Gakk≈ç no Kaidan Category:2000 anime television series Category:ADV Films Category:Aniplex Category:Dark comedy anime and manga Category:Discotek Media Category:Fiction about urban legends Category:Fuji TV original programming Category:Horror anime and manga Category:Pierrot (company) Category:Supernatural anime and manga ","title":"Ghost Stories (Japanese TV series)"},{"id":"2514283","text":"The International Day of Peace, sometimes officially known as World Peace Day, is a United Nations-sanctioned holiday observed annually on 21 September. It is dedicated to world peace, and specifically the absence of war and violence, such as might be occasioned by a temporary ceasefire in a combat zone for humanitarian aid access. The day was first celebrated in 1981, and is kept by many nations, political groups, military groups, and people. In 2013 the day was dedicated by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to peace education, the key preventive means to reduce war sustainably. To inaugurate the day, the United Nations Peace Bell is rung at UN Headquarters (in New York City). The bell is cast from coins donated by children from all continents except Africa, and was a gift from the United Nations Association of Japan, as \\"a reminder of the human cost of war\\"; the inscription on its side reads, \\"Long live absolute world peace\\".

It has 4,109 inhabitants (2013). History The first mention of the village dates from 1065 with the so-called \\"Falsyfikat mogile≈Ñski\\" a document from the Benedictine monastery in Mogilno. The town is situated on the route which was the trade route leading from Gda≈Ñsk and Truso to Rus'. Serock It showed also in a list from 1113-1124, where it was mentioned as one of the most important princely castles of Mazovia, which operated a river crossing (the Bug and Narew rivers intersect beside Serock) with a customs house. From 1417, Serock was granted city rights under Che≈Çmno law by Janusz I of Warsaw. By then it was already a craft and commercial center. From this period the urban layout was created in the form of the market square and the late Gothic church of the parish. In the 15th and 17th century municipal courts were held there. From 1655-1660, during the Swedish invasion, the city was largely destroyed. From 1795, it was in the Prussian partition, from 1807 it came under the possession of the Duchy of Warsaw, and from 1815 it was under Russian rule. Serock repeatedly was on the battle lines on the outskirts of Warsaw, including in 1794, 1809 and 1831. In 1806, on the orders of Napoleon I fortifications were built in Serock. From 1807 it was a fortress. During the Polish‚ÄìAustrian war in 1809, it was the operational location of General J√≥zef Niemojewski's troops. Then the fortress was expanded (at the initiative of the French Marshal Davout) until 1811, when it gained greater importance than Modlin Fortress. In 1831 the Polish army formed in Serock (during the November Uprising). In 1870, the city was deprived of city rights. They were recovered in 1923. In September 1939, was a place of fighting during the Invasion of Poland, and again in 1944 and 1945, between the Soviets and the Germans. In December 5, 1939, around 3,000 Jews were deported from the city by the Germans. From 1940-1944 there was a forced labor camp there, and in 1942 the ghetto contained around two thousand people. During World War II, Serock was in the Third Reich, the boundary between the Third Reich and the General Government proceeded along the Narew river. In November -- December 1944 the Eastern Front ran through the town. Germany defended from Serock across the Narew against the Red Army. The Russians launched a massive Katyusha rocket launcher attack resulting in Serock's destruction. After the war it was rebuilt. Today there are no Jews. In the summer of 2000, a visiting descendant of former residents discovered that a number of gravestones (matzevot) were piled up in the city park. The stones had been gathered by a non-Jewish resident who roped off the area. In 2006, a visit by members of the Jewish Records Indexing-Poland project confirmed this and an attempt is under way to establish a memorial on the site of the former Jewish cemetery. The United States Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad is involved in the project. = The model settlement Barbarka = A model of the Barbarka settlement An early medieval settlement called Ogrodziskiem or BarbarkƒÖ was located on the right bank of the Narew river, near the mouth of the Bug river. Its development was from the 11th to 13th centuries. It represents one of the oldest castles in Mazovia. The settlement was located on two trade and communication routes: * To Rus: Nur, Brok, and Bra≈Ñsk to Wielkopolska, Kujawy and Pomerania; * From southern Poland to Jaƒáwie≈ºy and Prussia. During the tests conducted in 1961 by Prof. Dr. Zdzis≈Çaw Rajewski, pieces of pottery, pugging (flooring) and parts of animal bones were found. Excavations carried out from 1962 to 1966 by Barbarƒô ZawadzkƒÖ-Antosik showed three stages of the early settlement and human functioning in these areas in the 14th and 17th centuries. They also located the cemetery and a nave chapel with apse. Approximately 200 archaeological sites were excavated consisting of, among others, fragments of pottery, animal bones and the remains of fish. They showed that the people mainly engaged in agriculture (cultivated wheat, rye, peas), fishing, weaving and craft work.  Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary  Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Serock The brick, one-nave church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Ko≈õci√≥≈Ç Zwiastowania Naj≈õwiƒôtszej Maryi Panny) - formerly St. Adalbert's (≈õw. Wojciecha) - was founded by the dukes of Mazovia: Janusz III and Stanislaus. The initiator was a Serock pastor Wojciech Popielski of Popiel≈ºyna. The church was built between the first quarter and the end of the 16th century. In the 3rd quarter of the 18th century, the window was rebuilt. It has been restored many times, notably from 1934 to 1938. The church has a floor positioned below the level of the environment, a simple closed chancel, two symmetrically placed vestries, a three-bay nave, and a tower. It was built on a thread cross. The vaults of the nave barrel vault with lunettes of the star superimposed on grid ribs. On the eastern slope is the inscription IH1586 . There is a picture showing Stanislas Witold Bienias‚Äô Battle of Warsaw in 1920 as well as original baroque items such as: * the main altar, which shows the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary * sculptures of St. Adalbert and St. Stanislaus * side altar of St. Anne * side altar of St. Barbara * a font In 1961, the church was entered in the Polish register of monuments.  Industry  In Serock there are small service and manufacturing industries. Goods manufactured here are mainly food, electrical engineering, ceramics, furniture and equipment. Around the village, strawberries and vegetables are grown.  Tourism  Serock is a recreational and relaxation site. Holiday resorts and conference and training centres are located here or nearby. There is also a haven for passenger shipping. There are numerous organised hiking trails, including the road brook and ravine at the top of the Barbarka. Through the village runs the tourist walking trail with Dƒôbego. As a result of the damming of the Bug and Narew rivers, conditions are ideal for water sports and fishing. There are approximately 4,500 recreational homes in the area. The location is also a center of culture and sport. There's a lot of organised cultural events, including the International Folklore Review Kupalnocka (including experienced teams from Taiwan, Russia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Chile, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden, Greece, Egypt, Italy, France, Turkey, Canada, Croatia, and the Netherlands) and Serock Summer Music (including vocal and instrumental concerts at the top of Barbarka).  Communication  Serock is at an intersection of national roads 61 and 62 which has bus connections but no railway connections.

The salute usually goes along with the Serbian flag, using several semantic layers to depict its historical meaning, while also being used a symbol of Serbian ethno-nationalism during the Guƒça Trumpet Festival. Origin =Orthodox symbolism= In Serbian and Orthodox tradition, the number three is exceptionally important. Three fingers are used when signing the cross in Orthodoxy, symbolizing the Trinity. The Serbs, when swearing Oath, historically used the three fingers (collected, as when crossing) along with the greetings \\"My Holy Trinity\\" (Serbian: –°–≤–µ—Ç–æ–≥ –º–∏ –¢—Ä–æ—ò—Å—Ç–≤–∞ / Svetog mi Trojstva) or \\"for the Honorable Cross and Golden Freedom\\" (–∑–∞ –∫—Ä—Å—Ç —á–∞—Å–Ω–∏ –∏ —Å–ª–æ–±–æ–¥—É –∑–ª–∞—Ç–Ω—É / za krst ƒçasni i slobodu zlatnu) during formal and religious events. The salute was often made with both hands, raised above the head. Serbian peasants sealed a pledge by raising three fingers to the face, the face being \\"the focus of honour\\" in Balkan culture. A Serbian proverb goes \\"There is no cross without three fingers\\" (–Ω–µ–º–∞ –∫—Ä—Å—Ç–∞ –±–µ–∑ —Ç—Ä–∏ –ø—Ä—Å—Ç–∞ / nema krsta bez tri prsta). Karaƒëorƒëe was appointed leader of the Serbian rebels after they all raised their \\"three fingers in the air\\" and thereby swore Oath. The Takovo Uprising (1888), by renowned Serbian painter Paja Jovanoviƒá. The three fingers were viewed as a symbol of Serbdom in the 19th century. Njego≈° mentioned \\"the crossing with three fingers has not remained\\" when speaking of the Islamization of Serbs, a central theme in The Mountain Wreath (1847). Paja Jovanoviƒá's painting, The Takovo Uprising (1888), depicts Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá holding a war flag and saluting with three fingers. The Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik, which supported that Serbs had three faiths (Orthodoxy, Catholicism and Islam), criticized the Pan-Serbists who according to them only \\"truly believed those Serbs, who cross with three fingers\\". A short story published in 1901 surrounds a Serbian despot meeting with a Szil√°gyi, who has the despot's three fingers cut off by Franciscan friars after discussing the right way of crossing. Serbian Metropolitan Nikolaj Velimiroviƒá (1881‚Äì1956) called for a Serbian salute in which three fingers were to be raised along the greeting: \\"Thus Help Us God!\\". In 1937, Velimiroviƒá began a sermon protesting the Catholic support for separation of state and religion in Yugoslavia with \\"Raise three fingers, Orthodox Serbs!\\". During World War II, the Catholic church in Independent State of Croatia sought that the Serbs renounce crossing with three fingers. A letter from the Chetniks to the Yugoslav Partisans stressed that the real government was in London (in exile) and that they would kill all who did not cross themselves with three fingers. An Ustashe song went Nesta krsta sa tri prsta (\\"Gone is the crossing with three fingers\\") which was referred to Muslim daily ablution and Orthodox way to make sign of the cross. =Modern form= Vuk Dra≈°koviƒá, the leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement political party, said in a 2007 interview that he first used it in 1990 at the founding meeting of the party, inspired by Paja Jovanoviƒá's painting. During the March 1991 street demonstrations in Belgrade, the three fingers were massively used by Dra≈°koviƒá's supporters, representing the three demands that the Serbian Renewal Movement had put before the government. Usage Boris Tadiƒá electoral rally. According to political scientist Anamaria Dutceac Segeste, the significance of the salute is diverse: although it has been used by nationalists, it cannot be monopolized as such; it has been used without aggressive nationalist connotations, i.e. at sport events, by opponents of Milo≈°eviƒá, by President Boris Tadiƒá during the 2008 Summer Olympics, etc. The salute is used by members and supporters of almost all Serbian political parties on their rallies during election campaigns. It can be seen at all kinds of street demonstrations and celebrations. Croats, Bosniaks, and Kosovar Albanians, who have been at war with Serbs in the past, find the salute provocative. A 1998 Politika news article spoke of the \\"perennial demonization\\" of the salute, \\"which had already entered the catalogue of planitarian gestures\\", together with the closed fist, outstretched palm and V sign. =Yugoslav wars= During the Yugoslav wars, the salute was widely used as a Serb symbol. In the prelude of the Bosnian War, Bosnian Serbs were encouraged to vote in the 1991 referendum through posters which displayed the three fingers. During the wars, Serb soldiers raised the three fingers as a sign of victory. When Russian peacekeeping troops entered Sarajevo in 1994, they used the salute when greeting the Serb troops, and because of this, they were branded pro-Serb; the UNPROFOR used the Serb salute when greeting the Serbs, and the V sign when greeting the Bosniaks, showing impartiality. In 2006, the United Nations published the case titled IT-00-39-T from the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, describing several atrocities committed by Serb military and police forces on Bosniak and Croatian civilians on July 20, 1992, in the villages Keratem, Omarska and Trnopolje. Detaines were executed, humiliated, and were forced to spit on the Bosnian flag and do the three- finger sign. There were instances when non-Serb captives were forced to use the salute. According to a BBC documentary about the Srebrenica massacre, published by Human Rights Watch on August 16, 1995, Bosnian Serb forces transported Bosnian civilians in busses to the village of Tisca. During the travel the civilians saw Chetniks showed the three-finger symbol and when they arrived, Serb police forces forced them to surrender them to hand over gold and jewellery and threatening to chop off the women's breasts. In 2008, The Bosnian newspaper Osloboƒëenje published a coverage of the arrest of Radovan Karad≈æiƒá. On July 24, the paper accusingly compared the leaders of Republic Srpska with those of the wartime era in the front paper depicting Milorad Dodik next to Karad≈æiƒá with a photograph of Dodik giving the three-fingered salute during the war. =Kosovo War= On October 22, 1999, Human Rights Watch obtained photographs from the KLA administration in Peƒá depicting Serb soldiers carrying assault rifle, doing the three-finger salute and standing in front of burning houses. KLA officials told the Human Rights Watch that the photographs had been found in the homes of ethnic Serb citizens in the Peƒá area after Serbian and Yugoslav forces withdrew from Kosovo on June 12. In 1999, after the NATO bombing of Serbia, Colin Woodard wrote about thousands of Serbian Americans who filled the park opposite the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, shouting \\"Kosovo is Serbia\\" and \\"Stop the bombing\\", while wearing military caps and making the three-finger salute. Serb Orthodox priests at the gathering spoke to the crowd, stating that \\"Serbia was a civilised nation\\". In 2001, after the end of the Kosovo war, the UCPMB forces were to hand over themselves to the KFOR, however, an incident occurred when Serb forces shot dead a UCPMB senior commander (who was not keen on the agreement with the KFOR) as he accidentally drove into a village where Serb generals led a parade giving the Serbian three fingered salute. =Usage in sports= NBA basketball player Aleksandar Pavloviƒá displaying the three-finger salute Serbian White Eagles FC players and fans after a victory In a famous photograph of the Red Star Belgrade team celebrating their victory at the 1990‚Äì91 European Cup, eight players are seen using the Serb salute, while a Croatian player, Robert Prosineƒçki, is not. After winning the 1995 European basketball championship, the entire then-Yugoslav team displayed the three fingers. Aleksandar ƒêorƒëeviƒá says he flashed the three fingers \\"not to be provocative. Just: that's Serbia, that's us, that's me ‚Äì nothing else. It's my pride.\\" Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic raises three fingers after his victories. In 2001, Australian football team Perth Glory's Bobby Despotovski (of Serbian parentage) was sanctioned by the Australian Soccer Federation for giving the salute to the predominantly Croatian-community crowd at a Melbourne Knights home game and inciting a fight; Despotovski and coach Bernd Stange were subsequently assaulted by Knights fans, forcing the next fixture between the sides to be moved to Launceston. Serbian water polo player Aleksandar ≈†apiƒá said in 2007 that \\"I know that it was used by soldiers in war, but I do not raise three fingers because I hate someone. I respect all peoples, and know what is in my heart.\\" The salute was met with controversy in Turkey after Du≈°ko To≈°iƒá, playing for Be≈üikta≈ü, used the salute after Serbia won over Albania in the guest match in the UEFA 2016 qualifiers; Be≈üikta≈ü fans threatened him through Turkish media. There have been instances in the former Yugoslavia where supporters paradoxically borrow symbols and slogans from the other ethnic groups: in May 2003, Bosnian Croat club ≈†iroki Brijeg fans, during a match against Bosniak FK ≈Ωeljezniƒçar Sarajevo, chanted \\"kill the Turk\\" and raised the three-finger salute. =Modern-day usage= 2007 Eurovision winner Marija ≈†erifoviƒá used the salute when celebrating points; controversially, she used the salute when receiving the maximum of 12 points from Bosnian viewers, after which Bosnian media reported it as being used as a direct provocation. The Swedish-Serbian National Association called it 'ridiculous', saying that the salute is not to be mistaken in that way, but viewed of as nothing more than 'a modified V sign'. Rade Leskovac, president of a Serb minority party in Croatia, caused controversy in 2007 when election posters featuring him with the salute were posted around Vukovar.

The word chelys was used in allusion to the oldest lyre of the Greeks, which was said to have been invented by Hermes. According to the Homeric Hymn to Hermes, he came across a tortoise near the threshold of his mother's home and decided to hollow out the shell to make the soundbox of an instrument with seven strings. Cylix of Apollo with the chelys lyre, on a 5th-century BC drinking cup (kylix) The word has been applied arbitrarily since classic times to various stringed instruments, some bowed and some plucked, probably owing to the back being much vaulted. Athanasius Kircher (Musurgia universalis, 486) applied the name of chelys to a kind of viol with eight strings. Numerous representations of the chelys lyre or testudo occur on Greek vases, in which the actual tortoiseshell is depicted. A good illustration is given in Le Antichit√† di Ercolano (vol. i. p1. 43).The ancient Roman site of Herculaneum is preserved from the 1st century AD. At Herculaneum a wall painting contains a painting of a chelys lyre. The painting is re- depicted in the book Le Antichit√† di Ercolano Esposte (the Antiquities of Herculaneum Exposed), volume 1 page 43, year 1757: ONLINE. A picture of a modern replica of an ancient chelys lyre is at the website of The British Museum. Propertius (iv. 6) calls the instrument the lyra testudinea. Joseph Justus ScaligerScaliger, introductory notes to his edition of Marcus Manilius, Astronomicon, 1579. was probably the first writer to draw attention to the difference between the chelys and the kithara. The acoustics of an authentically reconstructed ancient Greek tortoise-shell lyre, known as chelys, was investigated recently.E. Bakarezos, V. Vathis, S. Brezas, Y. Orphanos and N.A. Papadogiannis, ‚ÄúAcoustics of the Chelys - An ancient Greek tortoise-shell lyre‚Äù Applied Acoustics 73, 478 (2012) Modern experimental methods were employed, such as electronic speckle pattern laser interferometry and impulse response, to extract the vibrational behavior of the instrument and its main parts. Additionally, the emitted sound from the instrument was recorded, under controlled conditions, and spectrally analyzed. Major findings include the concentration of the emitted sound between 400 Hz and 800 Hz, with an amplitude modified in a manner consistent with the experimentally measured vibrational characteristics of the instrument‚Äôs sound box and bridge. The experimental results validate the historical evidence that chelys was used in Greek antiquity as an accompaniment instrument to the human voice.

They were introduced by Chris Morris of Artemis Innovations Inc. with the brand name \\"Soap\\" in 1997. They have a plastic concavity in the sole, which allows the wearer to grind on objects such as pipes, handrails, and stone ledges. The company and their product rapidly gained popularity through fansites, a video game, and live demonstrations. Soap fell to legal vulnerabilities, and was readministered twice, eventually bringing the brand to Heeling Sports Limited. History Soap shoes were essentially derived from rollerblades, aggressive skating, and Justin Riley. Chris Morris, a resident of California who worked at RollerBlade in Torrance for over sixteen years, worked to customize a simple shoe that had a grind plate embedded in the sole. The shoe was an average Nike, fitted for sliding. Concept 21 (a recently founded design firm) was called upon to design a sample so that the product could be finalized. They then formed Artemis Innovations, which would be the company the brand would be sold under for four years. In 2001, Mr. Morris lost control of the Soap license through legal problems. Activity within the company slowed down, and eventually, the remaining executives sold Soap. In-Stride, a company whose target market was primarily wrestling gear, purchased Soap. In-Stride went bankrupt in late 2002, and Soap was once again available for purchase. Heeling Sports Limited, the company behind the shoes with a wheel in the sole known as Heelys, realized that the grind plate could be very profitable when paired with their wheel, and acquired Soap later that year. In early 2003, six new Soap shoes were released, each in multiple color schemes; simultaneously, HSL was designing hybrid shoes to sell under the Heelys brand. HSL has been criticized for releasing too many new models at a single time, and not supplying requested stock to retailers frequently enough. There are currently no models of Soap shoes being produced by HSL. The sport never caught on to the mass market in comparison to, for instance, skateboarding, but the brand \\"Soap\\" did have a professional team mostly consisting of former professional inline skaters such as Ryan Jaunzemis, Bryndon Smith, Danny Lynch, Paul Cifuentes, Eddie Ramirez, and Ben Kelly (Head of Research & Development, and Soap Shoes' wear-testing team). Soap's heyday was in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when competing crews from across the Americas and Europe were releasing internet videos, spurring an online community of \\"Soapers.\\" These crews have since disbanded along with the website forums, and now there are few proponents left such as solidgrind.com run by Former Soap team captain Derek Brooks and the Melbourne soapers Facebook Page run by Soap Collector Greg Crellin. A revival of sorts was noticed in early 2006 as more people were attracted to Soaping, and HSL responded by re-releasing their Express model in limited quantities. Soap Shoes continue to sluggishly regain popularity despite some difficulty due to Heelys using grind plates in addition to their wheels. That was until the recession had hit, which affected HSL most of all. Heelys stock was once 38 dollars per share, and on August 8, 2007 Heelys had lost half of its stock value in a single day from $21.99 to $11.42. Now former CEO Michael Staffaroni at the time was expecting significant growth despite the stock plummet. Soap Shoes at the time managed to have a very successful demo at Xtreme Wheels Skate Park despite HSL's financial problems. A year later, the Soap Shoes Express was discontinued by HSL and liquidation for Soap Shoes began, with representatives from Heelys claiming to \\"just throw out\\" anything that was left over. Within a matter of five years, Heelys stock had sunk down to $2.25 per share and was sold to Sequential Brand Group for $63.2 million, taking the soap and other grind shoe patents with it. Around the same time, the SOAP Shoes website was taken down with a logo that says it was under development. The SOAP Shoes website is completely blank as of October 2020. Soap shoes in Sonic the Hedgehog Soap shoes were featured in the video game Sonic Adventure 2, developed by Sonic Team USA in San Francisco. This game presented many billboards, blimps, and benches advertising the shoes; also, Sonic wore a custom version of the Scorcher/Nitro shoes exclusive to the title, while the darker character Shadow wears hybrid jet hoverskate/grind shoes, as grinding (or \\"soaping\\") debuted as an important new gameplay element. Grinding remains a core element in recent Sonic games, though officially licensed Soap shoes have given way to his normal shoes. Soap shoes made their reappearance in Sonic Forces as an unlockable accessory for the Avatar and come in three different colors, one of the colors matching the ones used in Sonic Adventure 2. Pending the sale of Soap to In-Stride and later HSL, no actions were taken for the continuation of the partnership. However, in two episodes of the anime Sonic X, Sonic's Soap shoes are brought in to give him an advantage over his enemies. The HD re-release of Sonic Adventure 2 had all of the in-game advertisements but the Soap shoes advertisements were removed.

The transdisciplinary course Literature and Performance (satisfying the requirements of Groups 1 and 6) is also available at Standard Level. Students seeking the IB Diploma may substitute courses from the other five Subject Groups instead of taking a Group 6 course (see below). A school-based syllabus devised by an IB World School, as approved and externally moderated by the IB, may also form the basis for a course taken in place of a Group 6 course. Dance SL and HL IB Dance is available at both standard level (SL) and higher level (HL). For both levels, the candidate must complete an internal assessment, (performance task), and two external assessments (composition and World Dance Investigation). One of the external assessment components requires candidates to write an analytical essay, (the World Dance Investigation, or WDI), comparing and contrasting two dance styles, one of which is familiar to the candidate, and the other is not. At SL, the WDI is 1500 words, whereas at HL, the WDI is 2500 words and must include a comparison of one short dance excerpt from each of the styles being analysed. At SL, the WDI is weighted at 20%, and at HL, the WDI is weighted at 25%. The second external assessment component is Composition and Analysis. The candidate is required to choreograph either two dances totalling 6 - 10 minutes at SL, or three dances totalling 8 - 15 minutes at HL. At HL, two of the dances must show clear compositional contrast. One of the dances in this component must be accompanied by an analytical statement (800 words at SL or 1000 words at HL), documenting and reflecting upon the choreographic process. At HL the statement must include a discussion of how other sections of the IB Dance course have influenced the dance being discussed. At SL, Composition and Analysis is weighted at 40%, and at HL, Composition and Analysis is weighted at 35%. In the internal assessment component (Performance), SL candidates are required to submit one or two dances totalling 3 - 6 minutes, where at least one dance is a solo or a duet, and HL candidates are required to submit two or three dances totalling 6 - 9 minutes, where at least half the time submitted is solo or duet work. For both levels, the dances must be presented at an open showing, and the works must be choreographed by someone other than the candidate. At both levels, short programme notes must be submitted detailing basic information about the dance, including the choreographer's name and the dance's intention. At both levels, Performance is weighted at 40%.IB Dance Guide Music SL and HL IB Music can be taken at either the standard level (SL) or higher level (HL). For both levels of IB Music the candidate must conduct a musical investigation. This requires research of two completely different musical genres with comparable qualities (e.g. Tuvan throat singing and Baroque opera). The information will then be presented in the form of a media script which will be assessed externally. There are three paths in which the IB Music SL course can be taken: group performance, solo performance, or composition. To fulfill the performance requirements, the candidate must perform either a 15-minute solo recital, or a 20-30 minute ensemble performance. A candidate who chooses composition should compose two original compositions (of which one may be an arrangement of an existing piece of music), each lasting between 3 and 6 minutes. Each of the two compositions should be recorded for assessment purposes. A score of both compositions must also be submitted. The IB Music HL course combines a medley of the IB Music SL options into a single curriculum. To satisfy IB Music HL, the candidate must perform solo for a total of 20 minutes and write three contrasting compositions (of which one may be an arrangement), each between 3 and 6 minutes. All candidates sit a written exam at the end of the course, which lasts 3 hours for HL candidates and 2 hours 15 minutes for SL candidates. HL and SL candidates answer two questions from section A (study of two prescribed works), of which one MUST be a comparison between the two prescribed works. HL and SL candidates are also required to complete Section B of the exam, which is aural analysis of four previously unheard extracts, of which two are named, and one has a score provided. Two candidates are unnamed and do not have a score provided. HL only candidates must also complete section C, a comparison of two extracts from section B. Section A responses must be written in essay form. Responses in sections B and C may be in bullet points. Further details of the course can be found in the IB Music Wikibook.Wikibooks:IB Music/Exam Theater SL and HL According to the new syllabus introduced in 2009, the IB Theater Arts programme is made out of four components; two are internally assessed and two are externally assessed. The internal assessments are the Theater Performance and Production Presentation (TPPP) and the Independent Project Portfolio (IPP). The external components are a Practical Performance Proposal (PPP) and a Research Investigation (RI). The TPPP is a presentation on the student's involvement in their performance and production aspects of all areas of the core syllabus. The presentation is 30 minutes long for HL and should be supported by 7‚Äì10 visual materials (no larger than A4). For SL, the presentation is 20 minutes long and should be supported by 5‚Äì7 visual materials (no larger than A4). The IPP is a portfolio of 3000 words at HL and 2000 at SL in which the student reflects on his/her learning and development during the production of an independent project, which is a project in which the student explores and practices a role in the theater (actor, director, dramaturg, scriptwriter, etc.). It should also show a connection to their experiences in the core syllabus. There are two options: Option A: Devising Practice and Option B: Exploring Practice. The portfolio must include sections marked Preparation, Action, and Reflection. For the PPP, the student has to adopt a directorial perspective and write a concept for a play using one of the prescribed stimuli. For SL, it contains a 250-word pitch and explanatory, visual material that illustrates the student's understanding of the intended process of realization. For HL, it also includes a 1,000-1,250 word rationale. The RI is a research essay in which the student presents his or her research on a previously unfamiliar theater practice. From the chosen theater practice, students should choose a specific aspect of a play or theater piece and create a research question to answer. Student's research should contribute to a realization of the play or theater piece from their chosen theatrical practice. The practice cannot be studied in class and must be no later than the 19th century. The question must be taken from a directorial, actor, or designer perspective. For SL, the essay must be 1,500-1,750 words with visual documentation and/or textual references. For HL, the essay must be 2,000-2,500 words with visual documentation and/or textual references. At HL, students must also write a critique of the sources in the research investigation. Visual Arts SL and HL There are two areas of focus in the IB Visual Arts subject. The first is studio (practical work) and the second is the research workbook (known as the Investigation Workbook). The Visual Art program aims to teach the student about design, structure and the aesthetic development of work. The candidates must demonstrate creative and personal thinking, feeling and interaction with their work. The exam for Visual Art encourages the candidate to articulate their concerns and development over the course of the two years of study. An exhibition will be held at the candidate's school showcasing the candidate's work and is assessed by his/her teacher. The assessment is an interview where the candidate talks about their exhibited works, this interview is recorded and sent overseas for moderation. However, the alternate to the interview process is to write a 1000 word statement on your IB journey in Visual Arts. This given mark is then moderated against the Record of Workbook, which contains a collection of photographs of the candidates work and a number of scanned pages from their research workbook. The candidates' research workbooks are also marked, once internally and once externally (for moderation purposes). These books aim to show the candidates journey over the two years of study. They document art and design history that is relevant to the candidate‚Äôs exploration of ideas and will also contain notes, sketches, photographs, mind-maps and pictures of inspiration, development and final works. The candidate must also document a number of art exhibition visits. For the final assessment, either the studio work or the investigation work book can be assessed externally. With 60% of the final grade being placed on that which is externally assessed, and the remaining 40% on the internal assessment. Film SL and HL IB Film can be taken at either the standard level (SL) or higher level (HL). For both levels of IB Film, the candidate must research and write an Independent Study, do a Practical Project and give an oral presentation, based on the close analysis of a 5-minute extract from a film prescribed by the IBO. The Independent Study is a research project that must be presented in the form of a Documentary Script, in which the candidate undertakes an individual investigation based on a topic of film history or theory. At SL, it should focus on a minimum of 2 films from different cultures, whereas at HL, it should focus on at least 4 films from different cultures. It is marked externally. The Practical Project takes the form of a short film (4‚Äì5 minutes at SL and 6‚Äì7 minutes at HL) and a production portfolio and rationale about the work undertaken. The candidate must focus on one of five production roles: Director, Writer, Cinematographer, Editor or Sound Designer. Additionally, at HL, the candidate must produce an individual trailer of his or her film. (45 seconds-1 minute long). It is marked internally and moderated externally. The Oral Presentation should focus on a 5-minute extract of a film set by the IBO, which also places the extract on a broader sociohistorical context and in terms of the film as a whole. The presentation lasts 10 minutes at SL and 15 minutes at HL. The IBO chooses 8 films (four from before 1960 and four from after 1960), from which the Film Teacher then chooses 3. The candidates then select from these three. The films analyzed cannot be studied in class. Film SL is offered online to students enrolled in the IB Diploma Programme.Pamoja Education Courses  Substituting courses from other subject groups  Group 6 subjects are considered electives, thus an IB Diploma candidate may substitute a variety of courses from other subject groups in lieu of taking a Group 6 course. This would result in a student studying an extra language, taking an extra social science or experimental science course, or taking Further Mathematics HL (provided that student is already taking Mathematics HL). The Group 3 Information in a Global Society (ITGS) course would be taken only as sixth subjects, as they do not satisfy the IB Diploma requirements for their respective subject groups.

He has notably played Premier League football for Chelsea and has also played for Barnsley, Swansea City, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Ross County, Grimsby Town and Dover Athletic. Career =Chelsea= Born in Aberdeen, and raised in Gardenstown, a fishing village in the North East Aberdeenshire coast, Watt began his career with Chelsea, making his debut against Scunthorpe United in the FA Cup in January 2005. He played the full 90 minutes and earned praise from Jos√© Mourinho for his performance. On 15 May 2005 Watt made his Premier League debut coming on as an 89th-minute substitute for Jiri Jarosik in the away fixture with Newcastle United. The game ended 1‚Äì1, with Watt playing alongside the likes of Frank Lampard, Ricardo Carvalho, Claude Mak√©l√©l√©, Joe Cole and Ei√∞ur Gu√∞johnsen. In November 2005 Watt spent a month on loan to Barnsley, for whom he made three starts, scoring an injury time equaliser against Rotherham United. =Swansea City= Shortly after returning to Chelsea he was allowed to leave the Premier League club and joined Swansea on 10 January 2006. Watt joined Inverness Caledonian Thistle on a season long loan to regain his match fitness. He made his debut in the Scottish League Cup against Arbroath. Despite a fairly solid performance, he never played again for the first team and left the club to return to Swansea City. Watt suffered persistent shoulder injuries during his time with Swansea, which meant that his contract was not extended when it expired at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season. =Ross County= Following a successful trial, he signed a two-year deal with Ross County in August 2008. Watt made his debut for Ross County on 16 November 2008 in the Challenge Cup Final against Airdrie United. He scored his first goal for the club against Dunfermline on 13 February 2010. =Grimsby Town= On 17 July 2010 Watt played for Grimsby Town in the club's 2‚Äì1 friendly victory over Sheffield Wednesday, and went on to make several impressive appearances for Town in their pre-season campaign. On 2 August 2010, Watt signed a two-year deal with Grimsby. He scored his first goal for the club in a 1‚Äì0 win over Darlington on 24 August 2010, and went on to partner Darran Kempson as the club's preferred centre backs during the first part of the season under Neil Woods. However Woods was eventually sacked midway through the season and was replaced by Rob Scott and Paul Hurst who dropped Watt from the first team as he went on to only feature in the pair's first match in charge. Following the conclusion of the 2010‚Äì2011 season, he was released. =Dover Athletic= During pre-season Watt had moved south with his family and had joined Dover Athletic on trial, before formally rejecting a contract from Conference National side Gateshead in the interest of not wanting to uproot his family to the north again. On 18 July Watt joined Mansfield Town on trial. He signed for the club on 2 August 2011. =Maidstone United= On 15 February 2013 Watt signed an initial month's loan for Maidstone United, the player dropping down two levels to play for his adopted hometown, making six appearances before signing permanently on 18 March 2013. Watt captained Maidstone to the Isthmian league title in the 2014‚Äì15 season. On 16 November 2015, Watt was released by the club. http://www.kentonline.co.uk/maidstone/sport/watt-released-by-stones-46470/ =Hemel Hempstead Town= Several weeks after being released Watt joined Hemel Hempstead Town making his debut on 1 December 2015 in the second round of the Herts Senior Cup, in a 0‚Äì3 defeat to Bishop's Stortford. His league debut was four days later against Ebbsfleet United, ending in a 1‚Äì2 home defeat.

Antal B√°nhidi was born in Szatm√°rn√©meti, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1920, he fled Romania by swimming across the Szamos river, and arrived in Hungary. He attended the Technical University of Budapest, where he assisted in establishing EMESE, the university's flight club. His piloting and engineering talent were recognized and √Årp√°d Lampich taught him how to design airplanes. In 1929, B√°nhidi flew a Lampich L-2 R√≥ma ultralight plane on a 5,000 kilometer journey to Sweden and back for the annual world meeting of university aviators. The flight included 150 km legs over sea, the plane's 3-cylinder radial engine lacking the usual redundant set of spark magnets. In 1930, Antal B√°nhidi designed the B√°nhidi Gerle, a light, universal, two-seater biplane, which was powered by a 5-cylinder Genet-Major radial engine. The plane was suitable for flight schools, light aerobatics, air touring and sailplane towing. About 15 Gerle aircraft were built in Hungary before the outbreak of World War II. In 1931, B√°nhidi was hired as Chief Technical Advisor for the successful USA - Hungary transatlantic flight of Gy√∂rgy Endresz and S√°ndor Magyar. He chose and prepared a modern Lockheed Sirius 8A plane named \\"Justice for Hungary\\" for the voyage.Justice for Hungary flight During February and March 1933, B√°nhidi and floatplane pilot Tibor Bisits became the first aviators to complete a roundtrip along the Mediterranean Sea. Flying \\"Gerle No. 13\\", it took 100.5 hours of flight time to complete the 12,500 kilometer journey. Due to sour economic effects of the Great Depression, the expedition was only made possible by the offer of free fuel from Shell and the hospitality of Italians in North Africa. B√°nhidi's Gerle was filmed by famous desert aviator L√°szl√≥ Alm√°sy while circling the Great Pyramids without permission. On his return, B√°nhidi wrote and published a book to document the journey. In the autumn of 1933, B√°nhidi made a one-man flight in \\"Gerle No. 13\\" from Debrecen to Finland, Sweden and London, aiming to set a touring record while taking advantage of an offer to have the plane's Genet- Major engine overhauled for free in Coventry. He was able to courier a state medal to Lord Rothermere, a sponsor of the 1931 ocean flight, and then flew to Debrecen non-stop. In 1937 Antal B√°nhidi was invited for a two-month South American expedition, where he flew 15,000 kilometers over uncharted Amazonas territory, documented in another book. On June 26, 1941 Antal B√°nhidi, serving as a national guard reservist pilot at the time, became one of the few eyewitnesses to the mysterious bombing of Kassa. His Fiat CR-42 biplane fighter was too slow to intercept enemy medium bombers, and he was unable to conclusively identify the three attackers from the distance of one kilometer. Blame for the aerial bombing attack was laid on the Soviet Union, and the next day Hungary joined Nazi Germany. After World War II, the USSR banned Hungary from building powered aircraft, thus the ageing Antal B√°nhidi was put aside, working for decades as a blueprints' corrector for ground vehicle designs. After the fall of communism, he was recognized and honored for his achievements by the Hungarian government.

It originally was displayed in an exterior niche of the church, where a copy now stands. Donatello was commissioned by the linen weavers' guild to complete three pieces for the project. St. Mark was the first of his contributions. The niche itself was not of Donatello's hand, but created most probably by two stone carvers named Perfetto di Giovanni and Albizzo di Pietro. Sculpture Donatello's sculpture is notable for its detailed realism, evidence of the artist's skills. Even the veins of St. Mark's left hand are visible as he holds a text upon his hip. or natural pose, is used with Donatello's St. Mark. The saint has more weight on his right leg, his left knee is bent, and his torso is slightly twisted. The style is much more naturalistic than the symmetry and unrealistic nature of art from the Dark Ages. Also Donatello's sculpture differs from medieval works in the way that drapery is used, specifically in that St. Mark's figure is revealed by a realistic draping of linen. According to Renaissance scholar Gene A. Brucker, Donatello's statue of St. Mark \\"is generally recognized as the first Renaissance monument.\\" (Renaissance Florence, 244) Proportions According to Vasari's text The Lives of the Artists, written 140 years after the completion of St. Mark, the linen workers' guild originally rejected the sculpture because it appeared unnatural when set at street level. This was due to proportion adjustments made for its final resting place in the niche, well above street level. The head and torso were made larger as they would be further away from the viewer. The copy viewed at street level Donatello promised to make adjustments, so he covered the statue with a cloth, set the statue in the niche above the street, and without touching the statue for 15 days, once again revealed it to the guild. With its location above the viewer, the proportions looked perfect and the linen weaver's guild accepted the statue.

The Wiikwemkoong Unceded Territory (nicknamed Wiky, previously named Wikwemikong) is the First Nation reserve in the north-eastern section of Manitoulin Island in Manitoulin District, Ontario, Canada. Wiikwemkoong is an unceded Indian reserve in Canada, which means that it has not \\"relinquished title to its land to the government by treaty or otherwise.\\" The local Ojibwe placename is wiikwemkong (Manitoulin dialect; notice the vowel dropping) with the locative -ong ('at') form of wiikwemik 'bay with a gently sloping bottom'.Richard A. Rhodes: Eastern Ojibwa-Chippewa-Ottawa Dictionary, 1985, p. 363. The spelling Wikwemikong is from dialects spoken elsewhere (or in earlier times) that retain the i. The initial element wiikwe- occurs in other forms as 'bay'; the final element -mik cannot be for amik 'beaver' (its local form is mik), a folk etymology that violates the rules for Algonquian stem formation. It can be identified as a variant of the medial element aamik-, which appears, for example, in Southwestern Ojibwe minaamikaa 'there are breakers, shoals, banks (of sand or rocks)',Frederic Baraga 1880 which has initial min- 'islandlike'. The plus or minus of aa- is found in several medial elements in Ojibwe and other Algonquian languages.Ives Goddard, pers. comm. to Carl Masthay, 2016. The reserve's former name was Manitoulin Unceded Indian Reserve. The Wiikwemkoong Band changed it on August 20, 1968 to Wikwemikong Unceded Indian Reserve. The reserve is occupied by Ojibwa, Odawa, and Potawatomi peoples under the Council of Three Fires. The current band chief is Duke Peltier. Geography Wiikwemkoong occupies a large peninsula on the eastern end of Manitoulin Island, which is connected to the rest of the island by an isthmus separating South Bay from Manitowaning Bay. The reserve's primary access is via Wiikwemkoong Way, which continues off the reserve as Cardwell Street and connects to Highway 6 at Manitowaning. The reserve has a land area of 412.97 km¬≤ and is the fifth-largest Indian reserve in Canada by area. It is bordered on its west by Assiginack township, by which the peninsula is connected to the rest of Manitoulin Island. The vast majority of the reserve's border is, however, a water boundary with Northeastern Manitoulin and the Islands, by which it is nearly surrounded except for its border with Assiginack. The Point Grondine Park, located on the mainland near Killarney, also belongs to the Wiikwemkoong band. This area, which has been unpopulated since the Point Grondine band moved to Wiikwemkoong proper in the 1940s,John S. Marsh and Bruce W. Hodgins, Changing Parks: The History, Future and Cultural Context of Parks and Heritage Landscapes. Dundurn Press, 1998. . p. 69. remained unoccupied and virtually unused by the band until the park was established in 2015.\\"First Nation opens new park in northern Ontario\\". CBC Northern Ontario, August 21, 2015. History From 1836 to 1862, a considerable portion of Manitoulin Island was set aside as the \\"Manitoulin Island Indian Reserve\\" under the Bond Head Treaty. The most important of the pre-confederation treaties were the Robinson Treaties because all subsequent treaties were modeled after these. In 1850, William B. Robinson, a government negotiator and former fur trader, proposed that First Nations reserves be created on the Crown Land acquired through treaties. These Reserves were intended to be the answer to what the immigrant settlers needed for land settlement. First Nation peoples would be set apart on reserves from the new settlers. The Robinson-Huron and Robinson-Superior treaties were signed in September 1850 for large territories north of the two Great Lakes. According to written records, Lake Huron and Lake Superior area leaders surrendered nearly 15 000 000 hectares of land and the islands in exchange for the establishment of 24 reserves and a payment of approximately $10 000 to be followed by additional annual payment of $2700. In 1862, most of the islands were again ceded to the government of Canada under the MacDougall Treaty for new settlement by non-natives, resulting in the creation of new reserves at West Bay, Sheguiandah, Sheshegwaning, Cockburn Island and Sucker Creek. However, two bands which occupied the land that now comprises Wiikwemkoong claimed that the bands that signed the Treaty did not represent them, and thus continued to exist as a remnant of the Manitoulin Island Indian Reserve. In 1968, an amalgamation took place among three bands: Manitoulin Island Unceded Indian Reserve, Point Grondine and South Bay. This amalgamation created the Wikwemikong Unceded Indian Reserve. The band filed a claim with the Canadian government on the issue of the jurisdiction of the Wikwemikong islands in 1984, but the government denied that the band had any right to these islands in 1997. The two parties restarted negotiations in 2007. As of 2012, the claim is still ongoing. In 2014 the Constitution ‚Äì Wiikwemkoong G'chi Naaknigewin was ratified, subsequently changing the name to Wiikwemkoong Unceded Territory. Communities In addition to the primary settlement at Wiikwemkoong, smaller settlements on the reserve include Buzwah, Kaboni, Murray Hill, South Bay, Two O'Clock, Wabozominissing and Wikwemikonsing. The reserve is served by four churches: * Holy Cross Church * Buzwah Church (Saint Ignatius) * Kaboni Catholic Church (St. Anthony Daniel Parish) * South Bay Catholic Church (Our Lady of Grace) There are two elementary school, Wasse Abin Junior School (JK, SK, Grades 1-4) and Wasse Abin Pontiac School (Grades 5-8) and Wasse Abin High School. Two health clinics provide basic services: * Nadmadwin Mental Health Clinic * Wiikwemkoong Health Centre Transportation Wiikwemkoong Way is the key route in the communities and connects with Ontario Highway 6. The closest airport is Manitowaning/Manitoulin East Municipal Airport in Manitowaning, Ontario. There is no commercial service from this airport. Ontario Northland operates a twice daily bus that connects to other places on Manitouland Island as well as the nearest major city, Sudbury, Ontario. Culture The reserve is also home to the Wiikwemkoong Cultural Festival (Wiikwemkoong Pow-Wow) which is held annually every Civic Holiday weekend (first weekend in August). This annual event is touted as the largest and oldest pow-wow in Eastern Canada. Considered to be one of the major pow wows in North America, it is attended by many aboriginal dancers who participate in competition of all age ranges, demonstrating traditional, grass, jingle and fancy dancing. Wiikwemkoong is also home to a professional theatre company, De-ba-jeh-mu-jig Theatre Group, which stages and produces plays about First Nations life and culture, within the missions ruins next to Holy Cross Church.

The parish includes the villages of Morgan's Vale and Woodfalls immediately west and southwest of Redlynch; the village of Lover, southeast of Redlynch; and the hamlet of Bohemia, south of Lover. Much of the parish lies within the boundaries of the New Forest National Park. The River Blackwater rises near Lover and flows east through the parish towards Landford and Hampshire, where it joins the Test.  History  The earliest settlement was at Pensworth, north of Grove Copse and northwest of the present Redlynch, in the 12th or 13th centuries. This village had declined by the 15th century and in the 20th century the name survived only as Upper Pensworth Farm. In the 18th century settlement was along roads and the edges of commons. Settlement increased in the 19th century, at Redlynch and at Warminster Green (called Lover since 1876) where the church and school were built. Redlynch was home to the clockmaker Peter Bower (1715/21 ‚Äì 1795) who resided close to the site now known as Bowers Hill. =Redlynch House= Redlynch House, built by John Bailey (d. pre-1822), was acquired at some time before 1833, with its 25 acre park, by Rev. William Nelson, 1st Earl Nelson (1757-1835) (elder brother and heir of Admiral Horatio Nelson) of nearby Trafalgar Park, Wiltshire, as a residence for his son-in-law Samuel Hood, 2nd Baron Bridport,A P Baggs, Elizabeth Crittall, Jane Freeman and Janet H Stevenson, 'Parishes: Downton', in A History of the County of Wiltshire: Volume 11, Downton Hundred; Elstub and Everleigh Hundred, ed. D A Crowley (London, 1980), pp. 19-77 also of Cricket House, Cricket St Thomas in Somerset.  Religious sites  Redlynch parish church of Saint Mary at Lover is a yellow brick buildingPevsner & Cherry, 1975, page 381 dating from 1837. Originally part of Downton parish, a separate ecclesiastical district was created for the church in 1841. The vicarage was the childhood home of Bernard Walke who served as an Anglican priest in three Cornish parishes.Walke, B. (2002) Twenty Years at St Hilary. Mount Hawke: Truran; pp. 11‚Äì12, 190 The Church of St Birinus at Morgan's Vale was built as a chapel of ease to Downton in 1894‚Äì96. It is a red brick Gothic Revival building with stone dressings and Perpendicular Gothic style windows. It was designed by the Gothic Revival architect C. E. Ponting of Marlborough in the style of his architectural contemporary W. D. Caroe. The benefices of the two churches were combined in 1968; as of 2016 the incumbent resides at Downton. Woodfalls Methodist Church was built in 1874 by the Primitive Methodists and joined the Salisbury Methodist Circuit in the 1940s.  Notable buildings  Newhouse, east of Redlynch on the road towards Whiteparish, was built c. 1619. The house and estate were bought in 1633 by Giles Eyre (father of Sir Giles Eyre, member of Parliament and judge) and continue to be held by his descendants. The house is constructed from English bonded brick with limestone dressings and has a distinctive Y-shaped plan; it was designated as Grade I listed in 1960. There is an early 18th-century granary and two stable blocks, from 1750 and the late 19th. Governance The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which performs most significant local government functions. Redlynch was formerly part of the parish of Downton. It became a separate civil parish in 1896, then was extended in 1934 to include the former parish of Morgan's Vale and Woodfalls (which had separated from Downton in 1923), and Nomansland. A community governance review effective 1 April 2017 transferred the eastern portion of Redlynch parish to Landford. The area transferred includes the settlements of Nomansland and Hamptworth. The parish is part of Redlynch and Landford electoral ward which stretches east from Redlynch to Landford. The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 4,719.  Amenities  Morgan's Vale and Woodfalls CE Primary School serves Morgan's Vale, Woodfalls, Lover and Redlynch; it was built as a National School in 1869, next to St Birinus' church. Redlynch Village Hall is near the church at Lover. Built in 1922 as the church hall, it was modernised in the early 21st century. The parish has two pubs: the Kings Head at Redlynch and the Wodfalls Inn at Woodfalls.

In November 2009 journalist Andrew Revkin described it in The New York Times as \\"a popular skeptics‚Äô blog\\" run by McIntyre, a retired Canadian mining consultant. In 2010, a Nature article described the site as part of the \\"climate change skeptic community\\" alongside the Air Vent and Black¬¨board. Founding In 2004 Stephen McIntyre blogged on his website climate2003.com about his efforts with Ross McKitrick to get an extended analysis of the hockey stick graph into the journal Nature.Pearce, Fred, The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming, (2010) Guardian Books, , pp. 93‚Äì96., On 25 October 2004 McIntyre posted comments on climate2003.com about a piece by William Connolley circulated on various blogs, and on 26 October wrote, \\"Maybe I‚Äôll start blogging some odds and ends that I‚Äôm working on. I‚Äôm going to post up some more observations on some of the blog criticisms.\\" On 1 December Michael E. Mann and nine other scientists launched the RealClimate website as \\"a resource where the public can go to see what actual scientists working in the field have to say about the latest issues.\\" On climate2003.com McIntyre noted this development in a blog post on 10 December, where he wrote \\"Mann and some of his colleagues have set up a blog at the above address. A couple of Mann's first postings have been arguments against our papers. I'll post up a two quick comments below.\\" On 2 February 2005 McIntyre set up his Climate Audit blog, having found difficulties with posting comments on the climate2003.com layout. Judith Curry of the Georgia Institute of Technology has said \\"McIntyre started the blog climateaudit.org so that he could defend himself against claims being made at the blog Realclimate with regards to his critique of the ‚Äúhockey stick‚Äù since he was unable to post his comments there\\". She has also referred to this site as one of several \\"Climate Auditor\\" websites. Climatic Research Unit information requests and email controversy After the UK Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) came into effect in 2005, Climate Audit readers were asked to make FOI requests to the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia (UEA) for the raw data from weather stations used in developing instrumental temperature record datasets, for copies of agreements under which the raw data was obtained from meteorology institutions, and also for email correspondence relating to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. On 12 August 2009, Olive Heffernan wrote in naturenews that \\"Since 2002, Steve McIntyre, the editor of Climate Audit, a blog that investigates the statistical methods used in climate science, has repeatedly asked Phil Jones, director of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia, UK, for access to monthly global surface temperature data held by the institute. But in recent weeks, Jones has been swamped by a sudden surge in demands for data\\". She described how CRU had received 58 FOIA requests between 24 and 29 July 2009 from McIntyre or others associated with the blog. The raw data was restricted to academics, and the unit's director Phil Jones said that the data was subject to confidentiality agreements with various governments, but he was seeking agreement to get the raw data available online. He said that ‚ÄúData release needs to be done in a systematic way.‚Äù The site was one of the first to receive word of the e-mails which had been leaked from the University of East Anglia with Jonathan Leake of The Times writing, \\"The storm began with just four cryptic words. 'A miracle has happened,' announced a contributor to Climate Audit, a website devoted to criticising the science of climate change.\\" Louise Gray wrote in The Daily Telegraph, \\"Climate Audit was one of the first to post up the stolen emails from the University of East Anglia that led to the 'climategate' scandal\\". Bloomberg said of the controversy, \\"Web sites and blogs including the Climate Audit Mirror Site have carried copies of e-mails, correspondence between climatologists and commentary. In one e-mail cited widely on blogs including Climate Audit, Phil Jones writes about completing ‚ÄúMike‚Äôs nature trick of adding in the real temps‚Äù in order to hide the decline.\\" According to Antonio Regalado writing in Science Insider, Jones wrote e-mails stating that he convinced the university's FOI managers to not release data to \\"greenhouse skeptics\\" because Jones believed that they planned to harm the UAE or setback climate science by drawing scientists into disputes, wasting research time. \\"Think I've managed to persuade UEA to ignore all further FOIA requests if the people have anything to do with Climate Audit,\\" Jones wrote in 2007. The House of Commons' Science and Technology Committee largely vindicated the scientists involved in the scandal, but left consideration of the quality of the science and the conduct of the research to committees chaired by Lord Oxburgh and Sir Muir Russell. Fox News said that McIntyre \\"who also worked at the IPCC and submitted notes to the Science and Technology Committee for its investigation, wrote a lengthy rebuttal of the decision on his blog\\", and disputed the committee's conclusion that the word trick \\"appears to be a colloquialism for a 'neat' method of handling data\\". Further investigations by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Inspector General of the United States Department of Commerce and the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the National Science Foundation reaffirmed that the accusations against the scientists were unfounded. Reception James Hansen, the former director of NASA's Goddard Institute, has dismissed McIntyre as a \\"court jester\\".Global warming's most dangerous apostate speaks out about the state of climate change science. by Anne Jolis, The Wall Street Journal, Nov. 18, 2009 \\"If a single person can be credited with setting the stage for Climategate, it's Stephen McIntyre, the retired mining consultant behind the popular skeptic blog Climate Audit,\\" wrote Kate Sheppard at Mother Jones in 2011.Climategate: What Really Happened?, Mother Jones, Apr. 21, 2011 \\"Emails from this period show the scientists lashing out against McIntyre.

He likes to 'tease these guys and kind of make fun of them,' he says, and their evident aggravation at his inquiries only egged him on. 'I think it was a mistake for them to in effect adopt a fatwa against Climate Audit,' says McIntyre.\\" Patrick J. Michaels, a former contributor to the IPCC, named Climate Audit as part of 'a new ‚Äúparallel universe‚Äù of emerging online publications, manned by serious scientists critical of world governments approach to climate change'. ‚ÄúA parallel universe is assembling itself parallel to the IPCC.

He later took Irish citizenship and became professor of sculpture at the Royal Hibernian Academy. Early career Goulet was born in Saint-Nazaire. Before World War II, he was a member of the Breton National Party, and a former member of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO). His artistic career began at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts, where he studied art and architecture, and learned sculpture with Auguste Rodin's assistant, Charles Despiau. His works in France include bas-reliefs shown at the Exposition International de Paris (1938), and the monument to the youth of the French empire in Lille (1939). He was part of the Breton artistic movement Seiz Breur. Goulet's involvement in Breton nationalism led to accusations that he had orchestrated the destruction the Monument to the Breton-Angevin Federation at Pontivy on 18 December 1938 by Gwenn ha du, the nationalist terrorist group. He was detained, but then released. World War II =French army= In 1939, he was sent to Strasbourg to study the art of sabotage. He participated in the beginning of World War II fighting for France, and was captured by the Germans on 11 June 1940 while blowing up a bridge on the Aisne with friends from a French corps. =Bagadou Stourm= Later in the war, he joined the assault section of Bagadou Stourm, Breton nationalist stormtroopers allied to the Germans. He also collaborated with the pro-Nazi nationalist newspaper L'Heure Bretonne. In 1941 in Paris, he became head of Bagadou Stourm and the \\"Youth Organizations\\" of the Parti National Breton. The promotion of Bagadou Stourm officers was named \\"Patrick Pearse\\" to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising against British rule in Ireland.

I. Nikitin (–ì. –ò. –ù–∏–∫–∏—Ç–∏–Ω), Y. S. Sokolov (–Æ. –ú. –°–æ–∫–æ–ª–æ–≤) and V. I. Volkov (–í. –ò. –í–æ–ª–∫–æ–≤). It was designed to replace the DShK machine gun and was adopted by the Soviet Army in 1971. It is no longer being produced in Russia; the manufacturing license for the NSV ended up in Kazakhstan after the break-up of the Soviet Union. The NSV has been manufactured in Bulgaria, India, Poland and Yugoslavia under license. The NSV weighs , has a rate of fire of 700‚Äì800 rounds per minute, and an effective range from to against airborne and ground targets, respectively. A loaded ammunition belt with 50 rounds weighs . The NSVT version is used on the T-72, T-64 and T-80 tanks. The new Kord machine gun has replaced worn-out NSVs. History The Soviet Army began looking for a new heavy machine gun to replace its older SGM and DShK machine guns in the early 1950s. The Soviet Army liked the idea behind the German MG 42; a versatile weapon used on a variety of mounts to perform many different roles. Two Soviet weapon designers were asked to design one weapon each utilizing the same principle. Testing approved Mikhail Kalashnikov's solution; it was found to be more reliable and cheaper to manufacture than the design of Grigory Nikitin and Yuri Sokolov. Kalashnikov's machine gun became the new standard machine gun, and was named PK. Nikitin's and Sokolov's design was however not forgotten. It was developed into the heavy NSV machine gun about 10 years later and selected in 1969 as the successor to the DShK/DShKM machine gun. It was accepted in service by the Soviet Army in 1971. The machine gun was also license-manufactured in Bulgaria, India, Yugoslavia and Poland. The Yugoslavian version of the NSVT is called the M87. Production of the NSV has ended in Russia, and it is currently being replaced by the Kord heavy machine gun. The Russian Army needed a more accurate heavy machine gun, and it has also been increasingly difficult to get hold of spare parts. NSV production was located in Ukraine and in Kazakhstan and was disrupted by the end of the Soviet Union. Use in Finland The NSV is called 12,7 Itkk 96 or 12,7 ilmatorjuntakonekiv√§√§ri 96 (12,7 anti-aircraft machine gun 96) in Finland. It is often used as a vehicle-mounted machine gun, and can be seen on the Pasi armoured personnel carrier, the Nasu transport vehicle and the Leopard 2R tank. Due to its high rate of fire, the NSV is intended to be used as a close-range anti-aircraft weapon against helicopters, UAVs and aircraft. In dismounted ground combat it is placed on a special mount. The Finnish Navy also uses the NSV in the anti-aircraft role, where it complements other unguided anti-aircraft weapons like the 23 ITK 95, Bofors 40 Mk3 or Bofors 57 Mk2 and Mk3.

History CCM was first published in July 1978, as a printed magazine. It has been owned by Salem since 1999. On January 16, 2008, Salem announced that the April 2008 issue would be the final printed issue of the magazine. When the magazine was first published, it was called Contemporary Christian Music and covered that music genre. The name was later shortened to CCM, which was still an acronym for \\"Contemporary Christian Music\\". For a short time, the magazine changed its name to Contemporary Christian Magazine (keeping the \\"CCM\\" but broadening the scope) but then ultimately went back to Contemporary Christian Music (CCM). Then in May 2007, the name's meaning was changed to \\"Christ. Community. Music.\\" The editor explained that the term \\"contemporary Christian music\\" was dated and marginalizing and that Christ, community, and music are three entirely different things ‚Äî thus, the periods after each word of the acronym to show that they are not related. The editor's explanation of the name change can be found in the May 2007 issue of the magazine. In October 2006, CCM launched its own social networking site, MyCCM. Since its start, CCM has covered musical artists that mix spiritual themes with their music, including Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, T Bone Burnett, Victoria Williams, The Call, Sam Phillips, U2 and Bruce Cockburn, as well as more mainstream Christian radio artists such as Amy Grant, Larry Norman, Michael W. Smith, Steven Curtis Chapman, Benny Hester, Steve Taylor, Phil Keaggy and Randy Stonehill. In the 1980s, CCM also focused on some of the more obscure spiritual artists coming out of the Southern California punk rock and new wave music scene like the 77s, Daniel Amos, Undercover, Altar Boys, Crumb√§cher, the Choir, Adam Again, and others. However, as the 1990s rolled around, the magazine focused more and more on artists that were heavily played on Christian radio. Online publication On July 8, 2009, Salem announced that CCM Magazine will be re- launched as an online publication, released four times a year. The online concept has been further developed and the online magazine is issued twice each month usually on the 1st and 15th of each month. The CCM Update In 1983, CCM Magazine spun off its contemporary Christian music industry analysis and charts into a new publication, The CCM Update (originally known as MusicLine and later MusicLine Update). While the new magazine focused on the contemporary Christian music industry-related content that was previously included in CCM Magazine, CCM Magazine retained the consumer-related content. The CCM Update published charts until its closure.http://www.meiea.org/resources/Proceedings/2018/MEIEA%20Summit%202018%20Mall.pdf At the time of its closure, the magazine published Christian album charts as well as four radio charts: adult contemporary, Christian hit radio/Pop, Inspirational/Praise, and Rock. It had previously published a Christian country radio charthttp://media.sbhla.org.s3.amazonaws.com/7898,27-Dec-1994.pdf as well as southern gospel, black gospel, and metal charts. The CCM Update folded on April 15, 2002, with its feature content being incorporated into a full-page column in Radio & Records, also called The CCM Update. It also stopped publishing charts, leaving Radio & Records as the major chart publisher in the Christian music industry; according to the James Cumbee, the president of Salem Communications, they felt that continuing to publish charts was a conflict of interest, as Salem owned many of the radio stations that reported to the charts.

He is noted for his Orientalist photographs and for being one of the first war photographers. Life and career S√ºleymaniye Mosque in Constantinople, photograph by Robertson, 1853 Robertson was born in Middlesex in 1813. He trained as an engraver under Wyon (probably William Wyon). In 1841, he settled in Constantinople where he worked as an \\"engraver and die-stamper\\" at the Imperial Ottoman Mint. During this period, he appears to have become interested in photography.Benaki Museum, \\"James Robertson\\" [Biographical Notes], Online: http://www.benaki.gr/index.asp?id=1020101‚ü®=en By the 1850s, tourist travel to Near East created strong demand for photographs as souvenirs. A small group of early photographers, mostly of French origin, made their way to Egypt and Constantinople to capitalise on this demand. These pioneering photographers included F√©lix Bonfils (1831-1885); Gustave Le Gray (1820-1884), brothers Henri and Emile Bechard; the British-Italian brothers, Antonio Beato (c. 1832‚Äì1906) and Felice Beato (1832‚Äì1909), and the Greek Zangaki brothers. Many of these photographers were in Egypt at the same time, and some, including Robertson, formed partnerships.Jacobson, K., Odalisques and Arabesques: Orientalist Photography, 1839-1925, London, Bernard Quaritch, 2007, p. 277. In 1853 Robertson began photographing with the British-Italian photographer Felice Beato and the two formed a partnership called Robertson & Beato either in that year or in 1854 when Robertson opened a photographic studio in Pera, Constantinople. Robertson and Beato were joined by Beato's brother, Antonio on photographic expeditions to Malta in 1854 or 1856 and to Greece and Jerusalem in 1857. A number of the firm's photographs produced in the 1850s are signed Robertson, Beato and Co. and it is believed that \\"and Co.\\" refers to Antonio.Hannavy, J., Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography, Routledge, 2013, p. 1200-1201 In late 1854 or early 1855 Robertson married the Beato brothers' sister, Leonilda Maria Matilda Beato. The couple had three daughters, Catherine Grace (born in 1856), Edith Marcon Vergence (born in 1859) and Helen Beatruc (born in 1861). In 1855 Robertson along with Felice Beato, Charles Langlois and Karl Baptiste van Szatmari travelled to Balaklava, Crimea where they photographed the closing stages of the Crimean War. (They had replaced the previous photographer, Roger Fenton.) They photographed the fall of Sevastopol in September 1855. Of all the photographs produced, at least 60 made by Robertson are the best known.Hannavy, J., Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography, Routledge, 2013, p. 1468 It was Robertson's work in Crimea that would earn him the reputation as the world's \\"first war photographer.\\"Khroundina, V., \\"Robertson of Constantinople,\\" Cornucopia Magazine, 11 January, 2014 Online: http://www.cornucopia.net/blog/robertson-of-constantinople/ In around 1857 both Robertson and Felice Beato went to Calcutta in India to photograph the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion.Hannavy, J., Encyclopedia of Nineteenth- Century Photography, Routledge, 2013, p. 1428. It may be worth noting that some sources claim that Beato travelled alone to Calcutta. Robertson also produced photographs in Palestine, Syria, Malta, and Cairo with either or both of the Beato brothers.Hannavy, J., Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography, Routledge, 2013, p. 1201-1202 In the late 1850s, Robertson produced a number of water-colours with popular Orientalist themes such as carpet-sellers and snake charmers. It is unclear whether he painted these, or overpainted photographs with a soft, water-colour wash. In 1860, after Felice Beato left for China to photograph the Second Opium War and Antonio Beato went to Egypt, Robertson briefly teamed up with Charles Shepherd back in Constantinople. The firm of Robertson & Beato was dissolved in 1867, having produced images - including remarkable multiple-print panoramas - of Malta, Greece, Turkey, Damascus, Jerusalem, Egypt, the Crimea and India. Robertson possibly gave up photography in the 1860s; he returned to work as an engraver at the Imperial Ottoman Mint until his retirement in 1881. In that year he left for Yokohama, Japan, arriving in January 1882. He died there in April 1888.

The name derives from the ancient Noricum province of the Roman Empire on the territory of present-day Austria and the adjacent Bavarian and Slovenian area.  Concept history  Referring to extinct Noricum, the designation originally comprised the Alpine mountain ranges in the medieval Bavarian stem duchy of East Francia, including the later Tyrol, Salzburg and Upper Austrian regions. In the 19th century, the German term Norische Alpen covered the whole group of ranges of the Central Eastern and Northern Limestone Alps east of the Dreiherrnspitze peak.Alpen. In: Heinrich August Pierer, Julius L√∂be (Hrsg.): Universal-Lexikon der Gegenwart und Vergangenheit. 4. Auflage. Band 1. Altenburg 1857, S. 349‚Äì351 (zeno.org). The Noric Alps were considered the major northern range of the Eastern Alps, alongside the Carnic Alps (i.e. the Carnic Alps proper, Gailtal Alps, Karawanks, Kamnik‚ÄìSavinja Alps, and Pohorje) in the south and the Julian Alps in the southeast. Later the meaning was confined to the ranges south of the Alpine divide between the Mur and Drava rivers  Geography  Mt. Eisenhut In the traditional context, the Noric Alps are located mostly in Austria ‚Äî 98% of the region is Austrian, mainly in the southern states of Carinthia and Styria‚Äî, with a small area in the adjacent Lower Styria region of Slovenia. The area covers and stretches from the upper Mur River in the North to the Drava in the South and from the Katschberg Pass in the West to the Mur River in the East. The Noric Alps are surrounded by the Hohe Tauern range in the West and the Low Tauern in the North, in the South they border on the Gailtal Alps, the Karavanke and Pohorje ranges of the Southern Limestone Alps. The highest point is Mt. Eisenhut in Styria, which, at , is only modest in the context of the Eastern Alps, where many mountains rise above 3000m (10,000 ft). Other notable peaks in the range are Rosennock (), Zirbitzkogel () and Gro√üer Speikkogel (). In the south the Noric Alps comprise the Klagenfurt Basin with the historic centres of Zollfeld and Magdalensberg. The mountainside is characterised by transhumance (Alm) agriculture and was also a mining area, still for magnesite in the area of Radenthein. Today the region largely depends on tourism, in winter around the ski aras of Bad Kleinkirchheim, Krems, at Katschberg, Turracher H√∂he and Klippitzt√∂rl, in summer around several picturesque Carinthian lakes like W√∂rthersee, Lake Millstatt or Lake Ossiach. The Nock Mountain National Park, accessible via the Nockalmstra√üe scenic road, is a protected landscape according to IUCN V category. The Norian Age in the Triassic Period of geological time is named for the Noric Alps  Classification  Rosennock summit The Italian Partizione delle Alpi classification of 1926 referred to the Alpi Noriche as the mountain chain from the Mur in the East up to the Brenner Pass in the West, including High and Low Tauern as well as Tux and Zillertal Alps. According to the Alpine Club classification, the Noric Alps are divided into *the Gurktal Alps in the west, with the highest peaks in the Nock Mountains (Nockberge) region, and *the Lavanttal Alps up to the Mur River in the east, including the Po√üruck/Kozjak range and Radl Pass at the Austrian-Slovene border in the south separated by the Neumarkt Pass. The Noric Alps roughly correspond to the Carinthian-Styrian Alps according to the recent unofficial SOIUSA classification.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 30, 1999. The episode features Peter's devoutly religious, recently retired father Francis coming to visit, though he is intolerant of the others and makes life miserable for the rest of the Griffin family. Peter tries to bond with him, since Francis had always been neglectful, and when all else fails, he resorts to kidnapping the Pope to settle their conflict. Plot summary Peter Griffin's devoutly Catholic father Francis is forced to retire from his job at the Pawtucket Mill, and moves in with him, though this brings trouble since he attacks Peter's wife Lois for being Protestant. Francis yells at his elder grandson, Chris, because he believes that he is masturbating in the bathroom when he is merely defecating. He makes his granddaughter, Meg, feel guilty for holding hands with a neighbor boy, and tells his younger grandson, Stewie, bedtime stories of the punishments that await sinners in Hell. Francis and his teachings to his grandchildren cause Chris to become convinced that defecation is a sin, while it makes Stewie become fascinated with God and his power to punish sinners. Francis is bored by retirement and is soon hired at the Happy- Go-Lucky Toy Factory where Peter works; thanks to his excellent proficiency he is made foreman of the factory and fires Peter. Francis tells Peter he is a failure as a worker and a father, with this Peter gets tired of trying to please his father and at first does not know what to do, but then sees on the news that the Pope is visiting Boston. Peter decides to drive to Boston and \\"kidnap\\" the Pope so that he could tell Francis what a good father and person he is. Peter takes the Pope to his house; when Lois sees him she is terrified that Peter kidnapped him. Although he kidnapped him, the Pope agrees to tell Francis what a good person Peter is. Before they go, Peter fixes the problems Francis had created for his grandchildren; he tells Chris that what happens in the bathroom is between him and God, and to Meg that it is okay at her age to go out with boys, and tells Stewie about how loving God is. Peter takes the Pope to the toy factory, where he tells Francis that Peter is a good man and father. After hearing this Francis accuses the Pope of being soft; the Pope takes great offense at Francis's claim and starts yelling at him, threatening to excommunicate him. Peter intervenes, and when he reveals he wanted his father's love, Francis says that albeit he does not like Peter's personality, he loves his son, and Peter reconciles with his father. Francis is forgiven by the Pope and is hired for a job as a security guard for his tour of the United States. At the end of the episode, Peter's mother shows up at the door and wishes to live with the family, prompting them to jump in an escape pod. Production Mike Henry acted as a staff writer for this episode. \\"Holy Crap\\" was written by Danny Smith and directed by Neil Affleck. To help Smith were voice actor Mike Henry and Andrew Gormley who acted as staff writers for the episode, while Ricky Blitt, Chris Sheridan and Neil Goldman acted as story editors. To help Affleck direct were supervising directors Peter Shin and Roy Allen Smith. The episode introduced the character, Francis Griffin, Peter's obsessively devout Irish Catholic father. Francis would return in future episodes of the series such as \\"The Father, the Son, and the Holy Fonz,\\" \\"Peter's Two Dads\\" and \\"Family Goy\\". In the episode and his subsequent appearances he is voiced by Charles Durning. In an interview for UGO, Seth MacFarlane commented that he felt this episode was one of the edgiest episodes that the show had produced at the time. In reference to the season 3 episode \\"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein\\", which was originally not broadcast on the Fox network because the producers thought it would be too offensive, MacFarlane said that \\"The episode we did with the Pope, I think, was a lot more offensive to Catholics than the Weinstein was to Jews. I think more of it had to do with internal politics\\". In addition to the regular cast, drummer Andrew Gormley, voice actress Olivia Hack, actor Dwight Schultz and actress Florence Stanley guest starred. Recurring guest voice actress Lori Alan and writer David Zuckerman also made minor appearances. This is the last episode of the show to feature the voice of Lacey Chabert as Meg Griffin. Cultural references The episode revolves around Peter kidnapping the Pope. Rosie O'Donnell and the 1992 movie A League of Their Own, which she starred in were referenced in the episode. While the Griffins are watching television a commercial for the advertising campaign Got Milk? is shown. In a cutaway Peter goes to Hell and sees Adolf Hitler, Al Capone, John Wilkes Booth, and Superman. When Peter realizes he raises a good family and doesn't care what his father thinks, he tells The Scarecrow and Tin Woodsman from The Wizard of Oz that they always had what they wanted. The episode features a parody of the opening of The Dick Van Dyke Show where Rob Petrie (Dick Van Dyke) falls over an ottoman. In the parody, Petrie has a series of progressively more serious and dangerous accidents, until someone finally turns the TV off. Reception Ahsan Haque of IGN rated the episode a 7.9 out of a possible 10, saying \\"As a whole, this episode was definitely an entertaining outing, but it's definitely not an unforgettable classic like some of the earlier episodes\\" and that \\"the majority of random jokes in this episode were simply not as funny they could have been. That being said, there are a couple of shock-worthy gems here that would make even the most jaded viewer smile\\".

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a member of the Conservative Party from 1903 to 1915, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Rodmond Roblin. Howden was born in Milton, Canada West (now Ontario), the son of Robert Howden, and was educated at St. Catharines. In 1882, Howden came to Winnipeg where he trained as a lawyer and was called to the Manitoba bar in 1887. He practised as a barrister. In 1891, Howden moved to Neepawa. He married Barbara McIntosh in 1894. Howden served as mayor of Neepawa from 1900 to 1904. He also owned farms in the province and was president of the King Edward Hotel Company. In religion, Howden was a Methodist. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by-election held on December 2, 1903, in the constituency of Beautiful Plains. Howden ran to replace the late Conservative cabinet minister John Andrew Davidson and was elected without opposition. He initially served as a backbench supporter of Roblin's ministry. He was re-elected over Liberal Alexander Dunlop by 112 votes in the 1907 election, and was named to cabinet on March 16, 1907 as Railway Commissioner. He was reassigned as Minister of Telephones and Telegraphs on March 4, 1908, and was also named Provincial Secretary on November 6, 1908. Howden was returned by acclamation in the 1910 provincial election, and was promoted to Attorney General on October 11, 1911. He also retained responsibility for Telephones and Telegraphs. He defeated Liberal candidate William Wood by thirty-two votes in the 1914 election, and kept both of his portfolios in the legislative sitting which followed. The Roblin administration was forced to resign in early 1915, after a commission of enquiry established by the Lieutenant Governor concluded that the government was guilty of corruption in the tendering of contracts for new legislative buildings. Howden resigned from office on May 12, 1915, and did not seek re- election in the campaign that followed. The commission report concluded that Roblin, Attorney General James H. Howden and developer Thomas Kelly had conspired to commit fraud in the contract arrangements. Howden was indicted, but was eventually discharged of criminal responsibility. He died suddenly at a family reunion at Wasagaming.

Prosopis alba is a South American tree species that grows in central Argentina, the Gran Chaco ecoregion, and part of the Argentine Mesopotamia, as well as Bolivia, Paraguay, and Peru. It is known as algarrobo blanco in Spanish, which means \\"white carob tree\\". Spanish settlers gave it that name because of its similarity to the European carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua). Other common names come from Guaran√≠, including ibop√© and igop√©. Prosopis alba is a medium-sized tree, measuring between , in height and in diameter, though such tall specimens occur very rarely at present. The trunk is short and the treetop is globular, sometimes reaching in diameter. The bark is thin, brown- grayish in colour, with streaks, and it has tanning properties. The tree is employed for ornamental and utilitary roadside planting and windbreaks. Its timber, which is rather dense (relative density = 0.76) and difficult to work, is used for doors and floors, for furniture, for paving blocks, shoe lasts and wine casks (where it replaces the European oak). The wood responds well to drying and is therefore valuable for work that requires stable dimensions regardless of humidity. It is also durable for outdoor use. The flowers are small, greenish-white or yellowish, and bisexual. Pollination, mediated by wind and insects, is allogamous (crossed), since the female reproductive organs are turned active before the male ones. The fruits are modified seedpods, long, with brown seeds about long. They contain a sweet floury paste (patay), very high in energy, that can be used for fodder or turned into flour for human consumption. In the 1940s a mildly intoxicating beverage called aloja was made from it through fermentation; in turn it was sometimes distilled to produce ethanol. Between half and three quarters of the fruit's weight is sugar. In a Botanical garden i◊û Israel The tree can reportedly tolerate drought, salt and sand; in fact, it is extremely efficient with regards to water consumption, it produces the most fruits in years of drought and has been successfully introduced in arid terrains. However, it cannot stand even mild frost. P. alba and other algarrobo species in genus Prosopis, such as algarrobo negro (P. nigra), are often confused or not correctly distinguished in botanical literature; in part this is due to the ease of hybridization of the genus.

History The original village of Crossmyloof was situated in the north-western corner of Cathcart parish and was formed around the junction of what are now Pollokshaws Road and Langside Avenue (the road to Cathcart). Crossmyloof was a small hamlet which suddenly grew in prominence when Neale Thomson opened a large bakery there in 1847. Some remnants of this industrial past still endure. A bakery building behind the tenement known as Camphill Gate on Pollokshaws Road still stands, and there is still a road named Baker Street, where once stood the Alexander \\"Greek\\" Thomson-designed workers' cottages. The main street in Crossmyloof was Cathcart Place, which is now part of Pollokshaws Road between the Langside Avenue/Minard Road junction and Shawlands Cross at the junction with Kilmarnock Road and Moss-side Road. A pub has occupied the Langside Avenue corner from the early 19th century: the Corona Bar, built there in 1912, carries a claim to have been established in 1817. Crossmyloof was little more than the main street until the late Victorian era, when Minard Road was opened up and the area around Waverley Gardens was built. For twenty years the tenements in Norham Street and Frankfort Street looked out on open countryside, dotted with ancient cottages, separating them from the Waverley Park area of Shawlands until the Waverley Scheme was constructed by Glasgow Corporation on the land opened up when Moss-side Road was formed to build Shawlands Academy. In 1818 Crossmyloof was described as the most populous village in Cathcart parish. Although till recently \\"remarkable chiefly for being a resort of vagrants\\", the writer was happy to report that the village had now become more respectable from an increase in the number of its inhabitants, who now amounted to around 500. The remarks were a little premature, because in November 1820 two members of a band of armed ruffians who robbed a house in Crossmyloof were hanged in front of the Jail in the Saltmarket. The attack took place at the home of Dr Robert Watt, the author of the four volume Bibliotheca Britannica, who had died, allegedly of overwork, the previous year. His terrified widow had a pistol held at her head and her gold rings wrenched off her fingers. She is reported as having hastily left Crossmyloof for the safety of a home in Hutchesontown. When the Rev James Smith wrote his account of Cathcart parish in 1840, he used the name Westfield for the village and gave the number of families as 124 and the total population as 587 persons. At this period the villagers were mostly cotton handloom weavers. The only remaining woollen weaver was William AIgie, assisted by his seven children, three of whom wove woollen cloth, and four of whom worked in cotton. Two elderly women, Mary Sinclair, a muslin flowerer, and Margaret Wotherspoon, a muslin tambourer, were probably the last of the skilled embroideresses in the village. There were also a few shopkeepers, a blacksmith, several brassfounders and tinsmiths and William Ferguson, a lithographic engraver. By 1851 the population had risen sharply to 939 persons. The rise was accounted for by the establishment of the Crossmyloof Bakery in 1847 by Neale Thomson of Camphill. The following year James Muirhead moved his Cart Forge from its original site in the Skin Mill Yard at Pollokshaws to larger premises at Crossmyloof, where he produced axles for railway wagons. The Cart Forge was situated between Baker Street, where Thomson's workforce was housed, and the Pollokshaws Road. Although most of the villagers lived along the Pollokshaws Road there was another small community in the area between Titwood Road and Moss-side Road. This area was known as Langside Valley and contained a few villas and cottages and several orchards and nurseries. This was where Glaswegians came in the Summer to enjoy fresh air and healthy surroundings. An advertisement in the Glasgow Courier of 25 February 1802 offers two \\"neat\\" lodgings at the village of Westfield for renting as summer quarters for \\"genteel families\\" from the city, who would find the houses well adapted for their use with the convenience of good water and a \\"neat\\" plot of ground. The villa owners included James Smellie, a retired cooper who occupied the house called Langside Valley, and William Jaffrey, an accountant and notary public and owner of Campvale House. Springhill House was the residence of Henry Murphy, a pawnbroker and hat manufacturer in the Bridgegate. The house later became Springhill Academy with William Cairns and William Christie as joint headmasters. Archibald McAuslan was the local surgeon and physician, and the community included a group of customs officers with the titles of outdoor officer, running officer, clerk, weigher and locker. When Hugh MacDonald passed through Crossmyloof on one of his Rambles in 1851, he found that the weavers of Crossmyloof and Strathbungo, like their neighbours on the hill above at Langside, were \\"celebrated growers of tulips, pansies, dahlias and other floricultural favourites\\" and met regularly at their florist clubs to examine choice flowers and discuss the best means of rearing them to perfection. Of these \\"bloom worshippers\\", MacDonald writes: In his report on the parish, the minister also explained that a \\"large and excellent school\\" under the patronage of Neale Thomson of Camphill, served the inhabitants of Crossmyloof and district, although it stood just across the boundary within Eastwood parish. The parish boundary was formed here by the Waterland stream, and its course can be traced between the ruinous remains of two old walls behind the school building on the north side of Skirving Street, now used as shops. Mr Smith describes how a number of years before, when there was no teacher for two years, the inhabitants, mostly weavers, formed themselves into an educational society to be managed by twelve directors under the presidency of the minister, and some of the \\"more intelligent\\" of the villagers undertook the task of teachers: a room was hired for the purpose, and a school opened from 8 to 10 o'clock at night, in which the teachers, two by two, in monthly turn, gave gratuitous instruction to whatever children were committed to their charge. The duty of the directors was principally to visit the school, and to wait upon careless parents to urge upon them the propriety of securing to their children the advantages which it offered. In 1877 the Cathcart School Board built Crossmyloof Public School in Stevenson (now Deanston) Drive. This school building has since been converted into flats. The first church to be erected in Crossmyloof was Langside Road Church (later Langside Avenue). This was built in 1859 for a United Presbyterian congregation which had been formed two years previously. The site at the corner of Baker Street and Langside Avenue was gifted by Neale Thomson. A new church was built on the same site in 1896. The congregation united with that of Shawlands Old in 1963 and the Langside Avenue buildings became St Helen's Catholic Church. The Langside Halls stand nearby, on the edge of Queen's Park. This building was originally the Bank of Glasgow, designed by John Gibson, when it stood in Queen Street in the centre of the city. In 1902-03 the building was relocated to its present site and converted to serve as public halls.Object 16: Decorative glass, 1865 at Royal Bank of Scotland Heritage Hub Pollokshaws Road and Minard Road provided the shopping area for Crossmyloof, Shawlands and Langside ‚Äì mainly in small shop units until the construction of the area's first supermarket by the Co-operative during the 1960s. Facilities Crossmyloof railway station Crossmyloof is served by a railway station on the Glasgow South Western Line, offering regular services to Glasgow Central. For many years, the most visible evidence of the area's name was the signage for Crossmyloof Ice Rink adjacent to the railway line, but that was replaced by a supermarket during the 1980s, which remains open today run by Morrisons. It was the first indoor ice rink in Scotland.http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/lifestyle/memories/crossmyloof-what-s- in-a-name-.1378374336 As well as the Langside Halls, the ice rink, the churches and the pubs on Pollokshaws Road, the area's main social amenity was the Waverley Cinema from 1922 until the early 1970s when the decline in film- going led to its conversion first into a bingo hall and then to TUSK nightclub and the Waverley Tearooms.

The first castle on the site was thought to have been built by Gerald of Windsor around 1110‚Äì1115, and it changed hands several times over the following century between English and Welsh forces. In the hands of William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, the construction of the stone castle began after 1223. After passing through successive families, it was left to ruin and eventually abandoned by 1400. The castle backs onto a cliff face, with the remaining ruins dating from the 13th century. It was most heavily fortified where it faces inland, and includes a pair of drum towers, rather than a central keep, which remain standing. It passed into the hands of the National Trust in 1938, who open it to the public. Description The castle sits on a rocky promontory above the River Teifi, with one side directly onto a cliff face. An earth and timber castle is believed to have existed prior to the current building, but was destroyed by Welsh forces. The existing masonry dates from around 13th century. The walls facing the cliff top were the least heavily fortified, with the defences concentrated on those that faced inland. These comprised two lines of defence, with an outer bailey and two drum towers rather than a central keep as typically seen in other castles of this period. The gatehouse is located in the south east of the building, and only partly remains. A ditch around the outside of the castle was cut from the rock face,Hull (2006): p. 55 which is thought to have once been spanned by a pivoting bridge.Hull (2006): p. 62 Cilgerran Castle is the most northerly of all castles in Pembrokeshire. It is twinned with Cardigan Castle, located on the opposite bank of the river downstream.Oman (1926): p. 213 The castle is largely ruinous, though the two substantial towers remain. From the castle there are walks down to the River Teifi. The castle is a National Trust property, in the guardianship of Cadw: Welsh Historic Monuments Executive Agency. It is open to the public under their auspices, and in 2015 it was the site of a re-enactment of the Battle of Agincourt to mark the 600th anniversary. History 'Kilgarran Castle', 1795 The initial Cilgerran Castle was built by Gerald of Windsor around 1110‚Äì1115, but was little more than a wooden palisade. This was replaced by a stone outer wall at some point prior to the attack by Rhys ap Gruffydd in 1165. Rhys had taken Cardigan Castle a matter of weeks before, and upon the capture of Cilgerran Castle, he destroyed it entirely. He began a reconstruction effort, using stone and lime mortar. In 1204, it was taken back for the English by William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who drove out Rhy's son, Maelgwn ap Rhys. Marshal set about making repairs, but these proved ineffective as it was taken once more in 1215 Llywelyn the Great after a single day's battle. It was recaptured by William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, in 1223. He began the rebuilding of the castle into its present form, which was later completed by the de Cantilupe family. The size of the stones used in the parts of the castle remaining from this period indicate that it was built at great haste. Cilgerran was not taken by Welsh forces after this period, although in 1258 when English forces were defeated nearby, the castle had to push back the forces of the Princes of Deheubarth.Oman (1926): p. 214 Following the death of Anselm Marshal, 6th Earl of Pembroke, it passed via a co-heiress to the de Cantilupe family. It passed again in 1272 after end of that line, to the Hastings family. But Cilgerran Castle was allowed to go to ruin by 1387, and was thought to be deserted by 1400. But the property continued to be passed down through the Earls of Pembroke into the time of Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford. In 1509, Gruffudd Vychan was named Steward of the Lordship of Cilgerran and Constable of Cilgerran Castle. It has been the subject of several paintings, including Kilgarran Castle on the Twyvey; Hazy Sunrise, previous to a Sultry Day, Cilgerran Castle on the Teifi, Looking Upstream, and View in Wales: Mountain Scene with Village and Castle ‚Äì Evening each by J. M. W. Turner which are all in the national collection at the Tate. In 1938, it was presented to the National Trust.

Early life Troy Perry is the eldest of five brothers born to \\"the biggest bootleggers in Northern Florida\\",Tobin, p. 14. Troy Perry and Edith Allen. As early as he can remember, Perry felt called to preach, labeling himself as a \\"religious fanatic\\". He was influenced by his aunts, who held street services in his hometown and who hosted Perry giving sermons from their home. Perry's father died fleeing the police when his son was eleven years old, cementing Troy's resolve to become involved in the church as much as possible. After his mother remarried and moved the family to Daytona Beach, Perry was abused by his stepfather and ran away from home, not returning until after she divorced him.\\"Troy Deroy Perry.\\" Religious Leaders of America, 2nd ed.

After Perry expressed his attraction towards males, his pastor suggested he marry a woman to resolve these feelings. He married this preacher's daughter, Pearl Pinion, in 1959, later remembering, \\"I was always interested in pastor's daughters because I thought they would make good preacher's wives. I didn't love her when I married her, but I did love her after our first year.\\"Tobin, p. 16 They had two sons and relocated to Illinois where Perry attended Midwest Bible College and Moody Bible Institute. Perry was the preacher at a small Church of God and sometimes had sexual relationships with other men but considered it just youthful exploration. When he was 19 years old, however, church administrators told him one of the men he had been with had told them what they had done. He was forced to leave the church immediately.Bullough, p. 394. They moved to Southern California, where he pastored a Church of God of Prophecy. After Perry's wife found his copy of The Homosexual in America by Donald Webster Cory hidden under the mattress, their marriage quickly dissolved. They divorced after five years of marriage. Perry was directed to pray about being led astray by his homosexual feelings and later was told by his bishop to renounce himself in the pulpit and resign. Perry worked in a Sears department store and was drafted for the army in 1965, during which time he served two years in Germany.Tobin, p. 16-17. Founding the Metropolitan Community Church In 1968, after a suicide attempt following a failed love affair, and witnessing a close friend being arrested by the police at The Patch Bar, a Los Angeles gay bar, Perry felt called to return to his faith and to offer a place for gay people to worship God freely. Perry put an advertisement in The Advocate announcing a worship service designed for gays in Los Angeles. Twelve people turned up on October 6, 1968 for the first service, and \\"Nine were my friends who came to console me and to laugh, and three came as a result of the ad.\\"Tobin, p. 19-20 After six weeks of services in his living room, the congregation shifted to a women's club, an auditorium, a church, and finally to a theater that could hold 600 within several months. In 1971, their own building was dedicated with over a thousand members in attendance. Being outspoken has caused several MCC buildings to be targeted for arson, including the original Mother Church in Los Angeles. Perry's theology has been described as conservative, but social action was a high priority from the beginning of the establishment of the denomination. Perry performed what Time Magazine described as the first public same-sex unions in the United States as early as 1968 and ordained women as pastors as early as 1972. MCC has more than 200 congregations (affiliated, emerging and oasis churches) in 33 countries. The 2007 documentary film titled Call Me Troy is the story of his life and legacy, including the founding of MCC and his struggles as a civil rights leader in the gay community. = Smithsonian Institution Archives = A collection of items from Perry and the Metropolitan Community Churches is held by the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. It was presented to the Smithsonian on the 51st anniversary of the founding of the church. The deed of gift was signed October 7, 2019, by Perry and his husband Phillip. It consists of personal items used by Rev. Troy Perry in the founding of the Metropolitan Community Churches, historical Items from members and friends concerning Metropolitan Community Churches as well as Items that detail the work of the church and Perry in their struggle for equal and civil rights.

Activism Perry preaching in 2006 at an MCC church in Minnesota. Perry's activism has taken many turns, including positions on a number of boards of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender organizations. He held a seat on the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations in 1973. Perry worked in political arenas to oppose Anita Bryant in the Save the Children campaign in 1977, that sought to overturn an anti-discrimination ordinance passed by the city of Miami. Unsuccessful in Miami, he also worked to oppose the Briggs Initiative in California that was written to ensure gay and lesbian teachers would be fired or prohibited from working in California public schools. Beginning on September 4, 1977, Perry held a 16-day fast on the steps of the Federal Building in Los Angeles to raise funds to fight the initiative. The Briggs Initiative was soundly defeated in 1978, due in large part to grass- roots organizing, which Perry participated in.Bullough, p. 396 Perry also planned the National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights in 1979 with Robin Tyler. On June 28, 1970, Rev. Perry, with two friends, Morris Kight and Bob Humphries, founded Christopher Street West to hold an annual Pride Parade. It is the oldest gay pride parade in the world. Today there are Pride Parades held all over the world, which are the direct result of this action. Millions of people worldwide attend these events each year.

She is best known as the co-director and editor of the documentary, The Corporation (2003), which examines large corporations in the 21st century. The documentary received 26 awards, including a Sundance Film Festival award, a Genie for best documentary and a top ten film of the year by the Toronto International Film Festival - though disqualified from the Oscars as an Ontario broadcast preceded the LA theatrical release. Abbott co-wrote and edited Sea Blind, about the sea route opening along the melting Arctic Ocean and the price of shipping our stuff. It screened at the 2015 Paris climate talks and is making the rounds to the ports of Europe projected onto walls of shipping containers. Abbott is the co- writer, co-director and editor of Us and Them, about four homeless and addicted street people shot over the course of 10 years, and the executive producer and editor of I Am. She was commissioned to create the short film Brave New Minds for the interactive website Unspeak by Amsterdam's Submarine Channel. Abbott's first feature documentary, A Cow at My Table (1998), explores contemporary Western attitudes to livestock and meat production. Her early work includes the experimental short Skinned screened at NY's Museum of Modern Art. She has taught at the Emily Carr Institute of Art & Design in Vancouver and lives on a permaculture farm on a small island on Canada's West Coast.  Career  = Filmmaking = Abbott's first film was A Cow at My Table (1998). The film addresses the ongoing battle between animal advocates and the meat industry in hopes to educate the Western consumer. Five years in production took Abbott across Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand to meet with leading activists for the animal rights movement, as well as spokesmen from livestock industries. In 2000, Abbott collaborated with director Mark Achbar to create Two Brides and a Scalpel: Diary of a Lesbian Marriage (2000). The documentary is a low-budget video diary of the first legally married lesbian couple in Canada. The film received multiple festival invitations, and was later broadcast on Canadian television networks. Abbott continued her collaboration with Achbar in 2003 when they co-directed the critically acclaimed documentary film, The Corporation (2003), written by Joel Bakan. The project began when Achbar and Bakan met at a funeral and realized they were both interested in globalization and its impact on society. The fact that no one had yet made a documentary on this issue shocked them both, so they decided to create one themselves. The film critically explores modern day corporations and the rise of dominant upper class institutions through the evaluation of corporate behavior towards society and the world at large. Through incorporating interviews with 40 corporate insiders and real-life case studies, Abbott hopes that the film will ultimately inspire strategies for change. During the directing/editing process, Abbott went through over 800 pages of interview transcripts. These transcripts were digitized and narrowed down until she felt the material had narrative flow and would resonate emotionally with the audience. It was important to her that the documentary did not force ideas onto the audience, but rather to ask more questions and keep it open to interpretation. During the filming of the documentary, Bakan wrote the book The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power.Libcom. Retrieved 2012-05-04. Abbott became involved with the documentary 'I Am (2011) after director Tom Shadyac saw The Corporation and invited Abbott to work as the editor on the film. The documentary explores Shadyac's personal journey after a 2007 bicycle accident caused him to suffer from post-concussion syndrome.

The church has had varying fortunes over many centuries, and is now very active, having been supported recently by Holy Trinity Brompton Church. History The old parish church, traditionally known as the Church of Sea Captains, was built in 1656, and was principally financed by Thomas Neale. It is believed that 75 sea captains are buried at the Church. Matthew Mead was minister of the chapel from 1658 until 1662, when he was replaced after the Restoration for being too non-conformist. During the Great Plague of London it was one of five sites in the parish of Stepney used as plague pits. It was rebuilt in 1669 as the Parish Church of Shadwell, and in an Act of 1670 by Archbishop of Canterbury William Sancroft, St Paul's Shadwell became a separate parish from St Dunstan's, Stepney, where it had previously been a hamlet. The church was named after St Paul's Cathedral, and became the first parish created from St Dunstan's, Stepney since Whitechapel in 1338. John Wesley was a preacher at St Paul's. Captain James Cook worshipped there, as did Jacob Phillip, the father of Captain Arthur Phillip, the first Governor of New South Wales. Cook's eldest son was baptised at St Paul's Church in 1763. Also baptised there were William Henry Perkin, the chemist who discovered the first aniline dye, and Jane Randolph, mother of Thomas Jefferson. The 1669 church was built in brick, and measured by . The church was demolished in 1817 and the present building, a Waterloo church designed by John Walters, was erected in 1821. It is the only building built by John Walters that still survives. In the 1840s, half of the churchyard land was bought by the London Dock Company in a compulsory purchase order, in order to expand Shadwell Basin. In 1950, the building became a Grade II* listed building.  Present  In January 2005, a team from the congregation of Holy Trinity Brompton moved to Shadwell to minister with the existing members of St. Paul's in serving the local area. This follows a number of similar church plants from Holy Trinity Brompton to declining churches around London with the support of the Bishop of London. The Rev Ric Thorpe was licensed as the new Priest-in-Charge on 20 January 2005 with The Rev Jez Barnes assisting him as the associate pastor. Thorpe was appointed Rector in 2010, and left in 2015 to become the Bishop of Islington. St Paul's stands in the charismatic and evangelical Anglican traditions.

It covers the conflict between animal rights advocates and the meat industry, and their respective attempts to influence consumers. It was directed, shot, and edited by Jennifer Abbott, who spent five years travelling across Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand to interview representatives on all sides. The film intercuts these interviews with images of farm animals and industrial farming operations. It explores what is sometimes popularly called factory farming. The filming of A Cow at My Table drew early criticism from the Canadian meat industry, with both the Ontario Chicken Marketing Board and the Dairy Farmers of Ontario publishing articles warning of Abbott's actions.

It is a biography of the title character, Erik. Plot summary The Phantom is born as Erik in Boscherville, a small town not far from Rouen, in the summer of 1831. His mother is the beautiful and talented daughter of an English woman and a French architect, a spoiled and vain woman who scorns her deformed child from birth, puts a mask on his face, and cannot bring herself to name him. Instead, she instructs the elderly priest who baptises him to name the child after himself. Due to his mother's shame but also for his own safety, Erik is forced to spend his childhood locked in his home lest he or his mother become a target for the violent attention of the superstitious villagers of Boscherville. Much of the verbal and physical abuse Erik suffers from his mother is chronicled in the opening chapters of the novel. After being forced to look at himself in a mirror Erik becomes fascinated, believing that mirrors are capable of performing magic. This fascination turns into an obsession and Erik quickly becomes a master of illusion, able to make people see only what he wants them to see. From a young age, Erik exhibits a strong interest in architecture and is privately tutored by a well-respected professor. However, his strongest abilities lie in the subject of music and he is an incredibly talented composer and performer. However, his mother does not encourage his pursuit of singing, claiming that his supernaturally beautiful voice cannot have been created by God. At nine years old Erik's mother begins to respond to the attentions of the handsome, new town physician, which upsets Erik. He uses his new-found abilities to hypnotize her into rejecting the physician's advances and keep her trapped in their home under his care, but his relationship with the villagers comes to a boiling point when they kill his beloved dog. Erik runs away from home believing this will make his mother's life easier. After a week or so without food, he stumbles upon a Gypsy camp in the woods. He is discovered as a thief and is unmasked. Upon seeing his face, a freak show showman named Javert decides to exhibit him as the \\"Living Corpse\\" and Erik is locked in a cage. The act involves a great deal of abuse including keeping his arms and legs tied down so that attendees can look at him, and the showman regularly beats him. Eventually, he gains some personal freedoms as he develops his show to include the illusions that he had begun to master as a child in Boscherville. He travels around Europe with the Gypsies and masters their languages as well as their herbal remedies, remaining with the tribe until he is about 12 years old when the showman drunkenly attempts to force himself on him, at which point Erik kills him and is forced to once again flee. While performing at a fair in Rome Erik meets Giovanni, a master mason who takes the boy on as his apprentice. Quickly mastering the design and construction of buildings, he stays with Giovanni until age 15. He spends a few happy years under the man's tutelage until Giovanni's spoiled teenage daughter, Luciana, returns from school. Her return causes a rift as she claims to be in love with Erik but seems incapable of communicating this in a healthy way, talking down to him and going as far as to smash his belongings after he does not pay desired attention to her. Erik is finally forced to again flee after causing Luciana's death inadvertently, as the crumbling stone of their terrace causes her to fall as she flees from the sight of his face. Erik continues to travel throughout Europe and into Asia, occasionally performing with travelling fairs. Four years later, he is sought out by the Daroga of Mazanderan Court, named Nadir in this interpretation, and becomes a court assassin, magician, and personal engineer to the Persian Shah. Responsible for the entertainment of the Khanum, the Shah's mother, he builds sophisticated traps and torture devices for her amusement. He builds an unlikely friendship with Nadir during this time. In addition, he is involved in the design and construction of a palace for the Shah, throughout that time becoming involved in political affairs which make him a target for a poisoning attempt from which he nearly dies but is saved by Nadir. He eventually flees once his status as a political target becomes obvious and makes his way back to France. Since early childhood, Erik has wanted to design a Paris Opera House. Unfortunately for him, the contest for the position is over by the time he learns of it. He approaches the winner, Charles Garnier, and makes a deal with him wherein he may help design and build the Palais Garnier Opera House. An underground lake is created, and without the knowledge of the other workers, Erik builds a maze of tunnels and corridors in the lower levels, and a lair for himself where he may live protected from the public. Besides being a brilliant inventor and engineer, Erik is also a musical genius, and he is frequently involved in the affairs of the opera house. Because he cannot show his face in public, he takes the disguise of a ghost, using violence in order to blackmail the opera managers and bind them to his will, exploiting the employees' superstitions to maintain his power. The rest of the book loosely follows the original novel The Phantom of the Opera - differing on several points but following the relationship between Erik and the object of his desire, Christine Daa√©, and switching back and forth between their points of view. The relationship between Christine and Erik is explored in greater detail and with greater compassion than the original novel, allowing Erik to finally find love and redemption in a world that has shown him nothing but cruelty since birth. Characters *Erik, the main character, is not listed as having a last name. Erik was born in 1831 in Boscherville, France, and lived until 1881, where he died in the catacombs beneath the Opera Garnier, where he had lived in what is referred to as \\"The House on the Lake,\\" the lake being, in this case, Lake Averne. Erik is said to have been unspeakably ugly, with sunken mismatched eyes that were not unlike a cat's, incredibly gaunt features, and no nose. Kay keeps to Leroux's original description, depicting Erik as having \\"sunken, mismatched eyes and grossly malformed lips, a horrible gaping hole where the nose should have been.\\" Erik is also skeletally thin, tall, and with abnormally long fingers which are possessed of an inhuman dexterity. He wears a full-mask at nearly all times, along with expensively tailored clothes and gloves, to hide his frightening appearance. He is also cold to the touch. He seems to have little or no sexual experience or outlet; most women are frightened or disgusted by his appearance, sometimes with fatal results (see description of Luciana below), and he was nearly raped as a young boy. Kay's Erik suffers from violent mood swings and depression, and over the course of the book, through various tragedies and a morphine addiction, he slowly loses whatever sanity he possessed. *Madeleine is Erik's mother. A rather spoiled and infantile woman, Madeleine is forced to birth and raise her son alone, when her husband, Charles, died unexpectedly at his work, shortly after Erik's conception. She is never overly kind to Erik, whom she resents and fears. She forces her son to sleep in the attic alone for his entire time in her house, making him wear a mask at all times, and forbidding him to leave the house under any circumstances. She beats him often, and rarely shows him any sort of affection. She is occasionally urged to do so by her plain and down-to-earth childhood friend, Marie Perrault. Later, after Erik survives a knife attack from the residents of her village, Madeleine finally realizes that she loves her son. Sadly, Erik has already run away without her noticing. *Javert is a man who traveled with a gypsy band. He was Erik's master, keeping the boy captive in a cage for a number of years. He was a cruel whipmaster. He becomes Erik's first murder victim when he attempts to rape him one night. *Giovanni is an elderly Italian master stonemason, who discovers a thirteen-year-old Erik on one of his sites one morning, and takes him on as an apprentice. Giovanni practically adopts Erik and loves him as the son he never had, while training him all the while as a mason. Erik flourishes underneath Giovanni's care, and though a darkness was growing in the boy, the Italian helped to quell it for some time. Their rapport was interrupted by the return of Giovanni's youngest daughter, Luciana. Giovanni was the only father that Erik had ever known, and he almost hero-worshiped the man. For the rest of his life, Erik would refer to no other man as \\"sir\\", due to the trust that was eventually lost between them. *Luciana is Giovanni's youngest daughter, out of four. At thirteen years old, she is a very spoiled child. She returns early from her convent school to find that her father has taken Erik on as an apprentice. Entranced by the young Erik's air of mystery, Luciana takes an instant liking to him, but seems unable to express her feelings for him, so she teases and torments him. Erik is attracted to her as well as she is particularly beautiful for her age. Eventually, she requests that Giovanni remove Erik's mask, and after she has seen his ugliness, she runs away, falling from a section of crumbling roof of their two story house and dying a grotesquely violent end. *Nadir Khan. Nadir Khan, known in Leroux's book only as \\"The Persian\\", is Erik's friend. As the Daroga of Mazanderan, he is sent by the Shah to fetch Erik from Nijni-Novgorod. Nadir is a moral character who lost his wife, Rookheeya, and has not remarried since. He is unlike most other Persian shahzadeh, being rather monogamous by nature, and despising the politics of the Mazanderan Court. Nadir and Erik take turns saving one another's lives, and in the process, become friends much closer than either is willing to admit. Nadir is ordered by the shah to keep a close eye on Erik, and takes it upon himself to be the keeper of Erik's conscience. Nadir is also an English word meaning \\"the lowest point\\", or \\"the moment of deepest depression\\". *Reza is Nadir's young son, who is dying from Tay‚ÄìSachs disease. Reza becomes attached to Erik; Erik in turn becomes fond of the boy, makes beautiful toys for him and tries to ease his suffering. When the boy's suffering worsens to pain and no hope of a recovery, Erik gives him a painless poison that puts Reza to his death because Nadir cannot bear to do it. This complicates the relationship between Erik and the Persian. *The Persian Shah is the ruler of Persia (by the book's chronology probably Naser al-Din Shah Qajar). He is depicted as being rather self-centered and helpless. He is largely a puppet of his mother, the khanum. He is a dangerous and powerful man, nonetheless, and Nadir worries very much for his and Erik's safety under the unstable favour of the shah. *The khanum, referred to as the Sultana or \\"the little sultana\\", in Leroux's book, is widely regarded as the most powerful woman in Persia. The khanum is a frightful woman. Drunk with the power that she has over her son, and therefore over Persia, she indulges in fetishes of every kind, normally involving some modicum of pain or humiliation. She is described as a woman of \\"intense and urgent passions\\", who finds a pleasure in death so powerful that it borders on sexual. Intrigued by Erik's macabre appearance and dexterity at murder, the khanum develops a great lust for him early on, and this she harbors spitefully, never quite daring to exercise her power in this particular area. Erik never learns of her infatuation with him, though it occurs to him in passing, but he puts it down to arrogance. (Historically the Mahd-i Ulya at this time was Malek Jahan Khanom.) *Christine Daa√© is the beautiful young Swedish chorus girl whom Erik meets at the Paris Opera. She is deceived into believing that Erik is the \\"Angel of Music\\", a story told to her by her late, and very beloved, father. She is described as having a voice that would make an angel cry, with perfect pitch and excellent vibrato, but absolutely no feeling whatsoever. Erik trains her to use her voice properly and, having done so, Christine sings wonderfully. Unfortunately, due to the machinations of the company's diva, La Carlotta, she is upstaged as soon as she steps out into the public's eye. She was born in 1861, the same year Madeleine died and the same year Simba was born, and is said to bear an almost perfect resemblance to her. *Charles is the son of Christine and Erik, born around 1881. Charles is born a few months after Raoul and Christine's wedding, and Raoul remarks that it is impossible that he is Charles' biological father, and that he looks nothing like either Raoul or Christine, but bears a striking resemblance to a portrait of Erik's handsome father Charles. Charles is an extremely handsome and talented young man, and a great musician. Seventeen years after Erik's death, Raoul brings him to visit the Opera House. *Raoul, Vicomte de Chagny recognizes Christine during one of her performances as a childhood sweetheart. They eventually marry and Christine gives up her opera career. Raoul raises their son, Charles, after her death from cancer. Charles is actually Erik's son, but is never told this in the story. *La Carlotta is the bratty diva of the Opera Garnier, and hails from Spain. *Madame Giry is Erik's loyal box-keeper. She waits on him, should he need it, and is one of the only characters in Paris to have any form of intimate contact with him. She is also the mother of Meg Giry. *Meg Giry is a somewhat sassy character, with a broad imagination, who enjoys tormenting Christine with made-up tales of the \\"Opera Ghost\\", leading to Erik musing she should take up writing Gothic novels. She is a ballet dancer and the daughter of Madame Giry. *Debienne and Poligny are the old managers of the Opera Garnier, and Poligny is described as being an easily spooked person, which made him an easy target for Erik's schemes. *Moncharmin and Richard are the new managers of the Opera House, though they know little about opera itself. They prove not to be quite so gullible as their predecessors, something which irks Erik to no end. It is an entirely mutual irritation, for Moncharmin and Richard are driven nearly mad by the arrogant, bossy, and magical \\"Opera Ghost\\". Moncharmin is quite small, Richard is quite large and strong *Sasha was Erik's boyhood pet dog, a golden spaniel who was murdered by a mob in trying to get Erik, the night before he ran away. *Ayesha was a Siamese cat Erik adopted on the streets of Paris during the 1871 Commune, when meat was scarce and cats and horses routinely butchered. During her time as a prisoner of Erik's house, at one point Christine feels jealous of Ayesha and the way Erik caresses her fondly while avoiding physical contact with Christine. Allusions/references to other works Kay's Phantom is not a sequel, but rather a retelling of the original Leroux novel. While the book draws mainly from Leroux's text, there are also obvious references to Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical: several phrases from the musical's lyrics are used to describe certain circumstances in the book. There are also nods to the Lon Chaney film version of the story. The character of Javert shares his name with the obsessive police captain who hunts Jean Valjean for twenty years in Victor Hugo's novel Les Mis√©rables. The storyline surrounding Erik's vain, childish mother bears some glancing similarities to Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary; like Emma Bovary, she lives in a stultifyingly provincial town and is courted by a medical man. In total, it took Kay eighteen months to complete the novel, during which time she traveled to the United States and Rome and researched various aspects of nineteenth-century life in the countries in which the novel was set. Among her references were Munro Butler Johnson's A Trip up the Volga to the Fair of Nijni-Novgorod; Curzon's Persia and the Persian Question; Lady Shell's \\"Eyewitness account of Persian court life in the mid-nineteenth century\\" and Christopher Mead's thesis on Charles Garnier. However, despite the many sources that Kay drew on, her story is original, and the ending is significantly different from those of other stories. The most obvious difference is that the famous grasshopper and scorpion scene, which forms the climax of Leroux's novel, has been completely removed. In addition, Kay's novel expands on themes, such as the Erik's time in Persia, that are only alluded to in the original story. Release details For several years, Phantom was out of print, and was only available on the secondary market. After the film version of Phantom Of The Opera was released in 2004, interest in the fandom‚Äîand prices for the book‚Äîrose dramatically. The novel was reprinted in October 2005 by Llumina Press. In Sweden the novel was only printed once, which makes it rather rare. In the Swedish translation, by Lena Torndahl, the whole sequence involving Christine finding a gigantic spider on her pillow and begs Erik to kill it (Whom during the whole novel compared himself with a spider) has been cut.

The company is a subsidiary of Clorox that describes itself as an \\"Earth friendly, Natural Personal Care Company\\" making products for personal care, health, beauty, and personal hygiene. Its products are distributed globally. Burt's Bees manufactures products with natural ingredients, using minimal processing, such as distillation/condensation, extraction/steamed distillation/pressure cooking, and hydrolysis, to maintain the purity of ingredients. In addition, every product has a \\"natural bar\\" which gives a percentage of natural ingredients in that product, often with detailed ingredient descriptions. History =1984‚Äì89: Founding= Burt's Bees Hand Salve, Sep 2012 Originating in Maine in the 1980s, the business began when co-founder Roxanne Quimby started making candles from Burt Shavitz's leftover beeswax. The first headquarters was an abandoned one-room schoolhouse rented from a friend for $150 a year. This eventually led to the bottling and selling of honey by the two co-founders, and Quimby's focus on maintaining high quality helped to grow the business from an initial $200 at the Dover-Foxcroft Junior High School craft fair to $20,000 in sales by the end of its first year. The practice of bottling honey slowly diminished as the company evolved as a corporation. \\"Eventually, other products using honey and beeswax, including edible spreads and furniture polish, were sold, before a move into the personal care line.\\" In late 2007, Clorox purchased Burt's Bees for US$925 million.Farrell, Andrew (October 21, 2007). \\"Clorox To Buy Burt's Bees\\". Forbes. Burt's Bees increased production in 1989, after a New York boutique, Zona, ordered hundreds of their beeswax candles. Forty additional employees were hired and an abandoned bowling alley became their new manufacturing location. During this time, Quimby read one of Burt Shavitz's 19th-century books about bee-keeping, which included home-made personal care recipes, prompting Burt's Bees to enter into the personal care products industry. =1990s: Incorporation and diversification= Burt's Bees became incorporated in 1991, and had a product line that included candles, natural soaps, perfumes, and, eventually, lip balm, which became their best-selling product. In 1993, Quimby threatened to sue Shavitz over personal issues, which, essentially, forced Shavitz out of the company's operations. Burt's Bees changed its focus to exclusively personal care products. In 1995, the company moved its manufacturing operations into a former garment factory in Creedmoor, North Carolina. Although Burt's Bees continued to focus on the \\"homemade\\" product theme, automated machines, such as a former cafeteria mixer from Duke University, were introduced to increase production. Chapel Hill was the site of the first Burt's Bees retail store, which offered 50 natural personal care products, and distribution had also reached the Japanese market. In 1998, Burt's Bees was offering over 100 natural personal care products in 4,000 locations with sales in excess of $8 million. Distribution had reached national retailers, such as Whole Foods Market, and restaurant chains, such as Cracker Barrel. New product offerings branched into travel-sized skin care and hair care products. In 1999, with increasing demand and an increase in product offerings, including sugar and milk-based body lotions and bath products; Burt's Bees relocated to Durham among the many other enterprises located in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina. An eCommerce website was launched, increasing distribution to a much larger, nationwide scale. In 1999, Quimby bought out Shavitz's one-third stake in the company, in exchange for a house in Maine, valued at approximately $130,000. =2000-06: New products and AEA= Burt's Bees Products, Sep 2012 During 2002 and 2003, Burt's Bees launched its first toothpaste, first shampoo, and its successful Baby Bee product line of infant personal care products. Co-founder Quimby also used company-earned profits to preserve of forest land in Maine, marking the beginning of a relationship with The Nature Conservancy, an international organization engaged in environmental protection and conservation. In 2004, private equity firm AEA Investors purchased 80% of Burt's Bees for US$173,000,000, with co-founder Quimby retaining a 20% share, and a seat on the company board. Upon seeking compensation from Quimby, after the deal, Shavitz was paid $4 million. =2007‚Äìpresent: Clorox acquisition= As of 2007, the company manufactured over 197 products, which are distributed globally. In late 2007, Clorox acquired Burt's Bees for a reported sum of $925 million USD. The company subsequently released a statement to its customers.\\"A Letter to Our Loyal Customers\\" at the Burt's Bees official website, archived 17 December 2007. In February 2011, Burt's Bees CEO (2006‚Äì2011) John Replogle left to become CEO and president of Seventh Generation Inc. In 2011, Nick Vlahos, a 15-year veteran of The Clorox Company, was named vice president and general manager of Burt's Bees, effective April 2011. In 2017, Nick Vlahos left Clorox and was named CEO of the Honest Company. By February 2014, the Clorox Company had increased \\"advertising and sales promotion spending for Burt's Bees, particularly for its lip care lines.\\" At the time, \\"Burt's Bees sales [were] outpacing volume due to price increases.\\" Co-founder Shavitz died in July 2015 at the age of 80, and was buried in Bangor, Maine. In his final years, he had lived on s in Parkman, Maine. In 2017, Burt's Bees introduced a full cosmetics line, including products such as foundation, mascara, eye shadow, and blush. As of March 2018, Burt's Bees lip balm had reached such a level of popularity that some reports claimed one tube of the lip balm was purchased every second. = Documentary film = In August 2014, a documentary film, Burt's Buzz, by Jody Shapiro, which details the history between the company co-founders, was released.

(a joint-stock company) is a multinational car tire producer based in P√∫chov, Slovakia, as well as the corresponding group of companies. It exports above 87% of its production into 80 countries worldwide. It does not produce only tires, but also associated and similar products and services. It has several trading companies and a network of shops. The largest export customers are the United States, UK, Germany, and the CIS states. Matador now also produces conveyor belts, automotive parts and machinery. History Automobil tire Matador Stella 2 175/65 R 14 (2017) The company arose in the town of P√∫chov in 1947 as a \\"national enterprise\\" that was split off from the old firm Matador Bratislava. Matador Bratislava was founded in 1905 (till 1911 known as the \\"Matador - Gummi und Balata Werke\\") involved mainly in the production of rubber hoses and belts in its new facilities in Petr≈æalka, a district of Bratislava. Since 1925, it has produced tires (the first tires producer in former Czechoslovakia). Its tires were fitted to many Czechoslovak automobiles of the 1930s, thus contributing in co-operation with the brands ≈†koda, Tatra, Aero and others to the development of automotive industry in Central Europe. The firm was nationalized in 1946 and privatized in 1995. Its trade name has been Matadorex, a.s. since the privatization. Matador in P√∫chov itself was established as a \\"national enterprise\\" (since 1988 \\"state-owned enterprise\\") for tire production in 1947. Production started in 1950. It was called \\"Gum√°rne 1. m√°ja\\" (which translates to \\"rubber works of 1st of may\\"), at that time and sold its products under the trademark Barum. Gradually it expanded its production and became the monopoly producer of air tubes (since 1962) and the main producer of rubber conveyor belts (since 1955) in Czechoslovakia. It also started to produce truck radial tires in the 1970s. The company founded its own R&D; center in 1987 (now \\"Vipo\\") and provided technical assistance for the construction of rubber works in India, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Burma, Syria, Turkey, Iran and Yugoslavia. In 1991 it was turned into a joint-stock company and privatization took place 1992-1994. The trademark of the products of the company was changed to Matador and the firm's name was changed to Gum√°rne Barum in 1991 and to Matador in 1993. The joint venture \\"Continental Matador\\" for the production of truck tires was established in P√∫chov in September 1998. In 1999 the transformation of the company took its final phase by change of management and by shift to division management system. The management of the Company is being transformed to the German model. * In 2001, Matador was one of the first companies in middle Europe to fulfil technical specification ISO/TS 16949. This is a system of quality management in the automotive industry accepted by important automotive associations. * In December, 2001 the company Det Norske Veritas issued the Management Quality System Certificate in accordance with standards ISO 9001:2000, valid for design, production, assembling, servicing and sales of machines and equipment for rubber industry and management of design and development, production, servicing and sales of moulds. * In September 2005 Matador celebrated its one hundredth anniversary and introduced a new company logo to represent the company. * In 2007 the company Continental AG acquired 51% of the Matador Rubber Division. * On July 1, 2008 Continental and Matador Group agreed on the transfer of an additional 15% of the shares in Continental Matador Rubber, at which date the Continental Group owned 66% of the shares in Continental Matador Rubber. * In 2009 Continental AG Hannover increased their capital share to 100%. New Continental‚Äôs distribution-logistic centre was open in that year in Puchov, for Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the new production finalisation hall. * In May 2010 Continental opened a new production hall in P√∫chov that enabled an increase of capacities for the production of passenger and light truck tires.

Like the traditional method of latitude and longitude, it is a horizontal position representation, which means it ignores altitude and treats the earth as a perfect ellipsoid. However, it differs from global latitude/longitude in that it divides earth into 60 zones and projects each to the plane as a basis for its coordinates. Specifying a location means specifying the zone and the x, y coordinate in that plane. The projection from spheroid to a UTM zone is some parameterization of the transverse Mercator projection. The parameters vary by nation or region or mapping system. Most zones in UTM span 6 degrees of longitude, and each has a designated central meridian. The scale factor at the central meridian is specified to be 0.9996 of true scale for most UTM systems in use. UTM zones on an equirectangular world map with irregular zones in red and New York City's zone highlighted History The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website states that the system was developed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, starting in the early 1940s. However, a series of aerial photos found in the Bundesarchiv-Milit√§rarchiv (the military section of the German Federal Archives) apparently dating from 1943‚Äì1944 bear the inscription UTMREF followed by grid letters and digits, and projected according to the transverse Mercator,BUCHROITHNER, Manfred F.; PFAHLBUSCH, Ren√©. Geodetic grids in authoritative maps‚Äìnew findings about the origin of the UTM Grid. Cartography and Geographic Information Science, 2016 a finding that would indicate that something called the UTM Reference system was developed in the 1942‚Äì43 time frame by the Wehrmacht. It was probably carried out by the Abteilung f√ºr Luftbildwesen (Department for Aerial Photography). From 1947 onward the US Army employed a very similar system, but with the now- standard 0.9996 scale factor at the central meridian as opposed to the German 1.0. For areas within the contiguous United States the Clarke Ellipsoid of 1866Equatorial radius 6,378,206.4 meters, polar radius 6,356,583.8 meters was used. For the remaining areas of Earth, including Hawaii, the International EllipsoidEquatorial radius 6,378,388 meters, reciprocal of the flattening 297 exactly was used. The World Geodetic System WGS84 ellipsoid is now generally used to model the Earth in the UTM coordinate system, which means current UTM northing at a given point can differ up to 200 meters from the old. For different geographic regions, other datum systems can be used. Prior to the development of the Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system, several European nations demonstrated the utility of grid-based conformal maps by mapping their territory during the interwar period. Calculating the distance between two points on these maps could be performed more easily in the field (using the Pythagorean theorem) than was possible using the trigonometric formulas required under the graticule-based system of latitude and longitude. In the post-war years, these concepts were extended into the Universal Transverse Mercator/Universal Polar Stereographic (UTM/UPS) coordinate system, which is a global (or universal) system of grid-based maps. The transverse Mercator projection is a variant of the Mercator projection, which was originally developed by the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator, in 1570. This projection is conformal, which means it preserves angles and therefore shapes across small regions. However, it distorts distance and area. Definitions =UTM zone= contiguous US UTM zones, projected with Lambert conformal conic. The UTM system divides the Earth into 60 zones, each 6¬∞ of longitude in width. Zone 1 covers longitude 180¬∞ to 174¬∞ W; zone numbering increases eastward to zone 60, which covers longitude 174¬∞E to 180¬∞. The polar regions south of 80¬∞S and north of 84¬∞N are excluded. Each of the 60 zones uses a transverse Mercator projection that can map a region of large north-south extent with low distortion. By using narrow zones of 6¬∞ of longitude (up to 668 km) in width, and reducing the scale factor along the central meridian to 0.9996 (a reduction of 1:2500), the amount of distortion is held below 1 part in 1,000 inside each zone. Distortion of scale increases to 1.0010 at the zone boundaries along the equator. In each zone the scale factor of the central meridian reduces the diameter of the transverse cylinder to produce a secant projection with two standard lines, or lines of true scale, about 180 km on each side of, and about parallel to, the central meridian (Arc cos 0.9996 = 1.62¬∞ at the Equator). The scale is less than 1 inside the standard lines and greater than 1 outside them, but the overall distortion is minimized. =Overlapping grids= Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Grid Zones 31N thru 37N differ from the standard 6¬∞ wide by 84¬∞ zone for the northern hemisphere, in part to accommodate the southern half of the Kingdom of Norway. For more on its history, see Clifford J. Mugnier's article on Grids & Datums of The Kingdom of Norway that appeared in the October 1999 issue of PE&RS; http://www.asprs.org/a/resources/grids/10-99-norway.pdf Distortion of scale increases in each UTM zone as the boundaries between the UTM zones are approached. However, it is often convenient or necessary to measure a series of locations on a single grid when some are located in two adjacent zones. Around the boundaries of large scale maps (1:100,000 or larger) coordinates for both adjoining UTM zones are usually printed within a minimum distance of 40 km on either side of a zone boundary. Ideally, the coordinates of each position should be measured on the grid for the zone in which they are located, but because the scale factor is still relatively small near zone boundaries, it is possible to overlap measurements into an adjoining zone for some distance when necessary. Latitude bands Latitude bands are not a part of UTM, but rather a part of the military grid reference system (MGRS). They are however sometimes used. =Latitude bands= Each zone is segmented into 20 latitude bands. Each latitude band is 8 degrees high, and is lettered starting from \\"C\\" at 80¬∞S, increasing up the English alphabet until \\"X\\", omitting the letters \\"I\\" and \\"O\\" (because of their similarity to the numerals one and zero). The last latitude band, \\"X\\", is extended an extra 4 degrees, so it ends at 84¬∞N latitude, thus covering the northernmost land on Earth. Latitude bands \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" do exist, as do bands \\"Y\\" and \\"Z\\". They cover the western and eastern sides of the Antarctic and Arctic regions respectively. A convenient mnemonic to remember is that the letter \\"N\\" is the first letter in \\"northern hemisphere\\", so any letter coming before \\"N\\" in the alphabet is in the southern hemisphere, and any letter \\"N\\" or after is in the northern hemisphere. =Notation= The combination of a zone and a latitude band defines a grid zone. The zone is always written first, followed by the latitude band. For example, (see image, top right), a position in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, would find itself in zone 17 and latitude band \\"T\\", thus the full grid zone reference is \\"17T\\". The grid zones serve to delineate irregular UTM zone boundaries. They also are an integral part of the military grid reference system. A note of caution: A method also is used that simply adds N or S following the zone number to indicate North or South hemisphere (the easting and northing coordinates along with the zone number supplying everything necessary to geolocate a position except which hemisphere). However, this method has caused some confusion since, for instance, \\"50S\\" can mean southern hemisphere but also grid zone \\"50S\\" in the northern hemisphere.See \\"The Letter after the UTM Zone Number: Is that a Hemisphere or a Latitudinal Band?\\", page 7, There are many possible ways to disambiguate between the two methods, two of which are demonstrated later in this article. =Exceptions= These grid zones are uniform over the globe, except in two areas. On the southwest coast of Norway, grid zone 32V (9¬∞ of longitude in width) is extended further west, and grid zone 31V (3¬∞ of longitude in width) is correspondingly shrunk to cover only open water. Also, in the region around Svalbard, the four grid zones 31X (9¬∞ of longitude in width), 33X (12¬∞ of longitude in width), 35X (12¬∞ of longitude in width), and 37X (9¬∞ of longitude in width) are extended to cover what would otherwise have been covered by the seven grid zones 31X to 37X. The three grid zones 32X, 34X and 36X are not used.

The point of origin of each UTM zone is the intersection of the equator and the zone's central meridian. To avoid dealing with negative numbers, the central meridian of each zone is defined to coincide with meters East. In any zone a point that has an easting of meters is about 100 km west of the central meridian. For most such points, the true distance would be slightly more than 100 km as measured on the surface of the Earth because of the distortion of the projection. UTM eastings range from about meters to meters at the equator. In the northern hemisphere positions are measured northward from zero at the equator. The maximum \\"northing\\" value is about meters at latitude 84 degrees North, the north end of the UTM zones. In the southern hemisphere northings decrease southward from the equator, set at meters, to about meters at 80 degrees South, the south end of the UTM zones. For the southern hemisphere, its northing at the equator is set at meters so no point has a negative northing value. The CN Tower is at , which is in UTM zone 17, and the grid position is m east, m north. Two points in Zone 17 have these coordinates, one in the northern hemisphere and one in the south; one of two conventions is used to say which: #Append a hemisphere designator to the zone number, \\"N\\" or \\"S\\", thus \\"17N 630084 4833438\\". This supplies the minimum information to define the position uniquely. #Supply the grid zone, i.e., the latitude band designator appended to the zone number, thus \\"17T 630084 4833438\\". The provision of the latitude band along with northing supplies redundant information (which may, as a consequence, be contradictory if misused). Because latitude band \\"S\\" is in the northern hemisphere, a designation such as \\"38S\\" is unclear. The \\"S\\" might refer to the latitude band (32¬∞N‚Äì40¬∞N) or it might mean \\"South\\". It is therefore important to specify which convention is being used, e.g., by spelling out the hemisphere, \\"North\\" or \\"South\\", or using different symbols, such as ‚àí for south and + for north. = Simplified formulae = These formulae are truncated version of Transverse Mercator: flattening series, which were originally derived by Johann Heinrich Louis Kr√ºger in 1912.Kr√ºger, L.

By convention, in the northern hemisphere N_{0}=0 km and in the southern hemisphere N_{0}=10000 km. By convention also k_{0}=0.9996 and E_{0}=500 km. In the following formulas, the distances are in kilometers.

Founded and led by entertainer Tom Jackson, the Huron Carole toured across Canada during the Christmas season of each year from 1987 to 2004. It collected more than $3.55 million, and numerous tonnes of food. After an eight-year hiatus, the Huron Carole began again in 2012 and 2013. The name of the fundraiser comes from the Huron Carol, Canada's oldest Christmas carol, written by Father Jean de Br√©beuf in the 17th century. The opening lines of the English version of the carol, \\" 'Twas in the moon of wintertime / When all the birds had fled\\" fits in with the tour's theme of the need to raise food for others, particularly in the cold of winter. First run Tom Jackson founded the Huron Carole in 1987. From 1987 to 2004, the Huron Carole regularly toured across Canada during the Christmas season. Led by Jackson, who also performed in the show, the Huron Carole enlisted the help of musical artists from across Canada to raise money and donations for foodbanks. The musical style tended to country and soft rock, with a strong Christmas theme. Second run The Huron Carole began again in 2012 and toured in 2013 as well. =2013 Tour= The 2013 tour began on November 23 in Halifax and ended on December 19 in Victoria, appearing in sixteen different cities in eight provinces. The performers were Tom Jackson, Shannon Gaye, Beverley Mahood, One More Girl, and George Canyon, supported by a touring band. The national sponsors for the tour were Great-West Life, London Life, Canada Life, Enbridge, Sentry, Nov, and CMT. There are also local sponsors in each city the tour covers. Related food-bank fundraisers After the 2004 tour, Jackson began two new fundraisers for food-banks, Singing for Supper and Swinging for Supper, both beginning in 2005. Singing for Supper featured Jackson travelling smaller cities from Thunder Bay to Halifax, and playing concerts in churches and community halls along the way. Swinging for Supper is an annual series of fundraising golf tournaments, also under Jackson's leadership. The Cause The Canadian food banks have a lot of community help with these events during the Christmas season. Unfortunately, the need in the summer months does not decrease, and the donations do. They have in recent years started to do local fundraising for \\"Christmas in July\\", but there really is not anything that is as far reaching as the Huron Carole.

They and Paramaecium are the best known Christian Doom metal bands, though they were always wary of being typecast as such. They recorded two demos, and two albums, and played many gigs in England, the Netherlands and Germany. Featuring clean and growled male vocals, and female vocals, their music was heavy, slow to mid-paced, and influenced by medieval music, doom, death and goth. The band split up in 2005, when Arkley went on to form My Silent Wake. Biography The first demo tape, Ashen Mortality, was recorded at The Wall, Birmingham, England, from 9‚Äì11 October 1993, and engineered by Andy Wickett. The band's first gig was with Rez Band, during November 1993 in Salford, England. During 1994, Ashen Mortality played many gigs around the United Kingdom, including a show at the Brixton Academy, London, on 14 May. The second demo was recorded between 16‚Äì18 July 1994 at Attic Studios, shortly after which, Jones left the band. On 24 August, Ashen Mortality played at the Greenbelt festival with stand-in drummer, Neal Harris. Harris also played with the band during the tour of Holland and Germany from 2‚Äì29 September. Three tracks from the second demo, \\"Separation\\", \\"Sleepless Remorse\\" and \\"Imprisoned\\", were remixed, and four new songs recorded in 1995 to form Sleepless Remorse, the band's first album. Harris played drums on the new tracks, although Jones can be heard on the remixed demo songs. The album was recorded at Attic Studios (now closed), and was produced for a mere ¬£400. Sleepless Remorse was released in 1996 on Forsaken Records, set up by Bolton. Neil Shilvock joined the band on drums. Ashen Mortality played many gigs in England during the year, playing with bands including: At the Gates, Serenade (band), Acrimony and Hecate Enthroned. After a mini-tour to support the release of Sleepless Remorse in 1997, Shilvock left the band, and George Aytoun stepped in to help out. Ashen Mortality played at the Greenbelt festival over the August bank holiday weekend. Aytoun officially joined the band in 1998, and recorded Your Caress. The recording process took place in April 1998. The album was recorded in two days, and mixed in one by Dan Sprigg at Dep International. The band used the same engineer and studio as Cradle of Filth. Shortly after this recording the band relocated to Weston-super-Mare. The band started to play local gigs again in 1999, and the official website was constructed by Aytoun, and launched over the summer. Ashen Mortality appeared at the Greenbelt festival at the beginning of August. The band obtained worldwide distribution for Your Caress through Plastic Head. With the exception of a few local gigs, there was little band activity in 2000. Plans to record a third album faded away. After several years of inactivity, the band re-emerged in 2004. Having recruited a new drummer and bassist, they began rehearsing again, and played 2 live gigs. Due to illness, Cooper was unavailable for the band's final appearances in Norway and the United Kingdom. The last performances featured Andi Lee on bass guitar and Jasen Whyte on drums. A double CD reissue of the two albums, remastered with extra tracks, was released in 2005. The band finally split up, with the original band members going their separate ways in April 2005. Ian subsequently formed My Silent Wake with ex-Ashen Mortality musicians Andi Lee and Jason Whyte, Century Sleeper with James Allin of Visionaire, and played in The Other Window with Alan Southorn. A few years later, Ian also reformed Seventh Angel. In August 2006, Tim Cooper died of leukemia.

The Asian Century is the projected 21st-century dominance of Asian politics and culture, assuming certain demographic and economic trends persist. The concept of Asian Century parallels the characterisation of the 19th century as Britain's Imperial Century, and the 20th century as the American Century and Pax Sovietica. A 2011 study by the Asian Development Bank found that an additional 3 billion Asians could enjoy living standards similar to those in Europe today, and the region could account for over half of global output by the middle of this century. It warned, however, that the Asian Century is not preordained. The growing importance and emphasis of unity in Asia, as well as maturing and progressive relationships among countries in the region further solidify the creation of the 21st Asian Century. Origin In 1924, Karl Haushofer used the term \\"Pacific age,\\" envisaging the growth of Japan, China and India: \\"A giant space is expanding before our eyes with forces pouring into it which ... await the dawn of the Pacific age, the successor of the Atlantic age, the over-age Mediterranean and European era.\\"Cited in Hans Weigert, \\"Haushofer and the Pacific,\\" Foreign Affairs, 20/4, (1942): p 735. The phrase Asian Century arose in the mid to late 1980s, and is attributed to a 1988 meeting with People's Republic of China (PRC) leader Deng Xiaoping and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in which Deng said that '[i]n recent years people have been saying that the next century will be the century of Asia and the Pacific, as if that were sure to be the case. I disagree with this view.' Prior to this, it made an appearance in a 1985 US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations hearing. It has been subsequently reaffirmed by Asian political leaders, and is now a popularly used term in the media. Reasons Asia's robust economic performance over the three decades preceding 2010, compared to that in the rest of the world, made perhaps the strongest case yet for the possibility of an Asian Century. Although this difference in economic performance had been recognised for some time, specific individual setbacks (e.g., the 1997 Asian financial crisis) tended to hide the broad sweep and general tendency. By the early 21st century, however, a strong case could be made that this stronger Asian performance was not just sustainable but held a force and magnitude that could significantly alter the distribution of power on the planet. Coming in its wake, global leadership in a range of significant areas‚Äîinternational diplomacy, military strength, technology, and soft power‚Äîmight also, as a consequence, be assumed by one or more of Asia's nation states. Among many scholars have provided factors that have contributed to the significant Asian development, Kishore Mahbubani provides seven pillars that rendered the Asian countries to excel and provided themselves with the possibility to become compatible with the Western counterparts. The seven pillars include: free- market economics, science and technology, meritocracy, pragmatism, culture of peace, rule of law and education. Professor John West in his book 'Asian Century ‚Ä¶ on a Knife-edge' argues: \\"Over the course of the twenty-first century, India could well emerge as Asia‚Äôs leading power. Already, India‚Äôs economy is growing faster than China‚Äôs, a trend which could continue, unless China gets serious about economic reform. Further, India‚Äôs population will overtake China‚Äôs in 2022 and could be some 50% higher by 2100, according to the UN\\". In 2019 professor Chris Ogden, a Lecturer in Asian Security at the University of St Andrews, wrote that, \\"Although still behind relatively in terms of income per capita and infrastructure, as this wealth is translated into military, political, and institutional influence (via bodies such as the United Nations and the new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank), Asia‚Äôs two largest powers will gain a structural centrality and importance that will make them critical global lynchpins. Expectant populations and vocal leaders are accelerating and underpinning this criticality, and‚Äîif the existential issues of environmental pollution and corruption can be overcome‚Äîherald the emergence of an Asian-centric, and China / India-centric, world order that will form of the essential basis of international affairs for many decades to come.\\" =Demographics= Population growth in Asia is expected to continue through at least the first half of the 21st century, though it has slowed significantly since the late 20th century. At four billion people in the beginning of the 21st century, the Asian population is predicted to grow to more than five billion by 2050. While its percent of the world population is not expected to greatly change, North American and European shares of the global population are expected to decline. =Economics= The global contribution to world's GDP by major economies from 1 AD to 2003 AD according to Angus Maddison's estimates.Data table in Maddison A (2007), Contours of the World Economy I-2030AD, Oxford University Press, Before 18th century, China and India were the two largest economies by GDP output. Projected GDP of 7 largest economies in 2050. Projected shares of global GDP by region to 2050 Nanjing Road in Shanghai is an example of economic growth in mainland China, and its large consumer base. India's middle-class population of 300 million is growing at an annual rate of 5%. Shown here is an upmarket area in South Mumbai. The major driver is continued productivity growth in Asia, particularly in China and India, as living standards rise. Even without completely converging with European or North American living standards, Asia's might produce half of global GDP by 2050. This is a large shift compared to the immediate post-cold war, when North America and Europe combined produced half of global GDP. A 2011 study by the Asian Development Bank stated that: \\"By nearly doubling its share of global gross domestic product (GDP) to 52 percent by 2050, Asia would regain the dominant economic position it held some 300 years ago. The notion of the Asian Century assumes that Asian economies can maintain their momentum for another 40 years, adapt to shifting global economic and technological environment, and continually recreate comparative advantages. In this scenario, according to 2011 modelling by the Asian Development Bank Asia's GDP would increase from $17 trillion in 2010 to $174 trillion in 2050, or half of global GDP. In the same study, the Asian Development Bank estimates that seven economies would lead Asia's powerhouse growth; under the Asian Century scenario, the region would have no poor countries, compared with eight in 2011. Since China's economic reforms in the late 1970s (in farm privatisation) and early 1990s (in most cities), the Chinese economy has enjoyed three decades of economic growth rates between 8 and 10%. The Indian economy began a similar albeit slower ascent at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s, and has averaged around 4% during this period, though growing slightly over 8% in 2005, and hitting 9.2% in 2006 before slowing to 6% in 2009, then reaching 8.9% in 2010. Both of these developments involved policy of a degree of managed liberalisation of the economy as well as a turning outwards of the economy towards globalisation (both exports and attracting inward investment). The magnitude of this liberalisation and globalisation is still subject to debate. They were part of conscious decisions by key political leaders, especially in India and the PRC. Also, the populations of the two countries offer a potential market of over two and a quarter billion. The development of the internal consumer market in these two countries has been a major basis for economic development. This has enabled much higher national growth rates for China and India in comparison to Japan, the EU and even the US. The international cost advantage on goods and services, based on cheaper labor costs, has enabled these two countries to exert a global competitive pressure. The term Easternization has been used to refer to the spread of oriental (mainly Japanese) management techniques to the West.Raffin, Anne, \\"Easternization Meets Westernization: Patriotic Youth Organizations in French Indochina during World War 2\\"Kaplinsky, Raphael, Easternization: The spread of Japanese Management Techniques to Developing CountriesKwang-Kuo Hwang, Easternization: Socio-cultural Impact on Productivity The trend for greater Asian economic dominance has also been based on the extrapolations of recent historic economic trends. Goldman Sachs, in its BRIC economic forecast, highlighted the trend towards mainland China becoming the largest and India the second largest economies by the year 2050 in terms of GDP. The report also predicted the type of industry that each nation would dominate, leading some to deem mainland China 'the industrial workshop of the world' and India 'one of the great service societies'.David, Jacques-Henri. \\"In 2020, America Will Still Dominate Global Economy\\", Le Figaro, 25 August 2005. Retrieved 21 September 2006. As of 2009, the majority of the countries that are considered newly industrialized are in Asia. By 2050, the East Asian and South Asian economies will have increased by over 20 times. With that comes a rise in Human Development Index, the index used to measure the standards of living. India's HDI will approach .8. East Asia's would approach .94 or fairly close to the living standards of the western nations such as the EU and the US. This would mean that it would be rather difficult to determine the difference in wealth of the two. Because of East Asian and Indian populations, their economy would be very large, and if current trends continue, India's long-term population could approach double that of China. East Asia could surpass all western nations' combined economies as early as 2030. South Asia could soon follow if the hundreds of millions in poverty continue to be lifted into middle class. Construction projects International Finance Centre in Hong Kong It is projected that the most groundbreaking construction projects will take place in Asia within the approaching years. As a symbol of economic power, supertall skyscrapers have been erected in Asia, and more projects are currently being conceived and begun in Asia than in any other region of the world. Completed projects include: the Petronas Towers of Kuala Lumpur, the Shanghai World Financial Center, International Finance Centre in Hong Kong, Taipei 101 in Taiwan, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, UAE, and the Shanghai Tower. Future buildings promise to be taller, such as the PNB 118 in Kuala Lumpur and Legacy Tower in Dhaka. =Culture= Culturally, the Asian century is symbolised by Indian genre films (Bollywood, Parallel Cinema), Hong Kong genre films (martial arts films, Hong Kong action cinema), Japanese animation, and the Korean Wave. The awareness of Asian cultures may be a part of a much more culturally aware world, as proposed in the Clash of Civilizations thesis. Equally, the affirmation of Asian cultures affects the identity politics of Asians in Asia and outside in the Asian diasporas. The Gross National Cool of Japan is soaring; Japanese cultural products, including TV shows, are undoubtedly \\"in\\" among American audiences and have been for years. About 2.3 million people studied the language worldwide in 2003: 900,000 South Koreans, 389,000 Chinese, 381,000 Australians, and 140,000 Americans study Japanese in lower and higher educational institutions. Feng shui books topped the nonfiction best-seller lists and feng shui schools have multiplied. Major banks and multinational corporations employ feng shui consultants to advise them on the organisation of their offices. There has been a readiness to supplement Eastern forms of medicine, therapy, and massage and reject traditional Western medicine in favor of techniques, such as acupressure and acupuncture. Practices such as moxibustion and shiatsu enjoy enormous popularity in the West.Colin Campbell, Easternization of the West\\" p. 19 So do virtually all the Eastern martial arts, such as kung fu, judo, karate, aikido, taekwondo, kendo, jujitsu, tai chi, qigong, ba gua, and xing yi, with their many associated schools and subforms.Colin Campbell, Easternization of the West\\" p. 20 Asian cuisine is quite popular in the West due to Asian immigration and subsequent interest from non-Asians into Asian ingredients and food. Even small towns in Britain, Canada, Scandinavia, or the United States generally have at least one Indian or Chinese restaurant.Colin Campbell, Easternization of the West\\" p. 21 Restaurants serving pan-Asian and Asian-inspired cuisine have also opened across North America, Australia and other parts of the world. P.F. Chang's China Bistro and Pei Wei Asian Diner which serve Asian and Asian-inspired food is found across the United States and in regards for the former, in other parts of the world as well. Asian-inspired food products have also been launched including from noodle brand, Maggi. In Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the UK an Asian-inspired range of noodles known as Maggi Fusian and a long running range in Germany and Austria known as, Maggi Magic Asia includes a range of noodles inspired by food dishes found in China, Japan, Korea, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand. Yoga has gained popularity outside India and the rest of Asia and has entered mainstream culture in the Western world. Though the use of English continues to spread, Asian languages are becoming more popular to teach and study outside the continent. The study of Chinese has recently gained greater attention in the United States, owing to a growing belief in the economic advantages of knowing it.Paulson, Amanda. \\"Next hot language to study: Chinese\\", The Christian Science Monitor, 8 November 2005. Retrieved 21 September 2006. It is being encouraged through the PRC's support of Confucius Institutes, which have opened in numerous nations to teach the Chinese language and culture. Chinese has been rated as the second most used language on the internet with nearly a quarter speaking Chinese, Japanese came as fourth, and Korean as the tenth as of 2010. According to the CIA, China hosted the most users, India the third, Japan the sixth, and Indonesia as the tenth as of 2020. India has the largest film industry in the world, and Indian Film Industry produces more films than Nollywood and Hollywood. In the early years of the twentieth century very few people were vegetarians. The figure given for the United Kingdom during World War 2 was 100,000 out of a population of some 50 million ‚Äì around 0.2 per cent of the total. By the 1990s the figure was estimated as between 4.2 percent and 11 percent of the British population and rising rapidly.Cohen, 1999. As Porritt and Winner observe, as recently as the 1960s and early '70s, \\"being a vegetarian was considered distinctively odd,\\" but \\"it is now both respectable and common place.\\"Colin Campbell, \\"Easternization of the West\\" p. 80 The spread of the Korean wave, particularly K-pop and Korean dramas, outside Asia has led to the establishment of services to sustain this demand. Viki and DramaFever are examples of services providing Korean dramas to international viewers alongside other Asian content. SBS PopAsia and Asian Pop Radio are two radio-related music services propagating the proliferation of K-pop throughout Australia. Apart from K-pop, Asian Pop Radio is also devoted to other Asian pop music originating from Indonesia, Thailand, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore. Similarly, SBS PopAsia focuses on other East Asian pop music from China and Japan and to some extent Southeast Asian pop music in conjunction with K-pop. The rising popularity of Asian-related content has resulted in \\"SBS PopAsia\\" becoming a brand name for SBS content such as TV shows and news originating from Asia such as China, South Korea, Japan and India. The growing awareness and popularity of Eastern culture and philosophies in the West has led to Eastern cultural objects being sold in these countries. The most well known being statues of the Buddha which range from statues sold for the garden to items sold for the house. Statues of Hindu gods such as Ganesha and East Asian iconography such as the Yin and yang are also sold in many stores in Western countries. Ishka a chain store in Australia sells many Asian-origin content particularly from India. The selling of Eastern cultural objects has however been met by criticism, with some saying many who buy these items do not understand the significance of them and that it is a form of Orientalism. Emojis which originated in Japan and later spread to other parts of Asia have now become mainstream in Western societies. Eastern emoticons particularly Japanese emoticons known as \\"kaomoji\\" have also become popular in the West in conjunction with Western-origin emoticons, resulting in a blend of the two. A 2006 study showed North American instant messaging users rated the importance of using emoticons much lower than Indian and East Asian users. However, by the 2010s, a 2013 questionnaire showed 74% of people in the US responded positively to the question, \\"Do you use stickers or emoji in messaging apps?‚Äù Characters used as emoticons that are used in certain Asian languages such as Kannada, an Indian language, has spread to and become popular to use on Western websites after initially being used on Japanese sites such as 2channel. Asian-origin characters that have become popular to use on Western websites include ‡≤† and ‡≤• (both of Kannada origin), ‡∏á (Thai origin), Áõä (Chinese origin), „ÖÖ (Korean origin) and „ÉÆ and „ÉÑ (both of Japanese origin), for example, which are all used with other symbols to create emoticons. =Religion= As recently as the 1950s, Crane Brinton, the distinguished historian of ideas, could dismiss \\"modern groups that appeal to Eastern wisdom\\" as being in effect \\"sectarian\\", \\"marginal\\", and \\"outside the main current of Western thought and feeling\\".Colin Campbell, Easternization of the West\\" p. 29 Yet some Westerners have converted to Eastern religions or at least have shown an interest in them. An example is Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, whom the Beatles followed, first to Bangor in Wales in 1967, and subsequently to India to study Transcendental Meditation in 1968. The Dalai Lama, whose book The Art of Happiness became a best-seller, can attract huge crowds in New York's Central Park or London's Wembley Stadium.Colin Campbell, Easternization of the West\\" p. 23 Buddhism in some countries is the second biggest religion. FWBO is one of the biggest and fastest-growing Buddhist organisations in the West.Colin Campbell, Easternization of the West\\" p. 25 Belief in reincarnation has never been a part of official Christian or Jewish teaching, or at least, in Christianity, it has been a formal heresy since it was rejected by a narrow margin at the Second Council of Constantinople in AD 553.Weatherhead, Leslie D., The Christian Agnostic However nearly all polling in Western countries reveals significant levels of this belief. \\"Puzzled People\\" undertaken in the 1940s suggested that only 4 per cent of people in Britain believed in reincarnation. Geoffrey Gorer's survey, carried out a few years later, arrived at 5 percent (1955, p. 262). However, this figure had reached 18 percent by 1967 (Gallup, 1993), only to increase further to a sizable 29 percent by 1979, a good six- fold increase on the earlier \\"Puzzled People\\" figure. Eileen Barker has reported that around one-fifth of Europeans now say that they believe in reincarnation.Colin Campbell, Easternization of the West\\" pp. 72‚Äì73 Karma, which has its roots in ancient India and is a key concept in Hinduism, Buddhism and other Eastern religions, has entered the cultural conscience of many in the Western world. John Lennon's 1970 single, \\"Instant Karma!\\" is credited towards the popularisation of karma in the Western world and is now a widely known and popular concept today giving rise to catchphrases and memes and figuring in other forms of Western popular culture. Mindfulness and Buddhist meditation, both very popular in Asia, have gained mainstream popularity in the West. =Politics= The cargo of a container ship from East Asia being unloaded at the Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Navi Mumbai, India. Increasing economic integration of Asian countries has also brought them closer politically. The global political position of China and to a lesser extent India has risen in international bodies and amongst the world powers, leading the United States and European Union to become more active in the process of engagement with these two countries. China is also a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Although India is not a permanent member, it is possible that it will become one or at the least gain a more influential position. Japan is also attempting to become a permanent member, though the attempts of both are opposed by other Asian countries (i.e. India's bid is opposed by Pakistan; Japan's bid is opposed by China, South Korea, North Korea). An Asian regional bloc may be further developed in the 21st century around ASEAN and other bodies on the basis of free trade agreements. However, there is some political concern amongst the national leaderships of different Asian countries about PRC's hegemonic ambitions in the region. Another new organization, the East Asian Summit, could also possibly create an EU-like trade zone. The Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov encouraged the idea of a triple alliance between Russia, the PRC and India first formulated by Indian strategist Madhav Das Nalapat in 1983, and supported the idea of a multipolar world. With the November 2006 visit of Hu Jintao to India, the idea seems to be gaining some momentum. =Human Capital= The 2007 World Bank Report on globalization notes that \\"rising education levels were also important, boosting Asian growth on average by 0.75 to 2 percentage points.\\" The rapid expansion of human capital through quality education throughout Asia has played a significant role in experiencing \\"higher life expectancy and economic growth, and even to the quality of institutions and whether societies will make the transition into modern democracies\\". =3G (Global Growth Generators)= The Asian countries with the most promising growth prospects are: Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Mongolia, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. Developing Asia is projected to be the fastest growing region until 2050, driven by population and income growth: 9 of 11 3G countries came from Asia. Vietnam has the highest Global Growth Generators Index, China is second with 0.81, followed by India's 0.71. Based on a report from the HSBC Trade Confidence Index (TCI) and HSBC Trade Forecast, there are 4 countries with significant trade volume growth ‚Äì Egypt, India, Vietnam and Indonesia ‚Äì with growth is projected to reach at least 7.3 per cent per year until 2025 =Next Eleven= The Next Eleven (known also by the numeronym N-11) are the eleven countries ‚Äì Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Turkey, South Korea, and Vietnam ‚Äì identified by Goldman Sachs investment bank and economist Jim O'Neill in a research paper as having a high potential of becoming, along with the BRICs/BRICS, the world's largest economies in the 21st century. The bank chose these states, all with promising outlooks for investment and future growth, on 12 December 2005. At the end of 2011, the four major countries (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey) also known as MINT, made up 73 percent of all Next Eleven GDP. BRIC GDP was $13.5 trillion, while MIKT GDP at almost 30 percent of that: $3.9 trillion. Challenges to realising the Asian Century Asia's growth is not guaranteed. Its leaders will have to manage multiple risks and challenges, particularly: * Growing inequality within countries, in which wealth and opportunities are confined to the upper echelons. This could undermine social cohesion and stability. * Many Asian countries like Pakistan will not be able to make the necessary investments in infrastructure, education and government policies that would help them avoid the Middle Income Trap. * Intense competition for finite natural resources, such as land, water, fuel or food, as newly affluent Asians aspire to higher standards of living. * Global warming and climate change, which could threaten agricultural production, coastal populations, and numerous major urban areas. * Rampant corruption, which plagues many Asian governments. * Aging population can have a direct influence on the continuous economic development of Asian countries in terms of such as, but not limited to, declining labour force, change of consumption patterns, strain on public finances and so on. Criticism Despite forecasts that predict the rising economic and political strength of Asia, the idea of an Asian Century has faced criticism. This has included the possibility that the continuing high rate of growth could lead to revolution, economic slumps, and environmental problems, especially in mainland China. Some believe that the 21st century will be multipolar, and no one country or continent will have such a concentration of influence. However, some proponents of the Asian Century respond that since the two most populous countries (China and India) are in Asia, then it is only natural that they will play a bigger role in the world's affairs than smaller countries and thus it won't be a multipolar century. Finally, although the British Empire was a superpower during the nineteenth century, controlling nearly a quarter of the world's area and population, during the 20th century there was still a balance of political power with the British and other European colonial empires from 1900 until 1945, and with the US and the Soviet Union from 1945 until 1991.

Politicians who were active in the Klan at some time  = Robert Byrd = Senator Robert Byrd was a Kleagle, a Klan recruiter, in the 1940s A Democrat, Robert C. Byrd, was a recruiter for the Klan while in his 20s, rising to the title of Kleagle and Exalted Cyclops of his local chapter. After leaving the group, Byrd spoke in favor of the Klan during his early political career. Byrd wrote a letter in 1946 to the group's Imperial Wizard stating \\"The Klan is needed today as never before, and I am anxious to see its rebirth here in West Virginia.\\" However, when running for the United States House of Representatives in 1952, he announced \\"After about a year, I became disinterested, quit paying my dues, and dropped my membership in the organization. During the nine years that have followed, I have never been interested in the Klan.\\" He said he had joined the Klan because he felt it offered excitement and was anti-communist. Byrd later called joining the KKK \\"the greatest mistake I ever made.\\"\\"Sen.

Byrd, a Democrat, eventually became his party leader in the Senate. Byrd later said joining the Klan was his \\"greatest mistake,\\" and after his death, the NAACP released a statement praising Byrd, acknowledging his former affiliation with the Klan and saying that he \\"became a champion for civil rights and liberties\\" and \\"came to consistently support the NAACP civil rights agenda\\". In a 2001 interview, Byrd used the term \\"white niggers\\" twice during a national television broadcast. The full quote ran as follows: \\"My old mom told me, 'Robert, you can't go to heaven if you hate anybody.' We practice that. There are white niggers. I've seen a lot of white niggers in my time. I'm going to use that word. We just need to work together to make our country a better country, and I'd just as soon quit talking about it so much.\\" Byrd later apologized for the phrase and admitted that it \\"has no place in today's society,\\" and did not clarify the intended meaning of the term in his context.Senator Robert Byrd interviewed by Tony Snow, Fox News, taped on March 2, 2001, originally broadcast on March 4, 2001 (posted to YouTube on Jan 17, 2009) = Hugo Black = Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black In 1921, Hugo Black, a Democrat, successfully defended E. R. Stephenson in his trial for the murder of a Catholic priest, Fr. James E. Coyle. E.R. Stephenson's daughter had converted to Catholicism and married a man of Puerto Rican descent, and Coyle had conducted the wedding. Hugo Black got Stephenson acquitted in part by arguing to the jury that Puerto Ricans should be considered black under the South's one drop rule. Black, a Democrat, joined the Ku Klux Klan shortly afterwards, in order to gain votes from the anti-Catholic element in Alabama. He built his winning Senate campaign around multiple appearances at KKK meetings across Alabama. Late in life Black told an interviewer: > at that time, I was joining every organization in sight! ... In my part of > Alabama, the Klan was not engaged in unlawful activities ... The general > feeling in the community was that if responsible citizens didn't join the > Klan it would soon become dominated by the less responsible members.Roger K, > Newman, Hugo Black: a biography (1997) p 97. News of his membership was a secret until shortly after he was confirmed as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Black later said that joining the Klan was a mistake, but he went on to say, \\"I would have joined any group if it helped get me votes.\\"Ball, Hugo L. Black pp 16, 50.Hugo Black's membership was the subject of Ray Sprigle's 1938 series of articles in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, for which Sprigle won the Pulitzer Prize. As the Supreme Court Justice, Black became extremely influential in rulings about the separation of church and state.https://www.economist.com/united- states/2019/03/02/americas-porous-wall-between-church-and-state. Some have argued that his views on the separation of church and state were influenced by the Klan's anti-Catholicism.https://blog.acton.org/archives/64017-kkk-got-way- separation-church-state.htmlhttps://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/honors/315/ Despite his former Klan membership however, Black joined the Supreme Court's unanimous decisions in Shelley v. Kraemer (1948), which outlawed judicial enforcement of racially restrictive covenants, and Brown v Board of Education, which outlawed school segregation. Justice William Douglas would write years later that at least 3 (and possibly as many as 5) Supreme Court justices were originally planning to rule school segregation constitutional, but Black had actually been one of the 4 justices who were planning to strike down school segregation from the beginning of the Brown case.https://thinkprogress.org/brown-v-board-of-education-came-very-close-to- being-a-dark-day-in-american-history-dd231ad0f2f2/ = Theodore G.

New York, 1924, p. 45. = Edmund Pettus = Edmund Pettus (July 6, 1821 ‚Äì July 27, 1907), a Democrat and the U.S. Senator for Alabama, was also a Grand Dragon of the KKK in Alabama. = John W. Morton = John Morton, a Democrat, was the Tennessee Secretary of State and was the founder of the Nashville chapter of the KKK = William L. Saunders = William L. Saunders, a Democrat, was the North Carolina Secretary of State and was the founder of the North Carolina chapter. = John Clinton Porter = John Clinton Porter, a Democrat, was a member of the Klan in the early 1920s and served as mayor of Los Angeles.Kevin Starr, Material Dreams: Southern California through the 1920s (1990), pp 138‚Äì139. = Benjamin F. Stapleton = Benjamin F. Stapleton, a Democrat, was mayor of Denver in the 1920s‚Äì1940s. He was a Klan member in the early 1920s and appointed fellow Klansmen to positions in municipal government. Ultimately, Stapleton broke from the Klan and removed several Klansmen from office.Goldberg, R. (1981). Hooded Empire: The Ku Klux Klan in Colorado. Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press. =David Duke= David Duke (born July 1, 1950), a politician who ran in both Democrat and Republican presidential primaries, was openly involved in the leadership of the Ku Klux Klan. He was founder and Grand Wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in the mid-1970s; he re-titled his position as \\"National Director\\" and said that the KKK needed to \\"get out of the cow pasture and into hotel meeting rooms\\". He left the organization in 1980. He ran for president in the 1988 Democratic presidential primaries. In 1989 Duke switched political parties from Democrat to Republican. In 1989, he became a member of the Louisiana State Legislature from the 81st district, and was Republican Party chairman for St. Tammany Parish. Alleged members of the Klan = Warren G. Harding = The consensus of modern historians is that Warren Harding was never a member, and instead was an important enemy of the Klan. While one source claims Warren G. Harding, a Republican, was a Ku Klux Klan member while President, that claim is based on a third-hand account of a second-hand recollection in 1985 of a deathbed statement made sometime in the late 1940s concerning an incident in the early 1920s. Independent investigations have turned up many contradictions and no supporting evidence for the claim. Historians reject the claim and note that Harding in fact publicly fought and spoke against the Klan. The rejected claim was made by Wyn Craig Wade. He stated Harding's membership as fact and gives a detailed account of a secret swearing-in ceremony in the White House, based on a private communication he received in 1985 from journalist Stetson Kennedy. Kennedy, in turn had, along with Elizabeth Gardner, tape recorded some time in the \\"late 1940s\\" a deathbed confession of former Imperial Klokard Alton Young. Young claimed to have been a member of the \\"Presidential Induction Team\\". Young also said on his deathbed that he had repudiated racism.Kennedy, \\"Woody Guthrie: Natural born anti-fascist\\" , retrieved 9 September 2005.Wade 1987, 165, 477. In his book, The Strange Deaths of President Harding, historian Robert Ferrell says he was unable to find any records of any such \\"ceremony\\" in which Harding was brought into the Klan in the White House. John Dean, in his 2004 book Warren Harding, also could find no proof of Klan membership or activity on the part of Harding. Review of the personal records of Harding's Personal White House Secretary, George Christian Jr., also do not support the contention that Harding received members of the Klan while in office. Appointment books maintained in the White House, detailing President Harding's daily schedules, do not show any such event.Ferrell, The Strange Deaths of President Harding (1996). In their 2005 book Freakonomics, University of Chicago economist Steven D. Levitt and journalist Stephen J. Dubner alluded to Warren Harding's possible Klan affiliation. However, in a New York Times Magazine Freakonomics column, entitled \\"Hoodwinked? Does it matter if an activist who exposes the inner workings of the Ku Klux Klan isn't open about how he got those secrets?\\", Dubner and Levitt said that they no longer accepted Stetson Kennedy's testimony about Harding and the Klan.New York Times Magazine, January 8, 2006, pp. 26‚Äì28 The 1920 Republican Party platform, which essentially expressed Harding's political philosophy, called for Congress to pass laws combating lynching.Republican Party Platform of 1920 (available from the American Presidency Project of the University of California, Santa Barbara ). Harding denounced lynching in a landmark 21 October 1921 speech in Birmingham, Alabama, which was covered in the national press. Harding also vigorously supported an anti-lynching bill in Congress during his term in the White House. His \\"comments about race and equality were remarkable for 1921.‚ÄùJames D. Robenalt, ‚ÄúThe Republican president who called for racial justice in America after Tulsa massacre: Warren G. Harding‚Äôs comments about race and equality were remarkable for 1921‚Äù Washington Post June 21, 2020 Payne argues that the Klan was so angry with Harding's attacks on the KKK that it originated and spread the false rumor that he was a member. Carl S. Anthony, biographer of Harding's wife, found no such proof of Harding's membership in the Klan. He does however discuss the events leading up to the period when the alleged Klan ceremony was held in June 1923: > [K]nowing that the some branches of the Shriners were anti-Catholic and in > that sense sympathetic to the Ku Klax Klan and that the Klan itself was > holding a demonstration less than a half mile from Washington, Harding > censured hate groups in his Shriners speech. The press \\"considered [it] a > direct attack\\" on the Klan, particularly in light of his criticism weeks > earlier of \\"factions of hatred and prejudice and violence [that] > challeng[ed] both civil and religious liberty\\".Anthony 1998, 412‚Äì413. In 2005, The Straight Dope presented a summary of many of these arguments against Harding's membership, and noted that, while it might have been politically expedient for him to join the KKK in public, to do it in private would have been of no benefit to him. = Harry S Truman = Harry S Truman, the Democratic politician who became president in 1945, was accused by opponents of having dabbled with the Klan briefly. In 1924, he was a judge in Jackson County, Missouri. Truman was up for reelection, and his friends Edgar Hinde and Spencer Salisbury advised him to join the Klan. The Klan was politically powerful in Jackson County, and two of Truman's opponents in the Democratic primary had Klan support. Truman refused at first, but paid the Klan's $10 membership fee, and a meeting with a Klan officer was arranged.McCullough 1992, 164. According to Salisbury's version of the story, Truman was inducted, but afterward \\"was never active; he was just a member who wouldn't do anything\\". Salisbury, however, told the story after he became Truman's bitter enemy, so historians are reluctant to believe his claims.Steinberg, 1962. Salisbury was a war buddy and former business partner of Truman's. Salisbury believed that Truman attempted \\"to give Jim Pendergast control of [their] business.\\" Truman alerted federal officials about Salisbury, leading to Salisbury's conviction for filing a false affidavit. Salisbury contradicts Hinde's statement that the meeting at the Hotel Baltimore was one-on-one, naming at least six individuals who were present. Salisbury states that at the meeting, Truman had to receive a special dispensation to join, because his grandfather Solomon had been a Jew; however, Solomon was not a Jew, and the rumor of Truman's Jewish ancestry was only spread later, by the Klan, once the political lines had been drawn so that Truman was the Klan's enemy. According to Hinde and Margaret Truman‚Äôs accounts, the Klan officer demanded that Truman pledge not to hire any Catholics or Jews if he was reelected. Truman refused, and demanded the return of his $10 membership fee; most of the men he had commanded in World War I had been local Irish Catholics.Wade, 1987, 196, gives essentially this version of the events, but implies that the meeting was a regular Klan meeting, rather than an individual meeting between Truman and a Klan organizer. An interview with Hinde at the Truman Library's website (\\"Oral History Interview with Edgar G. Hinde\\" by James R. Fuchs, 15 March 1962, retrieved June 26, 2005) portrays it as a one-on-one meeting at the Hotel Baltimore with a Klan organizer named Jones. Truman's biography, written by his daughter (Truman, 1973), agrees with Hinde's version, but does not mention the $10 initiation fee; the same biography reproduces a telegram from O.L. Chrisman stating that reporters from the Hearst papers had questioned him about Truman's past with the Klan, and that he had seen Truman at a Klan meeting, but that \\"if he ever became a member of the Klan I did not know it.\\" Truman had at least one other strong reason to object to the anti-Catholic requirement, which was that the Catholic Pendergast family, which operated a political machine in Jackson County, were his patrons; Pendergast family lore has it that Truman was originally accepted for patronage without even meeting him, on the basis of his family background plus the requirement that he was not a member of any anti-Catholic organization such as the Klan.McCullough 1992. The Pendergast faction of the Democratic Party was known as the \\"Goats\\", as opposed to the rival Shannon machine's \\"Rabbits\\". The battle lines were drawn when Truman put only Goats on the county payroll,Truman 1973. and the Klan began encouraging voters to support Protestant, \\"100% American\\" candidates, allying itself against Truman and with the Rabbits, while Shannon instructed his people to vote Republican in the election, which Truman lost.Truman 1973; McCullough 1992, 170. Truman later claimed that the Klan \\"threatened to kill me, and I went out to one of their meetings and dared them to try\\", speculating that if Truman's armed friends had shown up earlier, violence might have resulted. However, biographer Alonzo Hamby believes that this story, which is not supported by any recorded facts, was a confabulation based on a meeting with a hostile and menacing group of Democrats that contained many Klansmen, showing Truman's \\"Walter Mitty-like tendency ... to rewrite his personal history\\".Hamby 1995. Sympathetic observers see Truman's flirtation with the Klan as a momentary aberration, point out that his close friend and business partner Eddie Jacobson was Jewish, and say that in later years Truman's presidency marked the first significant improvement in the federal government's record on civil rights since the post-Reconstruction nadir marked by the Wilson administration.McCullough notes this extensively in his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Truman. While Truman had been raised in a family with Southern and Confederate leanings, he still said that he believed \\"in the brotherhood of all men before the law\\" (McCullough, p. 247). His work on civil rights was politically damaging but extensive nonetheless. = Lyndon Johnson = Ned Touchstone claimed the Klan had proof of Lyndon Johnson having been a member early in Johnson's political career, according to a note in documents relating to the John F. Kennedy assassination that were declassified in 2017.  References   Sources  * Anthony, Carl Sferrazza. Florence Harding, New York: W. Morrow & Co. 1998. * Dean, John; Schlesinger, Arthur M.

Its name derives from the fact that in the beginning of this form of transport a flat fee of one peso was charged per ride (hence the name \\"pesero\\" which could be interpreted as \\"peso collector\\"). History =Early history= First seen in the 1970s as the so-called taxi colectivo (share taxi or collective cab), peseros were originally big cars with fixed routes which would pick passengers at any point through their route, and drop them off also at any point. Passenger capacities were limited to those of a large car (usually up to six people plus a driver). Being both cheaper than a proper taxi and able to cover routes not feasible for larger buses or other forms of public transport, by the 1980s, pesero owners started using Volkswagen Microbus vehicles (known in Mexico as combis from its Kombinationskraftwagen variant) for increased capacity of up to 12 passengers. The inability of the government-run public transport to serve the public's needs in a high-growth environment caused high demand and made them a very good business. Pesero owners kept up with demand by adding more units and routes, particularly in newly developing parts of the city such as Nezahualc√≥yotl, and they did so without any centralized planning. By the mid- to-late 1980s, most peseros were converted to gasoline-powered, half-length passenger buses (known as microb√∫s or simply el micro in Mexico, but they are not similar to the VW Microbus vehicles mentioned before). They were capable of carrying around 22 sitting people or up to 50 if standing people are counted =Recent history= To this day, a fleet of approximately 28,000 peseros (as of 2007) carry an important part of Mexico City's public transport passengers, surpassing by far the capacity of the Mexico City Metro, STE trolleybuses, buses and taxis; peseros, (including VW Microbus, micros proper and full-length diesel buses) carry up to 60% of the city's passengers.SETRAVI - official statistics on ground transport in Mexico City - Spanish However, despite the success of the decentralized system in carrying large numbers of passengers for low cost, the government is seeking ways to regulate microbus operation, ostensibly to address problems such as a lack of operator training and documented unit maintenance. Proposed changes include reducing the number of units or replacing them with full-size diesel-powered buses which carry more passengers per unit, and can utilize transfers and/or a unified farecard system, such as the Optib√∫s system that has been implemented in Le√≥n, Guanajuato. Other proposed alternatives include expanding the Metro and STE trolleybus network and different forms of transportation, such as the Metrob√∫s, which has completely replaced pesero travel along Avenida de los Insurgentes avenue, and the Tren Suburbano, which will serve areas north of the city. Unlike most other North American and European cities of similar size, it is not possible to buy a pass or farecard in Mexico City that is valid on all types of transport within the city, rather, each form of transport one boards requires an additional (but low, the Metro fare is only MXN 5 pesos) fare. Organization Pesero drivers do not receive a fixed salary but are required to meet a daily quota prescribed by the owner of the vehicle. The driver is then allowed to keep the rest of fares of the day. This fosters fierce competition among drivers, as every passenger is seen as valuable merchandise towards meeting the quota and thus increasing the driver's personal profit. As a result, often, two or three battered down peseros race furiously against one another with complete disregard for the passengers they carry or for other vehicles. Accidents, often deadly, ensue and are fairly common. However, the lack of any real alternative keep them in high demand throughout the city. Currently peseros travel fixed routes, being able to pick up or drop off passengers anywhere through the route (a major source of traffic problems and annoyance for the sudden and unexpected stops). The fees are according to distance traveled: from MXN $4.00 for a trip of up to 5 km, MXN $4.50 for a 5-to-12 km trip, and MXN $5.50 for a trip of 12 km or more. Routes usually begin in metro stations and end in outlying neighborhoods of the city or sometimes even in municipalities in Mexico State but for this purpose added to the regular fares they need to have an authorized fare by this state(with a Pyramydal Fare Scheme) for Metropolitan routes. Typically, less than $5.00 MXN routes begin in a small metro station that serves only one line, but the number rapidly increases depending on the number of metro lines going through a station. The terminal station of a metro line usually functions as a transport hub and may be served by tens of different pesero routes. In addition, every major avenue in the city is served by at least one pesero route. The lack of organization of the pesero network, there is no comprehensive map of routes available to the general public. Nevertheless, routes each have a route number in order to distinguish them from each other in license plates. Individual peseros also have a sign affixed to the windshield indicating major points covered by the route such as metro stations (denoted by the Metro logo), hospitals, schools, avenues, etc. See also *Dollar van *Marshrutka *Dolmu≈ü *Public light bus Hong Kong *Nanny van *Mexico City Metrob√∫s *Mexico City Metro *Share taxi ‚Äì around the world *Tren Suburbano References Category:Share taxis Category:Transportation in Mexico City Category:Road transportation in Mexico ","title":"Pesero"},{"id":"2514802","text":"Federation Tower at night The Federation Tower () is a complex of two skyscrapers built on the 13th lot of the Moscow International Business Center (MIBC) in Moscow, Russia. The two skyscrapers are named Tower East or Vostok (Russian: –í–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∫; literally means \\"East\\") and Tower West or Zapad (Russian: –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥; literally means \\"West\\"). The supertall skyscraper Tower East (Vostok) is currently the second-tallest skyscraper in Europe and Russia after Lakhta Center, the tallest building in Moscow, and the 55th-tallest building in the world. Zapad is a shorter skyscraper than Vostok and is the 11th-tallest building in Russia. The complex stands on the 13th lot, which has an area of 439,154 square meters. The project was conceived by German-Russian engineer Sergei Tchoban and German professor and engineer Peter Schweger. The complex was designed by architecture companies nps+partner and Schweger Associated Architects. The complex started construction in 2005, with Zapad completed first in 2008 with a height of 242 meters (794 feet). As a result of the Great Recession, construction of the complex stopped until August 2011, and Vostok was completed on December 7, 2017 with a height of 373,7 meters (1,226 feet). In late 2014, Vostok surpassed the South Tower of OKO, which it is also part of the MIBC, as the tallest skyscraper of Russia and Europe. A spire was to be also built which would have extended the complex's height to 450 meters (1,476 feet) as well as provided an observation deck but it was never completed and was dismantled afterward. The complex is owned by the AEON Corporation, a Russian private international investment group. The complex consists of two towers built on one podium. Tower East is a 97-story structure and Tower West is a 63-story structure. Tower East = Planning and early development = The higher tower of the complex located in the eastern part of lot number 13 was formerly known as Tower \\"A\\". But in November 2006, to avoid name competition with Naberezhnaya Tower, it was renamed Tower \\"Vostok (East)\\". Tower East is designed to have 95 above-ground and 3 underground floors, and 17 high-speed elevators will be installed there (JP. Kocher). According to the company Potok, which is the builder of the tower, it used grade B90 concrete which is twice as strong as regular concrete and will allow the skyscraper to withstand a direct hit of an aircraft. In early December 2009, the Potok Corporation management (ex-Mirax Group) announced that in the case of financial problems it could reduce the number of floors of Tower East from 95 to 64 floors. However, in March 2010, the company's management stated that Tower East would be completed according to the original project design. The construction of this tower is the second stage of the entire complex construction, and during the construction of the first tower, \\"Zapad (West)\\", its design underwent some significant changes and became radically different from the original version. In the first place, the square footage of the floors changed, and visually the tower became thicker at the base to the extent that a part of the floors, starting with the 11th, protrude a little beyond the 13th lot borderline. The tower core was significantly revised, too, and now has a trapezoidal shape rather than hexagonal as in the earlier design. The load-bearing columns became twice as thick; therefore, the amount of concrete required for the construction of the columns increased 4 times, and, consequently, significantly increased the total mass of the building. =Construction= Construction started in 2005. During the construction of the foundation slab on 21‚Äì24 February 2007, a new record listed in the Guinness Book of Records was set: 14,000 cubic meters of concrete were placed then. Somewhat unusual in the construction process was that the first base plate was covered with the second base plate, which resulted in the complex losing one underground level and the construction delayed by at least five months. The extravagance of this decision lies in the fact that, judging by the photographs obtained from the site, the builders began active preparations for the construction of the first underground floor, but suddenly stopped working, dismantled the installed cranes, cut the reinforcement bars previously prepared for the columns and began to place reinforcement for the second base plate. That the construction organizers did not clearly comment on the reasons for this decision was also unusual. The tower was climbed solo by the Frenchman Alain Robert in September 2007. In the process of further construction the pace of the tower erection changed over a fairly wide range: the underground and podium parts of the building were being built at an average rate of about two levels a month; after the podium was completed, the construction of standard floors went at a faster rate of four floors per month, while at the technical 33‚Äì34 levels of the building the construction of that floor was significantly suspended and lasted more than five months; one of the cranes was replaced with two more powerful ones, and a strong metal outrigger structure was formed, contributing to the greater rigidity of the building and its resistance to wind loads. As of mid-May 2008, the tower was built to a height of about 170 meters (558 ft). In November 2008, due to the Great Recession and a lack of funding, construction of the skyscraper was suspended. The building is actively used as a sightseeing object and a high- rise structure for extreme sports lovers (base jumpers, climbers, etc.), as well as a site for shooting films and videos (TV shows, advertising, and movie production). In 2012, the Moscow 24 TV channel shot a movie about the business complex. Another film dedicated to the skyscraper was made by the Discovery Channel TV channel in 2009. On July 5, 2011, the construction company Potok announced the tower construction to be resumed. The actual growth of the tower was scheduled to begin in September 2011. As of March 30, 2012, the 67th story of Tower East had been completed; the glazing of the tower was being conducted as well. On April 2, 2012, firefighters and firefighting helicopters struggled to put out a massive blaze that broke out on the 67th floor of the under- construction Federation Tower East. \\"The fire was visible from much of the Russian capital's western half. Two firefighting helicopters noisily circled the blaze, dumping huge buckets of water on the flames before the Emergencies Ministry said the fire had been stopped from spreading by about 11:30 p.m. (1930 GMT), some three hours after it broke out.\\" \\"The area affected by the fire has exceeded 300 square meters (3,229 square feet)\\", Major-General Sergei Anikeyev, deputy head of the city's emergency department, told the news agency Itar-Tass. \\"The 14 people who were at the top floors when the fire started have been evacuated. No one was hurt,\\" he told Itar-Tass. On December 18, 2014, Vostok was topped out when the skyscraper reached its planned height of 374 meters (1,227 feet). The construction teams, including Turner, celebrated the pouring of the last structural concrete cube, 374 meters above the ground. The topping-out generated excitement in the Russian press, as the tower received the title of being the tallest building in Russia and Europe, surpassing OKO's South Tower. On January 20, 2017, Europe's tallest elevator shaft was constructed in Vostok, with the launch of the tallest elevator in Europe taking place simultaneously with the opening of the southern entrance lobby of the tower. According to Russian Construction, the elevator's cabin moves without switches from the second underground level to the 94th story. Schindler freight-passenger elevator will go up at the height of 355 meters above the ground level. Its total path of motion with the consideration of underground floors will amount to 365 meters. The elevator's carrying capacity is 2 tons. During an interview with the director general of the \\"Federation Tower\\" Ltd., Mikhail Smirnov by Iterfax-Realty, construction of the skyscraper would finish by the end of March 2017. Earlier, the Moscow State Construction Supervision Committee reported that the tower would be put in operation by July 2017, Interfax reports. On October 6, 2017, the Lakhta Center of St. Petersburg surpassed Vostok's height of 1,227 ft (374 m), making it the tallest building in Russia and Europe. On December 7, 2017, construction of Vostok was completed, making it the tallest completed skyscraper in Russia and Europe currently. = Purpose = 240px Vostok would be used for mixed-use, high rise development designed to house offices, retail areas, a five star hotel, and luxury apartments upon completion. A number of luxurious offices will occupy the penthouse‚Äôs area of 12,000 square meters from the 90th to 98th stories. The upper levels of the 95-story tower will include the hotel lobby, restaurants, and a public viewing platform. The lower levels will contain retail shops and restaurants as well as the hotel‚Äôs ballroom, and conference and events center. The building would also feature the highest digital clock in the world. Tower West = Planning and early development = The lower tower of the complex is located on the western part of lot 13 in the MIBC. The tower was formerly known as Tower \\"B\\" but in order to avoid name competition with Naberezhnaya Tower, it was renamed Tower \\"Zapad (West)\\". In November 2006, after the name competition, it was renamed Tower West. Tower West is planned to have 62 stories above ground and four underground floors, with 11 twin and six high-speed elevators. =Construction= The erection of Tower West was the first stage of the entire Federation complex construction, but the height of the tower was increased in comparison with the original models (originally, Tower West was planned to be half the height of Tower East). The cross-section of the tower's core, originally planned to be hexagonal, was modified after construction began and is now trapezoidal. The core was constructed so it rose above the rest of the structure, which was assembled one or two floors behind. The building was completed in early 2008. = Purpose = Tower West would include a hotel spa and swimming pool. The 61st floor of the Tower West accommodates the tallest restaurant in Moscow, 'Sixty', run by Ginza Project. =Awards= * 2009 ‚Äì The western tower of the Federation business complex was the winner of the World FIABCI competition Prix d'Excellence in the category \\"Office Property\\". * 2011 ‚Äì The Federation Tower was awarded with the \\"Records of real estate market\\" prize in the \\"Business Center No 1\\" nomination.

It does not have a community council. The village is situated some 4.5 miles (7 km) north-east of Swansea city centre, between the flood plain of the River Tawe and Mynydd Drumau (Drummau Mountain). Birchgrove also borders Neath Port Talbot. The community of Birchgrove, which includes the village of Birchgrove itself, Lon-las, and parts of Glais, had a population in 2008 of 5,807.Davies (2008), pg 844. and 7,392 in 2011.  Locality  Long vistas of the Swansea, Neath and Blaengwynfi valleys are to be had from the top of Mynydd Drumau, as well as a clear view of the Devon coast across the Bristol Channel. Education Birchgrove has a primary and a comprehensive secondary school, both of which are state-run, mixed, and non-denominational. Birchgrove Comprehensive School was opened in 1991 in the grounds of the old junior school. It serves the areas of Birchgrove, Glais, and Clydach. Most of the pupils attending Birchgrove Primary School move on to Birchgrove Comprehensive at age 11. However, many pupils from Glais and Clydach attend Cwmtawe Community School in nearby Pontardawe, while a number of pupils from Llansamlet and Trallwn attend Birchgrove instead of Cefn Hengoed Community School in Winch Wen.  History  = Prehistory = The countryside surrounding Birchgrove is scattered with prehistoric sites. There are numerous barrow mounds and evidence of prehistoric dwellings. Carreg Bica is a large standing stone on Drummau Mountain. The stone is local sandstone and is around 13 ft high. The name means \\"pointed stone\\" in the Welsh language. The stone is also known by other names: Maen Bredwan or Maen Bradwen. It is also mentioned in a charter to King John to William de Breos in 1203 as \\"meynhirion\\", as a boundary stone marking the Gower. There is a legend of the stone moving and going to a local stream to drink or bathe. In this case the stone is said to bathe in the river Neath once a year on Easter morning. Children from Skewen were said to race to the stone on Easter morning. Cistercian monks built the nearby Neath Abbey in the early 12th century. Wintering their flocks and herds in the few open spaces down in the valley, during the other seasons keeping them in their specially constructed stone walled fields on Drummau mountain top, using the standing stone as a landmark. Many sections of the stone walls are still standing from Cistercian times. = Industrial era = From an early date to the beginning of the 19th century, coal-mining played an important role in Birchgrove. It was mainly on coal-mining that the villages of the parish grew, and Birchgrove was no exception. Mining played a very important role in the industrial development of the lower Swansea Valley, which was becoming the metallurgical centre of the world. (See History of Swansea.) Coal was replacing wood in the smelting of ores; and it was because of the demand for coal that a pit was sunk in Birchgrove, known as Birchgrove Colliery Company, locally known as the 'Old Pit'. It was situated just below the Birchgrove Post Office. It was sunk in 1845, to a depth of approximately 100 feet. As a result of its prosperity, two further pits were sunk, namely Sisters Pit, and Brothers Pit. Approximately 200 worked at the Old Pit. This involved many new people coming into the area, to work in both mining and the copper industry. The only cultural recreation was a Reading Room, situated near the colliery. It was not used on Sundays, so the people of the village were given permission to use it for Sunday worship. Services were held there according to the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England (the Church in Wales not being founded until 1920). The services held there were well supported. The Birchgrove Colliery was closed in 1931. There are still relics of Birchgrove's industrial past in the area, The ruins of Scot's pit pump house dominate the lower end of Birchgrove and evidence of mine workings can still be found.

The songs became classics and Runjiƒá helped the careers of many notable Croatian musicians such as Oliver Dragojeviƒá, Doris Dragoviƒá and Meri Cetiniƒá. He was especially successful at the prestigious Split Music Festival. He wrote almost 700 songs which sold several million copies in both albums and singles.

In humans, phenylacetone occurs as a metabolite of amphetamine and methamphetamine via FMO3-mediated oxidative deamination. Synthesis One method of creating phenylacetone is via: : phenylacetic acid (C8H8O2) -> acetic anhydride (C4H6O3) -> pyridine catalyst -> phenylacetone (C9H10O) + carbon dioxide (CO2) + water (H2O) Sodium acetate has been used instead of pyridine.https://archive.org/details/secrets-of-methamphetamine- manufacture-5th-edition-uncle-fester/page/8/mode/2uphttps://www.designer- drug.com/pte/12.162.180.114/dcd/chemistry/p2p.phenylacetic.html / https://www.astm.org/DIGITAL_LIBRARY/JOURNALS/FORENSIC/PAGES/JFS13235J.htm.

The name Korando is a contraction of \\"Korea Can Do\\". The Korando brand is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as Korea‚Äôs longest surviving name plate.  First generation (1982‚Äì1996)  In 1964, Ha Dong-hwan Motor Company began to assemble Jeeps, trucks, and buses for the US armed forces and for the United Nations Command. In November 1969, the CJ-5 entered production with the Willys Hurricane inline-four engine and in 1971, a ten-seater version and a pickup model were introduced. In April 1974, American Motors and Shinjin Motors formed a joint venture, Shinjin Jeep Motors, to build local Jeeps. Sold under the Asia Motors badge, military Jeeps were built (M38A1, M606) as the Asia KM410. This range eventually developed into the Asia Rocsta. The civilian CJ-5 Jeep was built as the Asia Landmaster from September 1974, with a long- wheelbase model added in 1977. These originally had a locally built AMC 258 ci straight-six engine with SAE, but after the oil crises of the seventies Isuzu's 2.8-liter 4BA1 diesel engine with SAE was introduced in July 1979. Troubled AMC withdrew from South Korea in August 1978. Shinjin Motors sold a shipment of Jeeps to Libya in 1979, in spite of the embargo, and this led to another ownership shakeup as it invalidated the license. Keohwa Co Ltd took over production in March 1981, and rotated the bars in the grille to minimize the resemblance to a Jeep. It remained available on two wheelbases of , with the AMC inline-six or the Isuzu 2.8-liter diesel. In November 1982, the nine- seater \\"Family Deluxe\\" was introduced, and the range was renamed \\"Korando\\" in March 1983. A Korando K9 with extended wheelbase. Keohwa was absorbed by Dong-A Motor in December 1984, and a facelift followed in March 1985. The new model had a changed interior and the large diesel was replaced by the 2238 cc Isuzu C223 engine. The pickup version was discontinued. In June, Isuzu's 2-liter G200Z petrol engine was added. In 1986, Korandos were exported to Japan; and in 1988, SsangYong began exporting them to Europe. In November 1986 Dong-A was integrated into the SsangYong Group, who changed the company's name to SsangYong Motor Company in March 1988. Unlike the CJ-7, a 9-seat extended version was also available, called the Korando K9. In late 1988 a new SUV on the chassis of the Isuzu Trooper was introduced, called the SsangYong Korando Family, but this car has no relation to the Jeep CJ-7 beyond the \\"Korando\\" nameplate. Production of the Jeep-based Korando ended in 1996.  Second generation (1996‚Äì2006)  The second generation \\"New\\" Korando was released in Asia in 1996 to complement the SsangYong Musso (released in 1993), released in Europe in 1997 and in Australia in 1998 and was based on a shortened version of the Musso's chassis. The 1.8 tonne 3-door mini SUV was designed by Professor Ken Greenly. It features a choice of 2.3- and 3.2-liter gasoline engines, or 2.3- and 2.9-liter diesel engines, all produced on license from Mercedes-Benz, accompanied by a five-speed manual Borg-Warner gearbox. The interior of the second generation Korando was unique because it had a steering wheel arch on either side. This was to make converting to right-hand-drive easier and to cut down on production costs. On the passenger's side, a handle was fitted in the arch. This generation was sold as the Daewoo Korando from 1999 to 2001, as Daewoo bought a majority stake in SsangYong, but was later forced to sell its shares. = Revision = Production of the second generation ended in 2006. Sales however in many markets continued through to 2007 due to remaining stock. It was available with a variety of petrol and diesel engines, including a 2.9-liter five-cylinder diesel from Mercedes-Benz. In 2008, Russian TagAZ, under license, began to assemble the Korando as the TagAZ Tager, not only three-door guise, but also in a specific five-door long wheelbase version. In 2017, SsangYong previewed a concept car called the XAV Adventure, which had design features heavily inspired by the second generation of Korando. = Gallery = File:SsangYong Korando Fun Heck.JPG  Korando cabrio File:SsangYong Korando rear 20080711.jpg  Rear view of the hardtop model File:OM662.jpg  The 2.9-liter Mercedes-Benz engine used in the Korando File:Tagaz Tager.jpg  TagAZ Tager 3-door File:Tagaz Tager 5 door.JPG  TagAZ Tager 5-door  Third generation (C200; 2010‚Äì2019)  SsangYong Korando 1st facelift SsangYong Korando rear SsangYong Korando 2nd facelift The third generation Korando, codenamed the SsangYong C200 began production in late 2010. It is to be the first car to be released as part of SsangYong's revised lineup. It has slightly longer wheelbase than its rivals, the Hyundai ix35 and Kia Sportage. The decision to name the C200 the Korando was done so by SsangYong. The car will be sold in Russia as the SsangYong New Actyon. In 2013, SsangYong introduced facelift version of Korando. They re-designed front grille with new headlights include LED daytime running lamp, and rear combination lamp. In 2016, SsangYong replaced Korando's 2.0 liter diesel engine to 2.2 liter diesel engine with Euro 6 compliance. In 2017, 2nd facelift version revealed. = Features = The third generation Korando was initially released with a 6-speed manual transmission and a 6-speed M11 automatic transmission and is in production from May 2011 to 2015. Since 2015, SsangYong replaced Korando's automatic gearbox to Aisin 6-speed transmission. It is also to be offered as a front-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive from launch. Its combined fuel consumption is 5.5 L/100 km and acceleration from 0‚Äì100 km takes less than 10 seconds. The engine available upon release was a 2.0 liter turbodiesel producing 175 horsepower. Petrol engine was introduced in 2012. The Korando comes with 6 airbags as standard. The trunk capacity is 480 liters; however this can be expanded to 1300 liters when the seats are folded down. = Reception = The new Korando was well received from a design perspective with many reviewers noting design improvements over previous models. Interior space too, was praised, as was the all-new monocoque chassis. It became SUV of the year in Macedonia for 2012. = Concept models = Since 2008, five concept cars (some named C200) have been unveiled:  C200  The original concept, the C200, debuted at the 2008 Paris Motor Show and has since been shown at many others. The concept received mostly positive feedback and was thought by many to be the vehicle that can turn SsangYong's reputation for having cars with questionable styling around.  C200 Aero  The concept car C200 Aero made its debut at the 2009 Seoul Motor Show. It was released one year later as Korando C with almost no modification of the original Giugiaro design. SsangYong C200 Eco at the 2009 Sal√≥n Internacional del Autom√≥vil in Barcelona  C200 Eco  The C200 Eco made its debut at the 2009 Seoul Motor Show. It is a hybrid which uses both a diesel engine and an electric one (powered by a 340 volt battery). It also uses a stop-start system which shuts off the engine during stops. Fuel saving will be around 25%. The interior features a green trim and an airy cabin.  Korando C  Launched at the 2010 Busan International Motor Show, the new Korando C concept has stayed mostly the same as the previous concepts but has more aggressive styling and is said to be a representation of the production version. Performance-wise, the new concept has a 2.0-liter turbo-diesel engine and a confirmed power output of and of torque. The interior is similar to that of the C200 Eco.  Korando EV  Launched at the 2010 Busan International Motor Show, the Korando EV was a fully electric concept car based on the Korando C. It has a top speed of 150 km/h, and a range of 180 km. Fourth generation (C300; 2019‚Äìpresent) SsangYong Korando C300 Interior On January 28, 2019, SsangYong released a teaser image and video of the new Korando. The Korando was launched in South Korea on February 26, and debuted to the global market in Geneva Motor Show 2019. The Korando is offered with a choice of 163 horsepower 1.5-liter turbo petrol or 136 horsepower 1.6-liter diesel engine and is available in two or four-wheel drive. And it is equipped with 6-speed manual transmission or 6-speed AISIN automatic gearbox. =Safety= Euro NCAP test results for a SsangYong Korando 1.6 diesel, LHD, 5-door SUV variant with standard safety equipment on a 2019 registration:  References   External links  * * SsangYong Motor > Product (Ï†úÌíà) > Korando (ÏΩîÎûÄÎèÑ) Korando Category:Cars introduced in 1996 Category:Compact sport utility vehicles Category:Crossover sport utility vehicles Category:Mini sport utility vehicles Category:2000s cars Category:2010s cars ","title":"SsangYong Korando"},{"id":"2514847","title":"Capital Cargo International Airlines"},{"id":"2514849","text":"Famous Chicken Kabiraji Cutlet from India Cutlet (derived from French c√¥telette, c√¥te, \\"rib\\") refers to: # a thin slice of meat from the leg or ribs of veal, pork, chicken, or mutton # a dish made of such slice, often breaded (also known in various languages as a cotoletta, Kotelett, kotlet or kotleta) # a croquette or cutlet-shaped patty made of ground meat # a kind of fish cut where the fish is sliced perpendicular to the spine, rather than parallel (as with fillets); often synonymous with steak # a prawn or shrimp with its head and outer shell removed, leaving only the flesh and tail # a mash of vegetables (usually potatoes) fried with bread  American and Canadian cuisines  From the late 1700s until about 1900, virtually all recipes for \\"cutlets\\" in English-language cookbooks referenced veal cutlets. Then pork cutlets began to appear. More recently, in American and Canadian cuisine, cutlets have also been made using chicken, although this was also imported from Europe. The cutlet is usually coated with flour, egg and bread crumbs, then fried in a pan with some oil.  Austrian cuisine   Australian cuisine  Australians eat lamb cutlets battered with egg yolk and breadcrumbs. Chicken cutlets are also very popular, but known as chicken schnitzel. Both lamb cutlets and chicken schnitzel are a staple of Australian children's cuisine. Amongst most Australians of Italian descent, the term schnitzel is replaced by the term cutlet. Cutlets amongst this population are usually veal or chicken.  British cuisine  In British cuisine a cutlet is usually unbreaded and can also be called a chop.Pork cutlet with broad beans, wild mushroom and sage, Telegraph If referring to beef, more than one piece together would be generally called a rib of beef or a rib joint, whilst lamb ribs are called a rack, or rack of lamb. Lamb racks can also be tied into a circular shape before cooking, with the ribs on the outside, giving a crown shape, leading to the name \\"crown of lamb\\".  German cuisine   Hong Kong cuisine  In Hong Kong, the cutlet was introduced during the period of British colonial occupation along with other cooking influences. It is seen as \\"sai chaan\\" or Western cuisine. Veal, pork and chicken are battered and deep fried for lunch. Seafood such as shrimp or scallop that is battered or breaded and deep fried such as can also be known as 'cutlet' in Hong Kong. It is usually served alongside rice or spaghetti noodles.  Indian cuisine  In Indian cuisine, a cutlet specifically refers to mashed vegetables (potato, carrot, beans) or cooked meat (mutton, beef, fish or chicken) stuffing that is fried with a batter/covering. The meat itself is cooked with spices - onion, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, coriander (cilantro), green chillies, lemon and salt. This is then dipped in an egg mix or Corn starch and then in Bread crumbs (also see breaded cutlet), and fried in ghee or vegetable oil. Mostly chicken and mutton cutlets are very popular snacks in the city of Kolkata. The vegetarian version has no meat in it, instead the filling is a combination of mashed potatoes, onion, green chillies, spices and salt, cooked for a bit together. This version is more popular with the vegetarian Indian population. An example is the Aloo Tikki.  Iranian cuisine  Iranian cutlets In Iran, cutlet (Persian: ⁄©ÿ™ŸÑÿ™) is a popular hamburger-like thin layered fried of mixture of ground beef, mashed potatoes, eggs, onions, spices and bread crumbs.  Italian cuisine  The use of the cutlet (cotoletta) is quite widespread in Italian cuisine in many different variations. The most famous variant is the Milanese cutlet (cotoletta alla milanese), a veal cutlet covered in bread crumbs and fried in butter. It should not be mistaken for the Wiener schnitzel (which should be referred as a scaloppina alla viennese, or as fettina impanata in Italian), because it's a different cut of meat; the Milanese cutlet cut includes the bone, whereas the Wienerschnitzel doesn't. It is disputed whether the cotoletta alla milanese originated the Wienerschnitzel, or vice versa.  Japanese cuisine  The cutlet was introduced to Japan during the Meiji period, in a Western cuisine restaurant in the fashionable Ginza district of Tokyo. The Japanese pronunciation of cutlet is katsuretsu. In Japanese cuisine, katsuretsu or shorter katsu is actually the name for a Japanese version of the Wiener schnitzel, a breaded cutlet. Dishes with katsu include tonkatsu and katsudon.

Cuisines of Russia, Ukraine and other countries of former Soviet Union  In modern Russian, the word kotleta (–∫–æ—Ç–ª–µ—Ç–∞) refers almost exclusively to pan-fried minced meat croquettes / cutlet-shaped patties. Bread soaked in milk, onions, garlic, and herbs is usually present in the recipe. When in a hurry, a \\"cutlet\\" can be eaten between bread slices like a hamburger, but this fast meal is rarely served in restaurants. It is usually served with pan-fried potatoes, mashed potatoes, pasta, etc. In the middle of the 20th century, industrially produced, semi-processed ground meat cutlets were introduced in the USSR. Colloquially known as Mikoyan cutlets (named after Soviet politician Anastas Mikoyan), these were cheap pork or beef cutlet-shaped patties which resembled American burgers. In Ukrainian cuisine, a variety called sichenyk () is made of minced meat or fish and vegetables and covered with bread crumbs. A particular form of the Russian kotleta known as Pozharsky cutlet is an elaborated version of minced poultry kotleta covered with breadcrumbs. A distinct feature of this cutlet is that butter is added to minced meat, which results in an especially juicy and tender consistency. Another Russian version of a cutlet, called otbivnaya kotleta (), meaning \\"beaten cutlet\\", is a fried slice of meat, usually pork or beef, beaten flat with a tenderizing hammer or knife handle and covered with beaten eggs, dough or breadcrumbs. The recipe is similar to those of escalopes, schnitzel, Polish, or American cutlets. Today, this dish is simply called otbivnaya, with the word kotleta reserved for minced meat patties. Chicken Kiev is called kotleta po-kievski () in Russian and similarly kotleta po-kyivski () in Ukrainian, which means \\"Kiev-style cutlet\\".

Usually the fish and potatoes are mixed with spices, green chilies and onions and dipped in a batter made of flour and eggs before being crumbed and fried.

F. Schumacher. The phrase \\"Small Is Beautiful\\" came from a principle espoused by Schumacher's teacher Leopold KohrDr. Leopold Kohr, 84; Backed Smaller States, New York Times obituary, 28 February 1994. (1909‚Äì1994) The concept is often used to champion small, appropriate technologies or polities that are believed to empower people more, in contrast with phrases such as \\"bigger is better\\". First published in 1973, Small Is Beautiful brought Schumacher's critiques of mainstream economics to a wider audience during the 1973 energy crisis and the popularisation of the concept of globalization. Compare: Statistical usage of the term 'globalization' In 1995 The Times Literary Supplement ranked Small Is Beautiful among the 100 most influential books published since World War II.The Times Literary Supplement, October 6, 1995, p. 39 A further edition with commentaries was published in 1999. Schumacher, E. F.; Small Is Beautiful: Economics As If People Mattered : 25 Years Later...With Commentaries (1999). Hartley & Marks Publishers Synopsis The book is divided into four parts: \\"The Modern World\\", \\"Resources\\", \\"The Third World\\", and \\"Organization and Ownership\\". Part I summarizes the Economic world of the early 1970s from Schumacher's perspective. In the first chapter, \\"The Problem of Production\\", Schumacher argues that the modern economy is unsustainable. Natural resources (like fossil fuels), are treated as expendable income, when in fact they should be treated as capital, since they are not renewable, and thus subject to eventual depletion. He further argues that nature's resistance to pollution is limited as well. He concludes that government effort must be concentrated on sustainable development, because relatively minor improvements, for example, technology transfer to Third World countries, will not solve the underlying problem of an unsustainable economy. Schumacher's philosophy is one of \\"enoughness\\", appreciating both human needs and limitations, and appropriate use of technology. It grew out of his study of village-based economics, which he later termed Buddhist economics, which is the subject of the book's fourth chapter. Part II casts Education as the greatest resource, and discusses Land, Industry, Nuclear Energy and the human impact of Technology. Part III discusses the gap between the center of the World System and the developing world as it existed then, with a focus on village culture and unemployment in India. Part IV presents a sketch of a Theory of Large Scale Organization, refutes and exposes some commonplace and false platitudes about Capitalism as a social order and discusses alternatives. Chapter 3 of this part concludes with advice to Socialists (who presumably are at the Commanding Heights): > \\"Socialists should insist on using the nationalised industries not simply to > out-capitalise the capitalists ‚Äì an attempt in which they may or may not > succeed ‚Äì but to evolve a more democratic and dignified system of industrial > administration, a more humane employment of machinery, and a more > intelligent utilization of the fruits of human ingenuity and effort. If they > can do this, they have the future in their hands. If they cannot, they have > nothing to offer that is worthy of the sweat of free-born men.\\"p. 261 1975 > Paperback Edition SBN 06-080352-5 See also * A Guide for the Perplexed * Appropriate technology * Distributism * Humanistic economics * Moderately prosperous society (literally small abundance/well being society AKA \\"The Chinese Dream\\") * Simple living  References  External links * Full Text of Small is Beautiful at ditext.com * The Schumacher Institute for Sustainable Systems home page Category:1973 non-fiction books Category:Appropriate technology advocates Category:Blond & Briggs books Category:Environmental non-fiction books Category:Simple living Category:Sustainability books Category:Words and phrases introduced in 1973 Category:Quotations from literature ","title":"Small Is Beautiful"},{"id":"2514851","text":"The Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto is a congregation of the worldwide Metropolitan Community Church movement located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and is a welcoming congregation openly affirming lesbian, gay, bisexual, heterosexual and transgender people.

History In 1973, a group of individuals wrote to the head office of the Metropolitan Community Church in Los Angeles requesting that they send someone to Toronto to start a new church. In July 1973, Rev. Bob Wolfe arrived in the city and the first worship service was held with 12 people on July 17, 1973. Rev. Wolfe, who died in July 2005, worked hard to establish the new congregation. He became best known for talking a suicidal young gay man down from the roof of Toronto City Hall,\\"Youth threatens City Hall jump, fire chief, minister talk him down\\". The Globe and Mail, January 16, 1974. and used the ceremony where he was honoured by the city to lambaste politicians for failing to reform anti-gay laws.\\"Ad rejected: Pastor airs complaint at council ceremony\\".

Since then its volunteers have provided home hospice care for hundreds of individuals. MCC Toronto have facilitated support groups for HIV, AIDS and other health issues. In 1997, the Church expanded the AIDSCARE program to CommunityCARE and now provides support for clients with a range of illnesses and requirements. In 1991, the church moved to its present location at 115 Simpson Avenue, a building that had been occupied by Simpson Avenue United Church. In 2011, the church received a $1 million donation from philanthropists Margaret and Wallace McCain, the largest single donation ever received by an MCC congregation in the world.\\"MCC Toronto gets $1 million donation\\". Xtra!, January 9, 2011. While the church has not held any state funerals, Rev. Hawkes was the officiant at the state funeral of Jack Layton at Roy Thomson Hall on August 27, 2011. On July 9, 2017, voting members of the congregation voted to elect Rev. Jeff Rock as new senior pastor.\\"Rev. Jeff Rock to lead Toronto LGBTQ congregation\\" . RDNews Now, July 13, 2017. Rock took over the congregation as of October 1, following Hawkes's retirement. LGBT issues MCC Toronto has assisted with the founding of other gay and lesbian groups. It helped organize the first PFLAG meeting and paid for the telephone line in their first year of operation. The church has provided office space for various community groups, such as the Toronto Counselling Centre for Lesbians and Gays, Lesbian & Gay Youth Toronto, and the Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Rights in Ontario. The MCC was also the first organization ever to organize a parade float in Toronto's Pride parade. The congregation has continually supported equality for sexual minorities. This support has included significant legislation: in 1986, they supported Bill 7, adding sexual orientation to the Ontario Human Rights Code; in 1994, they supported Bill 167, which would have changed the definition of \\"spouse\\" in Ontario; in 1996, there were intervenors in the Supreme Court of Canada case of Egan v. Canada in the constitutional question of same-sex spousal recognition under the Old Age Security Act, which resulted in rights of gay and lesbian couples being recognized and sexual orientation being read into the Charter of Rights and Freedoms; in 1999, Rev. Hawkes testified in M. v. H. on spousal support provisions in family law, which held that same-sex couples receive equitable treatment under the constitution. In the fall of 2000, MCC Toronto began working for the legalization of same-sex marriage in Canada. The church's lawyers developed a strategy that was built on a combination of the Ontario Marriage Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. On January 14, 2001, Rev. Hawkes married two same-sex couples but the Registrar General of Ontario refused to register the marriage documents. The church took the provincial government to court and the case was heard in November 2001. The decision was ultimately in the church's favour, although not until the Netherlands and Belgium legalized same-sex marriage. Hawkes served as the grand marshal of the WorldPride parade in 2014.

Overview The IT consulting industry can be viewed as a four-tier system: *Professional services firms which maintain large professional workforces and command high bill rates. *Staffing firms, which place technologists with businesses on a temporary basis, typically in response to employee absences, temporary skill shortages, and technical projects. *Independent consultants, who are self-employed or who function as employees of staffing firms (for US tax purposes, employed on Form W-2), or as independent contractors in their own right (for US tax purposes, on \\"1099\\"). *Information Technology security consultants There are different reasons why consultants are called in: * To gain external, objective advice and recommendations * To gain access to the consultants' specialized expertise * Temporary help during a one-time project where the hiring of a permanent employee(s) is not required or necessary * To outsource all or part of the IT services from a specific company. Prerequisites and major obstacles Once a business owner defined the needs to take a business to the next level, a decision maker will define a scope, cost and a time frame of the project.Kathy Schwalbe. Information Technology Project Management, Fourth Edition, 2005, The role of the IT consultancy company is to support and nurture the company from the very beginning of the project until the end, and deliver the project not only in the scope, time and cost but also with complete customer satisfaction. =Project scoping and planning= The usual problem is that a business owner does not know the detail of what the project is going to deliver until it starts the process. In many cases, the incremental effort in some projects can lead to significant financial loss. One of the important factors is the right choice of technology for the project, as this determines further work. =Business process and system design= The scope of a project is linked intimately to the proposed business processes and systems that the project is going to deliver. Regardless of whether the project is to launch a new product range or discontinue unprofitable parts of the business, the change will have some impact on business processes and systems. The documentation of your business processes and system requirements are as fundamental to project scoping as an architects plans would be to the costing and scoping of the construction of a building. =Project management support= The most successful business projects are always those that are driven by an employee who has the authority, vision and influence to drive the required changes in a business. It is highly unlikely that a business owner (decision maker or similar) will realize the changes unless one has one of these people in the employment. However, the project leadership role typically requires significant experience and skills which are not usually found within a company focused on day-to-day operations. Due to this requirement within more significant business change projects/programs, outside expertise is often sought from firms which can bring this specific skill set to the company. IT consulting skills An IT consultant needs to possess the following skills: * Advisory skills * Technical skills * Business skills * Communication skills * Management skills * Advisory language skills * Business and management language skills * Technical language skills Consulting fees Under normal circumstances a fee for IT consulting is measured on a per day, per consultant basis. There is however an alternative option; fixed fee IT consulting. A fixed fee IT consulting contract applies only to projects which are well- defined, for example: *Infrastructure refreshment projects *Network design *Implementation of specific well-described features, such as monitoring platforms *Infrastructure capacity planning Generally, fixed fee IT consulting is for a specific amount of work, within a defined timeframe. Many companies are now moving towards a fixed priced IT consulting model. This trend is expected to continue as more companies now require delivery of IT Consulting services within a defined time and price structure. Open-ended consultancy models generally favor the consulting firm, as the consultancy firm is rewarded on a per day basis, there is no incentive to complete assignments within a fixed time. The result often being risk of project and cost overrun. Management consulting and IT consulting There is a relatively unclear line between management consulting and IT consulting. There are sometimes overlaps between the two fields, but IT consultants often have degrees in computer science, electronics, technology, or management information systems while management consultants often have degrees in accounting, economics, Industrial Engineering, finance, or a generalized MBA (Masters in Business Administration). According to the Institute for Partner Education & Development, IT consultants' revenues come predominantly from design and planning based consulting with a mixture of IT and business consulting. This is different from a systems integrator in that you do not normally take title to product. Their value comes from their ability to integrate and support technologies as well as determining product and brands.

In 2005, Standard Federal was the largest bank in Michigan based on number of retail branches (265), ATMs (more than 1,000) and deposits (US 23.3B, 15.06% market share); it ranked second in assets. After ABN AMRO acquired it, the bank was renamed LaSalle Bank Midwest in 2005. Bank of America purchased the bank and its parent LaSalle Bank Corporation on October 1, 2007 and all branches were rebranded Bank of America on May 5, 2008. History Standard Federal began as Standard Savings & Loan Association; established on April 25, 1893, assuming the charter of the Workman's Savings and Loan Association. Offices opened in the basement of the old McGraw Building at the corner of Griswold and Lafayette in downtown Detroit. Standard moved to a larger building at the corner of Griswold and Larned Streets in 1914. It purchased land in 1927 and constructed its own headquarters at the northwest corner of Griswold and Jefferson in 1927. This lot was known as \\"the Cornerstone of Detroit\\", as it was the site of the first building ever raised in the city: Ste. Anne's Church, built July 26, 1701. In that year assets surpassed $10 million. \\"Safety For Savings Since 1893\\"... an old Standard slogan that was never tested so severely as during the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression. This helped preclude a serious \\"run\\" on Standard's offices. Standard never closed its doors, surviving with strength through 1929 and through the terrible bank closings of 1933, when many banks opened again. The first branch office opened in 1948 on Grand River near Southfield Road in Northwest Detroit. Standard's name changes over the years reflected growth in its scope and capabilities. After 57 years as Standard Savings & Loan Association, the thrift applied for and received a federal charter in 1950. This expanded its lending powers and Standard became known as Standard Federal Savings & Loan Association. The first branch office outside Detroit city limits opened in 1957 in suburban Royal Oak on North Woodward near 12 Mile Road. Assets meanwhile amounted to $100 million in 1957. =Mergers and acquisitions= In 1970, Birmingham Federal Savings (Michigan) merged with Standard Federal. Main offices moved to Birmingham on Woodward Avenue near Big Beaver Road. Total assets in 1973 reached $1 billion. In 1973, offices moved to a larger building in Troy at 2401 Big Beaver Road. It acquired Wayne Federal Savings (Michigan) in 1975 and in 1980 First Federal Savings of Niles (Michigan) merged with Standard Federal. In 1981, it purchased Landmark Savings and Loan (Saginaw/Bay City, Michigan) and First Savings Association of Dowagiac (Michigan). In the largest merger in Standard Federal's history, it took control of American Federal Savings of Fort Wayne, First Federal Savings of Fort Wayne, Fort Wayne Federal Savings, and South Bend Federal Savings and Loan Association (all of Indiana) in November 1983. The following hear, assets totaled $5 billion. On January 1, 1985, the bank converted from a federally chartered mutual savings and loan association to a federally chartered mutual savings bank and changed its name from Standard Federal Savings and Loan Association to Standard Federal Bank. On August 28, 1986, the bank's board of directors adopted a Plan of Conversion providing for the bank's conversion from a mutual to a stock institution. As of December 31, 1986, Standard Federal had 83 offices in 16 counties in Michigan and Indiana; 78 of which were full-service branches. The conversion from a mutual company to a publicly owned stock company listed on the New York Stock Exchange took place on January 28, 1987. This was one of the largest stock conversions by dollar amount in the history of the thrift industry. Standard Federal completed the acquisition of Tower Federal Savings Bank of South Bend (Indiana) on June 18, 1988. During 1989, the bank acquired two savings institutions in Michigan: First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Kalamazoo (originally known as the Kalamazoo County Building Loan Association) and Peoples Savings Bank, F.S.B. in Monroe. On September 6, 1991, Standard Federal entered the Ohio market, gaining a significant presence in the northwest Ohio area through the acquisition of United Home Federal Savings and Loan Association of Toledo. It purchased First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Lenawee County, Adrian (Michigan) on August 8, 1992. On April 25, 1993, Standard Federal celebrated its centennial. The bank stood as the largest thrift institution in the Midwest and the seventh largest in the United States, with assets of approximately $10 billion. In December of the same year, Standard made its largest single acquisition in history ‚Äî Heritage Federal Savings Bank in Taylor (Michigan). Other acquisitions include InterFirst Bankcorp (1993), Colonial Central Savings Bank (1994) and Fidelity Savings Bank (1996). Effective May 1, 1995, Standard Federal Bank became a wholly owned subsidiary of Standard Federal Bancorporation, Inc., a unitary thrift holding company. =Purchase by ABN AMRO= On November 21, 1996, ABN AMRO reached an agreement to purchase Standard Federal Bancorporation Inc for $1.9 billion; the acquisition completed on May 1, 1997. In 1996, Standard Federal was the largest savings bank in the Midwest, and the fourth largest bank in the State of Michigan. At December 31, 1996, Standard Federal's total assets amounted to $15.7 billion, with total deposits of $11.0 billion, loans serviced for others of $10.5 billion and stockholders' equity of $956.8 million. In 2001, Standard Federal Bank absorbed ABN AMRO's newly acquired Michigan National Bank. The merged bank adopted the acquired bank's national bank charter and the bank became Standard Federal Bank N.A., closing 59 overlapping branch offices and making Standard Federal Michigan's largest bank by the number of branch offices. =Rebranding to LaSalle Bank= On September 12, 2005, ABN AMRO and its American subsidiary LaSalle Bank Corporation officially changed the name of Standard Federal Bank N.A. to LaSalle Bank Midwest N.A. in what it called a \\"brand consolidation\\" instead of a merger with Chicago-based LaSalle Bank N.A. to pool the two banks' marketing resources. =Sale to Bank of America= On April 23, 2007, ABN AMRO announced the sale of LaSalle Bank Corporation to Bank of America for $21 billion, and a net sale of $16 billion after the return of $5 billion in excess capital. A consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland filed a legal challenge to the deal as ABN AMRO did not seek higher bids from other potential purchasers, however, the Dutch Supreme Court ultimately approved the sale. Bank of America closed the purchase on October 1, 2007, and LaSalle Bank Midwest began doing business under the Bank of America brand on May 5, 2008.

The group of potential jurors (the \\"jury pool\\", also known as the venire) is first selected from among the community using a reasonably random method. Jury lists are compiled from voter registrations and driver license or ID renewals. From those lists, summonses are mailed. A panel of jurors is then assigned to a courtroom. The prospective jurors are randomly selected to sit in the jury box. At this stage, they will be questioned in court by the judge and/or attorneys in the United States. Depending on the jurisdiction, attorneys may have an opportunity to mount a challenge for cause argument or use one of a limited number of peremptory challenges. In some jurisdictions that have capital punishment, the jury must be death-qualified to remove those who are opposed to the death penalty. Jury selection and techniques for voir dire are taught to law students in trial advocacy courses. However, attorneys sometimes use expert assistance in systematically choosing the jury, although other uses of jury research are becoming more common. The jury selected is said to have been \\"empaneled\\". Voir dire Depiction of an attorney asking questions during jury selection. Selected jurors are generally subjected to a system of examination whereby both the prosecution (or plaintiff, in a civil case) and defence can object to a juror. In common law countries, this is known as voir dire. Voir dire can include both general questions asked of an entire pool of prospective jurors, answered by means such as a show of hands, and questions asked of individual prospective jurors and calling for a verbal answer. In some jurisdictions, the attorneys for the parties may question the potential jurors; in other jurisdictions, the trial judge conducts the voir dire. The method and scope of the possible rejections varies between countries: * In England, these objections would have to be very well based, such as the defendant knowing a potential juror, to be allowed. * Some jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, and the United States, give both the defense and prosecution a specific number of unconditional peremptory challenges. No justifications have to be brought to exclude a specific juror. Generally, defense attorneys exclude jurors who have professions or backgrounds similar to that of the victim and who could thus feel an emotional link to them, while prosecuting attorneys exclude jurors who might show affinity to the defendant. However, in the United States, if either party excludes a minority group member and the other party challenges, under Batson rules the party exercising the peremptory strike must provide a race-neutral reason for the exclusion (later extended by court rulings to gender-neutral reasons as well). Parties have been known to peremptorily strike jurors based on personal characteristics that wouldn't justify a strike for cause, but which they believe makes the juror less likely to be sympathetic to their side. * In some jurisdictions, attorneys also have the right to make a challenge for cause argument to the judge. This is an argument over whether a juror's particular background or beliefs make them biased and therefore unsuitable for service on the jury. = United States = In the United States the process of voir dire is often much more in-depth than in other countries and its practical implementation is somewhat controversial because of this. The amount of privacy that the potential jurors are afforded when asked questions raises the issue of the definition of \\"impartial jury\\". Some people are skeptical as to whether the intensive questioning of potential jurors looks not just for inherent bias but for a potential to be emotionally swayed. On the other hand, proponents argue that this method gives both sides more confidence in the verdict. = Canada = Part XX of the Criminal Code of Canada allows for a jury in a Canadian murder trial to consist of twelve jurors. However, a minimum of ten jurors and a maximum of 14 jurors may hear the evidence a trial. At the end of the trial, a maximum of twelve jurors and minimum of ten jurors may deliberate. Section 631(2.2) as well as section 643 of the Criminal Code specify that a jury may consist of either 12, 13 or 14 members, however, 12 is most common. Section 631(2.2) allows a judge to order that 13 or 14 jurors be sworn in under certain circumstances. Jurors may also be excused during trial. According to section 644(1) of the Criminal Code, a judge may discharge any juror during the trial due to illness or ‚Äúother reasonable cause‚Äù such as impartiality (see R v Tsouma (1973) and R v Holcomb (1973)). Section 644(2) further specifies that a jury is still properly constituted to complete its duties even if a juror is discharged during the trial as long as the number of jurors is not reduced below ten. At the conclusion of the trial and following the jury charge, a maximum of twelve jurors may deliberate. It requires the judge to pull numbers from a box to determine which jurors should be discharged in order to reduce the number of jurors down to twelve. Jury Identification When empanelling the jury, section 631(3) of the Criminal Code states that the court clerk will draw out the appropriate number of juror cards and read out the name and number of each card in the courtroom. In this sense, the identity of the jurors will be revealed to all parties. However, s. 631(3.1) goes on to say that judge can order that the clerk of the court shall only call out the number on each card, thereby withholding the names of the jury members. This generally takes place upon application by the prosecutor or when the judge deems it necessary in order to protect the safety and privacy of the jury members. Under s. 631(6) of the Code, the presiding judge may then make an order either directing that the identity of a jury member or any information that could reveal their identity not be published or broadcast in any way; or limiting access to or the use of that information. These amendments to s. 361 were introduced in 2001, with the purpose of ‚Äúprotecting jurors from intimidation, and enabling jurors to participate effectively by making them free to act without being subjected to threats, prejudice, intimidation or physical injury‚Äù.R v Jacobson, [2004] O.J. No. 1432 (OSCJ), at para 23 Peremptory Challenges In Canada, the number of peremptory challenges (i.e., challenges for which no reason be given) for jury selection was governed by Section 634 of the Criminal Code of Canada. ¬ß634 of the Criminal Code of Canada was repealed by Bill C-75 which came into effect on September 19, 2019, and peremptory challenges have been therefore eliminated. Challenge for Cause Section 638 of the Criminal Code of Canada provides the basis upon which an individual juror may be challenged for cause. A party seeking to challenge a prospective juror‚Äôs partiality must first demonstrate to the court that there is an ‚Äòair of reality‚Äô to the application.R v Sherratt, [1991] 1 SCR 509 A party may do this by establishing that there is a realistic potential for partiality.R v Williams, [1998] 1 SCR 1128 Section 640 of the Criminal Code sets out the procedures for dealing with a challenge for cause. A challenge for cause based on the enumerated grounds under section 638, other than the juror‚Äôs name not appearing on the panel, will be tried by the last two jurors to be sworn. If no Jurors have been sworn the judge will appoint two persons to try the challenge for cause. Upon application by the accused, the court may exercise its discretion to exclude all sworn and unsworn jurors from the courtroom until the challenge for cause is decided. The two triers of the challenge for cause must decide the question on a balance of probabilities. Pre-Hearing Conference Part XX of the Criminal Code of Canada provides for Procedure in Jury Trials. Section 625.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada is the authority for a pre-hearing conference. A pre-hearing conference is a conference held prior to the beginning of a trial. It is held between the prosecutor and the accused (or counsel for the accused) and is presided over by the court. The purpose of a pre-hearing conference is to promote a fair and expeditious trial. It considers matters that would be better decided before the start of the trial and makes arrangements for the decisions of those matters. Either the prosecutor, defence or the judge may initiate a motion for a pre-hearing conference. A pre-hearing conference is mandatory for any case to be tried by jury (per s. 625.1(2) of the Criminal Code of Canada). It must be presided over by a judge of the court that will try the accused and must be held in accordance with the rules of court made under sections 482 and 482.1. Case Law: A pre-hearing conference judge does not have the jurisdiction to review the Crown disclosure decisions or to order disclosure.R v S (S.S.) (1999), 136 CCC (3d) 477 (Ont SCJ) Death qualification In United States capital cases (cases where the prosecution pursues the death penalty), the jury must often be \\"death-qualified\\". A death-qualified jury is one in which all members of the venire that categorically object to capital punishment are removed. This has the effect of ensuring that the jury will be willing to hand down a sentence of death, if they feel the crime warrants it. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the practice is constitutional. Critics object to death-qualification because empirical evidence. has shown that death-qualified jurors are more likely to convict defendants of crimes than are jurors generally. Assistance of experts In the 1970s and 1980s in the United States, scientific jury selection--the use of expert assistance to more effectively use peremptory challenges -- became more common. The practice has proven controversial because of fears that it gives lawyers the ability to \\"fix\\" the jury and enhances the distorting effect of money. However, research indicates that the effect of the practice is modest at best. Currently, the more generic jury consulting or jury research is increasingly more common as attorneys trying high-stakes cases demand assistance through all parts of the trial process. The still more generic field of trial consulting also contains a myriad of other tools and techniques not directly related to juries. Criticism Jury packing is \\"illegally or corruptly influencing a jury by making available for jury service persons known to be biased or partial in a particular case to be tried\\". The term also is applied pejoratively to jury selection procedures which are legal but perceived as unfair. In the nineteenth century, the prosecution had unlimited peremptory challenges in England and Ireland, whereas the defence were limited to six in England or 20 in Ireland. Peter O'Brien as Crown Prosecutor during the Irish Land War was nicknamed \\"Peter the Packer\\" by supporters of the Irish Land League. The pool from which a jury panel is selected may not have the same demographics as the general population; until the nineteenth century or later in many jurisdictions, jury service, as with the electoral franchise, was restricted to male property owners. In three studies of legal authoritarianism, attitudes toward psychiatrists, and attitude toward the insanity defense were examined as predictors of conviction-proneness in insanity defense cases. Some experts believe that 85% of cases litigated are won or lost in the jury selection phase.

(formerly Standard Federal Bank). With US$116 billion in assets, it was headquartered at 135 South LaSalle Street in Chicago, Illinois. LaSalle Bank Corporation was formerly an indirect subsidiary of Netherlands-based ABN AMRO Bank N.V., one of the world's largest banks, with total assets of EUR 986 billion, more than 3,000 locations in over 60 countries and a staff of more than 105,000. Bank of America acquired LaSalle Bank Corp. effective October 1, 2007, and officially adopted the Bank of America name on May 5, 2008. Corporate Profile =LaSalle Bank N.A.= Founded in 1927 as National Builders Bank of Chicago, it changed its name to LaSalle National Bank in 1940 after a team led by John Nuveen acquired control. In the 1960s LaSalle acquired the Mutual National Bank of Chicago founded by Frank C. Rathje. Algemene Bank Nederland (ABN) acquired the bank in 1979. In a merger of co-owned banks, the LaSalle Bank N.A. name was adopted in 1999. It was the largest bank headquartered in Chicago with US$72.2 billion in assets and US$46.8 billion in deposits. LaSalle Bank maintained 146 retail locations and 450 ATMs throughout Chicago and its neighboring suburbs. LaSalle Bank maintained regional offices in Atlanta, Boca Raton, Boston, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Connecticut, Dallas, Denver, Des Moines, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Nashville, New Jersey, New York City, Omaha, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, St. Louis, Tampa, Troy, Tustin, and Washington, D.C.

Upon the acquisition Nova Global Markets and Nova Holdings became apart the official records. =LaSalle Bank Midwest N.A.= In 1996, ABN AMRO acquired Troy, Michigan-based Standard Federal Bancorporation, the largest savings bank in the Midwest. In 2000, ABN AMRO acquired Michigan National Corporation of Bloomfield Hills and merged it into Standard Federal. The merged bank took the Standard Federal name, but operated under Michigan National's charter. In 2005, it changed its name to LaSalle Bank Midwest N.A. when ABN AMRO consolidated its U.S. commercial banking operations under the LaSalle name. As of 2007, it was one of the largest banks in the Midwest, with US$43 billion in assets and US$24.1 billion in deposits. It operated 264 branches and 1,000 ATMs in Michigan and Indiana. =Sale to Bank of America= On April 23, 2007, an agreement was made to sell LaSalle Bank Corporation to Bank of America for US$21 billion. Bank of America officially took over LaSalle on October 1, 2007.Bank of America  Newsroom - Press Releases This was a defensive move by ABN AMRO to stave off its own purchase by a consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland. RBS wanted to merge LaSalle with its Citizens Financial Group division. At one stroke, this made Bank of America the largest bank by deposits in both Chicago and Detroit; Bank of America previously had a minimal presence in Chicago and none at all in Michigan. The investment banking arm was purchased by the third largest bank in Canada by deposits and market capitalization. Sponsorships LaSalle sponsored a number of events in its Chicago home.

The compact \\"package\\" reactor was designed to produce electricity and generate heat for remote military facilities. The first, the SM-1, served as the Army's primary training facility to train reactor operations personnel from all three services (Army, Navy and Air Force). In 1954, the Department of Defense placed the US Army in charge of all military nuclear power plants except those used for propulsion by the US Navy. The Army's Chief of Engineers established the US Army Engineer Reactors Group in April 1954, and decided to construct the SM-1 facility at the Corps of Engineers headquarters at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, about 18 miles south of Washington, D.C. About 800 personnel were trained on the SM-1 during its operational life, from 1957 to 1973. The power plant was shut down in March 1973, and is monitored within a \\"restricted access\\" section of the post. Inspectors enter the shut-down operations control room every decade or so.THE JOURNAL, online Northern Virginia news, Tuesday 22 March 2011, ‚ÄúA Snippet of History: Fort Belvoir‚Äôs Nuclear Power Plant‚Äù; report by David Kerr; accessed 11 March 2012.

Note the stainless steel reactor containment dome and the proximity of water (top left) in Gunston Cove. (Undated photo, but cars appear to be late-1960s models.) Research and development of the reactor design was conducted in 1952‚Äì54 at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, under the guidance of the Package Power Group. Funding for the reactor was approved in 1954 and bids to construct the facility were received from 18 companies, ranging in price from $2 million to $7 million.ORNL: The First 50 Years; accessed 12 March 2012. According to Time magazine of 18 July 1955, the Army selected the low bid ($2,096,753), submitted by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO Products) of Schenectady, New York, and awarded the contract in December 1954.TIME, 18 July 1955 \\"Atomic Energy: Power Package\\"; accessed 10 March 2012. The name \\"SM-1\\" stands for Stationary, Medium-size reactor, prototype #1. The pressurized-water reactor (PWR) design developed by the AEC was a heterogeneous, water-cooled and water- moderated, stainless steel system, using highly enriched (93%) uranium dioxide mixture as fuel.The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, June 1957 (Vol.13, issue 6: page 229); \\"News Roundup: Package Power Reactor in Operation\\" prepared by Helen C. Allison; accessed 11 March 2012. The term \\"package\\" in the name Army Package Power Reactor refers to the program objective of designing a compact nuclear power plant whose components could be packed for delivery to remote facilities aboard large military transport aircraft. The SM-1 served as the prototype for the SM-1A power plant, which was constructed at Fort Greely, Alaska between 1960‚Äì62. The reactor core itself was compact, about the size of a household dishwasher.ORNL-2128 Reactors- Special Features of Military Package Power Reactors, report of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Applied Nuclear Physics Division, issued 8 August 1956; accessed 12 March 2012. At a press conference held on 19 August 1954, (then) Major General Sturgis, Chief of Engineers, announced the plan by the Army and the AEC to build the \\"package\\" power plant at Fort Belvoir. A location in a \\"closed area\\" of the garrison had been selected, near a point at which Accotink Bay (aka, Gunston Cove) joins the Potomac River. The general said the design of the package reactor resembles the nuclear power plant on the US Navy's (newly launched) nuclear submarine Nautilus. He also said the reactor could be housed in a building 29 feet wide, 42 feet high and 80 feet long. The Army was sending out a request for proposals, that day, to \\"33 qualified bidders\\", and companies were being asked to come up with a \\"competitive lump-sum bid\\", rather than a cost-plus estimate.New York Times, 20 August 1954, page 17; \\"Army Will Build Atom Power Unit\\"; accessed 14 March 2012. On 14 December 1954, the AEC announced that the contract was being given to American Locomotive Company of New York, whose $2 million bid was the lowest of the 18 proposals received.New York Times, 15 December 1954, page 24; \\"Atom Job Given Locomotive Firm\\"; accessed 14 March 2014. Asking companies to submit a lump- sum bid was hailed, at that time, as a sign of how much progress had been made in reactor power plant design by mid-1954, such that companies now had sufficient experience and could calculate costs with confidence. Construction of the building to house the reactor began on 5 October 1955 in the southeast \\"corner\\" of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, alongside Gunston Cove, off the Potomac River. According to a news note in the December 1955 Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, \\"Construction of the 'package' or portable reactor has been started at Fort Belvoir, VA. Alco Products is the contractor for the Defense Department and the AEC. The reactor will generate about 2,000 kilowatts of electricity, enough for a community of about 5,000 people.\\"The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, December 1955 (Vol.11, issue 10: page 378); \\"News Roundup: Package Reactor\\" prepared by Helen C. Allison; accessed 11 March 2012. Alco Products supplied the reactor, pressurizer and steam generator, while Westinghouse Electric Corporation supplied the canned-rotor pumps, General Electric supplied the turbine and generator, the Lummus Company supplied the condenser, and Minneapolis-Honeywell installed the controls. By late October 1955, the Army pushed ALCO to accelerate construction towards a completion date of 10 July 1957.Suid, Lawrence H. The Army's Nuclear Power Program: The Evolution of a Support Agency (Greenwood Publishing: 1990), page 32; accessed 11 March 2012. As a result, all major work was completed by March 1957. Reactor goes critical, April 1957 Construction was completed in 18-months, the SM-1 reactor achieved first criticality on 8 April 1957, and the plant was formally opened in a public ceremony on 29 April 1957. Designed as a small- scale, pressurized-water, commercial nuclear power plant the power output from the SM-1 was connected to the local electrical grid. Thus, the SM-1 and Fort Belvoir hold the distinction of delivering the first nuclear generated electricity for public use in America, coming online several months before the (much larger, $55 million) Shippingport Reactor (in December 1957.)The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, February 1958 (Vol.14, issue 2: page 94); \\"News Roundup: Shippingport Reactor Generates Power\\" prepared by Helen C. Allison; accessed 11 March 2012. According to a June 1957 report in the industry magazine POWER, \\"Normal operation (of the SM-1) will need a total of 29 men. Operators will be high-school graduates with 1-year training, led by engineers.\\"POWER, 15 June 2007, www.powermag.com, \\"Retrospective: June 1957\\"; citing a 1957 report on the SM-1 facility; accessed 10 March 2012. The location of the Army's nuclear reactor training facility alongside Gunston Cove explains why the floating MH-1A came to be tested at Fort Belvoir in April 1966. =Facility hailed as a model for \\"Atoms for Peace\\"= Foreign defense military attach√©s tour the facility about 2 months after it opened. The successful operation of the SM-1 was promoted by the Department of Defense as a demonstration of President Eisenhower's \\"Atoms for Peace\\" program. Shortly after it was placed in operation in 1957, the Pentagon invited a group of foreign defense military attaches stationed in Washington D.C. to tour the Fort Belvoir facility. A 30-second news video of that 1957 visit shows military officers from Cuba, Costa Rica and Portugal, amongst the group invited inside the reactor control room. Reactor closed in 1973, building reopens as museum Plans to decommission the SM-1 reactor were announced in June 1972, and the reactor was shut down for the last time on 16 March 1973: four members of the first group of operators trained in 1957 participated in the shutdown ceremony.Suid, The Army's Nuclear Power Program (1990), page 112. According to a 1998 US Army report on the Army Reactor Program, during its 16 years of operations the facility trained some 800 nuclear operations specialists.NBC Report, Spring/Summer 1998, Army Reactor Program (pp.4-6) \\"Army Reactor Office: The Second Year\\"; by US Army Major Brent B. Bredehoft, Assistant Manager, Army Reactor Program; accessed 10 March 2012. During its operational life, the SM-1 reactor had its core replaced twice. According to a January 2001 report compiled by the Department of Energy, the total amount of uranium-235 supplied for the SM-1's three cores was 72.7 kilograms: the U-235 was enriched to 93 percent. The spent fuel from the first core was sent to the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (the INEEL, originally known as the Idaho National Reactor Testing Station) and the fuel from the SM-1's second and third cores was sent to the Savannah River Site.Federation of American Scientists, \\"Highly Enriched Uranium\\", \\"Appendix D: Military Reactors\\"; accessed 10 March 2012. In April 1975, the reactor building was reopened to the public as a museum until the mid 1980s when it was again closed to the public.

Earlier Egyptologists assumed he was both the High Priest of Amun (HPA) and son of the High Priest Shoshenq C, who may have become a king at Thebes. However, recent research by Karl Jansen-Winkeln shows that all the monuments of the first (King) Harsiese A demonstrate that he was never Theban High Priest of Amun in his own right, merely a regular Priest of Amun.Karl Jansen-Winkeln, \\"Historische Probleme Der 3. Zwischenzeit,\\" Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 81 (1995) pp.129-149 While the earlier Harsiese was certainly a king at Thebes, he is clearly a different person from the later Harsiese, Harsiese B, who is attested as a High Priest of Amun. Jansen-Winkeln further shows that Harsiese A's son, [...du], was only an ordinary Priest of Amun. Harsiese B is first explicitly attested as High Priest of Amun late under Osorkon II's reign on Statue CGC 42225, which bears this king's cartouche. He likely assumed the office at Thebes when the current High Priest, Takelot F, proclaimed himself as king Takelot II in the final 3 years of Osorkon II's reign. Statue CGC 42225 was dedicated by the \\"Letter Writer to Pharaoh\\", Hor IX, who is mentioned on the walls of Temple J at Karnak. Temple J was built in the final years of Osorkon II's reign by the then serving HPA, Takelot F. Hor IX later served under Pedubast I and Usermaatre Meryamun Shoshenq VI, who were direct contemporaries of Shoshenq III of the Twenty- second Dynasty. Shoshenq III once even dispatched his second son, Pashedbast B, to Thebes where the latter \\"added a vestibule door to Pylon X at Karnak, dating it to the reign of Pedubast.\\"David Aston, \\"Takeloth II: A King of the Twenty Third Dynasty?,\\" Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 75 (1989) p.150 Hor IX served beyond the 25-year reign of Pedubast I and lived into Shoshenq VI's reign under whom his funerary cones were inscribed.Aston, op. cit., p.152 Consequently, the High Priest of Amun Harsiese can only be Harsiese B since he was a close contemporary of Hor IX and served late in office under Osorkon II. In contrast, Harsiese A died before the twelfth regnal year of Osorkon II. Harsiese B is also attested in office in the sixth regnal year of Shoshenq III in Nile Level Text No.6 and lived into the 18th and 19th regnal years of Pedubast I as Nile Quay Text No.27 shows. During the prolonged civil war which erupted between the forces of Osorkon B and Pedubast I for control of Thebes, Harsiese B sided with Pedubast's faction since the Karnak Quay Texts show he became the latter's High Priest. He died before Year 23 of Pedubast I when this King's new High Priest is revealed to be a Takelot (see Nile Quay Text No.29) Harsiese B consequently served in office for almost 3 decades under Osorkon II (final three years), Shoshenq III (first 7-8 years) and Pedubast I (at least 18-19 years), and must have been Crown Prince Osorkon B's chief rival for this office at Thebes since he was affiliated with Osorkon's rival. Harsiese B must have been a fairly young man perhaps in his early thirties when he first assumed the Office of High Priest judging by his long career.

The character was originally played by Martin Dingle-Wall from 2001 until 2002. He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 13 July 2001 and departed following his death on 13 February 2006. Development Flynn was a doctor and social worker, who arrived in Summer Bay after leaving the city in search of his missing sister Ashley Saunders (Zoe Ella). When Flynn learns there is a job available at the local drop-in centre, he decided to take it and wait for his sister to pass through the town. Dingle-Wall told an Inside Soap writer, \\"Finding Ashley is number one on Flynn's agenda. She has a drug problem, and could have gone anywhere. But Flynn thinks she may have been heading for the Bay, and he's hoping to be there if, and when, she arrives.\\" Shelley Sutherland (Paula Forrest), who ran the centre, was pleased to have Flynn working there. However, Flynn got off to a bad start with Shauna Bradley (Kylie Watson) and Brodie Hanson (Susie Rugg), who he chased down the beach, after mistaking her for Ashley. Storylines Flynn first arrives in the Bay to help Shelly Sutherland out at the Sarah McKay drop-in centre as a counsellor. It is soon revealed a few weeks after that he is also a trained doctor. Flynn soon falls for Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) and on their first date, they share a picnic together. Shauna Bradley makes a pass at Flynn but he rebuffs her. Jude Lawson (Ben Steel), Shauna's boyfriend is upset and rides off on his motorcycle and crashes. When Jude is brought into hospital, Flynn works with fellow doctor Charlotte Adams (Stephanie Chaves-Jacobsen) to save his life in surgery and they are successful. Flynn later searches for his younger sister, Ashley when their father, John (Bill Charlton) tells him she has gone missing. Ashley is found living rough on the streets and after initial reluctance, she returns home. Following a holiday, Flynn and Sally make engagement plans and marry in an outdoor ceremony conducted by Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn). In 2004, The couple swap houses with Beth Hunter (Clarissa House) and move back into Summer Bay House, Sally's childhood home and take over the running of the caravan park. They then welcome the arrival of their first child, Pippa (Tameka and Bojana Main) via friend and surrogate Leah Patterson (Ada Nicodemou). Flynn and Sally take in homeless teenagers Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) and Cassie Turner (Sharni Vinson) and they form a close bond with them. In late 2005, Flynn is diagnosed with terminal skin cancer which has spread to other areas of his body and is told he only has three months to live. After deciding against chemotherapy, Flynn faces a tough moment when he tells Sally that he wants to take his own life, in order to save himself the pain and humiliation of dying a slow death but Flynn realises how precious his final weeks are and decides to die naturally. When Flynn encounters runaway Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey), she knocks him over while fleeing, exacerbating his weakened state. Flynn spends his final hours reminiscing with Sally, Ric, Cassie and Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) over photos and memories. Flynn shares one last dance with Sally before dying in her arms. Reception For his portrayal of Flynn, Dingle- Wall received a nomination for the Logie Award for Most Popular New Male Talent and the Inside Soap Award for Best Newcomer in 2002. While McIlroy earned a nomination for Most Popular Actor at the Logie Awards of 2006 for his portrayal of the character. McIlroy also received three nominations at the 2006 Inside Soap Awards for Best Actor, Best Couple (shared with Ritchie), and Best Storyline for Flynn's death.

The society was founded by subsequent Nobel laureate Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson on April 7, 1907.  History  Although Riksm√•lsforbundet was founded in 1907 by poet Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson, efforts to organize in support of riksm√•l date back to 1899. It served as opposition to efforts by Norwegians who were organized to promote landsm√•l as the single language for the country. Riksm√•lsforbundet works to preserve and promote riksm√•l, a conservative form of written Norwegian, based on the Danish- Norwegian written language tradition. It consistently opposed the government samnorsk (roughly translated \\"collective Norwegian\\" or \\"together Norwegian\\"; the sam- prefix is related to English same) policy, a now-abandoned project to merge the two main standards of Norwegian (Bokm√•l and Nynorsk) into one standard that would be used everywhere. Prominent members of the riksm√•l movement included the author Jens Bj√∏rneboe, his cousin Andr√© Bjerke, Terje Stigen, Carl Keilhau, Agnar Mykle, Arnulf √òverland, Sigurd Hoel, Johan Bernhard Hjort, Knut Wigert, Margrete Aamot √òverland, Sofie Helene Wigert and Varg Vikernes.¬´Greven¬ª angrer ingenting Among other spokespersons for the riksm√•l cause are authors such as Claes Gill, Nils Kj√¶r, Knut Hamsun, Gabriel Scott and Henrik Ibsen. In recent years a series of language reforms, particularly those of 1981 and 2005, have shown that many of the Riksm√•lsforbundet goals have been achieved. The Samnorsk policy has been officially abandoned. Although not necessarily used by most people, most Riksm√•l spellings are now considered correct in Bokm√•l too, after being banned from schools and the government for several decades as a consequence of the Samnorsk policy. The reform of 2005 was not purely a partial reversal of previous reforms; some new spellings were introduced or excluded too, based on actual use. In addition, there is now a political majority in favor of discontinuing mandatory speech policy in Norway. Riksm√•lsforbundet publishes the magazine Ordet (‚ÄúThe Word‚Äù).

The volunteers cruised mainly at night, assisting police in the search of the unknown murderer known as the \\"Whitechapel Murderer\\", \\"Leather Apron\\" and, latterly, \\"Jack The Ripper\\". Formation The Whitechapel Vigilance Committee was founded by sixteen Whitechapel and Spitalfields tradesmen who were concerned that the killings were affecting businesses in the area.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Facts, p. 119Jack the Ripper - Through the Mists of Time p. 22 This committee was led by a local builder named George Lusk, who was elected chairman during the committee's first meeting on 10 September 1888.

Harris, Hodgins, Houghton, Isaacs, Jacobs, Laughton, Lindsay, Lord, Mitchell, Reeves, and Rogers. The Daily Telegraph reported on 5 October 1888 that the leading members of the committee were \\"drawn principally from the trading class, and include a builder, a cigar-manufacturer, a tailor, a picture-frame maker, a licensed victualler, and 'an actor.'\\"Daily Telegraph 5 October 1888 The latter may have been the entertainer Charles Reeves. =Civic duties= Members of the committee was unhappy with the level of protection the local community was receiving from the police, so it introduced its own system of local patrols, using hand-picked unemployed men to patrol the streets of the East End every evening from midnight to between four and five the next morning. Each of these men received a small wage from the Committee, and each patrolled a particular beat, being armed with a police whistle, a pair of galoshes and a strong stick. The committee itself met each evening at nine in The Crown, and once the public house closed at 12.30 am the committee members would inspect and join the patrols. These patrols were shortly to be joined by those of the Working Men's Vigilance Committee.Sugden Philip 'The Complete History of Jack the Ripper' Robinson, London (1995) Publicity As chairman of the committee, Lusk's name appeared in the national newspapers and upon posters in and around Whitechapel appealing for information concerning the identity of Jack the Ripper and complaining about the lack of a reward for such information from the government. Due to this publicity, Lusk received threatening letters through the post, allegedly from the murderer. Lusk is also mentioned in a letter dated 17 September 1888, reportedly discovered among archive materials in the late 20th century; however, most experts dismiss this as a modern hoax. Members of the Vigilance Committee examine the contents of the box sent to Lusk. On 30 September 1888, the committee members wrote to the government under Lord Salisbury in an attempt to persuade them to offer a reward for information leading to the apprehension of the Whitechapel murderer. When the Home Secretary Henry Matthews refused this request, the committee offered its own reward. The committee also employed two private detectives, Mr. Le Grand (or Grand) and Mr. J. H. Batchelor, to investigate the murders without the involvement of the local police. =Correspondence= The \\"From Hell\\" letter, which was sent with half of a preserved human kidney, was personally addressed to George Lusk, who received the parcel on 16 October 1888.

Slyde was a popular rhythm tap dancer in America in the mid-20th century, when he performed on the nightclub and burlesque circuits. He was also popular in Europe and lived in Paris for a brief period of his life. Slyde appeared in several musicals and shows in the 1980s, and he received numerous awards for his talent. He was known for his signature move, the slide. Early life Godbolt was born in Atlanta and moved to Boston at the age of three. As a child, his mother encouraged him to play the violin, and he enrolled at the Boston Conservatory of Music to advance as a violinist. However, the Conservatory was across the street from Stanley Brown's dance studio, which he would visit to watch great tap dancers such as Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson, John W. Bubbles, Charles \\"Honi\\" Coles, and Derby Wilson. At the age of twelve, Godbolt quit violin lessons at the Conservatory and began tap lessons at Brown's studio with his mother's blessing (she wanted him to do something other than play sports to help contain his energy). At the studio, he studied under Brown himself and a student teacher, Eddie \\"Schoolboy\\" Ford, who taught Godbolt the slide. Godbolt connected with another dancer known for slides, Jimmy \\"Sir Slyde\\" Mitchell, and they put together an act to take on the road. Career In the 1940s Mitchell and Godbolt started performing at local clubs and on the burlesque circuit calling themselves the Slyde Brothers. This in turn caused Godbolt to be renamed forevermore, Jimmy \\"Slyde\\". Their acts included action tricks similar to those the Nicholas Brothers performed; however, they used slides as their trademark move. One dance critic, Sally Sommer, explained his slides as such, \\"He's upstage left and sliding downstage right as fast and smooth as a skier, arms held out to the side, head tilted. He stops the cascade by banking backward, slips into a fast flurry of taps, working quick and low to the floor and ends the phrase by pulling up high and flashing off a triple turn.\\" The act was such a hit, they received invitations to go on the road to perform with big band names of the time, including Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and Barry Harris. Their tapping was part of the bands' songs where they would create the music for many measures and then the band would come back in, and they would trade off back and forth like that the entire act. Unfortunately, the time period in which Slyde's talent emerged was disagreeable, as he became popular in the 1950s when rock and roll was taking the stage and stealing American interest away from big band music with tap acts. He attempted to find work in other cities including San Francisco, Chicago, and Hollywood on the burlesque and nightclub circuits as well as in movies, but work had dried up in America. He found a temporary job working as a choreographer for the tap dancers the Crosby Brothers in the 1960s, but in 1966 Slyde was invited to perform at the Berlin Jazz Festival in Europe. He attended with Baby Laurence, James Buster Brown, and Chuck Green, and the crowd received them with excitement and positive praise including regarding them as \\"Harlem's All-Star Dancers\\". He moved to Paris in the 1970s, where he worked intensively with Sarah Petronio. Petronio nurtured the expatriated Slyde out from self-imposed retirement in France, back into a productive and creative fulfillment and became his dancing partner in Tap and Jazz concerts \\"It's About Time\\", accompanied by some of the Europe's finest jazz musicians. After living, teaching, and performing in Paris, he appeared in the production Black and Blue (1985), which was later reset in New York on Broadway in 1989, in which he also performed. He was nominated for a Tony award for this performance and from then on he felt the tap revival, which led him to stay in the United States and thrive much like during his early career. Throughout his revival and the resurgence of tap in America, Slyde performed in The Cotton Club (1984), Motown Returns to the Apollo (1985), Round Midnight (1986), and Tap, with Gregory Hines and Sammy Davis Jr., in 1989. In the 1990s, Slyde started holding jam sessions every week at a jazz nightclub in New York called La Cave. This became an education-based practice where up-and- coming tappers would come and improvise, while older and experienced tappers would mentor them. Among the mentored included dancers such as Savion Glover, Van Porter, Ira Bernstein, and Roxane Butterfly. Awards Slyde earned many awards including the Choreographer's Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1984, 85, 86, 88, and 1993; as well as a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1999; the Charles \\"Honi\\" Coles Award in 2001; the Hoofer Award of the American Tap Dance Federation in 2002; an honorary doctorate of Performing Arts in American Dance from Oklahoma City University in 2002; the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation fellowship in 2003; and a Dance Magazine Award in 2005. Legacy Slyde died on May 16, 2008, at the age of 80 in his home in Hanson, Massachusetts. He was known for being a great rhythm tapper who had impeccable musicality (partly due to his early music training), perfect timing, and slides that made it appear is if he could glide across the floor effortlessly. His slides were essential to his musicality \\"The slides took on many parts of speech, from little connective scoots to long, stage-traversing slalom runs. Slides allowed him to tease the beat, delaying then catching up. They were silences, visually exciting rests, but they also functioned as long notes, as Slyde's physical dynamics, speeding and slowing, suggested crescendos and diminuendos.\\" He was usually the last dancer to perform because he would top any dancer who rivaled him. However, Slyde was a humble man happy to be part of the tap community, who brought a sound-oriented emphasis to tap and called it \\"a translating thing\\". The younger generation gained knowledge from him and regarded him as one of the greats including Savion Glover who stated he was \\"the Godfather of tap\\" and \\"one of the true masters of the art form\\".

Littorina Sea (also Litorina Sea) is a geological brackish water stage of the Baltic Sea, which existed around 7500-4000 BP and followed the Mastogloia Sea, transitional stage of the Ancylus Lake. This stage and form of the body of water is named after common periwinkle (Littorina littorea), then a prevailing mollusc in the waters, which indicates its salinity. Greater size of the ocean-linked sea is termed a transgression, thus widening its ocean link and reaching a peak of salinity, namely during the warmer Atlantic period of European climatology. At this peak, approximately 4500 BP, the sea bore twice the volume of water and covered 26.5% more land than it does today. As the period ended, modern coast features appeared widely, including the lagoons, spits and dunes at most places. Notable exceptions are steep terraces such as the √òresund where the recession of sea level exposes less dry land. During the period the temperate deciduous forest crept north to cover the littoral hinterland.

Although it remains unbuilt, the notion of and desire for a Third Temple is sacred in Judaism, particularly Orthodox Judaism, and anticipated as a place of worship. The prophets in the Hebrew Bible called for its construction to be fulfilled prior to, or in tandem with, the Messianic Age. The rebuilding of the Third Temple also plays a major role in some interpretations of Christian eschatology. Attempts at rebuilding Since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, religious Jews have expressed their desire to see the building of a Third Temple on the Temple Mount. Prayer for this is a formal part of the Jewish tradition of thrice daily Amidah prayer. Although it remains unbuilt, the notion of and desire for a Third Temple is sacred in Judaism, particularly Orthodox Judaism, and anticipated as a soon-to-be-built place of worship. =Bar Kochba revolt= Initially, the Emperor Hadrian granted permission to rebuild the temple but then changed his mind. The forces of Simon bar Kokhba captured Jerusalem from the Romans in 132 CE, and construction of a new temple continued. The failure of this revolt led to the writing of the Mishna, as the religious leaders believed that the next attempt to rebuild the temple might be centuries away and memory of the practices and ceremonies would otherwise be lost. As punishment for the revolt, the Romans renamed the city to Aelia Capitolina and the province to Syria Palaestina and Jews were prohibited in the city except for the day of Tisha B'av. However, the Rabbis that survived persecution (see Ten Martyrs) were allowed to continue their school in Javnia, as long as they paid the Fiscus Judaicus. =Julian= There was an aborted project under Roman emperor Julian (361‚Äì363 CE) to rebuild the Temple. Julian is traditionally called Julian the Apostate due to his policy of reversing Emperor Constantine's Christianization campaign by restoring traditional religious practices and holy places across the Empire. It was as part of this policy, Julian permitted the Jews to build a Third Temple. Rabbi Hilkiyah, one of the leading rabbis of the time, spurned Julian's money, arguing that gentiles should play no part in the rebuilding of the temple. According to various ancient sources, including Sozomen (c. 400‚Äì450 CE) in his Historia Ecclesiastica and the pagan historian and close friend of Julian, Ammianus Marcellinus,See Britannica Deluxe 2002 and Stewart Henry Perowne the project of rebuilding the temple was aborted because each time the workers tried to build the temple using the existing substructure, they were burned by terrible flames coming from inside the earth and an earthquake negated what work was made: The failure to rebuild the Temple has been ascribed to the Galilee earthquake of 363 CE, and to the Jews' ambivalence about the project. Sabotage is a possibility, as is an accidental fire. Divine intervention was the common view among Christian historians of the time.See \\"Julian and the Jews 361‚Äì363 CE\\" and \\"Julian the Apostate and the Holy Temple\\" . When Julian was killed in battle after a reign of less than three years, the Christians reasserted control over the empire, and the opportunity to rebuild the Temple ended. =Sassanid vassal state= In 610 CE, the Sassanid Empire drove the Byzantine Empire out of the Middle East, giving the Jews control of Jerusalem for the first time in centuries. The new rulers soon ordered the restart of animal sacrifice for the first time since the time of Bar Kochba. Shortly, before the Byzantines took the area back, the Persians gave control to the Christian population, who tore down the partly built edifice, and turned it into a garbage dump, which is what it was when the Caliph Omar took the city in the 630s. =Muslim conquest of Syria= An Armenian chronicle from the 7th century CE, written by the bishop Sebeos, states that the Jews and Arabs were quarreling amongst each other about their differences of religion during the Siege of Jerusalem in 637 CE but \\"a man of the sons of Ishmael named Muhammad\\" gave a \\"sermon of the Way of Truth, supposedly at God's command\\" to them saying that they, both the Jews and the Arabs, should unite under the banner of their father Abraham and enter the Holy Land.Sebeos' History Translated from Classical Armenian by Robert Bedrosian Sebeos also reports that the Jews began a reconstruction of the temple, but the Arabs expelled them and re- purposed the place for their own prayers. In turn, these Jews built another temple in a different location.Sebeos' History, Chapter 31. See also Crone & Cook, Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World (Cambridge University Press, 1977), p. 10; Suermann, H. \\"Early Islam in the Light of Christian and Jewish Sources\\" in Neuwrith, Sinai, & Marx (eds.), The Qur'ƒÅn in Context (Brill, 2010), pp. 135‚Äì148; and Wright, Robert, The Evolution of God, ebook edition, chapter 16 (Little, Brown and Company, 2009) for discussions of this and related accounts. =During the Mongol raids into Syria= In 1267, during the Mongol raids into Syria, an interregnum period between the complete domination of the Levant by the crusader states until 1260 and the conquest of Levant by the Mamluks in 1291, Nachmanides wrote a letter to his son. It contained the following references to the land and the Temple: =Modern rebuilding efforts= Although in mainstream Orthodox Judaism the rebuilding of the Temple is generally left to the coming of the Jewish Messiah and to divine providence, a number of organizations, generally representing a small minority of Orthodox Jews, have been formed with the objective of realizing the immediate construction of a Third Temple in present times. The Temple Institute and the Temple Mount and Eretz Yisrael Faithful Movement each state that its goal is to build the Third Temple on the Temple Mount (Mount Moriah). The Temple Institute has made several items to be used in the Third Temple. =Attempts to re-establish a Jewish presence on the Temple Mount= In August 1967, after the Israeli capture of the Mount, Rabbi Shlomo Goren, the Chief Rabbi of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) (and later chief rabbi of the State of Israel), began organizing public prayer for Jews on the Temple Mount. Rabbi Goren was also well known for his controversial positions concerning Jewish sovereignty over the Temple Mount. On August 15, 1967, shortly after the Six- Day War, Goren led a group of fifty Jews onto the Temple Mount, where, fighting off protesting Muslim guards and Israeli police, they defiantly held a prayer service. Goren continued to pray for many years in the Makhkame building overlooking the Temple Mount where he conducted yearly High Holy Days services. His call for the establishment of a synagogue on the Temple Mount has subsequently been reiterated by his brother-in-law, the Chief Rabbi of Haifa, She'ar Yashuv Cohen. Goren was sharply criticized by the Israeli Defense Ministry, who, noting Goren's senior rank, called his behaviour inappropriate. The episode led the Chief Rabbis of the time to restate the accepted laws of Judaism that no Jews were allowed on the mount due to issues of ritual impurity. The secular authorities welcomed this ruling as it preserved the status quo with the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf. Disagreeing with his colleagues, Goren continually maintained that Jews were not only permitted, but commanded, to ascend and pray on the mount. Goren repeatedly advocated or supported building a Third Temple on the Temple Mount from the 1960s onward, and was associated with various messianic projects involving the site. In the summer of 1983, Goren and several other rabbis joined Rabbi Yehuda Getz, who worked for the Religious Affairs Ministry at the Western Wall, in touring a chamber underneath the mount that Getz had excavated, where the two claimed to have seen the Ark of the Covenant. The tunnel was shortly discovered and resulted in a massive brawl between young Jews and Arabs in the area. The tunnel was quickly sealed with concrete by Israeli police. The sealed entrance can be seen from the Western Wall Tunnel, which opened to the public in 1996. The Chief Rabbis of Israel, Isser Yehuda Unterman and Yitzhak Nissim, together with other leading rabbis, asserted that \\"For generations we have warned against and refrained from entering any part of the Temple Mount.\\" A recent study of this rabbinical ruling suggests that it was both \\"unprecedented\\" and possibly prompted by governmental pressure on the rabbis, and \\"brilliant\\" in preventing Muslim‚ÄìJewish friction on the Mount.Hassner, Ron E., \\"War on Sacred Grounds,\\" Cornell University Press (2009), pp. 113‚Äì133 Rabbinical consensus in the Religious Zionist stream of Orthodox Judaism continues to hold that it is forbidden for Jews to enter any part of the Temple MountThese rabbis include: Mordechai Eliyahu, former Sefardi Chief Rabbi of Israel; Zalman Baruch Melamed, rosh yeshiva of the Beit El yeshiva; Eliezer Waldenberg, former rabbinical judge in the Rabbinical Supreme Court of the State of Israel; Avraham Yitzchak Kook, Chief Rabbi of Palestine (Mikdash-Build (Vol. I, No. 26) ); Avigdor Nebenzahl, Rabbi of the Old City of Jerusalem. and in January 2005 a declaration was signed confirming the 1967 decision.These rabbis include: Rabbis Yona Metzger (Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel); Shlomo Amar (Sefardi Chief Rabbi of Israel); Ovadia Yosef (spiritual leader of Sefardi Haredi Judaism and of the Shas party, and former Sefardi Chief Rabbi of Israel); Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron (former Sefardi Chief Rabbi of Israel); Shmuel Rabinowitz (rabbi of the Western Wall); Avraham Shapiro (former Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel); Shlomo Aviner (rosh yeshiva of Ateret Cohanim); Yisrael Meir Lau (former Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel and current Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv). Source: Leading rabbis rule Temple Mount is off-limits to Jews On the eve of Shavuot in 2014, or 6th Sivan, 5774 in the Hebrew calendar, 400 Jews ascended the Temple Mount; some were photographed in prayer. Obstacles The most immediate and obvious obstacle to realization of these goals is the fact that two historic Islamic structures which are 13 centuries old, namely the Al Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, are built on top of the Temple Mount. Any efforts to damage or reduce access to these sites, or to build Jewish structures within, between, beneath, beside, cantilevered on top of, or instead of them, could lead to severe international conflicts, given the association of the Muslim world with these holy places. The Dome of the Rock is regarded as occupying the actual space where the Second Temple once stood, but some scholars disagree and instead claim that the Temple was located either just north of the Dome of the Rock, or about 200 meters south of it, with access to the Gihon fresh water spring, or perhaps between the Dome of the Rock and the Al Aqsa Mosque.On The Location of the First and Second Temples in Jerusalem, by Lambert Dolphin and Michael Kollen In addition, most Orthodox Jewish scholars reject any attempts to build the Temple before the coming of Messiah. This is because there are many doubts as to the exact location in which it is required to be built. For example, while measurements are given in cubits, there exists a controversy whether this unit of measurement equals approximately . Without exact knowledge of the size of a cubit, the altar could not be built. The Talmud recounts that the building of the Second Temple was only possible under the direct prophetic guidance of Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. Without valid prophetic revelation, it would be impossible to rebuild the Temple, even if the mosques no longer occupied its location. Despite obstacles, efforts are under way by various analytical groups to articulate the benefits to local and regional constituents and participants to encourage developments that would progressively align in support. It is known from the TalmudPsachim 64b that in the time of King Agrippa, Jerusalem was filled with millions of visitors and pilgrims from the entire region. Today the potential of spiritual tourism would support the growth goals of the Mayor of Jerusalem for 10 million tourists annually. This would provide a significant boost to the economy and would benefit people locally and regionally, many of whom live in poverty.https://community.oecd.org/community/factblog/blog/2010/01/20/poverty- in-israel Since the rebuilding of the Temple can come only through a process of peace, it must be preceded by numerous efforts, including the financial and project infrastructures to support such a large increase in tourism, local and regional co-operation agreements to enable its construction and the success of modern attempts to revive the Sanhedrin, the authority which must be empowered for such an event to occur. Status of Temple Mount Many rabbis interpret halakha (Jewish religious law) as prohibiting Jews from entering the Holy of Holies. The situation is complicated as the Dome of the Rock and Al- Aqsa Mosque fall under control of Muslim clerics, but Israeli police administer its security. According to CNN: A 2000 visit to the Temple Mount by Ariel Sharon resulted in a clash between \\"stone-throwing Palestinians and Israeli troops, who fired tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowd,\\" coinciding with the beginning of the Second Intifada (widely interpreted as having ended in 2005). During the Sukkot festival in 2006, National Union Knesset member Uri Ariel visited the Temple Mount without incident and the Israeli police witnessed no provocation by the protestors. Jewish views =Orthodox Judaism= Destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem, by Francesco Hayez Orthodox Judaism believes in the rebuilding of a Third Temple and the resumption of korban (sacrifices), although there is disagreement about how rebuilding should take place. Orthodox scholars and rabbinic authorities generally believe that rebuilding should occur in the era of the Jewish messiah at the hand of divine providence, although a minority position, following the opinion of Maimonides, holds that Jews should endeavour to rebuild the temple themselves, whenever possible. The generally accepted position among Orthodox Jews is that the full order of the sacrifices will be resumed upon the building of the Temple. This belief is embedded in Orthodox Jewish prayer services. Three times a day, Orthodox Jews recite the Amidah, which contains prayers for the Temple's restoration and for the resumption of sacrifices, and every day there is a recitation of the order of the day's sacrifices and the psalms the Levites would have sung that day. Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist authorities disavow all belief in the resumption of korban. Maimonides wrote in The Guide for the Perplexed \\"that God deliberately has moved Jews away from sacrifices towards prayer, as prayer is a higher form of worship\\". However, in his Jewish legal code, the Mishneh Torah, he states that animal sacrifices will resume in the Third Temple, and details how they will be carried out. Some attribute to Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook the view that animal sacrifices will not be reinstituted. These views on the Temple service are sometimes misconstrued (for example, in Olat Raiyah, commenting on the prophecy of Malachi (\\"Then the grain-offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to God as in the days of old and as in former years\\" [Malachi 3:4]), Kook indicates that only grain offerings will be offered in the reinstated Temple service, while in a related essay from Otzarot Hare'ayah (Igrot HaRaiyah?) he suggests otherwise). =Conservative Judaism= Conservative Judaism believes in a messiah and in a rebuilt Temple, but does not believe in the restoration of sacrifices. Accordingly, Conservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards has modified the prayers. Conservative prayerbooks call for the restoration of Temple, but do not ask for resumption of sacrifices. The Orthodox study session on sacrifices in the daily morning service has been replaced with the Talmudic passages teaching that deeds of loving-kindness now atone for sin. In the daily Amidah prayer, the central prayer in Jewish services, the petitions to accept the \\"fire offerings of Israel\\" and \\"the grain-offering of Judah and Jerusalem\\" (Malachi 3:4) are removed. In the special Mussaf Amidah prayer said on Shabbat and Jewish holidays, the Hebrew phrase na'ase ve'nakriv (we will present and sacrifice) is modified to read to asu ve'hikrivu (they presented and sacrificed), implying that sacrifices are a thing of the past. The prayer for the restoration of \\"the House of our lives\\" and the Shekhinah to dwell \\"among us\\" in the weekday Torah reading service is retained in Conservative prayer books, although not all Conservative services say it. In Conservative prayer books, words and phrases that have dual meaning, referring to both Temple features and theological or poetic concepts, are generally retained. Translations and commentaries, however, generally refer to the poetic or theological meanings only. Conservative Judaism also takes an intermediate position on Kohanim and Levites, preserving patrilineal tribal descent and some aspects of their roles, but lifting restrictions on whom Kohanim are permitted to marry. In 2006, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards adapted a series of responsa on the subject of the role, in Conservative Judaism, of Niddah, a description of a woman during menstruation, which was considered in relation to the role of Temple-related concepts of ritual purity within contemporary Judaism. One responsum adopted by a majority of the Committee held that concepts of ritual purity relevant to entry into the Temple are no longer applicable to contemporary Judaism and accepted a proposal to change the term \\"family purity\\" to \\"family holiness\\" and to explain the continuing observance of niddah on a different basis from continuity with Temple practices. Another responsum, also adopted by a majority of the Committee, called for retaining existing observances, terminology, and rationale, and held that these Temple-related observances and concepts continued to have contemporary impact and meaning. Thus, consistent with Conservative Judaism's philosophy of pluralism, both views of the continuing relevance of Temple- related concepts of ritual purity are permissible Conservative views. Theodor Herzl includes the reconstructed Temple in his novel Altneuland, but along with an intact Dome of the Rock. =Reform Judaism= Reform Judaism does not believe in the rebuilding of a central Temple or a restoration of Temple sacrifices or worship. It regards the Temple and sacrificial era as a period of a more primitive form of ritual from which Judaism has evolved and should not return. It also believes a special role for Kohanim and Levites represents a caste system incompatible with modern principles of egalitarianism, and does not preserve these roles. Furthermore, there is a Reform view that the shul or synagogue is a modern Temple; hence, \\"Temple\\" appears in numerous congregation names in Reform Judaism. Indeed, the re-designation of the synagogue as \\"temple\\" was one of the hallmarks of early Reform in 19th-century Germany, when Berlin was declared the new Jerusalem, and Reform Jewry sought to demonstrate their staunch German nationalism. The Anti-Zionism that characterized Reform Judaism throughout much of its history subsided somewhat with the Holocaust in Europe and the later successes of the modern state of Israel. The belief in the return of the Jews to the Temple in Jerusalem is not part of mainstream Reform Judaism. Christian views While there are a number of differing views amongst Christianity with regard to the significance or the requirement of a third temple being built in Jerusalem, according to the writers of the New Testament, the New Covenant (spoken of in Jeremiah 31:31‚Äì34) is marked by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the believer (Ezekiel 36:26‚Äì27) and that therefore every believer's body and every gathering of believers comprise the temple, or that the temple has been superseded. Paul illustrates this concept in his letter to the believers at Corinth: This idea is related to the belief that Christ himself, having claimed to be and do what the temple was and did, is the new temple (), and that his people, as a part of the \\"body of Christ\\" (meaning the church), are part of this temple as well (; ; ). The result, according to N. T. Wright, is that the earthly temple (along with the city of Jerusalem and the Land of Israel) is no longer of any spiritual significance: :[Paul] refers to the church, and indeed to individual Christians, as the 'temple of the living God' (1 Cor. 3:16, 6:19). To Western Christians, thinking anachronistically of the temple as simply the Jewish equivalent of a cathedral, the image is simply one metaphor among many and without much apparent significance. For a first- century Jew, however, the Temple had an enormous significance; as a result, when Paul uses such an image within twenty-five years of the Crucifixion (with the actual temple still standing), it is a striking index of the immense change that has taken place in his [Paul‚Äôs] thought. The Temple had been superseded by the Church. If this is so for the Temple, and in Romans 4 for the Land, then it must a fortiori be the case for Jerusalem, which formed the concentric circle in between those two in the normal Jewish worldview.N. T. Wright, \\"Jerusalem in the New Testament\\" (1994) In the teaching of both Jesus and Paul, then, according to Wright, Ben F. Meyer, also, argued that Jesus applied prophecy regarding Zion and temple to himself and his followers: :[Jesus] affirmed the prophecies of salvation with their end-time imagery Zion and the temple‚Äîbelonging to the eschatological themes that the \\"pilgrimage of the peoples\\" evoked. But contrary to the common expectation of his contemporaries, Jesus expected the destruction of the temple in the coming eschatological ordeal (Mark 13:2=Matt 24:2=Luke 21:6). The combination seems contradictory. How could he simultaneously predict the ruin of the temple in the ordeal and affirm the end-time fulfilment of promise and prophecy on Zion and temple? The paradox is irresolvable until one takes note of another trait of Jesus' words on the imagery of Zion and temple, namely, the consistent application to his own disciples of Zion- and temple-imagery: the city on the mountain (Matt 5:14; cf. Thomas, 32), the cosmic rock (Matt 16:18; cf. John 1:42), the new sanctuary (Mark 14:58; Matt 26:61). The mass of promise and prophecy will come to fulfilment in this eschatological and messianic circle of believers.Ben F. Meyer, \\"The Temple at the Navel of the Earth,\\" in Christus Faber: the master builder and the house of God, Princeton Theological Monograph Series no. 29 (Allison Park, Pa.: Pickwick Publications, 1992) 217, 261. Some would therefore see the need for a third temple as being diminished, redundant, or entirely foreclosed and superseded, while others take a position that the building of the third temple is an integral part of Christian eschatology. The various perspectives on the significance of the building of a third temple within Christianity are therefore generally linked to a number of factors including: the level of literal or spiritual interpretation applied to what is taken to be \\"end-time\\" prophecy; the perceived relationships between various scriptures such as Daniel, the Olivet discourse, 2 Thessalonians and Ezekiel (amongst others); whether or not a dual-covenant is considered to be in place; and whether Old Testament promises of the restoration of Israel remain unfulfilled or have all come true in the Messiah (2 Corinthians 1:20). Such factors determine, for example, whether Daniel or 2 Thessalonians are read as referring to a still-future physically restored third temple. A number of these perspectives are illustrated below. =Christian mainstream= The dominant view within Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Protestant Christianity is that animal sacrifices within the Temple were a foreshadowing of the sacrifice Jesus made for the sins of the world through his crucifixion and shedding of his blood on the first day of Passover.Assuming Nisan 15, see Chronology of Jesus#Scholarly debate on the hour, day, and year of death for details. The Epistle to the Hebrews is often cited in support of this view: the temple sacrifices are described as being imperfect, since they require repeating (ch. 10:1‚Äì4), and as belonging to a covenant that was \\"becoming obsolete and growing old\\" and was \\"ready to vanish away\\" (ch. 8:13, ESV). See also Abrogation of Old Covenant laws. Christ's crucifixion, being a sacrifice which dealt with sin once and for all, negated any need for further animal sacrifice. Christ himself is compared to the High Priest who was always standing and performing rituals and sacrifices. Christ, however, having performed his sacrifice, \\"sat down\\" ‚Äî perfection having been finally attained (ch. 10:11‚Äì14,18). Further, the veil or curtain to the Holy of Holies is seen as having been torn asunder at the crucifixion ‚Äì figuratively in connection with this theology (Ch 10:19‚Äì21), and literally according to the Gospel of Matthew (ch 27:50‚Äì51). For these reasons, a third temple, whose partial purpose would be the re-institution of animal sacrifices, is seen as unnecessary and thus superseded. Irenaeus and HippolytusHippolytus, Treatise on Christ and Antichrist, Pt.2. Sn.6. s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Extant Works and Fragments of Hippolytus/Dogmatical and Historical/Treatise on Christ and Antichrist were among early church writers who foresaw a rebuilding of the Temple, as necessary for the preparation for the reign of the Antichrist. Additionally, Jesus himself stated, in response to a Samaritan asking whether it is right to worship on Mount Gerizim or Mount Zion, that \\"a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem... But in spirit and in truth\\". He stated of the Herodian temple, \\"Not one stone will be left on another; every one of them will be thrown down\\" ‚Äì John 4:21, Luke 21:6. Protestant =Dispensationalist= A. C. Gaebelein242x242px Those Protestants who do believe in the importance of a future rebuilt temple (viz., some dispensationalists) hold that the importance of the sacrificial system shifts to a Memorial of the Cross, given the text of Ezekiel Chapters 39 and following (in addition to Millennial references to the Temple in other Old Testament passages); since Ezekiel explains at length the construction and nature of the Millennial temple, in which Jews will once again hold the priesthood; some others hold that perhaps it was not completely eliminated with Jesus' sacrifice for sin, but is a ceremonial object lesson for confession and forgiveness (somewhat like water baptism and Communion are today); and that such animal sacrifices would still be appropriate for ritual cleansing and for acts of celebration and thanksgiving toward God. Some dispensationalists believe this will be the case with the Second Coming when Jesus reigns over earth from the city of New Jerusalem. Some interpret a passage in the Book of Daniel, Daniel 12:11, as a prophecy that the end of this age will occur shortly after sacrifices are ended in the newly rebuilt temple. In 1762, Charles Wesley wrote: =Dispensational Evangelical= Many Evangelical Christians believe that New Testament prophecies associated with the Jewish Temple, such as Matthew 24‚Äì25 and 2 Thessalonians 2:1‚Äì12, were not completely fulfilled during the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 (a belief of full preterism) and that these prophecies refer to a future temple. This view is a core part of dispensationalism, an interpretative framework of the Bible that stresses biblical literalism and asserts that the Jews remain God's chosen people. According to dispensationalist theologians, such as Hal Lindsey and Tim LaHaye, the Third Temple will be rebuilt when the Antichrist, often identified as the political leader of a trans-national alliance similar to the European Union or the United Nations, secures a peace treaty between the modern nation of Israel and its neighbours following a global war. The Antichrist later uses the temple as a venue for proclaiming himself as God and the long-awaited Messiah, demanding worship from humanity. Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Catholic and Orthodox Christians believe that the Eucharist, which they hold to be one in substance with the one self-sacrifice of Christ on the Cross, is a far superior offering when compared with the merely preparatory temple sacrifices, as explained in the Epistle to the Hebrews. They also believe that Christ Himself is the New Temple, as spoken of in the Book of Revelation and that Revelation can best be understood as the Eucharist, heaven on earth. Their church buildings are meant to model Solomon's Temple, with the Tabernacle, containing the Eucharist, being considered the new \\"Holy of Holies.\\" Therefore, they do not attach any significance to a possible future rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple. The Orthodox also quote Daniel 9:27 (\\"... he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease ...\\") to show that the sacrifices would stop with the arrival of the Messiah, and mention that according to Jesus, St. Paul and the Holy Fathers, the temple will only be rebuilt in the times of the Antichrist. Quotations: Matthew 24:15 \\"When you see the desolating abomination spoken of through Daniel the prophet standing in the holy place (let the reader understand)....\\" 2 Thessalonians 2:3‚Äì4 \\"Let no one deceive you in any way. For unless the apostasy comes first and the lawless one is revealed,* the one doomed to perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god and object of worship, so as to seat himself in the temple of God,* claiming that he is a god ‚Äî do you not recall that while I was still with you I told you these things?\\" =Latter Day Saints= Latter Day Saints believe that the Jews will build the Third Temple and after the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, the Jews will accept Jesus as the Messiah and most Jews will then embrace the fullness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Then, it is believed, the Third Temple will be God's temple as Christ reigns on the earth and it will become the Jerusalem LDS Temple. There will be many LDS Temples but two main temples will jointly serve as the central governing places ‚Äì the Jerusalem Temple will function as the resurrected Jesus Christ's Eastern Hemisphere governing place and the New Jerusalem Temple in Independence, Missouri will function as the resurrected Jesus Christ's Western Hemisphere governing place. Both of these two temples will have thrones for Jesus Christ to sit on during his millennial reign. The Community of Christ, the second largest denomination of the Latter Day Saint movement, has operated a temple, open to the public, in Independence, Missouri, since 1994. Another denomination of the LDS movement, the Church of Christ (Temple Lot), possess the Temple Lot, the actual spot on which the Temple will be built. Muslim view Most Muslims view the movement for the building of a Third Temple on the Temple Mount as an affront to Islam due to the presence of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock in the stead of the former Holy Temple. Today the area is regarded by the majority of Muslims as the third holiest site in Islam. Muslims are resolute in calling for recognition of their exclusive rights over the site and demand that it be wholly transferred to Muslim sovereignty; furthermore, some Muslims deny any association with the Mount to the former Jewish Temples which stood at the site. Sheikh Salah: Western Wall belongs to Muslims, February 18, 2007 The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation was initiated in reaction to Denis Michael Rohan, an Australian Christian who set fire to a 12th-century pulpit of the Al-Aqsa mosque, in an attempt to initiate the second coming of Christ. The protection of the Al-Aqsa Mosque is in the primary mandate of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Bah√° º√≠ view In the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, the prophecy of the Third Temple was fulfilled with the writing of the S√∫riy-i-Haykal by Bah√°'u'll√°h in pentacle form. The S√∫riy-i-Haykal or Tablet of the Temple, is a composite work which consists of a tablet followed by five messages addressed to world leaders; shortly after its completion, Bah√°'u'll√°h instructed the tablet be written in the form of a pentacle, symbolizing the human temple and added to it the conclusion: Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in the first half of the 20th century, explained that this verse refers to the prophecy in the Hebrew Bible where Zechariah had promised the rebuilding of the Temple in the End Times as fulfilled in the return of the Manifestation of God, Bah√°'u'll√°h, in a human temple. Throughout the tablet, Bah√°'u'll√°h addresses the Temple (himself) and explains the glory which is invested in it allowing all the nations of the world to find redemption. In the tablet, Bah√°'u'll√°h states that the Manifestation of God is a pure mirror that reflects the sovereignty of God and manifests God's beauty and grandeur to mankind. In essence, Bah√°'u'll√°h explains that the Manifestation of God is a \\"Living Temple\\" and Bah√°'u'll√°h addresses the organs and limbs of the human body and bids each to focus on God and not the earthly world.

In mathematics, in the branch of combinatorics, a graded poset is a partially ordered set (poset) P equipped with a rank function œÅ from P to the set N of all natural numbers. œÅ must satisfy the following two properties: * The rank function is compatible with the ordering, meaning that for every x and y in the order with x < y, it must be the case that œÅ(x) < œÅ(y), and * The rank is consistent with the covering relation of the ordering, meaning that for every x and y for which y covers x, it must be the case that œÅ(y) = œÅ(x) + 1\\\\. The value of the rank function for an element of the poset is called its rank. Sometimes a graded poset is called a ranked poset but that phrase has other meanings; see Ranked poset. A rank or rank level of a graded poset is the subset of all the elements of the poset that have a given rank value... Graded posets play an important role in combinatorics and can be visualized by means of a Hasse diagram.  Examples  Some examples of graded posets (with the rank function in parentheses) are: * the natural numbers N, with their usual order (rank: the number itself), or some interval [0, N] of this poset, * Nn, with the product order (sum of the components), or a subposet of it that is a product of intervals, * the positive integers, ordered by divisibility (number of prime factors, counted with multiplicity), or a subposet of it formed by the divisors of a fixed N, * the Boolean lattice of finite subsets of a set (number of elements of the subset), * the lattice of partitions of a set into finitely many parts, ordered by reverse refinement (number of parts), * the lattice of partitions of a finite set X, ordered by refinement (number of elements of X minus number of parts), * a group and a generating set, or equivalently its Cayley graph, ordered by the weak or strong Bruhat order, and ranked by word length (length of shortest reduced word). ** In particular for Coxeter groups, for example permutations of a totally ordered n-element set, with either the weak or strong Bruhat order (number of adjacent inversions), * geometric lattices, such as the lattice of subspaces of a vector space (dimension of the subspace), * the distributive lattice of finite lower sets of another poset (number of elements), * Young's lattice, a particular instance of the previous example (number of boxes in the Young diagram), * face lattices of convex polytopes (dimension of the face, plus one), * abstract polytopes (\\"distance\\" from the least face, minus one ), * abstract simplicial complexes (number of elements of the simplex).  Alternative characterizations  N5 can't be graded. A bounded posetMeaning it has a least element and greatest element. admits a grading if and only if all maximal chains in P have the same length:I.e., one does not have a situation like x < z_1 < y and x < w_1 < w_2 < y both being maximal chains. setting the rank of the least element to 0 then determines the rank function completely. This covers many finite cases of interest; see picture for a negative example. However, unbounded posets can be more complicated. A candidate rank function, compatible with the ordering, makes a poset into graded poset if and only if, whenever one has x < z with z of rank n+1, an element y of rank n can be found with x ‚â§ y < z. This condition is sufficient because if z is taken to be a cover of x, the only possible choice is y = x showing that the ranks of x and z differ by 1, and it is necessary because in a graded poset one can take for y any element of maximal rank with x ‚â§ y < z, which always exists and is covered by z. Often a poset comes with a natural candidate for a rank function; for instance if its elements are finite subsets of some base set B, one can take the number of elements of those subsets. Then the criterion just given can be more practical than the definition because it avoids mention of covers. For instance if B is itself a poset, and P consists of its finite lower sets (subsets for which with every one of its elements, all smaller elements are also in the subset), then the criterion is automatically satisfied, since for lower sets x ‚äÜ z there is always a maximal element of z that is absent from x, and it can be removed from z to form y. :In some common posets such as the face lattice of a convex polytope there is a natural grading by dimension, which if used as rank function would give the minimal element, the empty face, rank ‚Äì1. In such cases it might be convenient to bend the definition stated above by adjoining the value ‚Äì1 to the set of values allowed for the rank function. Allowing arbitrary integers as rank would however give a fundamentally different notion; for instance the existence of a minimal element would no longer be assured. A graded poset (with positive integer ranks) cannot have any elements x for which arbitrarily long chains with greatest element x exist, as otherwise it would have to have elements of arbitrarily small (and eventually negative) rank. For instance, the integers (with the usual order) cannot be a graded poset, nor can any interval (with more than one element) of rational or real numbers. (In particular, graded posets are well-founded, meaning that they satisfy the descending chain condition (DCC): they do not contain any infinite descending chains.Not containing arbitrarily long descending chains starting at a fixed element of course excludes any infinite descending chains. The former condition is strictly stronger though; the set \\\\N\\\\cup{\\\\infty} has arbitrarily long chains descending from \\\\infty, but has no infinite descending chains.) Henceforth we shall therefore only consider posets in which this does not happen. This implies that whenever x < y we can get from x to y by repeatedly choosing a cover, finitely many times. It also means that (for positive integer rank functions) compatibility of œÅ with the ordering follows from the requirement about covers. As a variant of the definition of a graded poset, Birkhoff'Lattice Theory', Am. Math. Soc., Colloquium Publications, Vol.25, 1967, p.5 allows rank functions to have arbitrary (rather than only nonnegative) integer values. In this variant, the integers can be graded (by the identity function) in his setting, and the compatibility of ranks with the ordering is not redundant. As a third variant, Brightwell and WestSee reference [2], p.722. define a rank function to be integer-valued, but don't require its compatibility with the ordering; hence this variant can grade even e.g. the real numbers by any function, as the requirement about covers is vacuous for this example. Note that graded posets need not satisfy the ascending chain condition (ACC): for instance, the natural numbers contain the infinite ascending chain 0 < 1 < 2 < \\\\cdots. A poset is graded if and only if every connected component of its comparability graph is graded, so further characterizations will suppose this comparability graph to be connected. On each connected component the rank function is only unique up to a uniform shift (so the rank function can always be chosen so that the elements of minimal rank in their connected component have rank 0). If P has a least element √î then being graded is equivalent to the condition that for any element x all maximal chains in the interval [√î, x] have the same length. This condition is necessary since every step in a maximal chain is a covering relation, which should change the rank by 1\\\\. The condition is also sufficient, since when it holds, one can use the mentioned length to define the rank of x (the length of a finite chain is its number of \\"steps\\", so one less than its number of elements), and whenever x covers y, adjoining x to a maximal chain in [√î,y] gives a maximal chain in [√î,x]. If P also has a greatest element √é (so that it is a bounded poset), then the previous condition can be simplified to the requirement that all maximal chains in P have the same (finite) length. This suffices, since any pair of maximal chains in [√î,x] can be extended by a maximal chain in [x,√é] to give a pair of maximal chains in P. :Note Stanley defines a poset to be graded of length n if all its maximal chains have length n (Stanley 1997, p.99). This definition is given in a context where interest is mostly in finite posets, and although the book subsequently often drops the part \\"of length n\\", it does not seem appropriate to use this as definition of \\"graded\\" for general posets, because (1) it says nothing about posets whose maximal chains are infinite, in particular (2) it excludes important posets like Young's lattice. Also it is not clear why in a graded poset all minimal elements, as well as all maximal elements, should be required to have the same length, even if Stanley gives examples making clear that he does mean to require that (ibid, pp.216 and 219).  The usual case  Many authors in combinatorics define graded posets in such a way that all minimal elements of P must have rank 0, and moreover that there is a maximal rank r that is the rank of any maximal element. Then being graded means that all maximal chains have length r, as is indicated above. In this case one says that P has rank r. Furthermore, in this case, to the rank levels are associated the rank numbers or Whitney numbers W_0,W_1,W_2,... . These numbers are defined by W_i = number of elements of P having rank i . The Whitney numbers are connected with a lot of important combinatorial theorems. The classic example is Sperner's theorem, which can be formulated as follows: :For the powerset \\\\mathcal P(S) of every finite set S the maximum cardinality of a Sperner family equals the maximum Whitney number. This means: :Every finite powerset has the Sperner property  See also  * Graded (mathematics) * Prewellordering ‚Äì a prewellordering with a norm is analogous to a graded poset, replacing a map to the integers with a map to the ordinals * Star product, a method for combining two graded posets  Notes   References   * Category:Algebraic combinatorics Category:Order theory ","title":"Graded poset"},{"id":"2514972","title":"M√°gico Gonz√°lez"},{"id":"2514981","text":"Hans Hartung (21 September 1904 - 7 December 1989) was a German-French painter, known for his gestural abstract style. He was also a decorated World War II veteran of the French Foreign Legion. Life Hartung was born in Leipzig, Germany into an artistic family. He developed an early appreciation of Rembrandt, German painters such as Lovis Corinth, and the Expressionists Oskar Kokoschka and Emil Nolde. In 1924 he enrolled in Leipzig University, where he studied philosophy and art history.Alley, Ronald, \\"Hans Hartung\\", Oxford Art Online He subsequently studied at the Fine Arts academy of Dresden, where he copied the paintings of the masters. The modern French and Spanish works he saw in 1926 at the Internationale Kunstausstellung in Dresden were a revelation to him, and he decided that he would leave his native country to prevent succumbing to provincialism. Consequently, after a bicycle trip through Italy, he moved to Paris. In Paris, Hartung had little contact with other artists, and copied the works of old and modern masters. He visited the south of France, where the landscape inspired him to a close study of the works of C√©zanne, and he developed a great interest in principles of harmony and proportion such as the golden section. In 1928 he visited Munich where he studied painting technique with Max Doerner. In 1929 he married the artist Anna-Eva Bergman and established himself in the French towns of Leucate, and then in the Spanish Balearic Islands, eventually settling in Menorca. He exhibited for the first time in 1931 in Dresden. Hans Hartung, 1955. Photo by Paolo Monti, 1955 (Fondo Paolo Monti, BEIC) The death of his father in 1932 severed Hartung's last bonds with Germany. He was rejected from Nazi Germany on account of being a 'degenerate', because his painting style was associated with Cubism ‚Äì an art movement incompatible with Nazi Germany's ideals. In 1935 when he attempted to sell paintings while visiting Berlin, the police tried to arrest him. He was able to flee the country with the help of his friend Christian Zervos. After he returned to Paris as a refugee, Hartung and his wife divorced, and he became depressed. His paintings were becoming more abstract and did not sell well. His friends tried to help him with his financial difficulties, and the sculptor Julio Gonz√°lez offered him the use of his studio. In 1939 Hartung married Gonz√°lez's daughter Roberta. In December 1939, he became a member of the French Foreign Legion. He was closely followed by the Gestapo and arrested for seven months by the French police. After they learned he was a painter, he was put in a red cell in an attempt to disturb his vision. After being released he rejoined the Legion to fight in North Africa, losing a leg in a battle near Belfort. He earned French citizenship in 1945, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre. In 1947 in Paris he had his first solo exhibition. By the late 1950s he had achieved recognition for his gestural paintings, which were nearly monochromatic and characterized by configurations of long rhythmical brushstrokes or scratches. In 1960 he was awarded the International Grand Prix for painting at the Venice Biennale..accessed on line June 15, 2007 Hartung's freewheeling abstract paintings set influential precedents for many younger American painters of the sixties, making him an important forerunner of American Lyrical Abstraction of the 1960s and 1970s. He was featured in the 1963 film documentary School of Paris: (5 Artists at Work) by American filmmaker Warren Forma. In 1957, Hartung and Anna-Eva Bergman remarried.

Origin Stuffo first appears in a few late medieval/early modern Bonifacian legends. A 1756 image of the god being overthrown by the saint is found in the village of K√ºllstedt. The legend was taken up by German Romanticism in the 18th and 19th centuries, which saw in Stuffo even a legendary origin for noble families like the Stauffenbergs. Such etymologies and myths of origin are no longer accepted.L√∂ffler 3-4. Locations and backstory Two mountain-top locations have been proposed as sites of worship for Stuffo: the Staufenberg near Gie√üen, in Hesse; and the Stuffenberg, now H√ºlfensberg, in the Eichsfeld district, Thuringia. At any rate, there are over half a dozen mountains of a similar name in Hesse alone (stouf meaning something like \\"sharp mountain peak\\").Lyncker vi. The source for the latter designation comes from the 1602 Historia S. Bonifacii by Johannes Letzner, who claims that after Boniface destroyed the Donar Oak near Geismar (now in Fritzlar, Hesse) he traveled to the Stuffenberg in Eichsfeld, where the god Stuffo was worshiped by the local population. Boniface fought and defeated the god, who fell into a hole, still called \\"Stuffo's hole,\\"L√∂ffler 4. a story retold by Johann Nepomuk Seppin Die Religion der alten Deutschen (1890).Sepp 24. Afterward, Boniface turned the pagan place of worship into a church in which he placed a priest to teach Christianity to the locals.L√∂ffler 4. Later versions expand on the account, conflating it with popular myth about Charlemagne; Erfurt bishop Nikolaus Elgard wrote in 1575 that \\"der heilige Bonifatius dort ein G√∂tzenbild, durch das ein D√§mon redete mit Namen Stauff, zerst√∂rt und bei dem Berge ein Heer der Ungl√§ubigen geschlagen habe. Darum nannte er den Berg H√ºlfensberg (Inde salvatus salvatoris montem vocavit)\\" (\\"there, Saint Boniface destroyed an image of a god through which a demon called Stauff spoke, and at the mountain he defeated an army of unbelievers, which is why he named the mountain H√ºlfensberg\\").Gropper 293; transl. in L√∂fler 4-5. A nineteenth-century Eichsfeld historian, Dr. Konrad Zehrt, combines the Donar Oak and the Stuffo accounts, and locates them both on the H√ºlfensberg.L√∂ffler 3, 5. Etymology Various etymologies were offered for the name, including derivation from the Middle High German word s√ªfen (\\"drinking to excess\\"),Wright 44; Shay 297. which led to Stuffo being associated with drunkenness.L√∂ffler 3. Graf's Gardenstone, which accepts Stuffo's existence, lists Becher (\\"drinking cup\\") as a possible etymology.Graf 228-29. However, as early as 1802, Eichsfeld historian Johann Vinzenz Wolf had stated that \\"seine Gottheit hat Stuffo der falschen Deutung des Wortes Stuffenberg zu verdanken\\" (\\"Stuffo owes his divinity to a false interpretation of the name Stuffenberg\\").Wolf; qtd. in L√∂ffler 7.

Outdoor education programs sometimes involve residential or journey wilderness-based experiences in which students participate in a variety of adventurous challenges and outdoor activities such as hiking, climbing, canoeing, ropes courses and group games. Outdoor education draws upon the philosophy, theory, and practices of experiential education and environmental education. A group of Outward Bound participants with physical disabilities after completing a ropes course, c. 1996. Scope Outdoor education has diverse goals and practices, but always involves learning about, in, and through the outdoors. =Definitions= Outdoor education can be simply defined as experiential learning in, for, or about the outdoors. The term 'outdoor education', however, is used broadly to refer to a range of organized activities that take place in a variety of ways in predominantly outdoor environments. Common definitions of outdoor education are difficult to achieve because interpretations vary according to culture, philosophy, and local conditions.Outdoor recreation. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.trunity.net/lifegermination/topics/view/23121/ Outdoor education is often referred to as synonymous with outdoor learning, outdoor school, forest schools and wilderness education. Outdoor education often uses or draws upon related elements and/or informs related areas. The hallmark of outdoor education is its focus on the \\"outdoor\\" side of this education; whereas adventure education would focus on the adventure side and environmental education would focus on environmental. Expeditionary education involves expeditions into wilderness \\"where man is but a visitor.\\" All of these activities typically involve experiential education. =Education outside the classroom= \\"Education outside the classroom\\" describes school curriculum learning, other than with a class of students sitting in a room with a teacher and books. It encompasses biology field trips and searching for insects in the school garden, as well as indoor activities like observing stock control in a local shop, or visiting a museum. It is a concept currently enjoying a revival because of the recognition of benefits from the more active style. The Education and Skills CommitteeEducation and Skills Committee, House of Commons of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom has reported that it brings history and art to life, develops social skills, and clearly enhances geography and science.,. There are key policies in place for outdoor learning in England, Scotland and Wales. Despite the evidence supporting an extension of outdoor learning for children, there are a number of obstacles in the way. One of these obstacles is risk aversion amongst teachers, parents and others, raising reluctance to such diverse and physical tasks. The journalist Tim Gill has written about parental and institutional risk aversion affecting many activities with children in his book \\"No Fear\\". Another obstacle is the perceived high cost of facilitating outdoor learning. Creating an outdoor learning environment needn't cost a great deal, however. The UK Early Years Framework Stage, which outlines best practice in Early Years teaching, asserts that: \\"Outdoor learning is more effective when adults focus on what children need to be able to do rather than what children need to have. An approach that considers experiences rather than equipment places children at the centre of learning and ensures that individual children's learning and developmental needs are taken account of and met effectively\\"Early Years Framework Stage 'Effective Practice: Outdoor Learning\\", 2007 Linda Tallent, a UK-based educational consultant who has worked extensively with schools to develop their outdoor spaces into learning environments, agrees. She believes that by focussing on activities and skill development, it is possible to develop an outdoor learning curriculum on a 'shoe string'.Linda Tallent, 'Outdoor Learning', 2007 She cites a comment by Will Nixon, who reminds readers that 'Using the real world is the way learning has happened for 99.9% of human existence. Only in the last hundred years have we put it into a little box called a classroom.'.Will Nixon, 'Letting Nature Shape Childhood', The Amicus Journal, Fall 1997, in Linda Tallent 'Outdoor Learning' 2007 Tallent also refers to evidence from a number of studies that the most effective way of learning is through participation, and calls on educators to make a special effort to create opportunities for children to participate in their learning. =Aims= Some typical aims of outdoor education are to: * learn how to overcome adversity * enhance personal and social development * develop a deeper relationship with nature. * raise attainment through better teaching and learning experiences Outdoor education spans the three domains of self, others, and the natural world. The relative emphasis of these three domains varies from one program to another. An outdoor education program can, for example, emphasize one (or more) of these aims to: * teach outdoor survival skills * improve problem solving skills * reduce recidivism * enhance teamwork * develop leadership skills * understand natural environments * promote spirituality * provide an active, first-hand learning experience Outdoor education is often used as a means to create a deeper sense of place for people in a community. Sense of place is manifested through the understanding and connection that one has with the area in which they reside. Sense of place is an important aspect of environmentalism as well as environmental justice because it makes the importance of sustaining a particular ecosystem that much more personal to an individual. History Field trip: school children outdoors listening to man, c. 1899, US Modern outdoor education owes its beginnings to separate initiatives. Organized camping was evident in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century in Europe, the UK, the US, Australia, and New Zealand. The Scouting movement, established in the UK in 1907 by Robert Baden-Powell, employs non-formal education with an emphasis on practical outdoor activities. The first Outward Bound centre at Aberdyfi in Wales was established during the Second World War. The Forest schools of Denmark are examples of European programs with similar aims and objectives. Key outdoor education pioneers include Kurt Hahn, a German educator who founded schools such as the Schule Schloss Salem in Germany; the United World Colleges movement, the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme (which emphasizes community service, craftsmanship skills, physical skill, and outdoor expeditions), and the Outward Bound movement. The second half of the twentieth century saw rapid growth of outdoor education in all sectors (state, voluntary, and commercial) with an ever-widening range of client groups and applications. In this period Outward Bound spread to over 40 countries, including the US in the 1960s. Other US based outdoor education programs include Project Adventure and the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS). Project Adventure focuses on day use of ropes courses. NOLS uses the outdoor setting to train leaders for outdoor programs and for other settings including training every new US astronaut and 10% of the US Naval Academy. The Association for Experiential Education is a professional association for \\"experiential\\" educators. The Wilderness Education Association (WEA) is a consortium of college outdoor education programs with a standard curriculum based on an academic model. (See also North America in the Around the World section.) A history of outdoor education in the UK has been documented by Lyn Cook (1999),Cook L. (1999). The 1944 Education Act and outdoor education: from policy to practice. History of Education, 28 (2), 157-172. and a history of outdoor education in New Zealand has been published in Pip Lynch's Camping in the Curriculum (2007).Lynch, P. (?). Camping in the Curriculum: A History of Outdoor Education in New Zealand Schools. PML publications, Lincoln University, Canterbury, New Zealand. Philosophy and theory Philosophy and theory about outdoor education tends to emphasise the effect of natural environments on human beings, the educative role of stress and challenge, and experiential learning. One view is that participants are at their \\"rawest\\" level when outdoors because they are \\"stripped\\" of many of the conveniences of modern life. Participants can become more aware that they are part of a greater ecosystem and are not as bound by social customs and norms. In essence participants can be true to themselves and more able to see others as people regardless of race, class, religion etc. Outdoor education also helps instill the basic elements of teamwork because participants often need to work together and rely on others. For many people a high ropes course or an outdoor activity may stretch their comfort zone and cause them to challenge themselves physically which in turn can lead to challenging oneself mentally.

Foundational work on the philosophy of outdoor education includes work by: * Kurt Hahn * Willi Unsoeld A wide range of social science and specific outdoor education theories and models have been applied in an effort to better understand outdoor education. Amongst the key theoretical models or concepts are: * Experiential education theories * Group development theories * the Outward Bound Process Model * Stress, optimal arousal, comfort zone, and psychological flow theories * Psychoevolutionary theory and the Biophilia hypothesis Around the world Outdoor education occurs, in one form or another, in most if not all countries of the world. However, it can be implemented very differently, depending on the cultural context. Some countries, for example, view outdoor education as synonymous with environmental education, whilst other countries treat outdoor education and environmental education as distinct. Modern forms of outdoor education are most prevalent in the UK, US, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and to some extent Asia and Africa. Many outdoor Education programs were cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The UK: The English Outdoor Council, an umbrella body, defines outdoor education as a way for students and teachers to be fully engaged in a lesson, all the while embracing the outdoors. The EOC deems outdoor education as \\"providing depth to the curriculum and makes an important contribution to students' physical, personal and social education.\\". In the UK, Learning through Landscapes champion the use of School Grounds as a cost effective, easily accessible place of learning and play. Forest School. is also fashionable in the UK, providing a very specialist approach to personal development within the wider context of Outdoor Learning. Australia & New Zealand: Australia & New Zealand are home to several outdoor education certificate programs. Once teachers have completed their schooling, many have opportunities to work at various outdoor education centres in either country. The Australian outdoor council has developed curriculum documents to ensure schools are partaking in outdoor education throughout the country. Canada: Environmental education, most notably outdoor education in Canada is seen through outdoor camp and residential programs, school-based programs and commercial travel operations. Outdoor education in Canada is based around \\"hard\\" technical skills‚Äîoften travel and camping skills‚Äîand the \\"soft\\"‚Äîgroup skills and personal growth qualities‚Äîare blended with, one might say, the \\"green\\" and \\"warm\\" skills of a complementary eco-adventure focus.\\"Henderson, B., & Potter, G. T. (n.d.). Outdoor AdventureEducation in Canada: Seeking The Country Way Back In. 227-242. Adventures are found whether one is partaking in environmental awareness or team-building workshops throughout Canada. Many schools and after-school programs such as The YMCA camps lean towards outdoor education, especially during the summer months. Denmark: Denmark is known as one of the more environmentally conscious countries in the developed world. One of the ways in which this presents itself, is through the forest school system that exists there. Children are taught in the woods using nature and animals to learn about basic environmental education as well as the fundamental elementary education that is required. Finland: At Finnish schools, the term ‚Äúoutdoor education‚Äù represents teaching and learning that takes place outside the classroom with the aim to achieve goals in the National core curriculum for basic education as and in the National core curriculum for upper secondary schools. In the upper secondary schools (students aged 16‚Äì18), the theme is ‚ÄúSustainable development‚Äù. Students are encouraged to pursue a sustainable lifestyle, to take action for sustainable development, and to examine the challenges of SD. Some vocational institutes offer secondary lever degree in Nature and Environmental Studies focusing mainly to tourism and experience industries. Humak University of Applied Sciences offers a bachelor's degree in Adventure and Outdoor Education in its English language programme focusing on the technical skills for the adventure sports and pedagogy, tourism and entrepreneurship. Annually 20 students are taken in to the programme. In addition Humak University of Applied Sciences offers updating education for teachers and persons active in adventure sports in their Open University of Applied Sciences. France: Alain Kerjean founded in 1986 \\"Hors Limites-Outward Bound France\\", adaptation to adults of active pedagogy and introduces in France apprentissage par l'exp√©rience movement. The first Latin country member of this network. Honnor president : SAS Prince Albert of Monaco. In 1994 was founded two bodies : Association Apprendre par l'exp√©rience (youth), and SARL Exp√©rientiel (corporate). From 2008, Alain Kerjean develops Outdoor Education for universities in Romania and advises in France training organizations wishing to design programs based on this pedagogy. His books and articles make available Anglo-Saxon research and publications on the subject to the French public. Research and critical views There is much anecdotal evidence about benefits of outdoor education experiences; teachers, for example, often speak of the improvement they have in relationships with students following a trip. However, hard evidence showing that outdoor education has a demonstrable long-term effect on behaviour or educational achievement is harder to identify; this may be in part because of the difficulty involved in conducting studies which separate out the effects of outdoor education on meaningful outcomes. A major meta- analysis of 97 empirical studies indicated a positive overall effect of adventure education programs on outcomes such as self-concept, leadership, and communication skills.Hattie, J. A., Marsh, H. W., Neill, J. T. & Richards, G. E. (1997). Adventure education and Outward Bound: Out-of-class experiences that have a lasting effect. Review of Educational Research, 67, 43-87. This study also indicated that there appeared to be ongoing positive effects. The largest empirical study of the effects of outdoor education programs (mostly Outward Bound programs) found small-moderate short-term positive impacts on a diverse range of generic life skills, with the strongest outcomes for longer, expedition-based programs with motivated young adults, and partial long-term retention of these gains.Neill, J. T. (2008). Enhancing personal effectiveness: Impacts of outdoor education programs. PhD thesis. Sydney: University of Western Sydney. In \\"Adventure in a Bun\\", Chris Loynes has suggested that outdoor education is increasingly an entertainment park consumption experience. In a paper entitled \\"The Generative Paradigm\\", Loynes has also called for an increase in \\"creativity, spontaneity and vitality\\". These dialogues indicate a need for those working in outdoor education to examine assumptions to ensure that their work is educational (Hovelynck & Peeters, 2003). Outdoor education has been found more beneficial to those students who find classroom learning more challenging. Maynard, Waters & Clement (2013) found that, resonating with their previous findings, the teachers in their study reported \\"that when engaged in child-initiated activity in the outdoor environment, over half of the children who in the classroom were perceived to be 'underachieving' appeared to behave differently\\" (p. 221). Their work aims to support the notion that the more natural outdoor spaces in which child-initiated activities take place both directly and indirectly diminish the perception of underachievement. This is important because a number of studies have shown that expectations based on perception of students is important for student learning. This may also be due to a non-academic family background, or a personal psychological trait such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. When German children from forest kindergartens went to primary school, teachers observed a significant improvement in reading, writing, mathematics, social interactions and many other areas.Gorges R. Waldkindergartenkinder Im Ersten Schuljahr (in German) A yearlong study was done where a group of 9th and 12th grade students learned through outdoor education. The focus was on raising the critical thinking skills of the students as a measure of improvement, where critical thinking was defined to be, \\"the process of purposeful self-regulatory judgment and decision making\\". The problem solving capabilities included the ability of students to interpret, to analyze, to evaluate, to infer, to explain and to self-regulate. Researchers found that both 9th and 12th graders scored higher than the control groups in critical thinking by a significant amount. Using the Environment as an Integrating Context for learning (EIC) is the foundation of a substantial report which found benefits in learning outside the classroom on standardized measures of academic achievement in reading, writing, math, science, and social studies; reduced discipline problems; and increased enthusiasm for learning and pride in accomplishments.

A container in gardening is a small, enclosed and usually portable object used for displaying live flowers or plants. It may take the form of a pot, box, tub, basket, tin, barrel or hanging basket.  Methods  Pots, traditionally made of terracotta but now more commonly plastic, and window boxes have been the most commonly seen. Small pots are commonly called flowerpots. In some cases, this method of growing is used for ornamental purposes. This method is also useful in areas where the soil or climate is unsuitable for the plant or crop in question. Using a container is also generally necessary for houseplants. Limited growing space, or growing space that is paved over, can also make this option appealing to the gardener. Additionally, this method is popular for urban horticulture on balconies of apartments and condominiums where gardeners lack the access to the ground for a traditional garden.  Planting  Containers range from simple plastic pots, teacups to complex automatic-watering irrigation systems. This flexibility in design is another reason container gardening is popular with growers. They can be found on porches, front steps, and in urban locations, on rooftops. Sub-irrigated planters (SIP) are a type of container that may be used in container gardens.Note: SIP simply means watering from below, in large commercial applications it would not be strictly a container garden. Potting material must be loose and allow drainage to offer proper aeration for roots to breathe, preventing root rot.  Re-potting  Root-bound Re-potting is the action of placing an already potted plant into a larger or smaller pot. A pot that fits a plant's root system better is normally used. Plants are usually re-potted according to the size of their root system. Most plants need to be re-potted every few years because they become \\"pot-bound\\" or \\"root-bound\\". Plants' roots can sense its surroundings, including the size of the pot it is in, and increasing the pot size allows plant size to increase proportionally.  Advantages  Many types of plants are suitable for the container, including decorative flowers, herbs, cacti, vegetables, and small trees. There are many advantages to growing plants in containers, namely: *Less risk of soil-borne disease *Virtually eliminate weed problems *Mobile plants gives more control over moisture, sunlight & temperature  Gallery  File:Condominium balcony container gardening at night.jpgCondominium balcony container gardening at night.

The literature of this period is often equated with the Classicism of Louis XIV's long reign, during which France led Europe in political and cultural development; its authors expounded the classical ideals of order, clarity, proportion and good taste. In reality, 17th-century French literature encompasses far more than just the classicist masterpieces of Jean Racine and Madame de La Fayette. Society and literature in 17th-century France In Renaissance France, literature (in the broadest sense of the term) was largely the product of encyclopaedic humanism, and included works produced by an educated class of writers from religious and legal backgrounds. A new conception of nobility, modelled on the Italian Renaissance courts and their concept of the perfect courtier, was beginning to evolve through French literature. Throughout the 17th century this new concept transformed the image of the rude noble into an ideal of honn√™te homme (\\"the upright man\\") or the bel esprit (\\"beautiful spirit\\") whose chief virtues included eloquent speech, skill at dance, refined manners, appreciation of the arts, intellectual curiosity, wit, a spiritual or platonic attitude towards love and the ability to write poetry. Central to this transformation of literature were the salons and literary academies which flourished during the first decades of the 17th century; the expanded role of noble patronage was also significant. The production of literary works such as poems, plays, works of criticism or moral reflection was increasingly considered a necessary practice by nobles, and the creation (or patronage) of the arts served as a means of social advancement for both non- and marginalized noblemen. In the mid-17th century, there were an estimated 2,200 authors in France (mostly nobles and clergy), writing for a reading public of just a few tens of thousands.Alain Viala, Naissance de l'√©crivain,, Paris: Minuit, 1985, p.145 and pp.240-246. Under Cardinal Richelieu, patronage of the arts and literary academies increasingly came under the control of the monarchy. =Salons and Academies= Henry IV's court was considered by contemporaries a rude one, lacking the Italianate sophistication of the court of the Valois kings. The court also lacked a queen, who traditionally served as a focus (or patron) of a nation's authors and poets. Henry's literary tastes were largely limited to the chivalric novel Amadis of Gaul.Solnon, Jean-Fran√ßois. La Cour de France. Paris: Fayard, 1987. Chapter VIII. In the absence of a national literary culture, private salons formed around upper- class women such as Marie de Medici and Marguerite de Valois, devoting themselves to discussions of literature and society. In the 1620s, the most famous salon was held at the H√¥tel de Rambouillet by Madame de Rambouillet; a rival gathering was organized by Madeleine de Scud√©ry. The word salon first appeared in French in 1664 from the Italian word sala, the large reception hall of a mansion. Before 1664, literary gatherings were often called by the name of the room in which they occurred -- cabinet, r√©duit, alc√¥ve, and ruelle. For instance, the term ruelle derives from literary gatherings held in the bedroom, a practice popular even with Louis XIV. Nobles, lying on their beds, would receive close friends and offer them seats on chairs or stools surrounding the bed. Ruelle (\\"little street\\") refers to the space between a bed and the wall in a bedroom; it became a name for these gatherings (and the intellectual and literary circles evolving from them), often under the wing of educated women in the first half of the 17th century.Dandry, op. cit., 1149-1142. In the context of French scholastica, academies were scholarly societies which monitored, fostered, and critiqued French culture. Academies first appeared in France during the Renaissance, when Jean-Antoine de Ba√Øf created one devoted to poetry and music, inspired by the academy of Italian Marsilio Ficino. The first half of the 17th century was marked by a phenomenal growth in private academies, organised around a half-dozen or a dozen individuals who met regularly. Academies were generally more formal and more focused on criticism and analysis than salons, which encouraged pleasurable discourse about society. However, certain salons (such as that of Marguerite de Valois) were closer to the academic spirit.Viala. op.cit. Viala's first chapter is entirely devoted to these academies. By his count, 70 were created during the 17th century. In the mid-17th century, academies gradually came under government control and sponsorship and the number of private academies decreased. The first private academy to fall under governmental control was L'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, which remains the most prestigious governmental academy in France. Founded in 1634 by Cardinal Richelieu, L'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise focuses on the French language. =Aristocratic codes= In certain instances, the values of 17th-century nobility played a major part in the literature of the era. Most notable of these values are the aristocratic obsession with glory (la gloire) and majesty (la grandeur). The spectacle of power, prestige and luxury found in 17th-century literature may be distasteful or even offensive. Corneille's heroes, for example, have been labeled by modern critics as vainglorious, extravagant and prideful; however, contemporary aristocratic readers would see these characters (and their actions) as representative of nobility. The ch√¢teau of Versailles, court ballets, noble portraits, triumphal arches ‚Äì all of these were representations of glory and prestige. The notion of glory (whether artistic or military) was not vanity or boastfulness or hubris, but rather a moral imperative for the aristocracy. Nobles were required to be generous, magnanimous and to perform great deeds disinterestedly (i.e. because their status demanded it, without expectations of financial or political gain), and to master their own emotions (especially fear, jealousy and the desire for revenge). One's status in the world demanded appropriate externalisation ( or \\"conspicuous consumption\\"). Nobles indebted themselves to build prestigious urban mansions (h√¥tels particuliers) and to buy clothes, paintings, silverware, dishes and other furnishings befitting their rank. They were also required to show generosity by hosting sumptuous parties and by funding the arts. Conversely, social parvenus who took on the external trappings of the noble classes (such as the wearing of a sword) were severely criticised, sometimes by legal action (laws concerning sumptuous clothing worn by the bourgeois existed since the Middle Ages).This kind of expenditure mandated by social status has been studied by sociologists such as Norbert Elias (The Court Society. First English language edition: Oxford: Blackwell, 1983.); there are also many links to the theories of sociologist Marcel Mauss on the \\"gift\\". Another key analysis of these values can be found in the work of Paul B√©nichou (Morales du Grand si√®cle. Paris: Gallimard, 1948.). These aristocratic values began to be criticised in the mid-17th century; Blaise Pascal, for example, offered a ferocious analysis of the spectacle of power and Fran√ßois de La Rochefoucauld posited that no human act‚Äîhowever generous it pretended to be‚Äîcould be considered disinterested. =Classicism= In an attempt to restrict the proliferation of private centers of intellectual or literary life (so as to impose the royal court as the artistic center of France), Cardinal Richelieu took an existing literary gathering (around Valentin Conrart) and designated it as the official Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1634. Other original members included Jean Desmarets de Saint- Sorlin, Jean Ogier de Gombauld, Jean Chapelain, Fran√ßois le M√©tel de Boisrobert, Fran√ßois Maynard, Marin le Roy de Gomberville and Nicolas Faret; members added at the time of its official creation included Jean-Louis Guez de Balzac, Claude Favre de Vaugelas and Vincent Voiture. This process of state control of the arts and literature would be expanded even more during the reign of Louis XIV. \\"Classicism\\" (as it applies to literature) implies notions of order, clarity, moral purpose and good taste. Many of these notions are directly inspired by the works of Aristotle and Horace, and by classical Greek and Roman masterpieces. In theater, a play should follow the Three Unities: * Unity of place: The setting should not change. In practice this led to the frequent \\"Castle, interior\\". Battles take place off stage. * Unity of time: Ideally, the entire play should take place in 24 hours. * Unity of action: There should be one central story, and all secondary plots should link to it. Although based on classical examples, the unities of place and time were seen as essential for the spectator's complete absorption into the dramatic action; wildly dispersed scenes in China or Africa, or over many years would‚Äîcritics maintained‚Äîbreak the theatrical illusion. Sometimes, grouped with unity of action is the notion that no character should appear unexpectedly late in the drama. Linked with the theatrical unities are the following concepts: * Les biens√©ances (decorum): Literature should respect moral codes and good taste; nothing should be presented that flouts these codes, even if they are historical events. * La vraisemblance: Actions should be believable. When historical events contradict believability, some critics advised the latter. The criterion of believability was sometimes used to criticize soliloquy; in late classical plays characters are almost invariably supplied with confidants (valets, friends, nurses), to whom they reveal their emotions. These rules precluded many elements common in the baroque tragi-comedy: flying horses, chivalric battles, magical trips to foreign lands and the deus ex machina; the mauling of Hippolyte by a monster in Ph√®dre could only take place offstage. Finally, literature and art should consciously follow Horace's precept \\"to please and educate\\" (). These rules (or codes) were seldom completely followed, and many of the 17th century's masterpieces broke these rules intentionally to heighten emotional effect: * Corneille's Le Cid was criticised for having Rodrigue appear before Chim√®ne after having killed her father, a violation of moral codes. * La Princesse de Cl√®ves' revelation to her husband of her adulterous feelings for the Duc de Nemours was criticised for being unbelievable. In 1674 there erupted an intellectual debate (la querelle des Anciens et des Modernes) on whether the arts and literature of the modern era had achieved more than the illustrious writers and artists of antiquity. The Acad√©my was dominated by the \\"Moderns\\" (Charles Perrault, Jean Desmarets de Saint-Sorlin) and Perrault's poem \\"Le Si√®cle de Louis le Grand\\" (\\"The Century of Louis the Great\\") in 1687 was the strongest expression of their conviction that the reign of Louis XIV was the equal of Augustus. As a great lover of the classics, Nicolas Boileau-Despr√©aux found himself pushed into the role of champion of the Anciens (his severe criticisms of Desmarets de Saint-Sorlin's poems did not help), and Jean Racine, Jean de La Fontaine and Jean de La Bruy√®re took his defense. Meanwhile, Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle and the newspaper Mercure galant joined the \\"Moderns\\". The debate would last until the beginning of the 18th century. The term \\"classicism\\" is also linked to the visual arts and architecture of the period where it is also known as Style Louis XIV, most specifically to the construction of the Palace of Versailles (the crowning achievement of an official program of propaganda and regal glory). Although originally a country retreat used for special festivities‚Äîand known more for Andr√© Le N√¥tre's gardens and fountains‚ÄîVersailles eventually became the permanent home of the king. By relocating to Versailles Louis effectively avoided the dangers of Paris (in his youth, Louis XIV had suffered during the civil and parliamentary insurrection known as the Fronde), and could also keep his eye closely on the affairs of the nobles and play them off against each other and against the newer noblesse de robe. Versailles became a gilded cage; to leave spelled disaster for a noble, for all official charges and appointments were made there. A strict etiquette was imposed; a word or glance from the king could make or destroy a career. The king himself followed a strict daily regimen, and there was little privacy. Through his wars and the glory of Versailles Louis became, to a certain degree, the arbiter of taste and power in Europe; both his ch√¢teau and the etiquette in Versailles were copied by the other European courts. However, the difficult wars at the end of his long reign and the religious problems created by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes made the last years dark. Prose =Les Amours and Les histoires tragiques= In France, the period following the Wars of Religion saw the appearance of a new form of narrative fiction (which some critics have termed the \\"sentimental novel\\"), which quickly became a literary sensation thanks to the enthusiasm of a reading public searching for entertainment after so many years of conflict. These short (and realistic) novels of love (or amours, as they are frequently called in the titles) included extensive examples of gallant letters and polite discourse, amorous dialogues, letters and poems inserted in the story, gallant conceits and other rhetorical figures. These texts played an important role in the elaboration of new modes of civility and discourse of the upper classes (leading to the notion of the noble honn√™te homme). None of these novels have been republished since the early 17th century, and they remain largely unknown today. Authors associated with les Amours were Antoine de Nerv√®ze, Nicolas des Escuteaux and Fran√ßois du Souhait.The classic, albeit outdately judgemental, book on these early novels is: Reynier, Gustave. Le Roman sentimental avant l'Astr√©e. Paris: Corti, 1908. Meanwhile, the tradition of the dark tale‚Äîcoming from the tragic short story (histoire tragique) associated with Bandello, and frequently ending in suicide or murder‚Äîcontinued in the works of Jean-Pierre Camus and Fran√ßois de Rosset. =The Baroque adventure novel= By 1610 the short novel of love had largely disappeared, as tastes returned to longer adventure novels (romans d'aventures) and their clich√©s (pirates, storms, kidnapped maidens) that had been popular since the Valois court. Amadis of Gaul was the favorite reading matter of Henri IV; B√©roalde de Verville was still writing, and Nicolas de Montreux had just died in 1608. Both Nerv√®ze and Des Escuteaux in their later works attempted multi- volume adventure novels, and over the next twenty years the priest Jean-Pierre Camus adapted the form to tell harrowing moral tales heavily influenced by the histoire tragique. The best known of these long adventure novels is perhaps Polexandre (1629‚Äì49) by the young author Marin le Roy de Gomberville. All these authors were eclipsed, however, by the international success of Honor√© d'Urf√©'s novel l'Astr√©e (1607‚Äì1633). This story centered on the shepherd C√©ladon and his love, Astr√©e, and combined a frame tale device of shepherds and maidens meeting, telling stories and philosophizing on love (a form derived from the ancient Greek novel \\"the Aethiopica\\" by Heliodorus of Emesa) with a pastoral setting (derived from the Spanish and Italian pastoral tradition from such writers as Jacopo Sannazaro, Jorge de Montemayor, Torquato Tasso and Giambattista Guarini) of noble, idealized shepherds and maidens tending their flocks and falling in (and out of) love. The influence of d'Urf√©'s novel was immense, especially in its discursive structure (which permitted a large number of stories and characters to be introduced and their resolution to be delayed for thousands of pages; a roman √† tiroirs). D'Urf√©'s novel also promoted a rarefied neo-Platonism, which differed profoundly from the physicality of the knights in the Renaissance novel (such as Amadis of Gaul). The only element of d'Urf√©'s work which did not produce imitations was its roman pastoral setting. In theorizing the origins of the novel, the early 17th century conceived of the form as \\"an epic in prose\\"; in truth, the epic poem at the end of the Renaissance had few thematic differences from the novel. Novelistic love had spilled into the epic, and adventurous knights had become the subject of novels. The novels from 1640 to 1660 would complete this melding. These novels contained multiple volumes and were structurally complicated, using the same techniques of inserted stories and tale-within-a- tale dialogues as d'Urf√©. Often called romans de longue haleine (or \\"deep- breath books\\"), they usually took place in ancient Rome, Egypt or Persia, used historical characters (for this reason they are called romans h√©roiques) and told the adventures of a series of perfect lovers sent (by accident or misfortune) to the four corners of the world. Unlike the chivalric romance, magical elements and creatures were relatively rare. Furthermore, there was a concentration in these works on psychological analysis and on moral and sentimental questions which the Renaissance novel lacked. Many of these novels were actually romans √† cl√© which described actual contemporary relationships under disguised novelistic names and characters. The most famous of these authors and novels are: * Madeleine de Scud√©ry (1607‚Äì1701) ** Ibrahim, ou l'illustre Bassa (4 vols. 1641) ** Artam√®ne, ou le Grand Cyrus (10 vols. 1648‚Äì1653) ** Cl√©lie, histoire romaine (10 vols. 1654‚Äì1661) ** Almahide, ou l'esclave reine (8 vols. 1661‚Äì1663) * Roland Le Vayer de Boutigny (1627‚Äì1685) ** Mithridate (1648‚Äì51) * Gauthier de Costes, seigneur de la Calpren√®de ** Cassandre (10 vols. 1642‚Äì1645) ** Cleopatre (1646‚Äì57) ** Faramond (1661) =Baroque comic fiction= Not all fiction of the first half of the 17th century was a wild flight of fancy in far-flung lands and rarefied, adventurous love stories. Influenced by the international success of the picaresque novel from Spain (such as Lazarillo de Tormes), and by Miguel de Cervantes' short-story collection Exemplary Tales (which appeared in French beginning in 1614) and Don Quixote de la Mancha (French translation 1614‚Äì1618), the French novelists of the first half of the 17th century also chose to describe and satirize their own era and its excesses. Other important satirical models were provided by Fernando de Rojas' La Celestina and John Barclay's (1582‚Äì1621) two satirical Latin works, Euphormio sive Satiricon (1602) and Argenis (1621). Agrippa d'Aubign√©'s Les Aventures du baron de Faeneste portrays the rude manners and comic adventures of a Gascon in the royal court. Charles Sorel's L'histoire comique de Francion is a picaresque- inspired story of the ruses and amorous dealings of a young gentleman; his Le Berger extravagant is a satire of the d'Urf√©-inspired pastoral, which (taking a clue from the end of Don Quixote) has a young man take on the life of a shepherd. Despite their \\"realism\\" Sorel's works remain highly baroque, with dream sequences and inserted narration (for example, when Francion tells of his years at school) typical of the adventure novel. This use of inserted stories also follows Cervantes, who inserted a number of nearly autonomous stories into his Quixote. Paul Scarron's most famous work, Le Roman comique, uses the narrative frame of a group of ambulant actors in the provinces to present both scenes of farce and sophisticated, inserted tales. Cyrano de Bergerac (made famous by Edmond Rostand's 19th-century play) wrote two novels which, 60 years before Gulliver's Travels or Voltaire (or science fiction), use a journey to magical lands (the moon and the sun) as pretexts for satirizing contemporary philosophy and morals. By the end of the 17th century, Cyrano's works would inspire a number of philosophical novels, in which Frenchmen travel to foreign lands and strange utopias. The early half of the 17th century also saw the continued popularity of the comic short story and collections of humorous discussions, typified by the Histoires comiques of Fran√ßois du Souhait; the playful, chaotic, sometimes-obscene and almost- unreadable Moyen de parvenir by B√©roalde de Verville (a parody of \\"table talk\\" books, of Rabelais and of Michel de Montaigne's The Essays); the anonymous Les Caquets de l'accouch√©e (1622); and Moli√®re d'Essertine's Semaine amoureuse (a collection of short stories). A select list of baroque comique writers and works includes: * Agrippa d'Aubign√© (1552‚Äì1630) ** Les Aventures du baron de Faeneste (1617, 1619, 1630) * B√©roalde de Verville (1556‚Äì1626) ** Le Moyen de parvenir (c.1610) (with game that manages the composition and interchangeable gags, the book teaches boys mainly girls living in a good way) * Fran√ßois du Souhait (c.1570/80 ‚Äì1617) ** Histoires comiques (1612) * Moli√®re d'Essertine (c.1600‚Äì1624) ** Semaine amoureuse (1620) * Charles Sorel (1602‚Äì1674) ** L'histoire comique de Francion (1622) ** Nouvelles fran√ßoises (1623) ** Le Berger extravagant (1627) * Jean de Lannel ** Le Roman satyrique (1624) * Antoine-Andr√© Mareschal ** La Chrysolite (1627) * Paul Scarron (1610‚Äì1660) ** Virgile travesti (1648‚Äì53) ** Le Roman comique (1651‚Äì57) * Cyrano de Bergerac (Hector Savinien) (1619‚Äì1655) ** Histoire comique des Etats et Empires de la Lune (1657) ** Histoire comique des Etats et Empires du Soleil (1662) In the second half of the 17th century, contemporary settings would be also used in many classical nouvelles (novellas‚Äîespecially as a moral critique of contemporary society). =The Nouvelle classique= By 1660, the multi-volume, baroque historical novel had largely fallen out of fashion. The tendency was for much shorter works (nouvelles or petits romans), without complex structure or adventurous elements (pirates, shipwrecks, kidnappings). This movement away from the baroque novel was supported by theoretical discussions on novel structure, which sought to apply the same Aristotelian and Horacian concepts of the three unities, decorum and verisimilitude that writers had imposed on the theater. For example, Georges de Scud√©ry, in his preface to Ibrahim (1641), suggested that a \\"reasonable limit\\" for a novel's plot (a form of \\"unity of time\\") would be one year. Similarly, in his discussion on La Princesse de Cl√®ves, the chevalier de Valincourt criticized the inclusion of ancillary stories within the main plot (a form of \\"unity of action\\").See the edition of Madame de Lafayette's La Princesse de Cl√®ves edited by Bernard Pingaud (Paris: Folio, 2000. ). Valincourt's criticism is discussed on pages 267-9. Scud√©ry's one-year limit is mentioned on page 261. An interest in love, psychological analysis, moral dilemmas and social constraints permeates these novels. When the action was placed in an historical setting, this was increasingly a setting in the recent past; although still filled with anachronisms, these nouvelles historiques demonstrated an interest in historical detail. A number of these short novels recounted the \\"secret history\\" of a famous event (like Villedieu's Annales galantes), linking the action to an amorous intrigue; these were called histoires galantes. Some of these short novels told stories of the contemporary world (such as Pr√©chac's L'Illustre Parisienne).The classic work on the \\"nouvelle classique\\" is: Godenne, Ren√©. Histoire de la nouvelle fran√ßaise aux XVIIe et XVIIIe si√®cles. Publications romanes et fran√ßaises, 108. Geneva : Droz, 1970. Important nouvelles classiques were: * Jean Renaud de Segrais Nouvelles fran√ßoises (1658) * Madame de Lafayette La princesse de Montpensier (1662) * Madame de Villedieu Journal amoureux (1669) * Jean Donneau de Vis√© Nouvelles galantes et comiques (1669) * Madame de Villedieu Annales galantes (1670) * Madame de Lafayette Za√Øde (1671) * Madame de Villedieu Amour des grands hommes (1671) * C√©sar Vichard de Saint-R√©al Don Carlos (1672) * Madame de Villedieu Les D√©sordres de l'amour (1675) * Jean de Pr√©chac L'H√©ro√Øne mousquetaire (1677) * Jean de Pr√©chac Le voyage de Fontainebleau (1678) * Madame de Lafayette La Princesse de Cl√®ves (1678) * Jean de Pr√©chac L'Illustre Parisienne, histoire galante et v√©ritable (1679) The best-known of all of these is Madame de Lafayette's La Princesse de Cl√®ves. Reduced to essentially three characters, the short novel tells the story of a married noblewoman during the reign of Henri II who falls in love with another man, but who reveals her passion to her husband. Although the novel includes several inserted stories, on the whole the narration concentrates on the unspoken doubts and fears of the two individuals living in a social setting dominated by etiquette and moral correctness; despite its historical setting, Lafayette was clearly describing her contemporary world. The psychological analysis is close to the pessimism of La Rochefoucauld, and the abnegation of the main character leads ultimately to a refusal of a conventional happy ending. For all of its force, Madame de Lafayette's novel is not the first to have a recent historical setting or psychological depth (as some critics contend); these elements may be found in novels of the previous decade, and are already present in certain of the Amours at the beginning of the 17th century. =Other novelistic forms after 1660= The concerns of the nouvelle classique (love, psychological analysis, moral dilemmas and social constraints) are also apparent in the anonymous epistolary novel Lettres d'une religieuse portugaise (Letters of a Portuguese Nun) (1668), attributed to Guilleragues, which were a sensation when they were published (in part because of their perceived authenticity). These letters, written by a scorned woman to her absent lover, were a powerful representation of amorous passion with many similarities to the language of Racine. Other epistolary novels followed by Claude Barbin, Vincent Voiture, Edm√© Boursault, Fontenelle (who used the form to introduce discussion of philosophical and moral matters, prefiguring Montesquieu's Lettres persanes in the 18th century) and others; actual love letters written by noble ladies (Madame de Bussy- Lameth, Madame de Coligny) were also published. Antoine Fureti√®re (1619‚Äì1688) is responsible for a longer comic novel which pokes fun at a bourgeois family, Le Roman bourgeois (1666). The choice of the bourgeois arriviste or parvenu (a social climber, trying to ape the manners and style of the noble classes) as a source of mockery appears in a number of short stories and theater of the period (such as Moli√®re's Bourgeois Gentihomme). The long adventurous novel of love continued to exist after 1660, albeit in a far shorter form than the novels of the 1640s. Influenced as much by the nouvelles historiques and nouvelles galantes as by the romans d'aventures and romans historiques, these historical novels‚Äîwhose settings range from ancient Rome to Renaissance Castille or France‚Äîwere published into the first decades of the 18th century. Authors include Madame Marie Catherine d'Aulnoy, Mlle Charlotte-Rose de Caumont La Force, Mlle Anne de La Roche-Guilhem, Catherine Bernard and Catherine B√©dacier-Durand. A history of the novel, Traitt√© de l'origine des romans (1670), was written by Pierre Daniel Huet. This work (much like theoretical discussions on theatrical vraisemblance, biens√©ance and the nature of tragedy and comedy) stressed the need for moral utility; it made important distinctions between history and the novel, and between the epic (which treats of politics and war) and the novel (which treats of love). The first half of the 17th century had seen the development of the biographical m√©moire (see below), and by the 1670s this form began to be used in novels. Madame de Villedieu (real name Marie-Catherine Desjardins), author of a number of nouvelles, also wrote a longer realistic work which represented (and satirized) the contemporary world via the fictionalized m√©moires of young woman recounting her amorous and economic hardships, M√©moires de la vie d'Henriette Sylvie de Moli√®re (1672‚Äì1674). The fictional m√©moire form was used by other novelists as well. Courtilz de Sandras' novels (M√©moires de M.L.C.D.R. in 1687, M√©moires de M. d'Artagnan in 1700 and M√©moires de M. de B. in 1711) describe the world of Richelieu and Mazarin without gallant clich√©s; spies, kidnappings and political machinations predominate. Among the other m√©moires of the period the best-known was the work of Englishman Anthony Hamilton, whose M√©moires de la vie du comte de Grammont... (telling of his years in the French court from 1643 to 1663) was published in France in 1713. Many of these works were published anonymously; in some cases it is difficult to tell whether they are fictionalized or biographical. Other authors include abb√© Cavard, abb√© de Villiers, abb√© Olivier and le sieur de Grandchamp. The realism (and occasional irony) of these novels would lead directly to those of Alain-Ren√© Lesage, Pierre de Marivaux and Abb√© Pr√©vost in the 18th century. In the 1690s, the fairy tale began to appear in French literature. The best-known collection of traditional tales (liberally adapted) was by Charles Perrault (1697), although many others were published (such as those by Henriette-Julie de Murat and Madame d'Aulnoy). A major revolution would occur with the appearance of Antoine Galland's first French (and indeed modern) translation of the Thousand and One Nights (or Arabian Nights) (in 1704; another translation appeared in 1710-12), which would influence the 18th-century short stories of Voltaire, Diderot and many others. The period also saw several novels with voyages and utopian descriptions of foreign cultures (in imitation of Cyrano de Bergerac, Thomas More and Francis Bacon): * Denis Vairasse ‚Äì Histoire de S√©varambes (1677) * Gabriel de Foigny ‚Äì Les Avantures de Jacques Sadeur dans la d√©couverte et le voyage de la Terre australe (or la Terre australe connue (1676) * Tyssot de Patot ‚Äì Voyages et Aventures de Jacques Mass√© (1710) Of similar didactic aim was F√©nelon's Les Aventures de T√©l√©maque (1694‚Äî96), which represents a classicist's attempt to overcome the excesses of the baroque novel; using a structure of travels and adventures (grafted onto Telemachus‚Äîthe son of Ulysses), F√©nelon exposes his moral philosophy. This novel would be emulated by other didactic novels during the 18th century. Poetry Because of the new conception of l'honn√™te homme (the honest or upright man), poetry became one of the principal genres of literary production of noble gentlemen and the non-noble professional writers in their patronage during the 17th century. Poetry was used for all purposes. A great deal of 17th- and 18th-century poetry was \\"occasional\\", meaning that it was written to celebrate a particular event (a marriage, birth or a military victory) or to solemnize a tragic occurrence (a death or a military defeat); this type of poetry was favored by gentlemen in the service of a noble or the king. Poetry was the chief form of 17th-century theater; the vast majority of scripted plays were written in verse (see \\"Theater\\" below). Poetry was used in satires (Nicolas Boileau-Despr√©aux is famous for his Satires (1666)) and epics (inspired by the Renaissance epic tradition and by Tasso) like Jean Chapelain's La Pucelle. Although French poetry during the reign of Henri IV and Louis XIII was still largely inspired by the poets of the late Valois court, some of their excesses and poetic liberties found censure‚Äîespecially in the work of Fran√ßois de Malherbe, who criticized La Pl√©iade's and Philippe Desportes's irregularities of meter or form (the suppression of the cesura by a hiatus, sentence clauses spilling over into the next line‚Äîenjambement‚Äîneologisms constructed from Greek words, etc.). The later 17th century would see Malherbe as the grandfather of poetic classicism. The Pl√©iade poems of the natural world (fields and streams) were continued in the first half of the century‚Äîbut the tone was often elegiac or melancholy (an \\"ode to solitude\\"), and the natural world presented was sometimes the seacoast or some other rugged environment‚Äîby poets who have been tagged by later critics with the \\"baroque\\" label (notably Th√©ophile de Viau and Antoine G√©rard de Saint-Amant). Poetry came to be a part of the social games in noble salons (see \\"salons\\" above), where epigrams, satirical verse, and poetic descriptions were all common (the most famous example is \\"La Guirlande de Julie\\" (1641) at the H√¥tel de Rambouillet, a collection of floral poems written by the salon members for the birthday of the host's daughter). The linguistic aspects of the phenomenon associated with the pr√©cieuses (similar to Euphuism in England, Gongorism in Spain and Marinism in Italy)‚Äîthe use of highly metaphorical (sometimes obscure) language, the purification of socially unacceptable vocabulary‚Äîwas tied to this poetic salon spirit and would have an enormous impact on French poetic and courtly language. Although pr√©ciosit√© was often mocked (especially in the late 1660s, when the phenomenon had spread to the provinces) for its linguistic and romantic excesses (often linked to a misogynistic disdain for intellectual women), the French language and social manners of the 17th century were permanently changed by it.The classic on the \\"pr√©cieuses\\" is: Bray, Ren√©. La pr√©ciosit√© et les pr√©cieux, de Thibaut de Champagne √† Giraudoux. Paris: 1960. Much recent scholarship has been published, such as: Backer, Dorothy. Precious Women: A Feminist Phenomenon in the Age of Louis XIV. New York: Basic Books, 1974. From the 1660s, three poets stand out. Jean de La Fontaine gained enormous celebrity through his Aesop and Phaedrus-inspired \\"Fables\\" (1668‚Äì1693), which were written in an irregular- verse form (different meter lengths are used in a poem). Jean Racine was seen as the greatest tragedy writer of his age. Finally, Nicolas Boileau-Despr√©aux became the theorizer of poetic classicism. His Art po√©tique (1674) praised reason and logic (Boileau elevated Malherbe as the first of the rational poets), believability, moral usefulness and moral correctness; it elevated tragedy and the poetic epic as the great genres and recommended imitation of the poets of antiquity. \\"Classicism\\" in poetry would dominate until the pre- romantics and the French Revolution. A select list of French poets of the 17th century includes: * Fran√ßois de Malherbe (1555‚Äì1628) * Honor√© d'Urf√© (1567‚Äì1625) * Jean Ogier de Gombaud (1570?‚Äì1666) * Mathurin R√©gnier (1573‚Äì1613), nephew of Philippe Desportes * Fran√ßois de Maynard (1582‚Äì1646) * Honorat de Bueil, seigneur de Racan (1589‚Äì1670) * Th√©ophile de Viau (1590‚Äì1626) * Fran√ßois le M√©tel de Boisrobert (1592‚Äì1662) * Antoine G√©rard de Saint-Amant (1594‚Äì1661) * Jean Chapelain (1595‚Äì1674) * Vincent Voiture (1597‚Äì1648) * Jacques Vallee, Sieur Des Barreaux (1599‚Äì1673) * Tristan L'Hermite (1601?‚Äì1655) * Pierre Corneille (1606‚Äì1684) * Paul Scarron (1610‚Äì1660) * Isaac de Benserade (1613‚Äì1691) * Georges de Br√©beuf (1618‚Äì1661) * Jean de La Fontaine (1621‚Äì1695) * Nicolas Boileau-Despr√©aux (1636‚Äì1711) * Jean Racine (1639‚Äì1699) * Guillaume Amfrye de Chaulieu (1639‚Äì1720) * Jean- Fran√ßois Regnard (1655‚Äì1709) Theater =Theaters and theatrical companies= During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, public theatrical productions in Paris were under the control of guilds. During the last decades of the 16th century, only one of these continued to exist; although les Confr√®res de la Passion no longer had the right to perform mystery plays ( since 1548), they were given exclusive rights to oversee all theatrical productions in the capital and rented out their theater (the H√¥tel de Bourgogne) to theatrical troupes for a steep price. In 1599 the guild abandoned its privilege, which permitted other theaters and theatrical companies to operate in the capital. In addition to public theaters, plays were produced in private residences, before the court and in the university. In the first half of the 17th century the public, the humanist theater of the colleges and the theater performed at court exhibited a diversity of tastes; for example, while the tragicomedy was fashionable at the court during the first decade, the public was more interested in tragedy. Early theaters in Paris were often placed in existing structures like tennis courts; their stages were narrow, and facilities for sets and scene changes were often non- existent (this would encourage the development of unity of place). Eventually theaters would develop systems of elaborate machines and decors, fashionable for the chevaleresque flights of knights found in the tragicomedies of the first half of the 17th century. In the early part of the 17th century, theater performances took place twice a week, starting at two or three o'clock. Theatrical representations often encompassed several works; they began with a comic prologue, then a tragedy or tragicomedy, then a farce and finally a song. Nobles sometimes sat at the side of the stage during the performance. Since it was impossible to lower the house lights the audience was always aware of each other, and spectators were notably vocal during performances. The place directly in front of the stage, without seats‚Äîthe parterre‚Äîwas reserved for men, but since these were the cheapest tickets the parterre was usually a mix of social groups. Elegant people watched the show from the galleries. Princes, musketeers and royal pages were given free admission. Before 1630, an \\"honest\\" woman did not go to the theater. Unlike England, France placed no restrictions on women performing on stage; however, the career of actors of either sex was seen as morally wrong by the Catholic Church (actors were excommunicated) and by the ascetic religious Jansenist movement. Actors typically had stage names referring to typical roles or stereotypical characters. In addition to scripted comedies and tragedies, Parisians were also great fans of the Italian acting troupe who performed their Commedia dell'arte, a kind of improvised theater based on types. The characters from the Commedia dell'arte would have a profound effect on French theater, and one finds echoes of them in the braggarts, fools, lovers, old men and wily servants which still populate French theater. Finally, opera reached France during the second half of the 17th century. The most important theaters and troupes in Paris were: * H√¥tel de Bourgogne ‚Äì Until 1629 this theater was occupied by various troupes, including the Com√©diens du Roi directed by Vallerin Lecomte and (at his death) by Bellerose (Pierre Le Messier). The troupe became the official Troupe Royale in 1629. Actors included Turlupin, Gros-Guillaume, Gautier-Gargouille, Floridor, Monfleury and la Champmesl√©. * Th√©√¢tre du Marais (1600‚Äì1673) ‚Äì This rival theater of the H√¥tel de Bourgogne housed the troupe Vieux Com√©diens du Roi around Claude Deschamps and the troupe of Jodelet. * La troupe de Monsieur ‚Äì Under the protection of Louis XIV's brother, this was Moli√®re's first Paris troupe. It moved to several theaters in Paris (the Petit-Bourbon and the Palais-Royal) before combining in 1673 with the troupe of the Th√©√¢tre du Marais and becoming the troupe of the H√¥tel Gu√©n√©gaud. * La Com√©die fran√ßaise ‚Äì In 1680, Louis XIV united the H√¥tel de Bourgogne and the H√¥tel Gu√©n√©gaud into one official troupe. Outside Paris, in the suburbs and the provinces, there were many wandering theatrical troupes; Moli√®re got his start in such a troupe. The royal court and other noble houses were also important organizers of theatrical representations, ballets de cour, mock battles and other forms of divertissement for their festivities; in the some cases, the roles of dancers and actors were held by the nobles themselves. The early years at Versailles‚Äîbefore the massive expansion of the residence‚Äîwere entirely devoted to such pleasures, and similar spectacles continued throughout the reign. Engravings show Louis XIV and the court seated outside before the Cour du marbre of Versailles, watching the performance of a play. The great majority of scripted plays in the 17th century were written in verse. Notable exceptions include some of Moli√®re's comedies; Samuel Chappuzeau, author of Le Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßois, printed one comedy play in both prose and verse at different times. Except for lyric passages in these plays, the meter used was a twelve-syllable alexandrine line with a regular pause (or cesura) after the sixth syllable. These lines were put into rhymed couplets; couplets alternated between \\"feminine\\" (i.e. ending in a mute e) and \\"masculine\\" (i.e. ending in a vowel other than a mute e, a consonant or a nasal vowel) rhymes. =Baroque theater= 17th-century French theater is often reduced to three great names‚ÄîPierre Corneille, Moli√®re and Jean Racine‚Äîand to the triumph of \\"classicism\\". The truth, however, is far more complicated. Theater at the beginning of the 17th century was dominated by the genres and dramatists of the previous generation; most influential in this respect was Robert Garnier. Although the royal court had grown tired of the tragedy (preferring the more-escapist tragicomedy), the theatergoing public preferred the former. This would change in the 1630s and 1640s when (influenced by the long baroque novels of the period) the tragicomedy‚Äîa heroic and magical adventure of knights and maidens‚Äîbecame the dominant genre. The amazing success of Corneille's Le Cid in 1637 and Horace in 1640 would bring the tragedy back into fashion, where it would remain for the rest of the 17th century. The most important source for tragic theater was Seneca and the precepts of Horace and Aristotle (plus modern commentaries by Julius Caesar Scaliger and Lodovico Castelvetro); plots were taken from classical authors such as Plutarch and Suetonius, and from Italian, French and Spanish short- story collections. The Greek tragic authors (Sophocles and Euripides) would become increasingly important by the middle of the 17th century. Important models for the 17th century's comedy, tragedy and tragicomedy were also supplied by the Spanish playwrights Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca, Tirso de Molina and Lope de Vega, many of whose works were translated and adapted for the French stage. Important theatrical models were also supplied by the Italian stage (including the pastoral) and Italy was also an important source for theoretical discussions on theater, especially regarding decorum (see, for example, the debates on Sperone Speroni's play Canace and Giovanni Battista Giraldi's play Orbecche).See, among other works: Bray, Ren√©. La formation de la doctrine classique en France. Paris: Hachette, 1927. For an analysis of theatre development in the Renaissance, see: Reiss. Timothy. \\"Renaissance theatre and the theory of tragedy.\\" The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism. Volume III: The Renaissance. pp. 229-247. Regular comedies (i.e. comedies in five acts modeled on Plautus or Terence and the precepts of Aelius Donatus) were less frequent on the stage than tragedies and tragicomedies around the start of the 17th century; the comedic element of the early stage was dominated by farce, satirical monologues and by the commedia dell'arte. Jean Rotrou and Pierre Corneille would return to regular comedy shortly before 1630. Corneille's tragedies were strangely un-tragic (his first version of Le Cid was even listed as a tragicomedy), as they had happy endings. In his theoretical works on theater, Corneille redefined both comedy and tragedy around the following suppositions: * The stage‚Äîin both comedy and tragedy‚Äîshould feature noble characters (this would eliminate many lowbrow characters, typical of farce, from Corneille's comedies). Noble characters should not be depicted as vile (reprehensible actions are generally due to ignoble characters in Corneille's plays). * Tragedy deals with affairs of state (wars, dynastic marriages); comedy deals with love. For a work to be tragic, it need not have a tragic ending. * Although Aristotle says that catharsis (purgation of emotion) should be the goal of tragedy, this is only an ideal. In conformity with the moral code of the period, plays should not show evil being rewarded or nobility being degraded. The history of the public and critical reaction to Corneille's Le Cid may be found in other articles (he was criticized for his use of sources, his violation of good taste, and for other irregularities not conforming to Aristotian or Horacian rules), but its impact was stunning. Cardinal Richelieu asked the newly formed Acad√©mie fran√ßaise to investigate and pronounce on the criticism (it was the Academy's first official judgement), and the controversy reveals a growing attempt to control and regulate theater and theatrical forms. This would be the beginning of 17th-century \\"classicism\\". Corneille continued to write plays through 1674 (mainly tragedies, but also what he called \\"heroic comedies\\"). Many were successful, although the \\"irregularities\\" of his theatrical methods were increasingly criticized (notably by Fran√ßois H√©delin, abb√© d'Aubignac); the success of Jean Racine from the late 1660s signaled the end of his preeminence. A select list of dramatists and plays, with indication of genre (dates are often approximate, as date of publication was usually long after the date of first performance), includes: * Antoine de Montchrestien (c.1575‚Äì1621) ** Sophonisbe, AKA La Cathaginoise, AKA La Libert√© (tragedy) 1596 ** La Reine d'Ecosse, AKA L'Ecossaise (tragedy) 1601 ** Aman (tragedy) 1601 ** La Bergerie (pastoral) 1601 ** Hector (tragedy) 1604 * Jean de Schelandre (c.1585‚Äì1635) ** Tyr et Sidon, ou les funestes amours de Belcar et M√©liane (1608) * Alexandre Hardy (1572‚Äìc.1632) Hardy reputedly wrote 600 plays; only 34 have survived. ** Sc√©dase, ou l'hospitalit√© viol√©e (tragedy) 1624 ** La Force du sang (tragicomedy) 1625 (the plot is taken from a Cervantes short story) ** Lucr√®ce, ou l'Adult√®re puni (tragedy) 1628 * Honorat de Bueil, seigneur de Racan (1589‚Äì1670) ** Les Bergeries (pastoral) 1625 * Th√©ophile de Viau (1590‚Äì1626) ** Les Amours tragiques de Pyrame et Thisb√© (tragedy) 1621 * Fran√ßois le M√©tel de Boisrobert (1592‚Äì1662) ** Didon la chaste ou Les Amours de Hiarbas (tragedy) 1642 * Jean Mairet (1604‚Äì1686) ** La Sylve (pastoral tragicomedy) c.1626 ** La Silvanire, ou La Morte vive (pastoral tragicomedy) 1630 ** Les Galanteries du Duc d'Ossonne Vice-Roi de Naples (comedy) 1632 ** La Sophonisbe (tragedy) 1634 ** La Virginie (tragicomedy) 1636 * Tristan L'Hermite (1601‚Äì1655) ** Mariamne (tragedy) 1636 ** Penth√©e (tragedy) 1637 ** La Mort de Seneque (tragedy) 1644 ** La Mort de Crispe (tragedy) 1645 ** The Parasite 1653 * Jean Rotrou (1609‚Äì1650) ** La Bague de l'oubli (comedy) 1629 ** La Belle Alphr√®de (comedy) 1639 ** Laure pers√©cut√©e (tragicomedy) 1637 ** Le V√©ritable saint Genest (tragedy) 1645 ** Venceslas (tragicomedy) 1647 ** Cosro√®s (tragedy) 1648 * Pierre Corneille (1606‚Äì1684) ** M√©lite (comedy) 1629 ** Clitandre (tragicomedy, later changed to tragedy) 1631 ** La Veuve (comedy) 1631 ** La Place Royale (comedy) 1633 ** M√©d√©e (tragedy) 1635 ** L'Illusion comique (comedy) 1636 ** Le Cid (tragicomedy, later changed to tragedy) 1637 ** Horace (tragedy) 1640 ** Cinna (tragedy) 1640 ** Polyeucte (\\"Christian\\" tragedy) c.1641 ** La Mort de Pomp√©e (tragedy) 1642 ** Le Menteur (comedy) 1643 ** Rodogune, princesse des Parthes (tragedy) 1644 ** H√©raclius, empereur d'Orient (tragedy) 1647 ** Don Sanche d'Aragon (\\"heroic\\" comedy) 1649 ** Nicom√®de (tragedy) 1650 ** Sertorius (tragedy) 1662 ** Sophonisbe (tragedy) 1663 ** Othon (tragedy) 1664 ** Tite et B√©r√©nice (\\"heroic\\" comedy) 1670 ** Sur√©na, g√©n√©ral des Parthes (tragedy) 1674 * Pierre du Ryer (1606‚Äì1658) ** Lucr√®ce (tragedy) 1636 ** Alcione 1638 ** Sc√©vola (tragedy) 1644 * Jean Desmarets (1595‚Äì1676) ** Les Visionnaires (comedy) 1637 ** Erigone (prose tragedy) 1638 ** Scipion (verse tragedy) 1639 * Fran√ßois H√©delin, abb√© d'Aubignac (1604‚Äì1676) ** La Cyminde 1642 ** La Pucelle d'Orl√©ans 1642 ** Z√©nobie (tragedy) 1647 (written with the intention of affording a model in which the strict rules of the drama were served) ** Le Martyre de Sainte Catherine (tragedy) 1650 * Paul Scarron (1610‚Äì1660) ** Jodelet 1645 ** Don Japhel d'Arm√©nie 1653 * Isaac de Benserade (c.1613‚Äì1691) ** Cl√©op√¢tre (tragedy) 1635 =Theater under Louis XIV= By the 1660s, classicism had imposed itself on French theater. The key theoretical work on theater from this period was Fran√ßois Hedelin, abb√© d'Aubignac's Pratique du th√©√¢tre (1657), and this work reveals to what degree \\"French classicism\\" was willing to modify the rules of classical tragedy to maintain the unities and decorum (d'Aubignac, for example, saw the tragedies of Oedipus and Antigone as unsuitable for the contemporary stage). Although Pierre Corneille continued to produce tragedies until the end of his life, the works of Jean Racine from the late 1660s on totally eclipsed the late plays of the elder dramatist. Racine's tragedies‚Äîinspired by Greek myths, Euripides, Sophocles and Seneca‚Äîcondensed their plot into a tight set of passionate and duty-bound conflicts between a small group of noble characters, concentrating on these characters' double- binds and the geometry of their unfulfilled desires and hatreds. Racine's poetic skill was in the representation of pathos and amorous passion (like Ph√®dre's love for her stepson); his impact was such that emotional crisis would be the dominant mode of tragedy until the end of the 17th century. Racine's two late plays (Esther and Athalie) opened new doors to Biblical subject matter and the use of theater in the education of young women. Tragedy during the last two decades of the 17th century and the first years of the 18th century was dominated by productions of classics from Pierre Corneille and Racine, but on the whole the public's enthusiasm for tragedy had greatly diminished; theatrical tragedy paled beside the dark economic and demographic problems at the end of the 17th century, and the \\"comedy of manners\\" (see below) had incorporated many of the moral goals of tragedy. Other later-17th century tragedians include Claude Boyer, Michel Le Clerc, Jacques Pradon, Jean Galbert de Campistron, Jean de La Chapelle, Antoine d'Aubigny de la Fosse, l'abb√© Charles-Claude Geneste and Prosper Jolyot de Cr√©billon. At the end of the 17th century (in Cr√©billon's plays especially), there occasionally appeared a return to the theatricality of the beginning of the century: multiple episodes, extravagant fear and pity, and the representation of gruesome actions on stage. Early French opera was especially popular with the royal court during this period, and composer Jean-Baptiste Lully was extremely prolific (see the composer's article for more on court ballets and opera in this period). These works carried on in the tradition of tragicomedy (especially the pi√®ces √† machines) and court ballet, and also occasionally presented tragic plots (or trag√©dies en musique). Dramatists working with Lully included Pierre Corneille and Moli√®re but the most important of these librettists was Philippe Quinault, a writer of comedies, tragedies, and tragicomedies. Comedy in the second half of the 17th century was dominated by Moli√®re. A veteran actor, master of farce, slapstick, the Italian and Spanish theater (see above), and \\"regular\\" theater modeled on Plautus and Terence, Moli√®re's output was great and varied. He is credited with giving the French comedy of manners (com√©die de m≈ìurs) and the comedy of character (com√©die de caract√®re) their modern form. His hilarious satires of avaricious fathers, pr√©cieuses, social parvenues, doctors and pompous literary types were extremely successful, but his comedies on religious hypocrisy (Tartuffe) and libertinage (Dom Juan) brought him criticism from the church; Tartuffe was only performed because of the king's intercession. Many of Moli√®re's comedies (like Tartuffe, Dom Juan and Le Misanthrope) veered between farce and the darkest of dramas, and their endings are far from purely comic. Moli√®re's Les pr√©cieuses ridicules was certainly based on an earlier play by Samuel Chappuzeau (best known for his work Le Theatre Francois (1674), which contains the most detailed description of French theatre during this period). Comedy until the end of the 17th century would continue on the path traced by Moli√®re; the satire of contemporary morals and manners and the \\"regular\\" comedy would predominate, and the last great \\"comedy\\" of Louis XIV's reign (Alain-Ren√© Lesage's Turcaret) is a dark play in which almost no character exhibits redeeming traits. Below is a select list of French theater after 1659: * Comedies of Moli√®re (pseudonym of Jean-Baptiste Poquelin) (1622‚Äì1673) ** Les pr√©cieuses ridicules 1659 ** L'Ecole des femmes 1662 ** Tartuffe ou L'Imposteur 1664 ** Dom Juan ou Le festin de pierre 1665 ** Le Misanthrope 1666 ** L'Avare 1668 ** Le Bourgeois gentilhomme 1670 ** Les Fourberies de Scapin 1671 ** Les Femmes savantes 1672 ** Le Malade imaginaire 1673 * Thomas Corneille (1625‚Äì1709, brother of Pierre Corneille) ** Timocrate (tragedy) 1659, with the longest run (80 nights) recorded of any play of the 17th century ** Ariane (tragedy) 1672 ** Circ√© (tragicomedy) 1675 (cowritten with Donneau de Vis√©) ** Psych√© (opera) 1678 (in collaboration with Moli√®re and Jean-Baptiste Lully) ** La Devineresse (comedy) 1679 (cowritten with Donneau de Vis√©) ** Bell√©rophon (opera) 1679 ** M√©d√©e (tragedy) 1693 * Philippe Quinault (1635‚Äì1688) ** Alceste (musical tragedy) 1674 ** Proserpine (musical tragedy) 1680 ** Amadis de Gaule (musical tragicomedy) 1684, based on the Renaissance chivalric novel ** Armide (musical tragicomedy) 1686, based on Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered * Jean Racine (1639‚Äì1699) ** La Th√©ba√Øde (tragedy) 1664 ** Alexandre le Grand (tragedy) 1665 ** Andromaque (tragedy) 1667 ** Les plaideurs (comedy) 1668, Racine's only comedy ** Brittanicus (tragedy) 1669 ** B√©r√©nice (tragedy) 1670 ** Bajazet (tragedy) 1672 ** Mithridate (tragedy) 1673 ** Iphig√©nie en Aulide (tragedy) 1674 ** Ph√®dre (tragedy) 1677 ** Esther (tragedy) 1689 ** Athalie (tragedy) 1691 * Jacques Pradon (1632‚Äì1698) ** Pyrame et Thisb√© (tragedy) 1674 ** Tamerlan, ou la mort de Bajazet (tragedy) 1676 ** Ph√®dre et Hippolyte (tragedy) 1677; this play, released at the same time as Racine's, enjoyed momentary success * Jean-Fran√ßois Regnard (1655‚Äì1709) ** Le Joueur (comedy) 1696 ** Le Distrait (comedy) 1697 * Jean Galbert de Campistron (1656‚Äì1723) ** Andronic (tragedy) 1685 ** Tiridate (tragedy) 1691 * Florent Carton Dancourt (1661‚Äì1725) ** Le Chevalier √† la mode (comedy) 1687 ** Les Bourgeoises √† la mode (comedy) 1693 ** Les Bourgeoises de qualit√© (comedy) 1700 * Alain-Ren√© Lesage (1668‚Äì1747) ** Turcaret (comedy) 1708 * Prosper Jolyot de Cr√©billon (1674‚Äì1762) ** Idomn√©e (tragedy) 1705 ** Atr√©e et Thyeste (tragedy) 1707 ** Electre (tragedy) 1709 ** Rhadamiste et Z√©nobie (tragedy) 1711 ** Xerxes (tragedy) 1714 ** S√©miramis (tragedy) 1717 Other genres =Moral and philosophical reflection= The 17th century was dominated by a profound moral and religious fervor unleashed by the Counter- Reformation. Of all literary works, devotional books were the century's best sellers. New religious organisations swept the country (see, for example, the work of Saint Vincent de Paul and Saint Francis de Sales). The preacher Louis Bourdaloue (1632‚Äì1704) was known for his sermons, and theologian‚Äìorator Jacques-Benigne Bossuet (1627‚Äì1704) composed a number of celebrated funeral orations. Nevertheless, the 17th century had a number of writers who were considered \\"libertine\\"; these authors (like Th√©ophile de Viau (1590‚Äì1626) and Charles de Saint-Evremond (1610‚Äì1703)), inspired by Epicurus and the publication of Petronius, professed doubts of religious or moral matters during a period of increasingly reactionary religious fervor. Ren√© Descartes' (1596‚Äì1650) Discours de la m√©thode (1637) and M√©ditations marked a complete break with medieval philosophical reflection. An outgrowth of counter- reformation Catholicism, Jansenism advocated a profound moral and spiritual interrogation of the soul. This movement would attract writers such as Blaise Pascal and Jean Racine, but would eventually come under attack for heresy (they espoused a doctrine bordering on predestination), and their monastery at Port-Royal was suppressed. Blaise Pascal (1623‚Äì1662) was a satirist for their cause (in his Lettres provinciales (1656‚Äì57)), but his greatest moral and religious work was his unfinished and fragmentary collection of thoughts justifying the Christian religion named Pens√©es (Thoughts) (the most famous section being his discussion of the \\"pari\\" or \\"wager\\" on the possible eternity of the soul). Another outgrowth of the religious fervor of the period was Quietism, which taught practitioners a kind of spiritual meditative state. Fran√ßois de La Rochefoucauld (1613‚Äì1680) wrote a collection of prose entitled Maximes (Maxims) in 1665 which analyzed human actions against a deep moral pessimism. Jean de La Bruy√®re (1645‚Äì1696)‚Äîinspired by Theophrastus's characters‚Äîcomposed his own collection of Characters (1688), describing contemporary moral types. Fran√ßois de La Mothe-Le-Vayer wrote a number of pedagogical works for the education of the prince. Pierre Bayle's Dictionnaire historique et critique (1695‚Äì1697; enlarged 1702), with its multiplicity of marginalia and interpretations, offered a uniquely discursive and multifaceted view of knowledge (distinctly at odds with French classicism); it would be a major inspiration for the Enlightenment and Diderot's Encyclop√©die. Important Les Femmes and Grief des Dames and Digression about Montaigne's Essays by Madame Marie de Gournay =M√©moires and letters= The 17th century is noted for its biographical \\"m√©moires\\". The first great outpouring of these comes from the participants of the Fronde (like Cardinal de Retz), who used the genre as political justification combined with novelistic adventure. Roger de Rabutin, Comte de Bussy (known as Bussy-Rabutin) is responsible for the scandalous Histoire amoureuse des Gaules, a series of sketches of amorous intrigues by the chief ladies of the court. Paul Pellisson, historian to the king, wrote a Histoire de Louis XIV covering 1660‚Äì1670. G√©d√©on Tallemant des R√©aux wrote Les Historiettes, a collection of short biographical sketches of his contemporaries. Jean-Louis Guez de Balzac's collected letters are credited with executing (in French prose) a reform paralleling Francois de Malherbe's in verse. Madame de S√©vign√©'s (1626‚Äì1696) letters are considered an important document of society and literary events under Louis XIV. The most celebrated m√©moires of the 17th century, those of Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon (1675‚Äì1755), were not published until over a century later. we also remember Ninon de Lenclos's Lettres and the little book La Coquette veng√©e.

He was formerly bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kansas City-Saint Joseph, where he served from May 24, 2005, until he was compelled to resign on April 21, 2015. Finn is the only U.S. bishop to be convicted of the crime of failure to report a priest suspected of child sex abuse to government authorities.Eligon, John, and Laurie Goodstein, \\"Kansas City Bishop Convicted of Shielding Pedophile \\", New York Times, 7 September 2012 Early life and ordination Finn was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on April 2, 1953, the second of five children of Theodore (Pat) and Betty Schneider Finn. His family includes three sisters‚Äî Kathleen Fornwalt, Chesterfield, Missouri; Patricia Bax, St. Charles, Missouri; and Nancy Meyer, Maryland Heights, Missouri‚Äîand one brother, Richard Finn, of Keller, Texas. Finn completed his elementary education at All Souls Catholic School in Overland, Missouri. He studied for the priesthood at archdiocesan seminaries and in Rome. He is a 1971 graduate of St. Louis Preparatory Seminary North, and received a B.A. in Philosophy at Cardinal Glennon College in 1975. While a seminarian at the Pontifical North American College in Rome, he earned a Master's in Theology in 1979 from the Angelicum University. He served as a deacon in 1978-79 at Saint Charles Borromeo Parish, in the Archdiocese of Westminster. He was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of Saint Louis at All Souls Parish Church on July 7, 1979. Finn Served as pastor of Our Holy Redeemer Church in Webster Groves, Missouri, prior to being appointed the coadjutor bishop of Kansas City. Pastoral work Finn's first assignments were as associate pastor of two parishes in the Archdiocese of Saint Louis. He later was appointed to the faculty of Saint Francis Borgia Regional High School in Washington, Missouri, where he taught from 1983 to 1989. During those years, he lived in residence and served as part-time pastoral associate in area parishes. In 1989, Finn received a Master's in Education Administration from Saint Louis University and was appointed administrator of St. Dominic High School in O'Fallon, Missouri. During his tenure at St. Dominic's, he assisted the pastors of area parishes. He served the St. Dominic High School community until 1996. In 1996, he was appointed Director of Continuing Formation of Priests and, in 1999, while continuing as CFP Director, he was named editor of the St. Louis Review, the weekly newspaper of the Archdiocese of Saint Louis. Finn was named by Pope John Paul II a chaplain to His Holiness in August 2003, upon the recommendation of the Archbishop of St. Louis, Justin Francis Rigali, who had named him to the posts he was then exercising (the honor was bestowed while he was still serving as CFP Director and editor of the St. Louis Review; Finn received the title of Reverend Monsignor). Finn served in several other capacities including chairman of the Archdiocesan Committee on the Diaconate. Bishop Finn was named coadjutor bishop (with right of succession) of the diocese of Kansas City-Saint Joseph and was consecrated on May 3, 2004, at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Kansas City. He is also now a Fourth Degree member of the Knights of Columbus. On May 24, 2005, the Vatican accepted Bishop Boland's request for retirement. As Coadjutor, Bishop Finn automatically succeeded him as sixth bishop of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph. Finn became a member of the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, which is linked to the Catholic personal prelature Opus Dei. In an interview with the Catholic Key, Finn told of how Opus Dei had helped open his heart to the work of the Holy Spirit. Upon his arrival in the diocese of Kansas City-Saint Joseph in 2005, Finn said that vocations to the priesthood and religious life would be seen as a 'super- priority' for his diocese. Under his guidance, the diocese continued to pour considerable spiritual, human, and financial resources into efforts to encourage vocations. Before Finn's arrival, in the 2003/2004 seminary school year, the diocese reported having nine seminarians. For 2007/2008, the diocese reported that there were 24 men studying for diocesan priesthood. In March 2006, Finn invited to his diocese a small order of Benedictine nuns, now titled Benedictines of Mary, Queen of Apostles. The entire order moved from its place of founding, Scranton, PA. With a contemplative charism of praying and sacrificing for the sanctification of priests, in addition to operating a vestment design company called \\"House of Ephesus\\", these nuns saw their numbers rise quickly in recent years. , Finn served on the Administrative and the Priorities and Plans Committees for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, and had been chairman of the Bishop's \\"Task Force on the Life and Dignity of the Human Person\\". =Apology for lack of intervention= In May 2011, Finn apologized for his failure to act in a more timely manner in the case of a priest accused of engaging in inappropriate behavior with children. Finn told reporters that he failed to read a letter sent to the diocese a year earlier (May 2010) by a Catholic elementary school principal who was reporting numerous instances of inappropriate behavior. Finn's admission came five months after the diocese discovered questionable pictures of children on the Reverend Shawn Francis Ratigan's computer, and a week after the priest was arrested on child pornography charges.Kansas City Star: \\"Bishop again says he regrets response to priest in child porn case\\" May 27, 2011The Catholic Key: \\"Diocese faulted for handling of accused priest\\" June 8, 2011 =Independent investigation= On June 9, 2011, Finn appointed former U.S. Attorney Todd P. Graves to conduct an independent investigation of diocesan policies and procedures used to address sexual misconduct by church personnel including the case of Shawn Ratigan. Graves was the national co-chairman of the U.S. Justice Department's Child Exploitation Working Group. Finn also announced the appointment of an independent public liaison and ombudsman. In the report issued in September 2011, Graves said the key finding of the investigation was \\"that Diocesan leaders failed to follow their own policies and procedures for responding to reports\\" of sexual abuse by clergy. Criminal conviction for failure to report suspected child abuse The Kansas City diocese waited five months to inform police that inappropriate pictures of children at a diocesan school were found on the Reverend Shawn Francis Ratigan's computer. During that time, the diocese did not inform the community of this discovery and Ratigan took more inappropriate pictures of children he knew through church contacts. The indictment charged Finn with failing to inform police about child pornography found on Ratigan's computer. According to the indictment, the diocese was made aware of those images on December 16, 2010. Rather than reporting it, Finn ordered Ratigan to undergo psychiatric evaluation, then sent him to a convent under orders to have no contact with children. Without Finn's approval to do so, church officials reported Ratigan's actions on May 11, 2011 after learning that he had continued to take lewd pictures of children. Ratigan eventually pleaded guilty to five counts of producing child pornography and was sentenced to 50 years in federal prison.Aegeter, Macradee; Quinn, Kathy. Father Shawn Ratigan sentenced to 50 years in federal prison. WDAF-TV, 2013-09-12. On October 14, 2011, a county grand jury indicted both the Diocese and Finn personally for failure to report suspected child abuse, a criminal misdemeanor. While other bishops had been charged with directly perpetrating abuse, Finn was the first U.S. bishop to be charged in his role as a supervisor of priests, the first criminal case against a sitting bishop in the child sex abuse scandal in the Catholic Church. Finn was convicted on one charge in September 2012 and sentenced to two years of probation. All charges against the Diocese itself were dropped.McElwee, Joshua J., \\"Judge orders Kansas City bishop to stand trial in abuse case\\", National Catholic Reporter, April 5, 2012. =Investigation by Vatican and resignation= In September 2014, the Vatican initiated an investigation into Finn's tenure as bishop, conducted by Canadian archbishop Terrence Prendergast of Ottawa at the request of Pope Francis. The director of SNAP called the investigation \\"overdue\\".Paulson, Michael, \\"Vatican Investigates Missouri Bishop Who Shielded Pedophile Priest\\", New York Times, September 29, 2014. Retrieved 2014-09-30. Boston Cardinal Sean O'Malley, the leader of a church commission on child abuse cases, made critical remarks regarding Bishop Finn's actions. In an interview with the television news program 60 Minutes, O'Malley said that Bishop Finn's conviction for failing to report suspected child abuse would disqualify him from teaching Sunday school in the Boston archdiocese. \\"It's a question that the Holy See needs to address urgently,\\" O'Malley said.\\"Cardinal O'Malley: Vatican must address Kansas City bishop\\", AP via wcvb.com, November 15, 2014. Citation details retrieved 2015-04-25. The Vatican announced that Finn had resigned from the Diocese of Kansas City on April 21, 2015. Subsequent activities In 2016, Finn became chaplain of the School Sisters of Christ the King Convent in Lincoln, Nebraska. He offers Mass, hears confessions, and serves as a spiritual advisor for over 30 nuns. He has remained in this role as of July 2018, despite making occasional public appearances. Views =Tridentine Mass= In August 2005, Finn encouraged use of the Tridentine Mass in his diocese in accord with indult provisions established during Pope John Paul II's tenure, and welcomed the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest to the diocese to celebrate Mass at St. Patrick's Oratory, the city's oldest church.National Catholic Reporter: \\"An Affinity for Indulgences and Latin\\" May 12, 2006National Catholic Reporter: \\"Extreme makeover: the diocese\\" May 12, 2006 =Statement on the 2008 presidential election= In a pastoral letter published in the October 24, 2008, issue of the diocesan newspaper, The Catholic Key, referencing the upcoming presidential election, Finn wrote: \\"Our Catholic moral principles teach that a candidate‚Äôs promise of economic prosperity is insufficient to justify their constant support of abortion laws, including partial-birth abortion, and infanticide for born-alive infants.

It publishes in the mornings on weekdays (Monday through Friday) and in the morning on Saturdays. The Daily News was the state's largest family-owned newspaper until it was purchased by Gatehouse Media in 2017.  History  Large European beech in front of The Newport Daily News Until its sale to Gatehouse Media, the Daily News had been locally owned since it was founded in 1846. It was named Newspaper of the Year by the New England Newspaper Association in 1991, 2001 and 2004. In 1970, the newspaper moved from Thames Street in downtown Newport to an office on Malbone Road in the northern part of the city, shortly after the completion of the nearby Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge. In 2018, Gatehouse Media put the Malbone Road property up for sale, but the paper continued to be based out of the building until new office space in Newport can be found. In March 2019, the paper's office moved to Middletown, Rhode Island.  Sherman Publishing  Edward A. Sherman Publishing Company, the family-owned publisher of the Daily News, also prints three free weekly newspapers in southern Rhode Island: Mercury, a Wednesday alternative weekly covering Bristol, Newport and Washington counties; the Friday Newport Navlog, the U.S. Navy's oldest base newspaper (founded 1901), covering Naval Station Newport; and Ocean State Independent, mailed to non-Daily News subscribers on Aquidneck Island.\\"The Newport Daily News Advertising Rates\\", January 1, 2007.

The company also owned South County Newspapers, which publishes The Independent, a weekly newspaper covering the towns of South Kingstown (including the villages of Kingston, Peace Dale and Wakefield and the University of Rhode Island), Narragansett and North Kingstown. The Independent, formerly based in Wakefield, now shares office space with the Newport Daily News and Mercury in Newport. Sherman Publishing and all of its publications were purchased by Gatehouse Media, which also owns The Providence Journal, in October 2017. In June 2018, Gatehouse sold South County Newspapers, The Independent and South County Life magazine to Rhode Island Suburban Newspapers. In November 2018, publisher William Lucey and editor-in-chief Jon Zins both departed from the newspaper. Newport Mercury The Mercury, another publication of the Daily News, traces a lineage as one the oldest newspapers in the country. The history of that publication dates back to 1758, when the widow and son of James Franklin, Benjamin Franklin's brother, established the Newport Mercury as a weekly publication, making Ann Franklin the first woman in the Colonies to publish and edit a newspaper. The Mercury was published regularly up to the time the British landed in Newport, when the press and types were buried. (The press, also used by Solomon Southwick to print copies of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, can be seen in the Museum of Newport History in downtown Newport.) After the Revolutionary War, the Mercury was issued again. The Mercury was the first paper to publish poetry by an African American woman, Phillis Wheatley. The Mercury was acquired by Edward A.

The current iteration of the paper covers arts, entertainment, food and culture in Newport County. Since the Mercury ceased publication during the Revolutionary War, and was acquired by Sherman in 1928, Hartford Courant and the Mercury's publisher have a longstanding debate over which is older.

Born in Stepney, England, Hall later immigrated to the U.S. He made his professional debut on May 5, 1871. Early career Hall began his professional career with the Washington Olympics of the National Association in , hitting .294 in 32 games. He moved onto the Baltimore Canaries for the and seasons, hitting .336 and .345 respectively. Playing mostly center field up to this point, he moved around from center to right field the following year when he played for the Champions, the Boston Red Stockings. After just one season with the Red Stockings, he moved on to play for the Philadelphia Athletics where he had another good season at the plate, hitting .299, and four home runs, which was good for second place behind Jim O'Rourke's six. National League left After the 1875 season, the National Association folded, which left room for a new league to begin. In , the National League came into existence, the first official \\"Major League\\". Hall's team, the Athletics, followed that movement with very little success, finishing seventh out of eight teams. One of the bright spots that year for the Athletics was the hitting prowess of their star hitter, Hall. He led the team in almost all major hitting categories including a .366 batting average, 51 runs scored, and a league leading five home runs. On June 17, 1876, he became the first Major League baseball player to hit two home runs in one game. Those five home runs stood as the single season home run record until Charley Jones hit nine in . For the baseball season, Philadelphia had been expelled from the league for refusing to go on a western road trip, late in the 1876 season, for financial reasons, so Hall moved on to play for the Louisville Grays. Again, he had an excellent season, hitting .323, scoring 51 runs, and hitting 8 triples. Surprisingly, after appearing in the league leaders for home runs the last two seasons, he did not hit one in 1877. =Possible first cycle= Some baseball researchers attribute Hall as being the first major league player to hit for the cycle. In a game against the Cincinnati Red Stockings on June 14, 1876, Hall had five hits. Contemporary newspaper accounts agree that four of the hits were a home run, a single, and two triples; there is disagreement as to if the remaining hit was a double (which would complete the cycle) or another triple. The first undisputed major league cycle is attributed to Curry Foley of the Buffalo Bisons of the National League in 1882. Gambling scandal and banishment On October 26, 1877, Louisville club vice president Charles Chase confronted Hall and fellow Gray Jim Devlin with charges that they threw some road games in August and September. Both admitted only to throwing non-league games, one of which was an exhibition game in Lowell, Massachusetts, on August 30, and another in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on September 3. The admissions also implicated teammates Al Nichols and Bill Craver. Hall claimed that he and Devlin helped in losses to the Cincinnati Reds on September 6 and to the minor league Indianapolis Blues on September 24‚Äö but he argued that since the Reds were about to be suspended and the games nullified‚Äö it amounted to an exhibition game. As a result of the scandal, all four players were banned for life from Major League Baseball. Hall died in Ridgewood, New York, at the age of 74. He was buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

If both partners are absent a double proxy wedding occurs. Marriage by proxy is usually resorted to either when a couple wish to marry but one or both partners cannot attend for reasons such as military service, imprisonment, or travel restrictions; or when a couple lives in a jurisdiction in which they cannot legally marry. Proxy weddings are not recognized as legally binding in most jurisdictions: both parties must be present. Under the English common law, if a proxy marriage is valid by the law of the place where the marriage was celebrated (the lex loci celebrationis) then it will be recognised in England and Wales.Apt v Apt [1948] P 83; CB (Validity of marriage: proxy marriage) [2008] UKAIT 80 History The Wedding by Proxy of Marie de' Medici to King Henry IV by Peter Paul Rubens (1622‚Äì25) Starting in the Middle Ages, European monarchs and nobility sometimes married by proxy. Some examples of this include: * Mary, Queen of Hungary to Louis I, Duke of Orl√©ans, in 1385 * Henry IV to Joanna of Navarre, the daughter of Charles d'√âvreux, King of Navarre, on April 2, 1402 * Catherine of Aragon to Prince Arthur in 1499 * Anne of Austria to Louis XIII on October 18, 1615 * Charles I of England to Henrietta Maria of France on May 1, 1625 * Marie Antoinette to Louis-Auguste on April 19, 1770 * Napoleon I of France to Austrian Archduchess Marie Louise in 1810 Further, a famous 17th-century painting by Peter Paul Rubens depicts the proxy marriage of Marie de' Medici in 1600. By the end of the 19th century the practice had largely died out.  Today  , various Internet sites offer to arrange proxy and double-proxy marriages for a fee, although the service can generally be set up by any lawyer in a jurisdiction that offers proxy marriage. Video conferencing allows couples to experience the ceremony together. A unique \\"space wedding\\" took place on August 10, 2003 when Ekaterina Dmitriev, an American citizen living in the U.S. state of Texas where the ceremony was performed, married Yuri Malenchenko, a cosmonaut, who was orbiting the Earth in the International Space Station, by proxy.

Proxy marriages cannot be solemnized in any other U.S. states. In 1924, a federal court recognized the proxy marriage of a resident of Portugal, where proxy marriages were recognized at the time, and a resident of Pennsylvania, where common-law marriages could be contracted at the time. The Portuguese woman was allowed to immigrate to the United States on account of the marriage, whereas she would have been inadmissible otherwise due to being illiterate. During the early 1900s, United States proxy marriages increased significantly when many Japanese picture brides arrived at Angel Island, California. Since the early 20th century, it has been most commonly used in the United States for marriages where one partner is a member of the military on active duty. In California, proxy marriage is only available to deployed military personnel. In Montana, it is available if one partner is either on active military duty or is a Montana resident. In the United states if a proxy marriage has been performed in a state that legally allows it many states will recognize it fully or will recognize it as a common law marriage. The exception to this is the state of Iowa where it is completely unrecognized. =Germany= Germany does not allow proxy marriages within its jurisdiction (¬ß 1311 BGB). It recognizes proxy marriages contracted elsewhere where this is possible, subject to the usual rules of private international law, unless the foreign law should be incompatible with German ordre public (art. 6 EGBGB): this is not the case with the marriage by proxy per se, would be if, e. g., the proxy was held responsible for choosing the spouse without further asking rather than only contracting a marriage with a given spouse. =Catholic Church= Catholic Canon Law permits marriage by proxy, but requires officiants to receive authorization from the local ordinary before proceeding.

Description They grow to tall (rarely to ), and have alternate, simple ovate leaves 5‚Äì16 cm long and 3‚Äì8 cm broad. The flowers are pendulous, white or pale pink, produced in open clusters of 2‚Äì6 flowers, each flower being 1‚Äì3 cm long. The fruit is a distinctive, oblong dry drupe 2‚Äì4 cm long.

Halesia monticola is the largest of the genus, with specimens up to tall known in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina; the second-largest is H. macgregorii, reaching in China. The others rarely exceed tall. H. monticola is considered by some to be a subspecies of H. carolina (aka H. tetraptera). However, there appears to be a consistent size difference between the two taxa. Taxonomy The taxonomy and naming of the American species is confused and extensively disputed. The first dispute is over the exact identity of the specimen first named by Linnaeus as H. carolina; some contend that it is the same as H. parviflora,Reveal, J. L., & Seldin, M. J. (1976).

AbstractFlorida Institute for Systematic Botany: Halesia carolina The second dispute is over whether H. monticola is sufficiently distinct from the other species to merit specific recognition or not (with its varietal placing depending on the above question, too). Neither question has yet been conclusively answered. The treatment here includes both H. carolina (small) and H. monticola (large). A phylogenetic study suggests that Halesia is not monophyletic and as a result, the Chinese species Halesia macgregorii has been transferred into a new genus Perkinsiodendron, named after American botanist and Styracaceae expert Janet Russell Perkins. The genus was named after Stephen Hales by John Ellis, publishing the name in the tenth edition of Linnaeus's Systema Naturae in 1759. The name is conserved as the same name had been used in an obscure earlier publication in 1756 for a different plant.

He is currently the Apostolic Administrator of the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney, which is also called the Priestly Union of Saint Jean-Marie Vianney.  Life  Fernando Ar√™as Rifan was born in S√£o Fid√©lis in the diocese of Campos, Brazil and was ordained as a priest of that diocese on 8 December 1974. He joined the Priestly Union of Saint Jean-Marie Vianney, founded by Bishop Ant√¥nio de Castro Mayer, who was Bishop of Campos from 3 January 1949 until his retirement on 29 August 1981, and who had refused to accept in his diocese the revision of the liturgy of the Roman Rite by Pope Paul VI.Hall, Nicole. \\"Old Right Renaissance\\", CIEL-UK, conf. 2003 On 30 June 1988, Rifan acted as assistant presbyter at the Ec√¥ne Consecrations by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and Bishop Castro Mayer. On Bishop Castro Mayer's death on 25 April 1991, the Priestly Union, also known as the Sacerdotal Society of St. John Marie Vianney, chose as its leader Lic√≠nio Rangel, who was then given episcopal consecration by three of the four bishops of the closely associated Society of St. Pius X. As a result of contacts initiated by Dar√≠o Castrill√≥n Hoyos, Cardinal President of the Ecclesia Dei Commission in 2000, the members of the priestly union formally requested on 15 August 2001 reconciliation with the Holy See, as a result of which the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney was established with effect from 18 January 2002, with Bishop Rangel as Apostolic Administrator. For health reasons, Bishop Rangel asked Pope John Paul II for an auxiliary bishop, but the Pope recommended a coadjutor bishop. The Pope had promised to ensure episcopal succession for the Apostolic Administration, and a coadjutor would have automatic right of succession. Accordingly, Rifan, whom Bishop Rangel had chosen as his vicar general, was appointed Titular Bishop of Cedamusa and Coadjutor to the Apostolic Administrator on 28 June 2002. His episcopal consecration was held on 18 August 2002, with Cardinal Castrill√≥n as principal consecrator, assisted by Bishop Rangel and Archbishop Alano Maria Pena of Niter√≥i. On Bishop Rangel's death on 16 December 2002, Bishop Rifan thus immediately became head of the Apostolic Administration.  Views  In his first pastoral letter to the clergy, religious, associations and other faithful of the Apostolic Administration, Bishop Rifan stressed the importance of the papal mandate or canonical mission given to him, quoting the Council of Trent's anathema against any who would say that one who lacks it is a lawful preacher of the word of God and minister of the sacraments. He also warned those to whom he addressed his pastoral letter against two errors. One is heresy, attacks against the traditional Faith. He saw as a defence against that the traditional Latin liturgy and liturgical discipline that the Apostolic Administration keeps. The other error is schism, attacks against the unity of governance of the Church. Members of the Apostolic Administration must be on their guard against this too, he said, especially since their rightful efforts to preserve the Catholic faith had some unfortunate effects, in particular the onset of \\"a certain schismatic spirit that showed itself in a general taste for systematic criticism of Church authorities, a spirit of resistance, disobedience, disrespect, suspicion, backbiting, independence from the Church's Hierarchy and Magisterium, contentment with the abnormality of the situation, uncharitableness, a feeling of owning the whole of truth, a sectarian attitude that made us out to be the only good people ... with the underlying notion that 'the gates of Hell' had prevailed against the Church ‚Äì something that, through the infallible help of our Saviour, is impossible.\\" In another pastoral letter, written on the occasion of the election of Pope Benedict XVI as Pope, Bishop Rifan declared very pertinent to the present moment the words of Pope Pius XII in his encyclical Mystici Corporis, 41: \\"They, therefore, walk in the path of dangerous error who believe that they can accept Christ as the Head of the Church, while not adhering loyally to His Vicar on earth. They have taken away the visible head, broken the visible bonds of unity and left the Mystical Body of the Redeemer so obscured and so maimed, that those who are seeking the haven of eternal salvation can neither see it nor find it.\\" He has also stated that a \\"situation of separation of traditional Catholics from the hierarchy, provoked by the crises in the Church, besides being abnormal, must be temporary and momentary; it should inspire in us an anxiety for regularization and union rather than a complacency with our situation.\\"Old Rite Renaissance Bishop Rifan cooperated in 2013 with the Compendium of the Traditional Catechism of the Catholic Church, a guided version of John Paul II's Catechism by reviewing and approving the material of the Compendium.Aledo, Roniel. Compendium of the Traditional Catechism of the Catholic Church: Approved by His Excellency Bishop Fernando Areas Rifan from Campos Brazil, 2013 In a May 2003 interview with La Nef, Bishop Rifan spoke of the Apostolic Administration's relations with the Society of St Pius X as follows: :We have tried to be as friendly as possible with the SSPX and its superiors, but after we had informed them that we had serious reasons for continuing our contacts with Rome, which they did not intend to keep up, they began to criticize us severely, attempting also to dishonour us by putting in doubt our intentions and trying to create divisions among our faithful. After our recognition by the Holy See, the SSPX leadership removed our name from the lists of traditional Masses and began to foster Masses in the areas where we celebrate. Does that mean that the traditional Mass is good only when it is cut off from the Hierarchy? But thank God our faithful distinguish between love for the traditional Mass from the evil attitude that makes the traditional Mass a banner to wave against the Hierarchy. \\"Intervista con Monsignor Fernando Ar√™as Rifan\\", Una Vox ‚Äì Documenti The Society of St Pius X and other traditionalist groups have reproached Bishop Rifan for concelebrating Mass according to the revised rite on 28 May 2011.SSPX video of Bishop Rifan concelebrating Mass according to the present rite, French  References   External links  * Catholic Hierarchy Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian Roman Catholic bishops Category:Brazilian Traditionalist Catholics Category:Traditionalist Catholic bishops Category:Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney Category:Knights Grand Cross of Merit of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George Category:Former members of the Society of Saint Pius X ","title":"Fernando Ar√™as Rifan"},{"id":"2515116","text":"Samuel Bell Maxey (March 30, 1825August 16, 1895) was an American soldier, lawyer, and politician from Paris, Texas.

His parents were Rice and Lucy (Bell) Maxey. His father was a lawyer, and in 1834 he moved the family to Albany, Kentucky to take a position as the County Clerk for Clinton County, Kentucky. In 1842 young Maxey got an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Although he consistently ranked near the bottom of his class, Maxey did graduate in 1846 and was commissioned a Brevet second lieutenant. He was assigned to the 7th Infantry Regiment, which was engaged in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Maxey joined the regiment in Monterrey, Mexico. Maxey was cited for gallantry and brevetted first lieutenant for his actions in the battles of Cerro Gordo and Contreras in the summer of 1847. He also participated in the battles of Churubusco and Molino del Rey. He received a brevet promotion and was placed in command of a police company in Mexico City. In June 1848 Maxey was transferred to Jefferson Barracks in Missouri, and the following year he resigned from the army.Sifakis, Stewart. Who Was Who in the Civil War.

He married Marilda Cass Denton on June 19, 1853. Then in October 1857 father and son moved their families to a small farm they purchased just south of Paris, Texas. They resumed a joint law practice here as well. Civil War Samuel was elected the district attorney for Lamar County, Texas in 1858 and was a delegate to the state's Secession Convention in 1861. That same year he was elected to the state Senate, but never served, preferring military duty. His father, Rice Maxey, was elected to replace him. Samuel had been given authority by the Confederate government in September to raise a regiment as its colonel. In December, Colonel Maxey led his 1,120-man Ninth Texas Regiment from Bonham, Texas to join General Johnston at Memphis, Tennessee. However he was soon separated from his regiment and set to building bridges near Chattanooga, Tennessee. On March 7, 1862 Maxey was promoted to brigadier general to rank from May 4. The regiment was badly mauled at the Battle of Shiloh, but he was not present. In fact he saw very little action during this period. He did see action at the Siege of Port Hudson in 1863. In December 1863, General Maxey was assigned as commander of the Indian Territory. His early success in conducting raids and capturing supplies prevented a Union Army invasion of Texas. He was assigned to duty as a major general by General Edmund Kirby Smith, but this appointment was never approved for this rank by Confederate President Jefferson Davis nor confirmed by the Confederate Senate. In 1865 he was ordered to Houston, Texas, to take command of a Division. He turned over command of the Indian Territory to Brigadier General Stand Watie, a Cherokee, on February 21, 1865, and proceeded to Houston, Texas. Maxey's new command was plagued by desertions and his inability to get supplies and equipment. Frustrated and discouraged, he was allowed to resign on May 22, 1865. He returned home to Paris, and formally surrendered in July to Union Major General Edward Canby (E.R.S. Canby). Although nominally a prisoner of war, he remained at home on parole. Later political career Sam Bell Maxey House in Paris, Texas As a senior officer of the Confederacy, Maxey was not eligible to hold political office or even practice law. In October 1865 he began his appeal for a presidential pardon. He was finally successful when President Andrew Johnson pardoned him on July 20, 1867, after a personal appeal from Maxey's former West Point classmate Ulysses S. Grant. He resumed the practice of law in Paris. In 1872 he ran for the U.S. Congress, but lost in the Democratic Party Primary to William P. McLean. In 1873, Governor Edmund J. Davis offered Maxey an appointment to the Texas District Court, but he declined due to prior involvement as a lawyer with cases before the court. In January 1875, the Texas Legislature elected him to the United States Senate where he served two terms, from March 4, 1875 until March 3, 1887. He improved postal and rail service in Texas and argued against increased tariffs. He took little interest in larger national or party affairs. The legislature named the more dynamic John H. Reagan to replace him. Maxey returned to the practice of law in Paris, this time with his wife's nephew Benjamin Denton and Henry William Lightfoot. The latter of the two later married Maxey's adopted daughter Dora Maxey. When his nephew, Sam Bell Maxey Long, joined the firm in 1892 he finally retired. He died on August 16, 1895 at Eureka Springs, Arkansas, where he had gone for treatment of an intestinal problem. Samuel and Marilda are buried in the Evergreen Cemetery in Paris. The townhouse that he built there in 1867 is now a state historical site on South Church Street and is open to visitors.

The case, tried in the Durban and Coast Local Division of the High Court before Judge Hilary Squires, proved the fraudulent and corrupt relationship between Durban-based businessman Schabir Shaik and South African leader Jacob Zuma. Shaik's writing off of Zuma's significant personal loans in 1999 had raised suspicions about their financial activities. After Shaik's petition of appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal failed he started to serve his sentence of 15 years on 9 November 2006. After Shaik's brother, Chippy Shaik, was suspended from the Department of Defence for his involvement in a corrupt arms deal, Schabir Shaik was arrested in 2001 for the possession of secret documents, after which investigators found that he was involved in corrupt dealings with Zuma as well as fraud. He was brought to trial in October 2004, pleading not guilty. Shaik's trial was the subject of intense media attention due to the involvement of several high-profile members of the South African government. Though Shaik claimed that his financial dealings were legitimate, on 30 May 2005, the Durban High Court handed down its final judgment. He was pronounced guilty of corruption for paying Zuma 1.2 million Rand (US$185,000) to further their relationship and for soliciting a bribe from the French arms company Thomson-CSF, now Thales, as well as guilty of fraud for writing off more than R1 million (US$154,000) of Zuma's unpaid debts. Judge Squires sentenced Shaik to two terms of 15 years for corruption and one term of 3 years for fraud, to be served concurrently. Following the decision, Zuma stepped down from his seat in Parliament, though he remained deputy president of the African National Congress at that time. Thabo Mbeki, the standing President, also sacked Zuma as his deputy. Zuma was later elected as the president of the ANC. Shaik then attempted an appeal at the Supreme Court of Appeal. However, all five judges under President Craig Howie unanimously rejected his appeal, and agreed the correct sentence had been given over a year prior. Zuma's return from exile When apartheid ended, many former exiled African National Congress (ANC) leaders returned home to financially ruined lives, such as Jacob Zuma, one of the most important Zulu ANC members. Appointed MEC for Economic Affairs and Tourism in KwaZulu-Natal in May 1994 by the new ANC government, he thought that he needed much more than his salary from that position to make up for the time he spent fighting. Schabir Shaik, a member of the wealthy and important Shaik family of Durban, proved to be important in reestablishing Zuma's life. They had a profitable and discreet business relationship, which was only visible in a few unusual and incomplete documents and contracts, most of which were undated, and some were signed in the wrong places. Almost every document dealt with interest- free loans with no specified date of repayment. In 1999, Shaik wrote all the loans off without any explanation. Shaik, who was Zuma's financial advisor at the time, knew that Zuma could never afford to repay the sum of the loans on his salary. He also knew, since he had access to all of Zuma's financial records, about unpaid home loans, an overdraft of 66,500 Rand (US$10,200) in an account with Nedbank, one of South Africa's largest banks, another debt owed to Wesbank, and more money borrowed but not owed yet to Permanent Bank and Standard Bank. He knew that every month Zuma spent more money than his salary, and that he was writing bad cheques and failing to meet debit card payments. Shaik did not expect to be paid back, however, as he was buying influence with Zuma, which was used to win government contracts for his company, Nkobi Holdings. Through a series of share transactions, Nkobi Holdings merged with the French company Thomson-CSF, one of the largest arms companies in the world. On 21 May 1996, Thomson Holdings, the name of the newly merged corporations and now a South African company, was established. The first joint ventures Thomson made bids for were not for arms: instead, they made bids for an upgrade to Durban International Airport, a new ID Card for South African citizens, expansions to the N3 and N4, a new mobile phone network, and new smart card technologies. Arms deal Thomson Holdings, through its South African subsidiary, was seeking influence in government circles in this period, as the change from the National Party government to the ANC government had left it with few influential friends. To get an arms contract, it would need strong political backing. Fortunately for Shaik, his brother, Chippy, was in charge of arms acquisition at the Department of Defence. Chippy indicated that he would facilitate matters for Thomson Holdings if its 'position' regarding Chippy and his friends proved acceptable. Otherwise, he would make things difficult. The international end of the company also invested in the arms deal by buying shares of African Defence Systems, a bidder for one of the lucrative contracts in the arms deal. This bid excluded Nkobi Holdings, which was a shareholder of Thomson-CSF in South Africa‚Äîto Shaik's great consternation. In June 1996, Shaik held a meeting to tell his directors that they must gear up to bid for the electronic defence system needed to guide and protect South Africa's newly acquired corvettes. Shaik said that he would use his political connections to facilitate the contracts and tenders, because at that point both Shaik and Zuma were confident that Zuma would be made Deputy President in the post-Mandela government. Zuma was given more loans to facilitate the deal for Shaik and to help Nkobi receive more government contracts. The first newspaper article hinting at the relationship between Zuma and Shaik appeared at this time; however, it was insignificant. Published in the Cape Times, it was squeezed in between a report about a gangster gunned down in Cape Town and a car accident that claimed the lives of three people. Later, this article was considered the first mention of the case, although in January 1997 it was a brief news story: :'The police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the theft of classified military documents during an armed robbery at the home of Shamin 'Chippy' Shaik, which were in his car. The suspects were reported to have fled with Shaik's wallet, watch, and briefcase, which contained the documents. Shaik was not injured. Nobody was arrested.' Meanwhile, Shaik and Zuma wanted to establish a new venture, Nkobi Bank, to act as financial advisor to a bidding consortium on any large-scale public- or private-sector project. The bank would also compete for government and various ministry budgets as a deposit taker. Zuma was appointed as Deputy President in June 1999, and he began consolidating his assets, influence, and bank accounts. He started by developing his traditional residential village estate at Nkandla in Zululand in the rural northern part of KwaZulu-Natal. A contractor estimated the construction on the estate at R2.4 million (US$370,000), excluding VAT. Zuma negotiated with the contractor, and the final price was reduced to R1.3 million (US$200,000). Zuma was promised that construction would take six months, but it took nine. The money for the construction was not paid by Zuma himself; instead it was paid in installments by Bohlabela Wheels, Fakude PZN, and some in cash by Durban businessman Vivien Reddy, both in person by him and on one of his company's cheques. Nkandla development and selling influence To finance the continued construction on his estate, Zuma took out a bond, which \\"Reddy signed as ‚Ä¶ guarantor for R400,000 [US$60,000].\\" To continue his influence on Zuma, Reddy also paid the instalments on the bond, which came to nearly R12,000 (US$1,800) a month. Despite the regular monetary inflow, Zuma's financial troubles continued due to unforeseen costs in the Nkandla development. Zuma decided, therefore, to sell his political influence. Alan Th√©tard, then one of Thomson-CSF's directors, met with Schabir Shaik in Durban on 30 September 1999, during the course of which it was agreed that Th√©tard would give Shaik money to cover Zuma's debts in exchange for Zuma's protection from the commission investigating the arms deal, and ongoing support for any future Thomson-CSF deals with the South African government. During subsequent negotiations over the latter part of 1999, Shaik and Th√©tard agreed to a bribe amount of R1 million (US$154,000), and at a meeting in March 2000, Th√©tard, Shaik, and Zuma finalised the exchange. At this point, Zuma was in desperate need for money as the bribe was going to cover the continued construction of his Nkandla development, yet Th√©tard has not transferred any money to Shaik thus far. Shaik demanded an immediate response to this \\"extremely delicate matter\\" from Th√©tard, but Th√©tard failed to respond and by 19 October, Shaik in his role as Zuma's financial advisor, attempted to stop all construction on Nkandla, prompting Zuma to tell his contractors to ignore Shaik's orders. Zuma wrote a cheque for R1 million to his contractors, the payment of which was stopped by Shaik. By late 2000, Shaik knew that the South African Revenue Service (SARS) and the Scorpions would be watching all financial transactions made between him and Zuma, so the international division of Thomson-CSF sent an encrypted fax to Nkobi Holdings detailing a \\"service provider agreement\\" which updated the contract signed between Nkobi Holdings and Thomson-CSF for the delivery of the Corvettes. This agreement was used to disguise the payment of the bribe. The fax, which was later obtained in a raid on Shaik's office by the Scorpions, contained a non-bribery clause next to which Shaik wrote \\"conflicts with intention\\", yet despite the careful set-up, Thomson-CSF did not transfer any money to Shaik. Subsequently, Zuma went to meet with Th√©tard in Paris, following which R250,000 (US$38,000) was transferred by Thomson-CSF to the \\"Jacob Zuma Education Fund\\". As the year progressed, the relationship between Shaik and Zuma had attracted more attention, and by October 2000, South Africa's leading corruption prosecutor, Judge Willem Heath, formally asked President Thabo Mbeki for a proclamation allowing him to investigate the arms deal. Zuma immediately attacked the petition by writing a letter to Gavin Woods, the chairperson of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa). This letter, written in Zuma's capacity as \\"Leader of Government Business\\" in Parliament states that: Trial Schabir Shaik's trial started amid an intense media circus in the Durban High Court. Shaik pleaded not guilty to charges of corruption and fraud on 10 October 2004. He asserted in his plea explanation that the State had misunderstood his dealings with Zuma. He agreed that there was a financial relationship between Zuma and him, but that it was not a corrupt one as the payments he made to Zuma were loans made in friendship. He did not ask for any interest in the loans because it \\"offended his religious convictions\\". The loans had been made on a revolving credit agreement. He also denied allegations of fraud, saying money was mistakenly written off in his company's books, but that this was later fixed. To allegations that he was involved in soliciting a bribe for Zuma, he replied that he knew nothing. In lead prosecutor Billy Downer's opening address, he said his case would be based on facts and patterns and that \\"we will principally be talking of the arms deal.\\" The first charge against Shaik was one of general corruption. In their efforts to prove this charge, the State led a number of witnesses to show, as explained by Downer, that Zuma was \\"on retainer for Shaik.\\" =First charge: Corruption= The State argued in its first charge of corruption that Shaik had paid Zuma R1.2 million (US$185,000) to further a \\"general corrupt relationship.\\" To prove this charge, the State gave evidence of all the financial transactions between Shaik and Zuma. The State's first witness for this charge was Shaik's former secretary, Bianca Singh, who gave testimony while accompanied by three bodyguards. She stated that \\"Zuma was quite close to Shaik. They would speak on the phone and he would come to visit.\\" She also testified that Shaik arranged financial affairs for Zuma, managed his bank accounts on the computer, and discussed his financial situation with him. She concluded by saying that she knew that Shaik said the word Zuma often because she often overheard him while he was on the phone. The State's next witness was KPMG forensic auditor Johan van der Walt, who testified for several hours that the payments made by Shaik to Zuma \\"sometimes threatened the financial existence of the whole group.\\" He continued that the payments were not sensible for any other purpose than to buy influence with Zuma. Shaik's lawyers argued in cross-examination that their own forensic auditor showed that payments to Zuma were only a small percentage of the group's turnover. Van der Walt replied that \\"one can have a billion rand turnover and still have an overdraft. If you don't have the money, you can't operate.\\" Van der Walt also stated that Zuma lived well beyond his means, but seemed to accept that other people would pay his debts. Shaik's counsel, Fran√ßois van Zyl, said Shaik would testify that as far as he knew, Zuma had by now paid all his creditors and should have no problem paying him back. Van der Walt replied that whether the money paid to Zuma was a loan or a donation, he reaped the benefits: \\"My review indicated that Zuma had no access to major funds to repay his debts. The repayments must have taken place outside the period of review.\\" Van Zyl produced a written revolving credit agreement between Shaik and Zuma of which, he said, Parliament was informed. The State said it would dispute its authenticity. Van Zyl also accused Van der Walt of not taking into account that Zuma had repaid some money to Shaik. Ian McLeod, credit manager at Absa Group Limited, one of South Africa's largest banks, said that neither Shaik nor Zuma mentioned the agreement when they were asked to make a list of their assets and liabilities. From what he saw, he said that he \\"doubted very much if Zuma could repay Shaik.\\" Tracy O'Brian told the court that she sublet a flat to Shaik. Shaik told her that it was for his financial director. She later discovered, however, that when there were complaints about bodyguards with guns, Zuma lived there. Although Shaik or one of his companies paid the rent, it was always late. She terminated the lease. Abdool Qadir Mangerah said that he was a close friend of Zuma. He loaned Zuma R154,000 (US$24,000), and when Zuma could not pay him back, Shaik did. A balance of R4,000 (US$600) was still outstanding. He said that he helped Zuma out of friendship and gave him interest-free loans just like Shaik claimed he did. All Mangerah expected in return was \\"prays for [his] good health.\\" The State alleged, however, that several things were done in return. A former business associate of Shaik, Professor Themba Sono, told the court that Shaik told business partners that the Nkobi group could bring \\"political connectivity\\" to the table. Shaik said what he meant by political connectivity was Black Economic Empowerment (BEE). Professor John Lennon of Caledonian University in Glasgow told the court that Zuma advised him to use Nkobi as the South African partner for a proposed eco- tourism school. When Lennon seemed hesitant, Shaik threatened to derail the proposal and tell Zuma. A feasibility study for the project was cancelled after the government of the United Kingdom refused an application for funding. Shaik denied that he had anything to do with the sudden decline of the project. He said that his \\"unfortunate\\" correspondence with Lennon was prompted by his reaction to being \\"sidelined.\\" Zuma intervened when Thomson was hesitant to take Nkobi on as its BEE partner because Mbeki allegedly told them that he had reservations about Shaik and his business ventures. Van der Walt said Zuma intervened in sorting out Nkobi's shareholding in ADS, a company strategically placed to get a multimillion-rand contract in the arms deal. Van Zyl countered that both Mbeki and Mandela were involved in attempts to negotiate a BEE settlement for ADS. When the Malaysian Renong Group wanted local partners for a Durban development, Zuma proposed Shaik's involvement. Another Absa official testified that Shaik and Zuma were considered a \\"package deal\\" when the bank invited Zuma to become a private banking client. At the end of the testimonies for the first charge, Downer pointed out they need not prove that Zuma did anything out of the ordinary to help Shaik as \\"you can corrupt a politician by paying him to do something he is paid to do every day.\\" =Second charge: Fraud= The State proved in this charge that Shaik had more than R1 million (US$154,000) written off. Shaik owed this money to companies in the Nkobi group, and included payments made to Zuma. The write- off meant that it disappeared from Nkobi's books. Shaik said that it was a mistake and that he had his auditors fix it in subsequent financial years. Van der Walt said that it did not matter that it was fixed, as it was still a crime, asserting that \\"you can fix the amounts, but not the irregularity.\\" He said Shaik stood to benefit most from the write-off. He also added that the fact that an auditor was advising him did not reduce his liability as director. Shaik told the court that the company's auditors and financial director Colin Isaacs took full responsibility for the financial side of operations, that he was sure that the accounting books were in order, and that when he became aware of the problem he had it corrected. He had no intention to commit fraud. Auditing clerk Anthony Reed said he was instructed by Ahmed Paruk to effect the write-off. Paruk said he was instructed by Shaik to do it. He said Shaik told him that there was \\"no way in which he owed that type of money to his companies\\". Former Nkobi accountant Celia Bester said that the money written off was cash bribes paid to \\"various ministers\\" by Shaik. The writing-off, she said, was the main trigger for her final resignation. She told Judge Squires that she \\"saw it purely as bribe money\\". =Third charge: Corruption= For the second charge of corruption against Shaik, the State proved that Shaik had solicited a bribe from French arms company Thomson for Zuma. Zuma agreed to protect Thomson in return. As evidence for the charge, Van der Walt said there were clear signs that an \\"informal corrupt\\" process was followed, apart from the formal process when South Africa's multibillion- rand arms deal was concluded. Government auditor James Edward van Heerden, who did a special review of the arms acquisition process, also concluded that there were deviations from the accepted arms acquisition practices, with no plausible explanation. He told the court that their conclusions were that there should be a special investigation or forensic audit focusing on the involvement of contractors and subcontractors in the deal. The most controversial document produced by the State was a fax ostensibly setting out a bribe agreement between Shaik, Zuma, and Alain Th√©tard regarding the March 2000 meeting and R1 million (US$154,000) payment to Zuma. Both the handwritten fax and a disk with a typed copy were handed to the Scorpions by Th√©tard's former secretary, Sue Delique. Her evidence was backed up by forensic computer expert Bennie Labuschagne and handwriting expert Marius Rehder. Delique told the court that she was asked to type the note and fax it in encrypted form to Paris. After she resigned she told Thomson's auditors at the time, Gary Parker and David Read, about it. She refused to give them the documents. She told the court that she did not fax the agreement to Shaik. In response, Shaik testified that he \\"had nothing to do with Thomson in 2000\\". Parker and Read concluded at the end that she was a disgruntled employee. They found no proof of what she told them in Thomson's financial statements, and then dropped the matter. Shaik admitted that there was a meeting between himself, Th√©tard, and Zuma. But he said it was about a donation for the Jacob Zuma Education Trust. Singh told the court that an audibly agitated Shaik had phoned her from the golf course to tell her to tape hearings by the parliamentary standing committee on public accounts when Chippy Shaik was being questioned about the arms deal. She said he told her the next day that they were \\"focusing on the wrong person\\". Singh also said that she overheard Shaik calling Zuma the next day. According to her he said: \\"Hello my brother, Hello JZ. Chippy is under pressure. We really need your help to land this deal.\\" He later asked her to come to Mauritius with him to meet Th√©tard. Singh testified that at that meeting Shaik said they had to discuss \\"damage control.\\" And he said if the Heath Investigation Unit continued to probe the arms deal and if a certain ANC member opened his mouth \\"they would be in big trouble.\\" Shortly afterwards the alleged bribe agreement was concluded. Van der Walt said he found a great deal of correspondence about the payment of the money and a service provider agreement that Shaik concluded were used to mask the bribe. Only one payment was made of R250,000 (US$38,000); however, nothing was done to enforce the so- called \\"service provider agreement.\\" Shaik denied any attempt to bribe Zuma for protection and told the court that he did not know why Th√©tard wrote the note setting out the bribe agreement. He also testified that what the State thought was correspondence about the bribe was really about the donation to the education trust. Shaik said that the trust was in financial difficulty in 2000 and the donation was urgently required for them to be in a position to give bursaries for the next year. But Gerhardus Pretorius, who managed the Jacob Zuma Education Trust at the time, told the court that nobody ever told him of a significant donation expected from Thomson. Theunis Benemere, involved in the day-to-day administration of the trust, said that \\"there was always enough money\\". Former Judge Willem Heath told the court his unit was confident it would be included in the multi-agency probe into the arms deal. His unit was the most dangerous by far if there was evidence of corruption as it had the power to have the deal cancelled on \\"public interest\\" grounds. Heath said he was baffled when Mbeki refused to allow them to investigate. He said \\"I have no doubt that if objective consideration was applied the President would have no choice but to issue a proclamation\\". Heath's two former right-hand men, Gerhard Visagie and Jannie Lubbe, echoed his sentiments. The president of the Independent Democrats, Patricia de Lille, told the court she was handed information by people whose identity she did not disclose. She first asked for a commission of inquiry into the arms deal. When that was refused she asked Mbeki to issue a proclamation to allow the Heath unit to investigate. She said that her \\"role was to pass on the information and hope and pray that it will be investigated. I was ostracised, but I did it for the people of the country. I wanted to assist government to root out the few bad apples.\\" She was accused by Van Zyl of using the arms deal to attack the ANC, but she retorted that her \\"attack was on corruption.\\" Gavin Woods, who headed Parliament's Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa), told the court that they wanted a thorough investigation of the arms deal. It would have included their own investigation as well as one by four agencies including the Heath Special Investigating Unit. He received a letter from Zuma, written in his capacity as leader of government business, saying that government saw no need for the Heath Unit to be involved. At the time, Woods said there was no clarity on what it was the \\"leader of government business\\" was supposed to do. Under cross-examination he conceded that the director of public prosecutions, the auditor-general and the public protector also wanted Heath excluded. Zuma said that when he was asked in Parliament if the revelations at the Shaik trial were a blot on the moral regeneration programme headed by him, he replied, \\"not at all, I don't look at it that way. Not at all, honourable members.\\" Squires' judgement The Defence rested its case on 7 April 2005, which was followed by the State's final arguments on 28 April. Judge Squires said that he would not be prepared to give any judgment before 30 May. In his final statements, Judge Squires thanked the defence and the prosecutor for the \\"meticulous and careful manner\\" in which they \\"presented their cases\\", which he said made the \\"court's task easier,\\" especially when seen in the light of the difficult and complex nature of the case. The formal part of the trial ended shortly after the defence counsel asked the court to consider the possibility that Shaik had sought a bribe of R500,000 (US$77,000) a year from Thompson-CSF without Zuma's knowledge. The defence stated, however, that this version should only be considered if the court rejected their original argument. Judge Squires reconvened the court on 7 June to deliver his sentence. Describing corruption as a \\"pervasive and insidious evil,\\" he found that Shaik's actions had been aimed at advancing his business interests through an association with Zuma: : \\"His corporate empire's progress and prosperity was plainly linked to the possibility that Jacob Zuma would finally ascend to the highest political office. What was important to him was the achievement of a large multi-corporate business group ... And the power that goes with that and close association with the greatest in the land. It is precisely in such circumstances that corruption works\\". Judge Squires also said that he was convinced that Shaik gave Zuma \\"a sustained level of support\\" designed to maintain a lifestyle the politician could never have afforded otherwise, and that this was an investment in Zuma's political profile from which Shaik expected to benefit. Judge Squires continued that the payments \\"were not ... to a low-salaried bureaucrat seduced into temptation,\\" and that the higher the status of the beneficiary, the more serious the offence. Judge Squires found Shaik guilty of a generally corrupt relationship with Zuma and for soliciting a bribe for Zuma from Thomson-CSF. He was also found guilty of fraud for irregularly writing off loans from the books of Nkobi Group. Judge Squires dismissed Shaik's anti-apartheid \\"struggle credentials\\", saying what he had sought to achieve was exactly the same as the apartheid regime's \\"command of the economy\\" by a privileged few, which is exactly what the struggle had sought to replace. The judge sentenced Shaik to the minimum prescribed sentence of 15 years on each of the corruption counts. Shaik was sentenced to three years for fraud; however, Judge Squires said he found mitigating circumstances for not imposing the same minimum penalty for the fraud charge, as Shaik had not been the instigator and the crime had no adverse effect on any other party. Judge Squires ordered that the three sentences run concurrently and described Shaik as a man with commendable vision, ambition, and energy, but one who appears to have lost his moral compass and scruples. The judge also imposed a series of fines on 10 companies related to the Nkobi Group. Concluding the sentencing proceedings, Squires said: :\\"I do not think I am overstating anything when I say that this phenomenon [of corruption] can truly be likened to a cancer eating away remorselessly at the fabric of corporate privacy and extending its baleful effect into all aspects of administrative functions, whether state official or private sector manager. If it is not checked, it becomes systemic. And the after-effects of systemic corruption can quite readily extend to the corrosion of any confidence in the integrity of anyone who has a duty to discharge, especially a duty to discharge to the public.\\" :\\"One can hopefully discount the prospect of it happening in this country, but it is that sort of increasing disaffection which leads and has led on other parts of our continent and elsewhere to coups d'√©tat or the rise of populace leaders who in turn manipulate politics for even greater private benefit ... This is the last step in a thousand mile journey.\\" Shaik immediately announced his intentions to appeal the sentence, and Judge Squires set aside 26 July as the date of a hearing for Shaik's leave to appeal. Fallout The political nature of the trial prompted immediate reactions from all sides of the political and economic spectrum in South Africa. Non-ANC-aligned parties immediately praised the verdict as it weakened the moral position of the ANC. Groups hostile to the ANC immediately demanded that Zuma be charged with corruption as well. The leader of the United Democratic Movement, Bantu Holomisa, issued a press release strongly in favour of charging Zuma. He stated that \\"we [the UDM] hope that this was merely phase one of the prosecution process: Schabir Shaik has been prosecuted as the corruptor. Phase two must necessarily be to prosecute the corruptee. It would be an embarrassment for the country to have a serving deputy president arrested and prosecuted. Therefore President Mbeki must fire Mr Zuma if he does not resign\\". The press report concluded by saying that the 15-year jail sentence was confirmation that South African society would not tolerate those who were guilty of corruption. Democratic Alliance MP Sheila Camerer echoed Holomisa's sentiments: \\"The DA [Democratic Alliance] has maintained since August 2003 that the deputy president ... should have been charged with Shaik. We believe he should be charged now in view of Judge Squires' finding that he was complicit in both counts of corruption\\". Independent Democrats leader Patricia de Lille also said the sentence should prove a deterrent: \\"Schabir Shaik has been handed the justice all South Africans needed to hear and that this should prove as a deterrent for anyone in the future. We should all celebrate the restoration of faith in our country by the local and international community with this judgement.\\" The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the most powerful trade union federation in South Africa, openly supported Zuma. However, its spokesman, Paul Notyhawa, said that it respected the court's decision: \\"We definitely have to respect the court's decision in the matter, noting that the accused has reserved his right to appeal\\". Notyhawa said that Cosatu had never objected to the trial of Shaik, but he went on to say that \\"what we object to is that the judge erred in implicating a person who has not been part of the proceedings and has been denied his right to respond in a proper forum\\". The majority of the press called for Zuma to resign. Under intense pressure from within the ANC as well as the public, Zuma's spokesperson Lakela Kaunda announced on 14 June 2005 that Zuma would resign his seat in parliament. The ANC issued a statement later in the day accepting Zuma's resignation. Kaunda further explained that Zuma would stop his activities in parliament the next day and would write a letter to the speaker to inform her of his decision, clarifying that \\"the bottom line is that you won't see him [Zuma] in parliament again, at least not as a member\\". The ANC's statement read that it \\"respects the position taken by Deputy President Zuma to resign as a member of parliament\\". Zuma, in response to the ANC, said that \\"President Thabo Mbeki has taken a decision regarding my presence in government and cabinet. It is the president's prerogative to take such a decision, in the context of, and within his authority as the president of the republic in light of this decision. I have also offered to resign my seat in parliament not as an admission of guilt of any kind, but to make it easier for the ANC and government to function in parliament.\\" According to the statement, Zuma planned to stay on as deputy president of the ANC. Cosatu immediately reacted negatively to Zuma's resignation, prompting protests and calls for Zuma to be reinstated, although they represented a minority of the South African public. Zuma was charged with corruption as a result of the trial, although he continued to enjoy support from leftist and Zulu elements of the ANC. His support did appear to decline significantly (but not entirely collapse) after being charged with an unrelated rape case late in 2005, which led to him suspending his activities within the ANC. Appeal =Supreme Court of Appeal= Judge Squires granted Shaik the right to an appeal in the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein against his fraud and one of his corruption convictions. After being granted his reprieve, Shaik told reporters in a press conference that he was grateful and intended to use the options made available to him. He concluded the press conference by stating that \\"obviously one would have liked to be victorious on all the charges, but we are in the legal process\\". Many reporters asked him if he would petition the Chief Justice to appeal the convictions that Judge Squires denied grounds of appeal, to which Shaik replied that his legal team was considering the matter. The National Prosecuting Authority, as represented by spokesperson Makhosini Nkosi in front of the courthouse, said that it accepted Judge Squires' decision, despite some disappointment. Nkosi also said that \\"We [the NPA] are satisfied that the judge applied his mind correctly to all the facts. In some cases, we are naturally disappointed, but even then you appreciate the reasons for coming to that decision\\". Judge Squires extended Shaik's R100,000 (US$15,000) bail. It took more than a year for the Supreme Court of Appeal Court to pass a ruling on the two appeals as well as the application from Shaiks' legal team for leave of appeal on the second corruption charge (which Squires had declined to award). However, on 6 November 2006, President Craig Howie on a bench of 5 judges, rejected this right to appeal. The appeal judges found that Shaik was correctly convicted on three charges of corruption and that the sentence was fair. Furthermore, the court found that Shaik's actions went against the very fibre of the constitution. Shaik reported to jail to start serving his effective 15-year sentence. On 3 March 2009, Shaik was released on medical parole, after serving two years and four months of his 15-year prison term.Opposition slams release of Schabir Shaik M&G;Expert: Shaik's release strange News24Parole only for terminally ill, says judge M&G; =Constitutional Court= Mr Shaik applied for leave to appeal to the Constitutional Court in Johannesburg, against his conviction and sentence, and consequential steps. In October 2007 the Court dismissed most elements of the application, finding that most of the grounds for appeal submitted by Shaik had no prospect of success. However, it granted leave to appeal against the order for confiscation of his assets. Shaik and his companies (Nkobi Holdings and Nkobi Investments) then appealed to the Constitutional Court to question the validity of the confiscation order regarding R33 million of their assets. The original court authorised the confiscation under the Prevention of Organised Crime Act (POCA), since it held that they constitute proceeds of crime. In April 2008 the Constitutional Court dismissed this appeal, finding that Shaik and his companies had received their shareholdings in Thint, a major ground for the asset forfeiture order, as a result of \\"the corrupt payments\\" made to Zuma, and that the remainder of the order related to dividends that accrued due to this shareholding. The court ruled that POCA permitted that all benefits that had arisen from the commission of a crime, whether directly or indirectly, may be confiscated by the trial court after it convicted an accused; and that the trial court had discretion to determine the appropriate amount in any given case. The court concluded that Shaik and his companies had not shown that the High Court improperly exercised its discretion to determine the amount to be confiscated nor that the order confiscating both the shareholding and the dividend was \\"disturbingly inappropriate\\". References in popular culture In November 2006 the South African comic strip Madam & Eve ran a series of strips lampooning Shaik's arrival in prison.

Biography  Born in Madras, he was the son of an Indian army officer. Osborn entered the navy as a first-class volunteer in 1837, serving until 1844 on , , and . In 1838, he was entrusted with the command of a gunboat at the attack on Kedah in the Malay Peninsula, and was present at the Battle of Canton in 1841, and at the Battle of Woosung in 1842. From 1844 until 1848, he was gunnery mate and lieutenant on , the flagship of Sir George Seymour in the Pacific. He took a prominent part in 1849 in advocating a new search expedition for Sir John Franklin, and in 1850 was appointed to the command of the steam-tender in the Arctic expedition under Horatio Thomas Austin, in the course of which he performed a remarkable sledge-journey to the western extremity of Prince of Wales Island. He published an account of this voyage, entitled Stray Leaves from an Arctic Journal (1852), and was promoted to the rank of commander shortly afterwards. In the new expedition of 1852‚Äì1854 under Sir Edward Belcher he again took part as commander of Pioneer. In 1856, he published the journals of Captain Robert McClure, giving a narrative of the discovery of the Northwest Passage. Early in 1855, he was called to active service in the Crimean War as the captain of . After seeing considerable action in the Black Sea he was promoted to post-rank in August 1855, and was appointed to , in which he commanded the Sea of Azov squadron until the end of the war. For these services he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, awarded the Legion of Honour, and the Turkish Order of the Medjidie. In 1859 he published the work A cruise in Japanese waters, The fight on the Peiho. As captain of , he took a prominent part in the operations of the Second Opium War, and performed a piece of difficult and intricate navigation in taking his ship up the Yangtse to Hankow in 1858. He returned to England in broken health in 1859, and at this time contributed a number of articles on naval and Chinese topics to Blackwood's Magazine, and wrote The Career, Last Voyage and Fate of Sir John Franklin (1860). In 1861, he commanded in the Gulf of Mexico during the Second French intervention in Mexico, and in 1862, undertook the command of a squadron fitted out by the Chinese government for the suppression of piracy on the coast of China. Owing to the non-fulfilment of the condition that he should receive orders from the imperial government only, he quit the appointment. =Lay-Osborn Flotilla= During the Taiping Rebellion the Chinese government wished to regain control over Nanjing, which had been captured by the rebel forces in 1853 and declared their capital, but lacked the necessary ships to bring troops down the Yangtze River and to provide fire support. The Chinese government turned to the British for help, who agreed to provide assistance in order to bring stability to their commerce in China. The Chinese Emperor, exiled to Jehol, agreed to a proposal presented by British ambassador Sir Frederic Bruce in July 1861 to purchase British gunboats. Robert Hart, interpreter of the Imperial Maritime Customs Service is given credit for creating the proposal. Prince Gong, the head of the Zongli Yamen, appointed Horatio Nelson Lay as Inspector General of the new flotilla. Lay left China for England on 14March 1862 with written instructions from Prince Gong. Queen Victoria agreed to the proposal on 2September 1862 and gave permission to equip the vessels and hire crews. Lay appointed Captain Sherard Osborn as commander of the flotilla. On 13February 1863 the ‚ÄúLay-Osborn‚Äù flotilla, also known as the Osborn or \\"Vampire\\" Fleet, with seven steam cruisers and a supply ship left England, arriving in China in September 1863. Upon reaching China, Osborn refused to take any orders from local Chinese officers, stating that his agreement with Lay stipulated that any Chinese orders must come directly from the Tongzhi Emperor, as transmitted via Lay. The Imperial court refused to ratify this, and Osborn resigned in pique on 9November 1863, disbanded the flotilla, and sent the ships back to England without them having fired a shot. Lay was fired that same year by the Chinese government and replaced with Sir Robert Hart. =Later= In 1864, he was appointed to the command of , the first British turret-armed battleship, in order to test the turret system of shipbuilding. In 1865, he became agent to the Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company, and two years later was made managing director of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, a post that he held until 1874. From 1869 he was a Director of the International Mid-Channel Telegraph Co. Ltd. In 1871, he was appointed as captain of in the Channel Fleet. On 12 June 1873, he was appointed rear admiral. His interest in Arctic exploration had never ceased, and in 1873, he induced Commander Albert Hastings Markham to undertake a summer voyage for the purpose of testing the conditions of ice-navigation with the aid of steam. The result of this summer voyage was the British Arctic Expedition, under Sir George Nares. Osborn became a member of the expedition committee.  Death  Osborn died in London on 6 May 1875, a few days after the expedition had sailed. His body was interred at Highgate Cemetery on 10 May 1875 with the funeral attended by many of those who had served with him in the Royal Navy. A cable ship was named for him and the was launched in 1878, for the Eastern Extension, Australasia and China Telegraph Company.

A Traditionalist Catholic and ally of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, he was Bishop of Campos from 1949 until his resignation in 1981. In 1988, he incurred the automatic canonical penalty of excommunication for participating in the illicit consecration of four bishops of the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX). This penalty also applied to Archbishop Lefebvre and the four bishops that they ordained. However a subsequent public declaration of the penalty by the Holy See omitted his name, identifying only Archbishop Lefebvre and the four bishops whom they ordained. This was only one of several inconsistencies in the process. In 2009, Pope Benedict XVI lifted the canonical penalty incurred by the four surviving bishops in the hope of facilitating full reconciliation of the SSPX.Pope lifts excommunications of Lefebvrite bishops Biography Ant√¥nio de Castro Mayer was born in Campinas, S√£o Paulo, to Jo√£o Mayer, a Bavarian stonemason, and his wife, Francisca de Castro, a Brazilian peasant. One of twelve children, Ant√¥nio helped his mother support their family after Jo√£o died in 1910. At age 12, he entered S√£o Paulo's minor seminary, then run by the Premonstratensian Fathers. After entering the major seminary in 1922, he was sent to study at the Pontifical Gregorian University (from where he obtained his doctorate in theology in 1928) in Rome. Mayer was ordained to the priesthood by Basilio Cardinal Pompili on 30 October 1927, and then taught philosophy, history of philosophy, and dogmatic theology at the seminary in S√£o Paulo. Before being named Vicar General of S√£o Paulo in 1942, he became Assistant General of the city's Catholic Action in 1940 and a canon of the cathedral chapter (with the title of First Treasurer) in 1941. He was made a parish priest and the prefect of studies at the Pontifical Catholic University of S√£o Paulo in 1945.

His orthodoxy and his coat, Mayer became known as the \\"Lion of Fields\\". On 6 March 1948, De Castro Mayer was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Campos and Titular Bishop of Priene by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 23 May from Archbishop Carlo Chiarlo, with Bishop Ernesto de Paula and Archbishop Geraldo de Proen√ßa Sigaud, S.V.D., serving as co-consecrators. He succeeded Octaviano de Albuquerque as Bishop of Campos on January 3, 1949, and was very active in combating liberation theology and communist infiltration of the Church and of his diocese. In 1968, the Catholic conservative group Tradition, Family and Property organized a campaign to collect signatures denouncing what were perceived as leftists in the Church. De Castro Mayer lent encouragement to the campaign. Later the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil declared that TFP was neither recognized by the hierarchy nor considered an official Catholic organization.Klaiber, Jeffrey. The Church, Dictatorships, and Democracy in Latin America, Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2009 De Castro Mayer, a staunch traditionalist, refused to implement the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in his diocese. Until his resignation on 29 August 1981, the Tridentine Mass continued throughout the Campos diocese, along with all the other traditional Catholic practices and devotions. He continued this even after resigning as diocesan ordinary and being succeeded by Bishop Carlos Navarro. He was able to maintain a completely traditionalist \\"diocese\\" within a diocese, with around 40,000 faithful, which he organized in parallel chapels. (The diocese itself, without the followers of Bishop Castro Mayer, had some 850,000 Catholics.) This organisation was called the Priestly Society of Saint John Mary Vianney. Under the leadership of his successor, Bishop Lic√≠nio Rangel, this organization was subsequently reconciled to the Catholic Church and reconstituted as the present Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney, with the same territory as the Diocese of Campos, Brazil, by Pope John Paul II in January 2002. On his death bed, Bishop de Castro Mayer refused to sign a so-called \\"formula of reconciliation\\" (which would include an admission that excommunication was really incurred and that no situation of necessity, as claimed by Lefebvre and Castro Mayer, had existed in 1988) proposed by Vatican delegates at his death bed. He died of respiratory failure in Campos on 25 April 1991.

In its simplest form, it can consist of three or four courses; for example: first course, a main course, and dessert. Basics A multicourse meal or full- course dinner is a meal of multiple courses, almost invariably eaten in the evening or afternoon. Most Western-world multicourse meals follow a standard sequence, influenced by traditional French haute cuisine. Each course is supposed to be designed with a particular size and genre that befits its place in the sequence. There are variations depending on location and custom. The following is a common sequence for multicourse meals: # The meal begins with an hors d'oeuvre or appetizer, a small serving that usually does not include red meat. In Italian custom, antipasto is served, usually finger food that does not contain pasta or any starch. # This may be followed by a variety of dishes, including a possible fish course or other light fare. The number and size of these intermittent courses is entirely dependent on local custom. # Following these is the main course. This is the most important course and is usually the largest. # Next comes the salad course, although salad may often refer to a cooked vegetable, rather than the greens most people associate with the word. Note that in America since around 1960, the salad course (usually a small, simple green salad lightly dressed) is served at some point before the main course. Sometimes, the salad also accompanies the cheese course. # The meal may carry on with a cheese selection, accompanied by an appropriate selection of wine. In many countries cheeses will be served before the meal, and in the United States often between the main course and dessert, just like in most European countries. In the UK, more typically the cheese course will follow dessert. Nuts are also a popular after-meal selection (thus the common saying \\"from soup to nuts\\", meaning from beginning to end). # The meal will often culminate with a dessert, either hot or cold, sometimes followed with a final serving of hot or cold fruit and accompanied by a suitable dessert wine. Meals like this are generally very formal as well as very expensive. In formal dining, a full-course dinner can consist of 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 16 courses, and, in its extreme form, has been known to have 21 courses. In these more formalized dining events, the courses are carefully planned to complement each other gastronomically. The courses are smaller and spread out over a long evening, up to three, four or five hours. They follow conventions of menu planning that have been established over many years. Most courses (excluding some light courses such as sorbets) in the most formal full-course dinners are usually paired with a different wine, beer, liqueur, or other spirit. In one modern version of service √† la russe, courses are brought to the table in sequence. Only empty plates are set in front of each guest and guests make selections from a variety of dishes and fill their own plate. In another, common in restaurants, a filled plate is placed in front of a guest, pre- portioned away from the table. Often the meat is pre-portioned, but diners serve themselves with vegetables and side-dishes. In an American formal dining course, typically each course is served sequentially. Guests are served plates already filled with food in individual portions. Often, guests have an opportunity to choose between vegetarian or meat entr√©es. There is no opportunity to request something different or to ask for more than a single serving. Presentation is focused on individual portions In service √† la fran√ßaise, food is served \\"family-style\\", with all courses on the table at the same time. Guests serve themselves so that all dishes are not served at their optimum temperatures. Alternatively, buffet style is a variation of the French service where all food is available at the correct temperature in a serving space other than the dining table. Guests commute to the buffet to be served or sometimes serve themselves and then carry their plates back to the table. Table setting Detailed description. Table settings can be elaborate. More formal settings sometimes include all silverware and glassware that will be needed for the entire meal, and lay out the silverware so that the outermost tools are used for the dishes appearing earliest on the menu. In this scheme, when diners are served the first course, they can depend on finding the correct implement at the outermost edge of the arrangement. A 13 course place setting includes multiple utensils, receptacles, and vessels. The plate is flanked by a caviar spoon, cocktail fork, escargot fork, bouillon spoon, fish fork and knife, lobster pick, bone marrow spoon, entr√©e knife and fork, relev√© knife and fork, salad√© knife and fork. Above the place setting are laid a bread knife (on a knife rest) and plate with personal butter dish, fish bone dish, sorbet spoon, cheese knife, nut pick, and a dessert fork and spoon. To the right of the plate a salt cellar and spoon with pepper is supplied. Glassware includes a water goblet, champagne flute, white wine, red wine, dessert/sherry, and port glasses. An alternative scheme arranges the place setting so that only the implements needed for the first one or two courses appear in the table setting. As the dinner progresses and new courses arrive, used implements are removed with the dishes, and new silverware is placed next to the plates. This scheme is commonly used when dinners are offered √† la carte, so that the most appropriate implement is selected for a given course. For example, some diners may order clear, thin soups and others may order thick, creamy soups. As each of these soups has its own unique spoon, it would be considered improper and impractical to lay out a spoon that may not be needed.

He is considered to be founder of the W√ºrttemberg dynasty. Conrad was the son of a nobleman, von Beutelsbach, and possibly a descendant of the Salic duke Conrad of Carinthia. His brother was Bruno von Beutelsbach (1105‚Äì1120), prior of the Abbey of Hirsau. His wife's name was Werntrud. About 1083 Conrad built a castle on the Wirtemberg close to today's Stuttgart. He made this place his domicile and named himself after it. Under his new name Conrad was a witness some time between 1089-1092 to the so-called Bempflinger Vertrag (treaty) of the counts Kuno and Liutold von Achalm with their nephew count Wernher von Gr√ºningen. On May 5, 1092 in Ulm he witnessed the transfer of property to the Abbey of Allerheiligen near Schaffhausen. This is the first times that his name is mentioned in a complete document, however this document is not an original. In both situations Conrad I. appears closely connected to people who are opponents to Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. This political stance is in agreement with the fact that he asked the Bishop of Worms, an opponent of the Emperor, to consecrate his chapel of the castle, in preference to the Bishop of Constance in whose territory the castle actually was situated. Already earlier, perhaps between 1080 and 1087, Conrad had helped the Abbey of Hirsau with donations as documented in the Hirsauer Schenkungsbuch (\\"Hirsau Abbey Gift Register\\").

Its geometric layout was to prove an early example of modern town planning, later popularised during the Baroque period Baldassarre Lanci (1510‚Äì1571) was an Italian architect, inventor, theatrical set designer, and master of perspective of the Renaissance period. Born in Urbino, he spent most of his working life in Tuscany. Early career He began his career as military engineer, for ten years following 1547 he was in the continual employment of the Republic of Lucca. His notability as a construction engineer earned him the commission to carry out a detailed survey of Rome's city walls and those of the bastions at Ancona, Civitavecchia and Ostia, and for Pope Pius IV Medici architect From 1557 he worked almost exclusively for Cosimo I de' Medici, Lanci's chief employer and patron for whom he supervised such projects as the fortification of Siena and many other Tuscan towns. His urban works included the design of Terra del Sole a fortified new city for Cosimo I de' Medici, in what is now the Province of Forl√¨-Cesena. Lanci also designed the church of Santa Maria della Rosa in the spa town of Chianciano Terme, in today's Province of Siena; Santa Maria della Rosa was built on a central plan; even though it was not finished, the church is notable for the sobriety, and clean lines of its design which culminates in an elegant dome. The church, however, was never fully completed. In 1585 building work stopped, fourteen years after Lanci's death. He also designed the walls of Grosseto in 1564, directing the construction site until his death in 1571, when he was succeeded by his son Marino. Lanci's most notable achievement was his invention in 1567 of a piece of surveying equipment to obtain perspectives with a visual field of 180¬∞. The instrument, which he named distanziometro (\\"distance meter\\"), was made of a circular bronze plate placed upon a horizontal tripod the height of which could be adjusted. Semi-cylindrical paper was wound around its edge. A cylindrical eyepiece was placed in the centre with a retracting metal needle or pen underneath. The eyepiece was high enough to overlook the semicircle of paper and sight points of interest while the retracting needle scored on the paper to accurately plot the subject. It could also be used as a quadrant for measuring height in much the same way as the orizzonte designed by Leon Battista Alberti. His diverse works also included many aquatic projects such as the improvement of Livorno harbour (1566-1567), and the Sovana aqueduct, earning him fame as an early hydraulic engineer. Engineer As an architect his engineering skills were firmly to the forefront, rather than an interpretation on the finer and more sophisticated points of rinascimento architecture. Impregnable fortresses such as the Fortezza Medicea at Siena, and bastide towns, and bridges are his trade mark rather than elegant palazzi. This is not to say Lanci was a man lacking in sophistication, one of his more surprising talents was designing some of the sets for the lavish theatrical and dramatical performances for which the Medici court was famed. As with his architecture, though, it was his engineering skills even here which dominated. Drawing by Lanzi of a perspective view of Florence (Palazzo Vecchio and Brunelleschi's dome of Santa Maria del Fiore) The precise perspective was obtained using the surveying equipment he invented himself. The image itself suggests Lanci's secondary career as a set designer. Long before the Restoration spectaculars of the 17th century Lanci was designing elaborate and complicated theatre sets, using pivoted scenery, with up to three different scenes painted on boards, thus allowing the mood of the production to be altered in an instant. One of the earliest examples of this form of scenic change was recorded in 1568 for a performance of the Fabii produced to celebrate the baptism of a daughter of Francesco de' Medici. One of Lanci's most extravagant productions was for a performance of Giovan Battista Cini's La Vedova (The Widow), staged in Florence in 1569, with amazingly extravagant costumes by Bernardo Buontalenti, the event was recorded by the mathematician Ignazio Danti who was so impressed by Lanci's theatrical engineering he included a drawing of his periactoi stage. The periactoi stage setting was basically a series of three sided revolving triangular boards each side with a different scene. Each triangular board was connected, hence there would be one or two flanking the stage, in the wings, and a further section suspended between them on which would be painted skies, cloudy, sunny, dawn or dusk. The entire series of revolving boards were linked to each other by a series of pulleys and machinery, thus allowing scene changes to be almost instantaneous. While Lanci did not invent this mechanism himself (indeed Vitruvius had described these three-sided units revolving in the Roman era) he was instrumental in its further development. Often producing and relocating the settings of the plays, himself, in order that a greater variety of scenery could be included. What in fact Lanci realised and promoted was that a false perspective coupled with a deliberately created illusionary architectural area, was the perfect dramatical setting.

The first creation came in the Peerage of England 1295 when Robert Hylton was summoned to the Model Parliament as Lord Hylton by writ. His son, Alexander, was called to Parliament in 1332 and 1335, but no further summons were sent for his descendants. Therefore, the title has only been held de jure after the death of the second baron.The Gentlemen's Magazine, March 1821 Indeed, the last baron was Member of Parliament for Carlisle after \\"inheriting\\" the title, due to this anomaly. Despite this, the creation is deemed to have fallen into abeyance on the death of the eighteenth baron without male heirs in 1746. The second creation came in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1866 when the soldier and Conservative politician, Sir William Jolliffe, 1st Baronet, was made Baron Hylton of Hylton, Sunderland in the County Palatine of Durham and of Petersfield in the County of Southampton. He had already been created a Baronet, of Merstham in the County of Surrey, in 1821. He was the grandson of William Jolliffe (for many years Member of Parliament for Petersfield), and a co-heir of the original barony of Hylton through his grandmother Eleanor (the wife of William Jolliffe), daughter of Anne Hylton, sister of the eighteenth Baron of the 1295 creation. Lord Hylton was succeeded by his second son, the second Baron. He notably represented Wells in the House of Commons as a Conservative. His son, the third Baron, also represented Wells in Parliament as a Conservative and after entering the House of Lords notably served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1918 to 1924. His son, the fourth Baron, was Lord Lieutenant of Somerset from 1949 to 1964. the titles are held by the latter's eldest son, the fifth Baron. He is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers who remain in the House of Lords after the House of Lords Act of 1999. Lord Hylton sits as a cross-bencher. The principal seat of the Hylton family was Hylton Castle, Sunderland, with a subsidiary property at Ammerdown House, near Kilmersdon, Somerset.

He was born on 19 December 1893 and was educated at Rugby School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was a civilian prisoner in Germany during World War I. He then went onto pursuing a Fellowship program at Trinity College, Cambridge in October 1919, where he entered into academia as a professional historian. This was interrupted when he accepted an invitation to become the Labour Candidate in Surrey. He later became a tutor at the London School of Economics in 1925. He was promoted to reader and went on to become the Head of the Social Science Department at LSE from 1944 to 1949 and Martin White Professorship of Sociology from 1954 to 1956. Then worked for UNESCO as the head of the Social Science Department from 1956 to 1960,Blyton, P. (1982). T.H. Marshall 1893‚Äì1981. International Social Science Journal. Vol. 91(1), pp. 157‚Äì8. possibly contributing to the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which was drafted in 1954, but not ratified until 1966. He was the fourth president of the International Sociological Association (1959‚Äì1962).  Biography  T.H. Marshall was born in London on 19 December 1893 to a wealthy, artistically cultured family (a Bloomsbury family). He was one of six children. Because of his wealthy background, he attended Rugby School, a preparatory boarding school. He continued his schooling at Trinity College, Cambridge where he studied History.  Philosophy of social science  Modern political science pioneer Seymour Martin Lipset argues that Marshall proposed a model of social science based on the Middle Range Theory of social structures and institutions, as opposed to grand theories of the purposes of development and modernisation, which were criticised by modern sociologists such as Robert K. Merton for being too speculative to provide valid results.Lipset, S.M. (1965). \\"Introduction.\\" In T.H. Marshall (Ed.). Class, Citizenship, and Social Development. 2nd ed. Garden City, NY: Anchor Books. pp. xvii‚Äìxviii. By using such a middle range approach, Marshall and his mentor L. T. Hobhouse believed that rigid class distinctions could be dissolved and middle class citizenship generalised through a careful understanding of social mechanisms. He also believed this would allow sociology to become an international discipline, helping \\"to increase mutual understanding between cultures\\" and further international co-operation.Marshall, T.H. (1959). \\"International Comprehension in Social Science.\\" In T.H. Marshall (Ed.)(1965). Class, Citizenship, and Social Development. 2nd ed. Garden City, New York: Anchor Books. pp. 47‚Äì8. While employing some concepts from Marxist conflict theory, such as social class and revolution, Marshall's analyses are based on functionalist concerns with phenomena such as \\"consensus, the normal, and anomie; co-operation and conflict; structure and growth,\\" within self- contained systems.Marshall, T.H. (1960). \\"Sociology ‚Äì The Road Ahead.\\" In T.H. Marshall (Ed.)(1965). Class, Citizenship, and Social Development. 2nd ed. Garden City, New York: Anchor Books. p. 33. Rather than studying \\"society,\\" which may include non-systemic elements, Marshall argues that the task of sociology is: > the analytical and explanatory study of social systems....a set of > interrelated and reciprocal activities having the following characteristics. > The activities are repetitive and predictable to the degree necessary, > first, to permit of purposeful, peaceful and orderly behaviour of the > members of the society, and secondly to enable the pattern of action to > continue in being, that is to say to preserve its identity even while > gradually changing its shape.Marshall, 1960, p. 28. Whereas Marxists point to the internal contradictions of capital accumulation and class inequality (intra-systemic), Marshall sees phenomena that are anti- systemic as partly \\"alien\\" to the social system.Marshall, 1960, p. 33. Ideas = Citizenship = T. H. Marshall wrote a seminal essay on citizenship--which became his most famous work--titled \\"Citizenship and Social Class\\". This was published in 1950, based on a lecture given the previous year. He analysed the development of citizenship as a development of civil, then political, then social rights. With the civil rights being the first to be established, this included free speech, free religion, property ownership, and equal access to the legal system. Political rights followed by the right to vote and democracy. Lastly, social rights came with positive freedoms such as welfare rights. Social rights happened because the arrival of the modern welfare state. These were broadly assigned to the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries respectively because of the \\"arrival of comprehensive civil rights\\" in the eighteenth century and the arrival of political rights in the nineteenth century. Social Rights are awarded not on the basis of class or need, but rather on the status of citizenship. He claimed that the extension of social rights does not entail the destruction of social classes and inequality. T. H. Marshall was a close friend and admirer of Leonard Hobhouse, and his conception of citizenship emerged from a series of lectures given by Hobhouse at the LSE. Hobhouse is more philosophical, whereas Marshall is under the influence of measures taken by Lord Beveridge after World War II. All of these people were involved in a turn in liberal thought that was called \\"new liberalism\\", a liberalism with a social conscience. T. H. Marshall also talks about industrial citizenship and its relationship with citizenship. He said that social rights are a precursor for political and civil rights. = Criticisms = Marshall's analysis of citizenship has been criticised on the basis that it only applies to males in England (Note: England rather than Britain).Nancy Fraser and Linda Gordon, \\"Contract versus Charity: Why is there no social citizenship in the United States?\\" Socialist Review vol. 23, no. 3 (July/September 1992) Marxist critics point out that Marshall's analysis is superficial as it does not discuss the right of the citizen to control economic production, which they argue is necessary for sustained shared prosperity. From a feminist perspective, the work of Marshall is highly constricted in being focused on men and ignoring the social rights of women and impediments to their realisation.Bryan S. Turner 1993 \\"Citizenship and Social Theory\\" p. 3-4 There is a debate among scholars about whether Marshall intended his historical analysis to be interpreted as a general theory of citizenship or whether the essay was just a commentary on developments within England.Bulmer, M. and Rees, A. M. (1996) \\"Conclusion: citizenship in the twenty-first century‚Äù in Bulmer, M. and A. M. Rees (eds.) Citizenship today : the contemporary relevance of T.H. Marshall, UCL Press: London. p. 270. The essay has been used by editors to promote more equality in society, including the \\"Black\\" vote in the USA, and against Mrs. Thatcher in a 1992 edition prefaced by Tom Bottomore. It is an Anglo-Saxon interpretation of the evolution of rights in a \\"peaceful reform\\" mode, unlike the revolutionary interpretations of Charles Tilly, the other great theoretician of citizenship in the twentieth century, who bases his readings in the developments of the French Revolution.

He reached the final of the 2000 Toronto Masters and achieved a career-high singles ranking of World No. 30 (June 2001), with his best doubles ranking being World No. 71 in May 2008. Levy was a key factor in Israel's semifinal run in the 2009 Davis Cup. In a career interrupted first by Israeli Army service and later by serious right hip surgery in 2001, Levy notably scored victories over Pete Sampras, Andy Roddick, Michael Chang and Wayne Ferreira. As well as reaching the singles final of the 2000 Toronto Masters, he finished runner-up at Nottingham in 2001 and won a doubles title in Newport, Rhode Island. In September 2017, Levy was named the captain of Israel‚Äôs Davis Cup team. Early and personal life Levy was born in Nahshonim, Israel, and is Jewish. Levy, Noam Okun, and Dudi Sela were Israel's top singles players a number of years, and were among a number of Jewish professional tennis players. Levi, Joshua, \\"Israeli star trains at Maccabi courts,\\" The Australian Jewish News,\\" 1/10/08, accessed 6/4/09 Told that younger Jewish players look up to him, Levy said: \\"It's nice to hear that. I want to represent Israel and the Jewish people the best I can. I play for myself first. But then whatever my play can do for the Jewish community is great ‚Äî just great.\\" Levy is a good friend of Brazilian tennis champion Gustavo Kuerten, with whom Levy has often been a hitting partner. Levy is a fan of the soccer team Maccabi Haifa. Tennis career Levy began playing tennis at age seven. His family moved to Portugal for a year and half when he was nine years old. They returned to Israel, and in 1992 the family moved to Ramat Hasharon so he could train at the Israel Tennis Centers there. That year, he was # 1 in the under-14 age group in Israel. =1995‚Äì99= After turning pro in 1995, Levy served his required time in the Israeli military, but the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) allowed him to compete in events during his service. In March 1998 he and Lior Mor won in Israel, defeating Barry Cowan and Filippo Veglio 6‚Äì4, 7‚Äì6 in the final. In June he and partner Raviv Weidenfeld won in Ireland, defeating Daniele Braccoalo and Igor Gaudi 7‚Äì6, 6‚Äì4 in the final. In July he and Mor won in Greece, defeating Gilles Elseneer and Wim Neefs 6‚Äì3, 0‚Äì6, 6‚Äì3 in the final. In July 1999 while ranked # 241 he beat Michael Chang, formerly ranked # 2 in the world, 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì3, at the Safeway Challenger in Aptos, California. In August 1999 at Indianapolis he defeated world # 40 Ji≈ô√≠ Nov√°k, 7‚Äì5, 6‚Äì1. In September he and partner Noam Okun won at Budapest, defeating Daniel Fiala and Leo≈° Friedl 6‚Äì4, 4‚Äì6, 6‚Äì2 in the final. =2000‚Äì04= Harel Levy at the 2004 U.S. Open In January 2000 he and partner Jonathan Erlich won at Orlando, Florida, defeating √ìscar Ortiz and Jimy Szymanski 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì4 in the final. In July they won at Newport, Rhode Island, defeating Kyle Spencer and Mitch Sprengelmeyer 7‚Äì6(2), 7‚Äì5 in the final of the Hall of Fame tennis championship. In July 2000 at the Tennis Masters Series-Canada tournament in Toronto, while ranked only 144th in the world, he used whiplike ground strokes, a tantalizing drop shot, and winners off his one-handed to beat world # 73 Martin Damm, # 47 Stefan Koubek, # 27 S√©bastien Grosjean, # 61 J√©r√¥me Golmard, and # 55 Ji≈ô√≠ Nov√°k, before losing in the finals to # 9 Marat Safin. Levy more than doubled his career earnings with the $211,000 runner-up prize. Levy was the first Israeli to reach an ATP Tour final since Amos Mansdorf in 1994, and jumped to # 70 in the world rankings. Levy completed his three years of military service in the IDF in August 2000. In March 2001 he upset world # 10 Tim Henman of Great Britain 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì4 at Scottsdale. In May 2001 Levy upset the world's top player, Pete Sampras, at the Italian Open, 7‚Äì5, 2‚Äì6, 6‚Äì4, saving 13 of 17 break points. In his next match at the tournament, he beat world # 33 Francisco Clavet 6‚Äì4, 7‚Äì6(6), and then whipped Nicolas Kiefer, 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì4, winning 80% of his first serves. Levy played down his achievements by joking that he was more depressed by his Israeli soccer team (Maccabi Haifa) losing that week than excited by his success. \\"I still like soccer much more than tennis\\", he shrugged. In the quarterfinals he subsequently lost to Sweden's Andreas Vinciguerra. In June 2001 Levy upset world # 17 Wayne Ferreira of South Africa 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì4. He then beat world # 40 Andy Roddick 7‚Äì6(3), 5‚Äì7, 6‚Äì3 with powerful groundstrokes and spinning drop shots, while sustaining a right hip injury. At one point, Roddick prostrated himself on the court, worshiping with outstretched arms in Levy's direction after Levy had gone up 40‚Äì0 on Roddick's serve on three cross-court passes. \\"He'd produced three running passing shots in a row\\", Roddick explained. \\"My approach play hadn't been bad. He just came up with power and speed and there was nothing I could do about it at all.\\" Levy lost in the finals of the Nottingham Tournament in England to Thomas Johansson of Sweden, 7‚Äì5, 6‚Äì3, despite his use of what had become by then his trademark drop volleys. In late June he retired from his first round Wimbledon match with a hip injury. On June 25, at the age of 22, he reached the ranking of # 30 in the world. In November 2001 Levy flew to the US for arthroscopic surgery for an injured knee, and also had complicated right hip surgery to address his injury in Nottingham. He spent six months home in Ramat Ha-Sharon, a suburb of Tel Aviv, recuperating, and in April 2002 returned to playing tennis. Levy was hampered by injuries for much of the 2002 season. By July 2002, his ranking had dropped to 326. The following month he said: \\"I'm not going to be back to a hundred percent, but if I get back to 90%, I'll be very happy.\\" At the US Open in 2002 he defeated world # 30 Andrei Pavel 1‚Äì6, 7‚Äì6(7), 4‚Äì6, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì4. A partisan crowd cheered him on. Asked how much the crowd helped him, Levy shrugged: \\"In percentages, you want? OK, around 23¬Ω.\\" At the Forest Hills Tennis Classic in May 2003, Levy defeated top-seeded world # 96 Justin Gimelstob 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì3. At the qualifying tournament for Wimbledon in 2003, Levy defeated Paul Goldstein in the first round, and reached the 3rd round before losing. In September 2003, Levy and partner Paul Baccanello of Australia won the doubles title at the Open de l'Is√®re, defeating Rik de Voest and Johan Landsberg 5‚Äì7, 6‚Äì4, 7‚Äì6(5) in Grenoble, France. Levy also reached the singles final at the tournament. Later that month he paired with Amir Hadad to defeat Fred Hemmes, Jr and Raemon Sluiter 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì4 to win in Groningen, the Netherlands. In October he and Hadad defeated Scott Humphries and Mark Merklein 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì7(3), 6‚Äì3 to win in Nottingham, England. Levy was back in peak form at the Dnepropetrovsk tournament in November 2003. He reached the singles final before succumbing to Georgian Irakli Labadze 3‚Äì6, 6‚Äì3, 1‚Äì6. Levy fared better in the doubles tournament where, along with partner Jonathan Erlich he won the title in straight sets, 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì3, over Simon Aspelin and Johan Landsberg. He and Erlich also won that month at Bratislava, Slovakia, defeating Mario Anƒçiƒá and Martin Garc√≠a 7‚Äì6(7), 6‚Äì3 in the final. He finished 2003 ranked 111th in the world in singles. =2005‚Äìpresent= The doubles performances of Levy and his partner Amir Hadad in the months of April and May, 2005, were impressive. In late April the Israelis captured the Hungary F1 tournament in Budapest, defeating Nikola Martinoviƒá and Josko Topic 5‚Äì7, 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì1 in the final. A few days later they won the F2 title in Miskolc as well, beating Bastian Knittel and Marius Zay 6‚Äì1, 6‚Äì0 in the final. Levy and Hadad then competed in May in the German town of Furth, where they took the title from Jan Frode Andersen and Johan Landsberg, 6‚Äì1, 6‚Äì2. In July they won at Budaors, Hungary, defeating Adam Chadaj and St√©phane Robert 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì7(7), 6‚Äì3. In 2005 Levy won the USTA Tulsa Challenger, beating Benedikt Dorsch of Germany, the reigning NCAA men's singles champion, in a three-hour duel 5‚Äì7, 7‚Äì5, 7‚Äì6(6).https://www.missourivalley.usta.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=248852&itype;=1268 In September 2005 he and partner Noam Okun won in Istanbul, Turkey, defeating David ≈†koch and Martin ≈†tƒõp√°nek in the final, 6‚Äì4, 7‚Äì5. In January 2006, a right shoulder injury forced him to retire from a Sydney ATP singles match, and sidelined him for a week. In June 2006 he and Giorgio Galimberti won in Milan, Italy, defeating Frederico Gil and Juan Albert Viloca in the final, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì3. In August he and partner Sam Warburg won in the Bronx, New York, defeating Scott Lipsky and David Martin in the Bronx Classic final, 6‚Äì4, 7‚Äì5. Levy at 2008 Israel Tennis Championship In early 2007 Levy was suspended from all competition for three months by the Israel Tennis Federation for failing to participate in a State Cup tennis match that the ITF had organized. In April 2007 he and Warburg won at Valencia, California, defeating Cecil Mamiit and Eric Taino in the final, 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì4. In June they won at Yuba City, California, defeating Eric Nu√±ez and Jean-Julien Rojer in the final, 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì4. In July 2007 Levy and Rajeev Ram competed together in doubles at Wimbledon, where they made it through the qualifying rounds and to the quarterfinals ‚Äì Levy's best grand slam showing to date. On their way they defeated 15th-seeded Mart√≠n Garc√≠a and Sebasti√°n Prieto 7‚Äì6(0), 6‚Äì7(4), 7‚Äì6(4), 6‚Äì7(3), 10‚Äì8 in the third round. They lost in the quarters to No. 10 seeds Arnaud Cl√©ment and Micha√´l Llodra, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì2. Later in July, Levy, who had slipped to 264 in the world rankings since his surgery, won a challenger title in Manchester, Great Britain, beating Travis Rettenmaier 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì4 in the final. In the men's final of the Israeli Championship in December 2007 Levy, who had won the title in 1997, 1999, and 2002, defeated Dekel Valtzer, 6‚Äì0, 6‚Äì1. By December, Levy had risen 125 places in 2007. His coach, Oded Jacob, said: \\"Levy suffered a very serious injury in 2001 from which some players have never managed to recover. He went through some very difficult years of physical and mental recuperation. I think he's recovered from that now, and I feel he's learned to come to terms with the fact that he's no longer No. 30 in the world. His goal now is to return to the top 100.\\" In December 2008 Levy claimed the fifth Israeli championship title of his career, beating Dudi Sela 6‚Äì4, 3‚Äì6, 7‚Äì5. \\"I won the match because I always believed I would\\", said Levy. In doubles Levy and Noam Okun lost in the finals to Andy Ram and Noam Behr, 6‚Äì1, 6‚Äì4. Levy decided at the beginning of 2009 to enter slowly reduce his participation in singles tournaments, and put an emphasis on his doubles career with Noam Okun. But after his Davis Cup win in Sweden, he changed his plans. To prepare for the tie with Russia, he realized he had to once again stress his singles career, and while he kept playing doubles, he played singles anywhere possible. =Davis Cup= Levy Playing Davis Cup Levy played for Israel's Davis Cup team starting in 1998, with a 22‚Äì15 record through July 2009. In 2008 he played in a tie against Sweden, in which he was not victorious in the final and deciding match. However, he redeemed Israel and himself in 2009 against Sweden. In September 2008 against the Peru Davis Cup team, after losing one match in singles to Luis Horna 7‚Äì5, 5‚Äì7, 7‚Äì6(3), 6‚Äì3, Levy paired with Andy Ram to win the doubles tie 6‚Äì1, 6‚Äì1, 6‚Äì2, as Israel won 4‚Äì1. In the 2009 World Group Playoffs in March 2009, Israel again faced Sweden. 2002 Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson defeated Levy in the opening match, 6‚Äì7(3), 6‚Äì4, 7‚Äì5, 4‚Äì6, 8‚Äì6, in just under 4 hours, but Levy won the decisive final match against Andreas Vinciguerra in Vinciguerra's hometown of Malm√∂, Sweden, 6‚Äì4, 4‚Äì6, 6‚Äì4, 3‚Äì6, 8‚Äì6 in a marathon 3 hour, 44 minutes to lead the Israeli team to a come-from-behind 3‚Äì2 victory over the 7-time Davis Cup champion Swedes at Baltic Hall, allowing Israel to advance in the 2009 Davis Cup. In their 84-year Davis Cup history, the Swedes had never before lost a tie after holding a 2‚Äì1 lead. \\"I had a coach who always told me that I'm a winner, and that I will always be one. The press labeled me as a loser when I wasn't doing well, and now they say I'm a winner. I know my worth, and I proved to myself that I can still win big matches\\", Levy said. He added: \\"Despite all the difficult years, scouring the globe to play in small tournaments with little success, I'm now experiencing a joy that has made it all worthwhile.\\" Israel (ranked 8th in the Davis Cup standings, with 5,394 points) hosted heavily favored Russia (which won in both 2002 and 2006, and was the top-ranked country in Davis Cup standings, with 27,897 points) in a Davis Cup quarterfinal tie in July 2009, on indoor hard courts at the Nokia Arena in Tel Aviv.\\"Israel drops Russia 2‚Äì0 in Davis Cup,\\" Russia Today, 7/10/09, accessed 7/11/09 Israel was represented by Levy, Dudi Sela, Jonathan Erlich, and Andy Ram. Russia's lineup consisted of Marat Safin (# 24 in the world; former world # 1), Igor Andreev (26), Igor Kunitsyn (35), and Mikhail Youzhny (44; former world # 8).Sinai, Allon, \\"Int'l Tennis: Ram, Erlich expect the spark to return for Davis Cup tie,\\" The Jerusalem Post, 7/3/09, accessed 7/3/09 \\"I believe we can do it against Russia\\", predicted Levy. The stage was set by Safin, who prior to the tie told the press: \\"With all due respect, Israel was lucky to get to the quarterfinals.\\" The Israeli team's response was to beat the Russian team in each of their first three matches, thereby winning the tie. Levy was aware that the Russians thought he was incapable of playing at their level, let alone beating Russia's top player, Andreev. Levy, ranked what the Russian press referred to as a \\"lowly\\" world # 210, beat Andreev, world # 24, 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì2, 4‚Äì6, 6‚Äì2 in the opening match. Levy said: \\"I had a feeling Andreev couldn't hurt me in any way, while I could do almost anything, and that made me very calm. I forced him to feel very uncomfortable on the court, lowering his confidence, and his game became more simple.\\" Sela (# 33) followed by beating Russian Youzhny 3‚Äì6, 6‚Äì1, 6‚Äì0, 7‚Äì5. Israeli captain Eyal Ran likened his players to two fighter jets on court, saying: \\"I felt as if I had two F-16s out there today, they played amazingly well.\\" The 10,500 spectators were the largest crowd ever for a tennis match in Israel. The next day Israelis Ram and Erlich beat Safin and Kunitsyn 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì7(3), 4‚Äì6, 6‚Äì4 in front of a boisterous crowd of over 10,000. Ran was carried shoulder-high around the Tel Aviv stadium, as the 10,000-strong crowd applauded. With the tie clinched for Israel, the reverse singles rubbers were \\"dead\\", and instead of best-of-five matches, best-of-three sets were played, with the outcomes of little to no importance. Israel wrapped up a 4‚Äì1 victory over Russia, as Levy defeated Kunitsyn 6‚Äì4, 4‚Äì6, 7‚Äì6(2), while Sela retired with a wrist injury while down 3‚Äì4 in the first set against Andreev.\\"Israel completes Davis Cup win over Russia,\\" Miami Herald, 7/12/09/accessed 7/12/09 Israel next faced the Spanish Davis Cup team in Spain, in Israel's first appearance in the Davis Cup semifinals. Captain of Israel Davis Cup Team In September 2017, Levy was named the captain of Israel‚Äôs Davis Cup team, taking over from Eyal Ran.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba on three occasions: from 1897 to 1899, from 1907 to 1910, and from 1914 to 1915. Lauzon was a member of the Conservative Party. Lauzon was born on March 15, 1858, in Pointe-Claire, Canada East (now Quebec). He was educated at Pointe Claire College, and moved to Manitoba to work as a cattle dealer. He first sought election to the Manitoba legislature in the 1896 provincial election and lost to Liberal candidate James Prendergast in the constituency of St. Boniface, 357 votes to 278. Prendergast resigned shortly after the election, and Lauzon was elected to take his place in the legislature in a by-election held on February 7, 1897. He defeated Liberal candidate S.A.D. Bertrand by 388 votes to 208, and sat with the Conservative caucus on the opposition benches of the legislature. The Conservatives won a majority government in the 1899 provincial election, though Lauzon lost his St. Boniface constituency to S.A.D. Bertrand by twenty-five votes. He attempted to return to the legislature in the 1903 campaign for the rural constituency of La V√©rendrye, but lost to Liberal incumbent William Lagimodi√®re by a margin of only eleven votes. Lauzon was re-elected in the 1907 provincial election, defeating Lagimodi√®re by twenty-three votes. He served as a backbench supporter of Rodmond Roblin's government for the next three years, and lost to Liberal candidate William Molloy by nine votes in the 1910 campaign. Lauzon was elected to the legislature for a third time in the 1914 provincial election, defeating Liberal candidate Philippe Adjutor Talbot by 228 votes. He again served as a backbench supporter of Roblin's government. In 1915, Roblin's administration was forced to resign after a commission established by the Lieutenant Governor found the government guilty of corruption in the tendering of legislative contracts. A new election was called, which the Liberals won in a landslide. Lauzon lost the La V√©rendrye constituency to Talbot by 155 votes.

Early life and career Born in Besan√ßon, as the son of a lawyer, he was intended to follow his father's profession, but the events of 1789 turned his mind in another direction. Joining the battalion of Besan√ßon, he took part in the political events of that year, and in 1791 went to the French Revolutionary Army of the Upper Rhine with a volunteer battalion. He took part in the campaign of 1792 and was one of the stormers at Hochheim (1793). From the Count of Custine's staff he was transferred to that of Jean Baptiste Kl√©ber, with whom he took part in the Sambre and Rhine Campaigns (1794‚Äì96). After serving with Louis Lazare Hoche and Andr√© Mass√©na in Germany and Switzerland (1797‚Äì99), Pajol took a cavalry command under Jean Victor Marie Moreau for the campaign on the upper Rhine. First Empire In the short years of peace Pajol, now colonel, was successively envoy to the Batavian Republic, and delegate at Napoleon I's coronation (the start of the First French Empire). In 1805, the emperor employed him with the light cavalry. He distinguished himself at the battle of Austerlitz, and, after serving for a short time in the Italian Peninsula, he rejoined the Grande Arm√©e as a general of brigade, in time to take part in the campaign of Friedland. The next year (1808) he was made a Baron d‚ÄôEmpire. In 1809 he served on the Danube, and in the Russian War of 1812 led a division, and afterwards a corps, of cavalry. He survived retreat, but his health was so broken that he retired to his native town of Besan√ßon for a time. He was back again in active service, however, in time to be present at the battle of Dresden, in which he played a conspicuous part. Again wounded in the battle of Leipzig, Pajol was created a count of the Empire on 25 November 1813. In 1814 he fought in the Six Days Campaign, commanding a corps of all arms in the Seine Valley. On the fall of Napoleon, Pajol gave in his adhesion to the Restoration government, but he rejoined the Emperor immediately upon his return to France. The 1st Cavalry Corps (1er corps de cavalerie) under his leadership played a prominent part in the campaign of 1815, both at Ligny and in the advance on Wavre under the Marquis de Grouchy. On receiving the news of the battle of Waterloo, Pajol disengaged his command, and skillfully retreated to refuge in Paris. There he and his men played an active part in the actions which ended the war. Later life The Bourbons, on their return, dismissed him, although this treatment was not, compared to that applied to Michel Ney and others, excessively harsh. In 1830 he took part in the July Revolution and the overthrow of Charles X. He suppressed the riots in Paris in 1831 and 1832, 1834 and 1839. A general, and a peer of France, he was put on the retired list in 1842 and died two years later. Family His son, Count Charles Paul Victor Pajol (1821‚Äì1891), entered the army and had reached the rank of g√©n√©ral de division when, during the Franco-Prussian War, he was involved in the catastrophe of Metz (1870). He retired in 1877. Besides being judged a competent soldier, he was a sculptor of some merit, who executed statues of his father and of Napoleon, and he wrote a life of his father and a history of the wars under Louis XV (Paris 1881‚Äì1891).

Biography. Allmusic, 2011] He was raised in Havana with the singer Graciela, his foster sister. In New York City, Machito formed the band the Afro-Cubans in 1940, and with Mario Bauz√° as musical director, brought together Cuban rhythms and big band arrangements in one group. He made numerous recordings from the 1940s to the 1980s, many with Graciela as singer. Machito changed to a smaller ensemble format in 1975, touring Europe extensively. He brought his son and daughter into the band, and received a Grammy Award in 1983, one year before he died. Machito's music had an effect on the lives of many musicians who played in the Afro-Cubans over the years, and on those who were attracted to Latin jazz after hearing him. George Shearing, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and Stan Kenton credited Machito as an influence. An intersection in East Harlem is named \\"Machito Square\\" in his honor. Early life Machito gave conflicting accounts of his birth. He sometimes said he was a native Cuban from Havana. Other accounts place his birth in Tampa, Florida, making him an American of Cuban ancestry. He may have been born in 1908 in the Jes√∫s Mar√≠a district of Havana or in Tampa, 1909 in the Marianao Beach district of Havana or in Tampa, 1912 in Tampa or Havana, or even 1915 in Havana. Regardless of his place of birth, Machito was raised from an early age in the Jes√∫s Mar√≠a district of Havana, where his foster sister Graciela was born August 23, 1915. Her parents raised both of them. Young Francisco Ra√∫l Guti√©rrez Grillo, the son of a cigar manufacturer, was nicknamed \\"Macho\\" as a child because he was the first son born to his parents after they had three daughters. In his teens and twenties in Cuba, \\"Macho\\" became a professional musician, playing in several ensembles from 1928 to 1937. Career \\"Macho\\" moved to New York City in 1937 as a vocalist with \\"Las Estrellas Habaneras\\" (Havana Stars).Medina, Luis; 1984; \\"Machito,\\" Avance Magazine; pg. 15 He worked with several Latin artists and orchestras in the late 1930s, recording with Conjunto Moderno, Cuarteto Caney, Orchestra Siboney, and the bandleader Xavier Cugat. After an earlier attempt to launch a band with Mario Bauz√°, in 1940 he founded the Afro-Cubans, and conducted their first rehearsal on December 3 at the Park Palace BallroomSalazar, Max; 2002; \\"Mambo Kingdom: Latin Music in New York;\\" pg. 9 located at W. 110th Street in Harlem.The Christian, Volume 98, Issue 26; 1960; pg. 12Allen, Ray; 2019; \\"Jump Up!: Caribbean Carnival Music in New York;\\" pg. 5 9 A big band-style brass section with trumpets and saxes was backed by a trap drum, piano, bass and a Cuban bongo.Leymarie, Isabelle; 1997; \\"Cuban Fire: The Story of Salsa and Latin Jazz;\\" pg. 159 Several weeks later, in early January 1941, Machito took on Bauza as musical director;Interviews Cited Bauz√°, Mario. Interview by John Storm Roberts, Jazz Oral History Project, Smithsonian Institution. 13 December 1978. a role he kept for 34 years. Bauza also played trumpet and alto saxophone. The band had an early hit with \\"Sopa de Pichon\\" in 1941. Its title is slang for \\"pigeon soup\\", a Puerto Rican joke about nearly starving as an immigrant in New York. Machito and the Afro- Cubans, were among the first to fuse Afro-Cuban rhythms with jazz improvisation and big band arrangements. Machito was the front man and maraca player of the Afro Cubans, while Bauza determined the character of the band as musical director.Yanow, Scott; 2001; \\"The Trumpet Kings: The Players who Shaped the Sound of Jazz Trumpet;\\" pg. 43 Bauza, Machito's brother-in-law from his marriage to Machito's sister Estela, hired jazz-oriented arrangers and musicians to replace the band's founding member and original arranger, Joseph \\"Pin\\" Madera, who had been drafted into the U.S. Military and served in World War II.Salazar, Max; 2002; \\"Mambo Kingdom: Latin Music in New York;\\" pg. 11 As a result, Machito's music greatly inspired such North American jazz giants as Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and Stan Kenton. One of the most famous performances of the Kenton band is an idiomatic Afro-Cuban number known as \\"Machito,\\" composed by Stan Kenton with Pete Rugolo and released as a Capitol 78 in 1947. Machito and Graciela in 1947 In April 1943 during World War II, Machito was drafted into the United States Army. After a few months of training, he suffered a leg injury and was discharged in October. Earlier, anticipating a long absence of the band's leader, Bauza had sent for Machito's younger foster sister Graciela, who traveled to New York from Havana where she had been touring with El Trio Garcia, and singing lead with the all-female Orquesta Anacaona. Graciela served as the lead singer of the Afro-Cubans for a year before Machito returned to front the band. Graciela stayed on‚Äîat performances, the two singers alternated solo songs and created duets such as \\"Si Si No No\\" and \\"La Paella\\". Adding to the percussion, Graciela played claves alongside Machito's maracas. Beginning in 1947, teenager Willie Bobo helped move the band's gear to gigs in Upper Manhattan, just so he could watch them play. Near the end of the evening, if there were no musician's union leaders in sight (he was underage), he borrowed bongos from Jos√© Mangual and played with the band. Later, Machito helped him get positions in other Latin bands. Many years later, George Shearing pointed to Machito and Willie Bobo as two musicians who helped him learn \\"what Latin music was about\\". Machito accepted a recording date with Stan Kenton's band in December 1947, playing maracas on the tune \\"The Peanut Vendor\\", which turned out to be a great hit for Kenton. Other Afro-Cubans at the date were Carlos Vidal on congas and Jos√© Mangual on timbales. The next month, the bands of both Kenton and Machito shared the stage at The Town Hall, setting off a surging interest in Cubop. Machito named that style of music when he recorded an arrangement of Bauza's \\"Tanga\\" with the new title \\"Cubop City\\" in 1948. Machito was sought after by record producers, and in his live shows he featured soloists Howard McGhee on trumpet and Brew Moore on tenor sax. Late in 1948 he took to the studio with Charlie Parker, and Flip Phillips on tenor sax. Machito's star was ascendant, and he played Carnegie Hall on February 11, 1949, on a bill including Duke Ellington, Lester Young, Bud Powell and Coleman Hawkins. An album made from 1948 and 1949 recordings was issued: Mucho Macho. For these recordings, the 14-piece band had three trumpeters (including Bauza), four saxophonists, piano player Ren√© Hern√°ndez, a bass player, and three percussionists playing bongos, congas and timbales, augmented by Graciela on claves and Machito himself on maracas. A subsequent release was Tremendo Cumban featuring arrangements by pianist Hern√°ndez and vocal additions from the Rugual Brothers. This recording includes Mitch Miller playing oboe on one tune, \\"Oboe Mambo\\". Each summer from the mid-1940s to the late 1960s, a period of 22 years, Machito and his band played a ten-week engagement at the Concord Resort Hotel in the Catskills. Machito's album Vacation at the Concord was issued in 1958 as a representative experience of an evening's performance, but it was not recorded at the resort. Five-year-old Mario Grillo learned to play the timbales during the 1961 summer series, with lessons from Uba Nieto, then returned to New York with his father's band and played his first gig, taking a single timbales solo at the Palladium Ballroom while standing on a chair next to Tito Puente. In 1957, Machito recorded the album Kenya, with mostly original songs by A.K. Salim, or Hern√°ndez collaborating with Bauza. The only cover tune was \\"Tin Tin Deo\\" by Chano Pozo. Guest musicians include Doc Cheatham and Joe Newman on trumpet, Cannonball Adderley on alto sax, and Eddie Bert on trombone. Band regular and arranger band Ray Santos played tenor sax on the album as well. A seven-man percussion section (including Candido Camero and Carlos \\"Patato\\" Valdes) rounds it out. The album has shown significant longevity: a half century after its release it was named by Robert Dimery in his book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. =Smaller format= In 1975, Machito's son Mario Grillo, known as \\"Machito Jr\\", joined the band for its recording with Dizzy Gillespie, Afro-Cuban Jazz Moods; the album, featuring arrangements by Chico O'Farrill, was nominated for a Grammy Award. Later in 1975, Machito determined that he would accept an invitation to tour Europe with a smaller eight-piece ensemble. Bauza quit; he had grave doubts that such an enterprise would work musically. Graciela left as well. The tour and the smaller band proved very successful; the start of perennial tours of Europe. (Bauza admitted, years later, that he had acted too hastily.) Mario Grillo took over the duties of musical director in 1977. That year, the band earned another Grammy nomination for Fireworks‚Äîa change of tone signaled by the appearance of Lalo Rodr√≠guez as co-lead singer and composer of three tunes. Further European tours were undertaken using the band name \\"Machito and his Salsa Big Band\\", and Machito's daughter Paula Grillo carried female lead vocals, stepping into Graciela's shoes. When the band appeared in London in February 1982, they accepted long-term engagements, making London their \\"home base\\". At Avery Fisher Hall in 1978, Machito and his band played for the New York portion of the Newport Jazz Festival. Dizzy Gillespie soloed with the band. Following his set, Machito and Tito Puente both brought their bands to the stage. The two bands played the song \\"Mamba Adonis\\" for 15 minutes, a tune that was later renamed \\"Machito Forever\\" by Puente. Subsequently, Machito's band and Gillespie finished the set with the tune \\"Manteca\\", an arrangement from 1948. In 1983, Machito won a Grammy Award in the Best Latin Recording category for Machito & His Salsa Big Band '82. The recording was made in the Netherlands in about four hours, mostly one take per tune. Notable innovations =Creation of Latin jazz= The first jazz song to be overtly based in-clave was \\"Tanga\\" (1942) composed by Mario Bauza and recorded by Machito and his Afro-Cubans. > The first descarga [Cuban jam session] that made the world take notice is > traced to a Machito rehearsal on May 29, 1943, at the Park Palace Ballroom, > at 110th Street and 5th Avenue. At this time, Machito was at Fort Dix (New > Jersey) in his fourth week of basic training. The day before at La Conga > Club, Mario Bauza, Machito's trumpeter and music director, heard pianist > Luis Varona and bassist Julio Andino play something which would serve as a > permanent sign off (end the dance) tune. On this Monday evening, Dr. Bauza > leaned over the piano and instructed Varona to play the same piano vamp he > did the night before. Varona's left hand began the introduction of Gilberto > Valdes' El Botellero. Bauza then instructed Julio Andino what to play; then > the saxes; then the trumpets. The broken chord sounds soon began to take > shape into an Afro-Cuban jazzed up melody. Gene Johnson's alto sax then > emitted oriental-like jazz phrases. By accident, Afro-Cuban jazz was > invented when Bauza composed \\"Tanga\\" (African word for marijuana) that > evening. Thereafter, whenever \\"Tanga\\" was played, it sounded different, > depending on a soloist's individuality. In August, 1948, when trumpeter > Howard McGhee soloed with Machito's orchestra at the Apollo Theatre, his ad- > libs to \\"Tanga\\" resulted in \\"Cu-Bop City,\\" a tune which was recorded by > Roost Records months later. The jams which took place at the Royal Roots, > Bop City and Birdland between 1948 - 49, when Howard McGhee, tenor > saxophonist Brew Moore, Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie sat in with the > Machito orchestra, were unrehearsed, uninhibited, unheard of before jam > sessions which at the time, master of ceremonies Symphony Sid called Afro- > Cuban jazz. The Machito orchestra's ten- or fifteen-minute jams were the > first in Latin music to break away from the traditional under four-minute > recordings. In February, 1949, the Machito orchestra became the first to set > a precedent in Latin music when it featured tenor saxophonist Flip Phillips > in a five-minute recording of \\"Tanga.\\" The twelve inch 78 RPM, part of The > Jazz Scene album, sold for $25‚ÄîSalazar (1997).Salazar, Max (1997). \\"The > Beginning and Its Best\\" Latin Beat Magazine v.7 n. 1. The right hand of the \\"Tanga\\" piano guajeo is in the style known as ponchando, a type of non-arpeggiated guajeo using block chords. The sequence of attack- points is emphasized, rather than a sequence of different pitches. As a form of accompaniment it can be played in a strictly repetitive fashion or as a varied motif akin to jazz comping.Pe√±alosa, David 2010.

Because of this, all three instruments heightened their roles in Afro-Cuban based dance music. The use of broken bell patterns by the bongocero in mambo horn sections, the increased rhythmic vocabulary of the conga drum and its function in a band setting, the increased importance of the timbales role in setting up figures played by the horns and accenting them as a jazz drummer would do in a big band. e.g. \\"Nague\\", also the first recorded example of all three percussion instruments playing as a section. * 2 - The first band to explore jazz arranging techniques with Afro-Cuban rhythms. Cuban big band arranger Chico O'Farrill stated, \\"This was a new concept in interpreting Cuban music with as much (harmonic) richness as possible. You have to understand how important this was. It made every other band that came after, followers.\\"Notes from The Mambo Inn ‚Äì The Story of Mario Bauz√°. PBS documentary (1998). * 3 - The first band to explore modal harmony, a concept explored much later by Miles Davis and Gil Evans, from a jazz arranging perspective through their recording of \\"Tanga\\". Of note is the \\"sheet of sound\\" effect through the use of multiple layering. * 4 - The first big band to explore, from an Afro-Cuban rhythmic perspective, large scale extended compositional works. e.g. \\"The Afro-Cuban Jazz Suite\\" by Chico O'Farill. * 5 - The first band to wed jazz big band arranging techniques in an original composition with jazz oriented soloists using an Afro-Cuban based rhythm section. e.g. Gene Johnson - alto, Brew Moore - tenor, composition - \\"Tanga\\" (1943). * 6 - The first multi-racial band in the United States. * 7 - The first band in the United States to use the term \\"Afro-Cuban\\" as the band's moniker (Machito & The Afro-Cubans), thus acknowledging the West African roots of the music. * 8 - The first Afro-Cuban based dance band to overtly explore the concept of clave counterpoint from an arranging standpoint. The ability to weave seamlessly from one side of the clave to the other without breaking its rhythmic integrity within the structure of a musical arrangement. * 9 - The band set a standard of professionalism and musical excellence that had to be met by band leaders such as Jos√© Curbelo, Tito Puente, Marcelino Guerra, Tito Rodr√≠guez, Elmo Garc√≠a, and any group that followed. Although it could be clearly argued that Xavier Cugat had established an extremely high level of professionalism much earlier with his orchestra at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel (1931), the sound emulated by the majority of bandleaders in New York City was not that of Cugat but that of the Machito Afro-Cubans. Cugat performed for high society elite, not for the Latino community which was concentrated in East Harlem (El Barrio) and the South Bronx. Cugat's sound was one they may have experienced through recordings on radio, but this community had little access to it. * 10 - The Machito Afro-Cubans provided a proving ground for the exchange of progressive musical ideas for Afro-Cuban based dance music and its fusion with jazz arranging techniques, along with jazz oriented soloists in a multi-racial framework that had not existed before. 3-2 clave () and 2-3 clave () written in cut-time. While he was music director for Machito, Mario Bauz√° developed the 3-2 / 2-3 clave concept and terminology. A chord progression can begin on either side of clave. When the progression begins on the three-side, the song or song section is said to be in 3-2 clave. When the chord progression begins on the two-side, it is in 2-3 clave. In North America salsa and Latin jazz charts commonly represent clave in two measures of cut-time (2/2); this is most likely the influence of jazz conventions.Maule√≥n, Rebeca (1993: 52) Salsa Guidebook for Piano and Ensemble. Petaluma, California: Sher Music. . When clave is written in two measures (above) changing from one clave sequence to the other is a matter of reversing the order of the measures. =From one side of clave to the other= The 3-2/2-3 concept and terminology was developed in New York City during the 1940s by Cuban-born Mario Bauza while he was music director of Machito and His Afro-Cubans.Bobby Sanabria quoted by Pe√±alosa (2009: 252) The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. Bauz√° was a master at moving the song from one side of clave to the other. The following melodic excerpt is taken from the opening verses of \\"Que vengan los rumberos\\" by Machito and his Afro-Cubans. The melody goes from one side of clave to the other and then back. A measure of 2/4 moves the chord progression from the two-side (2-3), to the three-side (3-2). Later, another measure of 2/4 moves the start of the chord progression back to two-side (2-3). Clap clave along with the excerpt in order to hear and feel the melody move from one side to the other. > The first 4 1‚ÅÑ2 claves of the verses are in 2-3. Following the measure of > 2/4 (half clave) the song flips to the three-side. It continues in 3-2 on > the V7 chord for 4 1‚ÅÑ2 claves. The second measure of 2/4 flips the song back > to the two-side and the I chord. In songs like \\"Que vengan los rumberos,\\" > the phrases continually alternate between a 3-2 framework and a 2-3 > framework. It takes a certain amount of flexibility to repeatedly reorder > your orientation in this way. The most challenging moments are the > truncations and other transitional phrases where you \\"pivot\\" in order to > move your point of reference from one side of clave to the other. Clap clave > along with this excerpt.

By the time the > song changes to 3-2 on the V7 chord, Machito has developed a considerable > amount of rhythmic tension by contradicting the underlying meter.

The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its > Principles and African Origins. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. . Personal life Machito was somewhat short in stature, at in height. A lifelong Roman Catholic, he married Puerto Rican Hilda Torres on January 17, 1940, at which time he changed his nickname from \\"Macho\\" to \\"Machito\\". The cross-national marriage served as a sign to New York Latinos that it was possible to attain a sense of pan-Latino brotherhood. Frank and Hilda Grillo produced five children: Martha (1941), Frank Jr (1943), Barbara (1948), Mario (1956) and Paula. The family lived in Spanish Harlem at 112th Street and Second Avenue, where Machito enjoyed cooking for his children, writing the occasional song such as \\"Sopa de Pichon\\" while working in the kitchen. Machito suffered a stroke before a concert in London, England in 1984, collapsing while waiting to go on stage at Ronnie Scott's club. He died four days later on April 19, 1984, at University College Hospital in London. His son Mario carried forward the legacy by leading The Machito Orchestra after his father's death. His daughter Paula, though dedicating her life to scholarly studies, has occasionally fronted the group as its singer. Mario Bauza died in 1993. Hilda Grillo, a patron of Latin music after her husband's death, died in July 1997. Having never married, Graciela died in April 2010 at the age of 94. Legacy In 1985, New York mayor Ed Koch named the intersection of East 111th Street and Third Avenue \\"Machito Square\\", a location in Spanish Harlem which is one block from East 110th Street, renamed \\"Tito Puente Way\\" after the 2000 death of Tito Puente. Machito lived as a young adult in an apartment on the southwest corner of the intersection. Originally appeared in The New York Times. A documentary film by Carlo Ortiz, Machito: A Latin Jazz Legacy, was released in 1987, showing an elderly Machito and his wife in their Bronx apartment, as well as archival footage from performances in the 1940s and afterward.

Their musical director, and an important musical innovator, was Mario Bauz√°, Machito's brother-in-law. The Afro-Cubans combined Cuban music with orchestrations derived from swing. As well, the Afro-Cubans played with and incorporated the music of many important figures in contemporary jazz, including Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Flip Phillips, and Buddy Rich; but the association went both ways, as the Latin rhythms of the Afro-Cubans strongly influenced the jazz scene in New York. After making some early 78s for Decca, the Afro-Cubans began to increase in popularity towards the end of World War II, appearing with‚Äîand no doubt influencing -- Stan Kenton's orchestra. (Machito played maracas on Kenton's recordings of \\"The Peanut Vendor\\" and \\"Cuban Carnival\\") and recorded for Mercury and Clef. On Bauz√°'s urging, Machito's band featured a galaxy of American jazz soloists on its recordings from 1948 to 1960, including Charlie Parker (heard memorably on \\"No Noise\\"), Dizzy Gillespie, Flip Phillips, Howard McGhee, Buddy Rich, Harry \\"Sweets\\" Edison, Cannonball Adderley, Herbie Mann, Curtis Fuller and Johnny Griffin.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1899 to 1915 as a member of the Conservative Party, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Rodmond Roblin. Born in the county and province of Ontario, the son of Noble and Sarah (Lyons) Lawrence, both of whom were natives of Ireland, he was educated in Zephyr, Ontario and Uxbridge, Ontario. In 1878 he moved to Manitoba to work as a farmer. In religion, Lawrence was a Presbyterian. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1892 provincial election, in the constituency of Killarney. He lost to Liberal incumbent Finlay Young by 153 votes. He ran again in the 1899 election, and this time defeated Young by 140 votes. The Conservatives won a majority government in this election, and Lawrence served as a government backbencher. He was easily returned in the 1903 election, as the opposition vote was split between Liberal and Prohibition candidates. Lawrence was re-elected in the 1907 provincial election, defeating Liberal R.L. Richardson by 156 votes. He was again returned in the 1910 campaign, and was promoted to Roblin's cabinet on October 11, 1911 as Minister of Agriculture and Immigration. Lawrence was elected for a fifth time in the 1914 election, defeating Liberal Samuel Hayden by 68 votes. He was retained in his cabinet portfolio for the legislative session that followed. In 1915, the Roblin administration was forced to resign from office after a report commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor found the government guilty of corruption in the tendering of contracts for new legislative buildings. All ministers in the government, including Lawrence, resigned their portfolios on May 12, 1915. A new election was called, which the Liberals won in a landslide. Lawrence lost the Killarney constituency of Hayden, by 124 votes.

The uprising was in the form of the conflict between human rights and animal ones, the rebels being the supporters of the latter. The uprising was accompanied by violence against the members and supporters of Bar Confederation, Poles, Old Believers (Muscovites, bloody katzaps), Armenians, Moslems, Greeks, other minorities and often Jews and Roman Catholics and sometimes even Uniate clergy, culminating in the massacre of Uman. The number of victims is estimated from 100,000 to 200,000, because many communities of national minorities (such as Old Believers, Armenians, Moslems, Greeks completely disappeared in the area of uprising). Etymology The origin of the word is not certain. According to the poem of Taras Shevchenko whose grandfather and villagers participated in this uprising Haydamaky (poem) Koliy is the name of a knife, blessed in a church and used by special people in Ukrainian and Ruthenian villages sometimes up to nowadays to kill animals humanly according to the local understanding of animal rights. The blessing of knives was 2-3 weeks before the uprising as a rule so the members and supporters of Bar confederation and its regular military forces fled to the Ottoman empire before uprising. But some fortresses such as Uman , Lysyanka etc. were still occupied by the members of Bar confederation. The secret shared by millions people could not be the secret and different national minorities accused in atrocities towards animals retreated to these fortresses as well. The poem of Schevchenko is the best description though he considers village drinkings after massacres as the part of uprising. He explains that Ukrainians apart from professional kolii have never killed even chicken and other animals before this uprising and bloodletting led to drinking as the most continuous part of uprising. These kolii are similar to Rezniks and may be the heritage of the Khazar-Russian kaganate (Kievan Rus) in Ukraine. Kolii have never been present among Russians,Poles (in spite of Sarmat roots of Polish noblemen) , Lithuanians, Byelorussians, Moslems, Armenians, Romanians even Greeks in spite of their Orthodoxy and life together with Ukrainians. Shevchenko emphasized, that this was the first uprising for the animal rights worldwide and rebels wanted to clean Ukraine from bad animals (especially Old-Believers, (Muscovits), Armenians, Greeks, Moslems etc. who tortured poor good real animals killing them without kolii. Ukrainian Poles often used meat from animals slaughtered by kolii and Jews used meat slaughtered by rezniks in the way very similar to kolii, so Zaliznyak solemnly rejected any plans of massacre of Jews and Poles explaining the massacre by the excess of executors).

Ukrayinska Pravda. 16 December 2015 Outlook It was simultaneous to the Confederation of Bar which originated out of the adjacent region in the city of Bar (historical Podolia) and was a de facto civil war in Poland. Bar confederation declared not only the Orthodox faith but the Uniate church pro-Russian ones. Later the Polish government and the Polish Roman Catholic church accused both eastern churches responsible on the Uman massacre and the uprising because Russia defended the political rights of believers of both churches. Though almost all pupils of the Uman Uniate seminary had died in the massacre in Uman they were accused in the fall of the city by the Polish government.The bridge between west and east. Russian Greek Catholic church There were rumors that Don Cossacks fighting against Bar confederation needed help from Zaporozhian Cossacks so many Zaporozhian Cossacks left for Right-Bank Ukraine to join Don Cossacks. Some of they became leaders of different detachments. Some were seized by governmental Polish forces and tried in Kodnya by Poles. One Zaporozhian Cossack was executed in Kodnya. These Cossacks were not paid. The rebellion of peasants was fueled by ducats paid by Maxim Zaliznyak for every killed Bar confederate (a blue-eyed old-believer because women and children could not find confederates to have a reward) and by the circulation of a fictitious proclamation of support and call to arms by Russia's Empress Catherine II, the so called \\"Golden Charter\\".Golden Charter at Encyclopedia of Ukraine Mostly based on rumors, the charter however had a real foundation and was connected with the Repnin's seim decisions to give politicall freedoms to Uniates and Orthodox Christians and the Catherine's rescript that in 1765 she issued it to Archimandrite Melkhisedek and obligated the Russian ambassador in Warsaw to facilitate assertion of rights and privileges of the Right-bank Ukraine Orthodox confession.Catherinian Golden Edict at Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine In 1764, on territory of the Zaporizhian Host and along the southern borders of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Russian Empire created New Russia Governorate in place of previously existing New Serbia province and was intensively militarised.First New Russia Governorate at Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine Preparation to uprising against Bar Confederation and the initial raid of the Cossack detachment of Maksym Zalizniak started at the Motrynine Saint Trinity Monastery (today a covenant in Chyhyryn Raion), a hegumen of which was Archimandrite Melkhisedek (Znachko- Yavorsky) who also served as the director of all Orthodox monasteries and churches in Right-bank Ukraine (in 1761-1768).Koliyivshchyna at Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine The peasant rebellion quickly gained momentum and spread over the territory from the right bank of the Dnieper River to the river Syan. At Uman it led to a big massacre. In Uman Poles, Jews and Uniates were herded into their churches and synagogues and killed in cold blood though Uniates were not the victims in other places. In three weeks of unbridled violence the rebels slaughtered 20,000 people, according to numerous Polish sources. The leaders of the uprising were Cossacks mainly Maksym Zalizniak and a commander of a private militia of the owner of Uman Ivan Gonta. While being the commander of the Potocki's private Uman city Cossack militia garrison, the latter joined Zalizniak at Uman and the governor and other Polish nobles supporting Bar confederation capitulated knowing that Gonta was dispatched by Polish Count Franciszek Salezy Potocki to protect Uman by some secret mission. They mistakenly thought that rebels supported the Polish king similar to count Potocki. But insurgents were for the principally new Zaporozhian Host of Right-Bank Ukraine. Eventually the uprising was crushed by Russian troops, Ukrainian registered cossacks of Left-Bank Ukraine, Zaporozhian Host aided by Polish army. Two its major leaders were arrested by the Russian troops on 7 July 1768. Ivan Gonta was handed over to Polish authorities who tortured him to death, while Maksym Zalizniak was exiled to Siberia. The rebellion was suppressed by the joint forces of Polish and Russian armies, with numerous hangings, decapitations, quarterings and impalings of Polish subjects and of those Russian subjects who were captured by governmental Polish forces themselves. Koliyivshchyna in popular culture Taras Shevchenko's epic poem Haidamaky (The Haidamakas) chronicles the events of the Koliyivshchnyna. The event also inspired recent artwork during the latest Ukrainian unrest.\\"ICONS ON THE BARRICADES: INCREDIBLE UKRAINIAN PROTEST ART\\" ArtNews. Retrieved 2015-08-23.

The bill for this Act was a private member's bill. This Act was passed to update the legislation on legal deposit to reflect the digital age. The previous provisions covering legal deposit in the United Kingdom were under the Copyright Act 1911. They covered published paper products of almost all types, excluding only ephemera such as diaries and bus timetables. By the beginning of the 21st century many publications appeared in electronic form, either exclusively or in addition to their print form. A voluntary set of rules for deposit had been drawn up a few years earlier but it was felt that the additional force of statute was required to ensure the British national published record remained complete. As under the previous legislation there are six libraries entitled to printed works. The British Library is entitled to a copy of every printed work published in the United Kingdom. A publisher must send a copy to the British Library within a month of the work being published. The copy sent to the British Library must be of the same quality as the best copies published in the UK at the time. The other five libraries, the Bodleian Library, the Cambridge University Library, the Library of Trinity College, Dublin, the National Library of Wales and the National Library of Scotland are not automatically entitled to be sent a copy of the printed works. However, the five libraries have the right to send a publisher a request for a printed work within twelve months of the publication of the work. The publisher must deliver a copy within a month of receipt of the request. The quality of works sent to any of the five libraries must be of the same quality as the largest number of copies of the work published in the UK at the time of the request. Trinity College Dublin is included in the Act despite it being outside the UK's jurisdiction, as the Act continued the more ancient right bestowed on the college in 1801, when Ireland was part of the Union. Each of these five libraries sends requests via the Agency for the Legal Deposit Libraries, who receives copies of the works and distributes them to the individual libraries. Publishers may also send copies to the Agency in advance of a request being submitted to them. The 2003 Act includes provisions for the deposit of non-print publications such as CD-ROMs and copies of websites. The Secretary of State is given powers to make regulations governing the deposit of non-print publications. The regulations are permitted to include such things as provisions determining how and when a non-print publication must be deposited; when an online work is considered to be published in the UK and therefore subject to the 2003 Act; the quality and means of delivery of the copy of the work; the format that the deposited copy must be presented in where different formats of the work exist; an obligation to give the deposit library information to make the work accessible and the timing when deposit must be made. There are also restrictions put in place as to the activities that may be undertaken with the non-print publications, unless those activities are authorised by regulations made by the Secretary of State. Those restrictions include copying the material, adapting a computer program or database, lending the material, transferring the material to a third party or disposing of the material. Even the using of the material is prohibited subject to regulations stating otherwise. The power to make regulations restricting various matters, including when non-print publications may be used, which readers may use the material and how many people may use a non-print publication at once is also provided for. The 2003 Act also contains provisions that prevent regulations meaning publishers must deposit non-print publications at Trinity College, Dublin unless Irish law on copyright and related rights contains equivalent protections to British copyright law, that the restrictions on the acts that may be done with non-print publications are equivalent to British law and that the liability exceptions in Irish law are equivalent to those in British law. The 2003 Act also inserted various exceptions to copyright and database right into the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 and the Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulations 1997 to prevent the use of non-print publications by deposit libraries infringing copyright and/or database rights. However, the 2003 Act enabled regulations to be made restricting the exceptions to copyright for non-print publications so that deposited works may not be copied more freely than an equivalent work available at an ordinary library. Various exemptions from liability against breach of contract; infringement of copyright, database right or publication right; criminal liability or damages for defamation were also enacted by the 2003 Act to protect deposit libraries using works and publishers sending works to deposit libraries from actions for breach of those liabilities that could otherwise occur. Section 16 of the 2003 Act and the power to make regulations came into force upon Royal Assent of the 2003 Act. The rest of the Act was brought into force on 1 February 2004 by article 2 of the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 (Commencement) Order 2004 (SI 2004/130) (C 5). The 2003 Act extends to the whole of the United Kingdom.

Miller, and starring Pierce Brosnan in the titular role of Robinson Crusoe, based on Daniel Defoe's 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe. Plot The film opens to a fictionalized Daniel Defoe being offered to read a castaway's autobiography. He grudgingly obliges and begins to get engrossed in the narrative. Robinson Crusoe (Pierce Brosnan) is a Scottish gentleman with experience in the Royal Navy and the British army. He accidentally kills his lifelong friend Patrick (Damian Lewis) in a duel over his childhood love Mary. Patrick's brothers arrive and threaten Crusoe, but his page manages to buy time for an escape. Fleeing back to Mary, Crusoe subsequently ends up leaving for a year so that Mary can attempt to smooth over relations with Patrick's family. Crusoe joins the merchant marine transporting assorted cargoes between ports in the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic oceans. He chronicles the ship's journeys at the behest of the captain until a typhoon shipwrecks him near the coast of New Guinea. On his first day ashore on the island he buries other crew members who had washed up on the surrounding beaches. The next day he heads to the ship, which has beached itself on a reef. He salvages tools, supplies and weapons from the ship. Crusoe also frees the captain's corgi Skipper from a supply room. Crusoe begins to acclimate himself to the island while hoping for a passing European ship. One day a ship finally appears, but Crusoe notices it too late to be rescued. Crusoe resolves to acclimate himself to the island and moves inland, building a shelter and growing food. One day he hears ominous drums and human voices. Investigating the noises he finds a tribe from a nearby island making human sacrifices. After two prisoners have been sacrificed Crusoe intervenes by firing his weapon, which allows the third prisoner (played by William Takaku) to escape. Later he meets the escaped native and attempts to befriend him. Cultural and language barriers prevent him from communicating before they are attacked by a group of the tribesmen. He witnesses the native cut out the heart of a defeated enemy and calls him a savage heathen before fleeing to his shelter and preparing a defence. Days later Crusoe falls into a snare laid by the native. Crusoe communicates the danger and potency of his firearms on a bat, which allows them to begin communicating. He names the man Friday and has himself referred to as Master. Within six months Friday has learned the basics of English, but when Crusoe attempts to convert him to Christianity, Friday refuses and an argument ensues. Friday separates himself from Crusoe. Missing the companionship, Crusoe attempts to make peace with Friday. Reunited, the two set a trap for the tribe of natives who attempted to sacrifice Friday before. Once they arrive Crusoe lights a fuse leading to a load of gunpowder, but Skipper chases after the lit fuse and also dies in the explosion. At Skipper's funeral Crusoe gains a deeper appreciation for Friday's religion. Later Crusoe decides they must leave the island due to an impending attack by the native tribe. Friday mentions that he has heard of New Britain. He says he cannot take Crusoe to his home island because he is considered dead for being a sacrifice and he cannot go to New Britain because the Europeans enslave his people. Friday subsequently learns that \\"Master\\" is not Crusoe's real name, but an indicator of enslavement and once again leaves Crusoe, who subsequently attempts to build a canoe to get to New Britain by himself. A typhoon arrives while Crusoe has nearly finished his boat. Friday returns and accepts that Crusoe had decided not to make him a slave. The two attempt to salvage their crops and wildlife, but the typhoon destroys them ‚Äì as well as Crusoe's canoe. The pair set traps to defend the island, but expect to die in the defence. The tribesmen arrive in force. Crusoe and Friday manage to defend the island, but Crusoe is shot by an arrow. Friday decides to try to save Crusoe by taking him to his home island. Upon arriving there Friday's tribe capture Crusoe, believing him to have come to enslave the people. They force Crusoe to fight Friday to the death for his freedom. After sparing Friday, Friday is about to land a killing blow when he is hit by a bullet. But Crusoe becomes upset because Friday was his friend. A European scout party rescues Crusoe and returns him to Scotland where he is reunited with Mary.

Athletic career Van Lierde's international career started in 1990 when he came fourth in the World Olympic Distance Triathlon Championships. In the full-length Ironman triathlon, which involves swimming 3.8 km, cycling 180 km and running a 42.2 km marathon, he was ranked among the first ten in the European Championships three times between 1990 and 1995. 1995 was a decisive year for Luc Van Lierde, when he took second place at the ITU World Championships, and came second in the European Olympic Distance Triathlon Championships. In 1996 he won the European Championships and came second in the World Championships in the Olympic Distance Triathlon. He won the Nice Triathlon and became World Long Course Triathlon Champion. Luc Van Lierde became the first European ever to win the Ironman World Championship, beating the existing record by three minutes. Luc Van Lierde went on to clock the fastest Ironman Triathlon ever in 1997, doing 7:50:27 (0:44, 4:28, 2:36, plus transition) in Ironman Europe. Absent from the Ironman 1998, after undergoing an operation, he nevertheless won the Flemish Sports Personality of the Year trophy. In 1999, he once again won the Ironman World Championship in Hawaii, outrunning the second placed competitor by six minutes. During that same year, he received the Giant of Flanders trophy awarded by the two Flanders section of the Association of Professional Journalists. Triathlon coach In 2009, after more than 20 years as a professional triathlete, Van Lierde began a career as a triathlon coach. Frederik Van Lierde (not related) approached Van Lierde with the request to coach him. One year later he managed to coach Frederik Van Lierde to a third place at the 2012 Ironman World Championship. In 2013, he coached Frederik to the 2013 Ironman World Championship. By doing so Van Lierde became the first male to win the Ironman World Championship as an athlete and as a coach.

Members of ABA include nursing mothers and their partners as well as health professionals such as doctors, lactation consultants and midwives. ABA was founded in Melbourne, Victoria in 1964 as the Nursing Mothers' Association, with the aim of giving mother-to-mother support to breastfeeding women. It is Australia's leading source of breastfeeding information and support. The association is supported by health authorities and specialists in infant and child health and nutrition, including a panel of honorary advisers. History Mary Paton founded the Nursing Mothers' Association with five other mothers in Melbourne after having difficulty breastfeeding her first child. There was a lack of support and accurate information about breastfeeding. Doctors and nurses at the time were not trained to handle breastfeeding problems and with the modern nuclear family there were few older women to turn to for advice, so the founding members supported each other, thus creating the model for mother-to-mother support than continues today. The other founders were Glenise Francis, Pat Patterson, Jan Barry (a member of the Coles family), Pauline Pick and Sue Woods. The first meeting was held in Melbourne at Mary Paton's house on 13 February 1964 and the first newsletter was published later that year. Initially based primarily in Victoria, the ABA gradually spread to other states and territories with state representatives for the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia appointed in 1969, the national headquarters set up in Hawthorn, Victoria in 1970, and groups established in South Australia and Tasmania in 1971. The ABA had over 10,000 members by 1973. In 2001, NMAA changed its name to Australian Breastfeeding Association. As at 2016, over 350,000 people have been members. Services The ABA has groups across Australia which hold discussion meetings for mothers. Breastfeeding education seminars are run for expectant parents; community education continues through all levels of education from pre-school to tertiary and members visits mothers in hospital to introduce the association and its services. ABA holds seminars and conferences for health professionals. The ABA is a Registered Training Organisation and provides training in breastfeeding counselling and community education. On 20 March 2009, a national breastfeeding helpline was launched to improve on the previous state-level helplines. This helpline is staffed by volunteers who have completed the ABA's training. In 2015 the ABA launched the Breastfeeding Friendly Environments program to provide support to mothers returning to work. Healthcare applications Baby Eve with Georgia for the Breastfeeding Support Project In Australia, during January 2014, Melbourne tech startup Small World Social collaborated with the Australian Breastfeeding Association to create the first hands-free breastfeeding Google Glass application for new mothers. The application, named Google Glass Breastfeeding app trial, allows mothers to nurse their baby while viewing instructions about common breastfeeding issues (latching on, posture etc.) or call a lactation consultant via a secure Google Hangout, who can view the issue through the mother's Google Glass camera. The trial was successfully concluded in Melbourne in April 2014, and 100% of participants were breastfeeding confidently. Small World Social Breasfteeding Support Project Controversy A Sunday Mail news story in August 2012 reported that during an Australian Breastfeeding Association class the undercover reporter was told a baby died \\"every 30 seconds\\" from formula and \\"Formula is a little bit like AIDS,\\".

Due to the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming, and the efforts of Florey and Chain in 1938, large-scale, pharmaceutical production of antibiotics has been made possible. As with the initial discovery of penicillin, most antibiotics have been discovered as a result of happenstance. Antibiotic production can be grouped into three methods: natural fermentation, semi-synthetic, and synthetic. As more and more bacteria continue to develop resistance to currently produced antibiotics, research and development of new antibiotics continues to be important. In addition to research and development into the production of new antibiotics, repackaging delivery systems is important to improving efficacy of the antibiotics that are currently produced. Improvements to this field have seen the ability to add antibiotics directly into implanted devices, aerosolization of antibiotics for direct delivery, and combination of antibiotics with non antibiotics to improve outcomes. The increase of antibiotic resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria has led to an increased urgency for the funding of research and development of antibiotics and a desire for production of new and better acting antibiotics.  Identifying useful antibiotics  An agar plate streaked with microorganisms Despite the wide variety of known antibiotics, less than 1% of antimicrobial agents have medical or commercial value. For example, whereas penicillin has a high therapeutic index as it does not generally affect human cells, this is not so for many antibiotics. Other antibiotics simply lack advantage over those already in use, or have no other practical applications. Useful antibiotics are often discovered using a screening process. To conduct such a screen, isolates of many different microorganisms are cultured and then tested for production of diffusible products that inhibit the growth of test organisms. Most antibiotics identified in such a screen are already known and must therefore be disregarded. The remainder must be tested for their selective toxicities and therapeutic activities, and the best candidates can be examined and possibly modified. A more modern version of this approach is a rational design program. This involves screening directed towards finding new natural products that inhibit a specific target, such as an enzyme only found in the target pathogen, rather than tests to show general inhibition of a culture. Research into antibiotic identification has shown the opportunity exists to move away from lawn spotting methodology, a methodology which increases the chances of cross contamination. This new methodology involves using Lactobacillus species and shows a clear zone of inhibition as well as allowing for a determination of minimum inhibitory concentration.  Industrial production techniques  = Fermentation = Industrial microbiology can be used to produce antibiotics via the process of fermentation, where the source microorganism is grown in large containers (100,000‚Äì150,000 liters or more) containing a liquid growth medium. Oxygen concentration, temperature, pH and nutrient levels must be optimal, and are closely monitored and adjusted if necessary. As antibiotics are secondary metabolites, the population size must be controlled very carefully to ensure that maximum yield is obtained before the cells die. Once the process is complete, the antibiotic must be extracted and purified to a crystalline product. This is easier to achieve if the antibiotic is soluble in organic solvent. Otherwise it must first be removed by ion exchange, adsorption or chemical precipitation. = Semi-synthetic = A common form of antibiotic production in modern times is semi-synthetic. Semi-synthetic production of antibiotics is a combination of natural fermentation and laboratory work to maximize the antibiotic. Maximization can occur through efficacy of the drug itself, amount of antibiotics produced, and potency of the antibiotic being produced. Depending on the drug being produced and the ultimate usage of said antibiotic determines what one is attempting to produce. An example of semi- synthetic production involves the drug ampicillin. A beta lactam antibiotic just like penicillin, ampicillin was developed by adding an addition amino group (NH2) to the R group of penicillin. This additional amino group gives ampicillin a broader spectrum of use than penicillin. Methicillin is another derivative of penicillin and was discovered in the late 1950s, the key difference between penicillin and methicillin being the addition of two methoxy groups to the phenyl group. These methoxy groups allow methicillin to be used against penicillinase producing bacteria that would otherwise be resistant to penicillin. = Synthetic = Not all antibiotics are produced by bacteria; some are made completely synthetically in the lab. These include the quinolone class, of which nalidixic acid is often credited as the first to be discovered. Like other antibiotics before it the discovery of nalidixic acid has been chalked up to an accident, discovered when George Lesher was attempting to synthesize chloroquine. However a recent investigation into the origin of quinolones have discovered that a description for quinolones happened in 1949 and that patents were filed concerning quinolones some 5 years before Lesher's discovery.  Strains used for the production  In the earliest years of antibiotic discovery the antibiotics being discovered were naturally produced antibiotics and were either produced by fungi, such as the antibiotic penicillin, or by soil bacteria, which can produce antibiotics including streptomycin and tetracycline. Microorganisms used in fermentation are rarely identical to the wild type. This is because species are often genetically modified to yield the maximum amounts of antibiotics. Mutation is often used, and is encouraged by introducing mutagens such as ultraviolet radiation, x-rays or certain chemicals. Selection and further reproduction of the higher yielding strains over many generations can raise yields by 20-fold or more. Another technique used to increase yields is gene amplification, where copies of genes coding for enzymes involved in the antibiotic production can be inserted back into a cell, via vectors such as plasmids. This process must be closely linked with retesting of antibiotic production. Some antibiotics are produced naturally by fungi. These include the cephalosporin producing Acremonium chrysogenum. Geldanamycin is produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Erythromycin is produced by what was called Streptomyces erythreus and is now known as Saccharopolyspora erythraea. Streptomycin is produced by Streptomyces griseus. Tetracycline is produced by Streptomyces aureofaciens Vancomycin is produced by Streptomyces orientalis, now known as Amycolatopsis orientalis.  Advancements  Penicillin was the first of the antibiotics to be discovered. After the discovery there was the issue of taking the raw naturally produced penicillin and developing a method so that wide-scale production of a clinically significant antibiotic could occur. Over the course of many years a team led by Florey and Chain and based in Oxford was able to successfully purify, concentrate, and produce the antibiotic. Advances in scientific technology have not always led to better conditions for the production of antibiotics. Since 1987 there have been no new classes of antibiotics discovered for industrial production and widespread usage. However new developments in genomic sequencing and technology have led to improvements and discovery in the field of antibiotic production. Genomic engineering of antibiotic gene clusters has already been shown to lead to an increase in production of different antibiotics.  Antibiotic production and delivery method  Antibiotics do not render themselves fully functional and deliverable simply by being produced. Often modifications must be made to the antibiotics so that maximum efficiency is attained. Post-production modifications include making antibiotics aerosolized so as to bypass doing unnecessary damage to bacteria located in other parts of the body and instead going directly to the lungs. Nosocomial infections can lead to serious complications during and in the recovery following surgery or a hospital stay in general. By merging surgical implants with antibiotics, healthcare providers are able to strike at a specific high risk area of infection without having to use a body wide size dosage of antibiotics. Meropenem is an antibiotic that is delivered into the body via injection. When produced meropenem is a crystalline antibiotic, so it must be mixed in with solution before injection can occur. During this process meropenem is mixed with sodium carbonate, then diluted in water after which it can be injected. Aerosolization of antibiotics is necessary because infections of the lung are especially troublesome, which is why direct targeting of the infection is needed. Broad spectrum antibiotics can have detrimental side effects when their action is also taken against necessary non-pathogenic bacteria residing in the human microbiome. Aerosolization is effective in bypassing the microbiome that exists in the gastrointestinal tract by directing the antibiotic directly to the lungs. This process is undertaken after the production of the antibiotic itself. The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has affected implantation of medical devices. In some cases it is no longer enough for devices to be sterile when they are implanted into an individual, now they must be proactive in fighting off bacterial infection. As such antibiotics are now being added into the surface of implanted devices as an added layer of defense against the threat of infection. One such infection is Osteomyelitis which can offer a unique challenges in treatment efforts, one novel approach has been the creation of antibiotic cement nails which can be inserted into the infected bone. First described by Paley and Herzenberg antibiotic cement nails have dual purpose, both of stabilization of the bone being treated, and prevention against post-procedure infection. Antibiotic cement nails are inserted during surgery, and are produced around the time of procedure using materials available in the operating room setting. Antibiotics are mixed in with cement filling then molded around a support anchor, often chest tubes are used to ensure proper molding. Chest tubes have the advantage of being cheap and ubiquitous and have been shown to have uniformity in the production of antibiotic cement nails. The antibiotics fill the voids within the cement matrix, and upon drying and setting can be inserted into the bone. The antibiotic has a direct contact with the area of infection and retains its properties in acting upon the infection. In addition to cement nails, antibiotic cement spacers have been used to treat and prevent osteomyelitis, and for a longer period of time. In producing the antibiotic cement material it is necessary to choose antibiotics that will be effective in this hybrid form, it has been found that antibiotics in powder form that are broad spectrum are of best use. There are recommendations for the amount of antibiotic that is used when mixing in with the cement, but industry wide guidelines have not been established.  Challenges  Development of antibiotics is difficult, whereas many drug discoveries have been a result of concerted effort and intensive research and development, antibiotics have seemingly been discovered by chance. Since 1987 there have been no discoveries or development of a new class of antibiotics. This is partly due to the finicky nature of antibiotics. As most are produced biosynthetically they require an organism to produce. Historically this has meant that different species are grown and observed for any antimicrobial activity. Not only does this require a culturable species to start off with, but the conditions the species are grown in must be adequate for production of antibiotics as well as having the number of antibiotics produced reach a density threshold so that their function can be observed. Another reason behind the lack of new antibiotic production is the diminishing amount of return on investment for antibiotics and thus the lack resources put into research and development by private pharmaceutical companies. The World Health Organization has recognized the danger of antibiotic resistance bacteria and has created a list of \\"priority pathogens\\" that are of the utmost concern. In doing so the hope is to stimulate R&D; that can create a new generation of antibiotics. In the United States, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) aims to support the work of the industry to produce new antibiotics. The buildup of inorganic phosphate can limit the biosynthetic production of certain antibiotics, researchers found that by using an inorganic phosphate trapping agent, the phosphate would be sequestered away and antibiotic production would return to normal levels, thus allowing production to continue. Meropenem is mixed with sodium carbonate post-production before being injected into the body, subsequent analysis of this mixture using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance has shown that a second form of Meropenem is produced. This second form has an additional carbon dioxide on it, and exists alongside the pure form. In order to ensure that Meropenem stays in the correct form a four-step process was developed wherein the crude form is mixed together with a base in water, a proper pH is established, the product is treated with alkanols, and then the pure form is isolated.

As Portland and Dorset's southernmost village, it lies between Portland Bill and the villages of Easton and Weston. Though close to the Bill, the village is sheltered by hills on three sides. It is the only village on Portland not to be designated a conservation area.https://www.dorsetforyou.com/416983https://www.dorsetforyou.com/media/199172/Portland- conservation-area- appraisal/pdf/Appraisal_of_the_Conservation_Areas_of_Portland.pdf The Great Southwell Landslip, named after the village, remains Britain's second largest recorded historical landslide on the east side of Portland, occurring in 1734, between Durdle Pier and Freshwater Bay, at a distance of one and a half miles. History Southwell has medieval origins, and was established around a natural watercourse and various springs. It is likely that the Romans developed the village water sources. The various archaeological finds around the village include Iron Age earth defences and Roman stone sarcophagi. The village grew with agricultural industry, and was surrounded by strip fields, also known as lawnsheds. From the 1840s onwards Portland saw a large increase within its population, due to the construction of Portland Harbour's Breakwaters.http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/Portland/PYB/Population.html The island's wells and ponds could not cope, and so in 1890 work began on the digging of a deep shaft at Southwell for a new water supply. The work continued until May 1895, however the shaft was dug too deep, the water turned brackish, and the scheme has to be abandoned.http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pbtyc/Portland/PYB/Water_Supply.html The shaft, 200 feet deep, still remains underground today.http://www.geoffkirby.co.uk/Portland/680700/ Southwell retained its small community throughout the 19th century. In 1879, the Avalanche Memorial Church, also known as the Church of St Andrew, was built within the village. At the turn of the 20th-century, some of the village's surrounding fields would be destroyed by inland quarrying. Despite this there are remaining examples between the village, and Portland Bill.http://www.geoffkirby.co.uk/Portland/680690/ With the outbreak of World War II, a number of heavy anti-aircraft batteries were constructed to protect Portland's naval base, and Portland's HAA \\"C Battery\\" was built to the western outskirts of the village, at Barrow Hill.http://www.geoffkirby.co.uk/PortlandArchivePictures/html/world_war_2.html Following the war, the battery was retained as an Off-Site Nucleus Force Battery, though it was demolished a few years later. At the beginning of the Cold War, the Admiralty selected Barrow Hill to build a new Admiralty Gunnery Establishment. In 1959 it became part of the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment (AUWE).http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C2010 The establishment became infamous for the discovery of a Soviet spy ring that operated from the late 1950s until 1961 when the core of the network was arrested by the British security services.http://www.theheritagecoast.co.uk/historyfile/portland_and_weymouth/deadly_weapons/portland_spies.htm The establishment closed in the 1990s when the navy left Portland, and it became the Southwell Business Park in 1997.http://www.dorsetlife.co.uk/2008/10/a-portland-success-story/ Throughout the 20th-century Southwell continued to remain a rural community, until the 1960s when major expansion saw many large housing and bungalow estates established. In the 1980s hundreds of starter homes were also built in the village. During 2002‚Äì03, both the Sweethill estate and the fields north of Southwell Business Park were developed. Features Like many of the other villages on Portland, Southwell has commercial businesses, namely within the Southwell Business Park. Aside from the park, the Eight Kings pub remains the only commercial business within the village. The village had one Primary School, Southwell County Primary School. In the south of the village remains the sewerage pumping station, which was originally built in the late 1980s. A small part of the Southwell Business Park The Southwell Business Park is located to the south-west of Southwell village. Once the AUWE site was closed in the 1990s, it then became the successful Southwell Business Park, used for commercial purposes. The park provided employment for almost 500 people and became home to over 100 businesses. In 2010, the park was under new ownership, where Compass Point Estates bought the park from KPMG after going into administrative receivership. In September 2016, part of the site will be home to the Isle of Portland Aldridge Community Academy's ¬£14 million campus, after an appeal overturned the decision of Weymouth and Portland Borough Council's planning committee to refuse permission for the build at Maritime House. The park is also the site of the Ocean Hotel, once known as the Portland Hotel, the Venue Hotel and the Ocean Hotel and Spa. Grade listed features The Avalanche Memorial Church Southwell has a wide array of architecture and buildings, a number of which are Grade Listed. 23 Southwell Street, and the garden wall attached to the west of 47 Southwell Street are Grade II listed. The Avalanche Memorial Church has also Grade II Listed, along with its boundary wall, since September 1978. A small Methodist Chapel, named Southwell Methodist Chapel, dating from 1849, is also Grade II listed. The surrounding fields between Portland Bill and Southwell are made up of an ancient strip field system. These particular fields remain untouched from housing or quarrying. Aside from the fields attached to the Culverwell Mesolithic Site near Portland Bill, two separate open fields have been also been scheduled under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. One of these is located just south of Southwell village.

For a quantum-mechanical system described by a density matrix , the von Neumann entropy is : S = - \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\rho \\\\ln \\\\rho), where \\\\operatorname{tr} denotes the trace and ln denotes the (natural) matrix logarithm. If is written in terms of its eigenvectors 1\\\\rangle, 2\\\\rangle, 3\\\\rangle, \\\\dots as : \\\\rho = \\\\sum_j \\\\eta_j \\\\left j \\\\right\\\\rang \\\\left\\\\lang j \\\\right ~, then the von Neumann entropy is merely : S = -\\\\sum_j \\\\eta_j \\\\ln \\\\eta_j . In this form, S can be seen as the information theoretic Shannon entropy. The von Neumann entropy is also used in different forms (conditional entropies, relative entropies, etc.) in the framework of quantum information theory to characterize the entropy of entanglement.  Background  John von Neumann established a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics in his 1932 work Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics.; In it, he provided a theory of measurement, where the usual notion of wave-function collapse is described as an irreversible process (the so-called von Neumann or projective measurement). The density matrix was introduced, with different motivations, by von Neumann and by Lev Landau. The motivation that inspired Landau was the impossibility of describing a subsystem of a composite quantum system by a state vector. On the other hand, von Neumann introduced the density matrix in order to develop both quantum statistical mechanics and a theory of quantum measurements. The density matrix formalism, thus developed, extended the tools of classical statistical mechanics to the quantum domain. In the classical framework, the probability distribution and partition function of the system allows us to compute all possible thermodynamic quantities. Von Neumann introduced the density matrix to play the same role in the context of quantum states and operators in a complex Hilbert space. The knowledge of the statistical density matrix operator would allow us to compute all average quantum entities in a conceptually similar, but mathematically different, way. Let us suppose we have a set of wave functions Œ®„Äâ that depend parametrically on a set of quantum numbers n1, n2, ..., nN. The natural variable which we have is the amplitude with which a particular wavefunction of the basic set participates in the actual wavefunction of the system. Let us denote the square of this amplitude by p(n1, n2, ..., nN). The goal is to turn this quantity p into the classical density function in phase space. We have to verify that p goes over into the density function in the classical limit, and that it has ergodic properties. After checking that p(n1, n2, ..., nN) is a constant of motion, an ergodic assumption for the probabilities p(n1, n2, ..., nN) makes p a function of the energy only. After this procedure, one finally arrives at the density matrix formalism when seeking a form where p(n1, n2, ..., nN) is invariant with respect to the representation used. In the form it is written, it will only yield the correct expectation values for quantities which are diagonal with respect to the quantum numbers n1, n2, ..., nN. Expectation values of operators which are not diagonal involve the phases of the quantum amplitudes. Suppose we encode the quantum numbers n1, n2, ..., nN into the single index i or j. Then our wave function has the form : \\\\left \\\\Psi \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\,=\\\\, \\\\sum_i a_i\\\\, \\\\left \\\\psi_i \\\\right\\\\rangle . The expectation value of an operator B which is not diagonal in these wave functions, so : \\\\left\\\\langle B \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\,=\\\\, \\\\sum_{i,j} a_i^{*}a_j\\\\, \\\\left\\\\langle i \\\\right B \\\\left j \\\\right\\\\rangle . The role which was originally reserved for the quantities \\\\left a_i \\\\right ^2 is thus taken over by the density matrix of the system S. : \\\\left\\\\langle j \\\\right \\\\, \\\\rho \\\\, \\\\left i \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\,=\\\\, a_j \\\\, a_i^{*} . Therefore, „ÄàB„Äâ reads : \\\\left\\\\langle B \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\,=\\\\, \\\\operatorname{tr} (\\\\rho B) ~. The invariance of the above term is described by matrix theory. A mathematical framework was described where the expectation value of quantum operators, as described by matrices, is obtained by taking the trace of the product of the density operator \\\\hat{\\\\rho} and an operator \\\\hat{B} (Hilbert scalar product between operators). The matrix formalism here is in the statistical mechanics framework, although it applies as well for finite quantum systems, which is usually the case, where the state of the system cannot be described by a pure state, but as a statistical operator \\\\hat{\\\\rho} of the above form. Mathematically, \\\\hat{\\\\rho} is a positive-semidefinite Hermitian matrix with unit trace. Definition Given the density matrix œÅ, von Neumann defined the entropyGeometry of Quantum States: An Introduction to Quantum Entanglement, by Ingemar Bengtsson, Karol ≈ªyczkowski, p301 as :S(\\\\rho) \\\\,=\\\\,-\\\\operatorname{tr} (\\\\rho \\\\ln \\\\rho), which is a proper extension of the Gibbs entropy (up to a factor ) and the Shannon entropy to the quantum case. To compute S(œÅ) it is convenient (see logarithm of a matrix) to compute the eigendecomposition of ~\\\\rho = \\\\sum_j \\\\eta_j \\\\left j \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\left\\\\langle j \\\\right . The von Neumann entropy is then given by :S(\\\\rho) \\\\,=\\\\, - \\\\sum_j \\\\eta_j \\\\ln \\\\eta_j ~. Since, for a pure state, the density matrix is idempotent, , the entropy S(œÅ) for it vanishes. Thus, if the system is finite (finite-dimensional matrix representation), the entropy S(œÅ) quantifies the departure of the system from a pure state. In other words, it codifies the degree of mixing of the state describing a given finite system. Measurement decoheres a quantum system into something noninterfering and ostensibly classical; so, e.g., the vanishing entropy of a pure state \\\\Psi = ( \\\\left 0 \\\\right\\\\rangle + \\\\left 1 \\\\right\\\\rangle ) / \\\\sqrt{2}, corresponding to a density matrix :\\\\rho = {1\\\\over 2} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} increases to for the measurement outcome mixture :\\\\rho = {1\\\\over 2} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} as the quantum interference information is erased. Properties Some properties of the von Neumann entropy: * is zero if and only if represents a pure state. * is maximal and equal to for a maximally mixed state, being the dimension of the Hilbert space. * is invariant under changes in the basis of , that is, , with a unitary transformation. * is concave, that is, given a collection of positive numbers which sum to unity (\\\\Sigma_i \\\\lambda_i = 1) and density operators , we have :: S\\\\bigg(\\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\lambda_i \\\\, \\\\rho_i \\\\bigg) \\\\,\\\\geq\\\\, \\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\lambda_i \\\\, S(\\\\rho_i). * satisfies the bound :: S\\\\bigg(\\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\lambda_i \\\\, \\\\rho_i \\\\bigg) \\\\,\\\\leq\\\\, \\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\lambda_i \\\\, S(\\\\rho_i) - \\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\lambda_i \\\\log \\\\lambda_i. :where equality is achieved if the have orthogonal support, and as before are density operators and is a collection of positive numbers which sum to unity (\\\\Sigma_i \\\\lambda_i = 1) * is additive for independent systems. Given two density matrices describing independent systems A and B, we have ::S(\\\\rho_A \\\\otimes \\\\rho_B)=S(\\\\rho_A)+S(\\\\rho_B). * is strongly subadditive for any three systems A, B, and C: ::S(\\\\rho_{ABC}) + S(\\\\rho_{B}) \\\\leq S(\\\\rho_{AB}) + S(\\\\rho_{BC}). :This automatically means that is subadditive: ::S(\\\\rho_{AC}) \\\\leq S(\\\\rho_{A}) +S(\\\\rho_{C}). Below, the concept of subadditivity is discussed, followed by its generalization to strong subadditivity. =Subadditivity= If are the reduced density matrices of the general state , then : \\\\left S(\\\\rho_A)\\\\,-\\\\,S(\\\\rho_B) \\\\right \\\\,\\\\leq \\\\, S(\\\\rho_{AB}) \\\\, \\\\leq \\\\, S(\\\\rho_A)\\\\,+\\\\,S(\\\\rho_B) ~. This right hand inequality is known as subadditivity. The two inequalities together are sometimes known as the triangle inequality. They were proved in 1970 by Huzihiro Araki and Elliott H. Lieb.Huzihiro Araki and Elliott H. Lieb, Entropy Inequalities, Communications in Mathematical Physics, vol 18, 160-170 (1970). While in Shannon's theory the entropy of a composite system can never be lower than the entropy of any of its parts, in quantum theory this is not the case, i.e., it is possible that , while . Intuitively, this can be understood as follows: In quantum mechanics, the entropy of the joint system can be less than the sum of the entropy of its components because the components may be entangled. For instance, as seen explicitly, the Bell state of two spin-¬Ωs, : \\\\left \\\\psi \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left \\\\uparrow \\\\downarrow \\\\right\\\\rangle + \\\\left \\\\downarrow \\\\uparrow \\\\right\\\\rangle , is a pure state with zero entropy, but each spin has maximum entropy when considered individually in its reduced density matrix. The entropy in one spin can be \\"cancelled\\" by being correlated with the entropy of the other. The left-hand inequality can be roughly interpreted as saying that entropy can only be cancelled by an equal amount of entropy. If system and system have different amounts of entropy, the smaller can only partially cancel the greater, and some entropy must be left over. Likewise, the right-hand inequality can be interpreted as saying that the entropy of a composite system is maximized when its components are uncorrelated, in which case the total entropy is just a sum of the sub-entropies. This may be more intuitive in the phase space formulation, instead of Hilbert space one, where the Von Neumann entropy amounts to minus the expected value of the ‚òÖ-logarithm of the Wigner function, , up to an offset shift. Up to this normalization offset shift, the entropy is majorized by that of its classical limit. =Strong subadditivity= The von Neumann entropy is also strongly subadditive. Given three Hilbert spaces, A, B, C, :S(\\\\rho_{ABC}) \\\\, + \\\\, S(\\\\rho_{B}) \\\\, \\\\leq \\\\, S(\\\\rho_{AB}) \\\\,+\\\\, S(\\\\rho_{BC}). This is a more difficult theorem and was proved first by J. Kiefer in 1959 and independently by Elliott H. Lieb and Mary Beth Ruskai in 1973,Elliott H. Lieb and Mary Beth Ruskai, Proof of the Strong Subadditivity of Quantum-Mechanical Entropy, Journal of Mathematical Physics, vol 14, 1938-1941 (1973). using a matrix inequality of Elliott H. LiebElliott H. Lieb, Convex Trace Functions and the Wigner-Yanase-Dyson Conjecture, Advances in Mathematics, vol 67, 267-288 (1973). proved in 1973. By using the proof technique that establishes the left side of the triangle inequality above, one can show that the strong subadditivity inequality is equivalent to the following inequality. :S(\\\\rho_{A}) \\\\, + \\\\, S(\\\\rho_{C}) \\\\, \\\\leq \\\\, S(\\\\rho_{AB}) \\\\,+\\\\, S(\\\\rho_{BC}) when , etc. are the reduced density matrices of a density matrix . If we apply ordinary subadditivity to the left side of this inequality, and consider all permutations of A, B, C, we obtain the triangle inequality for : Each of the three numbers is less than or equal to the sum of the other two.

Quadricyclane‚Äôs relative stability and high energy content have also given rise to its use as a propellant additive or fuel. However, quadricyclane undergoes thermal decomposition at relatively low temperatures (less than 400 ¬∞C). This property limits its applications, as propulsion systems may operate at temperatures exceeding 500 ¬∞C. Preparation Quadricyclane is produced by the irradiation of norbornadiene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene) in the presence of Michler's ketone or ethyl Michler's ketone.Cahill, P; Steppel, R.

He serves on the board of a number of private and public sector organisations, including chairing the board of Amey PLC. He is a Visiting Professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science and member of the Advisory Board of LSE IDEAS. He is a trustee of the Royal Anniversary Trust, which oversees The Queen's Anniversary Prizes for Higher and Further Education. Education and early career Mottram was educated at King Edward VI Camp Hill School in Birmingham. He entered the central government civil service in 1968 aged 22 with a first class degree in International relations from Keele University. Most of his peers were from Oxbridge. From 1975 until 1977, he served in the Defence and Overseas Secretariat of the Cabinet Office. He was then the secretary of two study groups on the rationale for and system options for a successor to the UK's strategic nuclear deterrent which led subsequently to the decision to adopt Trident. He was then appointed private secretary to the permanent under secretary, MOD: Sir Frank Cooper. From 1982-1986, he was private secretary to a succession of Secretaries of State for Defence - John Nott, Michael Heseltine and the late George Younger. He was Heseltine's Private Secretary at the time of his resignation in 1986 over the Westland affair. In 1985, as private secretary to Michael Heseltine, the Secretary of State at the Ministry of Defence, he was a witness for the prosecution in the trial of Clive Ponting, who was later acquitted of an offence under section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 for passing information to Labour MP Tam Dalyell about the sinking of the Belgrano during the Falklands war. When asked whether answers to parliamentary questions should be truthful and not deliberately ambiguous or misleading, there was a long silence before he replied: \\"In highly charged political matters, one person's ambiguity may be another person's truth\\". From 1986 to 1989, he was the Under-secretary responsible for the defence programme, and from 1989 to 1992, the Deputy Secretary with responsibilities for UK defence policy and strategy, and defence relations with other countries at the time of the end of the Cold War. He was the architect of the \\"Options for Change' Defence Review. Multi- purpose Permanent Secretary After this, in 1992, he was appointed as a Permanent Secretary, first at the Office of Public Service and Science in the Cabinet Office. His responsibilities there included public service change, Civil Service management questions, and science and technology policy and the science budget. In 1995, he became Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Defence, where he worked on, among other things, the Labour Government's Strategic Defence Review. In 1998, he became permanent secretary at the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. Mottram's tenure at DETR saw important developments in environmental policy and the publication of White papers on Urban and rural policy. A 10-year transport plan was developed building on the 1998 White paper on Integrated transport. One aspect of transport ‚Äî railways ‚Äî tended to dominate in the media. New institutional arrangements were introduced with a Strategic Rail Authority alongside the Rail Regulator but the appointments by John Prescott of Sir Alastair Morton as chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority and Tom Winsor as Rail Regulator proved an unhappy partnership, which ended in 2001 when Morton resigned and was replaced by Richard Bowker. Mottram's term also saw the rail crashes at Ladbroke Grove, Hatfield and Potters Bar. The national railway infrastructure company Railtrack got into serious financial difficulties after the Hatfield rail crash in October 2000, and on 7 October 2001 was put into administration on the petition of the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions Stephen Byers MP in very controversial circumstances. Mottram was closely involved in the preparations for the administration of Railtrack and in July 2005 was called as a witness in the largest class legal action ever brought in the English courts, when 49,500 shareholders of Railtrack sued the Secretary of State for Transport for damages for misfeasance in public office. The case was lost because the shareholders could not prove targeted malice on the part of Stephen Byers, that is an intention maliciously to injure the shareholders. Mottram's evidence was not contested by the claimants. In his summing up the judge referred to him as a \\"direct, accurate and truthful\\" witness. On 11 September 2001, after both World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon were hit in the day's terrorist attacks, a special advisor in Mottram's department, Jo Moore, sent an email to the press office of her department which read: \\"It's now a very good day to get out anything we want to bury. Councillors' expenses?\\" The suggestion caused severe criticism for its insensitivity, callousness and political ineptitude. As the administrative head of the department in which Moore worked, Mottram was asked by Stephen Byers to consider whether disciplinary action should be taken against Moore. Mottram was still at the DETR in 2002 when, after further controversy over alleged \\"burying of bad news\\" involving Moore and Martin Sixsmith, the department's Director of Communications, Stephen Byers announced that both Moore and Sixsmith had decided to resign. Mottram was in the middle of negotiations with Sixsmith at the time of the Byers announcement. According to Sixsmith he said to a colleague as Byers headed to the interview studios: After Sixmith included this quote in an interview with the Sunday Times about his \\"resignation\\" it was picked up extensively in the media and tended to be reported in bowdlerised form as \\"f***ed\\", leading Tony Wright, the Chairman of the Public Administration Committee at the time, to comment to Mottram that \\"Our note-takers have trouble with asterisks.\\"Public Administration Committee, Minutes of Evidence, 7 March 2002, Q178 Sir Richard was embarrassed by the report of his remarks, and was asked about them by the House of Commons Public Administration Committee on 7 March 2002. In response, he said: \\"I find the subject of the remarks I am alleged to have made with the asterisks one of the most tedious subjects I have ever had to deal with ... What is actually the case is that much to my regret, actually, these remarks appeared in the newspapers, they were uttered in private to one person, with one other person in the room and they were quite clearly over the top in a number of respects, not least in describing the nature of the crisis we were engulfed in. In previous incarnations I have dealt with life and death matters where lots of people lives were at risk. I have been responsible for things to do with nuclear warfare and whatever one thinks about the events of that Friday they are not in that category. I much regret the thing was so over-hyped.\\"Q231 Sir Richard has worked closely with a large number of Ministers and took the impartiality and professionalism of the civil service very seriously. His efforts to communicate the nature of this relationship were not, however, always successful. In his oral evidence to the House of Commons Public Administration Committee on 7 March 2002,Q346 he said He later said that he realised that this analogy was a \\"tremendous mistake\\".Note by Witness, same report In May 2002, as Stephen Byers resigned as secretary of state, Mottram was moved to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) as permanent secretary. In his time at DWP, a number of innovative policies were introduced on welfare to work and pensions and the department agreed to achieve staff reductions of 40,000 posts against a starting point of 130,000 staff (full- time equivalents), much the largest efficiency-related staff saving within central government. By the time Mottram left DWP, implementation of this saving was well underway. Sir Richard moved to a strategic position at the Cabinet Office on 11 November 2005 as Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator (still as a permanent secretary and also as a safe pair of hands with wide experience across government). He succeeded Bill Jeffrey. He also took on the role of Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee. His post was subsequently retitled as Permanent Secretary Intelligence, Security, and Resilience, Cabinet Office. In this role he acted as the Accounting Officer for the Single Intelligence Account, from which the three Security and Intelligence Agencies are funded. He also acted as Deputy Chair of the Civil Contingencies Committee, supporting the Prime Minister, Home Secretary and other Ministers in their role as Chair and, in the event of any serious incident requiring central government coordination, acting as the Government's senior Crisis Manager. He was also responsible for co-ordination of the Government's counter-terrorism policy and programmes. He was made chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee at time when the credibility of the organisation needed to be re-established after intelligence reports were apparently \\"sexed- up\\" for PR purposes during the chairmanship of John Scarlett. The JIC's role had come under scrutiny in the review of the information about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the Hutton Inquiry into the suicide of MoD weapons expert, Dr. David Kelly. Sir Richard retired from the Civil Service in November 2007 when the responsibilities he held were reorganised into two posts, with the Cabinet Secretary taking on the Accounting Officer role for the Intelligence Agencies. Other roles Sir Richard served as a Board Member and then from 2002-04 President of the Commonwealth Association for Public Administration and Management. From 2008-2014 he was chairman of the Defence Science and Technology LaboratoryDstl. He was a Board Member of Ashridge Business School from 1998- 2015.

Biography  = Early life and sea career = Fleet was born in Liverpool on 15 October 1887. He never knew his father, and his mother abandoned him and fled with a boyfriend to Springfield, Massachusetts, in the United States never to be seen or heard from again. Frederick was raised by a succession of foster families and distant relatives. In 1903 he went to sea as a deck boy, working his way up to able seaman.Stories from The Titanic, National Archives UK. Before joining the crew of the RMS Titanic he had sailed for over four years as a lookout in the RMS Oceanic. As a seaman, Fleet earned five pounds per month plus an extra 5 shillings for lookout duty. It was as a lookout that Fleet joined the Titanic in April 1912, along with five other watchmen. =R.M.S. Titanic= This iceberg was pictured in the morning of 15 April 1912 and is thought to be the one that the Titanic had struck.The crow's nest from which Fleet and Lee spotted the iceberg can be seen in the picture. Fleet boarded the Titanic in Southampton on 10 April 1912. The ship made two stops, first in Cherbourg, France and Queenstown, in Ireland. The lookouts, six in total, made two-hour shifts due to extreme cold in the crow's nest. The trip was uneventful until the night of 14 April 1912. At 22:00 (10 p.m.) that night, Fleet and his fellow lookout Reginald Lee replaced George Symons and Archie Jewell at the nest. They passed on the order given earlier to them by second officer Charles Lightoller to watch out for small ice. The night was calm and moonless, which made it difficult to spot the icebergs due to the lack of waves breaking against the base of the iceberg and reflection. Furthermore, despite Fleet and his fellow lookouts having repeatedly requested being provided with binoculars,historicsouthampton.wordpress.com/encyclopedia- titanica.org they were not available for the lookouts. It is sometimes attributed to the last-minute change in the hierarchy of the ship when officer David Blair was replaced by Henry Tingle Wilde, without Blair mentioning where the binoculars had been located. It has been also mentioned that Blair accidentally took the keys of the cabinet containing the binoculars with him. Despite both inquiries into the disaster, nothing clarified why the lookouts were not provided with binoculars, though there are many explanations such as one that the White Star Line steamers' lookouts did not particularly use them. Besides, some experts have said that even using binoculars, neither Fleet nor Lee could have spotted the iceberg any sooner given the conditions of the night.10 causes of the Titanic tragedy, NBC news. At 23:39 (11:39 p.m.), Fleet first spotted the iceberg and rang the nest's bell three times to warn the bridge of something ahead. Then, using the nest's telephone, he contacted the bridge. It was answered only a few seconds later by sixth officer James Paul Moody, who asked Fleet immediately, \\"What did you see?\\" He pronounced the infamous \\"Iceberg! Right Ahead!\\" warning to Moody. Moody acknowledged Fleet's warning, and immediately notified first officer William McMaster Murdoch; in charge of the bridge. After the collision, Fleet and Lee remained on duty for twenty more minutes.Fred Fleet did his duty on Titanic, now resting in peace, Herald Dispatch. RMS Carpathia; Fleet can be seen trying to tie the boat to the davits of the ship. At 00:00 (12 a.m.), Fleet and Lee were relieved by Alfred Frank Evans and George Hogg. Fleet went down to boat deck and helped to prepare Lifeboat No. 6. Minutes later, when the boat was already prepared, second officer Lightoller put quartermaster Robert Hichens in charge of the lifeboat and ordered Fleet aboard as well. As they were lowered away, Hichens and American socialite Margaret Brown realized there were only two sailors to man the boat, including Fleet and called for another sailor to be sent. As no able seaman was near, Canadian Colonel Arthur Godfrey Peuchen volunteered to join the boat saying he had experience in sailing. He was ordered by Lightoller to reach the boat by climbing down a rope, which he did successfully. Once away from the sinking ship, the boat tried to reach the lights of a ship in the distance, thought to be the SS Californian. While Hichens remained at the tiller, Fleet and Peuchen managed the oars. Arguments and problems arose on boat 6 as quartermaster Hichens kept insulting and mistreating the rowers, including Margaret Brown and Helen Churchill Candee. Later in the night, there was an argument on whether to return for survivors, with Hichens warning against returning saying they would be swamped by swimmers. The lifeboat finally reached the RMS Carpathia by 6:00 a.m. on Monday, 15 April 1912. After the disaster, Fleet underwent two inquiries; first, the U.S. Inquiry and then the British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry. In the United States, he was inquired by Senator William Alden Smith, to whom he repeatedly said that had they been equipped with binoculars, the disaster wouldn't have happened. Before the British Inquiry, he underwent a long examination, often repetitive, for which he refused to answer many of the questions. Lord Mersey, Chairman of the Commission concluded Fleet's interrogation by telling him that he was grateful for his willingness to answer questions despite his wariness when responding to every question. Fleet replied with a sarcastic \\"Thanks.\\" =World Wars and later life= Fleet served in the Titanics sister ship RMS Olympic before leaving the White Star Line in August 1912 after noticing that the company treated those involved with the Titanic differently - in an attempt to forgive what had happened. For the next 24 years he sailed for different shipping companies, including the Union-Castle Line. Fleet served on merchant ships throughout World War I.

Cynan was the son of Rhodri Molwynog and ascended to the throne of Gwynedd upon the death of King Caradog ap Meirion in 798. His epithet refers to the commote of Dindaethwy in the cantref Rhosyr. Unlike later kings of Gwynedd, usually resident at Aberffraw in western Anglesey, Cynan maintained his court at Llanfaes on the southeastern coast., A History of Wales, Vol I Cynan's reign was marked by a destructive dynastic power struggle with a rival named Hywel, usually supposed to be his brother. There is no historical record of Cynan's early years as king, but his reign ended in a combination of natural disasters and military reverses. In 810, there was a bovine plague that killed many cattle throughout Wales. The next year Deganwy, the ancient wooden court of Maelgwn Gwynedd, was struck by lightning. A destructive war between Cynan and Hywel raged on Anglesey between 812 and 816, ultimately ending with Cynan's defeat and banishment. Cynan and Hywel are said to be brothers in historical works such as Lloyd's History of Wales,, A History of Wales although Lloyd does not cite its source. The Annals of Wales mention the pair only by name, without any title, relation, or patronym., Annales Cambriae (In comparison, it takes care to point out the brotherly nature of Elisedd's slaughter of Gruffydd ap Cyngen in Powys around the same time.)

As it took place at Cynan's court, it could as easily have been a struggle between Hywel and remnants of Cynan's supporters.

The kontakion originated in the Byzantine Empire around the sixth century CE. It is divided into strophes (oikoi, stanzas) and begins with a prologue (the prooimoion or koukoulion). The kontakion usually has a biblical theme, and often features dialogue between biblical characters. By far the most important writer of kontakia is Romanos the Melodist. The only kontakion that is regularly celebrated in full length today is the Akathist to the Theotokos. Etymology The word 'kontakion' derives from the Greek Œ∫œåŒΩœÑŒ±Œæ (kontax), which means 'rod' or 'stick' and refers specifically to the pole around which a scroll is wound. The term describes the way in which the words on a scroll unfurl as it is read. The word was originally used to describe an early Byzantine poetic form, whose origins date back certainly as far as the sixth century CE, and possibly earlier. Nevertheless, the term itself is of ninth-century origin. There is also a chant book named after the hymn genre kontakion, the kontakarion () or kondakar (). The kontakarion is not just a collection of kontakia: within the tradition of the Cathedral Rite (like the rite practiced at the Hagia Sophia of Constantinople) it became the name of the book of the prechanter or lampadarios, also known as \\"psaltikon\\", which contained all the soloistic parts of hymns sung during the morning service and the Divine Liturgy. Because the kontakia were usually sung by protopsaltes during the morning services, the first part for the morning service with its prokeimena and kontakia was the most voluminous part, so it was simply called kontakarion. Icon of St. Romanos the Melodist chanting his kontakion (1649, Malaryta, Belarus). History Originally the kontakion was a Syriac form of poetry which became popular in Constantinople under Romanos the Melodist, Anastasios and Kyriakos during the 6th century and was continued by Sergius I of Constantinople and Sophronius of Jerusalem during the 7th century. Romanos' works had been widely acknowledged as a crucial contribution to Byzantine hymnography, in some kontakia he did also support Emperor Justinian by writing state propaganda.Concerning the inauguration of the Hagia Sophia, see Johannes Koder (2008). Romanos' kontakion On the Nativity of Christ was also mentioned in his vita. Until the twelfth century, it was sung every year at the imperial banquet on that feast by the joint choirs of Hagia Sophia and of the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. Most of the poem takes the form of a dialogue between the Mother of God and the Magi.The Magis' visit to the newborn Child is celebrated in the Orthodox Church on 25 December rather than on 6 January (the Feast of the Theophany on 6 January celebrates the Baptism of Christ in the Orthodox Church). A kontakion is a poetic form frequently encountered in Byzantine hymnography. It was probably based on Syriac hymnographical traditions, which were transformed and developed in Greek-speaking Byzantium. It was a homiletic genre and could be best described as a \\"sermon in verse accompanied by music\\". In character it is similar to the early Byzantine festival sermons in prose ‚Äî a genre developed by Ephrem the Syrian ‚Äî but meter and music have greatly heightened the drama and rhetorical beauty of the speaker‚Äôs often profound and very rich meditation. Medieval manuscripts preserved about 750 kontakia since the 9th century, about two thirds had been composed since the 10th century, but they were rather liturgical compositions with about two or six oikoi, each one concluded by a refrain identical to the introduction (prooimion). Longer compositions were the Slavic Akafist which were inspired by an acrostic kontakion whose 24 stanzas started with each letter of the alphabet (Akathist). Within the cathedral rite developed a truncated which reduced the kontakion to one oikos or just to the prooimion, while the music was elaborated to a melismatic style. The classical repertoire consisted of 42 kontakia-idiomela, and 44 kontakia-prosomoia made about a limited number of model stanzas consisting of fourteen prooimia-idiomela and thirteen okoi- idiomela which could be combined independently. This classical repertoire was dominated by classical composers of the 6th and 7th centuries. Form The form generally consists of 18 to 24 metrically identical stanzas called oikoi (‚Äúhouses‚Äù), preceded, in a different meter, by a short prelude, called a koukoulion (cowl) or prooimoion. The first letters of each of the stanzas form an acrostic, which frequently includes the name of the poet. For example, Romanos' poems often include the acrostic \\"Of the Humble Romanos\\" or \\"The Poem of the Humble Romanos\\". The last line of the prelude introduces a refrain called ‚Äúephymnion‚Äù, which is repeated at the end of all the stanzas. The main body of a kontakion was chanted from the ambo by a cleric (often a deacon; otherwise a reader) after the reading of the Gospel, while a choir, or even the whole congregation, joined in the refrain. The length of many kontakia ‚Äî indeed, the epic character of some ‚Äî suggest that the majority of the text must have been delivered in a kind of recitative, but unfortunately, the original music which accompanied the kontakia has now been lost. The liturgical place of the kontakion Within the cathedral rite, the ritual context of the long kontakion was the pannychis during solemn occasions (a festive night vigil) and was usually celebrated at the Blachernae Chapel.Alexander Lingas (1995). Assumptions that kontakia replaced canon poetry or vice versa that the Stoudites replaced the kontakia with Hagiopolitan canon poetry, always remained controversial. The Patriarch Germanus I of Constantinople established an own local school earlier (even if it is no longer present in the modern books), while the Stoudites embraced the genre kontakion with own new compositions. The only explanation is that different customs must have existed simultaneously, the truncated and the long kontakion, but also the ritual context of both customs. The truncated form consisted only of the first stanza called \\"koukoulion\\" (now referred to as \\"the kontakion\\") and the first oikos, while the other oikoi became omitted. Within the Orthros for the kontakion and oikos is after the sixth ode of the canon; however, if the typikon for the day calls for more than one kontakion at matins, the kontakion and oikos of the more significant feast is sung after the sixth ode, while those of the less significant feast are transferred to the place following the third ode, before the kathismata.Liturgics , section \\"The Singing of the Troparia and Kontakia\\", Retrieved 2012-01-17–¢v–ø–∏–∫–æÃÅ–Ω—ä, p 7, 11, 12, etc. Since the late 13th century, when the Court and the Patriarchate returned from exile in Nikaia, the former cathedral rite was not continued and thus, also the former celebration of kontakion changed. The only entire kontakion celebrated was the Akathist hymn. Its original place was within the menaion the feast of Annunciation (25 March). In later kontakaria and oikemataria which treated all 24 oikoi in a kalophonic way, the Akathist was written as part of the triodion, within the oikematarion the complete kontakion filled half the volume of the whole book.See the Oikematarion written at Mone Esphigmenou (ET-MSsc Ms. Sin. gr. 1262, ff.67v-131r). As such it could only be performed in short sections throughout Great Lent and became a kind of para-liturgical genre. In the modern practice it is reduced to heirmologic melos which allowed the celebration of the whole Akathist on the morning service of the fourth Sunday of Great Lent.Liturgics , section \\"The Fourth Sunday of Lent\\", Retrieved 2012-01-17–¢v–ø–∏–∫–æÃÅ–Ω—ä, p 437 This Akathist was traditionally ascribed to Romanos, but recent scholarship has disapproved it. In Slavic hymnography the so-called Akafist became a genre of its own which was dedicated to various saints; while not part of any prescribed service, these may be prayed as a devotional hymn at any time. The current practice treats the kontakion as a proper troparion, based on the text of the prooimion, dedicated to a particular feast of the menaion or the moveable cycle. Prooimia of 4 classical kontakia The examples chosen here are only the introduction (prooimion, koukoulion) and they belong to the old core repertoire of 86 kontakia which had been all known as part of the cathedral rite. Thus, they can be found with notation in the kontakarion-psaltikon.See the edition by Constantin Floros (2015). According to the melodic system of the cathedral rite, certain kontakia-idiomela served as melodic models which had been used to compose other kontakia. The kontakion for Easter for instance was used to compose an Old Church Slavonic kondak in honour of the local saints Boris and Gleb, two martyre princes of the Kievan Rus. The concluding verse called ‚Äúephymnion‚Äù (·ºêœÜœçŒºŒΩŒπŒøŒΩ) was repeated like a refrain after each oikos and its melody was used in all kontakia composed in the echos plagios tetartos. Kontakion of Pascha (Easter) The Slavic kondakar has the old gestic notation which referred (in the first row) to the hand signs used by the choirleaders to coordinate the singers. Except for the ephymnion the whole prooimion and the oikoi were recited by a soloist called \\"monophonaris\\" (the hand sign were not so important than during the ephymnion). The Middle Byzantine notation used in the Greek kontakarion-psaltikon rather showed the melismatic melos behind these signs. RUS-SPsc Ms. Q.–ø.I.32, ET-MSsc Ms. Sin.

Accessed August 22, 2005. a Harrier Comics title which lasted eight issues. In issue #5 Campbell spun the character out of that book and into his own comic, the eponymous Bacchus, a book that lasted two issues, focusing the Deadface comic on Joe Theseus, an updated version of Theseus. When Harrier Comics ceased publication, Campbell managed to sell stories containing the character to numerous publishers; the American publisher Dark Horse, where the character appeared in their anthology title Dark Horse Presents, and who also collected the Deadface comics in the Deadface: Immortality Isn't Forever collection published November 1990; and two British publishers, Trident Comics, where the stories appeared in their black-and-white anthology, Trident, and Atomeka, appearing in A1, another black-and-white anthology. Dark Horse then collected these short stories and serialized them in comic book form as the three-issue mini-series Deadface: Doing The Islands With Bacchus (1991), as well as serializing the adventures of another character from the mythos, The Eyeball Kid (grandson of Argus \\"all eyes\\"), in the Dark Horse anthology Cheval Noir, which was later extended and repackaged as a three-issue mini-series, The Eyeball Kid in 1992. After these collections and repackaging, Dark Horse commissioned the new storyline, Deadface: Earth, Water, Air, & Fire, a four-issue mini-series published in 1992. Following this in May 1993 came 1,001 Nights of Bacchus, a single-issue comic book compilation of various other previously uncollected storylines which Campbell had placed with various publishers but which he had also created within a unified framing sequence. The next storylines related to the Bacchus mythos were again serialized, this time in Dark Horse Presents as Hermes vs the Eyeball Kid (1993-1994) and The Picture Of Doreen Grey (1995), the former also collected as a three-issue mini-series in 1994-1995. The final work in the Bacchus mythos to be published by Dark Horse was also the first time Bacchus appeared within a comic published in color, The Ghost In The Glass, published in 1995. At this point Campbell decided to self-publish his own comic, Eddie Campbell's Bacchus, in which he published two new storylines featuring Bacchus, King Bacchus and Banged Up, while concurrently revising and reprinting the material already published, and also adding new stories to the 1,001 Nights of Bacchus sequence. The Bacchus character's stories came to an end after the Banged Up storyline, and although Campbell eventually finished the reprinting of the previously published material, he continued publishing Eddie Campbell's Bacchus, updating the name to Eddie Campbell's Bacchus Magazine to reflect the growing number of text pieces he was running, before canceling the book with issue #60. Campbell also published these revised storylines in the graphic novel format in collaboration with the publisher Top Shelf.Internet Archive February 1 2003 version of Bacchus  Eddie Campbell Comics accessed August 22, 2005 =Creators= Campbell worked with numerous collaborators on the many series and appearances Bacchus made, beginning with Phil Elliott, whom Campbell approached to color the Deadface and Bacchus covers. Ed 'Ilya' Hillyer worked as inker on the last four issues of Deadface, before taking full art chores on The Eyeball Kid series initially serialized in Cheval Noir. Wes Kublick collaborated with the writing on some of the short stories which made up Deadface: Doing The Islands With Bacchus, and Stephen Bissette, Phil Elliott and Pete Mullins collaborated on the art on other stories in this sequence. (Mullins helping to redo Elliott's story, which was reworked and retitled.) Kublick again helped Campbell with the writing on the first two issues of the Deadface: Earth, Water, Air, & Fire series. 1,001 Nights of Bacchus saw collaborations on the writing front with Kublick, Marcus Moore, Daren White, and Mark Campbell, with Mark Campbell also writing one story in this sequence solely. Artistic collaborators on this sequence were Steve Stamatiadis, Dylan Horrocks, and Pete Mullins, who all collaborated on one story each. Hermes vs. The Eyeball Kid is credited as being written by Campbell and Kublick, and drawn by Campbell, Mullins, and April Post, with Mullins, again assisting with the art on the latter two-thirds of The Picture Of Doreen Grey. The Ghost In The Glass featured art by Teddy Kristiansen. Mullins again assisted on King Bacchus, with another credit for April Post on part 9. The final serial, Banged Up, saw Marcus Moore again assist with some of the stories and Mullins assist on almost all of the art with a little help from Steve Francis on part 8.Eddie Campbell's BACCHUS - The Web Comicography accessed July 26, 2014.

It is also referred to as Hungarian Pannonia, or Pannonian Hungary. Administrative divisions =Traditional interpretation= The borders of Transdanubia are the Danube River (north and east), the Drava and Mura rivers (south), and the foothills of the Alps roughly along the border between Hungary and Austria (west). Transdanubia comprises the counties of Gy≈ër-Moson- Sopron, Kom√°rom-Esztergom, Fej√©r, Veszpr√©m, Vas, Zala, Somogy, Tolna, Baranya and the part of Pest that lies west of the Danube. (In the early Middle Ages the latter was known as Pilis county.) This article deals with Transdanubia in this geographical meaning. =Territorial changes= Regions in Hungary. The three Transdanubian regions in the west are shown in red, orange, and lavender. While the northern, eastern and southern borders of the region are clearly marked by the Danube and Drava rivers, the western border was always identical with the political boundary of Hungary, therefore it was affected by the territorial changes of the 20th century. Before the Treaty of Trianon in 1920 the present-day regions of Burgenland, Prekmurje and Meƒëimurje were integral parts of Transdanubia. The three villages of Rusovce, Jarovce and ƒåunovo also belonged to Transdanubia before the Paris Peace Treaty in 1947. Transdanubia is essentially a Hungarian geographical concept so these areas ceased to be parts of it when they were annexed by neighbouring countries. =EU regions= Transdanubia is a NUTS territorial unit in the European Union, consisting of Central Transdanubia, Western Transdanubia and Southern Transdanubia (see NUTS:HU). Pest county and Budapest belong to the region of Central Hungary. It has an area of 37,000 km2 and a population of around 3.1 million. Geography Baranya County, Hungary 300px The territory of the region is 38,000 km¬≤, and it comprises almost half of the whole territory of Hungary. In therms of historical geography it also comprised major part of northern Pannonia, and thus the term Hungarian Pannonia refers to this region. The terrain is very varied with gentle hills, valleys, basins, mountains and plains. The main geographical formations are the Transdanubian Mountains, the southern half of the Little Alf√∂ld, the Alpokalja, the Transdanubian Hills, and the Mez≈ëf√∂ld (part of the Great Alf√∂ld). The main rivers are the Danube, Drava, R√°ba, Zala, and Kapos. In the middle of Transdanubia lies the biggest freshwater lake of Central Europe, the Lake Balaton. Other importants lakes are the Lake Velence and the Lake Fert≈ë. History Historically the counties of Transdanubia were Moson, Gy≈ër, Sopron, Vas, Zala, Veszpr√©m, Fej√©r, Kom√°rom, Esztergom, Somogy, Tolna and Baranya. They comprised the so called Districtus Trans-Danubianus from the beginnings of the 18th century. The boundaries of these counties, established by Stephen I of Hungary remained unchanged for almost 900 years until 1920. =Ancient history= Transdanubia has been populated since the Stone Age. Between 10 BCE and 434 CE, it was part of the Roman Empire. With some present-day Austrian and Croatian territories, it comprised the Province of Pannonia, a romanised, Latin-speaking border region with important Roman towns (Scarbantia, Aquincum, Sopianae, Gorsium, Savaria) and rural villas. =Middle Ages= In the Age of Migrations it was occupied by the Huns, Ostrogoths, Lombards, Gepids, Avars, Franks and the Slavic peoples. In 900 Pannonia was occupied by the Magyars and after 1000 became part of the Kingdom of Hungary. Transdanubia has been one of the most important regions of Hungary since the 11th century. Esztergom has been the ecclesiastical capital of the country since 1001 until today, and Stephen I of Hungary established his royal seat at Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, later the coronation town of the kings. Other important medieval cities were Veszpr√©m, P√©cs, Gy≈ër and Sopron. After the devastating Mongol invasion (see Mongol invasion of Europe) new castles were built, and King B√©la IV of Hungary established a new royal capital at Buda, next to the Danube. The region's rich medieval heritage is seen everywhere from the little village churches to the old castles, monasteries and town houses. =Early modern times= In the Ottoman era (16-17th centuries) the eastern and southern part of Transdanubia came under Turkish rule. The ever changing border ran along the Transdanubian Mountains and the southern shore of the Lake Balaton. The dangerous border was guarded by frontier-fortresses (v√©gv√°r), the most important of which were Gy≈ër and Nagykanizsa. The Asian-style Ottoman rule and the constant war had devastating effects: dozens of villages were destroyed, the population was decimated and parts of the region became almost totally deserted. The territories belonging to the Royal Hungary (except the border regions) were more lucky, because the European-like developments were continuous. Here the 17th century was the period of the Catholic Counter-reformation, the fights for national independence from the Habsburgs and the formation of a new, powerful Catholic aristocracy. In 1686 the allied Habsburg, Polish and Bavarian army reconquered Buda and terminated the Ottoman rule. In the 18th century the region was slowly rebuilt, and many new settlers (Magyars, Germans, Poles, Slovaks, and Croatians) arrived. Famous baroque castles were built to show the power of the big landowner families, for example the Esterh√°zys in Fert≈ëd and the Festetics in Keszthely. The baroque townscape of the cities survived until today in Gy≈ër, Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, P√©cs, etc. In the 19th century Trandanubia underwent a capitalist development. Due to its closeness of Austria it became again the richest part of the country, and ‚Äì at least after the public opinion ‚Äì more \\"European\\" and Western-like than any other region of Hungary or most regions of post-communist Central Europe. =Modern times= Dorog, a small industrial town Under the People's Republic of Hungary (1949‚Äì1989) new industrial cities were built at Tatab√°nya, Duna√∫jv√°ros, Ajka and Koml√≥, and new industries and factories were established, for example Hungary's only atomic power plant at Paks. In P√©cs uranium was mined and big industrial suburbs were built. One of the most famous plant of Socialist Hungary, the Ikarus Bus was established in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. After the fall of socialism, northern Transdanubia was more successful at adapting to the new economic situation than other parts of Hungary (except Budapest) and most of the foreign investment came here to help the radical economic renewal. In the 1990s Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r was counted as probably the economically most successful Hungarian town. Esztergom, Gy≈ër and Szentgotth√°rd became centers of the automobile industry with the establishment of the Suzuki, Audi and Opel factories. On the other hand, some rural regions remained impoverished, especially in Southern Transdanubia and along the River Drave.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1892 to 1907, and again from 1910 to 1915. McFadden was a Conservative, and served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Hugh John Macdonald and Rodmond Roblin. McFadden was born in Peterborough, Canada West (now Ontario), and educated in Bruce, Ontario. He received certification from the Ontario Veterinary College and practised as a veterinary surgeon. He also served as manager of the Alexandra Realty Co. in Emerson, Manitoba, and was active in municipal politics. In religion, McFadden was a Methodist. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1892 provincial election, defeating Liberal incumbent James Thomson by fourteen votes in the Emerson constituency. The Liberals won a majority government in this election, and McFadden served as an opposition member. He was one of only six Conservatives returned in the 1896 election, defeating candidates of the Liberals and the Patrons of Industry. McFadden was returned again for Emerson by an increased majority in the 1899 election. At the provincial level, the Conservatives won a majority government under the leadership of Hugh John Macdonald. The Conservative Party assumed office on January 10, 1900, and McFadden was appointed as Minister of Public Works and Provincial Secretary. When Rodmond Roblin replaced Macdonald as premier on December 20, 1900, he reassigned McFadden as Municipal Commissioner and Provincial Secretary. He was re-elected over Liberal George Walton in the 1903 election, and might have lost had the opposition vote not been split with a Prohibitionist candidate. In the 1907 election, Walton defeated McFadden by 105 votes. He resigned from cabinet on June 26, 1907. McFadden returned to the legislature in the 1910 election, defeating Walton by a margin of nine votes in Emerson. He was not re-appointed to cabinet and served as a backbench supporter of Roblin's administration. In the 1914 election, McFadden defeated Walton by thirty-two votes. In 1915, the Roblin administration was forced to resign from office after a report commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor found the government guilty of corruption in the tendering of contracts for new legislative buildings. A new election was called, in which the Liberal government won a landslide majority. McFadden did not seek re-election. He attempted to return to the legislature in the 1922 election, but lost to independent candidate Dmytro Yakimischak.

He carried out biomaterial work in artificial knees, hips, and dental prostheses. He served as president of Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology for 28 years. He was born at Adams Center, New York. Early Life Hulbert grew up in Adams Center New York, where he spent most of his time in extracurricular activities and helping out on his family's milk delivery business . Hulbert described helping the milk delivery business as difficult and busy . In part due to his enjoyment of being active and as an effort to cope, he engaged in a wide variety of school activities including: baseball, football, and basketball and believed that it increased his knowledge about how to interact with others and his confidence . Hulbert's passion for sports even led him to try out for the Philadelphia Phillies; the try out ended with his receiving a concussion as result of a lack of protection and a hit from a professional pitcher . While he was grateful for his family, he felt driven to set his own course away from the strenuous life style he grew up with and thus wanted to pursue higher education . He was influenced to go to Alfred University by his chemistry teacher, Lyle Cady, who showed him the campus and helped convince his parents to let him go there . Education Hulbert earned a B.S. in Ceramic Engineering in 1958 and a Ph.D. in Ceramic Science in 1964 both from Alfred University Career Hulbert joined the faculty of Clemson University in 1964, eventually becoming the Associate Dean for Engineering Research and Interdisciplinary Studies in 1970. During his time at Clemson, he along with C. Clifford Fain and Michael J. Eitel, was given a grant by the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate the viability of water disposable/biodegradable glass and conducted a multiple year study that culminated in a report made to the EPA in 1971 . 1973 he joined Tulane University as the Dean of Engineering. While at Tulane, Hulbert helped create their biomedical engineering program. Hulbert was President of Rose-Hulman, situated in Terre Haute, Indiana, from 1976 to 2004, also teaching bioengineering classes. During this period, student enrollment doubled, $90 million in new buildings were constructed, the endowment increased to $180 million, and the school became co-educational. A campaign raised $250 million. Rose-Hulman was ranked at the top of the U.S. News & World Report rankings of undergraduate engineering programs whose highest degree is a Bachelor's or Master's. He also became President of the Association of Independent Technological Universities, Chairman of the Second World Congress on Biomaterials, and Chairman of the 3rd International Symposium on Ceramics in Medicine, and founded the Society for Biomaterials.

The Sixteen's custom interior The car referenced the Cadillac V-16 of the 1930s. The actual design of the car was a combination of Cadillac's current \\"Art and Science\\" design theme and 1967 Cadillac Eldorado cues. Additional original design elements were provided by an in-house design competition led by GM Vice President Bob Lutz. The Sixteen has the Cadillac logo carved out of solid crystal on the steering wheel and a Bulgari clock on the dashboard. Although the Sixteen remained a concept car, its design language was implemented in Cadillac's subsequent vehicles, most noticeably on the 2008 Cadillac CTS. Since its unveiling there have been resurfacing rumors about a possible very limited production of an exclusive Cadillac halo model. A scaled-down version of the car, referred to as the ULS (Ultra Luxury Sedan) or XLS, with a standard V8 and an optional V12 (the latter was to be called the Cadillac Twelve), had been rumored for production since 2005, but was eventually shelved in favor of the Cadillac XTS. Ever since the Sixteen was first unveiled there have been resurfacing rumors, speculation and high hopes of automotive journalists and aficionados about a possible limited production of an exclusive Cadillac halo model, such as the Sixteen, to be the \\"ultimate flagship\\" of the brand and sit atop of the upcoming flagship, as previewed by the Ciel concept of late 2011.https://web.archive.org/web/20150320070234/http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/top- Cadillac-Sixteen-Concept.htmhttp://jalopnik.com/5833989/cadillac-keeps- breaking-my-heart In media It was on the episode of Ride with Funkmaster Flex at the 2003 New York International Auto Show.

The original lake was built by the Simpson family of Huntingdon as a hydroelectric project. The current Raystown Lake was completed in 1973 by the Army Corps of Engineers. Raystown is around deep in the deepest area near the dam. The lake was created primarily to control floods, provide electricity, and support recreational activities. Allegheny Electric Cooperative operates the Raystown Hydroelectric Project and William F. Matson Generating Station at the Raystown Dam, a 21 MW, two-unit hydroelectric project. Boating, swimming, mountain biking, scuba diving, and fishing are all popular activities. There are many campsites on the lake, as well as several boat launches, restaurants, and trails. Firework displays are held at the Raystown Lake Resort on Memorial Day Weekend, July 3, and the Sunday night before Labor Day. The fireworks at the resort are watched from the lake but can also be seen from the Pennsylvania Route 994 bridge; the resort is just south of this bridge. There are many recreational opportunities around Raystown Lake. Much of the surrounding land is owned by the Army Corps of Engineers and is not available for residential development; because of this summer homes were built near the lake rather than on the waterfront, and most of the lake remains undeveloped. This makes the experience of boating on the lake very different from many other lakes; the hills on the shores of the winding lake are blanketed right down to the water by the trees. Raystown has a fishery including largemouth bass, striped bass, smallmouth bass, muskellunge, walleye, pickerel, perch, calico bass, lake trout, rainbow trout, brook trout, brown trout, bluegill, catfish, carp, white bass, rock bass, salmon and shad. In 2015, a Texas-based energy company proposed building a large resort on the mountain above and marina with luxury amenities on the shore. Several Residents joined together in protest and the Proposal didn‚Äôt meet the criteria required by the USACE for ecological and safety reasons History Shy Beaver Boat Launch at Raystown Lake =First Raystown Dam= The development of the first Raystown Dam in 1905 conceived the starting point for a history in consequential dams which eventually led to the creation of Raystown Lake in 1972. It has been said that the original dam was the creation of George Ernest and Warren Brown Simpson. The formation of the idea had been recorded by the New Era Journal, October 12, 1905 in which it stated: \\"earlier in the year 1905 George Ernest Simpson and Warren Brown Simpson were fishing along the Branch. It was good water for bass at that time and their catch was very gratifying. Uncle Ernest, sometime during the day, said: 'W. B., this would make a fine location for a hydroelectric development.'\\" That idea took immediate fruit for they were both \\"promoters.\\" No one knows how much time and thought was put into the project idea, but eventually permanent charters for the development of the stream were granted by the Commonwealth and signed by Governor Pennypacker on March 30, 1906 (Drake, 1905). The 1905 Raystown Dam brought many changes for the Huntingdon area, physically and economically. The Raystown Dam was the first hydroelectric dam to be built on the Raystown Branch of the Juniata River and the construction process had fewer financial problems because it was a product of private instead of public enterprise. The December 9, 1989 edition of the Daily News stated, \\"The first power dam on the Raystown Branch was the product of private enterprise. It was conceived in 1906 when ten area men formed the Raystown Water Power Company. The corporation financed the construction of the dam, which took from 1907 to 1912 to build\\" (Shuck, 1989) The dam also brought a new diversity to the area in which Italian immigrants set up a small village and built the dam by hand and horsepower. This dam also started to open the area for vast cottage development, but with this came problems. \\"Almost a thousand cottages are near its shores, and the construction last year by the County Commissioners of Fink's Bridge opened up another large area for development. But right now all this area is in turmoil just because some people have started talking about a new high level dam for this area; completely cover all existing cottages and permanent homes. This has resulted in a condition of such unrest that the real estate value of the present area has been very seriously harmed\\" (Drake, 1905). Before the current Raystown Dam was constructed in 1972, the original dam underwent two purchases and one merger before it became the property of Pennsylvania Electric Company (Penelec) in 1946 (Shuck, 1989). This dam is now a popular diving site by local scuba divers. =Second Raystown Dam= The proposal for the new dam incorporated the ideas of bringing tourism into the area, promoting recreation, and flood control. The actual purpose stated, \\"The project will provide flood control, recreation, water quality and fish and wildlife enhancement\\" (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1974). Although tourism and recreation was what was projected as the most important to the public and community, the reason the dam was approved was for flood control. The project was authorized under the general provisions of the Flood Control Act of 1962 (Public Law 87-874, 87th Congress, second session). The dam has a flood storage capacity of , equivalent to about of runoff from the drainage area of above the dam, between elevations of 786 and 812 (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1965). \\"The project would reduce flood stages along the Juniata River at Mount Union, Lewistown, Mifflin, and Newport, Pennsylvania, and to a lesser extent, along the main stem of the Susquehanna River below the mouth of the Juniata River\\" (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1965). It is estimated that Raystown Lake was effective in preventing damages in the Juniata Basin downstream from the dam of $48,100,000 and of $11,900,000 along the lower Susquehanna River (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1974). Another important aspect was the plan for its recreational activities. These recreational activities primarily were planned around summer water-based and outdoor sports by Karl Kaufffman, chief of outdoor planning and Michael Kolessar, project planning chief, both of Baltimore District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) (Anon., 1973). Their plan included impounding to create a lake, creating of shoreline. In the early stages of the recreation creation it was projected that there would be 1.4 million annual visitors with a $2 million annual intake (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1974). There were also the plans to build Seven Points Marina recreation area and Rothrock camping area. Seven Points Marina was planned to provide long-term boat storage and marina services according to minimum specifications set by USA-CE. Kauffman and Kolessar stated that Seven Points recreation area was designed for public use and convenience, with camping areas, boat launching sites and bathing facilities-to provide the \\"whole gamut of outdoor recreation\\" (Anon., 1973). Also it was to be advertised national and supervised by the USACE Raystown Force (Anon., 1973). Rothrock camping area would provide a camping space with a boat launching ramp, beach and shower facilities. But what is interesting is that Kauffman noted that the \\"camping spaces at the new reservoir will be , center to center, and his (Kauffman's) management plans include withholding 20 percent of the total available camping area from use each year, on a rotating basis, to allow the vegetation time to recoup\\" (Anon., 1973). Using the new dam for hydroelectric power should not have been a surprise considering that that was the primary purpose of the original dam. What was surprising was that the hydroelectric power was under much controversy and not completed until August 31, 1988, when the William F. Matson Generating Station was dedicated. Much of the controversy had to do with the design of the station, because it was now publicly instead of privately owned, which opened the decisions of the design to a vast array of individuals instead of a limited few. \\"In August of 1979, the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors, an independent review agency within the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, put the issue of pumped storage hydro-electric generation to rest by announcing that it couldn't recommend federal participation in such a project due to a lack of local support\\" (Shuck, 1989). In 1980, Allegheny Electric Cooperative and the Pennsylvania Electric Company (Penelec) jointly filed application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to build a run-of-the-river hydro power station just below the breast of the dam (Shuck, 1989). In this plan the turbines would only be spun by water exiting over the dam's spillways, eliminating the threat of significant water fluctuations (Shuck, 1989). But because of the Three Mile Island disaster, Penelec left Allegheny Energy to be responsible for the project in 1986. This $41 million facility had the capacity of generating 21 megawatts and service 8,500 homes with energy. The construction of the dam was a project of the Baltimore Corps of Engineers with Colonel Love in charge, Karl Kauffman chief of outdoor planning, and Michael Kolessar as project planning chief, and the Green Construction Company. Construction started in 1968 on the dam and operation began in 1973 (Anon., 1987). The construction of the dam did leave an impact on the area which included covering many of Huntingdon County landmarks, such as the old Raystown Dam, Fink's bridge, Murrell Worthing property near Entriken, Entriken Barn, Earl Fisher property near Entriken, Hawn's Bridge, six cottages by New Hawn's Bridge, Entriken Mansion, Charles Hoover Feed Mill near Aitch, Entriken Bridge, Juniata Township Community Center near Hawn's Bridge, and Schell Bridge (Anon., 1966). Although it might appear that the dam was well accepted in the area there were some controversial issues. One of the main controversies dealt with funding the project. During this time period the Vietnam War was occurring and so leisure spending was not received well by most individuals who had ties with Vietnam. Also, there was the concern that this was a purely recreational unnecessary project and not for flood control. At the time the Chairman of the Senate Public Works Committee, Senator Allen J. Ellender, did not approve of funding this unnecessary project. In the \\"Help Save the Raystown Dam\\" petition it states, \\"Senator Allen J. Ellender... has expressed his dissatisfaction with the new dam because he feels the Army Engineers should be taking care of flood control, navigation and hurricane projects, and not building recreational areas. The Army Engineers have told the committee that 62 percent of the reason for building the dam is for recreation.\\" This petition listed five areas of concern: # The federal government should not be spending money to build recreational projects at this time; # The Army Engineers should spend their time in projects that are more concerned with flood control, navigation and hurricane projection; # All available money should be spent in supporting Armed Forces in Vietnam; # All unnecessary spending should be cut to help keep the dollar sound; # The average taxpayer in Central Pennsylvania does not support this new dam (Anon. 1968) This petition was to take action for the May 8, 1968 hearing. The dam was approved for a total expenditure of 67.8 million dollars. Another issue was the amount of land needed. The lands authorized to be acquired consisted of for the dam and reservoir area, for the public access and recreation area, and for the wildlife mitigation area for a total acreage of at $20,000,000.00 (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1974). In the end 1,800 property owners sold their deeds or easements to the federal government and 407 graves were relocated (Shuck, 1990). The construction of the new Raystown Dam and Raystown Lake was completed in 1972. The lake was conveniently nearly filled by Tropical Storm Agnes. The Lake Raystown Program of Dedication relates the significance of the Tropical Storm Agnes and the Lake Raystown Dam by noting, \\"The partially completed Raystown Lake Project was effective in storing of flood water (ultimate flood control storage is ) during the June 1972 Storm Agnes which resulted in reducing peak flows in the Juniata River at Lewistown and Newport, Pennsylvania by and , respectively. Had the project not been available for flood storage, stages at both of these stations would have exceeded the record 1936 flood. It is estimated that Lake Raystown Dam was effective in preventing Agnes damages in the Juniata Basin downstream from the dam of $48,100,000 and of $11,900,000 along the lower Susquehanna River\\" (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1974). The formal ceremony of dedication for Lake Raystown was June 6, 1974 and the area attracts about 1.5 million visitors annually. The history of the Raystown Dam is not limited to the history of the dam and lake itself but also includes the human history of the watershed and the environmental laws relevant to the area. The original hydroelectric dam underwent construction in 1907 resulting in the Raystown Water and Power Co. (later Penelec) generating their first electricity in 1912. The spillway elevation was around above sea level. The expansion brought the water level up to a normal operating level of above sea level with an overflow at , and included a 20 megawatt conventional hydropower generator. Part of the town of Aitch is now under the level of the lake. While it is rumored that there are entire towns (and dead bodies of townspeople who refused to leave) still intact under the water, only a few more permanent structures were left in place. Some roads, a bridge over the old river, the original power station and the original dam still remain. =Archaeological area= Sheep Rock Shelter is an area of archaeological significance near the present-day Susquehannock Campground. Originally a wide ledge over the Juniata River, it provided shelter from the elements for its inhabitants. Its location and orientation preserved the remains buried below by protecting them from wind and moisture. When it was announced in the 1960s that the lake would be expanded, Juniata College and Pennsylvania State University excavated to uncover artifacts that would otherwise be flooded, ending their state of preservation. Their work recovered human remains from as long as 12,000 years ago.

Most of his works appeared in Amsterdam or elsewhere in the Dutch Republic. He was the father of Pieter and Thomas de Keyser and Willem, and the uncle of Huybert de Keyser, who became his apprentices and all involved in building, decoration and architecture.  Biography and works Singel 142 designed by H. de Keyser Hendrick de Keyser was born in Utrecht, and the son of a cabinetmaker. He grew up in a expropriated monastery, the Catalijne Convent. As a young man he was apprenticed to the engineer Cornelis Bloemaert (the elder). In 1591 he followed Bloemaert to Amsterdam and married Beyken van Wildre from Antwerp. Soon he set to work as an independent artist. In 1595 he was appointed city stonemason and sculptor. In 1603 the working on the Zuiderkerk stopped but they resumed construction in 1606, when they agreed with the church board.https://onsamsterdam.nl/400-jaar-zuiderkerk; http://zuiderkerkamsterdam.nl/ons/Abrahamse, J.E.

Perhaps they met with Inigo Jones, but he does not appear to have turned seriously to architecture until after his Italian tour of 1614.https://www.shafe.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/6-Inigo-Jones.pdf De Keyser was friendly with the painter Cornelis Ketel, both were Arminian or Remonstrant, whom he visited when Ketel made his will.1606 20 maart NA 36-118 [ook NA 26-677] not.

De Keyser was visited by Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger and his brother Lorenz from Denmark who may have asked him for advise or training.Neurdenburg, E. van (1930) Hendrick de Keyser. Beeldhouwer en bouwmeester van Amsterdamp. 92, 93, 129 Quite a few of his siblings also lived in the area. His brothers Jacob who was a cabinetmaker, and Aert a timber merchant, and Huybert his nephew all lived near Jodenbreestraat in a sidestreet. (In 1639 the heirs sold the house to the sephardic community.) Hendrick is famous for a number of important buildings, gates and towers which belong to the core of Dutch historic sites. Today the Zuiderkerk (1603/6-1611) and accompanying tower (1614), the City Hall (Delft) (1618-1620), the Westerkerk (1620-1631) are among the historic buildings which provide important insights into De Keyser's work. His Commodity Exchange of 1608-1613 was pulled down in the 19th century. The East India House in Amsterdam was most likely also designed by him; a later extension was done by his son Pieter. Hendrick de Keyser's projects in Amsterdam during the early decades of the 17th century helped establish a late Mannerist style referred to as \\"Amsterdam Renaissance\\". The Amsterdam Renaissance style deviates in many respects from sixteenth-century Italian Renaissance architecture. Classical elements such as pilasters, cornices and pediments were used on a large scale, but mainly as decorative elements. De Keyser never slavishly followed the tenets of classical architecture as laid down in the Italian treatises by Serlio and Palladio. His version came to full bloom at the end of the second decade of the 17th century, and set the stage for the later Dutch classical phase of Jacob van Campen and Pieter Post. Apart from pursuing a career as an architect, De Keyser remained active as a sculptor. He designed the tomb of William the Silent for the Nieuwe Kerk (Delft) (1614-1623). However, De Keyser did not live to see the finished product. His son Pieter, who inherited his tools and designs, completed his work. In 1631 Salomon de Bray included the architect's most important sketches, based on mathematical regularity, in his book ‚ÄôArchitectura Moderna‚Äô.Architectura moderna ofte bouwinge van onsen tyt (1971)‚ÄìSalomon de Bray. DBNL De Keyser's career was not limited to Amsterdam, and his international contacts helped him to keep in touch with the mainstream of European architecture. In 1607 the Amsterdam city administrators sent him to England where he worked with Inigo Jones? When De Keyser and Danckerts returned to Amsterdam Nicholas Stone, joined them. For several years Stone worked with De Keyser and even became his son-in-law in 1613. De Keyser attention to England and English architecture reflect Amsterdam's position as a commercial centre in Europe. De Keyser died on his birthday and was buried in the nearby Zuiderkerk.

Swedes' Landing is the warehouse road found along the Minquas Kill in Wilmington, Delaware that is close to the Delaware River. This was the site where the initial Swedish landing took place and marks the spot where the New Sweden colony began. The first Swedish expedition to North America, under the command of Peter Minuit, embarked from the port of Gothenburg in late 1637. The members of the expedition, aboard the ships Fogel Grip and Kalmar Nyckel, sailed into Delaware Bay, which lay within the territory claimed by the Dutch West India Company and anchored at a rocky point on Swedes' Landing on March 29, 1638. They built a fort on the site which they named Fort Christina after Queen Christina of Sweden. Today Swedes Landing Road is a short stretch from 4th Street to 7th Street and ends at a long two-story mural depicting the area from the time before the Swedes came through the modern Wilmington waterfront. At the far end of the mural is the entrance to Fort Christina National Historical Site, a part of the First State National Historical Park System.

Slaughter, pseudonym C.V. Terry, was an American novelist and physician whose books sold more than 60 million copies. His novels drew on his own experience as a doctor and his interest in history and the Bible. Through his novels, he often introduced readers to new findings in medical research and new medical technologies. Biography Slaughter was born in Washington, D.C., the son of Stephen Lucious Slaughter and Sarah \\"Sallie\\" Nicholson Gill. When he was about five years old, his family moved to a farm near Berea, North Carolina, which is west of Oxford, North Carolina. He earned a bachelor's degree from Trinity College (now Duke University) at 17 and went to medical school at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. He began writing fiction in 1935 while a physician at Riverside Hospital in Jacksonville, Florida, paying off a $60 typewriter at $5 a month. He rewrote the manuscript of That None Should Die, a semi- autobiographical story of a young doctor, six times before Doubleday accepted it. Several of Slaughter's novels became films, including Sangaree, made into the 1953 film of that name starring Fernando Lamas; and Doctors' Wives, made into the 1971 film of the same name starring Dyan Cannon and Gene Hackman. Other books by Slaughter include The Purple Quest, Surgeon, U.S.A., Tomorrow's Miracle and The Scarlet Cord. Slaughter's last novel, Transplant, was published in 1987. Slaughter died May 17, 2001 in Jacksonville, Florida.

Like the UTM coordinate system, the UPS coordinate system uses a metric-based cartesian grid laid out on a conformally projected surface. UPS covers the Earth's polar regions, specifically the areas north of 84¬∞N and south of 80¬∞S, which are not covered by the UTM grids, plus an additional 30 minutes of latitude extending into UTM grid to provide some overlap between the two systems. In the polar regions, directions can become complicated, with all geographic north‚Äìsouth lines converging at the poles. The difference between UPS grid north and true north can therefore be anything up to 180¬∞‚Äîin some places, grid north is true south, and vice versa. UPS grid north is arbitrarily defined as being along the prime meridian in the Antarctic and the 180th meridian in the Arctic; thus, east and west on the grids when moving directly away from the pole are along the 90¬∞E and 90¬∞W meridians respectively. Projection system As the name indicates, the UPS system uses a stereographic projection. Specifically, the projection used in the system is a secant version based on an elliptical model of the earth. The scale factor at each pole is adjusted to 0.994 so that the latitude of true scale is 81.11451786859362545¬∞ (about 81¬∞ 06' 52.3\\") North and South. The scale factor inside the regions at latitudes higher than this parallel is too small, whereas the regions at latitudes below this line have scale factors that are too large, reaching 1.0016 at 80¬∞ latitude. The scale factor at the origin (the poles) is adjusted to minimize the overall distortion of scale within the mapped region. As with the Mercator projection, the region near the tangent (or secant) point on a Stereographic map remains very close to true scale for an angular distance of a few degrees. In the ellipsoidal model, a stereographic projection tangent to the pole has a scale factor of less than 1.003 at 84¬∞ latitude and 1.008 at 80¬∞ latitude. The adjustment of the scale factor in the UPS projection reduces the average scale distortion over the entire zone.

The presidio was built by Spain in 1782, with the mission of defending the Second Military District in California. In modern times, the Presidio serves as a significant tourist attraction, museum and an active archaeological site as part of El Presidio de Santa Barbara State Historic Park. The park contains an original adobe structure called El Cuartel, which is the second oldest surviving building in California, only the chapel at Mission San Juan Capistrano, known as \\"Father Jun√≠pero Serra's Church\\", is older. The Presidio of Santa Barbara has the distinction of being the last military outpost built by Spain in the New World.Tompkins, 1975, p. 8 The Presidio became a California Historical Landmark in 1958 and was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1973. El Cuartel (Guard's House) is the oldest building in Santa Barbara Contemporary setting and use The current El Presidio de Santa Barbara State Historic Park site sits between Anacapa and Garden Street on East Canon Perdido Street in downtown Santa Barbara. The main portion of the site is across the street from the Santa Barbara city Post Office, and is about two blocks from city hall, De la Guerra Plaza and two other museums, the Santa Barbara Historical Museum and the Casa de la Guerra and includes a reconstructed quadrangle with soldiers' quarters and a chapel. Only two portions of the original presidio quadrangle survive to this day: a remnant of the Ca√±edo Adobe, named for Jos√© Mar√≠a Ca√±edo, the Soldado de Cuera to whom it was deeded in lieu of back pay when the Presidio fell to inactivity, and the remnants of a two-room soldiers quarters, called El Cuartel. The Ca√±edo Adobe is currently serving as the visitor's center for the state park, and El Cuartel is largely unmodified. The site administrator, the Santa Barbara Trust for Historic Preservation (SBTHP),Santa Barbara Trust for Historic Preservation reconstructed the rest of the site, with the most recent construction‚Äîtwo rooms in the northwest corner of the site‚Äîfinished in May 2006. The reconstruction is ongoing, with the more recent construction of two more rooms in the northwest corner. The Presidio Chapel and courtyard were also completed during the construction of the quadrangle. The chapel is occasionally used for civic events such as musical concerts and lectures. Although not a canonical Roman Catholic oratory, Roman Catholic weddings are occasionally performed in the chapel with the permission of the local Roman Catholic Santa Barbara Pastoral Regional bishop. History Interior of the reconstructed chapel. The site of the Presidio was chosen by Felipe de Neve, the fourth governor of Las Californias. Perceiving that the coast at Santa Barbara was vulnerable to attack, he located a spot near a harbor which was sheltered from severe storms. In addition, there was an ample supply of both building materials and water nearby. Construction began on April 21, 1782, and Padre Jun√≠pero Serra blessed the site. By the next year, a temporary facility had been completed, and a wheat field planted by the local Chumash Indians of Chief Yanonalit. The early Presidio consisted of mud and brush walls around a quadrangle 330 feet on a side.Tompkins, 1975, p. 8-9 The post had 61 officers and men in 1783. The first comandante, Jos√© Francisco Ortega, planned the fortifications and irrigation works. He obtained livestock for the presidio from Mission San Buenaventura, established orchards, and began large-scale farming. In 1784, Felipe de Goicoechea took over as comandante, supervising construction of the fortifications and living quarters for the soldiers and their families. Two years later, construction of the nearby Mission Santa Barbara began in 1786. The pueblo or town of Santa Barbara developed around the Presidio, which offered protection for the residents.For the Juan Vicente Revillagigedo Census of 1790, see The Spanish Census of 1790, Las Californias, California Spanish Genealogy. Retrieved on 2008-08-04. Compiled from William Marvin Mason. The Census of 1790: A Demographic History of California. (Menlo Park: Ballena Press, 1998). 75-105. . The chapel in the Presidio was the primary place of worship for the residents of early Santa Barbara, until its destruction by the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake. The mission, located a mile and a half inland, was mainly intended for use by the native Chumash (Barbare√±o) neophytes after their conversion to Catholicism. The Presidio was built to standard plans for a Spanish colonial military headquarters, using locally available materials, so the buildings forming the outer square were constructed with thick, solid adobe outer walls. The main gate opened into an open parade ground/plaza in the center of the square. The chapel stood at the center of the back of the square, facing the gate across the plaza. While it was never attacked by a strong military force during its sixty years of operation, the Presidio was subject to the assaults of nature. Several devastating earthquakes in the early 19th century destroyed much of the structure. In 1855 the Presidio Chapel grew into the Apostolic College of Our Lady of Sorrows, which soon became Our Lady of Sorrows Church at the corner of Figueroa and State Streets, and then at the corner of Anacapa and Sola streets in 1929. However, both still stand separately as vibrant churches of a richly Catholic history. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War At the time of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in Alta California, very little of the fortress remained in usable condition, and on December 27, 1846, John C. Fr√©mont ascended San Marcos Pass during rainy weather and came up on the Presidio and the town from behind. The Presidio surrendered without a fight, as the garrison was far south in the Pueblo de Los Angeles. Fr√©mont had heard that the Mexican army was lying in ambush for him at Gaviota Pass, the only other sensible route over the mountains at that time, and had crossed the difficult muddy track on San Marcos Pass to outflank them, but this move turned out not to have been necessary. Mexican General Andr√©s Pico later surrendered his force to Fr√©mont, recognizing that the war was lost.Tompkins, 1975, p. 33‚Äì35 Preservation In 1963, the Santa Barbara Trust for Historic Preservation (SBTHP) was founded, with the primary mission of restoring the Presidio. In 1966, the land on which the Presidio is located became a State Historic Park. On December 27, 2006, the SBTHP renewed their ongoing agreement with the California State Parks Department to manage the Presidio. Work on the restoration is currently taking place. On November 26, 1973 the Presidio of Santa Barbara was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. = Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail = The Presidio of Santa Barbara is one of the designated tour sights of the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail, a National Park Service unit in the United States National Historic Trail and National Millennium Trail programs.

Daniel McLean (January 4, 1868 ‚Äì March 2, 1950) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1914 to 1915, and later served as the 32nd Mayor of Winnipeg for two years. McLean was a member of the Conservative Party. Biography McLean was born in the Scotch Block of Esquesing Township, Halton County, Ontario,, reprinted from the Winnipeg Free Press the son of Mr. G. McLean, and was educated at public schools in Georgetown. McLean came to Manitoba in 1892. In 1895, he married A. Blanchard. He worked as a real estate broker and farmer, and served as president of McLean and Grisdale Ltd. He was also appointed Lieutenant-Colonel of the 106th Regiment (Winnipeg Light Infantry) on April 1, 1912. In religion, McLean was a Presbyterian. McLean was an alderman in Winnipeg from 1907 to 1910, and a city controller from 1913 to 1914. He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1914 provincial election, defeating Liberal candidate Robert Newton Lowery and Social Democrat Herman Saltzmann in Winnipeg North \\"B\\". The Conservatives won a majority government in this election, and McLean served as a backbench supporter of Rodmond Roblin's administration. In 1915, the Roblin administration was forced to resign from office after a report commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor found the government guilty of corruption in the tendering of contracts for new legislative buildings. A new election was called, which the Liberals won in a landslide. McLean did not seek re-election. During World War I, McLean served overseas as commander of the 101st Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. From 1918 to 1919, he served on Headquarters Staff for Military Division No. 10. From 1919 to 1921, he was commander of the 10th Battalion (Canadians), CEF. He attempted to return to the legislature in the 1922 provincial election. By this time, the city of Winnipeg had been re-designed as a single ten-member constituency, with members chosen by a single transferable ballot. McLean finished in 24th place on the first count with 515 votes, and was eliminated on the twenty- first count. He served as mayor of Winnipeg in 1928-29, succeeding fellow Conservative Ralph Webb. He was defeated by Webb when he ran for reelection as mayor for 1930. He died in Winnipeg at the age of 82.

The SJVR has trackage rights over Union Pacific (formerly Southern Pacific) from Fresno - Goshen Jct - Famoso - Bakersfield - Algoso. The SJVR also operates for the Tulare Valley Railroad (TVRR) from Calwa to Corcoran and Famoso. There were two former San Joaquin Valley Railroads. One was owned by Leland Stanford in 1870 to build an line from Lathrop, California to the Stanislaus River and was consolidated into the Central Pacific Railroad. The second San Joaquin Valley Railroad operated from 1892‚Äì1893 between Fresno and Friant over of track and was sold at foreclosure to the Southern Pacific. In 1991, the SJVR operated the entire former SP line from Fresno to Famoso, but a portion north of Famoso was later abandoned. SJVR interchanges with the BNSF Railway at Fresno and Bakersfield and with the Union Pacific at Fresno and Goshen Junction. SJVR was originally owned by Kyle Railways. In 1992, the SJVR was created to obtain and operate several branch lines from the Southern Pacific. From 1992‚Äì1997, the SJVR was owned by Kyle Railways. In 1997, SJVR's parent, Kyle Railways, was sold to States Rail. In 2002 SJVR's new parent, States Rail, was purchased by RailAmerica. Genesee & Wyoming Inc. controlled RailAmerica in December 2012.

(former SP) History =West Side Line= This mainline route was formerly known as Southern Pacific's \\"West Side Line\\" and at one time extended from Tracy, California and then south through the West side of the San Joaquin Valley (I-5 corridor) via Patterson, Gustine, Newman, Los Banos, Oxalis and then east to Fresno via Ingle and Kerman. California Northern Railroad now operates the northern section of the line from Tracy - Los Banos. SJVR operates the southern section of the line from Oxalis to Fresno and was at one time owned by Port Railroads, Inc. (PRI; also a Kyle subsidiary) and operated by the SJVR. On April 24, 1996 the PRI was merged into the SJVR. Both the PRI and SJVR were already Kyle Railway subsidiaries. The section of track between Los Banos and Oxalis was abandoned by Southern Pacific in 1993 and the tracks were removed soon after. The Southern Pacific constructed the track from Tracy to Newman (37 miles) and from Los Banos to Armona (near Fresno) in 1891. Southern Pacific's overnight Owl passenger train (#57/58) operated over this line between San Francisco and Los Angeles into 1965. =Exeter Subdivision= In 2008, the Surface Transportation Board approved the abandonment of the section of track between Strathmore and Jovista. This left the communities of Strathmore, Porterville, Terra Bella, Ducor, and Richgrove without any rail service. Tulare County has recently broken off negotiations with the SJVR to purchase this section of track to preserve it for future use and possible reactivation. However, beginning in September 2010, the tracks were being removed by the SJVR and the job was completed with the entire line having been pulled up in mid November. The future of this line is very much in doubt and with the rails having now been removed, it's extremely unlikely that trains will ever traverse that corridor again. As of March 2015, the SJVR has embargoed the line with the rails spiked at the south end of Exeter with some crossing signals south already having been partially dismantled. This section of track, which runs approximately 8 miles to Lindsay is now pending formal abandonment whereupon the rails are expected to be immediately pulled up upon STB approval. The sections from Exeter to Dinuba along with former ATSF track between Lindsay and Exeter is expected to follow given their poor condition and lack of use. Traffic The railroad's main traffic sources are petroleum gas and agricultural products. In 2008, the SJVR hauled around 39,000 carloads. Rolling Stock The railroad operates GP15-1's, GP40-2's, GP28's, GP20's, GP38's, GP38-2's, BL20-2's, and SE24B's.http://www.rrpicturearchives.net/locoList.aspx?id=SJVR See also *List of United States railroads *List of California railroads *RailAmerica  References  *Edward A.

Emuellidae can be recognized among trilobites in having a set of unique features. The headshield or cephalon has large genal spines reaching back as far as the 3rd to 6th segment of the thorax. The eye-ridges contact the back of the frontal lobe of the glabella and extend laterally and backwards, roughly parallel to the frontal and lateral rim of the cephalon. There are small, clearly incised pits at the junction between the eye-ridge and the frontal lobe of the cephalic axis (or glabella). The thorax reaches its greatest width at the 6th segment. The frontal part or prothorax consists of 6 segments, with number 5 and 6 fused, and the 6th carrying very large trailing spines. The rear part or opistothorax consists of a variable but extremely large number of segments (up to 97).  Description  (See the Trilobite article for a definition of morphological terms) Cephalon: Cranidium subquadrate, glabella cylindrical, slightly contracted at S3, three pairs of glabellar furrows, preglabellar field short or absent, eye ridge wide, long, directed slightly postero-laterally, palpebral lobe cresentic, posterior area of fixigena with fulcrum, free cheeks (or librigenae) with long spines; hypostome conterminant, attached to a narrow rostral plate. The thorax is divided into a prothorax of six segments (the 6th carrying very large, trailing, pleural spines and extremely long opisthothorax of up to 97 segments (Balcoraciana dailyi holds the record for greatest number of thoracic segments in a trilobite species). Pygidium: A minute, segmented disc.  Taxonomic history  Fossils now assigned to the Emuellidae were first discovered by Dr. B. Daily, of the Geology Department, University of Adelaide in 1956. = Position of the Emuellidae within the Redlichiida = Originally, the Emuellidae were described as part of the Redlichiina. The primitive features prompted the theory that the Emuellids actually represented the stem group of all trilobites, with the Olenellina having secondary fused facial sutures. Later, the Emuellidae were placed in their own superfamily (Emuelloidea), recognizing that trilobites lacking facial sutures (i.e. the Olenellina) are the stem group. This was followed by the clustering of the Emuellidae in a new superfamily Ellipsocephaloidea. Most recently, the Emuellidae are regarded an early branch of the Redlichiina suborder, the closest relatives being the genera Bigotina, Abadiella, and the close-knit group of the families Estaingiidae, Ichangiidae and Ellipsocephalidae. = Genera assigned to the Emuellidae = Holyoakia has previously been assigned to the Emuellidae. The tailshiel (or pygidium) in Holyoakia is about the same size as its cranidium, with a well-defined axis, eight axial rings, well-developed pleural ribs and furrows, and a spiny margin. The pygidia of Emuella and Balcoracania however are poorly differentiated, minute, and have a smooth margin. Later scholars therefore placed Holyoakia in the Dorypygidae.  Distribution  Balcoracania dailyi occurs in the late Lower Cambrian (late Botomian) of South Australia (White Point conglomerate, Cape d' Estaing and Emu Bay sections, Kangaroo Island; Warragee Member, Billy Creek Formation, Flinders Range; Coads Hill Member, Billy Creek Formation, Reaphook Hill). Balcoracania sp. has been collected from the Lower Cambrian of Antarctica (Shackleton Limestone, central Transantarctic Mountains). Emuella dalgarnoi is found in the late Lower Cambrian (late Botomian) of South Australia (Emu Bay Shale, Kangaroo Island).

Related projects would have continued the route through the neighboring suburb of Gresham, out to the city of Sandy. The original plans for the freeway were presented by the Oregon State Highway Department as part of a 1955 report that proposed 14 new highways in the Portland metropolitan area. (Urban planner Robert Moses drafted Portland's original postwar infrastructure plan.)\\"Moses Offers Plan for Portland Jobs\\" (New York Times, November 11, 1943) The proposed route was to run parallel to the existing alignment of US 26 on Powell Boulevard, and would have required the destruction of 1,750 long-standing Portland homes and one percent of the Portland housing stock. Plans for the freeway triggered a revolt in Portland in the late 1960s and early 1970s, leading to its eventual cancellation. Plans for other proposed freeways in Portland were also scrapped, including Interstate 505. Funds for the project (and other canceled freeways) were spent on other transportation projects, including the first section of the MAX Light Rail system. When the freeway was canceled, a segment was already completed southeastwards from East Burnside Road and Southeast Powell Blvd in Gresham, continuing to Sandy, which remains in use today.  Alignment  The freeway would have run from the Willamette River (at the Marquam Bridge) to about SE 50th Avenue adjacent to the south side of Division St. It would then have shifted to Powell Blvd. (Route 26) near SE 54th Avenue. By the initial plan, the freeway would have ended at SE 122nd Avenue, though extensions were considered. In 1962, this section was formally submitted for inclusion in the U.S. Interstate Highway System as part of Interstate 80N, today's I-84. I-205 was in the planning stages at the time the Mount Hood Freeway was first proposed. The I-205 routing was originally envisioned for the 52nd Avenue corridor, but ended up being built farther east at about 93rd Avenue. All plans for the Mount Hood Freeway allowed for a future I-205 connection at various spots. Another segment of the proposal was called the Mount Hood Expressway. It would have continued the Mount Hood Freeway alignment past a stack interchange at I-205, continuing to follow Powell Blvd. before skirting Gresham to the south and connecting to the existing route. The final segment of the proposal continued southeast from Gresham and ran to the outskirts of Sandy. This section was actually constructed (and is an expressway-grade highway), with a single interchange at the junction with Oregon Route 212. = Route designations = The new highway would have carried US 26 along the entire alignment, while I-80N was to be re-routed along the portion between I-5 and I-205. The I-80N designation would have been removed from the Banfield Freeway, and the route would be duplexed over I-205 between the segments. US 26 would be taken off Powell Blvd, the Ross Island Bridge, and downtown Portland streets, continuing on I-5 and I-405 to the Sunset Highway. The Banfield Freeway section would have been taken out of the Interstate system and signed only as U.S. Route 30.  Revolt and aftermath  By the time planners began to think seriously about building the Mount Hood Freeway in the 1970s, the neighborhoods in and near its path mobilized grass- roots efforts against the freeway. The movements gained citywide and local support which changed the political landscape in local elections. Soon, it seemed as if the Federal government and some in the Oregon State Highway Department (now the Oregon Department of Transportation) were the only ones who wanted the freeway. The freeway's promoted virtue of a speedy commute was debunked by the freeway's opponents. On one hand, it was seen as benefiting only suburban Gresham and East Multnomah County at the expense of Portland's neighborhoods. On the other hand, many opponents stated that the freeway would be obsolete the minute it opened, jamming with traffic volumes that the freeway was not designed for. Efforts to make the freeway more acceptable made their way into the later proposals. Among the proposals were increased landscaping and bike paths along the route as well as parks and community centers built over the freeway's \\"air rights\\" and a \\"transitway\\" with three- level stations (separate levels for local buses and express buses) for an express busway. These efforts, however, were not enough to sell the project. When the project was finally canceled in 1974, local transportation planners began to look at completing I-205. Disputes with the new freeway-adverse Multnomah County Commission had left a huge gap between the two completed sections. I-205 ended in the south just across the Clackamas County line and stopped at the Columbia River in the north. After the successful battle over the Mount Hood, activists were pushing for I-205's cancellation, while some neighborhoods and businesses wanted it further east or west (depending on the proposal). After some negotiation, I-205's Multnomah County segment was finalized, reducing interchanges, eliminating a possible provision for a Mount Hood Freeway interchange, and resulting in the alignment of today's I-205. An unfinished, grade-separated transitway and a bike path were added to I-205, part of the Mount Hood Freeway ideas that actually influenced another freeway. The transitway is now being used as the route for the TriMet MAX Red Line and the MAX Green Line. Since the completion of I-205, no major freeways have been built in the Portland metropolitan area. Some believe the Mount Hood Freeway is one of the things most recognizable as a reason for the development and promotion of alternative forms of transportation in Portland. The MAX light rail system, the Portland Transit Mall, and the city's notable bicycle- friendly policies are said by some Portlanders to have stemmed from the freeway revolt.  Remnants  Only a few physical signs are around of the canceled freeway, mostly in the form of incomplete connecting ramps or ramp stubs. Some previous evidence of the Mount Hood Freeway has been eliminated with new roadwork. The defunct Grand Avenue leg of the Union Avenue (MLK Jr. Blvd) Viaduct, built in the 1960s * Interchange grading: At the western end of Segment Three, the highway was graded to support an interchange with the proposed Segment Two. An unusual divided sweeping turn is visible where an interchange with an unbuilt segment would have been.Interchange at * Ramp from I-5 southbound: Just as the southbound lanes enter the lower level of the approach to the Marquam Bridge, a left exit (which would have been 300A) is blocked off, complete with an empty sign bridge (replaced in 2015). This would have been the southbound I-5 access to the Mount Hood Freeway eastbound. Places to attach similar ramps were built for other directions of travel on I-5, but they were instead used to widen the freeway in 1990 (and reconstruction of the ramp from I-5 northbound to I-84). There is a bridge support that is wider than needed to support the existing lanes of I-5.Support Services History Center Photos - Bridges * Marquam Bridge configuration: On the lower deck (southbound), the ramp to I-405 exits in the left lanes, not the right. This was because the Mount Hood Freeway ramps were to come onto the bridge on the same side before the span, so lane changes would be unnecessary to continue on US 26 (it was to be duplexed with I-405). The same applies for the upper deck for the right lanes. * Grand Avenue Viaduct: A ramp stub on the bridge over the railroad tracks was intended as a connection to either I-5 or the Mount Hood Freeway. With the MLK viaduct project of 2007‚Äì2011, this ramp stub has been removed. * I-84 exit numbering: I-84, which replaced I-80N, has a strange numbering pattern near its junction with I-205, indicating that its Banfield Freeway portion was originally considered to be temporary. Specifically, there is about between exits 5 and 9, and mileposts along the Banfield Freeway jump between Mile 7 and Mile 10. The current exit numbers are different from original numbers on the Banfield, which were based on the actual mileposts; for example, what is exit 1 eastbound was originally exit 2A, and what is exit 9 was exit 6. This original exit numbering scheme also points to the temporary routing of I-84 on the Banfield. * I-84/I-205 junction configuration: As one approaches the interchange on I-84 from the east, one uses an exit off the freeway alignment to access the Banfield Freeway (continuing on I-84), whereas one stays on the mainline to access I-205. Also, as one approaches from the west, the Banfield Freeway's lanes merge on the right of lanes that come from I-205. * I-405 signage: At I-405's northern terminus, one keeps left to follow US 30 exiting on I-5 and eventually I-84. The overhead signs marking this exit, however, only mention \\"US 30 East/The Dalles\\" without any mention of I-84 (however, auxiliary signs do say \\"I-5 South/I-84/East Next Left\\"). While the original sign has been replaced, the information is the same as when the Fremont Bridge was opened in 1973, when the Mount Hood Freeway was still planned to be I-80N's Portland routing. (As a side note, I-405's northern interchange with I-5 contains many ramp stubs and truncated ramps of another scrapped Portland freeway, the Rose City Freeway.) * Piccolo Park: This small park sits on land that was acquired for the freeway. * Along Powell Blvd, on the south side of the street is a series of linear parking lots and skinny buildings that have been built in the last 25 years on land that was acquired for the freeway. * Exit 19 southbound on I-205: The approach to the Division/Powell exit, exit 19, has been curbed in an odd way, as if it were to have been a splitting of a duplexed I-84/I-205 into separate freeways; it is now an unusually wide exit. After leaving I-205 the exit splits again, sending Powell-bound traffic beneath a wide Division Street underpass and non-stop to a westbound-only turn onto Powell. This was to be the continuation of westbound I-84 as it merged with the Mount Hood Expressway.

Gambia was the perfect location when the shuttle was launched with a low, 28-degree inclination. In 2001 NASA announced that Banjul airport would no longer be used as an augmented landing site because latterly, NASA would launch shuttles up at 51.6 degrees to the International Space Station, making air bases in Spain and France more suitable for an emergency landing. The airport was the main hub of Gambia Bird until the airline ceased operations in late 2014.

He attended universities in Marburg, Aachen and Berlin, receiving an engineering degree in 1931. During his studies he was active in the Protestant youth movements.The Gerstein Report (in translation). ARC 2006. He joined the Nazi Party in May 1933. As a committed Christian, Gerstein resisted attempts by the Nazi state to control the Christian youth movement, and ran afoul of state authorities. He was expelled from the party in October 1936 after his arrest in September 1936 for circulating anti-Nazi pamphlets. Released, he was arrested a second time in July 1938, spending two months in a concentration camp. Reportedly outraged by the euthanasia or Aktion T4 programme, he decided to join the Waffen SS: \\"to look into the matter of these ovens and chambers in order to learn what happened there.\\" Because of his technical education, Gerstein was placed in the Waffen-SS technical disinfection services where he rose quickly to become its head. It was in that capacity that he traveled to the extermination camps of Belzec and Treblinka offering the supply of hydrogen cyanide (Zyklon B). Testimony regarding gas chambers Be≈Ç≈ºec (lower centre) on the map of German extermination camps marked with black and white skulls, occupied Poland Gerstein stated that on 18 August 1942, he traveled to the extermination camp at Belzec where he witnessed the arrival of \\"45 wagons with 6,700 people of whom 1,450 were already dead on arrival.\\" He described the gassing operation as it happened directly in front of him: Reporting The final part of the report describes Gerstein's attempts to circulate his eyewitness testimony. He reports on his chance encounter with the secretary of the Swedish legation in Berlin, Baron G√∂ran von Otter, on the Warsaw-Berlin train \\"Still under the immediate impression of the terrible events, I told him everything with the entreaty to inform his government and the Allies of all of this immediately because each day's delay must cost the lives of further thousands and tens of thousands.\\" Von Otter did talk with high-ranking officials at the Swedish Foreign Ministry. However, the information was not passed on to the Allies or to any other party.Hilberg, Raul (1985) The Destruction Of The European Jews, Student Eds p241 Holmes & Meier, Teaneck He also reports on his unsuccessful attempts to see the Papal Nuncio Cesare Orsenigo in Berlin. Gerstein wished to notify the Vatican.Phayer, 2000, p. 46. Informed of the purpose of Gerstein's visit, Orenigo refused to meet with him. Gerstein's message was eventually sent to the Vatican, by the auxiliary bishop of Berlin, not the nuncio's office, where the information reached a \\"dead end\\". In addition to these attempts, Gerstein also stated he reported these eye witness accounts to \\"hundreds of personages.\\" Although not explicitly mentioned in the 1945 report, one of these attempts was via a Dutch industrialist, J.H. Ubbink. In February 1943, Ubbink visited Gerstein in Berlin, wherein Gerstein Ubbink passed this information on to a member of the Dutch Resistance, Cornelius Van der Hooft who, a few days later on March 23, 1943 wrote \\"T√∂tunsanstalten in Polen\\" (English translation: Killing Institutions in Poland), a four-page report in Dutch which apparently remained hidden in the chicken coop of another member of the Dutch Resistance and this version only came to light in 1996. The March report however, does seem to have been sent to the Dutch government-in-exile as on April 24, 1943, one month after the meeting between Van der Hooft and Ubbink, another version of the report inspired by Gerstein was written. Typed on paper without an official heading, and with the simplified title of \\"T√∂tungsanstalten\\", this version circulated within the Dutch government-in-exile, via the British government and eventually to the attention of the United States Inter-Allied Information Committee.Brayard, Florent (2000) An Early Report by Kurt Gerstein, Bulletin du Centre de recherche fran√ßais √† J√©rusalem [On Line], published on line 19 May 2008, Accessed 10 March 2018. URL : http://journals.openedition.org/bcrfj/3022 Use as evidence in trials Gerstein's report has been used as evidence in a number of high-profile cases. It was used at the Nuremberg Trials against major Nazi war criminals such as Hermann G√∂ring and Hans Frank.Kurt Gerstein, Nuremberg Trial Document PS-1553. It was also later used in the prosecution of Adolf Eichmann by an Israeli court. More recently in 2000 it was used by Christopher Browning in the Holocaust libel trial between David Irving and Deborah Lipstadt.Evidence for the Implementation of the Final Solution: Electronic Edition, by Browning, Christopher R. Criticism While some aspects of Gerstein's report include false statements attributed to Odilo Globocnik, as well as inaccurate claims regarding the total number of Jews gassed at Holocaust locations where he was not an eyewitness, Gerstein's claim that gassing of Jews occurred at Belzec is independently corroborated by SS-Standartenf√ºhrer Wilhelm Pfannenstiel's testimony given at the Belzec trials,HDOT : Irving v. Lipstadt : Defense Documents : Evidence for the Implementation of the Final Solution: Electronic EditionShofar FTP Archives: people/p/pfannenstiel.wilhelm/ as well as by the accounts of other witnesses that can be found in Gitta Sereny's Into That Darkness, a biography of one-time Treblinka commandant Franz Stangl. Holocaust historian Christopher Browning has written: > Many aspects of Gerstein's testimony are unquestionably problematic. [In > making] statements, such as the height of the piles of shoes and clothing at > Belzec and Treblinka, Gerstein himself is clearly the source of > exaggeration. Gerstein also added grossly exaggerated claims about matters > to which he was not an eyewitness, such as that a total of 25 million Jews > and others were gassed. But in the essential issue, namely that he was in > Belzec and witnessed the gassing of a transport of Jews from Lwow, his > testimony is fully corroborated .... It is also corroborated by other > categories of witnesses from Belzec. Historian Robin O'Neil noted that Gerstein's data presented at face value about the enormous capacity of the gas chambers i.e. \\"four times 750 persons\\" has no grounds in reality. The Gerstein Report has also been targeted by Holocaust deniers who claim that its author approached G√∂ran von Otter on behalf of the Nazis. French historian, Pierre Vidal-Naquet in \\"Assassins of Memory\\" considered such allegations preposterous.Pierre Vidal-Naquet (1987): \\"Assassins of Memory\\" (Note 63).

Both emuellid genera share eye ridges that are positioned parallel to the frontal and lateral border of the head, prominent genal spines that are a smooth continuation of the lateral margin of the head, a prothorax of 6 segments, with the 5th and 6th merged and carrying large trailing spines. Both genera have in adulthood a highly variable but large number of segments of the opistothorax, although the largest number found in B. dailyi with 97 is much larger than in Emuella (52). B. dailyi is the only known species in this genus (i.e., the genus is monotypic).  Etymology  The genus name is derived from Balcoracana Creek in the Flinders Ranges, one of the sites where fossils of Balcoracania were collected. The species epithet dailyi is in honor of Dr. B. Daily, of the Geology Department, University of Adelaide.  Ecology  B. dailyi was an inhabitant of protected, shallow, marginal, marine environments. B. dailyi is usually the only trilobite present, but brachiopods may be present, too. Tubular burrows show it shared its ecosystem with soft-bodied animals.

It is one of the closest stars to the Sun, at a distance of 14.2 light years. Because of its proximity to the Earth it is a frequent object of study and much is known about its physical properties and composition. However, with an apparent magnitude of about 8.5 it is too faint to be seen with the naked eye. History This star's high proper motion was first documented by Benjamin Gould in 1885. At that time the star was identified as Cordoba Z.C. 23h 1584. As it lies very close to the origin of the astronomical right ascension coordinates during the 1950 epoch, it became the first star in both the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars and the Luyten Half-Second star catalogues. Properties The stellar classification of this star has been rated from M1.5V to M4.0V by various sources. Gliese 1 is estimated to have 45‚Äì48% of the Sun's mass and 46‚Äì48% of the Sun's radius. This star is suspected of being a BY Draconis-type variable star with the provisional variable star designation NSV 15017. It is also suspected of being a flare star. Like other flare stars, it emits X-rays. The temperatures of the layers of the atmosphere of this star have been measured. This star has been examined for an orbiting companion using speckle interferometry in the near infrared part of the spectrum. However, no companion was found to a magnitude limit of 10.5 at 1 AU from the primary, out to a magnitude limit of 12.5 at 10 AU. Radial velocity measurements have likewise failed to reveal the presence of a companion orbiting this star. This search excludes a planet with a few Earth masses orbiting in the habitable zone, or a Jupiter-mass planet orbiting at a radius of 1 AU or less. The radial velocity shows little or no variability, with a measurement precision of less than 20 m/s. The space velocity components of this star are U = +77.2, V = -99.5 and W = -35.6 km/s. It is orbiting through the Milky Way galaxy with an orbital eccentricity of 0.45, and a distance from the galactic core that varies from 3,510 to 9,150 parsecs. By comparison, the Sun is currently 8,500 parsecs from the core. Stars with high peculiar velocities are termed runaway stars. This star has a high peculiar velocity of 111.3 km/s, and the velocity vector for this star may link it with the Tucana-Horologium and/or the AB Doradus stellar associations.

Its northern terminus is at PA 150 northwest of Howard; its southern terminus is at the Maryland state line near Barnes Gap in Union Township. Two major destinations along this route are Raystown Lake near Huntingdon and the Pennsylvania State University at State College. In State College, Pennsylvania, the road divides into two one-way streets, going northbound on Beaver Avenue and going southbound on College Avenue. The Centre Area Transportation Authority uses these two routes for their Campus Loop and the Town Loop. As of November 24, 2008, a portion of PA 26 is concurrent with the northernmost stretch of Interstate 99 (I-99) north of State College, Pennsylvania between Pleasant Gap and I-80. The route also passes by two state penitentiaries: the State Correctional Institution ‚Äì Rockview in Pleasant Gap and State Correctional Institution ‚Äì Huntingdon, near Huntingdon. Route description =Fulton and Bedford counties= PA 26 northbound concurrent with US 30 Bus. westbound on Main Street in Everett PA 26 begins at the Maryland state line (Mason‚ÄìDixon line) in Union Township, Fulton County, where the road continues south into that state as North Orleans Road. From the state line, the route heads north on two-lane undivided South Clear Ridge Road through forested areas with some farm fields. PA 26 comes to an intersection with the western terminus of PA 484, where it makes a turn to the west. PA 26 enters Mann Township in Bedford County as Clear Ridge Road, heading northwest through woodland with some fields. The road curves north and winds through more rural land before making two sharp turns; first towards the west and second towards the north. The route winds north through forests, running through the community of Piney Creek. PA 26 passes through tracts of Buchanan State Forest, turning to the northwest. The route crosses into Southampton Township and reaches Millers Corner, where it turns northeast to remain along Clear Ridge Road. The route enters Monroe Township and leaves the state forest, continuing northeast through a mix of farmland and woodland. PA 26 makes an S-curve as it winds through rural land, passing through the communities of Five Forks and Chapmans Run. Farther north, the road reaches the residential community of Clearville, where it turns to the northwest. The route runs through farm fields with some woods, turning to the northeast. PA 26 continues north-northeast through a mix of farms and wooded areas, crossing into West Providence Township. The road passes through more rural land before heading northwest through more developed areas and passing under I-70/I-76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike). Following this, the route heads into the community of Earlston, where it passes homes. In Earlston, PA 26 heads west as East 4th Avenue before it makes a turn north onto State Street. The route curves northwest and crosses the Raystown Branch Juniata River into the borough of Everett, where it becomes South Hopewell Street. PA 26 runs through commercial areas and comes to an intersection with US 30 Bus., where it turns west to form a concurrency with that route on East Main Street. The two routes head west through the commercial downtown of Everett, curving to the southwest. PA 26 splits from US 30 Bus. by turning north-northwest onto North Spring Street. The route bends north and passes through residential areas. PA 26 passes under the US 30 freeway, at which point it leaves Everett for West Providence Township and becomes Raystown Road, passing through developed areas a short distance to the east of Tussey Mountain. The road curves north-northeast and comes to an intersection with Bud Shuster Bypass, which heads south to an interchange with the US 30 freeway. Here, the route turns north to remain along Raystown Road and crosses into Hopewell Township, passing a mix of homes and businesses in a narrow valley between Tussey Mountain to the west and Warrior Ridge to the east. The road continues north-northeast through a mix of farmland, woodland, and residences in the valley. Farther north, the valley gets wider as Warrior Ridge heads further to the east, and PA 26 continues north through agricultural areas with some woods and homes. The route turns east and comes to an intersection with the southern terminus of PA 36 before it curves to the southeast. The road passes through the residential community of Yellow Creek, where it crosses Yellow Creek. From here, PA 26 heads east through farmland with some woods, turning northeast and winding along. The route passes through the community of Eichelbergertown and turns east, winding through wooded areas with some fields and homes a short distance to the north of Yellow Creek. The road passes through a gap in River Mountain and crosses into Broad Top Township. Here, PA 26 intersects the northern terminus of PA 915, which crosses the Raystown Branch Juniata River into the borough of Hopewell. Past this intersection, the route turns north and runs through forested areas between River Mountain to the west and the Raystown Branch Juniata River to the east. The road enters Liberty Township and continues north-northeast through forests alongside the river before the road and river turn to the northwest. PA 26 passes through farmland before it makes a turn to the north and runs through wooded areas further west of the Raystown Branch Juniata River. The route comes to an intersection with the western terminus of PA 913 and makes a turn west to remain along Raystown Road. The road curves north and passes through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes in the Woodcock Valley, which is situated between Tussey Mountain to the west and Piney Ridge to the east. PA 26 curves north-northeast and continues through rural areas in the valley, passing east of the Captain Phillips Ranger Memorial before coming to an intersection with the southern terminus of PA 164. =Huntingdon County= PA 26 southbound in Bedford County PA 26 enters Hopewell Township in Huntingdon County and continues northeast as Raystown Road through farmland and woodland with some homes in the Woodcock Valley between Tussey Mountain to the west and Piney Ridge to the east, with Raystown Lake situated further to the east. The road passes through the communities of Cherrytown and Russellville before it crosses into Lincoln Township and intersects the western terminus of PA 994. Past this intersection, the route heads through agricultural areas with some woods and residences. PA 26 enters the borough of Marklesburg, where it is lined with homes. The road leaves Marklesburg for Penn Township and heads northeast through farmland with some wooded areas and residences. The route continues through rural land and crosses into Walker Township, where it makes an S-curve east and comes to the community of McConnellstown. Here, PA 26 curves northeast and runs through residential areas. The road continues through developed areas with some rural land and enters Smithfield Township. The route heads into business areas and gains a center left-turn lane briefly before becoming a divided highway for a short distance. PA 26 becomes undivided as it comes to an interchange with US 22. Following this interchange, the route becomes Pennsylvania Avenue and curves to the east-southeast, passing between State Correctional Institution ‚Äì Huntingdon to the north and residential areas to the south. The road heads southeast into the community of Smithfield and heads southeast between the Juniata River to the northeast and homes to the southwest. PA 26 turns northeast onto Penn Street and crosses the Juniata River into the borough of Huntingdon. Here, the road becomes a divided highway and curves east, passing under Norfolk Southern's Pittsburgh Line. The route becomes undivided again and heads east-southeast through the residential and commercial downtown of Huntingdon, passing south of the Huntingdon County Courthouse. PA 26 turns north-northeast onto 2nd Street and passes homes, soon turning east onto Standing Stone Avenue and curving northeast past more development. PA 26 leaves Huntingdon for Oneida Township and becomes Standing Stone Road, heading through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes a short distance west of Standing Stone Creek. The road winds through more forested areas and curves north to cross the creek before passing east of a golf course. The route turns northeast and then north as it runs through wooded areas with some residences, passing through the community of Center Union. PA 26 continues through forests with some farm fields and development, curving northeast and crossing the Standing Stone Creek again. The road runs through more rural land and passes through the community of Donation before it enters Miller Township. The route continues northeast through woodland and farmland with some homes, with the Standing Stone Creek becoming closely parallel to the southeast before the route heads through the community of Jackson Center. PA 26 curves north alongside the creek into forested areas. The road winds north through a mix of farmland and woodland, crossing into Jackson Township. The route turns northeast and heads through agricultural areas, reaching an intersection with PA 305 in the community of Ennisville. Here, PA 26 turns east to form a concurrency with PA 305 on Greenwood Road, crossing the Standing Stone Creek and running through more rural areas with some homes. PA 305 splits from PA 26 in McAlevys Fort by turning to the southeast, while PA 26 turns north as McAlevys Fort Road and crosses the Standing Stone Creek again. The road curves northwest and passes through farmland before it heads into forested areas with some homes. The route passes southwest of Whipple Dam State Park before it crosses into Barree Township. At this point, PA 26 begins to ascend Tussey Mountain and heads into Rothrock State Forest, following a winding path and turning northwest and then northeast as it climbs the mountain. =Centre County= left At the summit of Tussey Mountain, PA 26 comes to a truck check station in both directions and a scenic overlook on the southbound side, entering Ferguson Township in Centre County. The road begins to descend the mountain, coming to a northbound runaway truck ramp before it leaves Rothrock State Forest and makes a hairpin turn to the southwest. The route turns north and reaches the base of the mountain, where it enters the Nittany Valley and heads into the residential community of Pine Grove Mills as South Water Street. PA 26 comes to an intersection with PA 45, at which point it turns east to form a concurrency with that route on East Pine Grove Road. The road soon curves northeast and passes more homes along with a few businesses. The roadway leaves Pine Grove Mills and PA 45 splits from PA 26 by turning to the northeast. PA 26 becomes West College Avenue and curves north and then northwest, heading through farmland with some residences and commercial establishments and gaining a center left-turn lane. The road heads past a mix of homes and businesses, curving north and then northeast. PA 26 enters the borough of State College, where it splits into the one-way pair of West Beaver Avenue northbound and West College Avenue southbound upon intersecting South Buckhout Street. The one-way pair, which carries two lanes in each direction, passes through residential areas. The route heads into the downtown area of State College, which contains businesses and high-rise buildings consisting of mixed residential and commercial uses. Here, PA 26 comes to an intersection with US 322 Bus., at which point West College Avenue becomes the southeast border of the University Park campus of Pennsylvania State University. Following this intersection, the one-way pair continues northeast through the downtown area to the southeast of the university campus. At the intersection with Allen Street to the southeast of Old Main on the Pennsylvania State University campus, the route becomes East Beaver Avenue northbound and East College Avenue southbound. PA 26 heads through more of downtown State College, with the university campus to the northwest, before the one-way pair ends at the High Street intersection. At this point, PA 26 continues northeast on four-lane undivided East College Avenue and comes to an interchange with University Drive that serves the University Park campus of Pennsylvania State University, including Beaver Stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. Past this interchange, the road heads through woods and leaves State College for College Township, where it gains a center left-turn lane and passes through a mix of homes and businesses, running through the community of Millbrook. The route becomes a four-lane divided highway and reaches an interchange with the US 322 freeway, where the route becomes concurrent with PA 144 Truck. Past the US 322 interchange, PA 26 becomes a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane and runs through wooded residential areas. Farther northeast, the route heads into business areas and becomes parallel with a Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad line to the southeast of the road. PA 26 comes to an intersection with the southern terminus of PA 150, where it turns northeast to remain along East College Avenue, a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane that continues to parallel the railroad line. The road passes southeast of the Nittany Mall before it heads between residential areas to the northwest and industrial areas to the southeast. The route narrows to two lanes as it heads into a mix of farmland and woodland and enters Benner Township, where it passes southeast of State Correctional Institution ‚Äì Rockview. PA 26 crosses the Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad line and continues northeast through rural areas with some development as West College Avenue, gaining a center left-turn lane. The road crosses into Spring Township and heads into the community of Pleasant Gap, where it becomes two lanes again and passes through residential areas with some businesses. The route comes to an intersection with PA 144, where PA 144 Truck ends, and becomes East College Avenue, heading past more development. The road leaves Pleasant Gap and runs through a mix of farmland and commercial development, crossing a Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad spur. PA 26 comes to an intersection with the southern terminus of PA 64, where PA 64 continues northeast along East College Avenue and PA 26 turns north onto a two-lane expressway. The route heads northwest through agricultural areas and passes over a Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad spur before it comes to an interchange with I-99/US 220. At this point, PA 26 heads north along with I-99/US 220 on a four-lane freeway, passing north-northwest through farmland and coming to an interchange with PA 550 to the east of the borough of Bellefonte. The freeway continues through rural land and curves northeast before it ends, where I-99 ends and US 220 and PA 26 continue northeast at-grade along a four-lane divided highway. The road comes to an interchange with I-80 and the northern terminus of US 220 Alt., at which point US 220 splits from PA 26 by heading east along I-80. At this interchange, PA 26 enters Marion Township and continues northeast along two-lane undivided Jacksonville Road, passing through farmland with some woods and homes in a valley between Bald Eagle Mountain to the northwest and a ridge to the southeast, with I-80/US 220 running parallel to the southeast within the valley. The route continues northeast through rural land before it turns northwest onto Walnut Street, where it heads into forested areas and winds to the north as it passes through a gap in Bald Eagle Mountain, crossing into Howard Township. The road curves northwest and enters the borough of Howard, where it passes through residential areas and comes to a bridge over a Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad line. The route continues past more homes and some businesses before it leaves Howard for Howard Township again, heading into Bald Eagle State Park and crossing over the Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir. PA 26 continues northwest and comes to its northern terminus at an intersection with PA 150. Major intersections PA 26 Truck =Huntingdon County= There are 2 truck routes of PA 26 in Huntingdon County. The first bypasses a weight-restricted bridge over Muddy Run in Huntingdon borough on which trucks over 36 tons and combination loads over 37 tons are prohibited. The second bypasses a weight- restricted bridge over Murray Run on which trucks over 35 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. They were both created and established in September 2013. =Centre County= The truck route in Centre County bypasses a weight-restricted bridge over Lick Run on which trucks over 36 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. It follows I-80, US 220 Alt, and PA 150 and was signed in 2013.

Examples of such qualitative properties are numbers of fixed points and periodic orbits (but not their periods). Unlike Lyapunov stability, which considers perturbations of initial conditions for a fixed system, structural stability deals with perturbations of the system itself. Variants of this notion apply to systems of ordinary differential equations, vector fields on smooth manifolds and flows generated by them, and diffeomorphisms. Structurally stable systems were introduced by Aleksandr Andronov and Lev Pontryagin in 1937 under the name \\"syst√®mes grossiers\\", or rough systems. They announced a characterization of rough systems in the plane, the Andronov‚ÄìPontryagin criterion. In this case, structurally stable systems are typical, they form an open dense set in the space of all systems endowed with appropriate topology. In higher dimensions, this is no longer true, indicating that typical dynamics can be very complex (cf strange attractor). An important class of structurally stable systems in arbitrary dimensions is given by Anosov diffeomorphisms and flows.  Definition  Let G be an open domain in Rn with compact closure and smooth (n‚àí1)-dimensional boundary. Consider the space X1(G) consisting of restrictions to G of C1 vector fields on Rn that are transversal to the boundary of G and are inward oriented. This space is endowed with the C1 metric in the usual fashion. A vector field F ‚àà X1(G) is weakly structurally stable if for any sufficiently small perturbation F1, the corresponding flows are topologically equivalent on G: there exists a homeomorphism h: G ‚Üí G which transforms the oriented trajectories of F into the oriented trajectories of F1. If, moreover, for any Œµ > 0 the homeomorphism h may be chosen to be C0 Œµ-close to the identity map when F1 belongs to a suitable neighborhood of F depending on Œµ, then F is called (strongly) structurally stable. These definitions extend in a straightforward way to the case of n-dimensional compact smooth manifolds with boundary. Andronov and Pontryagin originally considered the strong property. Analogous definitions can be given for diffeomorphisms in place of vector fields and flows: in this setting, the homeomorphism h must be a topological conjugacy. It is important to note that topological equivalence is realized with a loss of smoothness: the map h cannot, in general, be a diffeomorphism. Moreover, although topological equivalence respects the oriented trajectories, unlike topological conjugacy, it is not time-compatible. Thus the relevant notion of topological equivalence is a considerable weakening of the na√Øve C1 conjugacy of vector fields. Without these restrictions, no continuous time system with fixed points or periodic orbits could have been structurally stable. Weakly structurally stable systems form an open set in X1(G), but it is unknown whether the same property holds in the strong case.  Examples  Necessary and sufficient conditions for the structural stability of C1 vector fields on the unit disk D that are transversal to the boundary and on the two-sphere S2 have been determined in the foundational paper of Andronov and Pontryagin. According to the Andronov‚ÄìPontryagin criterion, such fields are structurally stable if and only if they have only finitely many singular points (equilibrium states) and periodic trajectories (limit cycles), which are all non-degenerate (hyperbolic), and do not have saddle-to-saddle connections. Furthermore, the non-wandering set of the system is precisely the union of singular points and periodic orbits. In particular, structurally stable vector fields in two dimensions cannot have homoclinic trajectories, which enormously complicate the dynamics, as discovered by Henri Poincar√©. Structural stability of non-singular smooth vector fields on the torus can be investigated using the theory developed by Poincar√© and Arnaud Denjoy. Using the Poincar√© recurrence map, the question is reduced to determining structural stability of diffeomorphisms of the circle. As a consequence of the Denjoy theorem, an orientation preserving C2 diffeomorphism ∆í of the circle is structurally stable if and only if its rotation number is rational, œÅ(∆í) = p/q, and the periodic trajectories, which all have period q, are non-degenerate: the Jacobian of ∆íq at the periodic points is different from 1, see circle map. Dmitri Anosov discovered that hyperbolic automorphisms of the torus, such as the Arnold's cat map, are structurally stable. He then generalized this statement to a wider class of systems, which have since been called Anosov diffeomorphisms and Anosov flows. One celebrated example of Anosov flow is given by the geodesic flow on a surface of constant negative curvature, cf Hadamard billiards.  History and significance  Structural stability of the system provides a justification for applying the qualitative theory of dynamical systems to analysis of concrete physical systems. The idea of such qualitative analysis goes back to the work of Henri Poincar√© on the three-body problem in celestial mechanics. Around the same time, Aleksandr Lyapunov rigorously investigated stability of small perturbations of an individual system. In practice, the evolution law of the system (i.e. the differential equations) is never known exactly, due to the presence of various small interactions. It is, therefore, crucial to know that basic features of the dynamics are the same for any small perturbation of the \\"model\\" system, whose evolution is governed by a certain known physical law. Qualitative analysis was further developed by George Birkhoff in the 1920s, but was first formalized with introduction of the concept of rough system by Andronov and Pontryagin in 1937. This was immediately applied to analysis of physical systems with oscillations by Andronov, Witt, and Khaikin. The term \\"structural stability\\" is due to Solomon Lefschetz, who oversaw translation of their monograph into English. Ideas of structural stability were taken up by Stephen Smale and his school in the 1960s in the context of hyperbolic dynamics. Earlier, Marston Morse and Hassler Whitney initiated and Ren√© Thom developed a parallel theory of stability for differentiable maps, which forms a key part of singularity theory. Thom envisaged applications of this theory to biological systems. Both Smale and Thom worked in direct contact with Maur√≠cio Peixoto, who developed Peixoto's theorem in the late 1950s. When Smale started to develop the theory of hyperbolic dynamical systems, he hoped that structurally stable systems would be \\"typical\\". This would have been consistent with the situation in low dimensions: dimension two for flows and dimension one for diffeomorphisms. However, he soon found examples of vector fields on higher-dimensional manifolds that cannot be made structurally stable by an arbitrarily small perturbation (such examples have been later constructed on manifolds of dimension three). This means that in higher dimensions, structurally stable systems are not dense. In addition, a structurally stable system may have transversal homoclinic trajectories of hyperbolic saddle closed orbits and infinitely many periodic orbits, even though the phase space is compact. The closest higher-dimensional analogue of structurally stable systems considered by Andronov and Pontryagin is given by the Morse‚ÄìSmale systems.

It is located about 6 miles (11 km) southeast of the centre of Nottingham. It sits on a small, broad hilltop about 200 feet above sea level which is set in the wider undulating boulder clay that characterises the area south of Nottingham. Keyworth is twinned with the French town of Feignies. Demographics A 2001 census which was conducted indicates that the civil parish had a population of 6,920, reducing to 6,733 at the 2011 census. Crime Keyworth was the home of Colette Aram who was murdered by Paul Stewart Hutchinson in 1983. Transport The bus company Trentbarton operates The Keyworth service from Keyworth to Nottingham via Plumtree, Tollerton, Edwalton and West Bridgford, daily, from early in the morning until around midnight (with additional late-night buses on Fridays and Saturdays). Keyworth is approximately 8 miles to the closest railway station, Nottingham railway station, Keyworth once had its own station (now on the Old Dalby test track) but it was closed in the 60s. The closest airport located is 17 miles to the west of Keyworth East Midlands Airport. History and development Keyworth is first mentioned in writing in the Domesday Book dated 1086, though recent archaeological finds have discovered Roman artefacts in the parish outskirts suggesting human inhabitation of the area as far back as 800 AD. Keyworth originally developed as an agricultural community with the great majority of its inhabitants being farmers and field labourers. Later, frame- knitting gave rise to local employment and expansion in the 1880s. Listed buildings in the village includes two grade II barns dating from the 17th century, one late 18th century house built in the Regency style, two early 19th century cottages on Main Street, and two grade II Former framework knitters' workshops. In the early 20th century the Midland Railway came through Plumtree from Nottingham Midland station & along the north east of Keyworth, giving the village an accessible rail route throughout the railway network, though this luxury only lasted about 70 years. The station at Plumtree was open for passengers from 1880 to 1949. Significant expansion took place throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s with Keyworth effectively becoming a commuter town for Nottingham. The population has been falling slightly in recent years. A fuller account can be found at the website of the Keyworth & District History Society. Churches Church of St Mary Magdalene The Church of St Mary Magdalene dates from the 14th and 15th centuries and is Grade I listed. A Methodist church, Baptist church, Catholic church and a United Reformed church are also located in the village. Education and schools The South Wolds Academy & Sixth Form (formerly known as South Wolds Community School) is a Secondary School and Sixth Form with academy status located on Church Drive in Keyworth, Nottingham. There are also three primary schools located in Keyworth (Crossdale Primary School, Keyworth Primary & Nursery School, Willow Brook Primary School). Recreation The Keyworth Show takes place each summer, on the second Saturday of July which includes a horticultural show, fairground and various displays. This all takes place on the playing fields described below. Keyworth Leisure Centre is the areas main swimming pool which is located next to the site of the South Wolds Academy. The Rectory playing field near the parish church is on the site of an ancient medieval ridge and furrow system. This sometimes made running a rather precarious business for the outfielders of Keyworth Cricket Club who played their home matches on this field until 2012 before moving to the Platt Lane playing fields. In the season 2006 Keyworth Cricket Club players created league records for the most runs in a season and the most centuries in a season. It was the most successful season in the history of the club, which dates back to 1814. An activity park aimed at older children was installed in 2016 on the field and a play park for younger children is across the road in front of Keyworth Primary School. The Keyworth Turkey Trot is a half-marathon road race which the 1st Keyworth Scout Group has been holding annually since 1983, normally on the second Sunday in December. It attracts hundreds of runners. An additional set of playing fields, the home of Keyworth United Community Football Club and Keyworth Cricket Club, is located on Platt Lane. There is a skate park located on Platt Lane which is made up of concrete ramps on a concrete base. Stanton-on-the-Wolds Golf Club is situated about a mile from the village centre. Local groups include scouting, amateur dramatics, bridge, choir, conservation, history, archery, photography, a Martial Arts club (Sanda / Sanshou / Wing Chun), a Karate club (South Notts Shotokan Karate Club) and also a Kickboxing club (Professional Kickboxing Association ‚Äì Keyworth). The Keyworth and District Branch of the U3A was established in 2009 and rapidly enrolled over 200 members. By the middle of 2011 it had reached its self-imposed limit of 400 members. It formed more than twenty study and activity groups, such as Play-Reading, Architecture, Family History, French, German, Cycling, Walking, Painting, Book-Reading, Bobbin Lace, Singing for Fun, Ukulele Group, Humour, Wildlife and Bird-Watching. The Keyworth Village Quiz is an annual quiz held in the Keyworth Village Hall between teams representing local organisations. The quiz, which began in 1976, runs for 7 or 8 weeks with teams competing in University Challenge style head to head matches. Feargus The Musical, a musical based on the political life of Feargus O'Connor, an Irish Chartist leader, was first performed at the South Wolds Academy in November 2018. The musical was written by Keyworth resident Brian Lund and performed by a local cast including dancers from the Keyworth School of Theatre Dance. A second run with the same cast was held at the Nottingham Arts Theatre in November 2019. Commerce and amenities The primary healthcare service in Keyworth is a large NHS health centre. There are also two dental practices. The main shopping precincts are located in the Square, Main Street and the Parade. There is also a smaller set of shops on Nottingham Road. Keyworth's range of shops includes a post office, pharmacies, small supermarkets, convenience stores, a hardware store, hairdressers, newsagents, butchers, dry-cleaners and florists. A Bird's Bakery was opened in December 2018. There are no large supermarkets located in Keyworth meaning that many residents commute to other local large supermarkets such as ASDA West Bridgford, Morrisons in Gamston and Tesco in Long Eaton. There was a plan to build a medium-sized Tesco supermarket in Keyworth on the previously derelict Selby Lane site which formerly had a small petrol station located at the site; however, this proposal was declined in March 2010, the proposed plan being rejected by Rushcliffe Borough Council. There are two Co-op Food stores in the village; a small store in The Square and a bigger one opposite The Parade on Wolds Drive. There are two veterinary surgeries; Davison's on The Parade and Rushcliffe Veterinary Centre on Main Street. There are three public houses, the oldest being the Salutation Inn, which was established in the late 15th century. There are three Chinese takeaways, two fish-and-chip shops, two Indian takeaways and a pizza takeaway. Keyworth is home to the headquarters of the British Geological Survey, located since 1976 on the site of the former Mary Ward Teacher Training College on Nicker Hill in the North-Eastern quadrant of the village. The college opened in 1968 and was a Roman Catholic institution founded by the Loreto Sisters, also known as the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

These are used in various applications, for example hashing, public-key cryptography, and search of prime factors in large numbers. For relatively small numbers, it is possible to just apply trial division to each successive odd number. Prime sieves are almost always faster.  Prime sieves  A prime sieve or prime number sieve is a fast type of algorithm for finding primes. There are many prime sieves. The simple sieve of Eratosthenes (250s BCE), the sieve of Sundaram (1934), the still faster but more complicated sieve of Atkin (2004), and various wheel sieves are most common. A prime sieve works by creating a list of all integers up to a desired limit and progressively removing composite numbers (which it directly generates) until only primes are left. This is the most efficient way to obtain a large range of primes; however, to find individual primes, direct primality tests are more efficient. Furthermore, based on the sieve formalisms, some integer sequences are constructed which also could be used for generating primes in certain intervals.  Large primes  For the large primes used in cryptography, Provable primes can be generated using variants of Pocklington primality test or Probable primes using standard probabilistic primality tests such as the Baillie‚ÄìPSW primality test or the Miller‚ÄìRabin primality test. Both the provable and probable primality tests use modular exponentiation, a comparatively expensive computation. To reduce the computational cost, the integers are first checked for any small prime divisors using either sieves similar to the Sieve of Eratosthenes or Trial division. Integers with special forms, such as Mersenne prime or Fermat primes, can be efficiently tested for primality if the prime factorization of p ‚àí 1 or p + 1 is known. Complexity The sieve of Eratosthenes is generally considered the easiest sieve to implement, but it is not the fastest in the sense of the number of operations for a given range for large sieving ranges. In its usual standard implementation (which may include basic wheel factorization for small primes), it can find all the primes up to N in time O( N \\\\log \\\\log N ), while basic implementations of the sieve of Atkin and wheel sieves run in linear time O(N). Special versions of the Sieve of Eratosthenes using wheel sieve principles can have this same linear O(N) time complexity. A special version of the Sieve of Atkin and some special versions of wheel sieves which may include sieving using the methods from the Sieve of Eratosthenes can run in sublinear time complexity of O(N / \\\\log \\\\log N). Note that just because an algorithm has decreased asymptotic time complexity does not mean that a practical implementation runs faster than an algorithm with a greater asymptotic time complexity: If in order to achieve that lesser asymptotic complexity the individual operations have a constant factor of increased time complexity that may be many times greater than for the simpler algorithm, it may never be possible within practical sieving ranges for the advantage of the reduced number of operations for reasonably large ranges to make up for this extra cost in time per operation. Some sieving algorithms, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes with large amounts of wheel factorization, take much less time for smaller ranges than their asymptotic time complexity would indicate because they have large negative constant offsets in their complexity and thus don't reach that asymptotic complexity until far beyond practical ranges. For instance, the Sieve of Eratosthenes with a combination of wheel factorization and pre-culling using small primes up to 19 uses time of about a factor of two less than that predicted for the total range for a range of 1019, which total range takes hundreds of core-years to sieve for the best of sieve algorithms. The simple naive \\"one large sieving array\\" sieves of any of these sieve types take memory space of about O(N), which means that 1) they are very limited in the sieving ranges they can handle to the amount of RAM (memory) available and 2) that they are typically quite slow since memory access speed typically becomes the speed bottleneck more than computational speed once the array size grows beyond the size of the CPU caches. The normally implemented page segmented sieves of both Eratosthenes and Atkin take space O(N / \\\\log N) plus small sieve segment buffers which are normally sized to fit within the CPU cache; page segmented wheel sieves including special variations of the Sieve of Eratosthenes typically take much more space than this by a significant factor in order to store the required wheel representations; Pritchard's variation of the linear time complexity sieve of Eratosthenes/wheel sieve takes O(N^{1/2} \\\\log \\\\log N / \\\\log N) space. The better time complexity special version of the Sieve of Atkin takes space N^{1/2+o(1)}. Sorenson shows an improvement to the wheel sieve that takes even less space at O(N /((\\\\log N)^{L} \\\\log \\\\log N)) for any L > 1. However, the following is a general observation: the more the amount of memory is reduced, the greater the constant factor increase in the cost in time per operation even though the asymptotic time complexity may remain the same, meaning that the memory-reduced versions may run many times slower than the non-memory- reduced versions by quite a large factor.

The first constitution came into force in 1925. The current constitution was drafted and approved in 2005. History Iraq's first constitution, which established a constitutional monarchy, entered into force under the auspices of a British military occupation in 1925 and remained in effect until the 1958 revolution established a republic. Interim constitutions were adopted in 1958, 1964, 1968, and 1970, the last remaining in effect de jure until the Transitional Administrative Law was adopted in 2003 after the fall of Saddam Hussein. In 1990, a draft constitution was prepared but never promulgated due to the onset of the Gulf War. The current constitution was approved by a referendum that took place on 15 October 2005. The constitution was drafted in 2005 by members of the Iraqi Constitution Drafting Committee to replace the Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period (the \\"TAL\\"). The TAL was drafted between December 2003 and March 2004 by the Iraqi Governing Council, an appointed body that was selected by the Coalition Provisional Authority after the Iraq War and occupation of Iraq by the United States and Coalition forces. Under a compromise brokered before the referendum, it was agreed that the first parliament that was to be elected pursuant to the new constitution would institute a Constitutional Review Committee with a view to determine whether the constitution should be amended. Any amendments agreed would have to be ratified by a similar referendum to the one that originally approved it. After this agreement was entered into, the Sunni-majority Iraqi Islamic Party agreed to back a Yes vote in the referendum that took place on October 15, 2005. The Constitutional Review Committee was constituted by the Iraqi parliament on 25 September 2006. Electoral Commission officials said at a news conference that 78 percent of voters backed the charter and 21 percent opposed it. Of the 18 provinces, two recorded \\"No\\" votes greater than two thirds, one province short of a veto. A two-thirds rejection vote in three of the country's 18 provinces (of which three‚ÄîMosul, Anbar, and Salahaddin‚Äîare thought to include Sunni majorities) would have required the dissolution of the Assembly, fresh elections, and the recommencement of the entire drafting process. Turnout in the referendum was 63 percent, commission officials had previously said. The drafting and adoption of the new Constitution was not without controversy, however, as sectarian tensions in Iraq figured heavily in the process. The chairman of the drafting committee, Humam Hamoudi, regularly made statements which were interpreted as meaning that there would be no compromises on Sunni demands.International Crisis Group, \\"Unmaking Iraq: A Constitutional Process Gone Awry\\" ICG Middle East Policy Briefing 26 September 2005. The deadline for the conclusion of drafting was extended on four occasions because of the lack of consensus on religious language. In the end, only three of the 15 Sunni members of the drafting committee attended the signing ceremony, and none of them signed it. Sunni leaders were split as to whether to support the constitution. Saleh al-Mutlaq, the chief Sunni negotiator, urged followers of his Hewar Front to vote against it, but the biggest Sunni block, the Iraqi Accord Front did support the document after receiving promises that it would be reviewed and amended, taking into account their views. A Constitution Amendment Committee has been set up in this regard, but the progress has been slow. Notably, the same figure who chaired the drafting committee, Humam Hamoudi, is chairing the amendment committee as well. The text of the proposed constitution was read to the National Assembly on Sunday 28 August 2005. It describes the state as a \\"democratic, federal, representative republic\\" (art. 1) (however, the division of powers is to be deferred until the first parliament convenes), and a \\"multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-sect country\\" (art. 3). =Drafting= The Transitional National Assembly, which was elected in January 2005 pursuant to the Coalition Provisional Authority's Transitional Administrative Law, appointed a Constitutional Committee for the purpose of preparing a draft constitution by 15 August 2005. The Committee was initially made up of 55 members, all of whom were drawn from the Transitional National Assembly, but its membership was eventually expanded beyond the Assembly's numbers, in order to allow representatives from the Sunni Arab community to participate (given that the latter had boycotted the elections that gave rise to the Transitional National Assembly). According to the Transitional Administrative Law, the Constitutional Committee was obliged to complete its work by 15 August 2005, and for the draft to be submitted to a referendum by 15 October 2005. However, by the beginning of August 2005, all parties were in agreement that a final agreement on some of the Constitution's most important elements, including federalism, was still far from complete. As a result, the Committee was effectively dissolved and replaced by an ad hoc body (referred to as the \\"Leadership Council\\"), which was composed of approximately 6 members and which continued to negotiate the constitution's final terms until three days before the referendum date. = Adoption = The Constitution was adopted on 15 October 2005 in a referendum of the people. = Amendment = Under a compromise brokered before the referendum, it was agreed that the first parliament that was to be elected pursuant to the new constitution would institute a Constitutional Review Committee with a view to determine whether the constitution should be amended. Any amendments agreed would have to be ratified by a similar referendum to the one that originally approved it. After this agreement was entered into, the Sunni-majority Iraqi Islamic Party agreed to back a Yes vote in the referendum that took place on 15 October 2005. The Constitutional Review Committee was constituted by the Iraqi parliament on 25 September 2006. On 18 September 2005, several changes to the text of the constitution were approved by Iraq's parliament, and will be included in the version published for ratification by the public. Also, a new compromise was made which caused many Sunni groups to support the constitution. Many of the links to the Constitution use the 24 August 2005 AP wire translation; however, the American Chronicle uses a slightly different translation dated 12 October 2005.

It begins by stating that the republic's federal system is made up of the capital, regions, decentralized provinces, and local administrations. ::*Part One: Regions The country's future Regions are to be established from its current 18 governorates (or provinces). Any single province, or group of provinces, is entitled to request that it be recognized as a region, with such a request being made by either two-thirds of the members of the provincial councils in the provinces involved or by one-tenth of the registered voters in the province(s) in question. ::*Part Two: Provinces not organized into a Region Provinces that are unwilling or unable to join a region still enjoy enough autonomy and resources to enable them to manage their own internal affairs according to the principle of administrative decentralization. With the two parties' approval, federal government responsibilities may be delegated to the provinces, or vice versa. These decentralized provinces are headed by Provincial Governors, elected by Provincial Councils. The administrative levels within a province are defined, in descending order, as districts, counties and villages. ::*Part Three: The Capital Article 120 states that Baghdad is the Capital of the Republic, within the boundaries of Baghdad Governorate. The constitution makes no specific reference to the status of the capital and its surrounding governorate within the federal structure, stating merely that its status is to be regulated by law. ::*Part Four: Local Administrations Consisting solely of Article 121, Part Four simply states that the constitution guarantees the administrative, political, cultural, and educational rights of the country's various ethnic groups (Turkmens, Assyrians, etc.), and that legislation will be adopted to regulate those rights.

The electrodes do not move the animal directly, as if controlling a robot; rather, they signal a direction or action desired by the human operator and then stimulate the animal's reward centres if the animal complies. These are sometimes called bio-robots or robo-animals. They can be considered to be cyborgs as they combine electronic devices with an organic life form. Because of the surgery required, and the moral and ethical issues involved, there has been criticism aimed at the use of remote control animals, especially regarding animal welfare and animal rights. A similar, non-invasive application has been reported which stimulates the brain with ultrasound to control the animal. Some applications (used primarily for dogs) use vibrations or sound to control the movements of the animals. Several species of animals have been successfully controlled remotely. These include moths, beetles, cockroaches, rats, dogfish sharks, mice and pigeons. Remote control animals can be directed and used as working animals for search and rescue operations or various other uses. Mammals =Rats= Several studies have examined the remote control of rats using micro-electodes implanted into their brains and rely on stimulating the reward centre of the rat. Three electrodes are implanted; two in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus which conveys facial sensory information from the left and right whiskers, and a third in the medial forebrain bundle which is involved in the reward process of the rat. This third electrode is used to give a rewarding electrical stimulus to the brain when the rat makes the correct move to the left or right. During training, the operator stimulates the left or right electrode of the rat making it \\"feel\\" a touch to the corresponding set of whiskers, as though it had come in contact with an obstacle. If the rat then makes the correct response, the operator rewards the rat by stimulating the third electrode. In 2002, a team of scientists at the State University of New York remotely controlled rats from a laptop up to 500 m away. The rats could be instructed to turn left or right, climb trees and ladders, navigate piles of rubble, and jump from different heights. They could even be commanded into brightly lit areas, which rats usually avoid. It has been suggested that the rats could be used to carry cameras to people trapped in disaster zones. In 2013, researchers reported the development of a radio-telemetry system to remotely control free-roaming rats with a range of 200 m. The backpack worn by the rat includes the mainboard and an FM transmitter-receiver, which can generate biphasic microcurrent pulses. All components in the system are commercially available and are fabricated from surface mount devices to reduce the size (25 x 15 x 2 mm) and weight (10 g with battery). Ethics and welfare concerns Concerns have been raised about the ethics of such studies. Even one of the pioneers in this area of study, Sanjiv Talwar, said \\"There's going to have to be a wide debate to see whether this is acceptable or not\\" and \\"There are some ethical issues here which I can't deny.\\" Elsewhere he was quoted as saying \\"The idea sounds a little creepy.\\" Some oppose the idea of placing living creatures under direct human command. \\"It's appalling, and yet another example of how the human species instrumentalises other species,\\" says Gill Langley of the Dr Hadwen Trust based in Hertfordshire (UK), which funds alternatives to animal-based research. Gary Francione, an expert in animal welfare law at Rutgers University School of Law, says \\"The animal is no longer functioning as an animal,\\" as the rat is operating under someone's control. And the issue goes beyond whether or not the stimulations are compelling or rewarding the rat to act. \\"There's got to be a level of discomfort in implanting these electrodes,\\" he says, which may be difficult to justify. Talwar stated that the animal's \\"native intelligence\\" can stop it from performing some directives but with enough stimulation, this hesitation can sometimes be overcome, but occasionally cannot. Non-invasive method Researchers at Harvard University have created a brain-to-brain interface (BBI) between a human and a Sprague-Dawley rat. Simply by thinking the appropriate thought, the BBI allows the human to control the rat's tail. The human wears an EEG-based brain-to-computer interface (BCI), while the anesthetised rat is equipped with a focused ultrasound (FUS) computer-to-brain interface (CBI). FUS is a technology that allows the researchers to excite a specific region of neurons in the rat's brain using an ultrasound signal (350 kHz ultrasound frequency, tone burst duration of 0.5 ms, pulse repetition frequency of 1 kHz, given for 300 ms duration). The main advantage of FUS is that, unlike most brain-stimulation techniques, it is non-invasive. Whenever the human looks at a specific pattern (strobe light flicker) on a computer screen, the BCI communicates a command to the rat's CBI, which causes ultrasound to be beamed into the region of the rat's motor cortex responsible for tail movement. The researchers report that the human BCI has an accuracy of 94%, and that it generally takes around 1.5 s from the human looking at the screen to movement of the rat's tail. Another system that non-invasively controls rats uses ultrasonic, epidermal and LED photic stimulators on the back. The system receives commands to deliver specified electrical stimulations to the hearing, pain and visual senses of the rat respectively. The three stimuli work in groups for the rat navigation. Other researchers have dispensed with human remote control of rats and instead uses a General Regression Neural Network algorithm to analyse and model controlling of human operations. =Dogs= Dogs are often used in disaster relief, at crime scenes and on the battlefield, but it's not always easy for them to hear the commands of their handlers. A command module which contains a microprocessor, wireless radio, GPS receiver and an attitude and heading reference system (essentially a gyroscope) can be fitted to dogs. The command module delivers vibration or sound commands (delivered by the handler over the radio) to the dog to guide it in a certain direction or to perform certain actions. The overall success rate of the control system is 86.6%. =Mice= Researchers responsible for developing remote control of a pigeon using brain implants conducted a similar successful experiment on mice in 2005. Invertebrates In 1967, Franz Huber pioneered electrical stimulation to the brain of insects and showed that mushroom body stimulation elicits complex behaviours, including the inhibition of locomotion. =Cockroaches= The US-based company Backyard Brains released the \\"RoboRoach\\", a remote controlled cockroach kit that they refer to as \\"The world's first commercially available cyborg\\". The project started as a University of Michigan biomedical engineering student senior design project in 2010 and was launched as an available beta product on 25 February 2011. The RoboRoach was officially released into production via a TED talk at the TED Global conference, and via the crowdsourcing website Kickstarter in 2013, the kit allows students to use microstimulation to momentarily control the movements of a walking cockroach (left and right) using a bluetooth-enabled smartphone as the controller. The RoboRoach was the first kit available to the general public for the remote control of an animal and was funded by the United States' National Institute of Mental Health as a device to serve as a teaching aid to promote an interest in neuroscience. This funding was due to the similarities between the RoboRoach microstimulation, and the microstimulation used in the treatments of Parkinson's disease (Deep Brain Stimulation) and deafness (Cochlear implants) in humans. Several animal welfare organizations including the RSPCA and PETA have expressed concerns about the ethics and welfare of animals in this project. Another group at North Carolina State University has developed a remote control cockroach. Researchers at NCSU have programmed a path for cockroaches to follow while tracking their location with an Xbox Kinect. The system automatically adjusted the cockroach's movements to ensure it stayed on the prescribed path. =Beetles= Cyborg beetles developed based on Zophobas morio (left) and Mecynorrhina torquata (right) In 2009, remote control of the flight movements of the Cotinus texana and the much larger Mecynorrhina torquata beetles has been achieved during experiments funded by the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The weight of the electronics and battery meant that only Mecynorrhina was strong enough to fly freely under radio control. A specific series of pulses sent to the optic lobes of the insect encouraged it to take flight. The average length of flights was just 45 seconds, although one lasted for more than 30 minutes. A single pulse caused the beetle to land again. Stimulation of basilar flight muscles allowed the controller to direct the insect left or right, although this was successful on only 75% of stimulations. After each maneuver, the beetles quickly righted themselves and continued flying parallel to the ground. In 2015, researchers was able to fine tune the beetle steering in flight by changing the pulse train applied on the wing-folding muscle. Recently, scientists from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, have demonstrated graded turning and backward walking in a small darkling beetle (Zophobas morio), which is 2 cm to 2.5 cm long and weight only 1 g including the electronic backpack and battery. It has been suggested the beetles could be used for search and rescue mission, however, it has been noted that currently available batteries, solar cells and piezoelectrics that harvest energy from movement cannot provide enough power to run the electrodes and radio transmitters for very long. =Drosophila= Work using Drosophila has dispensed with stimulating electrodes and developed a 3-part remote control system that evokes action potentials in pre-specified Drosophila neurons using a laser beam. The central component of the remote control system is a Ligand-gated ion channel gated by ATP. When ATP is applied, uptake of external calcium is induced and action potentials generated. The remaining two parts of the remote control system include chemically caged ATP, which is injected into the central nervous system through the fly's simple eye, and laser light capable of uncaging the injected ATP. The giant fibre system in insects consists of a pair of large interneurons in the brain which can excite the insect flight and jump muscles. A 200 ms pulse of laser light elicited jumping, wing flapping, or other flight movements in 60%‚Äì80% of the flies. Although this frequency is lower than that observed with direct electrical stimulation of the giant fibre system, it is higher than that elicited by natural stimuli, such as a light-off stimulus. Fish =Sharks= Spiny dogfish sharks have been remotely controlled by implanting electrodes deep in the shark's brain to a remote control device outside the tank. When an electric current is passed through the wire, it stimulates the shark's sense of smell and the animal turns, just as it would move toward blood in the ocean. Stronger electrical signals‚Äîmimicking stronger smells‚Äîcause the shark to turn more sharply. One study is funded by a $600,000 grant from Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). It has been suggested that such sharks could search hostile waters with sensors that detect explosives, or cameras that record intelligence photographs. Outside the military, similar sensors could detect oil spills or gather data on the behaviour of sharks in their natural habitat. Scientists working with remote control sharks admit they are not sure exactly which neurons they are stimulating, and therefore, they can't always control the shark's direction reliably. The sharks only respond after some training, and some sharks don't respond at all. The research has prompted protests from bloggers who allude to remote controlled humans or horror films featuring maniacal cyborg sharks on a feeding frenzy. An alternative technique was to use small gadgets attached to the shark's noses that released squid juice on demand. Reptiles =Turtles= Video of a remote controlled turtle South Korean researchers have remotely controlled the movements of a turtle using a completely non- invasive steering system. Red-eared terrapins (Trachemys scripta elegans) were made to follow a specific path by manipulating the turtles' natural obstacle avoidance behaviour. If these turtles detect something is blocking their path in one direction, they move to avoid it. The researchers attached a black half cylinder to the turtle. The \\"visor\\" was positioned around the turtle's rear end, but was pivoted around using a microcontroller and a servo motor to either the left or right to partially block the turtle's vision on one side. This made the turtle believe there was an obstacle it needed to avoid on that side and thereby encouraged the turtle to move in the other direction. =Geckos= Some animals have had parts of their bodies remotely controlled, rather than their entire bodies. Researchers in China stimulated the mesencephalon of geckos (G. gecko) via micro stainless steel electrodes and observed the gecko's responses during stimulation. Locomotion responses such as spinal bending and limb movements could be elicited in different depths of mesencephalon. Stimulation of the periaqueductal gray area elicited ipsilateral spinal bending while stimulation of the ventral tegmental area elicited contralateral spinal bending. Birds =Pigeons= In 2007, researchers at east China's Shandong University of Science and Technology implanted micro electrodes in the brain of a pigeon so they could remotely control it to fly right or left, or up or down. Uses and justification Remote-controlled animals are considered to have several potential uses, replacing the need for humans in some dangerous situations. Their application is further widened if they are equipped with additional electronic devices. Small creatures fitted with cameras and other sensors have been proposed as being useful when searching for survivors after a building has collapsed, with cockroaches or rats being small and manoeuvrable enough to go under rubble. There have been a number of suggested military uses of remote controlled animals, particularly in the area of surveillance. Remote-controlled dogfish sharks have been likened to the studies into the use of military dolphins. It has also been proposed that remote-controlled rats could be used for the clearing of land mines. Other suggested fields of application include pest control, the mapping of underground areas, and the study of animal behaviour. Development of robots that are capable of performing the same actions as controlled animals is often technologically difficult and cost-prohibitive. Flight is very difficult to replicate while having an acceptable payload and flight duration. Harnessing insects and using their natural flying ability gives significant improvements in performance. The availability of \\"inexpensive, organic substitutes\\" therefore allows for the development of small, controllable robots that are otherwise currently unavailable. Similar applications Some animals are remotely controlled, but rather than being directed to move left or right, the animal is prevented from moving forward, or its behaviour is modified in other ways. =Shock collars= A dog wearing a shock collar Shock collars deliver electrical shocks of varying intensity and duration to the neck or other area of a dog's body via a radio-controlled electronic device incorporated into a dog collar. Some collar models also include a tone or vibration setting, as an alternative to or in conjunction with the shock. Shock collars are now readily available and have been used in a range of applications, including behavioural modification, obedience training, and pet containment, as well as in military, police and service training. While similar systems are available for other animals, the most common are the collars designed for domestic dogs. The use of shock collars is controversial and scientific evidence for their safety and efficacy is mixed. A few countries have enacted bans or controls on their use. Some animal welfare organizations warn against their use or actively support a ban on their use or sale. Some want restrictions placed on their sale. Some professional dog trainers and their organizations oppose their use and some support them. Support for their use or calls for bans from the general public is mixed. =Invisible fences= In 2007, it was reported that scientists at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation had developed a prototype \\"invisible fence\\" using the Global Positioning System (GPS) in a project nicknamed Bovines Without Borders. The system uses battery-powered collars that emit a sound to warn cattle when they are approaching a virtual boundary. If a cow wanders too near, the collar emits a warning noise. If it continues, the cow gets an electric shock of 250-milliwatts . The boundaries are drawn by GPS and exist only as a line on a computer. There are no wires or fixed transmitters at all. The cattle took less than an hour to learn to back off when they heard the warning noise. The scientists indicated that commercial units were up to 10 years away. Another type of invisible fence uses a buried wire that sends radio signals to activate shock collars worn by animals that are \\"fenced\\" in. The system works with three signals. The first is visual (white plastic flags spaced at intervals around the perimeter in the fenced-in area), the second is audible (the collar emits a sound when the animal wearing it approaches buried cable), and finally there's an electric shock to indicate they have reached the fence. Other invisible fences are wireless. Rather than using a buried wire, they emit a radio signal from a central unit, and activate when the animal travels beyond a certain radius from the unit.

Biography Gianteresio Vattimo was born in Turin, Piedmont. He studied philosophy under the existentialist Luigi Pareyson at the University of Turin, and graduated with a laurea in 1959. After studying with Karl L√∂with and Hans-Georg Gadamer in Heidelberg he returned to Turin where he became assistant professor in 1964, and later full professor of Aesthetics in 1969. While remaining at Turin, becoming Professor of Theoretical Philosophy in 1982, he has been a visiting professor at a number of American Universities. For his works, he received honorary degrees from the universities of La Plata, Palermo, Madrid, Havana, San Marcos of Lima. Vattimo says he was exempted from military service.Well-known Italian philosopher:'I‚Äôd like to shoot those bastard Zionists' After being active in the Radical Party, the short-lived Alleanza per Torino, and the Democrats of the Left, Vattimo joined the Party of Italian Communists. He was elected a member of the European Parliament first in 1999 and for a second mandate in 2009. He is openly gay and a nihilist who has embraced Nietzsche's idea of God's death. Philosophy Vattimo's philosophy can be characterized as postmodern with his emphasis on \\"pensiero debole\\" (weak thought). This requires that the foundational certainties of modernity with its emphasis on objective truth founded in a rational unitary subject be relinquished for a more multi-faceted conception closer to that of the arts. He draws on the philosophy of Martin Heidegger with his critique of foundations and the hermeneutic philosophy of his teacher Hans-Georg Gadamer. Perhaps his greatest influence though is the thought of Friedrich Nietzsche, whose \\"discovery of the 'lie', the discovery that alleged 'values' and metaphysical structures are just a play of forces\\" (1993:93), plays an important role in Vattimo's notion of \\"weak thought.\\" Vattimo rejects any notion of a transcendental structure of reason or reality that would be given once and for all. This does not imply the loss of truth, but a Heideggerean reinterpretation of truth as the opening of horizons. Such truth is deeper than propositions which are made possible by such openings. Philosophies then are always responses to contingent questions, they are 'ontologies of actuality,' a thesis that can be confirmed by the historico- cultural links of particular philosophies. For hermeneutics to be consistent with its own rejection of metaphysics, it must present itself, argues Vattimo \\"as the most persuasive philosophical interpretation of a situation or 'epoch'\\" (1997:10). To do this, Vattimo proposes a reading of hermeneutics as having a \\"nihilistic\\" vocation.Matthias Riedl. in Discoursing the Post- Secular: Essays on the Habermasian Post-Secular Turn. Edited by P√©ter Losonczi and Aakash Singh. LIT: M√ºnster 2010, pp. 111-126. To Vattimo, hermeneutics has become boring and vague, lacking any clear significance for philosophical problems. His answer is to insist on the nihilistic consequences of hermeneutics. The claim that \\"there are no facts only interpretations and this too is an interpretation\\" amounts to saying that hermeneutics cannot be seen as the most accurate/true description of the permanent structures of reality of human existence. Hermeneutics is not a metaphysical theory in this sense and so can only be \\"proved\\" by being presented as the response to a history of being, a history of the fabling of the world, of the weakening of structures, that is as the occurrence of nihilism. This nihilistic reading of history involves a certain attitude towards modernity, whereby modernity is dissolved from within through a twisting, distorting radicalisation of its premises. Vattimo uses Heidegger's term Verwindung to capture this post-modern recovery from modernity. History as a process of weakening (secularisation and disenchantment are other terms Vattimo uses) \\"assumes the form of a decision for non-violence\\" (1992:95). An ethics of communication along the lines suggested by J√ºrgen Habermas suffers, according to Vattimo, from finding itself in a substantially ahistorical position, while oscillating between formalism and cultural relativism (1992:117). For Vattimo it is only when hermeneutics accepts its nihilistic destiny that \\"it can find in 'negativity,' in dissolution as the 'destiny of Being' ... the orientating principle that enables it to realize its own original inclination for ethics whilst neither restoring metaphysics nor surrendering to the futility of a relativistic philosophy of culture\\" (1992:119). In 2004, after leaving the party of the Democrats of the Left, he endorsed Marxism, reassessing positively its projectual principles and wishing for a \\"return\\" to the thought of the Trier philosopher and to a communism, rid of distorted soviet developments, which have to be dialectically overcome. Vattimo asserts the continuity of his new choices with the \\"weak thought,\\" thus having changed \\"many of his ideas.\\" He namely refers to a \\"weakened Marx,\\"Gianni Vattimo. Ecce comu. Come si ri- diventa ci√≤ che si era. Fazi. Rome, 2007 as ideological basis capable of showing the real nature of communism. The new Marxist approach, therefore, emerges as a practical development of the \\"weak thought\\" into the frame of a political perspective. His next political book, co-authored with Santiago Zabala, is Hermeneutic Communism: From Heidegger to Marx (2011). The authors explain the book Hermeneutic Communism as follows: \\"Although the material published here has never been released before, there are two books that have determined the production of this text: Gianni's Ecce Comu: Come si diventa cio che si era (2007) and Santiago's The Remains of Being: Hermeneutic Ontology After Metaphysics (2009). In the former, Vattimo emphasized the political necessity of reevaluating communism; in the latter, Zabala insisted on the progressive nature of hermeneutics. Hermeneutic Communism can be considered a radical development of both.\\"Gianni Vattimo and Santiago Zabala. Hermeneutic Communism: From Heidegger to Marx Columbia University Press. 2011. Pg. VII Views and opinions =Support for Hamas= Vattimo added his name to a petition released on February 28, 2009, calling on the European Union to remove Hamas from its list of terrorist organizations and grant it full recognition as a legitimate voice of the Palestinian people. On July 22, 2014, in response to the IDF military operation in Gaza against Hamas attacks on Israel, Vattimo said he would personally like to \\"shoot those bastard Zionists\\" and thinks Europeans should raise money \\"to buy Hamas some more rockets.\\" He expressed his willingness to go to Gaza and fight side by side with Hamas and asserted, when asked if he would shoot at Israelis, that: 'By nature I'm non-violent, but I'd shoot at those (of them) who bomb hospitals, private clinics and children.' Vattimo added that for him these were 'pure Nazis', the state itself a Nazi state (uno stato nazista) perhaps somewhat worse even than Hitler because in Israel's case, they have the support of the great Western democracies.Gisella Ruccia, 'Israele? Nazisti puri, forse peggio di Hitler,' Il Fatto Quotidiano 16 July 2014. =Antisemitism= Vattimo has been accused of antisemitism. Renzo Gattegna, the president of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities, accused him of antisemitism, writing \\"words of hatred that don't add anything new and are accompanied by the squalid reproposal of anti-Semitic stereotypes\\". Rabbi Barbara Aiello, Italy's first female rabbi, accused Vattimo of antisemitism. Reacting to his statements and to others like it, the foreign ministers for Italy, France and Germany said that they condemn anti-Semitic slurs as well as violence that has occurred at pro-Palestinian demonstrations in Europe. Pronounced in a moment of indignation against the prolonged bombing of Gaza by the Israeli army, Vattimo apologized to an Israeli newspaper (Haaretz). \\"In a telephone interview [...], Gianni Vattimo said he ‚Äúregrets‚Äù such words and ‚Äúfeels ashamed‚Äù by them\\", claiming he was \\"provoked\\" by the hosts of the show on which he made his comments., sur \\"\\".

He was extradited to the United States, and was convicted of explosives and weapons charges after pleading guilty. Reumayr's plan involved purchasing significant quantities of oil futures prior to the bombing in the hope that the damaged pipeline would reduce oil supplies and drive up the price of oil, leaving him to rake in the profits. However, no evidence ever existed that he even had a futures account. However, Reumayr was never able to implement his plan. In an effort to obtain blasting caps, Reumayr contacted an acquaintance whom he had met several years earlier while serving a 5-year prison sentence for fraud. This acquaintance, James Paxton, subsequently contacted the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and agreed to work as informant in this case. The two people communicated over email and Reumayr sent Paxton approximately $3000 USD intended for the purchase of explosive ingredients. Eventually, Reumayr and Paxton met at a hotel room in Surrey, British Columbia to discuss technical details of the plan. Unbeknownst to Reumayr, the hotel room had been bugged by Canadian police, which led to his arrest. Reumayr was charged with six counts of explosive-related and terrorism offenses in New Mexico, though the scheme was allegedly going to be carried out in Alaska. An assessment made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded that Reumayr's planned attack \\"could have interrupted oil flow through the pipeline for as many as 90 days\\" and resulted in oil and gas shortages in California and several other western states. Reumayr's lawyer argued, however, that the terrorism charges were unwarranted, and that the plan was \\"aimed at making money ... and not hurt anybody.\\" After a 7-year extradition battle, and a failed appeal to the Supreme Court, Reumayr was deported to the United States in 2006. In 2008, Reumayr plead guilty to explosives and weapon charges, after admitting to providing the informant, James Paxton, with explosive materials. He was sentenced by district judge Bruce D. Black of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico to 13 years in federal prison, with 9 years' credit for time served. He was released on December 15, 2010.

Walmart Chairman Rob Walton, added that \\"I particularly respect the special relationship that he has built with our associates in the field. This says a lot about how well Tom Coughlin represents the Walmart culture\\". Legal troubles In March 2005, Walmart announced that Coughlin had resigned from the board of directors as a result of an internal investigation. The investigation alleged that the use of corporate-owned gift cards and personal reimbursements estimated to be in the range of $100,000 to $500,000.Details, sec.gov; accessed April 2, 2016. Beginning in July 2005, he was the subject of a United States Department of Justice investigation, as well as a lawsuit by Walmart, and was reviewed by a federal grand jury over misuse of company gift cards. When the charges first surfaced in April 2005, Coughlin claimed the money he embezzled was being used to pay bribes to trade union officials not to organize at Walmart locations and to identify pro-union Walmart workers. He pleaded guilty to five counts of wire fraud and one count of filing a false tax return related to embezzlement and theft from Walmart while serving as a member of its board. U.S. Attorney Robert Balfe told reporters the investigation had found no evidence backing Coughlin's earlier claims that the money he took was reimbursement for anti-union activities.

It is probably the best-known call in square dancing aside from, perhaps, \\"Promenade\\". Description It is a circular movement where two people, who are initially facing each other, walk around each other without or almost without turning, i.e., facing in the same direction (same wall) all the time. In most cases it takes 6‚Äì8 counts to complete. The movement is basically defined by as follows: * dancers advance and pass right shoulders, * without turning each dancer moves to the right passing in back of the other dancer. At this moment the partners face away from each other, * then moving backwards dancers pass left shoulders returning to starting position. The actual steps vary in specific dances. Considering the amount of space in which to accomplish the figure, the partners might adjust their shoulders slightly diagonally to allow for less sideways movement during the shoulder passes. The advancing pass may also be by the left shoulders, although it will be called as a \\"left do-si-do\\" or a \\"see-saw\\". While executing this move, the girls may move their skirts with their hands from side to side (skirtwork), flaring it to the right as right shoulders pass, and to the left as left shoulders pass. Men may decide to place their arms on top of each other, in a style very similar to Russian folk dancing. Spelling usage by different dances The term is a corruption of the original French term dos-√†-dos for the dance move, which means \\"back to back\\", as opposed to \\"vis-√†-vis\\" which means \\"face to face\\".Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. \\"do-se- do, n.\\", \\"vis-√†-vis, n., prep., and adv.\\". Do-si-do is the most common spelling in modern English dictionariesSee, for example, Merriam-Webster's, Oxford Dictionaries, Longman Dictionary, American Heritage Dictionary and is the spelling used in contra dance, sometimes without hyphens.Contra Dance and Song Society, \\"Contra Dance Repertoire\\" A related variant is do-se-do. In modern western square dancing, the usual spelling is Dosado which is the closest to the original french form as it‚Äôs pronounced in French [Dozado](used by Callerlab, the largest international association of square dance callers)See, for example, CALLERLAB, \\"Abbreviated Definitions Basic/Mainstream\\", in \\"Dance Program Documents\\", 2013. or DoSaDo (used by the American Callers Association).American Callers Association, \\"ACA New One Floor List , p. 1. Dos-a-dos is still in current use in some dances. In English country dance and other British dance forms, it is known as the \\"back to back\\". Styling Styling traditions, or the addition of flourishes to a basic step, tend to be local, and not all dancers like to do styling, but nevertheless a common styling done to the dosado is the \\"Hungarian Swing\\" or \\"Highland Fling\\" styling. This addition to the basic step is accomplished as follows: * The two people, who are initially facing each other, step forward as if they will pass each other by the right shoulder (as in a normal Dosado), but they stop momentarily when they are right hip-to-right hip * They stretch right arms across each other and place right hands on each other's waist, simultaneously they lift left arms up with left hands above their own heads, in what is perceived as a \\"Highland Fling\\" position * They pivot around 360¬∞ together, rotating on the balls of their inner feet * They release hand holds and lower arms into a neutral stance, and adjust slightly backwards so they are facing each other Even with styling the move should take no longer to execute than a normal Dosado. In contra dance it is common for experienced dancers to embellish the move by making one or more counterclockwise turns as they go around the other dancer. Dosado variations The Dosado can also be fractionalized‚Äî Dosado results in the active dancers standing side-by-side right hip-to-right hip, Dosado results in the active dancers standing back-to- back, and Dosado results in the active dancers standing side-by-side left hip- to-left hip. When standing side-to-side the dancers join adjacent hands palm- to-palm to make a mini-wave (in the case of two people), an ocean wave (in the case of three-six people), or a tidal wave (in the case of eight people). A Dosado would be a full (or normal) Dosado and an additional Dosado, resulting in the dancers standing back-to-back. Dosado variants are often considered entertaining \\"gimmicks\\".

Nashrullah Khan during his father's reign having a tooth extracted in front of the soldiers of his father's army  Visit to England  Prince Nasrullah meets Queen Victoria during his 1895 visit to England. In 1895 the Emir Abdur Rahman Khan had intended to undertake a state visit to England to pay his respects to the ageing Queen Victoria. However, his health prevented him from making the trip, and so he instead sent his son the Shahzada Nasrullah Khan. Nasrullah departed Bombay on April 29, 1895, with an entourage of over 90 dignitaries, including \\"five or six\\" high-ranking Afghan nobles and a group of priests for the observance of religious functions. On May 23 the Shahzada landed at Portsmouth in England. On 27 May 1895 the Shahzada was received by the Queen at Windsor. During his trip he also visited the Liverpool Overhead Railway, and went to Ascot, Glasgow, and the Elswick Company Gun Range at Blitterlees Banks, as well as staying with Lord Armstrong at Cragside.The Times, June 17, 1895 He made a gift of ¬£2,500 to Abdullah Quilliam to support the work of the Liverpool Muslim Institute. At the time of his visit, the Shahzada was 20 years of age. He reportedly did not speak English well, and did not make a good impression on the local press. A reporter from the Cumberland Pacquet described him as \\"a stolid, impassive, and greatly bored youth\\". On 3 September 1895 he left England for Paris, and from Paris went on to Rome and Naples, and arrived in Karachi on October 16, 1895. He returned to Kabul through Quetta, Chaman and Kandahar. The National Geographic Magazine believed this to be the longest journey ever undertaken by an Afghan.National Geographic Magazine 1921, Volume 39, p 97 In 1895, Nasrullah and his brother Habibullah received the Knight Grand Cross of St Michael and St George from Queen Victoria in recognition of their services to the British Commonwealth. During Habibullah's reign On 3 October 1901 Nasrullah's father Abdur Rahman died, aged 57, and Nasrullah's brother Habibullah peacefully ascended the throne of Afghanistan by right of primogeniture. Prior to his death, Abdur Rahman had sought to totally subdue any sources of opposition to his reign and the stability of Afghanistan with strict laws and restrictions. Among those affected by Abdur Rahman's restrictions was the religious establishment. Upon Abdur Rahman's death, the religious establishment sought to regain its power, and saw in Nasrullah a potential ally. Nasrullah was by this stage deeply religious and had qualified as a Hafiz, or \\"Memorizer of the Qur'an\\", one who has memorised entire Quran. Throughout his adult life he advocated an Afghan policy strongly aligned with Islamic principles. Recognising his brother as a potential contender for the throne, Habibullah went to lengths to placate and gain the support of Nasrullah. Upon Habibullah's succession to the throne he named Nasrullah commander-in-chief of the Afghan army, and also gave him the title of President of the State Council. Later in his reign, Habibullah named Nasrullah his heir to the throne in preference to Habibullah's own sons. By contrast, Nasrullah's younger brother Mohammed Omar Jar, and Mohammed's mother the Queen Dowager Bibi Hallima, both of whom were powerful political forces potentially of danger to Habibullah, were kept by Habibullah as \\"practically state prisoners\\" confined in private quarters under the guise of protection by a strong detachment of the Imperial Bodyguard (Mohammed Omar Jar having been stripped of his own personal bodyguard ‚Äì and state positions ‚Äì by Habibullah in 1904). The level of influence Nasrullah enjoyed led Angus Hamilton in his 1910 book Afghanistan to describe Habibullah as a \\"weak-willed\\" ruler, and the possibility of Nasrullah making an attempt on the throne caused Hamilton to describe him as a \\"stormy petrel in the Afghan sea of domestic politics\\". Anti-British policy Despite his earlier trip to England, Nasrullah demonstrated little sympathy for British foreign policy towards Afghanistan. When Abdul Rahman Khan took the throne of Afghanistan in 1880, he inherited the terms of the 1878 Treaty of Gandamak, which made Afghanistan a British protectorate. The treaty, amongst other provisions, surrendered control over Afghan foreign relations to the British and allowed for a British mission, with European members, to reside in Kabul. Abdul Rahman Khan was able to alter the terms of the treaty to provide that all members of the British mission be Indian Muslims but was otherwise stuck with the treaty in its entirety. The Treaty of Gandamak also required that Afghanistan sever its relationships with the independent tribes of the tribal regions of Afghanistan, those lying on the far side of the Durand Line. These tribes had previously been a substantial source of military power for the Afghanistan throne. When Habibullah became Emir he was pressured by the British government to ratify the Treaty of Gandamak and, although he did so by proclamation in 1905, he would not commit to withdraw Afghan influence from the British side of the Durand Line, or to sever Afghanistan's relationship with the tribes in that area. The significance of the tribal areas was that they formed a natural military barrier against the British, who periodically threatened to invade the region to counter Russian advances from the north. Nasrullah Khan actively agitated his brother Habibullah to make use of Afghanistan's influence with the tribes to strengthen Afghanistan's position against the British, and at Nasrullah's urging Habibullah continue to pay allowances to the Durand Line tribes despite the Treaty of Gandamak. At around the same time, during 1904‚Äì05, Sir Louis Dane (later governor of the Punjab region of India) attempted to establish a new British mission at Kabul in line with the terms of the Treaty. This was a plan which Nasrullah unsuccessfully opposed. When the First World War broke out in 1914, the Young Afghan political movement, headed by journalist Mahmud Tarzi and Habibullah's son Amanullah, advocated that Afghanistan enter the war on the German-Turkish side, in direct opposition to Britain. In this they had the support of Nasrullah and the religious factions he represented, who were sympathetic towards the Ottomans because of what they saw as unwarranted infidel aggression towards Islamic states. Despite this, the Emir Habibullah Khan judged Afghanistan too poor and weak to realistically take part in the war, and declared Afghanistan's neutrality, to the frustration of Nasrullah and the Young Afghans. Nevertheless, Nasrullah actively used his political power to assist the German-Turkish efforts. When the Turko-German Niedermayer-Hentig expedition was welcomed to Kabul in 1915 (despite promises to the Viceroy of India that the expedition would be arrested), Nasrullah provided a friendly ear to the mission after Habibullah reaffirmed Afghanistan's neutrality. Nasrullah was involved in introducing the expedition to journalist Mahmud Tarzi, whose papers began taking an increasingly anti-British stance. He also continued to entreat the mission to remain in Kabul despite Habibullah's unwillingness to offer them a solid alliance. Finally in 1916 Nasrullah offered to remove Habibullah from power and take charge of the frontier tribes in a campaign against British India, but by then the mission realised such action would be fruitless and declined.Hughes, Thomas L (2002), The German Mission to Afghanistan, 1915‚Äì1916.German Studies Review, Vol. 25, No. 3. (Oct., 2002), pp. 447‚Äì476., German Studies Association, The Turko-German embassy withdrew in 1916, but not before it had convinced Habibullah that Afghanistan was an independent nation which should not remain beholden to the British. Following the closure of the World War, Habibullah petitioned the British for favours resulting from Afghanistan's alleged assistance to the British during the war. These favours included the recognition of Afghanistan's independence and a seat at the Versailles Peace Conference. Britain refused both these requests. Habibullah sought to open further negotiations but before these could progress he was assassinated.  Succession and death  In February 1919, Emir Habibullah Khan went on a hunting trip to Afghanistan's Laghman Province. Among those in his retinue were Nasrullah Khan, Habibullah's first son Inayatullah, and Habibullah's commander-in-chief Nadir Khan. On the evening of February 20, 1919, Habibullah was assassinated while in his tent by Shuja ud- Dawla, one of the pages who slept in his tent, on orders from his younger son, Amanullah, leaving Nasrullah the heir successor to the Afghan throne. Nasrullah at first refused to take the throne and declared his allegiance to Inayatullah, Habibullah's first born. Inayatullah refused and said that his father had made Nasrullah the heir rightfully and wanted him to become Emir. All the local tribes people also gave their allegiance to Nasrullah, who was a pious and religious man. The remainder of Habibullah's party journeyed south- east to Jalalabad, and on February 21, 1919 reached that city, whereupon Nasrullah was declared Emir, supported by Habibullah's first son Inayatullah.Afghanistan 1919‚Äì1928: Sources in the India Office Records Upon receiving the news, Amanullah Khan, third son of Habibullah by Habibullah's first wife, had remained in Kabul as the king's representative. Using this opportunity, he immediately seized control of the treasury at Kabul and staged a coup against his uncle.The Butcher of Amritsar ‚Äì General Reginal Dyer Nigel Collett, 2006 He took control of Kabul and the central government, declaring war against Nasrullah. Nasrullah did not want any blood shed in order for him to be king. He told Amanullah that he can have the kingdom, and he will take exile in Saudi Arabia. Amanullah Khan swore upon the Quran that no harm would come to Nasrullah if he returned to Kabul and then he can do as he pleased. Fearing that Nasrullah's supporters would rise against Amanullah, he went against his word and imprisoned Nasrullah and his supporters. On February 28, 1919, Amanullah proclaimed himself Emir, and on March 3, 1919 Nasrullah was arrested by Amanullah's forces. On April 13, 1919, Amanullah held a Durbar (a royal court under the supervision of Amanullah) in Kabul which inquired into the death of Habibullah. It found a colonel in the Afghanistan military guilty of the crime, and had him executed. On manufactured evidence, it found Nasrullah complicit in the assassination. He imprisoned Nasrullah to life imprisonment,The State, Religion and Ethnic Politics: Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan Ali Banuazizi, 1988 and had him assassinated approximately one year later while in the royal jail.

During his football career, he played for Blackburn Rovers and Crewe Alexandra. Whelan is the former owner of Football League Championship club Wigan Athletic, having also been the chairman of the club for twenty years, before passing the position over to his grandson, David Sharpe, who eventually passed the ownership over to International Entertainment Corporation. He is also owner of the DW Stadium, home to Football League Championship Football club Wigan Athletic and Rugby League club Wigan Warriors. Early life Whelan was born in Bradford, and raised in Wigan. His forebears hailed from County Tipperary, Ireland. Football career Whelan was a member of Blackburn Rovers' 1960 FA Cup Final team, which lost 3‚Äì0 to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Whelan himself did not complete the game, a feisty challenge from Whelan on Norman Deeley culminated in the Blackburn man being withdrawn before half time due to a broken leg. Whelan's injury is one of many serious injuries suffered by players in the 1950‚Äì60 era and was known as the Wembley hoodoo.Wembley Hoodoo The Guardian Following his leg break, Whelan was sold to Crewe Alexandra F.C. where he played for several years before retiring to concentrate fully on his chain of supermarkets, Whelan's Discount Stores, which were sold to Ken Morrison for over a million pounds. Ownerships =Whelan Discount Stores= Whelan started out a market stall on Wigan market after working with Howarth Brothers on their stall in Blackburn. He later progressed into a grocers, before visiting America where he studied the self- service supermarket. He returned to England and set about creating a supermarket chain. By the late 1960s the business had 10 stores based across Lancashire. In 1978 Whelan sold the business to Morrisons for ¬£1.5 million. =JJB Sports= Whelan acquired Wigan fishing and sports store JJ Bradburns in 1971. He renamed the company JJB Sports (even though JJB are the initials of previous owner John Jarvis Broughton) and soon focused purely on sports goods. By 1980, JJB had seven stores, and continued to expand throughout the 80s and 90s, to become the UK's second biggest sports retailer. In 2005, JJB Sports was fined ¬£5.5 million by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) for fixing the price of the English National Team and Manchester United shirts in 2000 and 2001. Which? (the Consumers' Association) issued proceedings against JJB, suing for damages on behalf of consumers affected by the price fixing. Whelan gradually scaled down his interests in the company, and in 2005 stepped down as chairman. However, in October 2006, he personally intervened to overturn the settlement of a pay dispute at JJB's Wigan warehouse negotiated by new chairman Tom Knight, branding it \\"the equivalent of Communism\\", prompting a two-day strike. In January 2007 he sold ¬£50m worth of shares in JJB, before selling his remaining 29% stake in June 2007. This action was in breach of an agreement Whelan had with the stock exchange on 26 January 2007, whereby he undertook to make no further disposals for the following 12 months. =DW Sports Fitness= In March 2009, Whelan acquired back troubled JJB's nationwide chain of fitness clubs and stores. Wigan Athletic's stadium became the DW Stadium and their new sponsor, DW Sports Fitness, taking the initials of its owner and his new company. =Wigan Athletic F.C.= Whelan funded the DW Stadium, home of Wigan Athletic and Wigan Warriors Whelan bought Wigan Athletic in February 1995, when they were a Division Three team. After Whelan took the reins he announced that he would get Wigan Athletic into the Premier League, a promise he fulfilled in 2005. This began with the Division Three title in 1996‚Äì97, the Division Two title in 2002‚Äì03 and promotion to the Premiership as Championship runners-up in 2004‚Äì05. He funded the ¬£30 million construction of the club's new JJB Stadium (now the DW Stadium) which opened in 1999 and on its completion was one of the largest football stadiums outside the Premier League. Wigan, who were tipped to be relegated from the Premier League in their first season, not only managed to stay up (and remained in the top flight for eight years), but claimed a 10th place league position and also reached the final of the Football League Cup. In 2005, Whelan threatened to quit the club unless the price of policing games was reduced. In 2007, he called for the relegation of West Ham United as punishment for their incorrect registration of Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano. He subsequently called for Premier League Chairman Dave Richards and chief executive Richard Scudamore to resign. An arbitration committee met to consider the affair. It ruled in favour of the Premier League. Wigan managed an end-of-season victory at Sheffield United, a 2‚Äì1 win with the goals being scored by Paul Scharner in the 14th minute and a penalty from David Unsworth in injury time of the first half, after Jon Stead had equalised for Sheffield United in the 38th minute. It was a dramatic final-day Premiership survival story, with the result saving Wigan and condemning Sheffield United to the Championship. On 11 May 2013, in a dramatic ending to the FA Cup Final against Manchester City, Ben Watson scored a header in the 91st minute to win the game 1‚Äì0. This was Wigan's first major trophy in their Premier League history and gave Whelan the chance to hold the FA Cup trophy, 53 years after breaking his leg as a 1960 finalist. Three days later, a defeat to Arsenal saw Wigan relegated to the Championship, ending a spell of eight years in the Premier League. On 3 March 2015, Whelan stepped down as chairman, appointing his 23-year-old grandson, David Sharpe, as the new chairman. =Wigan Warriors= After the announcement of Maurice Lindsay's intention to retire immediately from the club after the Warriors' loss at the hands of Catalans Dragons on 29 July 2007, Whelan managed to persuade him to stay on until the end of the season. After the announcement of Lindsay's retirement however, Whelan said he would be willing to sell the club after a proposed takeover from a \\"genuine Wigan fan\\" earlier in the year. On 24 October 2007, it was announced that Ian Lenagan, former owner of Harlequins RL, had completed his takeover of Wigan Warriors, buying out Whelan's 89% stake in the club with the deal taking effect from 1 December 2007. =Orrell Rugby Union Club= Wigan Warriors Rugby League Club Chairman Maurice Lindsay and business tycoon Dave Whelan, the then owner of the JJB Sports empire, had already been making noises about forming a rugby union side. Initial contact was made via Whelan's Finance Director Simon Moorehead and an exciting night saw the members promised ¬£10,000,000 investment over 5 years, with Mr Whelan expressing the dream to be drinking red wine away to Toulouse in the European Cup in the not-too-distant future. Wide-eyed, and with these promises of future success, the members reluctantly sold their shares in the club for ¬£1,000 each, to the new owners, with Lindsay becoming the club's new Chairman. Politics A supporter of the Conservative Party, Whelan has donated in total ¬£1.5 million to the party since 2007, with his most recent donation of ¬£100,000 made in August 2014.\\"Dave Whelan controversy: Wigan chairman threatens to resign if he's punished by FA\\" by Rory Dolland, Manchester Evening News, 22 November 2014 He said David Cameron had his full support.\\"Wigan tycoon gives ¬£1m to Tories\\", BBC News, 27 September 2007 In 2013, he called for a mandatory minute's silence at all football games to mark the death of Margaret Thatcher. The F.A. rejected the proposal. Controversies In November 2014, Whelan was accused of making antisemitic statements, following an interview he gave The Guardian, defending his decision to hire Malky Mackay as manager of Wigan. Mackay was under investigation by the FA for alleged racism and antisemitism in e-mails and text messages he sent while manager of Cardiff City. During the interview, Whelan was quoted as saying \\"Jewish people chase money more than everybody else.\\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/20/wigan-dave-whelan- accused-antisemitism-jewish-people The statements were condemned by West Ham United co-chairman David Gold and former FA and Premier League executive Simon Johnson, both of whom are Jewish.Dave Whelan: Wigan owner accused of anti- Semitism Whelan was also accused of racist attitudes by defending Mackay's alleged referral to Chinese people as \\"chinks\\". Cardiff City owner, Vincent Tan, who is Malaysian Chinese, said of Whelan, \\"I think he has insulted the dignity of the Chinese\\". Whelan later apologised for his remarks. Anti-racist organisation Kick It Out offered support to Whelan, saying that they had a responsibility to ensure that people of his age would understand \\"modern expectations\\". Whelan threatened to leave his position at Wigan if the FA found him guilty of racism. At the first match since the controversy, on 22 November against Middlesbrough, he was applauded by Wigan fans as he took his seat in the DW Stadium. On 27 November, the FA charged Whelan with an aggravated breach of FA Rule E3 [2], as his comments had included \\"a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or nationality and/or religion or belief\\". He was given a six-week ban and fined ¬£50,000 on 31 December, although the FA investigation concluded that he was neither a racist nor had intended to cause offence. In March the following year, Whelan resigned his position as Wigan chairman, naming as replacement his grandson, David Sharpe, with the Whelan family remaining as majority shareholders.

Modarelli simplified the seal, leaving only the white stars and orbital path on a round field of blue with a red vector. He then added white N-A-S-A lettering. =NASA \\"worm\\" logotype= In 1974, as part of the Federal Graphics Improvement Program of the National Endowment for the Arts, NASA hired Richard Danne and Bruce Blackburn to design a more modern logo. In 1975, the agency switched to the modernist NASA logotype, nicknamed \\"the worm\\", a red, stylized rendering of the letters N-A-S-A. The horizontal bars on the A's are removed in the worm logo. =Retirement and return of the 'worm'= The NASA logotype was retired from official use on May 22, 1992 by NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin. The design was used only for special occasions and commercial merchandising purposes approved by the Visual Identity Coordinator at NASA Headquarters until 2020, when it was brought out of retirement by administrator Jim Bridenstine. The re-instated logo was unveiled on the booster for SpaceX's Crew-Demo 2 Mission. This marked its first official use since 1992. the logo, with blue lettering instead of red, is also used by the NASA Federal Credit Union. Usage Space Shuttle Endeavour, 2007 The official NASA seal is reserved for use in connection with the NASA Administrator. It is used in more formal traditional and ceremonial events such as award presentations and press conferences. According to NASA Headquarters, the seal should never be used with the NASA insignia, since the two elements are intended for different purposes and are visually incompatible when seen side by side. Like most images produced by the United States Government, the insignia, the \\"worm\\" logo and the NASA seal are in the public domain. However, their usage is restricted under Code of Federal Regulations 14 CFR 1221. These NASA emblems should be reproduced only from original reproduction proofs, transparencies, or computer files available from NASA Headquarters.

It is located at 555 MacKenzie Avenue, just south of the American Embassy. To the east, the building looks out on the Byward Market, and to the west is MacKenzie Avenue and Major's Hill Park. Today, it houses a portion of Headquarters operations for the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). The Minister and Commissioner of the CRA have offices in the building. History By the early 20th century, the Parliament Buildings were running out of space to house Canada's civil service and offices of the legislative branch of the government. The Tudor-Gothic structure was designed by chief architect David Ewart, who also did the similarly modified Norman style architecture of the Victoria Memorial Building of the Canadian Museum of Nature and the Royal Canadian Mint. Work began on the building in 1913, but the First World War and other problems intervened, greatly slowing construction. The building was completed in 1915 and first used as the Customs Examining Warehouse by the Canada Customs (then the country's customs and border security agency).Parks Canada - National Historic Sites Of Canada System Plan, Government Institutions The building was named after the Duke of Connaught, third son of Queen Victoria, who served as 10th Governor General of Canada from 1911‚Äì16. It had one basement level and seven levels above ground. In 1971, the building underwent extensive renovation and two additional levels were created by building floors inside the high ceilings of the basement and ground floors. The building subsequently comprised two basement levels and eight above grade levels (on the Sussex Drive side). The third floor also exits to MacKenzie Avenue at street level. The Connaught Building was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1990, on the basis that the building is a testament to Sir Wilfrid Laurier's commitment to the enhancement of architecture in Canada's capital, and as it is one of the best works of David Ewart. The building has been designated since 1988, as a \\"Federal Heritage Building\\" of \\"Classified\\" Status, the highest level of protection for federally owned buildings, primarily for its architectural significance.Parks Canada - Federal Heritage Buildings Review Office - Register Gallery File:Connaught Building.JPGConnaught Building File:Connaught Building NW Corner.jpgNorthwest Corner  References  External links * * Connaught Building ‚Äì Canadian Register of Historic Places Category:Federal government buildings in Ottawa Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Ottawa Category:Designated heritage properties in Ottawa Category:Office buildings in Canada ","title":"Connaught Building"},{"id":"2516215","text":"FIFM may refer to: * Festival International du Film de Marrakech, or Marrakech International Film Festival * Festival International de Films de Montr√©al, or New Montreal FilmFest ","title":"FIFM"},{"id":"2516219","text":"\\"Girl in the Tower\\" is a song from the soundtrack of the computer game King's Quest VI.

When King's Quest VI was first released on floppy disc, a pamphlet was included with the game listing various radio stations to which the song had been sent. Buyers were encouraged to call in and request that the song be played, but this campaign was unsuccessful. According to Quest Studios, Mark Seibert comments about the single: > \\"'Girl In The Tower' was an idea I came up with when I found out that > 'King's Quest VI' was going to be a love story between Alexander and > Cassima.

It includes the westernmost part of China National Highway 318 (Shanghai-Zhangmu) and crosses three passes over before dropping to at the border. The 2015 earthquakes in the region closed the highway and caused many evacuations. By 2016 there were some repairs but trading on the route was not restored to pre- quake levels. Background From Lhasa, the Friendship Highway follows the Kyi Chu river for about up to the confluence with the Yarlung Tsangpo River (Brahmaputra) at Chushul. The main route continues along the Yarlung valley up to Shigatse, Tibet's second-largest city and formerly the home of the Panchen Lamas. A subsidiary branch crosses the Yarlung Tsangpo at Chushul and crosses the high Gampa La, passes along turquoise Yamdrok Yutso lake before crossing the high Karo La at the foot of Noijin Kangsang, and following downstream the Nyang Chu valley through Gyantse up to Shigatse. From Shigatse, continuing west parallel to the Yarlung Tsangpo valley, the road passes Lhatse and forks just beyond at Chapu, where China National Highway 219 continues west and upriver, finally crossing the Brahmaputra/Indus divide near sacred Mount Kailash and Lake Manasarovar, then on to Ali in Gar County. From Chapu near Lhatse, the Friendship Highway maintains the Hwy 318 route number and turns southwest and crosses the main Brahmaputra-Ganges divide at Gyatso La (), the highest pass on the road. Descending 1,000 meters onto alluvial plains of the Bum-Chu, also known as the Arun river in Nepal, the highway passes near Shelkar (New Tingri) then through Old Tingri, both gateways to Rongbuk Monastery and the north side of Mount Everest. Continuing southwest, the highway climbs over Lalung La () and crosses shortly after the Tong La (also known as Thong La, Yakri Shung La or Yakrushong La) (), which marks the water divide between the Bum-Chu / Arun and the (Matsang Tsangpo / Sun Kosi) rivers. The Friendship Highway then descends along the Matsang Tsangpo through Nyalam, then more steeply through a canyon to Zhangmu. The road ends at the Friendship Bridge on the China-Nepal border at a mere elevation. The continuation of the road between the border town of Kodari to Kathmandu is named Arniko Rajmarg. Scenery along the highway features important cultural monuments, the upper valley of the Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra) River, vast grasslands and meadows, and mountain vistas including five of the world's highest peaks: Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Shishapangma as well as partially unexplored and unclimbed peaks east of Tong La reaching at Labuche Kang.

Pre-War A flowchart showing the history of the early British fascist movement A number of fascist movements emerged before the Second World War. Even before the March on Rome, Italian fascism gained praise in sections of the press, with articles appearing in both the Saturday Review and Pall Mall Gazette in 1921 and in The Times in 1922 praising the fascists for their strike-breaking and general anti-trade union activities.Hodgson, p. 99 On 4 November 1922 a group of black-shirted admirers of Benito Mussolini held a remembrance service at Westminster Abbey which the Workers' Socialist Federation protested, both for the group being allowed to march to the Abbey and for the fact that they were permitted to use a building as significant as Westminster Abbey in the first place.Hodgson, p. 100 However it would be 1923 before any formal group seeking to connect itself to fascism would be formed. Whilst none of these gained any parliamentary representation some of them enjoyed wider notability. Amongst the more important groups that were founded were: *The British Fascists (BF), founded in 1923 as the British Fascisti by Rotha Lintorn-Orman, one of the very few women to ever lead an avowedly fascist movement. Initially they had only a limited political platform but supported Italian fascism from 1931 to their demise in 1936.Benewick, p. 27 *The National Fascisti, a splinter group of the BF founded in 1924 that from the outset fully supported the tactics of Benito Mussolini.Benewick, p. 37 They fell apart after another group, the British National Fascisti, broke away from them.Benewick, p. 36 *The Imperial Fascist League (IFL), also a breakaway from the BF, formed by Arnold Leese in 1929. After Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany they embraced Nazism.Benewick, pp. 45-46 *The British Union of Fascists (BUF), formed in 1932 by Oswald Mosley as a successor to his New Party. The largest British fascist party, it absorbed members from other groups and called on the support of leading figures including members of the House of Lords, Commons, many Knights of the realm, as well as, for a time, the Daily Mail newspaper.PughR.J.B. Bosworth, \\"The British Press, the Conservatives, and Mussolini, 1920-34\\", Journal of Contemporary History, 1970 *The Militant Christian Patriots were a strongly anti-Semitic propaganda organisation that was formed around 1935 and briefly held a high profile.Linehan, p. 144 *The National Socialist League, a pro-Nazi breakaway from the BUF, formed in 1937 by William Joyce and John Beckett.Linehan, p. 111 It was wound up in 1939 when Joyce emigrated to Nazi Germany. *The English National Association, initially called the British National Party, sought to bring together former BUF members during the war.Dorrill, p. 529 *The Scottish Fascist Democratic Party existed in the early 1930s under William Weir Gilmour.Linehan, p. 133 Weir Gilmour had been a candidate for the New Party but had refused to join the BUF as he felt it was dominated by Roman Catholics, whom he despised.Bowd, pp. 32-34 =Minor movements= Alongside these several more minor groups that adhered to fascism were also established. Amongst those identified were: *The British Democratic Party became involved in the Coordinating Committee, an initiative of Archibald Maule Ramsay in the late 1930s. Disagreements between member parties saw this fall apart in 1939.Benewick, p. 289 *The British Empire Fascist Party, a very short-lived group set up by Graham Seton Hutchinson in November 1933. The group supported the establishment of the corporate state and was strongly anti- Semitic.Linehan, pp. 132-133 Seton Hutchinson had intended to use the name for a merger between his own National Workers Party and the BF but the latter group backed out when they realised the lack of membership of that group.Thurlow, p. 56 *The British Empire Fascists broke from the BF in the 1920s and advocated cutting wages for the highest earners.Linehan, p. 130 *The British Union (not to be confused with the BUF, which used the name British Union after the outbreak of war) emerged in the early 1930s and worked with the BF. *The British United Fascists were established in Kensington in 1933 where they had an office. They clashed with the BUF and had their office wrecked by some of that group's Blackshirts, resulting in the group disbanding soon afterwards. *The Empire Fascist Movement is mentioned in some mid 1920s reports in Socialist Review although details are missing. *The Fascist Movement was another 1920s splinter group from the BF, although little is known about it beyond its name. *Italian Fascismo was established in Leith in 1924, with a black-shirted uniform. It was entirely mimetic of Italian fascism and seemed to exist only among Edinburgh's Italian community. *The Kensington Fascist Party was set up in the late 1920s and existed well into the 1930s. Although it maintained an independent existence it tended to work closely with other, larger movements, including the BF, IFL and the Unity Band.Linehan, p. 131 In 1931 it was one of a number of minor movements to sign a document produced by the BF calling for the abolition of parliamentary government.Dorrill, p. 200 *The Legion of Loyalists was an early 1930s group, close to the BF. In 1931 it was one of a number of minor movements to sign a document produced by the BF calling for the abolition of parliamentary government. It later affiliated to the British Council Against European Commitments, a pro-German umbrella organisation founded by Viscount Lymington, in 1938.Dorrill, p. 439 Robert Benewick calls this group the League of Loyalists.Benewick, p. 287 *The Loyalty League emerged in 1922 as a group attached to the Conservative Party that sought to promote Italian fascism. The group is also described as having been established in 1923 and being strongly anti-Semitic in tone although, according to Thomas Linehan, this may have been a different group with the same name. *The National Workers Movement, later National Workers Party, was the personal party of Graham Seton Hutchinson, and appeared to have few or even no members beyond its leader.Linehan, p. 136 The group, which maintained close links to the Nordic League, also used the name National Socialist Workers Movement/Party.Thurlow, pp. 78, 80 *The New Movement existed very briefly in the early 1930s and was most likely absorbed quickly by the IFL. *The Nordics were a small group of anti-Semitic \\"racial nationalists\\" who merged with the IFL in 1934.Thurlow, p. 78 They were distinct from the Nordic League. *The Scottish Union of Fascists was set up by T.W. Denholm-Hay in 1934 as a more Scottish-minded breakaway from the BUF. Links were established with Wendy Wood and her Democratic Scottish Self- Government Organisation although it made no headway, having only 70 members upon formation. It merged into the Scottish Party.Bowd, p. 40 *The Stamford Fascists were a partial splinter group from the BF, established in 1926 when Arnold Leese and Henry Simpson were elected as councillors in Stamford in defiance of BF policy that members should not contest elections under the BF banner. Leese alone briefly changed this group into the Fascist League, before formally establishing the IFL in 1928.Linehan, p. 71 *The United Empire Fascist Party was established by C.G. Wodehouse-Temple in December 1933 and included amongst its membership Serocold Skeels, a former IFL member and agent for Nazi Germany who was eventually expelled from the party for his anti- Semitism. The group soon changed its name to United British Party, establishing offices in London and Edinburgh, and adopted a grey-shirted uniform for a while. Despite this overt militarism, which it eventually abandoned, the UBP's Fourteen Points programme was largely bereft of fascist rhetoric.Linehan, pp. 132-133 *The Unity Band was established by Lieutenant- Colonel Oscar Boulton in 1930 and was widely known for its publishing output although it had few members beyond the highly active Boulton.Linehan, p. 133 In 1931 it was one of a number of minor movements to sign a document produced by the BF calling for the abolition of parliamentary government. The two groups split the following year and they competed for the leadership of the non-BUF fascist movement for the next few years.Linehan, p. 134 Linked to the Britons, the group had a strongly Christian ethos. *The White Knights of Britain, also known as the Hooded Men, were a Ku Klux Klan-styled secret society that existed between 1937 and 1938. Deeply anti-Semitic, they used the swastika as their emblem and had Edward I of England as their patron saint due to his Edict of Expulsion against the Jews (although Edward was not a saint in any mainline Christian observance). It was close to the Nordic League, with E.H. Cole and T. Victor Rowe leading figures in both organisations.Thurlow, p. 81 *The Yorkshire Fascists emerged in the 1920s, probably from the BF and were still in existence by 1930, by which point they were close to the IFL. Post- War After the Second World War a handful of groups emerged which looked directly to fascism and Nazism for their inspiration. Those who have openly done so (in contrast with parties which merely describe themselves as aligned with nationalism) are: National Front demonstration in Yorkshire, 1970s *The Union Movement, a re-founded version of the BUF that played a pivotal role in developing the Europeanist outlook of Neo-Fascism through its Europe a Nation campaign.Thurlow, p. 214 *The British National Party (1960-1967), which until a split in 1962 produced pro-Nazi propaganda.Walker, p. 52 (This is a different party from the current BNP, although John Tyndall was a leading member of both) *The National Socialist Movement, a Colin Jordan-led breakaway from the BNP that was openly Nazi and was a charter member of the World Union of National Socialists.Walker, pp. 36-37 *The Greater Britain Movement, set up by John Tyndall when he split from the NSM, has been characterised as endorsing a specifically British form of Nazism.Goodrick-Clarke, p. 38Hill & Bell, p. 82 *The British Movement, a 1968 development form the NSM, which used images of Hitler and the swastika on election literature.Hill & Bell, p. 116 *The November 9th Society, a neo-Nazi organization founded by Terry Flynn in 1977.

Early life Arnold-Andr√©- Pierre Jeanneret-Gris was born in Geneva. He grew up in the typical Jura landscape that influenced his early childhood and his Geneva Calvinism roots. He attended the School of Fine Arts (Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Geneva). As a young student, he was a brilliant painter, artist and architect, greatly influenced by Charles-√âdouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier), his cousin and mentor for life. He was a cyclist in the Swiss Army from 1916 to 1918. Career In 1922, the Jeanneret cousins set up an architectural practice together. From 1927 to 1937 they worked together with Charlotte Perriand at the Le Corbusier-Pierre Jeanneret studio, rue de S√®vres. In 1929 the trio prepared the ‚ÄúHouse Fittings‚Äù section for the Decorative Artists Exhibition and asked for a group stand, renewing and widening the 1928 avant-garde group idea. This was refused by the Decorative Artists Committee. They resigned and founded the Union of Modern Artists (‚ÄúUnion des artistes modernes‚Äù: UAM). The cousins later designed many buildings, including a number of villas and vacation houses, and renovated existing buildings as well. Their working relationship ended when Pierre joined the French Resistance and Le Corbusier did not. However, they collaborated once again after the War, on the plan and architecture for the city of Chandigarh in India. Pierre Jeanneret in conversation with Le Corbusier at the Architect's Office (now Le Corbusier Centre) in Chandigarh Chandigarh Gandhi Bhawan Pierre Jeanneret House/Museum in Chandigarh Jeanneret, in collaboration with the English husband-wife team of Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, was responsible for much of Chandigarh's large civic architecture project. His most remarkable contribution has undoubtedly been the designing of the fourteen categories of mass-housings that constitute the living and amenity areas of Chandigarh. Jeanneret, along with Ar. Jugal Kishore Chowdhary, Ar. Bhanu Pratap Mathur and Er. Agya Ram, was responsible for a significant amount of designing for the Panjab University, including the Gandhi Bhawan and the University Library. Jeanneret stayed on in Chandigarh after its construction, advising the local government in his appointed capacity as Chief Architect of the city. In order to commemorate his legacy, the Chandigarh Administration has restored his residence, House No. 57, Sector 5 (Type 4J), and converted it into a Museum dedicated to his contributions to the city, on March 22nd, 2017, the anniversary of his 121st birthday. There were 8 linear meters of manuscripts, documents, photographs, drawings and letters between Jeanneret and Le Corbusier, which were collected over fifteen years during the Chandigarh project. They contain great detail of Jeanneret's responsibilities in the construction of the city. They were left to Jeanneret's niece, Jacqueline Jeanneret, upon his death in 1967. They are now preserved at the Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA).\\"Pierre Jeanneret\\"> Equally significant was his role as a mentor to young Indian architects like Aditya Prakash, Jeet Malhotra, Shiv Datt Sharma, and JK Chowdhary. Some of his major works in Chandigarh include the M.L.A. Hostels in Sector 3 and 4, Polytechnic for Men (now CCET) in Sector 26, the State Library, Town Hall and the Post & Telegraph Building in Sector 17, the Architects' Office (now Le Corbusier Centre) in Sector 19, the P.G.I.M.E.R. in Sector 12 (in collaboration with Jeet Malhotra, Aditya Prakash and H.S.Chopra), Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector-16, St. John's High School, Sector 26 and the Shops on V4 in Sector 11. Furniture In addition to buildings, Jeanneret also designed furniture, both independently and with Le Corbusier. He experimented with minimalist design, including a chair which required no fasteners. Death Jeanneret died on 4 December 1967. In accordance with his will, Jeanneret's ashes were scattered in Chandigarh's Sukhna Lake.

In 1981, Lerner formed a band called la Magia, playing along with bass player Hern√°n Magiano, guitarist Dami√°n Figueroa, saxophonist Oscar Kreimer, and drummer Luis Quer√≥n, releasing Alejandro Lerner y La Magia in 1982. A year later, the band broke up and he decided to start his solo career, releasing Todo a Pulm√≥n that same year and Lerner Tres in 1984. In 1998, Alejandor Lerner recorded the theme \\"Paths of the Soul\\" next to Kennedy Choir[2] and with more than 120 Argentine artists under the direction of Instrumental pianist and conductor Nazareno Andorno. In 1999, a compilation of his greatest hits, called 20 A√±os (20 Years), was released. In 2002, Lerner gained exposure in the US when he collaborated with Carlos Santana on the song \\"Hoy Es Adi√≥s\\" which was released on Santana's album Shaman.

It focuses primarily on the art and artists from the Pacific Northwest and broader western region of the U.S. Founded in 1935, the museum has strong roots in the community and anchors the university and museum district in downtown Tacoma. History The Tacoma Art Museum developed out of the Tacoma Art League, an informal gathering that began around 1891. In the 1930s, it was renamed the Tacoma Art Society, before finally becoming the Tacoma Art Museum in 1964. The museum is dedicated to collecting and exhibiting the visual arts of the American Northwest, with the mission of bringing people together through art. The museum‚Äôs permanent collection includes the premier collection of Tacoma native Dale Chihuly‚Äôs glass artwork, on permanent public display. In 1971, the L. T. Murray family (owners of the Murray Pacific Northwest timber company) gave the Tacoma Art Museum a three-story building at 12th Street and Pacific Avenue. Built in 1922, the building at 1123 Pacific Avenue previously housed the National Bank of Tacoma. In May 2003, the Tacoma Art Museum moved from this location into a new, 50,000 square foot (4,650 m¬≤) building located at 1701 Pacific Avenue, which was designed by Antoine Predock. Nearly twice the size of its previous location, the new $22 million steel and glass structure provided the space to exhibit more of the permanent collection. In designing the building, Predock drew inspiration from the region‚Äôs light, its relationship to the water, the neighborhood‚Äôs industrial history and character, Mount Rainier, the Thea Foss Waterway, and the surrounding structures in what is now known as the Museum District. Completed in November 2014, an additional $15.5 million building project has added approximately 16,000 square feet (1500 m¬≤) to the museum; it houses the Haub Family Collection of Western American Art. This established Tacoma Art Museum as the only major museum of Western American art of its caliber in the Northwest, and also enabled the museum to fully explore the art history of the West while integrating its Western and Northwest collections. Curatorial information The museum exhibits more than 3,000 pieces in its collection, two-thirds of which are classified as Northwest art. Since 1934, Tacoma Art Museum has built a permanent collection that includes work from artists such as Mary Cassatt, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Edgar Degas, Robert Henri, Edward Hopper, Robert Rauschenberg, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Jacob Lawrence, John Singer Sargent, and Andrew Wyeth. Nearly seventy percent of the collection consists of works from Northwest artists such as Guy Anderson, Morris Graves, Jacob Lawrence, Jared Pappas-Kelley, Akio Takamori, Mark Tobey, and Patti Warashina. Untitled - Stone Wave, a major work by Seattle-based sculptor Richard Rhodes, occupies the central court of the museum. The museum is known as being more open to overtly gay or queer art than most American museums. In 2012, it presented the Hide/Seek show that was censored at the National Portrait Gallery; TAM intended to present the show uncensored. The museum also planned to follow with another show curated by Jonathan Katz: Art, AIDS, America.Jen Graves, \\"This Gay Art Show: A Revolution at Tacoma Art Museum\\", The Stranger, , p. 26.
